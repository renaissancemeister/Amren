<h1>Man Gets Prison Time for Noose</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stacy Temple, News Star (Monroe, Louisiana), November 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Robert Jackson, 37, pleaded guilty June 24 on a charge of violating the Fair Housing Act by intimidating and interfering with another&rsquo;s housing rights because of race. {snip}</p>
<p>According to court testimony, the victim and her children arrived home June 13, 2008, and found a hangman&rsquo;s noose suspended from a bird-feeder underneath the carport of their home. The victim and her family relocated to Ruston from New Orleans following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Jackson later admitted placing the noose there in order &#8220;to send a message&#8221; to African-American males who visited the home.</p>
<p>&#8220;A noose is an unmistakable symbol of hate in our country, and using this symbol to intimidate a family will not be tolerated,&#8221; said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general of the civil rights division. &#8220;The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute those who resort to violent acts motivated by hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Stephanie A. Finley of the Western District of Louisiana said when a noose is used to interfere with federally protected rights, her office will prosecute.</p>
<p>&#8220;The victim and her family sought nothing more than to live in their home peacefully,&#8221; Finley said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson also was ordered upon his release from prison to attend anger management and culture diversity programs as well as being sentenced to one year of supervised release.<br>

What about violent acts motivated by something other than hate?? Like profit?</p>
<p>Something tells me that this law is intended only for White perps. I highly doubt if blacks who attack Whites, will be &#8220;vigorously prosecuted&#8221; by perez and company. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;fair housing act&#8221; has become the catch-all when dealing with thought crimes committed by whites.  It might have been in bad taste, but there was no actual crime committed besides perhaps trespassing.   </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute those who resort to violent acts motivated by hate.&rdquo; said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general of the civil rights division.</p>
<p>What an absurd and untrue statement.  Black Panther case ring a bell Perez?  Or was that not hate?</p>

		<p>It looks likes the woman, &ldquo;single mom&rdquo;, is white but had black men regularly coming over for sex.  The man hanging the noose was no doubt paying taxes to support her sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>That is the core of the trouble; white people supporting blacks.  </p>
<p>Who is more hate filled, the woman, Stephanie A. Finley, that sent a man to jail for a year for hanging a noose, or the man hanging a noose?<br>

DB Cooper asks a good question. Is Mr. Robert Jackson white or black?</p>
<p>I did a search and there are no pictures or local news videos.</p>
<p>The victim is identified as an Honduran immigrant and the noose was a said to be a message directed to black men or African American men depending on which outlet is reporting the story.</p>
<p>In these cases, the perpetrator is either identified as white or there&rsquo;s a photo.</p>
<p>If any local residents can shed light on this, please fill in the blank for us.<br>

		<p>If the  (Department of Justice) wants to help they should pursue packs of blacks to roaming around the Iowa State Fair intimidating white customers. With three consecutive nights of proclaiming; &ldquo;beat whitey nights&rdquo; one would think the (Department of Justice) would be all over this one, after all packs of blacks to roaming around the fair grounds  yelling &ldquo;beat whitey!&rdquo; is far more insidious behavior than just hanging a noose on a bird feeder. </p>

		<p>While I do not condone Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s actions, we must look at the root causes of this incident to truly understand it. Mr. Jackson was being provoked relentlessly by the repeated visits of irresponsible black males coming to engage in sexual relations with a woman of his own race. Because political correctness and institutional fascism denied him the right to express his outrage in words in mainstream society, Mr. Jackson felt that he had no choice but to voice his anger in the way that he did. He was oppressed, pressured, and painted into a corner, and quite naturally responded by lashing out. Blacks and white liberals need sensitivity training so they can learn to understand white culture and respect our values - values such as light-skinned women refraining from sexual relations with dark-skinned males. While this and other of whitey&rsquo;s ideas may seem strange, even offensive, to the Bantu and his ilk, in the name of diversity and cultural understanding they must learn to respect our ways, for to refuse to do so would be a hate crime. Oh, and with all this said, Mr. Jackson is really the victim here, and deserves our sympathy and compassion, not narrow-minded wrath.</p>
<p>There! If a black liberal assaulted a white conservative girl, THAT is what EVERY black militant and self-hating white liberal would be bleating, only with the races reversed. What&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander, right?</p>
<p>Eat these words, Leftists. Eat these words.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute those who resort to violent acts motivated by hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &#8220;motivated by hate&#8221; phrase is tacked on there at the end by Obama&rsquo;s Justice Department, for the purpose of excluding from prosecution, blacks who do exactly the same thing.  They don&rsquo;t want to prosecute people who are of the politically correct skin color.  &#8220;Hate crimes&#8221; are intended to be crimes for which only whites can be prosecuted.  Needless to say, blacks are very supportive of &#8220;hate crime laws&#8221;.<br>
However, that is not equality under the law, it is discrimination based on race, and it is the way that Obama conducts government.  The man in the White House is a black racist who practices anti-white racism.<br>

<p>THere&rsquo;s more to this story. There is no mention of this woman having a husband/father to the children<br>
Maybe I&rsquo;m a cynic but it suggests that there have been frequent visits to the house by Black males and no mention made of the antics that were going on in the neighborhood. Sound like &#8220;booty call&#8221; all right!<br>
Sooner or later there will be a shooting or stabbing or some other kind of mayhem. You can take that to the bank.<br>
Remember the poor woman in Michigan or Wisconsin who opened her home to Blacks from NOLA and they eventually murdered her.</p>

		<p>Suppose I&rsquo;m a cattle rancher from a remote area of say, Montana.  Suppose recently I&rsquo;ve had a string of cattle rustlers stealing my cattle.  In the old west were cattle rustlers not hung or lynched?  Maybe hanging a noose would be a reminder of how cattle thieves were treated in days of old.  Hypothetical situation?  Yes.  But it is a noose issue that has nothing to do with race.  Would the DOJ change it into a race issue?  Of course.</p>

		<p>You have to be pretty darn dumb to hang a noose at someone&rsquo;s home. First off it&rsquo;s not your property and you are trespassing. The best reason not to hang a noose it that it&rsquo;s a useless jesture. There hasn&rsquo;t been a black hanged in so long that it no longer sends a message of intimidation but does give them a reason for victomhood. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dumb to hang up a noose on someone else&rsquo;s property but even dumber to do it where you can be caught or admit to the incident. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like blacks, not one bit but who some Honduran womam has sex with is none of my business. What is my business is her legal status in this country. If she is an illegal immigrant then I can at least report her. Won&rsquo;t do any good but I may feel better.  </p>

		<p>The worst thing he was guilty of is trepassing and he wouldn&rsquo;t get a year in jail for that. All hate speech and fair housing<br>
laws should be repealed. FedGov has no jurisdiction in this area<br>
anyway and the order to attend cultural diversity brainwashing is pure Stalinism.</p>

		<p>I think this case was horribly mishandled. By bringing in the &#8220;fair housing authority&#8221; when there was no housing issue is fishing for a way to charge Mr Jackson with something when there was really nothing to charge him with. Obviously he was concerned with what he saw as a parade of black men coming in and out of this particular house and nobody in authority was doing (or could do anything) about it. Too many minorites are quick to sue or try to press charges about something that is either very minor or not intended to be an insult and Whites tend to suffer for it. I remember once case where a White grandmother with black grandkids (dont get me started) complained and sued the neighborhood association when a sign was hung on the pool gate with a picture of a man with a big afro that said &#8220;pool&rsquo;s closed&#8221; No word on behavior problems with the kids at said swimming pool. </p>

		<p>The Federal Government has no business in Housing, Health, Energy, Education, or any other matter not duly authorized by the Constitution. If it&rsquo;s not there, then Uncle Scam has no right to involve himself in it. </p>
<p>FDR started this nonsense with the New Deal, and it just snow balled with every other Liberal we had as President. Liberals love programs, because it gives them what they want most, which is control over everyone&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>I watched two videos recently called, &#8220;Overview of America&#8221;, and &#8220;Dollars and Sense&#8221; by the John Birch Society. I recommend AmRen readers buy and watch these DVDs. Have your children watch them, and then, share them with your family and friends.<br>

Yes, the Leftist agenda goes way deeper than Obama and Holder.  They are just fronts for the team that put them up for election or office.  If you got rid of both, there would be replacements within an instant.  It&rsquo;s not really Obama or Holder that count, IT&rsquo;S THE GANG BEHIND THEM.</p>

		<p>Is there anybody out there sympathetic to how this woman must have felt arriving at her home to see a noose hanging from a carport? </p>
<p>Do you not have any compassion? Let alone shame for your ignorant self-righteous attitudes. </p>
<p>Imagine if that were your wife, mother, aunt, sister pulling up in their car with their kids to see that - be they white, black, asian, hispanic or whatever.</p>
<p>Only a true ignoramous would find this type of behavior acceptable. And those defending this idiot ought to be ashamed of themselves. I thought we lived in Amnerica.</p>

		<p>  The woman is white and had black men come to &#8220;visit&#8221; her?  He could not find a spray can of paint in a contrasting colour some place?  Let the world know what she is. I think they spell it with two letters among her associates.  Prostitution is now legal? Let her go to court and prove she is not.  Not that anybody but a few people care in this promiscuous society.  <br>
However, if they were not noisy, messy, throwing trash around or otherwise making a nuisance of themselves, it was none of his business. <br>
You are right on olewhitelady. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute those who resort to violent acts motivated by hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fair enough goal.  However, it is complete hogwash.  The &#8220;Justice&#8221; Department will just as vigorously prosecute those who resort to peaceful acts motivated by love of one&rsquo;s own people.  This is actually a good example.  Whether he was motivated by hate or not is up for debate (we would have to hear his whole testimony), but this definately was NOT a &#8220;violent act.&#8221;  Forgive if I&rsquo;m wrong, but doesn&rsquo;t a violent act usually involve violence?  You know, someone getting hurt or something?  At least the attempt to harm someone.  But in this case, no-one was hurt, no-one tried to hurt anybody, the man was just &#8220;sending a message.&#8221;  Rude? Yes.  Despicable? I think so.  But violent?  Absolutely not, not in a legal sense at least.  Let&rsquo;s be sure to look for more twisting of the laws in the future.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be an ignoramus, nor  find it acceptable; and I am not going to defend him.  Actually, I think the guy was a jerk to put himself in such a compromising situation.  It&rsquo;s hard to sympathize with such stupidity.  Anyone who is aware of the realities in America today would know better than to try such a foolish  caper; certainly anyone who reads Amren would know better.</p>
<p>Still, the punishment here far outweights the alleged &#8220;crime&#8221;.  (What, exactly, WAS  the crime?) Maybe a charge of trespassing or defacement or property or something such would cover it, with a small fine. This goes way overboard.  But when you consider who the judge is, it suddenly adds up. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;A noose is an unmistakable symbol of hate in our country, and using this symbol to intimidate a family will not be tolerated,&rdquo; said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general of the civil rights division.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perez, huh? What country is he talking about- his, or ours?</p>
<p>Last time I looked, the noose was the proper punishment for malefactors in the American West; a malefactor is one that breaks the law of God. Considering all things, I think it was used within the bounds of that definition.</p>
