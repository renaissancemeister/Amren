<h1>Florida Reports Case of Cholera Imported From Haiti</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Letitia Stein, St. Petersburg Times, Nov. 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Collier County woman is Florida&rsquo;s first documented case of cholera imported from Haiti. The woman, who lives in southwest Florida, had been visiting family in the region of the earthquake-devastated nation that is at the center of its cholera epidemic.</p>
<p>Florida health officials said Wednesday she is doing well, and is not considered a threat to the health of others. Hers is the only confirmed case of cholera in Florida, said Dr. Thomas Torok of the Florida Department of Health&rsquo;s bureau of epidemiology. The state is investigating suspected cases, but Torok would not say more about them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cholera outbreak in Haiti, officially reported in late October, has claimed more than 1,000 lives, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Long a dreaded disease, cholera can kill within hours if left untreated. In severe cases, infected people can experience severe, watery diarrhea and vomiting that rapidly leads to dehydration. But most people who are infected do not develop any symptoms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the United States, modern water and sewage treatment programs eliminated the spread of cholera, which is rarely passed from person to person. But it remains a threat to American travelers. Each year, the WHO estimates that 3 million to 5 million cases of cholera are seen internationally. More than 100,000 people die worldwide.</p>
<p>In Haiti before the earthquake, a cholera epidemic had not been reported since the mid 19th century, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It&rsquo;s not clear how cholera arrived in Haiti, where unsanitary conditions have allowed it to flourish.</p>
<p>Florida health officials see the situation in Haiti as similar to a cholera outbreak in Latin America during the 1990s, during which the state saw about 20 cases of imported cholera.</p>

		<p>As a note to all Amrens readers:  a while back there was an article about the return of whooping cough.  I work in a city overrun by illegals and was concerned so I asked my doctor if I could get my childhood vaccinations all over again.  He said that whooping cough is included in the tetanus vaccination and as long as I keep that up to date I would be ok.  I am a avid gardener and always have my tetanus shot.  My last was 2000 and got my booster this week.  You need a booster every ten years. There may not be a cholera  vaccination but you can help yourself avoid whooping cough.<br>

		<p>Yes, no &#8220;reported&#8221; cases of Cholera in Haiti since the mid 19th century. Reported being the key word here. We know Haitian workers brought HIV back from the Congo, were there any reports of that when it occured?</p>

		<p>You can bet that cholera is only the beginning of the joy that will come from Haiti. They still have a big problem with cysticercosis on that island paradise. It comes from ingesting microscopic porcine tapeworm eggs. My understanding is that if you ingest the tapeworm embryos in undercooked meat you will get a tapeworm. However, if you ingest the eggs, which can be on the hands of people who have a porcine tapeworm, the eggs hatch out in your stomach and intestines and migrate into the bloodstream and find a happy home in the eyes or brain. They remain in embryonic form and can grow to the size of a ping pong ball. Fun, huh?</p>
<p>But, wait! I have yet more good news. Mexico is also a very good source for porcine tapeworms. There are future food workers sneaking across the border right this moment with tapeworms in their tummies and tapeworm eggs in their doo-doo and maybe on their hands.</p>
<p>Google porcine tapeworm and read all about their gifts for mankind. Then sit there in your chair and face the undeniable fact that 90% of everything you ate today was handled by an illegal alien from Mexico.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate Haiti&rsquo;s roll in the coming cysticercosis outbreak. Cholera and tapeworm eggs are both spread by doo-doo, and the cholera outbreak is proof that people are coming into contact with  material that could be contaminated by both.</p>
<p>Enjoy your supper, friends. </p>

		<p>It`s me, Tim Mc Hugh&hellip; Just wanted to get that out before I change my position and admit my error. Over the years I have stated my history of working in the food and beverge industry for 25+ years and have disputed claims that certain workers would ever contaminate food on purpose for revenge or amusement.<br>
In my own case I have never seen it happen. Once! But now, after seeing that farce of a wedding in The Maldives, where innocent tourists were mocked and ridiculed in the most base way by the natives, I am not only changing my position but reacting accordingly&hellip; Nothing like a home cooked meal in front of the TV.</p>

		<p>Oh well, at least we don&rsquo;t have bed-bugs, like previous articles have mentioned.  But seriously, Florida (south and central) are becoming a Haitians haven.  A woman at my workplace (Haitian) brought her family over after the quake.  The woman drives a BMW 3 Series (cheap low mileage lease), but had the audacity to ask office workers for &#8220;donations&#8221; to help her &#8220;immigrant&#8221; relatives.  Meanwhile, she was able to get them on various welfare programs.  Go America!</p>

		<p>I very highly recommend the documentary &#8220;Ghosts of Cite Soleil.&#8221;  You can rent it from NetFlix.  The movie clearly shows all the social pathologies of Africans   &mdash;   far too many to list here.  However one scene really stuck with me.  A couple of the local &#8220;Big Men&#8221; (thugs really) were sitting in cheap plastic chairs, smoking dope and discussing their plans for the future   &mdash;   how they want to bring justice and prosperity to their people (or maybe they might become rap stars or basket ball players).  All the while, raw sewage is flowing on the ground beneath their feet.  </p>
<p>These people live from cradle to grave in raw sewage.  They have no jobs, so they have lots of time to improve their surroundings.  They sit around and talk about achieving justice.  Yet, not a single one will pick up a shovel and dig a ditch to carry away the feces and sewage that they walk in constantly.  </p>
<p>I recently read in the paper that in one &#8220;temporary tent-camp&#8221; in Haiti there were 10,000 people and only 20 latrines.  The leftest, bleeding-heart article was pleading for Americans to donate more money to build more latrines for Haitians. Why can&rsquo;t Haitians build their own latrines? </p>
<p>What is wrong with these people?  They simply cannot help themselves.    Whites must supply their food, housing, medicine, and even dig their latrines for them.  These people are hopeless. There is no way to save them.  </p>

<p>Yes, Sonya.  I worked for the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS) in the State of Florida during the 1970&rsquo;s.  I can&rsquo;t relate the whole story here but while at HRS, the precursor to Florida&rsquo;s Dept of Health, we discovered HIV and of course it was AIDS that led us to it.  It was thought to have originated with an illegal from Haiti.  Whether or not that was one or the origin of HIV in North America, who knows.  All that I know is the Carter CDC &#8220;studied&#8221; our case an overly long time and then the report back to the State Lab in Jacksonville, Fl. just happens to be missing.  There are things happening to us as citizens that if widely known, I truly believe there would be a violent revolution.  As a health professional, I can tell you that many of us are astonished we haven&rsquo;t fallen prey to the exotic and lethal diseases brought to our shores by both illegals as well as ill, legal visitors to North America. <br>

		<p>Another delightful third-world import into the US is Chagas disease, caused by a protozoan infection.  This is spread by an insect vector (conenose bugs) or via blood transfusion, organ transplants, or eating contaminated food.  Between 8 and 11 million people in Latin America are estimated to be infected, and the disease has turned up in the southern US.  Chagas can be fatal, typically due to heart valve damage.  Animal reservoirs include opossums, raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, rats and mice, all of which are found in the US; if the disease becomes endemic here it will thus be impossible to eradicate.  The only good news is that birds seem to be immune to infection, so the spread of Chagas by migratory birds will not happen.  As Old White Jim said, enjoy that meal the illegal aliens working in the restaurant kitchen are preparing for you.</p>
<p>Fecal contamination in foods (for instance if the restaurant cook isn&rsquo;t big on washing his hands) also spreads the following parasitic diseases in addition to the tapeworm Jim mentioned: blastocystosis, dientaboebiasis, amoebiasis, giardia, isosporiasis, pinworm, roundworm, whipworm, gnathostomiasis, intestinal flukes, and shistosomiasis. </p>
