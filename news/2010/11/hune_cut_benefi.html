<h1>Hune: Cut Benefits to Illegals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Behnan, Livingston Daily (Michigan), November 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Halting social benefits to undocumented immigrants should be the first step toward eliminating Michigan&rsquo;s $1.6 billion structural deficit, state Sen.-elect Joe Hune said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State fiscal analysts said there aren&rsquo;t reliable figures on the number of illegal immigrants who actually receive social benefits, or how much that has cost the state, however.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hune said there are more than 100,000 illegal aliens in Michigan, and that all are potentially collecting taxpayer-funded benefits, including health-care services and welfare.</p>
<p>The incoming senator said he didn&rsquo;t know how many of the 100,000-plus people are collecting the benefits, or how much the state could save by cutting off the benefits, however.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said his immigration bill would be &#8220;a big component&#8221; of reigning in state spending, however, citing the Michigan League for Human Services and Center for Immigration Studies as sources for his information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most social benefits, including food assistance, health-care payments and welfare, are mostly  &mdash;  if not entirely  &mdash;  funded and dictated by federal spending guidelines, state analysts said.</p>
<p>In other words, state legislation, in almost all cases, wouldn&rsquo;t supersede federal spending rules for the programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In September, the Michigan League for Human Services issued a report that stated 1.4 percent of the state&rsquo;s total population are undocumented immigrants. That compares with undocumented aliens making up 5.8 percent of Arizona&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationally, undocumented immigrants contribute $8.5 billion annually to Medicare and Social Security  &mdash;  the country&rsquo;s largest social benefit programs  &mdash;  the report states.</p>

		<p>Can it be that we have an incoming politician with some sense? Each time I hear of the many progrsms to Americans being cut, I wait for the next line to be, &#8220;Of course, before we tamper with programs for our own citizens, we are cutting out all benefits to those who broke into our country.&#8221; I wait in vain. It just doesn&rsquo;t happen. For some reason this administration and several past ones, seems addicted to handing out money to the criminals who sneaked across our borderss. Cut the benefits, stop birthright citizenship and mandate E-verify for all business and they will self=deport. Then, the only thing we&rsquo;d have to worry about are the many bleeding hearts who wants to drown this nation with third world lawbreakers.</p>

		<p>I notice not one word about who these specific &#8220;illegals&#8221; are.</p>
<p>They are Muslims who belong to the terrorist group Hamas.  Occasionally, they put on their black masks and march around various areas near Detroit, with the obvious threat of large scale murder and mayhem once their numbers grow large enough.</p>
<p>All of them are on welfare.  This is a form of war, where the enemy troops use our social systems as a supply line.  Minimal resistance requires that, at very least, that supply line is cut.  Much more is probably necessary.  Every mosque needs to be searched for stockpiles of weapons.  The identification of all Muslims needs to be checked against databases of known terrorists.  Both would likely be found in large amounts.</p>
<p>The best thing would be, of course, to expel all Muslims from the country, but from this state in particular.  This is really no different than what was done several times in the past&hellip;.with Bolsheviks, anarchists, etc.  For the exact same reasons.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t immigrants.  Not even illegal immigrants.  They are soldiers that almost certainly have been organized by one or more hostile states&hellip;..probably Iran.</p>

		<p>Michigan is home to a large Arabic population.  In Canada, this particular group has proven very skillful at playing all parts of the system.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 300 people who claimed to live at the same address in Mississauga are being investigated by the RCMP in what police suspect may be a massive case of citizenship fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;The case revolves around an address located in the same building as Palestine House, a Mississauga centre that offers language classes and settlement services to new immigrants and also acts as an advocate for Palestinian and Arab causes.&#8221;</p>

<i>&#8220;State fiscal analysts said there aren&rsquo;t reliable figures on the number of illegal immigrants who actually receive social benefits, or how much that has cost the state, however.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>WHY NOT?</p>
<p>Are there no checks in place to screen applicants? </p>
<p>Many months ago, I was on a New York state page and they had an online application for state benefits.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I filled out the form and I got to the point where a screen came up saying &#8216;benefits were only available to legal residents&rsquo;. The next page asked, &#8216;Are you a legal resident?&rsquo; I clicked &#8216;no&rsquo; and it allowed me to finish the form.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t submit the form so I don&rsquo;t know if it would have ultimately been rejected but I thought that when I answered &#8216;no&rsquo; to &#8216;are you a legal resident&rsquo;, it wouldn&rsquo;t let me go any further.</p>
<p>I suspect asking for legal status is a formality included to deflect critics but the answer is irrelevant.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for a second that they contribute 8.5 billion a year to social security!  They throw out any number and think we believe it all. Even if they did that is miniscule to what they TAKE in our tax dollars&hellip;Why not mention all their crime rates  jail and prison costs? How about the cost of providing free education to all these illegals?  If the truth were known they cost us TRILLIONS a year.</p>

<p>Just a few years ago, Tom Brokaw claimed that illegal aliens in aggregate were contributing $50 billion a year to just Social Security alone.  I didn&rsquo;t believe it then, and I don&rsquo;t believe the $8.5 billion figure now.  For the $50 billion a year figure to be true, I calculate that you would need about 15.7 million illegal aliens working full time jobs at an average of $10 an hour.  That 15.7 million figure is more than the total number of illegal aliens they keep telling us are in country (but less than the real figure, IMHO).</p>
<p>The other problem with throwing these whatever billions of dollars illegal aliens remit in Social Security taxes is that illegal alien labor reduces the wage scale, and if not for them, the work would be done somehow in some ways at higher wages, meaning the Social Security system would have even more money.  A dollar not paid to a high wage earning native born white American that is kept in corporate profits so they can have illegal alien cheap labor is a dollar that is not subject to Social Security taxes.  Only individual wages and matching payroll taxes are subject to Social Security taxes   &mdash;   Corporate profits are not.</p>

		<p>My dad is a retired state worker. They have cut his as well as all the other municipal and state workers pensions and health benefits despite contractual obligations or years of legal precedents(this is happening all around the US). He has worked his whole life and put into the system that he now draws out of. But yet these politicians refuse to cut from those that never put into the system. Everyone has to suffer but the illegals and welfare class. Why? Are they insane? Don&rsquo;t these politicians realize that if they continue this type of blatant unfairness that when the system finally collapses that the state and municipal workers like police and fire won&rsquo;t lift a finger to protect them? I even hear that they are now considering cutting military benefits and pay. These people must be crazy to keep slamming the very people that are charged with their protection. It makes no sense. </p>

		<p>I was just a teenager when I heard that there was a &#8220;Mexican Town&#8221; located in Detroit somewhere.  Living as I was in a white bread rural area it didn&rsquo;t really register much at the time.  Now after living in a large east coast city that is literally overrun with latinos, now I know what it all means.</p>
<p>Many of the posters here mentioned that they wonder why benefits for citizens are being cut all the time, but benefits for illegal are sacrosant.  I wonder about this too.  From where I&rsquo;m living now (due to my job) I can tell you that there are very POWERFUL latino advocacy organizations now, and they are supported and funded by Jewish and white liberals.</p>

		<p>Hmmmm.  If they are ILLEGAL they aren&rsquo;t supposed to have social security numbers.<br>
How in the world are illegal aliens contributing ANYTHING into the social security fund without social security numbers????  They can&rsquo;t.  So the 8.5 billion claim is a LIE, and a bald faced lie at that.  Illegal aliens cannot, and do not, pay in to social security unless they have stolen somebody else&rsquo;s social security number, or have fabricated such a number falsely.  Which is, in itself, ANOTHER crime they are guilty of.</p>
<p>Said again, that claim is a LIE.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hune said there are more than 100,000 illegal aliens in Michigan, and that all are potentially collecting taxpayer-funded benefits, including health-care services and welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that they won&rsquo;t be collecting any benefits in the very near future, because Michigan is one of the critical states that is desperate to reduce its budget or go belly up.</p>
<p>One by one, starting with California, all 50 states will eventually have serious revenue shortfalls, even greater than what we are seeing today.  Out of 50 states, 46 are in trouble right now, and that will intensify.  The government claiming the country is over the recession is plain spin designed to fool only the most gullible.</p>
<p>The states will fall one by one just like the countries in Europe are doing right now.  The government shysters hope that putting a happy face on the state of the economy is all that will be needed to pull us up from the abyss.  Nonsense.  The economic plummet is irreversible no matter what they do.</p>
<p>The best they can do is print money and hold off the day of reckoning a bit longer.  Eventually the piper must be paid.</p>
<p>Gold wouldn&rsquo;t be at nearly $1400 an ounce if it looked like the economy was slowly recovering, and Russia and China would not have opted out of the dollar, utilizing their own currencies, if they expected an economic recovery in the US.</p>

		<p>Those of us who have been paying attention for decades know that federal and state governments seldom actually cut off benefits to the dependent class, they just change the names of the programs. For instance, the SSI program expanded to include those who got kicked off welfare when they did the window dressing reforms in the 1990&rsquo;s. The number of people on the dole never decreases. The only thing that changes is the name of the department issuing the checks.</p>

At one time Yassar Arafat&rsquo;s cousin boasted that in the Dearborn/Detroit area he could field a 30,000 man militia.  That was an armed army.  Perhaps that was just bragging and exaggeration but what if just a portion is true?  What right do illegals, hostile ones at that, have in owning weapons and threatening Americans.  That is why I no longer live in Dearborn or in Michigan for that matter.  Folks, I am less and less encouraged that we can turn this around through elections.  We know appeasement won&rsquo;t work, they will just suck our bank accounts dry and then murder us.  We must harden our hearts and deny the socialists the right to destroy our children&rsquo;s future.  Illegals must leave, all of them.  Then close the border.  No new immigrants.  Period.  Then we must severely limit welfare to those that hopelessly need it and stop all handouts to those who choose to bum off of the rest of us.  There should not be many on welfare at all.</p>

		<p>Sounds to me like you folks in Michigan are where we Whites were in California in 1994, 16 years ago, during the Prop 187 fiasco   &mdash;   with calls from certain White lawmakers (denounced widely as racists, of course) wanting to &#8216;reign in state spending&rsquo; and calling for &#8216;ending welfare benefits for illegal aliens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prop 187 got us nowhere, the budget hole is now six billion dollars and growing and illegal AND legal colonists continue to pour over the border and into California from the Third World for Free White Money. </p>
<p>This is where we are in California now (as the state government refuses to distinguish between legal and illegal colonization, both of which must stop before there aren&rsquo;t enough of us left to stop it).</p>
<p><i>Government figures show that 78 percent of all welfare recipients in California are of immigrant or nonwhite origin.</i></p>
<p><i>Immigration does not bring prosperity, but rather poverty and financial collapse&hellip; the state of California already owes $8.6 billion for welfare payments.</i></p>
<p><i>California must come up with a $362-million payment to Washington within the next twelve months just to meet current obligations. </i></p>
<p><i>Hispanics comprised welfare 50.9 percent of welfare families. A further 20.7 percent were black.</i></p>
<p>Yet California lefties like the sorry incoming slate of brown, harris, and newsom continue to tell us that &#8216;immigration is vital to the economy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to those of you outside of California!  And heed it as a dire warning, lest you find yourselves where we are now.</p>
<p>Your illegal and legal non-White population will continue to grow, fester and get worse, costing taxpayers billions of dollars.  Put a stop to it before it&rsquo;s too late   &mdash;  ignore the screams of racism before you find your own state house transformed into a bastion of entrenched, impenetrable marxists with no hope of turning them out.</p>

		<p>Bon, you are all too right!</p>
<p>For decades, big, agribusiness duped the California government (or simply bought it off, highly likely), into allowing illegal farm workers to sign up for food stamps, medicaid, as well as &#8220;bilingual&#8221; classes (really just elaborate baby sitting), so that they could pay minimum wage or less to their workers.</p>
<p>This is the essence of what is meant when I or anyone refers to the marriage between Capitallism and Marxism.  Both have been getting what they wanted, and no one was concerned about the eventual economic collapse it would cause.  And this is being done all over the Western world, and no one can stop it.</p>
<p>I just finished watching an episode of &#8220;Border Wars&#8221; on the tv.  There was one case of a young woman forced to deal with human smugglers because all of her family is in the U.S., where she had lived since she was eight.  Mexico is like a foreign country to her.  She just sat there in the ICE office crying, because she is lonely for her children and husband, and cannot get home.  If you were desperately poor and jobs were offered over the border in Mexico, along with all the other benefits, free food, medical, etc., you would go too.  The human suffering that this causes is NOT the fault of you and I, the average American.  In fact, we are often victims of the process. My career was ruined when my office was invaded, ransacked, and destroyed by a Mexican gang because I tried to stop one girl from getting beat up by a girl gang in my parking lot.  I have never recovered financially, and eventually I left California.  I pretty much feel like a stranger in my own country anymore.  But the people who ARE responsible are our government, the assemblymen (and women - I want to be PC this time!), who took bribes, allowed in more non-whites for the sake of votes for bread, and all those conservative business people who refused to acknolwedge what they were doing.</p>
<p>The rot this has caused had been festering like an abcess for decades.  We are only seeing the infection now.</p>
