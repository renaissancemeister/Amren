<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The land program had noble intent: redressing the wrongs of apartheid, when blacks were denied access to farmland, and lifting black rural people out of grinding poverty by buying farms from willing white owners and giving them to blacks.</p>
<p>It has done neither.</p>
<p>What went wrong? Ask two neighboring farmers and the answer probably will depend on their race. There&rsquo;s so much bitterness beneath the competing narratives, it&rsquo;s difficult to discern what is fact, what is misinformation and what is just an ingrained disinclination to see the other point of view.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no dispute, however, that the government has spent about $4 billion on the effort and that most of the farms have failed, raising the specter of the kind of catastrophic agricultural collapse that Zimbabwe suffered after large white-owned farms were seized and handed to political cronies.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s target, to give 30% of commercial farmland to blacks by 2014, has been put back a decade, and will cost an additional $10 billion.</p>
<p>The policy was marred by corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency. But the main problem was that, like Zimbabwe&rsquo;s program, land was handed out to people who did not know how to farm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 90% of the redistributed farms have failed, leaving idle nearly 15 million acres of once productive farmland, about 6% of South Africa&rsquo;s arable land.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johan Van Dyk purrs along the roads in a large SUV. He drifts by Michael Zulu&rsquo;s farm and another farmhouse where a white family once lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow that used to live there was murdered,&#8221; he remarks blandly.</p>
<p>Van Dyk, one of the wealthiest men in Zulu&rsquo;s district, drives by the farms now run by blacks, gesturing toward the ruined buildings, the missing tin roofs and tumbledown walls.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a white farmer now,&#8221; he says, pointing. &#8220;All the roofs are on.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty, rolling country, greened by the summer rains, but resentment and racial stereotypes slither beneath the surface. There&rsquo;s bitterness on both sides, even violence: white farmers&rsquo; dogs poisoned; break-ins, family photos smashed; farmers slain.</p>
<p>Men like Van Dyk, 56, would rather shoot a prowler dead than hit him in the leg. He calls his son a &#8220;bad shot&#8221; for doing just that to a robber, armed with a knife, who broke into their house recently. Van Dyk carries a switchblade knife. So does his wife.</p>
<p>And their black farmhands and gardeners never cross the threshold of their home.</p>
<p>Van Dyk&rsquo;s new black neighbors are disturbed by what they call his habit of carrying a gun whenever he turns up, &#8220;as if we were enemies.&#8221; They believe most white farmers are just waiting for them to fail, so they can swoop in and buy the farms back, cheap.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, Michael Zulu joined a group of about 206 blacks who called themselves the Sizanani farming company. A few were farm workers, the rest township dwellers with no farming background.</p>
<p>With government grants, they bought seven farms, elected a committee and planted crops.</p>
<p>Zulu doesn&rsquo;t know anything about the Sizanani farm finances, just that the money ran out after a few bad maize crops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We think we should go to the government again, for more money,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>From his farm on a low hill, Van Dyk looks down, in more ways than one, on his neighbor Nomvula Maya.</p>
<p>Maya, 50, took over a lease on Van Dyk&rsquo;s chicken farm after he sold it to the government two years ago for about $2.6 million  &mdash;  $850,000 less than an independent valuation.</p>
<p>He was sure that Maya would fail, and she did.</p>
<p>But Maya, an activist with the ruling African National Congress who lives in nearby Balfour, is equally certain Van Dyk is to blame. She suspects sabotage and fraud.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mayas see it differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized the financial statements were fake,&#8221; Zakhele Maya says, alleging that the cost of fuel and other expenses were inflated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had an extremely bad relationship with him,&#8221; he says bitterly, referring to Van Dyk senior. &#8220;He was trying to drive us out. Fundamentally, he&rsquo;s a white right-wing supremacist, in my view, and highly racist. And he doesn&rsquo;t believe that black people can farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him I&rsquo;d got to Wits [Witswatersrand University] studying mathematics when people said I&rsquo;d never do it. I said I didn&rsquo;t think that at this stage of my life farming chickens should be difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maya used her husband&rsquo;s retirement fund to pay the workers and the electricity bill, but soon ran out of cash. Her workers turned to Van Dyk for work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white farmer is always the bad guy,&#8221; Van Dyk drawls. &#8220;So I wonder. Why do they always come to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinking into debt, Maya couldn&rsquo;t pay the power bill or plow fire breaks around the farm. Catastrophe struck this year: A wildfire burned the chicken houses, leaving her dream in ashes.</p>
<p>The fire poisoned relations even more. In fact, the two stories of the fire are so different that it&rsquo;s difficult to decide whether someone is lying or it&rsquo;s just a terrible misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Van Dyk says that when nearby farmers went to help fight the fire, Maya&rsquo;s son refused them entry. Zakhele Maya says the white farmers came just to watch the place burn down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Van Dyk says he believes black farmers will succeed only in partnership with experienced farmers, mostly whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they must learn to farm together,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If the black farmer doesn&rsquo;t want to farm anymore, he must be allowed to sell his part to the white farmer. But that farm must not be redistributed again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nomvula Maya says she&rsquo;s had plenty of partnership proposals from whites, offering to run the property for a share of the profits, while she stays home.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, it&rsquo;s a bad attitude. It&rsquo;s an insult to me. You are telling yourself I&rsquo;m stupid and you are cleverer than me. Some of them are telling me, &#8216;Maybe you should get rid of the farm and maybe you should get a cattle farm, because it&rsquo;s difficult, this broiler farm.&rsquo; To me, that&rsquo;s an insult.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s determined to succeed and, like her neighbor Michael Zulu, wants monetary help from the government.</p>

		<p>A very predictable result.  It seems like those black farmers don&rsquo;t have much of a financial plan, but instead just pay off their bills until they run out of money, and then they try to get a government bailout while blaming the white guy.</p>
<p>I am not a farmer, but I think that a modern farm is a fairly complex operation.  Perhaps, as the article indicates, some of the black farmers could team up with white farmers in order to learn the profession.</p>
<p>It seems that the white population of South Africa is doomed unless they have a population boom.  The population is about 50 million, with whites making up about 10% (5 million).  To survive those whites are going to have to triple their population each generation&hellip;.5 x 3 = 15 million by 2040&hellip;..15 x 3= 45 million by 2070&hellip;..The black population should stabilize due to AIDS, and irresponsible living.</p>
<p>So you young white South African men and women, get to work and have about 6-8 children per family in order to save yourselves from displacement and doom!</p>

A wildfire burned the (failing) chicken houses, leaving her with insurance money?</p>
<p>This is an interesting article. It seems to be an advertisement for &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo;. Even the white man&rsquo;s blood enemy, especially his blood enemy, appars willing to go along with promoting this &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo; idea. I do believe it&rsquo;s a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>And the rest will fail also, because blacks have demonstrated repeatedly they can&rsquo;t maintain a civilized society on their own.</p>
<p>But note that the above radical leftist dreg who wrote the story seems to want readers to believe dirt poor blacks were that way under apartheid, because of evil whitey.</p>
<p>The truth is the dirt poor blacks were dirt poor, because they&rsquo;re incapable of earning, building or getting ahead in any fashion so they and millions of their look-a-likes inundated S.A. as third world hordes do to all white countries, looking for handouts.</p>
<p>The leftist fools think that somehow the whites in S.A. should have been giving blacks things and taking care of them like we do here and if they did not they&rsquo;re racist.</p>
<p>The whites in S.A. were foolish ever to have let these people inundate the beautiful country they created, because the blacks came to the prosperous community from far outside the area.</p>
<p>Like here, when the non-white hordes gain in numbers they start demanding what whites earned, along with their mentally disturbed self-hating, white cohorts, and if they aren&rsquo;t given anything they scream racism.</p>
<p>When we rid ourselves of the fools? </p>

		<p>The article says Maya could not plow fire breaks so she lost the chickens.  How about would not? I submit  she was either incomptent or lazy. I&rsquo;m not a farmer but it does not seems like it takes a whole lot of gas to plow a fire break around the chicken coups. Even if she didn&rsquo;t have a plow, fire fighters do it by hand with simple hand tools even in moutainous  terrain. </p>

		<p>Black farmers in South Africa are about as successful as Coleman Young was in governing Detroit.</p>
<p>This Maya woman is incapable of farming, and then blames her neighbor Van Dyk for thinking she can&rsquo;t farm. So her solution is to call the white farmer a racist, and go to the government for another handout. Just like Coleman Young did. </p>

<p>More like making the White farmers an offer &#8220;they couln&rsquo;t refuse&#8221; because if they did black goons would burn the place down with them in it. In this blob of liberal propaganda there is no mention of the hideous black on white violence in ZA or black incompetence, only the liberal line of blacks being impoverished by apartheid . </p>

		<p>When these farm lands are &#8220;redistributed&#8221; they become small plots not suitable for commercial farming. And not really used either for subsistence farming. Before the land was a commercial farm run as a business to produce a cash crop. As in Rhodesia, the land is now fallow. Most of those folks when they receive &#8220;deed&#8221; [the politicians usually hold onto the deed] to the land have not the money to buy seed, fertilizer, machines to cultivate, etc. And no experience at farming either. NOT an easy task. Land that when held in a commercial farm acreage was cultivated land lays there not farmed and everyone suffers.</p>
<p>Those large farms run as businesses also hired a lot of workers to perform farm chores. Those jobs gone too.</p>
<p>Also, the Rhodesian farmers were moving to neighboring Mozambique to establish commercial farms of enormous proportions. But then never heard nothing after that. Anyone know what is afoot?</p>

		<p>My understanding of farming in South Africa is that it requires advanced technology and a thorough knowledge of agriculture plus a lot of hard work. It seems white South African farmers have to be at the top of their game to make their endeavors successful. To assume black South Africans can operate at this level stretches the imagination and is tragic. </p>

		<p>In principle, running a chicken farm like Maya&rsquo;s large broiler operation is not difficult in the intellectual sense.  You have chickens that need to eat, sleep, grow, and be slaughtered in a timely fashion.  These are all well understood functions that the average university-trained mathematician should be able to easily understand.</p>
<p>In PRACTICE though, running such an operation is quite challenging.  When you have a hundred thousand or more chickens to take care of, logistics become supremely important - getting the chicken feed to the farm, properly distributing the feed and water in a timely fashion, maintaining records and controlling the temperature and sanitation of the chicken barns - it requires meticulous attention and a LOT of round-the-clock work.</p>
<p>That last bit is a killer for the would-be South African Black chicken farm owner, because it requires investment of effort and resources in a fashion that is contrary to their cultural norms.  In order to make a profitable living as a chicken farmer, obviously the &#8220;pipeline&#8221; has to be kept going at all times - young chickens enter at one end, and ready-for-slaughter chickens exit at the other.  This requires constant work, constant attention.  Few breaks, few parties, little &#8220;instant gratification&#8221; in the form of huge lump profits.</p>
<p>Worse still is the fact that the broiler operation has been raised to the level of high science thanks to American farmers who have had their techniques copied world wide.  The type and amount of feed, artificially compressed daylight cycles, every aspect of the operation has been shaved to a razor edge of efficiency.  That makes competition in the market fierce, and a farmer can lose his shirt (and his farm) by feeding too much, or too little, or paying too much for his commodities.  It really does require a surprising amount of meticulous attention to make such an operation profitable.</p>
<p>The South African government might have had better chances of success if they had given Maya a small factory and asked her to produce single-crystal jet engine fan blades.</p>
<p>Either way, her failure is obviously Whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>

		<p>The only sub-Saharan countries with their heads above water are those in which whites share rule and/or run the economy.  Gradually, they (and the Chinese) will probably assume more and more responsibility as black regimes fail.  Ruling blacks hand over land to other non-farming blacks in a spoils system, and the latter in turn hire ignorant peasants to run farms.  While the owners stay in cities, the farms languish under the hapless gaze of clueless, often lazy farmhands.  In keeping with widespread magical thinking, many blacks believe that these farms will somehow run themselves.  </p>

		<p>#3 It was not the boers, the farmers, that let all those blacks into their country.</p>
<p>They were attacked and conquered by the british when they found gold in South Africa, and begun taking in large amounts of blacks to work in the mines and other cheap labour, they not caring very much if it was boers or blacks, since both had their problems for the british empire, and blacks were at least easier to control.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
You have to make the difference between farmland, land that is being farmed, and arable land, land that could be farmed.<br>
Because most farmland is, or at least were, in the hands of white boers.<br>
But arable land existed in abundance in the large areas of land put aside for black &#8220;homelands&#8221; even under apartheid.<br>
The problem is that for transforming arable land to farmland, it requires a lot of work, something the boers have done over several generations, expanding their farms by working up the land around them, making them into productive farmlands.</p>
<p>Blacks haven&rsquo;t been willing or able to do this necessary work with the arable land that they have had access to.<br>
Instead, they want the farmland that white boers have worked hard on for years and years.<br>
And then they expect it to just &#8220;work&#8221; without doing very much labor, completely failing to realize that the white boers doesn&rsquo;t just sit around on their asses and enjoying their riches, like they&rsquo;ve been told by media, ANC, leftists and so on, but that the boers actually work, a lot.</p>
<p>Ans also in their arrogance (which is not limited to south african blacks, or even only blacks) that a farm is something easy to run, not very much different from your vegetable patch at home.<br>
But a commercial farm, like any other business, is something that requires knowledge and skill in what you are doing, modern farming has very little to do with vegetable patches or 17th century methods. You have to invest a lot, both resources and work, in order to get the &#8220;payout&#8221; when the crop is done.<br>
Farmers have to have a hard grip on the economy, because the paycheck doesn&rsquo;t come once a month or bi-weekly. But you get one or two big paychecks a year, and this you have to stretch out so that it will cover the expensive for all those months when you effectively have no income.</p>
<p>Blacks just see that one big paycheck the farmers get maybe once a year, and somehow think that it is the monthly income.<br>
So when they get their big chunk of cash they party it up (a bit like blacks in USA, which also have trouble saving money&hellip;) which means they won&rsquo;t have the means necessary to get the farm what it needs until it is time for the next big chunk of cash.</p>

		<p>Reading this piece one gets the feeling that the author is expressing a sense of puzzlement when noting that black farmers fail in SA.  In fact blacks fail at practically anything when compared with the performance of any other racial groups, the one exception being their performance at athletic endeavors. If Beverly Hills were awarded to randomly selected blacks (with an annual family income of $500,000/year thrown in) the place would look like the slums of Detroit within a decade.<br>

		<p>Those black south african farmers should apply for some of those funds that the U.S. government is paying to black farmers in the states for past &#8216;discrimination.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>I heard the numbers applying are many times more than there ever was of black farmers.  A few thousand more blacks from other countries shouldn&rsquo;t matter much.  Right?  </p>
<p>After all, it must be the fault of white people that black farms don&rsquo;t succeed, and all white people are the same, regardless of borders.  Right?</p>

		<p>They used to call these kinds of things &#8216;family farms&rsquo; and supposedly families had a lot of kids so a lot of work could be done. That must have been long ago. Are they still family farms?</p>
<p>Perhaps the building block is the family part. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m always in awe of the brain power of the average black African ;-)  There effectively given a farm.  White farmers offer to lease the farm.  Money for nothing to the redistribution farmer, but there not even smart enough to do that&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Having lived in SA until 1999 when we escaped the terrible crime and the forecast future of another Zimbabwe, I can only concur with the opinions above.  Black Africans, as opposed to white Africans, are used to subsistence farming where the land is farmed for a couple of years until it is infertile and the farmer moves on to the next land (that is a major reason that no permanent buildings were found when the first Europeans arrived which was OK in the days before the European turned up in the 17th Century) and the population growth rocketed (millions over the years moved down from central Africa to SA to where the life was good under the white man) because the economies grew so there were jobs to be had and disease etc was much reduced, but it is sadly true that black farmers are in the main unable to run efficient successful farming enterprises.  One reason is laziness as they are not willing to spend the time and effort on the land, but a glaring example was the Zebedelia Fruit farm in the then Western Transvaal due west of Johannesburg.  (The new ANC Govt has changed many of the names so it is now called Limpopo in Mpumalhanga.)  The farm was compulsorily purchased in the 1990s from the white family who had built it up over the preceding 80 years and handed to a local tribe, the leaders of which voted themselves large salaries and started to live the high life while the farm gradually died.  Zebedelia was the largest fruit farm in the Southern Hemisphere, producing, in season, 15 000 cases of oranges a day, but within 18 months the trees were all dead, the machinery scrap due to no servicing, the many farm houses derelict having been physically stolen by the locals and the accounts so much in the red that even those who had been sent on pension in the preceding years on retirement had their pensions stopped as the banks grabbed all the assets they could to settle enormous debts.  The previous dispossessed owners had offered to work at first for the new owners but the offer was refused.  Eventually the new owners were forced to call in a new manager, a farmer who had been forced out of Zimbabwe so things have since picked up again.  The new manager is white, of course.</p>
<p>Why is it that so many people refuse to believe the truth when facts are aired about black Africans?  I have been called a racist here where I am retired with my wife because I have stated facts that are very easy to confirm.  The whites everywhere are doing the blacks a great dis-service by not forcing them to come to grips with their problems themselves, and before we left, I had black friends and acquaintances where when we discussed the problems there at social events, and who agreed with my opinions as written here before begging us not to flee the new, very violent and corrupt South Africa.</p>
<p>Now aged 72, but still fit for this age, I guess I am not long for this planet so I am not afraid to voice my considered opinions.</p>

		<p>the main problem was that, like Zimbabwe&rsquo;s program, land was handed out to people who did not know how to farm.<br>
 <br>
- Robyn Dixon, Los Angeles Times, November 21, 2010<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Blacks in Africa have practiced agriculture for at least two thousand five hundred years. They learned from the Nubians. These were a black nation immediately south of Egypt who adopted much of Egyptian civilization. At one time Egypt was governed by a Nubian dynasty.   <br>
 <br>
By contrast, agriculture was originated in the West by Caucasians in the fertile crescent about ten thousand years ago.  It entered Europe about eight thousand years ago.  The Nordic residents of South Africa have been using it for about seven thousand years.<br>
 <br>
Agriculture exerts different populations pressures than a hunter gatherer existence.  One must be able to plan for the future. One must be able to defer gratification.  No matter how hungry one gets, one cannot eat one&rsquo;s seed corn or butcher all of one&rsquo;s farm animals.  One needs to be able to endure long periods of tedious, repetitious labor.  One should be able to get along with one&rsquo;s neighbors, even if one does not like them.<br>
 <br>
Because of their different genetic heritages we should not expect most black South Africans to become as adept at agriculture as most white South Africans.  Nevertheless, most can learn. In addition to giving them land, the South African government should teach them modern farming methods.  <br>
 <br>
Throughout history peasant owned farms have usually been more productive than large estates farmed by slaves, serfs, or landless farm laborers.  Moreover, land owning peasants have usually exerted conservative, stabilizing effects on society.    </p>

		<p>This really comes as a great shock to me. I read somewhere that all of the Blacks in Africa were Egyptians who could fly and move heavy objects using only their powerful minds. I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought they&rsquo;d have trouble getting plants to grow. This whole story must have been made up by envious, racist Whites. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re being rather unkind to hyenas, by comparing them to Bantus robbing and looting like they did during Hurricane Katrina&rsquo;s visit to New Orleans, or Oakland, CA earlier this year.</p>
<p>Actually, hyenas do a fair amount of hunting for food, in addition to scavenging. In fact, gazelles on the Savannah can tell the difference when a hyena pack is scavenging for food, and when it is hunting for food.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, danjack, I think the termites in Africa build sounder structures than do the Bantus. Have you ever seen a termite mound in Africa, on one of those &#8220;nature programs&#8221;? They are impressive, considering they were built by blind insects!</p>

		<p>several years ago, I listen to a BBC report on an initiative in black Africa, sponsored by international development agencies, which promised to revolutionize health and sanitation throughout black Africa.</p>
<p>celebrities and pop singers throughout the continent were being  mobilized to visit villages, delivering the message in song form.</p>
<p>the message was:</p>
<p>dig a hole in the ground to use for human waste, do not deposit human wastes directly into your drinking water supply.</p>
<p>for the most part, the message seemed to fall on deaf ears, but the program&rsquo;s proponents remained hopeful that eventually, given enough singing, dancing, celebrity visits, and other incentives, the message would sink in.</p>
<p>I wonder if there has been any progress since then?</p>

		<p>I think it was a few years ago, when even German do-gooders had to rub their eyes:<br>
On the hundreds of boats of black immigrants to Europe, they found some people from South Africa. They said, they want to escape hunger! I have seen some North-African people now, they look like Europeans. Some have green and blue eyes. But most are mix-colored.<br>
Even this mix-colored people are so angry about immigrants and their behavior, that the police sometimes pick up some immigrants and drive them with cars an no food to the deserts. More and more of their police can not go for normal crimes but have to look for immigrants all the time.</p>
<p>They are really seen as a pest here. They make babys like crazy, don&rsquo;t want to behave and everywhere they go it is loud, smelly and it gets criminal.</p>

<p><i>The fire poisoned relations even more. In fact, the two stories of the fire are so different that it&rsquo;s difficult to decide whether someone is lying or it&rsquo;s just a terrible misunderstanding.</i></p>

Is it really &#8220;difficult to decide whether someone is lying&#8221; in South Africa? When the white people in the article generally talk sense and the black people in the article generally talk nonsense&hellip; and make unfounded accusations against their white neighbors&hellip; and complain they need more and more and more handouts and help from the government&hellip; well, I don&rsquo;t find taking sides to be difficult at all. </p>
<p>In fact, the whole issue is really quite simple. Allow me to boil it down to a choice so simple, even someone as IQ-deprived as a bantu or an LA Times reporter can comprehend it:  </p>
<p>You take the side of the experienced white farmers, and everybody eats. Side with the inexperienced (and apparently incompetent) black farmers, and everybody starves. </p>

		<p>Blacks are the same everywhere = same gene pool.  Blacks always see the government as a never ending piggy bank and always raging against their genes.  Racism is seen everywhere as an excuse to hate and not look directly at their own deficiencies.  Russia/China had their socialism/communism experiments = failures.  The Western nations also had the same socialism experiments except it called, catering to blacks/Hispanics.  The masses are in bondage to minorities due to incompetent delusional leadership.  Communistic /socialism is alive and well in this country as the voters unwittingly voted a hidden one into the White House.  See Manchurian President.  Barry has learned his Saul Alinsky lessons well = boring deep into institutions to bring it down.  How many of the readers on this board know that within the &ldquo;health care reform&rdquo; are provisions to eliminate Medicare over a period of time by cutting the fees paid to providers?</p>

Ha ha kind of sums up the whole problem with affirmative action, allowing a pushy arrogant black female into to ever higher levels of academic learning,  surprisingly does not miraculously give her the basic intelligence to perform simple jobs like chicken farming.  According to the liberal and black mindset, blacks are all Einsteins with untapped potential, ready to dazzle us with their scholastic acheivement if only someone would give them a chance!</p>
<p>Note that this woman in the article, a ANC politically connected black female who probably used her connections to force her way into the university &#8220;studied&#8221; mathematics, not that she has a degree in mathematics.  I think just about every college program makes you take basic math in your first year. My friends who did nothing but drink and dropped out of college after the first semester could make the same claim as her.</p>

		<p>I see a similar thing here in my city which is 62% black. The blacks can always seem to get a SBA loan to start or buy a business. For a couple of years they are flying high and living the good life with their high salaries. As soon as the credit lines are tapped out the business fails. I have seen this many times, and only know of one that has made it and he has a mom and pop operation and actually works long and hard and deserves to make it. Over and over this happens yet my tax dollars keep funding businesses almost 100% certain destined to fail. When will the governments learn,,  never when it comes to blacks!!!   KF</p>

		<p>A.J. #36: You remind me of a story that I just read on the Northern Voices Book Store web site. </p>
<p>I read the article with a combined sense of interest and outrage, which described a Wisconsin High School Senior, who was denied a Scholarship to Wisconsin State University, and too many other Colleges and Universities to mention, even though the student in question had a 4.14 GPA, over the perfect 4.0 GPA average. </p>
<p>This White student, yes, you knew he had to be White, also competed and succeeded in Track and Wrestling, as well, winning many awards. </p>
<p>The White student was also involved in his local Community, engaged in Charity work through his Christian Fellowship membership. </p>
<p>So, why wasn&rsquo;t he awarded a Scholarship, where any College Team would, at one time, bend over backwards to get him to their School? Because he is not Black. Big surprise.</p>
<p>Instead, Colleges run around offering Scholarships to far less qualified Blacks, who also have drug and violence issues, but why should that stop a poor black from going to College? </p>
<p>We all know that their minds are terrible things, and they don&rsquo;t want to waste them, especially on Academic work, and study, when they can be out selling drugs, and committing rapes, on and off Campus. </p>
<p>The White Wisconsin student was Red Shirted, a Walk-on, at San Jose College, and after one African prize injured himself, found an opportunity to let his talents shine. And he did, as he outproformed all other Black Scholarship Team members, in that game alone. </p>
<p>The name of the original article is &#8220;Caste Football&#8221;. </p>
<p>AmRen readers can read this complete story at www.castefootball.us . </p>
<p>Please send this article to others, or print it, and hand them out, so Whites can get another unvarnished look at the anti-White racsim that is all too prevalent in our Society. </p>
<p>Maybe this and other articles like it will anger enough people to change this nonsense. </p>
