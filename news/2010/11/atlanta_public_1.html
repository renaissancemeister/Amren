<h1>Atlanta Public Schools Cheating | Some Teachers Admit Guilt</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Rankin, Heather Vogell, and Alan Judd, Atlanta Journal-Consitution, November 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Numerous Atlanta Public Schools employees have confessed to changing students&rsquo; test papers, providing answers to students or watching others manipulate tests, according to an official briefed on the state&rsquo;s investigation into cheating on standardized tests.</p>
<p>The official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said some teachers are telling investigators, &#8220;I&rsquo;m guilty. Here&rsquo;s what I did. Here&rsquo;s what I know happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>The revelation comes as criminal charges against APS employees appear increasingly likely as a result of the state&rsquo;s investigation. GBI director Vernon Keenan and two special investigators on Monday met with Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>GBI officials have said teachers are not targets for criminal charges as long as they are truthful with agents and investigators. But administrators may be.</p>
<p>Potential felony charges that educators could face include lying to agents or investigators, which could bring up to five years in prison, and the destruction or altering of public documents, which could result in up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Atlanta district spokesman Keith Bromery said, &#8220;We are fully cooperating with this investigation, wherever it may lead,&#8221; but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>The official who spoke with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution did not know how many school system employees have confessed or provided evidence against superiors.</p>
<p>It is unlikely, the official said, that the number has exceeded the 108 Atlanta educators that were referred to the state Professional Standards Commission for possible disciplinary action last August.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stories in the AJC in 2008 and 2009 revealed some Atlanta public schools were posting statistically unbelievable scores on state CRCT. In February, state officials announced they had found suspicious erasures on answer sheets for last year&rsquo;s tests in hundreds of classrooms at Atlanta elementary and middle schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some teachers&rsquo; representatives have complained about the GBI&rsquo;s approach in questioning educators.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very intimidating for teachers,&#8221; said Michael McGonigle, director of legal services for the educators&rsquo; advocacy group the Georgia Association of Educators. &#8220;They really do feel badgered and bullied.&#8221;</p>
<p>APS Superintendent Beverly Hall, who has announced plans to leave when her contract expires in June, issued a memo to all employees earlier this year instructing them to cooperate with the state investigation. She had not given similar orders during the blue ribbon commission&rsquo;s investigation.<br>

		<p>It is unrealistic to expect teachers of poor blacks to get good results, and unfair to punish them when they do not.  <br>
 <br>
No Child Left Behind makes public school teachers even more reluctant than they already were to teach in inner city schools, and promotes this kind of cheating. </p>

<p>Blacks are less intelligent with few abilities, so what else can they do but cheat in order to raise their test scores?</p>
<p>Look at the community organizer.  Does anyone really believe this man is &#8220;brilliant, when he hides his test scores and the few writings he&rsquo;s completed, if they were not sub-standard?</p>
<p>The only work of his we&rsquo;ve read are the books written for him by the traitor and seditionist Bill Ayers.</p>

<p>LOL!</p>
<p>Guess they didn&rsquo;t get the memo   &mdash;   as we did in my district   &mdash;   that ETS (Educational Testing Services) has a new program that flags as suspicious &#8216;too many erasures&rsquo; on answer sheets. </p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to all teachers and administrators!</p>

		<p>South park tackled this topic a few seasons back when Eric Cartmen disguised himself as a middle aged hispanic high school teacher and taught a class of typical black/mestizo public school students to cheat there way into college and was hailed as a educational genius!</p>

		<p>I have worked in urban, public education for many years now.  The cheating going on is off the charts.  But it&rsquo;s usually not the teachers, because teachers in general have some self-respect about what they teach.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s students cheat on anything and everything they can.  Sometimes do blatantly as to be stupid.  I teach Latino students.  90% of them copy from each other.  Almost no one has enough integrity to actually do their own work.</p>
<p>I also HAVE seen administrators to shady things.  They play with the data, manipulate it and do outright fraud.  I had one principal, an affirmative action hire, who gave kids credits for classes that they never attended.  How do I know this, because I WAS TOLD by that man to sign off on it.  When I hesitated, I was told that he didn&rsquo;t need my signature and would give the kid credit anyway.  </p>
<p>Needless to say, I, and several other teachers, were on his hit list.  (Thank God for tenure.)  At the end of the year, half the staff transferred out.</p>

<p>I find it rather interesting that authors Bill Rankin, Heather Vogell, and Alan Judd seem to display remarkably little interest in finding out <i>why</i> the teachers in question would deliberately fudge test scores upward.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be that it&rsquo;s the only way to achieve Imperially-mandated &#8220;equality,&#8221; could it?  Oh, perish the thought!</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s really amazing about this is how all these black teachers and administrators literally screwed these black kids for years to keep their &#8220;numbers&#8221; up and protect their jobs.  In the early days of the investigation attempts to use the race card were laughed away by auditors but they&rsquo;re still on the fence about criminal charges?  Atlanta is such an amazing contradiction and yet a perfect example of what happens when blacks are left to run things with no effective oversight.  In fact, oversight is exactly where most blacks drop the ball since they don&rsquo;t like to have anyone looking over their shoulder.  Maybe because they are inclined to choose the lazy way out far too often.  Faking grades has faked the education of these black kids and the betrayal came from other blacks.  Yet, black parents are silent.  They should be in the streets with pitch forks and torches headed toward the BOE led by the Jesse and Al show.  Only the press keeps this story going.  Black parents would rather protect other blacks than their own children.  How can such a culture survive at all without white help?<br>

		<p>In South Africa it happens all the time in rural black schools that a teacher literally sit with a open math or science textbook and help the kids during the final exam and they openly discuss questions, and then they fail anyway. Nowadays they use computers to produce stats that shows if there is no variances in a group at any school.</p>
<p>Evil, racist, white-computer-programmers; ruining the closure of the achievement-gap.</p>
<p>But seriously the stats are bewildering. I don&rsquo;t think it is broken down by race any longer, but 10 years after apartheid(in 1995) only around 250,000 odd kids got university exemption with math on higher grade standard of which less then 2000 was black. Bear in mind whites only make up +- 7% of that demographic group. They can blame colonialism and apartheid all they want, but before the first white man stopped here, illiteracy was 100%. Blacks suffer from an unresolved spiritual contradiction, he is simultaneously saying: &#8220;why did you colonize us and why didn&rsquo;t you colonize us more.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Recently in my city a black female principal was fired for grade alterations. I have a suspicion grade changing by blacks is so widespread as to include most if not practically all schools administered by black folk. What is important to them is to get the piece of paper. It does not matter whether they earned it or not. I wonder how many white people participate in this scheme.</p>

		<p>the level of cheating has to be seen to be believed.</p>
<p>I taught briefly at a prestigious Manhattan college of art.</p>
<p>I was ordered by the Dean to give a passing grade to a retarded black student (a teenager who produced a child in the middle of the term despite living with quite articulate white foster parents).</p>
<p>she was unable to speak, write, or read about a first-grade level.</p>
<p>her IQ is probably around 75.</p>
<p>for the final exam, she scribbled five or six disconnected words (no grammar) which suggested to me that she did not know whether Picasso was a person, place, work of art, style, or media.</p>
<p>to her credit, she did not cheat, she did not do anything.</p>
<p>I was instructed by the dean to give her a passing grade, and I assume she got her bachelor&rsquo;s degree from this institution.</p>
<p>when blacks (and by now, quite a few whites as well) brag about their degrees of higher education,1 should recall that they essentially behaved like items of furniture during their courses, learned and understood nothing.</p>
<p>a high school diploma means that you can go to the bathroom all by yourself.</p>
<p>a college degree means you can use a knife and fork.</p>
<p>a Ph.D. means you can cross the street by yourself.</p>
<p>this is how civilizations collapse.</p>

As one who lives outside the metro Atlanta area who has a good friend who, two years ago, was Chairman of our county Board of &#8216;Edumacation&rsquo;, I can relate to you this story about the black parents (term used loosely).</p>
<p>Our friend was a very good man, wanting to improve the schools, wanting fairness (that was his first mistake. I warned him about getting into that job.) He told us this story, which was later verified by some Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputies we know who were in attendence. At a Board of Ed meeting just before &#8216;gradumacation&rsquo; a large number of black women (mother  figures, as, of course, there were no male/father figures in the picture) physically stormed the dais, swinging fists, throwing things at and cussing out the Board members because the Board actually voted to not allow any student without a passing grade to &#8216;walk&rsquo; in the &#8216;gradumacation&rsquo; ceremony. One irate woman screeched, &#8220;You&rsquo;re ruinin&rsquo; mah  chall&rsquo;s LAFF!!&#8221;  Never mind that her &#8216;chall&rsquo; had two years and three attempts to pass a CRCT test, only reguiring the bare minimum. Our friend, the Chairman asked her, &#8220;Where were you the twelve years she was in school? Why didn&rsquo;t you see to it that she turned in homework, that she made passing grades? Now you show up, mad with US that your DAUGHTER failed. You&rsquo;re not interested in her actually LEARNING anything; it&rsquo;s more important to you that you get a picture of her in a cap and gown than her getting an education! YOU&rsquo;RE the one who failed; not her! Not having a picture of her in a cap and gown will not ruin her life. YOU&rsquo;re the one ruining your child&rsquo;s life.  &#8220;</p>
<p>Well, that started a near riot; the Sheriff&rsquo;s office was called, fisticuffs broke out, and several mothers AND teenage daughters got arrested.</p>
