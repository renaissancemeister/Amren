<h1>In Likely Parting Shot, Civil Rights Commission Approves Controversial Report On Justice Department Action</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Levine, Fox News, Nov. 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights approved Friday its latest report on the Justice Department&rsquo;s handling of a controversial civil rights case, even though the report makes no findings related to the case or the larger question of whether the Justice Department enforces civil rights laws in an even-handed manner.</p>
<p>The move marked what is likely to be a parting shot for conservative members, who are expected to become the minority and lose control of the commission in December.</p>
<p>For more than a year the commission has been investigating why the Obama administration reversed course on a federal lawsuit against two members of the New Black Panther Party, who some say intimidated Pennsylvania voters on Election Day 2008. The Justice Department sent its Civil Rights Division chief to testify and provided thousands of pages of documents to the commission, but some members still accuse the Justice Department of &#8220;stonewalling&#8221; by withholding what they describe as &#8220;highly relevant&#8221; documents and information.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot in good faith come up with a comprehensive report,&#8221; Republican commissioner Peter Kirsanow said during Friday&rsquo;s hearing before the vote. &#8220;I suspect that one of the reasons why we have not been getting this information is because &hellip; in a couple of weeks the composition of this commission is going to change. At that point, there is a fairly good likelihood that this investigation would cease.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s investigation expanded  &mdash;  and heated up  &mdash;  after two attorneys heavily involved in the initial filing of the case, including one still with the Justice Department, testified that it was all part of a &#8220;hostile&#8221; attitude by the Obama administration toward &#8220;race-neutral enforcement&#8221; of voting rights laws. The Justice Department has repeatedly denied such allegations, pointing to a case currently being prosecuted involving a black defendant who allegedly tried to disenfranchise white voters.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the latest report approved Friday apparently draws heavily from allegations made by the two attorneys, with the report saying their testimony &#8220;provides a possible explanation&#8221; for the ultimate disposition of the New Black Panther party case and &#8220;may explain why the Department refuses to provide information that would allow the Commission to complete its job.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Democratic commissioner Michael Yaki, the sole dissenting voice to attend Friday&rsquo;s vote, said it is the commission itself that is at war with its core mission, insisting the commission&rsquo;s year-long investigation has been &#8220;reckless&#8221; and a &#8220;travesty of justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alleging &#8220;omission&#8221; and &#8220;suppression&#8221; of &#8220;key facts,&#8221; Yaki said the &#8220;bias&#8221; in the report is quite &#8220;astonishing.&#8221; Sworn testimony by Justice Department attorney Christopher Coates and former attorney J. Christian Adams, both critics of the Obama administration, are regarded in the report as &#8220;the immaculate words coming down on us &hellip; with nothing that can be challenged about them,&#8221; but others&rsquo; sworn statements disputing their testimony are &#8220;put in the footnotes, disregarded, pretty much ignored,&#8221; according to Yaki.</p>
<p>In addition, he said, the continuing case of Ike Brown, a Democratic official in Mississippi accused of devising a scheme to disenfranchise white voters, &#8220;just vanishes&#8221; in the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one immutable fact, the one proof, the one action that you can point to that shows that Justice is in fact enforcing the laws in a race-neutral fashion basically takes a dive,&#8221; Yaki said of the report, which has yet to be officially released.</p>
<p>The other commissioners at the hearing Friday took issue with Yaki&rsquo;s assessment, insisting the investigation was warranted and the commission produced a &#8220;good report&#8221; that includes &#8220;fairly startling evidence&#8221; from &#8220;a couple of whistleblowers.&#8221; The latest version of the report was approved by a vote of 5-2, with one commissioner voting against the report via phone.</p>

		<p>The EEOC should be abolished, and the Justice department should be investigated for bias, competence, and honesty, because they&rsquo;re sadly lacking in all three.</p>
<p>The country is fast becoming dysfunctional under this black racist in power, the black white-haters he has appointed, and  the kooky self-hating white extremists. All of them are deteriorating the country further toward a Zimbabwe/South Arica style of incompetence and corruption.</p>
<p>A day or two ago, the community organizer flippantly declared to the news crew on his way to the US that he was going to make a stop in Venezuela to talk to Hugo Chavez.  A leftist CNN reporter said Obama was acting &#8220;punchy.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I and others on here have pointed out that this arrogant incompetent will be cracking badly as soon as he and his policies come under severe criticism, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing right now. If the situation continues to direct severe criticism his way, he&rsquo;s going to be dangerous, because he&rsquo;s in love with himself, he hates whites and America, and he isn&rsquo;t mentally stable enough to withstand too much pressure.  He&rsquo;ll become unhinged when the criticism is ratcheted up.</p>
<p>When that occurs, he&rsquo;s capable of doing and saying almost anything.  He has already condemned the police in Massachusetts for properly arresting a ghetto talking black AA professor, and he still refuses to prosecute radical black panthers&hellip;&hellip; who declare they want to kill whites and their blond hair, blue-eyed babies&hellip;&hellip; for carrying clubs at polling places saying they were there to make sure the black man rules over whites&hellip;or words to that effect.</p>
<p>Besides all the many ills this nation is facing, we&rsquo;re going to  soon have a black president that will be using his power of office to abuse whites somehow.</p>
<p>Be prepared!</p>

		<p>Why is this commission changing to become heavily democrat?</p>
<p>The article mentions that this fact is likely to result in the investigation of these serious crimes to disappear but fails to mention on what basis the makeup of the commission is changing.  We just had an election where the republicans took major ground away from the democrats so this is not an election based phenomena.</p>
<p>Further, to those who say it does not matter which party holds power, both are anti-white, notice how republicans are attempting to uphold the civil rights of white people, under a tremendous, illegal, unjust effort by the democrats.  Obviously, there are serious differences between the parties with regard to the rights of white people.  Perhaps it is not completely reliable&hellip;.voting republican is no guarantee of a representative that looks out for white interests.  But the fact is that the republicans are far more active in white rights than the democrats.  And here is a perfect example.</p>
<p>This can and should be made overt, and intensified.  In other words, the republican party can and SHOULD be converted to white nationalism.  Many are halfway there already.</p>
