<h1>Where Cherished Values Collide</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Margaret Wente, Toronto Globe and Mail, November 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oh, dear. Maclean&rsquo;s has stepped in it again. &#8220;Too Asian?&#8221; it asked provocatively in its universities issue. The article alleged that some preppy, privileged white kids seem to think so. They&rsquo;re passing up campuses like the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia because they&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;ll have to work too hard to keep up with the growing number of Asian kids. They want to drink and party and play volleyball, and Asian students just want to study hard and get A-pluses.</p>
<p>Vicious ethnic stereotyping? I don&rsquo;t think so. The headline was a (perhaps too) cheeky hook for an important subject. But others did not agree. &#8220;Disgracefully xenophobic,&#8221; fumed some. &#8220;Racist,&#8221; insisted others. The harshest criticism came from those who saw alarming parallels between the attitudes expressed in the article and the attitudes of white elites in the 1920s who imposed Jewish quotas. &#8220;It echoes the anti-Semitism of old  &mdash;  that a disproportionate number of Jewish kids were coming into the Ivy League,&#8221; argued Jeet Heer on the CBC radio show Q. Because he took a shot at me during the show (and because the subject is important), I shall now attempt to explain why neither I nor Maclean&rsquo;s are anti-Asian.</p>
<p>The growing Asian presence on North American campuses is a big story  &mdash;  culturally, demographically, politically. It&rsquo;s also a story that pits some of our most cherished values against each other. We believe that our public universities should broadly reflect society. We also believe they should be meritocratic. But what if those two values collide?</p>
<p>Consider the University of California at Berkeley, once famous for its hippie radicals and free-speech rallies. These days, all is quiet on the campus, because everyone is studying. Although Asian-Americans make up about 12 per cent of California&rsquo;s population, Berkeley&rsquo;s current freshman class is 42 per cent Asian, and the unofficial second language is Mandarin. Most of the Asian students are the kids of immigrants. So what&rsquo;s the draw? As freshman Jonathan Hu explained to The New York Times, &#8220;It&rsquo;s the intellectual atmosphere  &mdash;  this place is intense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asians make up less than 5 per cent of the U.S. population, but 10 to 30 per cent of students at the top colleges. Yet because of affirmative action (i.e., racial engineering), Asians applying to top U.S. schools need significantly higher SAT scores than other groups. In that way they are, indeed, the new Jews. If academic performance were all that counted, the numbers would be even higher.</p>
<p>They are the new Jews in other ways as well. Many Asian kids come from cultures where children are supposed to work hard and defer gratification, and where being educated is the most honourable thing to do. Both cultures, not coincidentally, are also known for pushy parents.</p>
<p>UBC is currently the most Asian campus in Canada. While Chinese-, Korean- and Japanese-Canadians make up only 21.5 per cent of Vancouver&rsquo;s residents, they make up 43 per cent of UBC undergraduates. Because of high Asian immigration rates to Canada, the numbers are bound to increase. But here, the Jewish analogy breaks down  &mdash;  nobody is talking about quotas. (Least of all me.) If anything, they&rsquo;re talking about how to instill a less self-indulgent work ethic among kids who&rsquo;ve been raised on the gospel of self-actualization and self-esteem.</p>
<p>The rise of the Asian campus is a good thing. It reflects the meritocracy at work. It also introduces a variety of important social questions. We shouldn&rsquo;t be too timid to discuss them.</p>

<p>Notice all the &#8220;selfs&#8221; and how that can be a bad thing. I agree. I&rsquo;ve been saying white kids would benefit from a white identity and the social supports that tie them together as an ethnic group. Any objective observer would have to admit this is a valid option. But don&rsquo;t expect this journalist to include this possibility among the important social questions she isn&rsquo;t too timid to discuss.</p>

		<p>In all the exchanges related to this story the excuse given for white flight from the universities is that white Canadians have a moral and personal failing - they want less study and more socializing.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to ask them their reasons.  </p>
<p>To do so may reveal a taboo - races enjoy the company of their own kind.  It is not that Canadians eschew a studious environment, they just want to be around their own kind.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That Asian students work harder is a fact born out by hard data. They tend to be strivers, high achievers and single-minded in their approach to university&#8221;.</p>
<p>What a coincidence, Asians work harder in school while black students and adults are more likely to work harder and be more single minded when it comes to activities like lifting weights? </p>

<p>&#8216;Meritocracy&rsquo; is great for whites but something tells me these same universities in Canada don&rsquo;t believe in meritocracy one bit when it comes to black, first nation, and &#8216;other&rsquo; students. I&rsquo;m guessing a few years ago they weren&rsquo;t so big on meritocracy when it came to recruiting female students, and when it comes to female job applicants, in certain jobs, today. </p>
<p>The only thing that would be more fitting would be for universities to be obsessed with blaming Asians and Asian wickedness for the policies that discriminate against them and keep them out, when they start discriminating against them, that is.  </p>

The fact that the children of Asian immigrants, many of them desperately poor, tend to do well academically, means that the black alibi of &#8220;white racism,&#8221; is invalid.  The children of those poor Asian immigrants also have a low crime rate.  They are too busy doing their homework to get into trouble with the law and have illegitimate children. </p>

		<p>So:  Asians will get their meritocracy and NAMs their diversity quotas   &mdash;   and whites will get screwed, but not (most) Jewish &#8220;whites&#8221; since they have their well tuned ethnic network and not (most) SWPLs, because they voice the proper lines.   </p>

&#8220;Diversity&#8221; and &#8220;inclusion&#8221; mean &#8220;taking from those who deserve a benefit and giving it to those who do not.&#8221; Asians earn the right to live and work with whites. Blacks frequently do not. <br/>

I was Reading a Similar Article in the National Post<br/>
by a South Asian. He was comparing this present situation<br/>
to that of the Jews several Generations ago being<br/>
blocked from Ivy League Schools. As if the numbers<br/>
of Jews compares to that of Asians? The author was<br/>
spitting out the WASP word. We are just a bunch of<br/>
WASPs being the &#8220;gate keepers&#8221;. We still Dominate the<br/>
Corridors of power, and on He went. He ignored the fact<br/>
that all European Whites get lumped in with the Anglos.<br/>
And, that it isn&rsquo;t just Whites being underrepresented<br/>
in Universities.<br/>
It was a fairly disturbing Article.</p>

		<p>In historical origin, the notion of a &#8220;university&#8221; is consonant<br/>
with a focus in Christendom upon personal  salvation and the integrity basic to it.  An ad hoc book, TRUTH ON TRIAL,  by a catholic publisher in Colorado details the fate of a Humanities<br/>
Program at the University of Kansas, under the inspiration of Franklyn Nelick, Dennis Quinn, John Senior and others.  The contemporary &#8220;university&#8221; is a sarcasm. It is a feverish devotion<br/>
to &#8220;disintegrity&#8221; and to skill without wisdom. As such, it certainly is fair seed bed  to invasion and dispossession.  The KU Humanities Program emphasized very basically the distinction between (a) a heretic as someone who had mastered tradition and chosen to reject it to a significant degree and (b) a barbarian, who had never adequately incorporated the wisdom of the past before embracing the passions of the present.   Basic.</p>

<p>They do collide! Always have and always should. I&rsquo;m a white guy who believes in meritocracy and that there should be no consideration of race for University entrance even if the Asian student body percentages dominates. I don&rsquo;t see how the Asians, who don&rsquo;t have the stupid guilt feelings of sucker whites, can tolerate all this anti-non-&#8220;minority&#8221; discrimination for politically correct &#8220;diversity&#8221; that cheats them. They should fight it.</p>

<p><i>How can universities be both meritocratic and &ldquo;diverse&rdquo;?</i></p>
<p><br/>
Oooh, teacher, teacher, pick me, pick me! I know the answer to that one! </p>
<p><i>They can&rsquo;t.</i> </p>
<p>That being the case, let&rsquo;s make our universities once again STRICTLY meritocratic   &mdash;   like universities were MEANT to be ever since universities began   &mdash;   and let the &#8220;diversity&#8221; (or lack thereof) fall where it may. </p>
<p>Anything else is no better than a butcher leaving his thumb on the scales while he weighs your purchase   &mdash;   IOW, cheating. </p>

		<p>Some salient points:</p>
<p>1.  The Asians are generally going into the &#8216;hard&rsquo; sciences and not into the humanities (history, philosophy, psychology, etc)  This means they will be drunken workaholics like their forbears in Asia.</p>
<p>2.  I am so tired of this myth of the Asian super student.  Did you know that most Asians are NOT so smart.  Go to any Chinatown area and you will see tons of just regular Asians, carrying boxes, cutting up fish, etc.  They&rsquo;re not all engineers and doctors.  I knew several Chinese people growing up.  They were nice people in general, but none of them were geniuses. Also, I&rsquo;ve see SO MANY teenage Asian cut ups in my neighborhood (smoking, yelling like idiots, acting the fool) that its annoying.</p>
<p>3.  Notice how the Left has dropped Asians and treats them like &#8216;privileged&rsquo; whites, even though many of them do work hard and mostly stay out of trouble.  This is why Asians and whites have more interests in common than the black and latino (fractious) coalition.  Leftists are giving us allies in the coming struggle.</p>
