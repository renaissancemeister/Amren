			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ula Ilnytzky, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shannon Tavarez, the 11-year-old who starred on Broadway in &#8220;The Lion King&#8221; and whose battle with leukemia won the hearts of many, including Alicia Keys, Rihanna and 50 Cent, has died.</p>
<p>Shannon died Monday afternoon at Cohen Children&rsquo;s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, on Long Island, of acute myelogenous leukemia, a common type of leukemia among adults, but rare among children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shannon, who played the young lion Nala, had received an umbilical-cord blood transplant in August. The procedure was performed as an alternative to a bone marrow transplant. Her doctor, Dr. Larry Wolfe, said that a perfect bone marrow match for Shannon could not be found.</p>
<p>The search for a match was especially daunting because Shannon&rsquo;s mother is African-American and her father is Hispanic, from the Dominican Republic. For bone marrow transplants, minorities and those of mixed ancestry have a more difficult time finding good matches because there aren&rsquo;t as many people from those groups signed up as potential donors. Right now, 83 percent of African-American patients who need marrow transplants don&rsquo;t find matches after six months of searching, according to the National Marrow Donor Program, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping patients receive transplants.</p>

		<p>I am a three-gallon blood donor.</p>
<p>I finally stopped giving after I figured out where most of it was going.</p>
<p>If a White person needs my blood, I make a donation in his name.</p>
<p>I just go not go in and randomly give anymore.</p>
<p>My blood is for my people  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t really care too much if other races (but I have some Oriental friends that I do care about and to whom I would give blood) get blood or even have abortions.</p>
<p>It is none of my business.</p>

		<p>Nonwhites NEVER contribute anything. They are quick to become the recipients though. That goes for blood, organs, giving to charity, contributing their fair share of taxes, join any organization that helps others, and the list goes on. This is one reason I do not give to charities any longer. Almost all is geared for nonwhites and for nonwhite nations. I can remember growing up and seeing the Elks Lodge, The Moose Lodge, and all the other organizations that Whites belonged to. Now you no longer have many of these organizations due to the declining White race and the growing minority races. </p>

		<p>This tragedy puts a spotlight on two uncomfortable realities:</p>
<p>1) People of mixed-race backgrounds, due to their atypical genetic profiles, have a much harder time finding matching bone marrow donors than people of single race backgrounds.</p>
<p>https://www.nowpublic.com/health/finding-bone-marrow-donors-problem-mixed-race-patients</p>
<p>&#8220;Nick Glasgow is sufferring from leukemia and he has not been able to find a donor yet because he is one-quarter Japanese. If  he were white, he would have a nearly 90 percent chance of finding a matching bone marrow donor who could cure his leukemia.&#8221;</p>
<p>2) Blacks and people with black ancestry seem to be very slow in helping out their &#8216;brothers and sisters&rsquo;.  As they say in the ghetto: &#8220;They talk the talk but they don&rsquo;t walk the walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess they figure Whitey will take care of this, like he does everything else.</p>

		<p>Sad but usually true, Blacks don&rsquo;t take care of their own families, let alone someone else&rsquo;s. Donate blood? Give of your time and effort? For free? A good follow up would be how many non-whites donate organs like kidneys for the benefit of others. It&rsquo;s easy to guess the answer to that one, almost none. </p>

		<p>This is because they are all alpha to a fault.  Accepting &#8220;white&#8221; technology with its ability to save and extend lives is against their primary objective, which is to prove whitey is bad.  This is just another example of &#8220;bruthas don&rsquo;t tip&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t anyone find the appearance of this article on amren a bit shameful? A 11-year old child has just DIED, and her passing is used as an opportunity to further your political aims. It&rsquo;s no different to the blacks in SA who used the death of Eugene Terreblanche in the same manner, except of course this child never beat a man half to death.</p>
<p>I hope you can join me in hoping that this young child has gone to a better place.</p>
<p>On a side-note to this tragic story: This from ABC news:</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 8,000 people from around the country, including the rapper 50 Cent, volunteered to be bone marrow donors in her name, but no match ever was found.&#8221;<br>
There was no shortage of donors here. It was simply very hard to find a match for Shannon, who was mixed race.</p>
<p>The fact that this story is subtitled &#8220;Non-whites rarely sign up as potential blood donors.&#8221; isn&rsquo;t technically right either. There&rsquo;s never been a shortage of blood in the United States, and all races do contribute to the pool. This article deals with bone marrow, a whole different thing. The ideal donor in such cases is a sibling, but unfortunately Shannon had no brothers or sisters.</p>

What is tragic is that medical science refuses to study the physical benefits or pitfalls of race mixing. Then again all the pitfalls would be blamed on racism. But if you are in the medical field you know that race makes a difference.</p>

<p>Gosh, you missed the whole point big time!</p>
<p>1) Blacks and Hispanics do not donate blood on a level equal to their percentage in the population.</p>
<p>2) Whites ARE more altruistic than any other race.  Why do you think Africa&rsquo;s population soares during periods of starvation, we feed them!</p>
<p>3) Mixed race people are harder to find a genetic match for.  Perhaps if Dominicans (who are a largely mixed population) and blacks donated blood, etc. a genetic match could have been found.  Trying to find a genetic match for a mostly black mulatto among whites wasn&rsquo;t gonna happen.</p>
<p>No one is glad this little girl passed but the article does show just how detrimental mixed race societies and people are to the common good.  Perhaps this isn&rsquo;t the forum for someone with your level of understanding.</p>

		<p>Yes, End to Illusion, an 11 year-old kid has died of a treatable disease, and the respondants on this thread have basically said it is not their problem.  </p>
<p>Consider, though, that the majority of blacks in the New York area - which includes a huge number of Afro-Caribbeans - also decided that it was not their problem and in spite of the publicity attached to this case decided, on their own, that they didn&rsquo;t want to get tested as a possible match.  As you mentioned, only 8000 blacks from the entire US could be bothered, but what you did not mention is that there are 40 million of them.  If 39,992,000 US blacks were entitled to decide this was not their problem, then I too am allowed this priviledge.  Additionally, when it comes to mixed-race people being tougher matches, I can put the ball back in the other court.  In spite of a growing number of mixed-race happas, mulattos, zambos and mestizos in the US, how many of them get tested as potential donors?</p>

<p>Your whole post leaves alot to be desired. You sit and chastise us for &#8220;furthering our political aims&#8221;?  Sorry, I have not much sympathy for interracial PARENTS who have children. As for you feeling sorry that Shannon had no mixed race siblings to be a donor, I find that amusing that you would even want MORE bi-racial kids so they can be donors? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that this child died in this way, leukemia is a cruel destroyer of both the young and old. My own family lost a child at a young age to this dreadful disease. However, she was one of many who died because no compatible donor could be found, many people of exclusively white, African or whatever ancestry have also died for the same reason. The fact is, persons of mixed ancestry really are risking coming down with conditions that cannot be treated just because their parents are not of the same race.</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s tragic that this child has died and everyone here, myself included, agrees and yes  I hope she&rsquo;s in a better place. However, the fact is that people of mixed race do have a much harder time finding bone marrow. If this little girl&rsquo;s parents had not race mixed, she likely could have found a donor and survived. The media and such pushes race mixing but never brings up these issues. I think these issues need to be brought up as its&rsquo;  possible your future child&rsquo;s life could depend on it.</p>

		<p>Poster 9: I think I clearly stated in my post that being mixed race in this case was a problem. race does make a biological difference, as all members of your race are more closely related to you than a member of another race.</p>
<p>Poster 10: I agree with number 1) and 3). 2) has some merit too, but Whites didn&rsquo;t rule the world by being altruistic.</p>
<p>Poster 11: 8000 people volunteered for this case. I believe there would have been a general additional pool that was also unacceptable. This is, of course is marrow donation, not blood, and like organs, marrow is in painfully short supply. As I said the donor in such cases is usually a close relative or even the patient him/herself if other parts of their marrow are healthy.</p>
<p>Poster 12: I chastise you not for &#8220;furthering your political aims&#8221;. That would be a misconstruing of my words. Rather I do so for the fact that you would use the death of a young girl to do so. And if you don&rsquo;t feel sorry for the parents, at least try and have some sympathy for the child.</p>

As one commenter noted, a likely reason is their fear that a DNA sample will be sent to the police, and that DNA will tie them to the unsolved crimes they&rsquo;ve committed. The same fear would hold for any other tissue donation.</p>

<p>How interesting you didn&rsquo;t break down those 8,000 by race.  I&rsquo;m willing to wager more than a few of them were White.</p>
<p>Keep believing your Afrocentrist fantasy that blacks and mixed-race peoples are just as likely to donate blood and bone marrow as Whites.  Medical professionals keep saying otherwise.  From the lead article:</p>
<p>&#8220;For bone marrow transplants, minorities and those of mixed ancestry have a more difficult time finding good matches because there aren&rsquo;t as many people from those groups signed up as potential donors.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I said earlier, you people want Whitey to do everything for you.</p>

		<p>I was recently diagnosed with MDS and my only hope for having a chance to survive was finding a donor. I come from a complete mixed background and my biggest fear was not finding a match. I am mother of 2 kids and my biggest concern was leaving them behind and it still is. I am grateful to God as I was lucky enough to find 3 potential donors. I realized that awareness is needed about becoming a donor and unfortunately this child died without having a second chance. Please consider becoming a donor.

<p>Well said and I sincerely hope you find a suitable donor soon. I am East-Indian and I&rsquo;m glad to donate my bone marrow to help unfortunate victims  of these truly debilitating conditions, irrespective of the recipients race. Unfortunately, there are people on this forum who take malicious pleasure in other peoples misfortunes  simply because the unfortunate belong to another race.</p>

		<p>We are all here on earth to help each other no matter what our back ground, white, black or purple. When I was first diagnosed I cried a lot but it never crossed my mind to wish such a terrible disease on anyone else. It is sad that others get pleasure when they see others suffering. Now that I am in  this situation I wish every one could find the help that I got. Our job here on earth is to help other if we can, no matter what the situation is. Please put all ill  wishes on the side and just place your self in the position of the person looking for a donor and the desperation they might be feeling. Please consider becoming a donor visit marrow.org and do some more research. You will be compensated at some other point in your life. </p>

		<p>I think Amren should stop posting such stories out of respect for the victims, not to mention for reasons of sheer human decency. The gleeful tones that surround stories of non-white/mixed race suffering comes across as petty and diminishes the credibility of White Nationalists in the eyes of the broader public. Taking malicious delight in other peoples&rsquo; suffering is mean-spirited and uncultured; a poor reflection of moral compass and human character.</p>
