<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
        <p> <span class="dropcap">O</span>ver the past three years, the media
have been covering an ongoing class-action lawsuit against the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) by black farmers. According to the
press, the department has admitted discriminating for years against
thousands of honest black farmers, and is now paying the price. To
date, no press report has fully explained the lawsuit and the way it
was settled. This means no press report has told the truth about what
amounts to a deliberate decision by USDA to write checks to virtually
any black who steps forward with a claim of &#8220;racism.&#8221; This article,
relying exclusively on knowledgeable sources within the government, is
the first in-depth look at this sad affair, which is likely to cost
taxpayers at least $2 billion and perhaps as much as $4 billion. The
story is an involved one but is sadly instructive of the self-abasement
now common in the name of race. It likewise provides blacks yet more
encouragement in their belief that they are beset by bigotry at every
turn.<br/><br/>The story began simply enough in December 1996,
when a small group of black farmers demonstrated in front of the White
House, complaining about alleged USDA discrimination in its vast farm
lending program. Blacks are less than one percent of the farming
population but account for three times that proportion of USDA lending
(3.2 percent), which suggests the very opposite of deliberate
exclusion, but no one pointed this out at the time. The press gave the
demonstration more coverage than its small numbers and unsubstantiated
claims merited, and shortly afterwards, according to sources within the
government, William Clinton told Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to
keep complaining blacks &#8220;out of my back yard.&#8221; Mr. Glickman, who had
been given a cabinet post by Mr. Clinton after being ousted in the 1994
Republican landslide from a House seat he had held for 18 years, was
quick to comply. </p>
        <table class="quoteleft">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th>USDA essentially decided to write a check to virtually any black who stepped forward with a claim of &#8220;racism.&#8221;</th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
Within days, Mr. Glickman announced the sudden discovery of rampant
discrimination within the department he had headed for nearly two years
(and which had been run before him by a black former congressman, Mike
Espy). He offered no evidence of racism, but scheduled a series of
&#8220;listening sessions&#8221; around the country to look for some. </p>
        <p>
At a probable cost of a million dollars or more, the January 1997, USDA
&#8220;listening&#8221; tour made stops in 11 cities from California to Washington,
D.C. The entourage included Mr. Glickman&rsquo;s deputy secretary, the black
leader of a newly created Civil Rights Action Team (CRAT), and a
hand-picked group of 11 other government officials. The CRAT had
originally numbered ten, but an eleventh was hurriedly added when it
was discovered Mr. Glickman had forgotten to include a Hispanic. </p>
        <p>
The &#8220;listening&#8221; tour had much to listen to (see sidebar on page 3).
Plenty of people, many of whom had been complaining for decades about
alleged USDA racism, were happy to repeat well-practiced accounts of
mistreatment. Among the aggrieved was a small group of black farmers
whose attempt to file a class-action suit had been dismissed a few
years earlier. They did not claim USDA had refused them money   &mdash;   all had
received farm loans   &mdash;   but that white bureaucrats had not done enough to
help make them successful farmers. </p>
        <p> After hearing a
variety of accusations, Mr. Glickman&rsquo;s CRAT concluded that USDA&rsquo;s civil
rights apparatus had not been doing its job. It blamed the Reagan
Administration for this, although Democrats had been in charge for the
preceding five years. The CRAT declared that the Civil Rights Division
was in a &#8220;persistent state of chaos,&#8221; largely because of constant
&#8220;reorganization&#8221; (which usually resulted in higher pay for the
mostly-black staff). CRAT also discovered that the general impression
of the Civil Rights Division was true: It was a &#8220;dumping ground&#8221; for
obstreperous or unproductive employees who were transferred there to
undemanding jobs, as a way of resolving conflicts with previous
supervisors. </p>
        <p> Needless to say, CRAT also found that
lax supervision by the civil rights division had permitted racism to
run riot through the department, and Mr. Glickman accepted all CRAT
recommendations on how to correct this. As part of this process, he
ordered an immediate review of 956 backlogged discrimination
complaints. The department paid millions of dollars to bring field
office workers to Washington to review these complaints, with the
result that <i>possible </i>discrimination was found to have occurred in only <i>five </i>of 956 cases. </p>
        <p>
The department suppressed these inconvenient findings. After these
employees had spent months poring over case files a Glickman assistant
condemned them to their faces as liars intent on covering up the
misdeeds of fellow employees. He also told them to destroy their notes.
</p>
        <p> <b>Let&rsquo;s Make a Deal</b> </p>
        <p> There had to be a better solution, and Mr. Glickman set out to find it. In 1995, five USDA borrowers had filed a lawsuit (<i>Williams v. Glickman</i>)
charging discrimination against black and Hispanic farmers. District of
Columbia Judge Thomas Flannery denied class-action status, citing the
amorphous nature of the proposed class and noting that the claims of
the named plaintiffs were not representative of the claims of potential
class members. </p>
        <p> However, with the legal climate
improved by Mr. Glickman charging his own employees with bigotry, two
black farmers in North Carolina filed separate but similar suits in
1997, this time on behalf of blacks only. One plaintiff was Timothy
Pigford and the other was Cecil Brewington. The Pigford suit is
particularly notable because USDA had investigated his claims at least
three times and found no discrimination. </p>
        <p> What&rsquo;s more, a previous suit by Mr. Pigford against USDA had been dismissed <i>with prejudice,</i>
which means he should not have been allowed to file another suit making
the same charges. Both he and Mr. Brewington enlisted high-powered
professional civil rights lawyers who recruited hundreds of plaintiffs.
At least partly because USDA refused to challenge Mr. Pigford&rsquo;s right
to sue, and made only token defenses, the cases became a legal
juggernaut. </p>
        <table class="quoteright">
          <tbody><tr>

        </tbody></table>
        <p>
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, a Clinton appointee, got both cases.
Judge Friedman often presided over sensitive Clinton-related cases,
which he appears to have received outside the normal assignment
process. His cases included those of Chinese bagman Charlie Trie,
Democrat fundraiser Pauline Kanchanalak, and Maria Hsia of the
notorious Buddhist temple fundraiser. In each case, Judge Friedman
dismissed the charges against Mr. Clinton&rsquo;s associates, and in each
case, a higher court promptly reinstated the charges, leading to the
suspicion that Judge Friedman might be answering to a higher authority
than mere law. (Judge Friedman also got the slander suit filed by White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal against Internet reporter Matt Drudge.
Under Judge Friedman&rsquo;s supervision, that case has dragged on for years,
sapping Mr. Drudge&rsquo;s finances and energy. No trial date is set.) </p>
        <p> Judge Friedman combined the cases and they are today known as <i>Pigford v. Glickman. </i>Amazingly, the complaint cites <i>absolutely no evidence of discrimination </i>by
USDA other than Mr. Glickman&rsquo;s statement that discrimination was
rampant in his department. Judge Friedman certified class-action status
for the suit in October, 1998, and juggernaut was ready to launch. </p>
        <p>
There was just one obstacle: the federal statute of limitations on
discrimination complaints is two years from the date of discrimination,
and had already expired for almost all the complainants. The
Congressional Black Caucus came to the rescue and drafted legislation
waiving the statute of limitations. Heretofore, all such waivers
extended the deadline before the original statute of limitations had
expired. Some would argue that a waiver <i>after </i>expiration is an unconstitutional <i>ex post facto </i>law, because it recriminalizes an action after the statute of limitations has decriminalized it. </p>
        <p>
Nevertheless, the waiver was added as an amendment to the Agriculture
appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999, and authorized consideration
of discrimination claims from January 1, 1981, through December 31,
1996. Republicans happily helped pass the bill. Had USDA raised the
Constitutional question, it is possible the entire suit could have been
derailed, but it was clearly Mr. Glickman&rsquo;s wish to cooperate with the
plaintiffs rather than defend his department. </p>
        <p> In
April, 1999, the government and the plaintiffs entered into a consent
decree approved by Judge Friedman (the text of the decree and other
related information is available on the Internet.
Although the department accepted no blame, the document was hailed in
the press as an admission of wrongdoing by USDA. The consent decree set
up a two-stage process for securing compensation for alleged acts of
racism. The first was to join the class of claimants and the second was
to demonstrate USDA bias. The criteria for both were so lenient they
were hardly obstacles to anyone determined to join the class and
receive a payment. </p>
        <p> In order to join, a claimant must
be black and (1) have &#8220;farmed or attempted to farm between January 1,
1981, and December 31, 1996,&#8221; (2) have applied to USDA for a loan or
crop payment and believe that application was denied because of race,
and (3) have &#8220;filed a discrimination complaint on or before July 1,
1997, regarding USDA&rsquo;s treatment of such farm credit or benefit
application.&#8221; These sound like reasonable criteria but in practice none
is a real obstacle. For example, no claimant need ever have set foot on
a farm   &mdash;   a claim to have applied unsuccessfully for a loan qualifies as
having &#8220;attempted to farm.&#8221; Nor is any claimant required to <i>prove </i>he actually applied for any USDA benefit. He need only say he did. </p>
        <p>
The third condition   &mdash;   that a claimant show he detected discrimination
at the time of the loan application and filed a complaint   &mdash;   has been
watered down to essentially nothing. The claimant need only
&#8220;demonstrate&#8221; that he &#8220;has actively pursued judicial remedies&#8221; (this
violates the federal requirement that all administrative remedies must
be exhausted before taking judicial action), &#8220;was induced or tricked by
USDA&rsquo;s misconduct&#8221; into missing the filing deadline, or &#8220;was prevented
by other extraordinary circumstances beyond his control&#8221; from filing a
complaint on time. And once again, the &#8220;proof&#8221; required of a claimant
that he actually &#8220;pursued judicial remedies&#8221; for discrimination is
laughable. If he can&rsquo;t show a copy of a complaint and there are no USDA
documents that refer to a complaint   &mdash;   which is the case for the vast
majority of claimants   &mdash;   the court will accept any of the following: </p>
        <ol><li>
A declaration from a non-family member that the claimant filed a
discrimination complaint with USDA. (No corroboration from USDA is
required, and it is not likely to be difficult to find someone to make
such a declaration.) </li><li> A declaration by a
non-family member with &#8220;first-hand knowledge that, while attending a
USDA listening session, or other meeting with a USDA official or
officials, the claimant was specifically told by a USDA official that
the official would investigate the specific claimants oral complaint of
discrimination.&#8221; (In other words, someone need only say that he heard
the claimant accuse USDA of discrimination and heard a USDA official
say the department would look into it. Even USDA admits &#8220;there is no
mechanism to assess credibility&#8221; of such a claim.) </li><li>
A copy of correspondence to Congress, the White House, or a local or
federal official &#8220;averring that the claimant has been discriminated
against.&#8221; (There need be no corroboration or acknowledgment from any of
these officials. The claimant need only affirm that he mailed the
letter of which he has a copy, and there are no standards for judging
the authenticity of such a copy.) </li></ol>
        <p> As a
practical matter, therefore, anyone who feels like writing a back-dated
letter or can persuade someone to lie can be a member of the class. The
only genuinely limiting qualification for class membership is that the
claimant be black. What is more, under the consent decree, the
statement of any complainant is accepted as true <i>unless USDA can refute it</i> with documentation, but the department&rsquo;s document retention policies <i>make it impossible to refute most claims.</i>
It keeps records of unsuccessful loan applications for only three
years, so there is no paper trail for applications made any earlier
than 1994   &mdash;   especially for &#8220;farmers&#8221; who never applied for a loan at
all! Therefore, <i>the government knew when it consented to the decree
that it could not disprove any claim concerning a loan allegedly denied
between 1981 and 1994.</i> Even the most obviously fraudulent claimant is accepted by default if he says he was turned down for a loan before 1994. </p>
        <p>
Any class of plaintiffs that is easy to join and that promises a
handsome payoff is going to find a lot of takers. As soon as Judge
Friedman approved the consent decree, the class attorneys started
promoting it, promising that any black who joined the class had a good
chance of getting $50,000. To publicize the terms of the decree, USDA
had to spend nearly half a million dollars on advertisements on Black
Entertainment Television and Cable News Network, in <i>TV Guide,</i> <i>Jet</i>
magazine, and 27 general circulation newspapers and 115 black-owned
papers. This widely-publicized offer of $50,000 set off something like
the Oklahoma land rush. </p>

        <p>
When the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorneys first sought to have the case certified
as a class action, they estimated perhaps 2,500 people would file
claims. By the decree&rsquo;s official closing date of October, 1999, over
20,000 had joined the suit   &mdash;   more than the total number of black
farmers in the United States (18,451 according to the 1997 Census of
Agriculture). This number, representing a potential liability of at
least $1 billion (not counting debt forgiveness, &#8220;Track B&#8221; cases
explained below, and heavy expenses to be paid by the government) was
not enough for Judge Friedman. He let hundreds apply after the closing
date. Today, more than a year after the &#8220;deadline,&#8221; the final number of
claimants cannot be determined because these &#8220;bonus&#8221; claimants are
still being certified, but as of Dec. 21, 2000, 21,105 blacks had been
accepted as members of the class. Judge Friedman is now considering
loosening the deadline once again, in a procedure that could bring in
as many as <i>50,000 </i>new claimants. </p>
        <p> A private
firm, Poorman-Douglas of Portland, Oregon, was hired to mail out claim
packages, receive claims, and process them. Fraud surfaced immediately.
Some prospective claimants tried to have children as young as two years
old certified as class members. A few whites tried to &#8220;pass,&#8221; but were
rooted out. Husbands and wives, who may have applied for one loan,
tried to get separate certification, hoping to be paid twice for a
single act of discrimination. A number of dead people have joined the
suit, since USDA agreed to let surviving relatives argue on their
behalf. </p>
        <p> For claimants who have actually done business
with USDA there are immediate benefits simply to joining the class. The
department must stop all efforts to foreclose on their delinquent
loans. Also, if the government owns property it obtained in foreclosure
on a claimant, it must not sell the land but must hold it until the
claim is decided. If the claimant wins he gets the property back free
and clear, even if there was not the slightest hint of discrimination
in the proceedings that led to the foreclosure. </p>
        <p> In
practice, the suit has become an across-the-board ban on foreclosure of
black delinquent borrowers because they are all potential parties to
the suit. As might be expected, defaults have soared. USDA regularly
calculates the percentage of borrowers of each race that are
delinquent, and in late 2000, the rate for blacks was 36 percent as
opposed to a white rate of 14 percent. In the forgiving atmosphere
created by the Pigford case, the black delinquency rate has been as
high as 48 percent. </p>
        <p> <b>Take the Money, Please</b> </p>
        <p>
Joining the class, however, does not automatically mean money. The
decree provides for two &#8220;tracks&#8221; for resolving complaints and
determining whether a payment is due. USDA rather candidly describes
Track A as &#8220;the easier, more streamlined track for class members who do
not have as much, <i>or any,</i> direct proof of discrimination.&#8221; [Italics added] </p>
        <p>
For those who choose Track A, a &#8220;contract adjudicator&#8221; decides the
case. Federal rules of evidence and other legal standards do not apply.
To win, a claimant need only give &#8220;substantial evidence,&#8221; the lowest
standard of proof required in any judicial proceeding, of the
following: </p>
        <ol><li> He &#8220;owned or leased, or attempted to own or lease, farm land.&#8221; </li><li> He &#8220;applied for a specific credit transaction at a USDA county office&#8221; during the specified period. </li><li>
The loan was &#8220;denied, provided late, approved for a lesser amount than
requested, encumbered by restrictive conditions, or USDA failed to
provide appropriate loan service, and such treatment was less favorable
than that accorded specifically identified similarly situated white
farmers.&#8221; </li><li>&#8220;USDA&rsquo;s treatment of the loan application led to economic damage to the class member.&#8221; </li></ol>
        <table class="boxright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="../../../../ar/2001/02/JUMPsmall.GIF" alt="" height="136" width="108"/></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
Once again, since USDA no longer has any records of loans denied before
1994, any claim from that period is virtually impossible to refute. If
a Track A claimant wins, he gets a flat $50,000, regardless of the form
the discrimination is alleged to have taken. If he is an actual USDA
borrower, and is claiming he got a loan on unfavorable terms because of
racial discrimination, he also gets complete loan forgiveness, plus 25
percent of this amount, which goes to the IRS for taxes. If the
government owns any foreclosed property that used to belong to a
successful claimant he gets it back. He also jumps to the head of the
line for consideration for future USDA loans, and for the purchase of
one farm property foreclosed upon by the government. </p>
        <p>
Track B is for people unwilling to settle for $50,000. All Track B
claimants are demanding millions and one ambitious farmer says it will
take no less than $70 million to make him whole. These cases are
decided by an arbitrator, Michael K. Lewis of ADR Associates, who is
black. Under his supervision, claimants must demonstrate discrimination
by a &#8220;preponderance of the evidence,&#8221; a somewhat higher standard of
proof than Track A. Track B cases involve rules of evidence, discovery,
witnesses, sworn testimony and other legalisms that will increase the
amount owed to class attorneys. Even if the government wins a Track B
case, the arbitrator receives a fee that can exceed $10,000 and is paid
from tax dollars. If a Track B claimant wins, he gets actual damages,
discharge of debt, return of property, and the same advantages in
future dealings with USDA as claimants in Track A. By Dec., 2000, only
about 196 (fewer than one percent) of the first 21,000 plaintiffs had
chosen this option, which actually requires some proof of
discrimination. </p>
        <p> By last December, 19,770 Track A
cases had been decided, and the government had won about 40 percent of
them. It has managed to win most of the cases in which the claimant was
actually a borrower, because the department keeps the complete case
file for the entire life of a loan (usually 30 years), and therefore
has all the necessary documentation to refute charges of
discrimination. It is highly significant that of the 11,932 claimants
who had won so far, there were actual records of USDA loans for only
1,140 or 9.5 percent of them. This means only a tiny minority of
successful claimants had some kind of documented borrowing relationship
with USDA. It is impossible to know what proportion of the other 90.5
percent ever had contact with the department at all, much less suffered
anything that could be described as discrimination. It is in these very
dubious circumstances that the department has paid out nearly half a
billion dollars in $50,000 payments (see sidebar, next page). </p>
        <p>
Of the 1,140 successful claimants who had actually borrowed money from
USDA, only 131 had loan balances that could be forgiven; most of the
rest had defaulted and the department had already taken losses on the
loans. This means USDA not only never got its money back, it had to
hand over another $50,000 because of alleged racism in the way the
loans were made. </p>
        <p> USDA has managed to win some of the
cases for which it does not even have documentation. This is a tribute
to a group of about 250 dedicated government workers who analyze the
unsubstantiated claims and are able to discredit some solely on the
basis of statements made by claimants. Some of these claims are
literally photocopies of each other, alleging discrimination in the
same manner, by the same USDA official in the same county office. When
it can be proven that the official was not working in that office at
the time, or if there are other obvious contradictions, the claim can
be denied. There appear to be no plans to prosecute claimants who
committed perjury by making false claims. </p>
        <p> Track B
cases take longer, so there have been fewer results. The record is
distinctly mixed. As of December 2000, only 14 of 196 cases had been
disposed of, with seven dismissed outright. Two had been settled, and
the arbitrator had issued five rulings, three in favor of the
complainant. If the settlements are counted as draws, the government
has won nine, lost three, and drawn two. The bigger cases are proving
more difficult to win, even against a department that has bent every
rule to make things easy for the complainants. </p>
        <p> Back
in the field, where USDA loans are still being made, some nonwhite
farmers have been quick to take advantage of the current &#8220;civil rights&#8221;
climate, openly threatening credit officers with legal action if they
don&rsquo;t get loans. Not coincidentally, the latest figures show an
increase in loans to nonwhites, and a corresponding drop in loans to
whites (because the total allocated by Congress remains the same.)
While many department employees are disgusted by this practice, they go
along with it because they know USDA never punishes anyone for making
loans that fail, but is desperate to find someone it can punish for
discrimination. Of course, when a doomed loan does go sour, this too
can tag the loan officer as a racist because he didn&rsquo;t support the
borrower and make him a success. </p>
        <p> The publicity
surrounding the thousands of payouts to black farmers has prompted a
flurry of imitators. Not content with $50,000, American Indians have
filed a similar suit, demanding $1 million each. Curiously, Judge
Friedman refused a motion that this suit be &#8220;piggybacked&#8221; on the
Pigford case, claiming there is not enough &#8220;similarity&#8221; in the cases.
In fact, the Indian case is a virtual carbon copy of the black case. </p>
        <p>
In October, 2000, a group of three Hispanics filed suit on behalf of an
alleged 20,000 of their brethren, making identical claims. Later that
month, just before the final expiration of the statute-of-limitations
waiver, Asian-Americans and women filed similar suits. At this point,
virtually every &#8220;protected&#8221; group except homosexuals and the
handicapped now alleges mistreatment by USDA. </p>

        <p> Even more remarkable is yet another lawsuit (<i>Green v. Glickman</i>)filed
on May 12, 2000, on behalf of &#8220;non-African-American&#8221; farmers (mostly
whites), which claims USDA treated them the same way it treated blacks.
Congressman Bennie Thompson (D-MS), who is black and an ardent partisan
of black causes says, &#8220;I can see little difference in the way black
farmers were treated in <i>Pigford</i> and what has happened to the
farmers in this suit,&#8221; adding, &#8220;I believe it has the potential to be
larger than the black farmers&rsquo; suit once word gets out.&#8221; Congressman
Thompson may not understand the significance of what he is saying: If
USDA treated all of its borrowers equally (badly), regardless of race,
then it didn&rsquo;t discriminate against anyone. If the congressman is
right, all the lawsuits are equally fraudulent. </p>
        <p> On
the other hand, for obvious reasons the Justice Department is very
serious about fighting the white claimants. U.S. Magistrate Alfred
Nicols has refused to accept amended claims that could add hundreds of
additional plaintiffs. The class is now frozen at approximately 100
claimants, and despite Congressman Thompson&rsquo;s enthusiasm for it, the
case is likely to be dismissed. </p>
        <p> The black case,
though, is typical of everything that is wrong about &#8220;discrimination&#8221;
lawsuits. Like most defendants, the department admitted no guilt, but
agreed to huge payouts because it is so time-consuming and expensive to
fight a discrimination case all the way to a &#8220;not guilty&#8221; verdict. In
this case, though, the department also <i>cooperated </i>with the
plaintiffs, making it ridiculously easy to take its money, rather than
mount the many defenses available to it. The larger effect, of course,
is to create and publicize yet another example of systemic &#8220;racial
discrimination.&#8221; Every black crank and agitator has yet another scalp
to nail to the wall, yet more proof that even the United States
government is seething with racism. </p>
        <p> Furthermore, as
in almost all major &#8220;discrimination&#8221; cases, the press has reported next
to nothing about the actual workings of the case or about what specific
wrongs were done the plaintiffs   &mdash;   only that thousands of blacks are
finally being compensated for years of discrimination. One reason for
the silence is that, as we have seen, the case is complicated. But
another is that close examination shows that virtually all the
&#8220;discrimination&#8221; for which blacks are being compensated amounts to
nothing more than pure assertion by claimants. USDA put itself in the
absurd position of agreeing to give money to thousands of blacks simply
because they say they deserve it. This is, in fact, a very juicy story
for an enterprising young reporter, but the media are vastly more
interested in trumpeting even dubious claims of discrimination than in
showing them to be false   &mdash;   even when falsehoods lead to huge drains on
the public purse. </p>
        <p> Was there discrimination against
black farmers? Perhaps there was. But Track A is hardly a procedure
that proves it. Track B, with its more formal rules of evidence may yet
uncover some kind of wrongdoing, but these proceedings are closed to
the public and their records are sealed. The public will probably never
know the basis for the million-dollar judgments that could ensue. </p>
        <p>
There is, however, a faint stirring of interest in the case in certain
quarters. In December, 2000, the General Accounting Office notified
USDA that at the request of Rep. Larry Combest (R-TX), chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee, it would be studying the Pigford case, as
well as the individual settlements agreed to by the department outside
the case. Something it is reportedly keen to understand is why so few
of the people who got $50,000 payments under the lawsuit appear to have
had any connection with American agriculture   &mdash;   a very good question. </p>
        <p>
There is other disturbing question about this case. When racists are
discovered they usually face quick and severe punishment, and there
have already been 11,932 official Track A findings of racial
discrimination. There must have been an awful lot of racists in the
department practicing a great deal of racism   &mdash;   aren&rsquo;t they going to be
brought to book? The black claimants and their lawyers keep pushing
this, insisting that heads must roll. Mr. Glickman obliged by
repeatedly threatening to fire or otherwise discipline the &#8220;racists,&#8221;
but this is mostly bluff. Any civil service or court action resulting
from such a dismissal could very well establish that there had been no
discrimination at all. On the other hand, most department employees
cannot afford the huge legal fees it would take to clear their names,
so the threat of retribution has created an atmosphere of quiet terror
in USDA. </p>
        <p> In fact, the department refuses to say whether or how many USDA employees have been disciplined in connection with <i>Pigford.</i>
It will certainly not divulge names, though it might be quite
interesting to hear what someone punished in this connection might have
to say. So for the time being a strange and troubling contradiction
hangs over this case: The department has compensated nearly 12,000
black farmers for what could only have been entrenched racism, but will
not confirm it has fired a single racist.<!-- #bbinclude "textend.incl" -->

		<p>Everytime I read such articles I have to look at my 7yr old and 12yr old and wonder if some years from now they will ask me what I did about this and the thousand other miseries exacted on us and passed on to them.  I have searched my mind and soul as to what can I do.  What I have done is pay out their future inheritance to afford them a decent, private school education, I vote against these crooks at each opportunity, I donate to the &#8220;right&#8221; causes, I voluteer to organizations that build our youth and I pray for the strength to continue to fight for their futures.  But it is stories like this that tell me we are slipping away, further away from the great country my parents handed to me, further away from a just society where ability and honesty are rewarded.  The last option that I have worked out in my mind is not one that I would lightly choose but one that seems more and more necessary.  Is it not our birthright at the very end of days to fight for what we had?  How long do we need to wait before it will be too late and not even at the last minute with our lives can we win back what was ours?</p>

		<p>For gods sake give them what they want hasn&rsquo;t the white man been hard enough on our poor black friends? Isn&rsquo;t it the white man himself who put all these idea&rsquo;s of equality and entitlement into their heads? Now the chicken has come home to roost. <br/>
Instead of saying what is true too many whites say what is politically correct and look what our country is becoming. It is very sad, very sad indeed.</p>

		<p>Within one year 80 % of that money will be gone in 80 % of the instances. Figure how long it will take for the lot to be &#8220;poor&#8221; again?</p>

		<p>Milton&hellip;.there is a difference between equality and entitlement.  Equality means that we are all equal. Nobody is better or worse.  Entitlement is something that is something that is expected. Our generation of people didn&rsquo;t participate in slavery.  I owe the black men and women of this country nothing expect the same respect that I feel I am entitled to.  Yours are the problem with this country right now. </p>
<p>I am all for equality.  I however am against entitlement by anyone that has an able body.</p>
