<h1>Reid Courts Hispanic Voters in Univision Appearance</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Stanton, Roll Call, October 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an interview on &#8220;Al Punto,&#8221; Univision&rsquo;s Sunday public affairs television show, the Nevada Democrat [Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid] said he would bring up the immigration legislation, known as the Dream Act, in the Senate&rsquo;s lame-duck session.</p>
<p>Reid also took aim at conservatives  &mdash;  including Sharron Angle, the Republican challenging him in the midterm elections for his Senate seat  &mdash;  when asked about ads urging Latinos in Nevada not to vote, arguing that they are racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;To think that she would never even denounce efforts made to tell Hispanics not to vote,&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;Anybody [who has seen the ads] says that they&rsquo;re racist in their nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reid also addressed the recent resignation of Diana Tejada, his press secretary for Hispanic media. She left Reid&rsquo;s staff last week after Fox News reported that she had entered into an illegal marriage to try to help a Lebanese man gain U.S. residency.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I learned about this situation with her, we conducted an investigation, and it appeared she did some things that were absolutely wrong,&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;And as a result of that, I felt it was appropriate that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I accept her resignation.&#8221;<br>

<p>Yes, most whites  &mdash;  especially us white conservatives  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t want blacks and hispanics to vote.  We don&rsquo;t want you to have any say in how we run our country and who we let in.  In fact, we don&rsquo;t like your presence here at all.  Does that seem clear to you?</p>

		<p>The media has really fallen down on Harry Reid. If he were a conservative, his relationships with shady characters in organized crime and the gaming industry would have driven him from politics a long time ago. Then again, Frank Sinatra was a big Democratic supporter and booster for the Kennedys. Well,Frank was a great entertainer; Harry has no offsetting talents.</p>

		<p>Nevada is currently 20% Hispanic. My bet is if Nevada were 50% Hispanic and the competitor for his Senate seat were Hispanic, he might hold a slightly different view of Dream Act type immigration legislation.  As usual though, our politicians are sacrificing the long term viability of our nation for their own temporary personal gain.</p>

One word: desperate.</p>
<p>There have been reports that ballots have been filled out with Reids name checked off already. Auditors have said these were anomalies.</p>
<p>As with Ted Kennedy, Reid seems to always have the election in his pocket and these elections seem to be little more than formalities.</p>
<p>Can anyone from Devada share their insight into why Nevada voters vote the way they do?</p>

		<p>Reid calls Angle a racist. Wonder what he would do if she called him a traitor? And which one would be correct?</p>

		<p>Once the people of this country reject Reid, maybe he can run for president of Mexico where the people there will accept him with open arms.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s all join in prayer that the whites show up at the polls and others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And when this election is over, perhaps we should further pray that we can reinstate the voting process to be as it was set out by the Founding Fathers - to consist of white men who own land, period.  Fat chance of that.  But maybe we can get tests reinstated so at least voters have to show some level of intelligence.</p>
<p>How did we ever get ourselves into this situation - liberalism (a little at a time).  The country is going down the tubes folks.</p>

		<p>Talk about pandering!  Reid knows that the Dream Act will go nowhere in the lame duck, yet he promises Hispanics he will &#8220;bring it up&#8221;!  In other words, he&rsquo;ll throw them a sop just like he did just before the campaign break.  He must believe that every Hispanic in Nevada is utterly, profoundly stupid.</p>

		<p>For all the naysayers that say voting doesn&rsquo;t matter, I present the case that white America will do much better without a sell-out like Harry Reid in office. Even a slimy RINO or NeoCon would pander and grovel less to La Raza, and Sharon Angle is at least talkin&rsquo; the talk right now. You can tell her campaign ad is awesome because it makes liberal commentators heads explode. They call it racist yet never refute any of the information that is supposedly so inaccurate.      </p>

		<p>It looks like Reid has one.  The Democrats got enough illegal immigrants to vote to swing the election.<br>
