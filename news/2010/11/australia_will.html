			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Allard, Brisbane Times, November 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Australia will spend $500 million building 2000 schools in Indonesia in an effort to improve the prospects of Indonesia&rsquo;s youth and moderate the influence of the country&rsquo;s religious schools.</p>
<p>The five-year initiative was announced yesterday at a joint press conference by Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her Indonesian counterpart Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. A commitment to forge a broader economic relationship was endorsed, and people-smuggling and the fate of Schapelle Corby and the Bali nine were also discussed.</p>
<p>After Dr Yudhoyono urged Australia not to &#8220;pressure&#8221; it after a video showing Indonesian soldiers torturing Papuans became public, Ms Gillard did raise the issue but only to praise the Indonesians for bringing the soldiers to trial.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard has frequently expressed her passion for education, saying it trumped her interests in foreign affairs. In Jakarta yesterday, she combined the two as she announced the $500 million package for Indonesia&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;My firm belief is that the future of our two countries will be determined largely by what is happening in the schools of each of our nations today,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The program to build 2000 new schools  &mdash;  providing places for more than 300,000 junior secondary school students  &mdash;  and upgrade the curriculum of another 1500 Islamic schools builds on a successful program already being run by AusAID. Australia has already funded the construction of 2000 primary level schools.</p>
<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s Islamic schools are largely moderate in outlook but there have been pockets of radicalism that have produced terrorists in Indonesia, most notably the cleric Abu Bakar Bashir&rsquo;s school in Ngruki, central Java, where some of the Bali bombers studied.</p>
<p>The Islamic schools have been poorly regulated and the standard of education has been low.</p>
<p>By paying for 1500 madrasah, as the schools are also known, to adopt Indonesia&rsquo;s national curriculum, students will receive a more traditional education in the sciences, history and humanities and not focus so heavily on studying the Koran.</p>
<p>The two countries also announced the commencement of negotiations for a &#8220;comprehensive economic partnership&#8221;, which aims to go beyond a traditional free trade agreement and build a &#8220;higher level and mutually beneficial economic partnership&#8221;.</p>
<p>The economic ties between the countries  &mdash;  while growing  &mdash;  have lagged behind other aspects of the relationship.</p>
<p>Diplomats said that while the agreement went beyond a traditional free trade agreement, negotiations could be tricky as Indonesia still has strong protectionist instincts.</p>
<p>As for the fate of the Australian drug smugglers imprisoned in Indonesia, Dr Yudhoyono gave little indication of whether he would grant Corby&rsquo;s appeal to him for clemency.</p>
<p>However, he did say he was &#8220;optimistic&#8221; a prisoner transfer deal that would potentially see Corby and others serve their terms in Australia could be negotiated.</p>
<p>Such a deal has been negotiated on and off for five years and gone nowhere.</p>
<p>While Dr Yudhoyono gave it presidential endorsement, there is little prospect that the required enabling legislation could get through Indonesia&rsquo;s notoriously work-shy and fractious Parliament.</p>
<p>Dr Yudhoyono backed away from endorsing Ms Gillard&rsquo;s proposed refugee processing centre. He was &#8220;open&#8221; to the idea &#8220;but we need to discuss in depth to ensure, once again, this is a solution to our regional problem&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Government actions like that are infuriating not only because they are a crime against their own citizens and taxpayers but because they invariably end up making the situation worse. It&rsquo;s a foolish waste of money.</p>

		<p>Indonesia has been independent since 1947. It received billions from China, the former USSR, and then from the US. Indonesia is an oil producer and an outspoken member of international Muslim groups.  It can&rsquo;t build its own schools? And if the people there want religious schools, why would they go to a school built by infidel Australians? The basketball courts? </p>
<p>And how after the checks are cut, do the Aussies know what is taught in those schools? The Aussies supplying teachers? Female teachers in Western garb? </p>
<p>Decades of Western involvement in the Middle East did not prevent the Islamist Renaissance. These people are different than we are.  Their view of education is utterly different from ours. Another waste of money.</p>

		<p>The Australian government(or any government) should be spending its&rsquo; money on the needs of its&rsquo; own citizens, not on foreigners. Governments don&rsquo;t seem to realize that they have NO right to give away tax dollars, hard earned by the citizens, to other nations, its&rsquo; NOT the government&rsquo;s money to give.</p>

<p>I suspect Indonesia is the leading cause of why there is some much plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean. California and the US might not be far behind if we have greater immigration. But of course, it&rsquo;s racist and insensitive to tell the truth. Even if it is an environmentally friendly truth. But hey, I&rsquo;m not an ignorant hater and bigot. I&rsquo;m just being their conscience&hellip; </p>

<p>Lovely! Here&rsquo;s an idea Ms Gillard (sorry to be insubordinate) use this cash at HOME. There&rsquo;s plenty of Aussie wokers and their families scrounging from week to week. There&rsquo;s also plenty of sub-standard schools that can&rsquo;t even churn out a base-level worker with rudimentary English skills; after they&rsquo;ve been there for twelve years.</p>
<p>&#8220;in an effort to improve the prospects of Indonesia&rsquo;s youth&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Godalbloodymighty! What about the youth of Austalia? </p>
<p>&#8220;Dr Yudhoyono backed away from endorsing Ms Gillard&rsquo;s proposed refugee processing centre&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s it then. Maybe she&rsquo;s not that concerned about <br>
improving the prospects of Indonesia&rsquo;s youth after all.</p>

<p>It sounds like the Aussies aren&rsquo;t doing this simply to win brownie points for helping the suffering&hellip;uh, brownies, but rather to draw the Indonesian kiddies away from becoming frothing-at-the-mouth Shair&rsquo;ia advocates.</p>
<p>And yeah, as the guy above me says, one way to do that is to introduce feminism and MTV rap.  Not man-boy love, however.  Trust me&hellip;Muslims need no introduction to THAT topic!<br>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it just be easier to spend the money on your military instead and change immigration so any frothing at the mouth types(or other 3rd worlders) can&rsquo;t enter Australia. They can&rsquo;t do harm to them in their own country if they can&rsquo;t enter.</p>

		<p>Australia should have used this money too help boost the Australian birth rate like what Russia has done. Build more day care centres for working couples, spend money on advert campaigns encouraging Australians to have more children or just give money to White couples to have more kids. All white nations need to follow in Russia&rsquo;s footsteps instead on wasting money interfering in the non-White world.<br>

		<p>I agree 100% with poster #15. They can&rsquo;t hurt you in your country if YOU DON&rsquo;T LET THEM INTO YOUR COUNTRY! As far as military matters go, I think Australia should acquire nuclear weapons as an ultimate guarantee of their territorial integrity. They have plenty of space to deploy such weapons and can&rsquo;t hope to match the Asiatic countries in their midst by manpower. I also think trying to raise the birthrate is a laudable idea too.</p>

		<p>Whilst the reason may sound noble surely we should fix our own backyard before we start tampering with some else&rsquo;s.  As a taxpayer I would prefer to see our own education, social, health,defence and financial system supported to the full extent.  I may sound skeptical but money we spend in support of Indonesia&rsquo;s education program is money they do not have to spend which in turn means that they are then free to allocate resources to other areas. eg; Defence etc.</p>
<p>In this area I believe we are very naive.  You may not believe it but Australia is recognised by Asians as being easily led when it comes to handouts. Perhaps we should follow the Singaporean example by placing ourselves in a stronger economic, military, financial and progressive situation before we start worrying about other developing countries.      </p>
