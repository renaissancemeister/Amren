<h1>Can States Restrict Their &#8220;Supportive Nudges&#8221; to Graduate Students By Race?</h1>

<p>In &#8220;<b><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Supportive-Nudge-for/125212/?sid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en">A Supportive Nudge for Minority Graduate Students on the Path to a Ph.D.</a></b>,&#8221; the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education </i>recently reported on the <b>Compact for Faculty Diversity</b>&rsquo;s annual <b>Institute on Teaching and Mentoring</b>. The Compact for Faculty Diversity has what its web site acknowledges is &#8220;a simple goal: to increase the number of minority students who earn doctoral degrees and become college and university faculty.&#8221; The Institute on Teaching and Mentoring, now in its 17th year, &#8220;has become the largest gathering of minority doctoral scholars in the country.&#8221; Its goal, as the <i>Chronicle</i> reported, is &#8220;to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who earn doctoral degrees and become faculty members.&#8221;<br/><br/>Both the Institute and the Compact are closely affiliated with the <b>Southern Regional Education Board</b> (SREB), whose <b><a href="http://www.sreb.org/page/1074/doctoral_scholars.html">State Doctoral Scholars Program</a></b> is the &#8220;<b>primary coordinator</b>&#8221; of their activities, <b><a href="http://www.sreb.org/page/1074/doctoral_scholars.html">hosts</a></b> the annual Institute, and provides financial assistance to doctoral scholars. And who is eligible for SREB doctoral scholarships? Its <b><a href="http://www.sreb.org/page/1114/am_i_eligible.html">Am I Eligible?</a></b> site explains: &#8220;Yes! If you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; are a Ph.D. candidate, within the first year of the Ph.D. program or are expecting admission, have completed all course work and preliminary exams, are a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident, etc., etc., and &#8220;<b>are a member of a racial or ethnic minority (including African-American, Asian American, Hispanic/Latin American, Native American or others)</b>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;..&#8221; [Emphasis added]<br/><br/>The SREB&rsquo;s State Doctoral Scholars Program has <b><a href="http://www.sreb.org/page/1074/doctoral_scholars.html">support</a></b> from The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Ford Foundation, organizations that, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with its <b><a href="http://www.gmsp.org/">Gates Millennium Scholars</a></b>, seem to leave few race preference programs unfunded (behavior that, I&rsquo;ve argued <b>here</b> and elsewhere, should make them lose their tax exemptions for the <b><a href="http://www.discriminations.us/2002/06/bob_jones_adverse_possession_a.html">same reasons Bob Jones University did</a></b>).</p></div>
<p>The Southern Regional Education Board, however, is supported by more than liberal foundations promoting race preference policies; it is also <b>intimately imbued and entwined with state action</b>.<br/><br/></p>
<blockquote>SREB is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that works with 16 member states to improve public pre-K-12 and higher education. Founded by the region&rsquo;s governors and legislators in 1948, SREB was America&rsquo;s first interstate compact for education. Today it is the only regional education compact that works directly with state leaders, schools and educators to improve teaching, learning and student achievement at every level of education.&nbsp;.&nbsp;..<br/><br/>SREB is governed by a Board that includes the governor and four gubernatorial appointees from each member state, including at least one state legislator and one educator. Click on your state at the top right of this page for more details on how SREB serves your state. It is supported by annual appropriations from the member states and by funds from philanthropic foundations and state and federal agencies. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The current Chair is North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue; its past chairman was Governor (now Senator-elect) Joe Manchin of West Virginia. In SREB&rsquo;s current <b><a href="../../../../2010/10E08_2010_SREB_Ann_Rep.pdf">Annual Report</a></b>, SREB President Dave Spence emphasized this governmental support:<br/><br/>
<blockquote>SREB is about our 16 states and their education policy leaders. We have been so fortunate to have our states continue to support SREB even in these tough economic times and to continue to have the dedicated support of so many Board and Legislative Advisory Council members who have a special affinity for SREB.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Thus, unless I&rsquo;m missing something, it seems clear that these sixteen states are at least indirectly funding racially restrictive scholarship, and many of those states are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which in <b><a href="http://openjurist.org/38/f3d/147/podberesky-v-e-kirwan">Podberesky v. Kirwan</a></b>, 38 F.3d 147 (1994), specifically prohibited such scholarships.<br/><br/>Can states fund through third parties activities that they are prohibited from doing directly?

		<p>I doubt that the surplus of highly qualified doctoral students has shrunk in terms of faculty openings in recent years. In some specialized areas like medical or engineering research, or areas of physics, there may be shortages.These are usually made up by Chinese or other foreign Phds filling positions. This is unfortunate, because often these exeperts know the field quite well, but make poor teachers because of accent and cultural distinctions. </p>
<p>However, for the vast majority of faculty openings that don&rsquo;t require decades of scholarship or teaching, there are dozens of highly qualified candidates with extremely high high GRE scores and theses of distinction, peer-reviewed without the need to teach simple arithmetic or grammar to would be assistant professors. </p>
<p>But since China and India will run this place (the USA and its economic and  education system) sooner rather than later, what difference does it make anyway?</p>

    <br/>
Affirmative action does not create opportunities.  It takes them from those who deserve them, and gives them to those who do not.  </p>

The SREB&rsquo;s State Doctoral Scholars Program has support from The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Ford Foundation, organizations that, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with its Gates Millennium Scholars, seem to leave few race preference programs unfunded (behavior that, I&rsquo;ve argued here and elsewhere, should make them lose their tax exemptions for the same reasons Bob Jones University did).</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Thus, unless I&rsquo;m missing something, it seems clear that these sixteen states are at least indirectly funding racially restrictive scholarship, and many of those states are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which in Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147 (1994), specifically prohibited such scholarships.</p>
<p>Can states fund through third parties activities that they are prohibited from doing directly? <br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>What is there to miss?  If you are a high profile member of an elite class with whacko agendas on &#8216;how to improve society&rsquo;, rules are less bent than ignored to step around you and insodoing, the corporate &#8216;dispute resolution&rsquo; nature of our legal system becomes ever more prevalent in it&rsquo;s unequal application:</p>
<p>Where there is no disputation, no one will question a &#8216;commercial practice&rsquo;.  The South should have Inc&rsquo;d themselves and we wouldn&rsquo;t have half our present problems.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think charities are different, simply because they are tax-free.</p>
<p>Why do you think 3% of our national population controls some 35% of it&rsquo;s capitalization through charities and funds?  Because the exact application of those funds to &#8216;projects&rsquo; less and less socially equitable if not outright illicit with more politicizeable potential as racial dynamite can be hidden rather than confronted behind grants and sub foundations whose agendas are literally masked from public view until they explode as fait de accompli of course.</p>
<p>Often flagshipped by a smiling pale face nobody wants to demonize for being /anti white/.</p>

		<p>They can push through all the black/latino affirmative action &#8216;degrees&rsquo; they want, but at the end of the day no asian or indian owned businesses EVER hires blacks and latinos for anything.  (Oh, asians of all types hire illegals to clean the bathrooms, cut the lawns and cook the food.)  I say this because only white owned businesses ever give non-whites a leg up, and white owned businesses of any size or consequence are getting increasingly harder to find.</p>

<p>Not sure I&rsquo;d limit ignoring-white-concerns to professional basketball. There are nearly Entire cities now where there aren&rsquo;t very many whites, and when they call for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; there too, they mean a desire for and to serve even more people of color. </p>

		<p>I walked through my local university the other day, and I didn&rsquo;t see even one blond professor. RACISM! I DEMAND affirmative action!</p>
<p>When one reads stories like this, one feels that America is in free-fall, and that the only unresolved question is exactly when the SPLAT! will occur. </p>
