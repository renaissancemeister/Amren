			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Gilligan, London Telegraph, November 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A website which influenced a young Muslim to stab an MP has posted dozens more MPs&rsquo; names on a &#8216;death list&rsquo; with an exhortation to Muslims to follow her example.</p>
<p>Revolutionmuslim.com was named by Roshonara Choudhry in her police interviews as one of the sites which radicalised her. Choudhry was sentenced to life imprisonment on Wednesday for attempting to murder the former Labour minister Stephen Timms.</p>
<p>The site praises her as a &#8220;mujaahidah,&#8221; or holy warrior, saying: &#8220;We ask Allah to keep her safe and secure, to hasten her release and to reward this heroine immensely.&#8221;</p>
<p>It published a list of all the MPs who voted for the Iraq war together with an instruction to Muslims to try to kill them, saying: &#8220;We ask Allaah for her action to inspire Muslims to raise the knife of Jihaad against those who voted for the countless rapes, murders, pillages, and torture of Muslim civilians as a direct consequence of their vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also appears to incite further attacks on Mr Timms, publishing details of his constituency surgery times and venues, and even a link which shows readers where they can buy a Â£15 kitchen knife, similar to the one used by Choudhry, from Tesco Direct.</p>
<p>The website adds: &#8220;If you want to track an MP, you can find out their personal website after typing their name in this website. In their personal website, you can usually find the time and location of their surgeries where you can encounter them in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site then lists the 139 Conservative MPs that voted for the war and the 244 Labour MPs. It said that no Liberal Democrats voted for the war but added: &#8220;They have now formed a coalition government with the Conservatives.&#8221; Accompanying the statement is a prayer in Arabic to &#8220;destroy your enemy and the enemies of Islam&#8221; naming Mr Timms and the judge in the Choudhry case, Jeremy Cooke.</p>
<p>The website is hosted in the US, where the White House has been urged by British ministers to take urgent action against similar sites.</p>
<p>Patrick Mercer, a former chairman of the Commons homeland security subcommittee and one of the MPs on the &#8216;death list&rsquo;, said: &#8220;If they think this will change my opinions or my conduct in any way, they can think again. These sites are extremely dangerous, as the case of Choudhry has shown, and this one must be taken down immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Choudhry stabbed Mr Timms twice at one of his surgeries in Beckton, east London, in May, saying she had done so to punish him for voting for the Iraq war.</p>
<p>The Revolutionmuslim website claims some foreknowledge of Choudhry&rsquo;s actions, saying that four days before her &#8220;operation,&#8221; she read a work entitled &#8220;The Book of Jihad&#8221; by Abi Zakaryya Al Dimashqi Al Dumyati, something not reported in any of the coverage of the case.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether this claim is true. However, Choudhry did directly cite &#8220;a website called revolutionmuslim&#8221; in her police interviews as one of several radical sites she looked at.</p>
<p>She told officers that she had been radicalised after &#8220;learning more about Islam&#8221; online. She said she had dowloaded more than a hundred hours of sermons by Anwar al-Awlaki, the terrorist cleric described by the US as the spiritual leader of three of the 9/11 hijackers. Awlaki, an American citizen living in Yemen, has been singled out by the head of MI5, Jonathan Evans, as a figure &#8220;of particular concern&#8221; to the security services.</p>
<p>Revolutionmuslim.com includes a number of YouTube videos of Awlaki, which can still be accessed, despite the provider promising to take them down. It also includes a video by Abdullah Azzam, the al-Qaeda spiritual leader, another figure cited as an influence by Choudhry in her police interviews.</p>
<p>The website claims a number of authors. It appears to be strongly influenced by supporters of the British Muslim extremist Anjem Choudary, formerly a senior figure in the now banned Al-Muhajiroun and Islam4UK groups. It carries a number of press releases and video clips from Choudary and also includes a video of Abu Izzadeen, another British extremist linked to Choudary, emerging from prison.</p>
<p>Islam4UK earned notoreity when it proposed to demonstrate against the ceremonies held in Wootton Basset, Wiltshire, to honour service personnel killed in Afghanistan, though the demonstrations never took place. Revolutionmuslim recently publicised a flag-burning ceremony to be attended by Choudary  &mdash;  which also apparently never happened  &mdash;  outside the US embassy in London on the ninth anniversary of September 11.</p>
<p>One of the site&rsquo;s alleged authors, a 20-year-old American from Virginia, Zachary Chesser, was arrested in July and charged with providing material support to a Somali-based al-Qaeda terrorist group. Chesser, an alleged follower of al-Awlaki, was reported to have written a post on the site threatening the creators of the American cartoon series, South Park, with death for including a caricature of Mohammed in one episode.</p>
<p>Revolutionmuslim&rsquo;s writers  &mdash;  all operating under aliases  &mdash;  include at least three people who state on their online profiles that they are British. Three of the profiles link to websites closely connected to Choudary and his allies, including the banned cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed. Revolutionmuslim.com advertises an &#8220;Islamic revival conference&#8221; due to take place later this month in East London with speakers including Choudary, Izzadeen and, by telephone from Lebanon, Bakri Mohammed.</p>
<p>The website appears to be hosted by a service provider called Enom, based in Bellevue in the US state of Washington. Calls to the company were not answered.</p>
<p>Choudary could not be reached for comment. Contacted by The Daily Telegraph, Izzadeen denied involvement in the site but said it was a product of the &#8220;awakening&#8221; of Muslims. He did not endorse the site&rsquo;s call for killings of MPs but refused to condemn it, saying: &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a condemner of anything. People have their own views. We&rsquo;ll just wait and see if anything happens.&#8221;<br>

		<p>How very fitting that the politician she tried to kill was a member of the Marxist Labour party. They were wholly responsible for turning Britain into the multi-racial dungheap it is now and they are reaping what they have sown.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s a political advert the BNP can use in it&rsquo;s next (hopefully more succes campaigns)</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want Anjem Choudary for a nieghbor, vote Labor&#8221;.</p>
<p>And then include the photo of the dark, hairy, hateful Anjem Choudary. All of us look like Swedish models compared to this guy.</p>

		<p>Prediction:<br>
This will be used as an excuse to further curtail freedom of speech on American Websites.  However, as with every other law or policy enacted in response to some Muslim atrocity, Muslims will magically be exempted from the effects of whatever restrictive measures are made law.  They will be free to proceed with impunity.</p>
<p>As usual, Christians, not Muslims, will lose freedoms, due to Muslim criminality.</p>

I have read, that there were tens of thousands of black immigrants in Britain in the 17th century. <br>
The queen deported all back to Africa so there were no race problems, there were no high crime levels and so on and Britain got the World Power.</p>
<p>Maybe its time to do it again.</p>

		<p>The irony is that the Labour Party (despite the episode when Tony Blair displeased his Pakistani paymasters over Iraq), is little more than the political wing of the Pakistani immigrant lobby.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see now. A Muslim female emigree stabs a British MP in east London. Britain&rsquo;s solution is to try to get the U.S. government to shut down a website hosted in the USA. Reminds me of the Mexican government blaming the Second Amendment for Mexican drug cartels killing police and politicians.</p>
<p>Danged if Nick Griffin and Mark Collett warned the British that this would happen. Instead, they were denounced as racists, and fomenting anti-Islamic hate against the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;. They were tried like criminals, because they spoke the TRUTH.</p>
<p>This is what Britain gets for doing nothing while Muslims rioted in several British towns in the past few years. I would not want to be in London during the 2012 Summer Olympics. In fact, I can see some act of terrorism taking place then.</p>

		<p>German at 2.55 may well have read that there were &#8220;tens of thousands of black immigrants in England in the 17th century&#8221;.This however is just one of so many lies put out by the multi-cultist elites to undermine the ethnic integrity of the English,and other European peoples.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with you.  I mean, are we to think that all these good little Muslims in England were perfect little angels, then all of a sudden they &#8220;stumble upon&#8221; some &#8220;extremist website&#8221; hosted in the U.S., and that&rsquo;s what made them go naughty?  Almost no mention on who runs this U.S. &#8220;extremist website&#8221; or why.  These Muslims were already extreme, the website just confirmed their hate.</p>
