			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, November 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Newsweek&rsquo;s depiction of President Obama on its latest cover has irked some Indian Americans who, fresh off Obama&rsquo;s visit to the world&rsquo;s largest democracy, are not happy with the image of the U.S. president as the Hindu deity, Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>The Newsweek cover shows Obama with several arms carrying policy issues while balancing on one leg. The headline reads: &#8220;God of All Things&#8221; with a subtitle, &#8220;Why the Modern Presidency May be too Much for One Person to Handle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shiva, who is one of three pre-eminent gods in the Hindu religion along with Brahma and Vishnu, is considered the destroyer of the world, which must end, metaphorically speaking, in order to be reborn as a more universalistic place. However, the god&rsquo;s purpose is not to foretell an apocalyptic ending.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Hinduism&rsquo;s sacred images are too often appropriated in popular culture without understanding their spiritual relevance to Hindus,&#8221; she [Suhag Shukla, managing director and legal counsel of the Washington-based Hindu-American Foundation] said. &#8220;For Hindus, the iconography gives insight into the divine realm, and each aspect of representation is replete with profound symbolism that is lost and even debased by such attempts at humor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shukla, who noted that Hindu images are frequently used in media as caricatures because of a fundamental lack of understanding about the very complex religion, said it&rsquo;s impossible to retract the image since the magazine reached mailboxes on Friday. {snip}</p>

		<p>I guess it&rsquo;s still okay to pick on Hindu&rsquo;s.<br>
They should&rsquo;ve portrayed Obama as Muhammed.<br>
More accurate any way.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no Hindu, and I&rsquo;m offended by that cover. To refer to Obama as a &#8220;god&#8221; or any &#8220;deity&#8221;, even in jest or irony is just too close to the hysterical adulation of him as the &#8220;Messiah&#8221; just before and during the 2008 election. </p>

		<p>Funny, when Reagan and the two George Bushes were in the White House they were regularly slammed by the liberal media for their job performances.</p>
<p>Now that an incompetent black man is fumbling, bumbling and stumbling around the Oval Office the press suddenly whine that &#8220;The Modern Presidency may Be too much For One Person To Handle&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Ha ha, Newsweek, in its attempt at political correctness in its Obama worship ended up only shooting itself in the foot! Expect a front-page apology in a forthcoming issue, along with the appropriate penance and self-flagellation.</p>
<p><i> fresh off Obama&rsquo;s visit to the world&rsquo;s largest democracy</i></p>
<p>Yeah, and wasn&rsquo;t that democracy established by those evil British colonizers? Maybe we need a major motion picture about that&hellip;</p>

		<p>The thing about Oboma is that he inherited the problems of the Bush administration and then compounded them by being a totally left wing president. He simply can&rsquo;t win for losing. I&rsquo;m glad he will be a one term president but hold little faith in the Republicans. I&rsquo;m voting for the third parties canidate and don&rsquo;t really care whetheer my guy wins or not. Votes should be made on principle rather than for the lessor of two evils.</p>

		<p><i>fundamental lack of understanding about the very complex religion</i></p>
<p>Hinduism is considered a form of Pantheism not Polytheism. While it appears they have multiple Gods those Gods simply represent different aspects of the one God that manifests itself in the universe.</p>

		<p>Shiva is the destroyer in the Indian creation/destruction cycle.  I can&rsquo;t think of a more appropriate representation.</p>

<p>And I am sure that is exactly what those multicultural fools are driving at, when they presented Comrade BO as a Marxist Shiva. That is the whole point of their mad secular religion, to destroy the United States and the West, and remake them into a &ldquo;more universalistic&rdquo; peons&rsquo; paradise. Plus, they probably think it is very cute to present it this way because it demonstrates their &ldquo;superior knowledge&rdquo; of other cultures, that they feel is so lacking in Middle America. Of course the Indian community is less than amused by their kindergarten attempts at cosmopolitanism, and we are now treated to yet another circus of diversity&rsquo;s &ldquo;strength.&rdquo; I am sure Newsweek will soon be issuing some halfhearted apology to the Indians, who will in return demand some outrageous compensation and someone&rsquo;s head tossed into a local Calcutta Town&rsquo;s version of the black hole.   </p>
<p> As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>As others have noticed, races mirror the Hindu trinity well.  Shiva the destroyer, are blacks, Vishnu, the preserver are akin to Asians, and Brahma, the creator, are whites.</p>

		<p>To Madison Grant: The modern Presidency is too much for any Black, because basic School work seems to be too much for them, as well.  </p>
<p>Our Republican form of Government was never meant to be led by inferior types, since Government by consent of the governed is not a concept any of the Black and brown people can relate to. </p>
<p>They are at their best with a Tribal Chief, and Witch Doctor, and all of current Africa, and Haiti proves it. </p>
