<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former President George W. Bush says that Kanye West&rsquo;s insinuation that he is a racist, made in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, still stings today  &mdash;  and that the episode was the &#8220;all-time low&#8221; point of his presidency.</p>
<p>Bush&rsquo;s long-delayed reaction to West&rsquo;s ad-libbed comment that &#8220;George Bush doesn&rsquo;t care about black people,&#8221; made during a live TV benefit show for hurricane survivors, is from an interview the former president taped with Matt Lauer of NBC.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the exchange, from an early transcript the network released, as quoted by Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly:<blockquote.&#8221;he called me a racist,&#8221; bush tells lauer. &#8220;and i didn&rsquo;t appreciate it then. i don&rsquo;t appreciate it now. it&rsquo;s one thing to say, &#8216;i don&rsquo;t appreciate the way he&rsquo;s handled his business.&rsquo; it&rsquo;s another thing to say, &#8216;this man&rsquo;s a racist.&rsquo; i resent it, it&rsquo;s not true.&#8221;< p>
<p>Lauer quotes from Bush&rsquo;s new book: &#8220;Five years later I can barely write those words without feeling disgust.&#8221; Lauer adds, &#8220;You go on: &#8216;I faced a lot of criticism as president. I didn&rsquo;t like hearing people claim that I lied about Iraq&rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction or cut taxes to benefit the rich. But the suggestion that I was racist because of the response to Katrina represented an all-time low.&rsquo;</p>
<p>President Bush responds: &#8220;Yeah. I still feel that way as you read those words. I felt &rsquo;em when I heard &rsquo;em, felt &rsquo;em when I wrote &rsquo;em, and I felt &rsquo;em when I&rsquo;m listening to &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>Lauer: &#8220;You say you told Laura at the time it was the worst moment of your presidency?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bush: &#8220;Yes. My record was strong, I felt, when it came to race relations and giving people a chance. And it was a disgusting moment.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The low point of the Bush presidency was when he was elected.  And it went down hill from there.  How pathetic that the President of the United States would ever care about whatever a black rapper &#8220;thinks,&#8221; one way or the other.</p>

		<p>So, his low point was when someone criticized him, but not when his administration pushed for no-downpayment loans to Minorities (which initiated the current recession), or when he attacked Iraq, a nation that had not, could not, and would not attack us (which led to unbelievable misery, torture, social disruption, and death in that nation, killed or wounded thousands of young American soldiers, and cost the USA billions and billions of Dollars).  </p>
<p>No, Economic collapse of the USA and the deaths of ~500,000+ Iraqis do not bother him   &mdash;   Kayne West&rsquo;s comments did!  </p>

		<p>Man, if Bush thinks that a comment by a black rapper was the low point of his presidency, he&rsquo;s living in a fantasy world.</p>
<p>This was the guy who presided over the collapse of the American economy and lied about weapons of mass destruction to justify his pointless invasion of Iraq. 9/11 happened on his watch. He left the country in a smoking pile of rubble when he finally departed.</p>
<p>It boggles my mind that there has been absolutely no accountability for the Bush Mob&rsquo;s crimes and incompetence. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this lack of accountability has destroyed what little was left of the federal government&rsquo;s credibility and the less said about the Republicans the better.</p>
<p>No country can survive &#8220;leaders&#8221; like Bush and Obama. It&rsquo;s just not possible.</p>

		<p>The low point in bushes career was when after being elected running on countering all the damage the Clinton administration did to this country. Instead allowing Karl Rove to set a conciliatory policy toward the democrats. Leaving him just an incompetent, make believe conservative, and the lesser of 2 evils, rather than a true leader.</p>

I would have thought it would be 9-11 or meeting the parents of sons and daughters who died because of his lies.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have long learned that it&rsquo;s pointless dealing with blacks. Nothing you can say or do will please them or placate them. The best thing you can do is avoid them as best you can and don&rsquo;t lose any sleep over how they feel about you (because, frankly, they hate you).<br>

		<p>Bush is living in denial.  The low point of his Presidency, and there were many of them, were the yellow cake Congressional hearings on Iraq, calling the Minute Men vigilantes, holding prayer breakfasts to pray for America for not granting amnesty to illegals, sicking Linda Chavez on conservatives, letting the number of illegals double during his Presidency, allowing loose lending standards to minorities precipitate a mortgage meltdown, etc., I could name hundreds of things that are of more significance than some obscure rapper&rsquo;s accusations.</p>

<p>LOL!  </p>
<p>Imagine that!  Bush believes being called a racist is worse than &#8216;lying about Iraq&rsquo;s weapons&rsquo; or accused of &#8216;cutting taxes for the rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Is he right?</p>
<p>Even Jeffrey Dahmer wanted it made clear in court that his choice of victim had &#8216;absolutely nothing to do with race&rsquo;, being that accusations of &#8216;racism&rsquo; are much worse than serial killing or cannibalism.</p>

   Yes, our former president was more upset by being labeled a &#8220;racist&#8221; by an obnoxious, arrogant rapper, than by starting an unprovoked war on false pretenses. Such is the tortured psyche of our last &#8220;Conservative&#8221; Republican president.</p>

		<p>What a moron!  Being considered a racist is the best thing that could happen to Bush. The interview of his book on Oprah made me ill! His remorse about Katrina also made me want to puke. His daughter was married on the Crawford Ranch by a black &#8220;preacher who looked like he came straight out of Nigeria. Both his daughters work with black kids and go to Africa to &#8220;help&#8221; them. This was on a special with Laura Bush. Yeah, Bush, being called a racist is the worst thing that ever happened to you. The neocons are a big joke. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Bush. He said that as a decoy to take away the fact that he ordered an invasion of a country that had did the US no wrong and he ordered that invasion under false pretenses. He has sent Americans to die and to be maimed for life for his own selfish agenda. He has raised not one of his bloody fingers to stop this invasion by Mexicans and OTMs of our southern border all the while making statements and trying to get legislation that encourage more of this invasion. He also participate in the economic destruction of not only the present generation of Americans but also future generations of Americans. That smirk he carried throughout his presidency was his badge of shame. <br>
The fact that this globalist Bush says some racist statement by some lame brained rapper was his low point during his disaster of an administration just underlines his contempt for white Americans. </p>

<p>So true!  One thing I NEVER hear about is just how MANY of our soldiers in combat who have died were WHITE men? I will wager at least 95%. Losing good White men like this is what makes me sick!  We have lost the future WHITE babies these men may have had. Not only in this war but in the Civil War, WW1 and WW11, and all other wars thereafter!  Just imagine all the millions of WHITE babies that would have been born and now living with children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to add to the dwindling White population. </p>
<p>Do you think these wars were all a part of the plan to rid the earth of us &#8220;evil&#8221; Whites who our enemy wants so dearly?</p>

Although I don&rsquo;t think Bush was the greatest President and made a number of questionable decisions I think he always took responsibility for what he did.  I think the best example of that was Iraq War in 2006.  By this point in time Bush had realized that he had made a major mistake and knew that most of the country was against him on this issue.  I remember Bush being quoted as saying,&#8221;I will not withdraw even if Laura and Barney are the only ones supporting me.&#8221;  For better or worse he took responsibility and resolved the crisis, temporarily.</p>

&#8220;It must be something in the water here in Texas, LBJ couldn&rsquo;t figure out why the blacks kept burning cities when all his give-a-ways were for the blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>yes, very true. Texas has given us the worst national leaders LBJ being the worst, George Dubya being really bad - and it&rsquo;s always packaged in that the guy is supposedly some tough Texas Cowboy, a regular (White) guy, not some sissy East Coast Ivy League Liberal like Mike Dukakis or Gore - LBJ and George Bush are tough Texans&hellip;.</p>
<p>who break down and cry when some Black rap &#8220;singer&#8221; calls them a racist or when the New York Times or the Washington Post does the same.</p>
<p>These Texans usually send their children to Harvard and Yale so they won&rsquo;t be dismissed as hicks from the country - George W Bush actually went to both Yale and Harvard where he was a frat boy, male cheer leader.</p>

		<p>Poor Mr. Bush! How sad for him that he had a low point in his presidency! I did too! It was the day that he got elected the first time. I admit that there was not much of a choice, but I knew that when he mouthed the words &#8220;compassionate conservative&#8221; with reference to himself he&rsquo;d be compassionate with my money. Sure enough! He gave it away in buckets. And, in case he didn&rsquo;t state it in his book, he wanted to be known as &#8220;the housing president&#8221;. That meant that he wanted to house minorities. I knew that wouldn&rsquo;t be at his expense. None of these rich boys want to spend their own money on their grandiose schemes. No! They want to get there on our dime. I can&rsquo;t get my money back. That clown is now sitting around the campfire in Muleshoe TX, or where ever, singing cowboy songs and lamenting his lost greatness. But I don&rsquo;t have to buy his  book. And I won&rsquo;t. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the little bit of &#8220;hurt&#8221; that he suffered as a result of whatever Kanye West said is nothing compared to the hurt he put on this once great nation. Most people think he&rsquo;s a &#8220;nice guy&#8221;. They are wrong. He didn&rsquo;t mind torture for people, and he left the border wide open which hurt this nation greatly. If/when an honest history of this nation is ever written, he&rsquo;ll go down as one of it&rsquo;s most evil villains! Don&rsquo;t buy his book!</p>

		<p>1. George W. Bush lied about the supposed weapons of mass destruction that Sadam Hussein did not possess, which he used as a casus belli for the American War of Agression in Iraq; it has so far resulted in the deaths of 100,000+ civilians and millions of displaced people.</p>
<p>2. George W. Bush didn&rsquo;t do enough to protect the US from the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>3. George W. Bush implemented the idiotic no child left behind policy.</p>
<p>4. George W. Bush&rsquo;s policies helped create the current economic recession.</p>
<p>The list of low-point blunders goes on. And, Bush thinks being called a wacist by a rapper is the lowest point in his presidency. What a joke.</p>

		<p>In defence of Prez Bush, perhaps his disgust was a political. He had invested much political capital to gain Black support. West&rsquo;s observation made him realize that his efforts were wasted.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why he cared since he had been reelected, but the mentalality  of America&rsquo;s political leaders is unfathomable to me.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The difference? NYPD and FDNY are largely Italian, Irish, Anglo or of eastern/southern European descent&#8221;</p>
<p>I have wondered what with AA and all in NYC hust how many black fire department and Police/rescue people were killed in the tower collapse. Anyone know? I don&rsquo;t doubt there were some, but would like to know the %age as the blacks are always wanting some equal parity in representation in everything.</p>

		<p>Look, I won&rsquo;t even condescend to write, or speak that black non-musician&rsquo;s silly little &#8220;name.&#8221; So very infantile, full of puffery, false bravado and a sagging IQ. <br>
A talentless moron puffing up his chest making vile gestures to a brain-dead white populace so degraded, as to actually suffer the sound of that voice, and those rude utterances.</p>
<p>And Bush cared whether that lump even EXISTED? The mutterings or rants of such a low life don&rsquo;t amount to a spider&rsquo;s fart.<br>
What can I say, except DUBYA is in the bowl. He&rsquo;s clogging it up. Get the coat hanger and flush him</p>

		<p>What levels stupid white men would stoop to!  Worried about what some barely  literate rapper says about him?  Also, I&rsquo;m sick of hearing about New Orleans period!  True, it was a massive screwup on all levels, but black people through their stupidity, violence, and overall inability to function in western civilisation made the situation much much worse! I was living in Alabama at the time, volunteered to help out on the Gulf Coast, and saw first hand what a mess New Orleans was!  Incidentally, predominantly white areas were badly hit too, but of course our glorious mainstream media never bothered to talk about that fact much. Also, in Nashville, Tenn., we had a bad flood last year, but becuase we didn&rsquo;t riot, the media largely ignored what was going on.</p>

Absolutely. How would he even know what some worthless, moronic black rapper says?  Is the stuff his &#8220;brainy&#8221; daughters listen to at home?  Probably.</p>
<p>Forget about identifying the lowpoint of his presidency (there were too many to count);  the low point of this country was the 2nd election of &#8220;Dubya&#8221;  Bush.  It&rsquo;s because of Bush that we have Obama!  Many people were desperate for any alternative, and that&rsquo;s what we were offered. At that point, anything looked preferable. It&rsquo;s like offering a drowning man a choice of poison instead.</p>

Is Bush trying to say that he actually cares about black people?  Anyway, did Bush a good explanation of why help came so slow to the Katrina victims.  And why is Kanye West apologizing now for?  Bush still dosen&rsquo;t care about black people after all, or just plain ordinary American&rsquo;s for that matter.</p>
<p>Weird that being called a racist is worst than slaughtering thousands in Iraq.</p>

		<p>You guys are aware that Bush is a New England native, right?  Born in Connecticut, I believe (that or Massachusetts, can&rsquo;t remember which off the top of my head).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s astounding how offended people get when you dare to suggest that *gasp!* there ARE differences between the races! Lefties hate and despite realists/racists, yet want to make sure a murderer&rsquo;s human rights aren&rsquo;t violated.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t care less what some rapper says.  Not worth listening to.</p>

<p>Connecticut.  He just happened to be born there. A technicality.  Not sure what you&rsquo;re getting at.   </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not an &#8220;Old Stock&#8221; New Englander. Sort of an &#8220;anchor baby&#8221;.   His grandfather came from the Midwest. The Bushes have been carpetbaggers with each generation.  </p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s Texas and Florida.  Where next?  Mexico???</p>
