<h1><a href="https://www.examiner.com/conservative-in-national/splc-warning-could-get-conservatives-killed">SPLC Warning Could Get Conservatives Killed</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anthony G. Martin, National Examiner, November 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The infamous &#8216;Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo; of Montgomery, Alabama, which is known more for its lies and attacks against conservatives than providing legal assistance to the poor, has issued a warning to law enforcement officers that could get conservatives killed.</p>
<p>According to colleague David Codrea, National Gun Rights Examiner, the SPLC issued an alert to law enforcement stating that their lives are in danger during traffic stops if they pull over drivers with &#8216;right wing bumper stickers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The consequence of such a warning is that the lives of thousands of conservatives are placed at high risk.  If law enforcement officials believe that their lives are in danger from every driver who has a conservative bumper sticker, it is not far-fetched to imagine a scenario in which citizens are shot and killed due to the unnecessary and ridiculous assumption by officers that their lives are automatically endangered in such encounters.</p>

		<p>I cannot speak for the rest of the country, but here in Zoo York City most of the (White) police officers I&rsquo;ve met have been Republicans (i.e. right wing).  In my conversations with them I&rsquo;ve learned they take the prattlings of groups like the SPLC with a grain of salt.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pulled over by cops several times in my life (either when I was driving or a passenger).  In each case I (or the driver) pulled over while rolling down the window, turned on the interior light (if it was dark outside), then placed my hands outside the window and kept them there until the officer(s) arrived.  I always spoke politely and respectfully to the officer(s), which helped to keep them at ease.  There was never a problem.  Common sense should come into play when you&rsquo;re in situations like this.  If it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re either an idiot, a criminal, or both.</p>
<p>If anything, I imagine it&rsquo;s the non-White cops (especially the black ones) I&rsquo;d have to worry about.</p>

		<p>Just ANOTHER reason I won&rsquo;t have any sort of stickers, plaques,  signs or other markers on my car. I don&rsquo;t want to be singled out by any gangs, groups or even law-enforcement if I can help it.  I didn&rsquo;t always feel this way, but as a White woman in my fifties and often driving alone, I don&rsquo;t need to go out of my way to draw unwanted and possibly dangerous attention.  </p>

		<p> Now, folks, let&rsquo;s get real. How many law enforcement officers in this country do you think accept things the SPLC says as anything but nonsense? It&rsquo;s obvious that they&rsquo;re much more likely to be shot at or otherwise attacked by black thugs driving with &#8220;Obama&#8221; bumper stickers, than by anyone defending the Second Amendment or other conservative causes. And if you think most police officers don&rsquo;t know that, then you don&rsquo;t know much about police officers.</p>
<p> And speaking of the infamous SPLC, how long will it be before some of those organizations &#8220;targeted&#8221; by them, wise up and start filing a blizzard of lawsuits against them? They could be shut up and put out of business in fairly short order, if the groups they persist in harassing would only do that. Hope the leaders of some of those groups read this, and take heed. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;According to colleague David Codrea, National Gun Rights Examiner, the SPLC issued an alert to law enforcement stating that their lives are in danger during traffic stops if they pull over drivers with &lsquo;right wing bumper stickers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would these be the &ldquo;right wing bumper stickers&rdquo; that support the Fraternal Order of Police, or  such things as the State Police&rsquo;s Widows&rsquo; Fund?</p>
<p>Communist kennels such as the SPLC, which arrogantly hold that policemen &ldquo;enforce racism,&rdquo; need to be investigated for internal terrorism and subsequently liquidated. The police and other branches of the criminal &ldquo;justice&rdquo; system need to realize this and stop the nonsense that allows them to be played like two penny prostitutes, in a card game.</p>
<p>Mr. Policeman, I want you on my side; I see your job as important and required. Those slithering Red snakes, do you really think they view you the same way?</p>
<p>Just something to think about, Mr. Policeman!</p>

		<p>To be fair, I really can&rsquo;t imagine any police officer taking such a claim seriously.  Its highly unlikely an officer would shoot someone simply out of fear at seeing a &#8220;right-wing bumper sticker.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing cop carry unregistered, throw away guns so they can always plant one on any unarmed conservative they shoot by accident. And the resulting false headlines will work toward the SPLC&rsquo;s agenda. So a dead innocent conservative and more anti-gun headlines. It&rsquo;s a win-win situation for the SPLC. </p>

		<p>We all know that a cop faces a higher probability of danger stopping a car with a black driver and an Obama sticker.  It wouldn&rsquo;t matter that the SPLC and the ADL lie so much if it were not for the fact that they are regularly invited to &#8220;train&#8221; police officers.<br>

		<p>I have no love for the SPLC, but I&rsquo;m glad I dug a little deeper here and watched the original video (there&rsquo;s a link in the original article).<br>
They are talking about something called &#8220;sovereign citizens&#8221;, not exactly a mainstream sort of thing  &mdash;  who in their right mind blows away a police officer for pulling them over?<br>
The police should be aware of the potential for harm.</p>

		<p>If a person with a &#8220;right wing&#8221; bumper sticker [whatever that is] is shot and killed by the cops, and that cop can be shown to have read this SPLC bulletin, the SPLC could be held liable in civil court for &#8220;having established a climate&#8221; that led to the shooting.

		<p>The police officers I know won&rsquo;t fall for such nonsense.  They know all too well that their lives are in danger when they stop black people, not people with conservative bumper stickers.  They also know that people with conservative bumper stickers support the police and help them to keep law and order.  The SPLC by doing this only accomplish outing themselves as enemies of our civilization.</p>

If anything should happen, I certainly hope the lawyer for the victim (or their grieving family) is aware of this warning and seeks justice and compensation from those responsible.</p>

		<p>The vast majority of police are right wingers so the SPLC&rsquo;s warning doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.  If the warning were based on reality it should say something like &#8220;Beware of vehicles with Obama/Biden bumper stickers.  It is a proven fact that Obama/Biden supporters are more likely to have criminal records.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police probably feel much safer when they see a right wing bumper sticker.  It&rsquo;s like pulling over one of your own.</p>

		<p>While I find it just north of absurd to assume that most LEOs cannot tell the difference between a casual &#8216;from my cold dead hand&rsquo; and a nutcase looking to generate a life or death incident for a busted tail light; evidence from Ruby Ridge suggests that, at least at the Federal Level such idiocy is possible.</p>
<p>In fact, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if more cops weren&rsquo;t members of the NRA than their casual traffic stops, &#8216;even in Montana&rsquo;, but hey, paranoia sells&hellip;</p>
<p>What bothers me is thaat this comes along with a BATFE standup of added personnel to &#8216;save Mexico from illegal gun smuggling&rsquo; </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3x49yxs" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3x49yxs</a></p>
<p>Which could easily be interpreted as the precursor buildup to an instigated policy (start a fight, justify the crack down) that is an attack on gun ownership itself.</p>
<p>We have the CEO of the world&rsquo;s 10th largest bank saying we are looking at a 20-25 year operating margin before the U.S. debt breaches 69 trillion dollars and is so huge that just the interest payments exceed the national GDP.</p>
<p>But what if it&rsquo;s not that long?</p>
<p>What if the march towards socialization keeps taking a steeper and steeper glide slope down into the sewer?</p>
<p>Of course SPLC is notorious for &#8216;leading events&rsquo; with briefs to USG and national law enforcement agencies that later turn out to be agenda rather than fact driven.</p>
<p>I almost think that they are now a propaganda instrument (&#8216;read the label!&rsquo;) in their own right.</p>

<p>The last time the SPLC tried the same tactic in the mid-nineties with the militias they had the police half afraid to challenge anyone who they thought might be a militia member.  It was the militia who benefitted in that propaganda ploy.</p>
<p>As the economy continues to go further down and the real bad guys from Somalia, Haiti, the Middle East, and the Hmong, and the homegrown terrorists in US training camps the SPLC doesn&rsquo;t consider a threat, all these types will gain higher visibility.</p>
<p>It will soon reach a point when that fat little dope in charge of Homeland Security issues an APB on conservatives to the police, she&rsquo;s just going to be laughed at.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the relevant question:  How many law enforcement officials really believe the SPLC?  Sure, the SPLC (and the ADL, and a lot of their imitators) send their magazines and &#8220;reports&#8221; to cops, in order to be able to claim to their frequent contributors that they have &#8220;established relationships&#8221; with every local yokel sheriff in the country, but I imagine most local PDs and sheriff&rsquo;s departments immediately toss the junk into File 13.</p>
<p>The FBI and other Federal alphabet gang agencies, though, are a different story.</p>

		<p>First, George Soros uses the NAACP to publish a &#8220;report&#8221; on the tea party. Then Lil Timmy fantasizes about the deaths of white senior citizens. And now the $PLC &#8220;warns&#8221; law enforcement against &#8220;right wing bumper stickers&#8221;. Good Lord!

		<p>Considering that Blacks do the majorty of violent crimes in this country, and most likely are the ones more often involved in shoot outs with cops. Plus, most blacks are democrats/leftwing.</p>
<p>So therefore, would it not be more accurate to assume that those with &#8216;left wing bumper stickers&rsquo; are more likely to put a cop in danger?</p>

		<p>Most cops are residents of the general regions in which they work and well understand the people therein.  Most cops, moreover, are conservative themselves.  <br>
The left has gotten even shriller and sillier in its desperate attempts to turn the public away from the surging right.  Radicals have driven almost every moderate and conservative Dem out of that party, and they&rsquo;re now crowing that they&rsquo;re better off having a small concentrate of far-left voters and representatives.  Good luck.</p>

		<p>This article makes me furious. They should be sued for slander. How dare they make such outrageous claims with NO proof to back it up. But just like that race hustler Tim Wise, they&rsquo;ll get away with their hate speech, because the liberal media loves it and won&rsquo;t challenge them on their claims. Even worse, the conservative right won&rsquo;t challenge them on it EITHER! They won&rsquo;t TOUCH the race issue. I just wonder how much more it will take before the &#8220;White Right&#8221; will say they&rsquo;ve had enough and start fighting back with some real venom?</p>

		<p>I drilled down in the story.  Turns out the SPLC &#8220;warning&#8221; originates from some car which didn&rsquo;t have any bumper stickers, whose occupants fired at a cop in Memphis.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t like bumper stickers at all&hellip;mostly idiots use them to foist opinions on others that are inane. <br>
But I agree with posters who say we need not fear cops b/c of right wing stickers. </p>
<p>Just behave like you know what it&rsquo;s like to be a cop.<br>
Pull over. Put your hazards on. turn on your cab light. Roll down the window. Turn the radio off. Put your hands gently on the wheel, or dashboard, or put right  arm on wheel, left arm out window. Be relaxed and casual.  You probably got pulled over for a good reason. Accept that, and be humble. If you&rsquo;re in doubt, just greet the cop and let him have his say.<br>
Be polite and honest. Say hello. </p>
<p>When the cop asks for registration, etc, let him/ her know what moves you&rsquo;re going to make. Say &#8220;My license is in my pants pocket, can I reach for it? &#8221; Meanwhile, move as casually as you would on any other occasion.</p>
<p>You might get asked (because of your very cautious manner) if you have a weapon, but they will very much appreciate that YOU know THEIR life is in danger on traffic stops. In my experience, it ALWAYS even gets me out of a ticket I deserved!<br>
Think white, be smart.<br>

		<p>Lots of clueless conservative statements here, fundamentally based on the way things were 30-50 years ago.  Almost all cops desire promotion.  Prospects for increased pay or a better shift has a tendency to change attitudes.  Cops desiring these things will spend years &#8220;walking the talk.&#8221; To &#8220;walk the talk&#8221; is to meet the expectations of higher-ups.  Now this may not be a problem with Old Sheriff Joe in Podunk, Missouri.  His young manhood is 20-30 years gone. Out in the &#8216;burbs the story is different.  Almost all black and Hispanic officers, and approximately one-third of white officers, do take $PLC and ADL &#8220;warnings&#8221; seriously.  This is based upon my anecdotal experience.  You&rsquo;re free to accept or disregard it.</p>
