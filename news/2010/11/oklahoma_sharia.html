<h1><a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/oklahoma-sharia-ban-may-conflict-with-u-s-constitution/">Oklahoma Sharia Ban May Conflict With U.S. Constitution</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meredith Jessup, The Blaze, November 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Tuesday, Oklahoma voters not only shot down the candidacies of a number of political contenders, but 70 percent of the state&rsquo;s voters chose to ban courts from using Islamic Sharia law in deciding cases.</p>
<p>{snip} The issue reportedly arose after a Muslim woman in New Jersey went to a family court requesting a restraining order against her abusive spouse. The woman&rsquo;s request was denied after the judge ruled that the husband had been rightfully abiding by his Muslim beliefs regarding spousal duties. Though the judge&rsquo;s controversial decision was later overruled by an appellate court, the case drew a firestorm of attention, including the attention of voters in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Further, Sykes also cited comments made by Supreme Court Justice Elena Kana during her June confirmation hearings in which she admitted being willing to consider international law when considering domestic court cases as justification for the initiative.</p>
<p>Before the ballot question passed Tuesday, Muslim leaders dismissed the measure. Saleem Quraishi, president of the American Muslim Association of Oklahoma City called it &#8220;fear mongering.&#8221; And now that the measure is the law of the land, the Center on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) announced Thursday that it&rsquo;s backing a federal lawsuit against the measure, arguing that it violates citizens&rsquo; First Amendment right to practice religion freely.</p>
<p>As written, the approved ballot measure states it would amend a state constitution section dealing with the state courts, making them &#8220;rely on federal and state law when deciding cases, forbidding them &#8220;from considering or using international law&#8221; and &#8220;from considering or using Sharia Law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some legal scholars warn that the measure could have some unintended consequences. According to some legal experts, the measure could create some conflicts for local businesses who deal with some international companies and establishes a precedent that could also ban other religious law, including the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite these potential challenges which may arise in the future, voters in Oklahoma decidedly banned Sharia from their state in what Duncan calls a &#8220;pre-emptive strike&#8221; in protecting America&rsquo;s sovereign laws.<br>

		<p>If these Muslims want Sharia law, let them go back to their own countries. This is America!!!!! Our courts are under American law NOT Sharia or any other religion. I can&rsquo;t believe some liberal idiot judge in New Jersey actually sided with  Sharia law even even though his ruling was later overturned. So if my religion states that I have to have human sacrifice, then murder is ok because it&rsquo;s my religion???? When is politically correct stupidity going to end.</p>

		<p>The Constituitional guarantee of freedom of religion has absolutely NOTHING to do with what laws the courts may enforce in regard to protecting another citizen&rsquo;s rights. As long as these laws do not infringe on the right of an individual to practice his religion in private, the 1st Amendment cannot be invoked.  Asking Sharia Law to be enforced for Muslims in Oklahoma courts is the equivalent of asking the Taliban to allow Common Law to be used in its.  I wouldn&rsquo;t expect Muslims to adopt our law practices, so why should we adopt theirs?  I think this case is another step to a great political and cultural awakening in the West.  We can see opposition to foreign invasions, and Islam in particular, growing larger with each passing day. </p>
<p>What bothers me the most is the fact that Oklahomans have to fear the use of Sharia Law in courts in the first place.  How is it that the Land of the Indians has now become home to an apparently-sizable Islamic population?  Thank you, Immigration Reform Act of 1965.  What wonderful things you have done for this country. *note sarcasm* </p>

		<p>Those involved with such &#8220;judicial review&#8221; really need to take their heads out the clouds of rationaliztion. The article first tells us that if the free practice of religion involves abusing your spouse then abuse is acceptable. These are the same people who believe that the terrorist based salughter of innocent people is acceptable because it is done in the name of their religion. Next, we find that considering the use of Sharia law, or any international law (according to the article), in US courts is actually an option. Finally, they want us to believe that if we want to keep our Ten Commandments, we had better accept Sharia law. Well, supposedly, the Old Testament is as significant to Islam as it is to Judaism and Christianty. Finally, most of the Ten Commandments have nothing to do with religion and are hopefully found in any society&rsquo;s legal code. Or if the Ten Commandments are banned, do we have suddenly have carte blanche to murder, steal and provide false testimony? Everything is such a quandary in our legal system as though no judicial decision can be simply black and white. </p>

		<p>Article 4 Section 4 of the Federal Constitution states that the Federal government should guarantee every state a republican form of government.  It is this provision which disallows Louisiana from using the entirety of Napoleonic legal jurisprudence in its administration of criminal law (i.e. guilty until proven innocent, far higher burden of probable cause needed for an arrest, etc.), even though it can and does use Napoleonic precepts for civil law.  </p>
<p>If LA can&rsquo;t have Napoleonic criminal law, then no state should be able to use Sha&rsquo;ria.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:  Not a lawyer, so I&rsquo;m probably inaccurate here in parts.</p>

<p>No it did not.  As a resident of NJ, I was unaware of this incident.  It most certainly would have drawn much more than &#8220;attention&#8221; here&hellip;.had not the incident been so thoroughly blacked out that I was unaware of it until reading about it here on Amren.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m someone who makes it a point to be far more informed about such things than the average person.  Disturbing that it was so thoroughly covered up&hellip;.and in my own backyard.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to consider moving.</p>

		<p>I agree with #1.  This is USA. Foreigns entering US continue attempts at changing US into whatever country they originate from.  It needs to be made clear by strong leaders that US is not for the taking of foreigns.  If they come here assimilation and acceptance of our way of life and legal system are prerequsites. .  .  and if they want religious legal rights they need remain where these rights are commonly recognized.  The US does not need to cater to foreign religions or dictatorships. <br>
US laws have precedence and are sovereign from outside interests.</p>

		<p>The assertion that the Sharia ban would conflict with the constitution, specifically the First Amendment is ridiculous. Have these Mohammedans even read the First Amendment?!?!</p>
<p>It starts out: &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&#8221;</p>
<p>Using Sharia is in fact what violates the First Amendment. Oklahoma doesn&rsquo;t need to pass this law. Sharia is already illegal in the United States. Any common sense interpretation of the constitution reveals this.</p>

		<p>US law and our Constitution trump international law or religious law which is what Sharia is.  Mormons cannot legally marry more than one spouse though their faith condoned it.  Voodoo cannot legally sacrifice animals.  Christians or Jews cannot legally stone a person to death for religious violations.  The statement we may lose our Ten Commandments or the implied loss of religious freedom is a bugaboo and nothing more.  If there is ANY perceived threat to religion, it comes from the Liberals against Christianity, and in favor of muslims.  This Oklahoma law sets things right and prevents the Liberal attempt to persecute Christians through insane international laws or UN treaties, while notifying muslims we will NOT adopt any portion of religious laws from any religion as Law of the Land excepting those based on our Constitution.<br>
Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how the Liberals seem to be okay with allowing Muslims to push Sharia laws, while shouting &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221; over every petty Christian thing like manger scenes, eh?  The ACLU is okay with Sharia laws being adopted, but fights tooth and nail to remove anything Christian from our society?  </p>

		<p>Hats off to the Oklahomans for making a stand against the scourge of Islam!  </p>
<p>The closest cinematic metaphor you can find for the Muslims are the Borg of &#8220;Star Trek.&#8221;  They are in no way interested in subscribing to ANY the values of ANY of their Host societies the world over from Europe to Asia to North America.  They are only interested in promulgating Islam as the one TRUE religion and in assimilating those places where they come to reside en masse.  Look at sections of Paris, Berlin, even Dearborn, Michigan now.</p>

<p>CONGRESS shall make no law&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The word in caps is the key here.  The 1st Amendment enumerates restrictions on the federal government ONLY.  If I remember correctly Connecticut had an official religion until 1820, and in the early years of the US it was common for religious institutions to be supported by the states. </p>
<p>It was once widely understood that the Constitution of the United States was a document that organized and enumerated the powers of a federal government limited in scope, and that the powers not specifically granted to the federal government were reserved to the states.  Those days are long gone, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>The fact is it is most certainly necessary for laws like this to be enacted, because the liberal left is not always going to control popular opinion in the US and as that changes with our shifting demographics we could find our laws being interpreted in brand-new ways to which we aren&rsquo;t accustomed.</p>
<p>Fighter pilots are taught that it&rsquo;s the enemy you don&rsquo;t see that kills you.  We should take this to heart while we focus on the blacks and Mexicans.  Someone else could come out of nowhere.</p>

		<p>Did that Freedom Of Religion actually mean OTHER religions?  Such as Islamic, Santeria, or any other NON-Christian religions?  Or did it mean the different SECTS of Christianity ONLY?  Did our Founders ever envision that we would allow NONwhites to immigrate, flood our land and become citizens? Did they ever envision America to become a nation of different religions/peoples from all over the world?  My answer is NO, they did not. They knew better than anyone that nonwhites and their religions would destroy any nation they lived in. Why would any White Founders set up a nation for the whole world to invade and conquer? In other words, a United Nations of sorts? Sounds like a One Worlder dream come true.</p>

		<p> Interesting. But since our judicial system doesn&rsquo;t really follow the Constitution anymore I suppose sharia law being encoded in Amerikan law isn&rsquo;t as far fetched as we might like to think.<br>
If muslims want to be ruled under it then let them.</p>

There is already precedent.  I believe Hassidic Jewish law is already used in some courts where their is mutual consent to abide by it.   I understand that is the case in Britain and Canada also.<br>

		<p>Just who is &#8220;Supreme Court Justice Elena Kana&#8221;?  Funny, I can&rsquo;t find anybody by that name!  And that New Jersey case (which no one in New Jersey has heard of)?  Please tell us just who, when, and where.  Details please!   Let&rsquo;s have specifics.  Nor are the Ten Commandments the law of the land anywhere in the USA.  This garbled, misinformed  article [the original] is so poorly written it is pathetic.  <br>

		<p>I am actually quite surprised that ONLY 70% of Oklamoma&rsquo;s voters  voted to ban courts from adopting Sharia. That&rsquo;s only just over two-thirds.   I find that rather scary. It&rsquo;s getting uncomfortably close to 50%.  I&rsquo;m glad they defeated the measure, but  I would have expected 99.9% to have voted against Sharia. What is in the warped minds of those other 30%?  Are they Americans?</p>

		<p>Sooners are afraid of this:</p>
<p><i>ISLAMIC law has been officially adopted in Britain, with sharia courts given powers to rule on Muslim civil cases.</i></p>
<p><i>Rulings issued by a network of five sharia courts are enforceable with the full power of the judicial system, through the county courts or High Court.</i></p>
<p>Which leads to this, from the land that gave us the great twin gifts of Common Law and the Industrial Revolution:</p>
<p><i>it was revealed that a teenage stabbing case among the Somali community in Woolwich had been dealt with by a sharia &#8220;trial&#8221;.</i></p>
<p><i>a group of Somali youths were arrested by police on suspicion of stabbing another Somali teenager&hellip;.The victim&rsquo;s family told officers the matter would be settled out of court and the suspects were released on bail. A hearing was convened and elders ordered the assailants to compensate the victim.</i></p>
<p>But, Common Law is a reflection of white culture, certainly not Somalis, who I suspect lack the capacity to comprehend Common Law let alone its connection with liberty and private property rights and prosperity, let along adopt it as their own.</p>
<p>Goodbye England!  The land of John Locke, Christopher Wren, Charles Babbage,  William Caxton, Douglas Adams&hellip;.and The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, The Who, Queen&hellip;.for these things will not survive.  And neither will you if you are a White Briton.<br>
