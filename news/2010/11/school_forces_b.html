<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Stanislaus County school is forcing a student to take an American flag off of his bike.</p>
<p>Thirteen-year-old Cody Alicea put the flag there as a show of support for the veterans in his family.</p>
<p>But officials at Denair Middle School told him he couldn&rsquo;t fly it. He said he was told some students had complained.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His father, Robert Kisner, said his son should not have to put the flag away.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s got that flag on his bike because he&rsquo;s proud of where he comes from,&#8221; Kisner said.</p>
<p>But the superintendent said he&rsquo;s trying to avoid tension on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;(The) First Amendment is important,&#8221; Superintendent Edward Parraz said. &#8220;We want the kids to respect it, understand it, and with that comes a responsiblity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parraz said the campus has recently experienced some racial tension. He said some students got out of hand on Cinco de Mayo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Hispanic, you know, kids will, you know, bring their Mexican flags and they&rsquo;ll display it, and then of course the kids would do the American flag situation, and it does cause kind of a racial tension which we don&rsquo;t really want,&#8221; Parraz said. &#8220;We want them to appreciate the cultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parraz said if a disruption arises over a flag, they want it to be taken down to protect the safety of all students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Outside of the school, a large U.S. flag flies from atop a flagpole.</p>

		<p>My first thought on seeing the heading for this article was, I suppose some mildly naughty kid is displaying a Confederate Flag and upsetting the PC brigade. But to complain about displaying the National USA Flag is beyond belief. Just what is the currrent agenda in the USA?</p>
<p>People here proudly display the Australian flag on motor vehicles and even front gardens. In fact there seems to be even more pride than ever in the national flag these days. I think it may be something to do with the influx of Asians and Muslims here.</p>

		<p>Is it possible for these people to make a concise, well thought out statement without using &#8220;you know&#8221;. I am sure this is a high performing school district because, &#8220;you know&#8221;, the superintendent is so well spoken and skilled in using the English language.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Outside of the school, a large U.S. flag flies from atop a flagpole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oddly, even further outside the school grounds, the US flag also flies with predominance, as that is the country the school grounds are located in. Not Mexico, not China, not Zimbabwe, not Iran, and certainly not some UN utopia!</p>
<p>Frankly and laughably, when I originally glanced at this story on my Facebook page this morning, I thought it was another spoof alert by &ldquo;The Onion,&rdquo; which I subscribe to there. Now I come home and find out that it is a &ldquo;real news&rdquo; event, even if no less absurd.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>As always hope not to offend.</p>
<p>Quite honestly, i smell a rat on this whole situation. Yet another school seems appearantly afraid of Hispanics raising a riot over white society, and if they dislike it, go back to mexico! They need to have respect for the country that sits them here!</p>
<p>And if the school can&rsquo;t control riots here&rsquo;s an idea for the district: Gather all classes together for a meeting in the auditorium, and simply tell all students to freely express their faith and country as long as it&rsquo;s not insulting. </p>
<p>But i guess to this school, waving a flag on your bike will get you hurt (a.k.a expelled from school due to the districts fears of it being sued by a minority, and nothing whitey can do about it.)</p>

		<p>Of course, a Mexican flag is OK. The bigger the better. Especially if accompanied by a mob of brown people chanting &#8220;Down with whitey!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem flying that little flag, if there weren&rsquo;t a bunch of little mestizos CAUSING the trouble over the flag, would there?  Rather than tell the kid to remove the flag of HIS country from HIS bike, how about you/we remove the MESTIZOS from OUR country and back to theirs?  Sounds like a better solution all around to me.</p>

<p>This is America, NOT Mexico. If these kids want to fly their Mexican flags, then they should go home. This is why we shouldn&rsquo;t haven&rsquo;t allowed mass  immigration in the first place. Glad to see the American kids standing up for their flag. If racial tensions occur, it is the fault of those who have the arrogance to come to another country and fly their flag and get offended at the natives.</p>

		<p>A piece of ground or territory where it is dangerous to display the &#8220;national&#8221; flag no longer belongs to the nation in question.  Conquerors and rebels raise their flag over the territory they have conquered.  Much of the southwest is defacto Mexican territory.  We pay the bills but they own it and we must not kid ourselves.  And as Mexicans infiltrate the Carolinas, New York, Boston, etc. that territory becomes their&rsquo;s unless we forcibly retake it.  It is time to be realistic, the US no longer owns all the territory it claims.  And there is no taking a lot of it back despite the musings of White Nationalists.  Sometimes it is better to accept ones losses, regroup and start having babies so that EuroAmericans can have a future.  We could still reclaim the bulk of the country but all of it?  No way.</p>
<p>And we better decide to go into survival mode fast or we will end up like the Tibetans.<br>

		<p>1 Comment from Australia:</p>
<p>If there is an increased interest in the Australian flag among Aussies because of increased Asian and Muslim immigration, then that will be the exact reason the PC politburo/taliban pans and bans its display.  Especially since it contains the Union Jack, and I know that the PC crowd has been wanting to change the flag for years, in order to make it more &#8220;multicultural.&#8221;  Though voters turned down a new flag there about ten or so years ago.  The Union Jack has Scotland&rsquo;s version of the St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross integrated into it, and that&rsquo;s not a long step from the Confederate Battle Flag.</p>

		<p>All this guy wanted to do was show respect for the veterans in his family. Now even the flag of this country has been deemed as a cause of racial tension?</p>
<p>And how can we &#8220;appreciate&#8221; other cultures when the left is constantly degrading our own and telling us it&rsquo;s offensive? It&rsquo;s just going to cause more racial/cultural tension and hostility. And if these people are so offended by our flag, then why are they even here in the first place?</p>

		<p>I like the idea of gathering all the kids together for an assembly.  But what they should say is, &#8220;Tolerance and diversity go both ways.  You Mexican students cannot demand that no one display the American flag, while YOU are allowed to express all the ethnic and national pride that you please.  If you or your parents immigrated here from Mexico, that was your or their choice.  To come here and demand that our flag, the American flag, be removed from your sight is offensive arrogance and will not be tolerated.  American flags are permitted and encouraged on this campus.  Get over it.  Any student who complains about an American flag will be immediately expelled.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;I can dream.</p>

		<p>Look.  The bottom line is this is the United States of America.  If a kid can&rsquo;t have a US flag on his bike now, what&rsquo;s it going to be like in the future?  Does anyone really believe it&rsquo;s going to stop at some point?  - That the forces opposing us are going to say, &#8220;Okay guys, that&rsquo;s enough I think, we&rsquo;ve got our rights now&#8221;.  </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going push us to our graves, unless and until we wake up.</p>

		<p>If I were a parent of the child I would demand the child be able to bring the flag to school and use it the way he wants to. If the school refuses I&rsquo;ll immediately take the child off the place and spread by word-of-mouth the policies that school persists in so that more people will be aware on what it does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that Parraz ( who&rsquo;s obviously Hispanic ) should discourage a student who proudly uses the flag of the country Parraz currently resides in and benefits from. Perhaps a deal could be made. Cody takes down the flag and Parraz moves to another country. Fair?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stories like this that inevitably make one&rsquo;s blood boil. True Americans should put their foot down once and for all before the current madness becomes bloodier than it&rsquo;s supposed to.</p>

		<p>Surely instead of denying children their rights to the freedom of expression (speech) they should punish those who use violence against another? That&rsquo;s what surveillance cameras are for, right? After the first few students are expelled they&rsquo;ll be forced to rethink their strategy or face the same thing themselves.</p>
<p>P.S. As a European I struggle to understand why the U.S. celebrates &#8216;Cinco de Mayo&rsquo;, a Mexican holiday, while Mexico does not?</p>

		<p>James Edwards of TPC has said that if you allow people to ban the Confederate flag then a ban on the United States flag will soon follow.  He has been proved right.  This is not the first case where a person has been told not to fly the U.S. flag because it might upset those dear elements of the diversity who, although they have immigrated to the United States, often illegally, nonetheless hate the country and especially the white people in it and their ancestors who founded it.</p>

<p>Poster #16 mentioned the Cinco de Mayo thing, not being celebrated in Mexico, but here in the U.S.  It&rsquo;s just the creation of a new mythology and Mexican &#8220;American&#8221; identity.  In 20 years it will be a federal holiday and celebrated on the order of Thanksgiving. </p>

<p>They appreciate every culture but their own. They have exactly the opposite of appreciation for whites and their cultures. The website Stormfront was actually on the national news last night, with practically the word &#8216;Evil&rsquo; appearing beside their logo. Apparently, some internet watchdog group rated their website 4 out of 5 stars - until it was discovered What Stormfront was. It was national news and scandal that the group got a positive rating. Now that they know what Stormfront is, it&rsquo;s now filled with viruses, and bogus links or something? Ironically, if I was involved in Stormfront most likely I&rsquo;d assume they were all &#8216;Klanwatch&rsquo; operatives or FBI agents. And I assume I wouldn&rsquo;t like them, even if they were on the up and up - lol especially. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not a member I guess. Good thing we&rsquo;re on AmRen and the folks aren&rsquo;t simply more paid members working for team-diversity and working for a &#8216;better&rsquo; world.  </p>

This is what social doctrines of &ldquo;diversity and multiculturism&rdquo; leads to, especially applied to those who entered this country in violation of our immigration laws as many of those incensed over the American flag have likely done. This is what pandering and placating these people leads, the host culture and people cast aside in lieu of a third-world, militant culture who has no interest in multiculturism and diversity. </p>
<p>Mexico is one of the most racist and nationalistic countries on this planet. Why would you expect their illegals and anchor babies to behave any differently just because they cross our borders illegally.</p>
<p>In addition, the Superintendent Edward Parraz is hispanic, who seemingly has chosen to side with his raza instead of this country and our flag. Figures&hellip;.</p>

RE: Cinco de Mayo..I worked in a restaurant for awhile. The owners of the place liked Cinco de Mayo because the areas Mexicans would pack the house chock full. They only had that type of business on Mother&rsquo;s Day or maybe Valentine&rsquo;s Day. It was all about the dollars. Now, I can&rsquo;t say I blame them, they are in the business of making money, after all. I don&rsquo;t recall any special menu, or other types of pandering to get the area Mexicans to flood the place, they just did because it was a place to celebrate. That was 13 years ago in New England, things may have changed in that area since then.</p>
<p>As for flag issues, the only Mexican I met was an older man who had his front yard LINED with USA flags, and had a HUGE one flying from his house.It was almost comical. That is why it is so shocking to me to see Mexicans in other parts of the country flying Mexican flags. </p>

		<p>I looked up the demographics of Denair and was surprised to find this:</p>
<p>Hispanic/Latino: 	24.5%<br>
White*: 	71.4%</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think there were any communities left in California&rsquo;s San Joaquin Valley that had a significant White demographic   &mdash;    although, as I&rsquo;ve posted previously, California&rsquo;s definition of &#8216;White&rsquo; has changed to include those from the Middle East and North Africa ( I believe this change was brought about to pacify and convince us productive Euro-Americans in California that we aren&rsquo;t disappearing from California after all&hellip;.but I digress and it is a bit OT here).  </p>
<p>A Middle Eastern population <i>is</i> moving into California&rsquo;s Central Valley.  I see this when I visit elderly relatives that still live in the area. A Middle Eastern family recently bought a parcel of property in this area that had been in my mother&rsquo;s family, fallow, for almost 100 years.  Maybe they can get the Water Rights that my grandfather never could.</p>
<p>And the demographics of Denair Middle School where the incident took place:</p>
<p>Student Demographics:</p>
<p>Hispanic	 114   	 37.7%<br>
White	 180   	 59.6%</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>Special Programs</p>
<p>Free or Reduced Lunch  	 143   	 47.4%</p>
<p>(all Stats courtesy of Zipskinny.com, BTW)</p>
<p>Who do you suppose receives the Free/Reduced lunches?</p>
<p>Could it be the very ones who claim they are &#8216;offended&rsquo; by the sight of an American Flag?    Yeah, got their hands out for benefits, &#8216;rights&rsquo; and entitlements paid for by American Taxpayers, too stupid to make the connection as to where those benefits come from.</p>
<p>But, you can guess as to whom this demographic will blame when their entitlements and benefits are drastically reduced, and it&rsquo;s coming as the California legislature meets again this week to rectify a 6 billion dollar budget hole&hellip;.</p>
<p>In a future post I&rsquo;ll write about the condition and steep decline in the quality of Free School Lunches, what passes for &#8216;food&rsquo; these days.  Vile and disgusting.</p>

We are actually British with British passports although we have not lived there for 23 years having lived before in South Africa, escaping there in 1999.  When Spain was winning the FIFA soccer in South Africa or Rafael Nadal is/was winning the big tennis matches again, we hang large Spanish banners/flags from our balconies and display them from the car.  Our Spanish neighbours at first were bemused to find such enthusiasm and one asked if he could borrow one to celebrate with it on his car, but there are no rules here to say that any flags cannot be displayed at any time.  In Britain apparently there are many for the same stupid reasons as in the report above.  The usual jobsworths paid for with tax payer&rsquo;s money flexing their paper muscles as that is all they can do. If there are no legal rules against the show of pride in your country, then tell the petty people to go where it is very hot and I do not mean Mexico.  A concerted stand needs to be made by all against the &#8220;globalisation advocates&#8221; who see a future where they are in power with more power to dictate to all.</p>

		<p>Do you notice how  *ALL*  the &#8220;officially-recognized&#8221; minorities (blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, atheists, homosexuals) use the same tactics?  (And yet other minorities   &mdash;  like Asians &amp; the Amish, etc  &mdash;   don&rsquo;t feel the need to use the same social blackmail to ensure that their members get &#8220;their fair share&#8221; from the public trough&hellip;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Community leaders&#8221; (= grievance-mongers) show up and claim that such-and-such formerly normal, traditional, mainstream behavior will cause members of their special victimology group to feel ostracized, or singled-out, or will cause them to be ridiculed or criticized, or will violate their assumed civil right to be treated like normal-citizens-with-normal-rights-&-responsibilities (even though their whole basis for claiming victim status is that they are a separate, special, group that IS distinct from &#8220;the rest of society&#8221; and therefore DESERVES special rights and fewer responsibilities).  And every time, The-Powers-That-Be fall for the extortion; and every time, We-The-Public have to constrain ourselves to as not to damage the victim-group&rsquo;s &#8220;special sensibilities&#8221; regarding our flag, or printing turban-bomb cartoons, or posting the Ten Commandments in public places.  We can&rsquo;t even rebuke gay-&#8220;rights&#8221; provocateurs who deliberately try to offend us with inappropriate public displays of gropery.  </p>
<p>God help the country, because our leaders (EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM!) seem to have abandoned the common sense the Good Lord presumably gives even to invertebrates.</p>
<p>(At least the gays and atheists haven&rsquo;t yet gotten to the point that their community-extortion-practitioners hint that their &#8220;more extreme members&#8221; will go out and riot in the streets if this one, teensy, insignificant accommodation to their victim-group isn&rsquo;t immediately forthcoming.)</p>

<p>The flag must never be touched except by the winds that unfurl it for all to see.  And the hands that lift it high to keep us free.</p>
<p>He would not approve of putting it on a bike where it could contact a tire and get dirty while tripping up the rider.</p>
<p>Nor of leaving it unattended where it could get wet by rain or &#8216;bumped&rsquo; by negiligent ignorance.</p>
<p>Nor stuffing it into a backpack, crushed by books and school supplies where it could be forced to the ground, no matter how well folded.</p>
<p>He would also have serious problems with a school that illuminated the California State flag, but not Ol&rsquo; Glory above it.</p>
<p>But for all that, there would be polar bears ice skating in Baja before he would let it be taken down to &#8216;avoid racial tensions&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8221; did NOT allow mass immigration.  In 1965 we were promised by Senator Ted Kennedy and every major pundit in the country that the changes to the existing immigration law would NOT change racial and ethnic balances in the U.S.</p>

<p>Yes, it is true that so many Whites do not care whatsoever. But WE do here on Amren and other racially aware sites. I listened to a Cornerstone pastor today on radio(he has a talk radio show for 2 hours every week-end. HE is part of the problem we face. He also has a huge congregation of &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; He was talking about this today and his conclusion is that America is for people all over the globe (which it was never meant to be) and we are all &#8220;Americans&#8221; and the mexicans at that school need to assimilate and become part of the &#8220;melting pot&#8221;. He is wrong on all counts.</p>
<p> He says America is a COUNTRY, not a culture (race). Oh, really? Anyone (all races) can be an American he says, and we can all become one. Wrong again on all counts. </p>
<p> Only White European nationalities can assimilate and become one, because we are all ONE race! Even our Founders understood this very well. Something that pastor and most pastors will never admit, I am afraid.</p>

<p>I disagree. An American is someone who holds a valid citizenship of the United States of America irrespective of his/her/it&rsquo;s race, religion or regional origins. The word American does NOT denote a race or ethnicity but simply a nationality to a region or nation in continental North America. Wheras to be German or British / English / Italian/ French / Polish / Russian etc is both a nationality and a race / ethnicity. However, you cannot equate the same with being an American.<br>
Also this idea of Pan-white European oneness is luducrous. It never worked in the past when whites had all the power, it sure won&rsquo;t work in the present and future too. Just because you see other races being hostile to your interests, don&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t expect intra-racial hostility considering the fact that European ethncities have a lot of diversity too.</p>

<p>You really believe that? What do you consider a VALID citizenship? The bogus piece of paper the traitors in government hands over to anyone and everyone in the world and of other races? </p>
<p>Have you not noticed when this nation was founded that it was ONLY White Europeans that became citizens? Did you not notice that the Founders were addressing ONLY White peoples? Did you not notice that when &#8220;equality among men&#8221; were meant for Whites whom they were addressing at that time? Did you not notice that when it was said &#8220;for our PROGENY&#8221; that means only one thing? Who are or ever could be, the Founders progeny? Blacks, Asians, Mexicans, Arabs, etc? You must think our Founders were pretty stupid NOT to know the difference among RACES. </p>
<p> As for your contention that &#8220;European ethncities have a lot of diversity too.&#8221; </p>
<p>WHAT?  Of course they do! You equate &#8220;diversity&#8221; among Euros as being the same as &#8220;diversity&#8221; among DIFFERENT races? </p>
<p>NO!!!!!</p>
<p>The REASON that Euros could come together from different nations and can become one is BECAUSE they are of the same RACE! They are not different races! If you cannot open your eyes and SEE the different races and what they have done to this country and to our people, then I feel sorry for you. EVERY NONwhite race has their own NATIONS, except for the WHITE race!  Doesn&rsquo;t that tell you something?</p>

		<p>This has been happening in Europe for some time now. Displaying the flag of your country is supposed to be a &#8220;far-right&#8221; statement, a form of hate speech, and, first and foremost, an anti-immigration symbol.</p>
<p>The situation verges on the absurd in the United Kingdom, where a motorist was stopped by a policeman once, and ordered to remove the Union Jack from his rear window.</p>
<p>In France, flags have been forcibly removed from city council buildings, to be replaced with the flag of Algeria or Morocco. The wedding party of a soldier&rsquo;s family has been assaulted by a group of Arabs, because they were waving French flags from their cars. </p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s Algerians or Moroccans having a wedding party, they routinely deploy noisy motorcades, waving huge flags of their country, honking and deliberately holding up traffic.</p>

		<p>Cinco de Mayo became such a big thing because Hispanics in the California state college system saw that there was no mileage in protesting on Mexican independence day since that fell outside the school year. They settled on Cinco de Mayo for reasons of convenience.</p>
<p>What some may not realize is that many American Hispanics who agitate so much for their culture and language rights are third generation Americans who can&rsquo;t communicate that well in Spanish. They simply recognize that special privileges come with being Hispanic. </p>

<p>Yeah but those Pakis and Algerians are NOT British or European in ethno-racial sense because to be a German, I would have to be an etnnic White ( Non-Jewish) German or European white gentile.

		<p>What is meant by an &#8220;American&#8221;?  What does the word mean?<br>
There&rsquo;s a lot of wrangling goin on here over that. It&rsquo;s not surpriseing because the word&rsquo;s meaning is undergoing re-definition even as we speak. It has been going especially  since 1965, when the hordes of the Third World were unleashed on us.</p>
<p>Poster #31 says, <i>&#8220;An American is someone who holds valid citizenship of the United States of America irrespective of his/her/it&rsquo;s race, religion or regional origins. The word American does NOT denote a race or ethnicity but simply [citizenship].&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I do not like that definition at all, but I must reluctantly agree that, technically, if you are fillihg out a form, as for a passport, that definition is what now applies. At least officially.  But that&rsquo;s not my personal definition.</p>
<p>Up until 1965 (and even after), we knew quite clearly what an American was. At that point the notion came into vogue that &#8220;anyone can be an American.&#8221; It&rsquo;s simply what&rsquo;s written on your official papers. What your birth certificate and passport say. I remember a Chinese man remarking in the 80&rsquo;s how uncertain the word had become, that formerly everyone understood exactly what was (or wasn&rsquo;t) an &#8220;American&#8221;.  But by then, anybody could be an American. </p>
<p>The word has been undergoing transformation  througout the 20th Century. Madame Butterfly is an excellent example of this; it gives us  a cultural attitude preserved in art.  The concept of what an &#8220;American&#8221; once was, when the founding race and culture still prevailed.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, at the time Madame Butterfuly was composed (1904),  there was no doubt at all about the race and ethnic type of an &#8220;American&#8221;.   Lieutenant Pinkerton, an American officer in Japan, was a real  American beyond any doubt.  An &#8220;American&#8221; in the fullest sense: racially, ethnically, as well as citizenship-wise.  Butterfly was Japanese. While there did take place a romance between them  (for her, a mere dalliance for him), it was unthinkable that he would marry her and bring her home.  The USA was for whites only, and respectable whites did not marry non-whites  (much less import them!). It would have been the end of his Naval career, and he would have been  socially ostracized by all the people he knew. It was out of the question! So he returned to the US and married his old sweetheart, Kate, leaving pathetic Butterfly abandoned. </p>
<p>Madame Butterfly was written by an Italian, Puccini. But note that he purposely made Pinkerton&rsquo;s name about as Anglo-sounding as he could  get  (while not being a Jackson, Washington, or Jefferson, if you get my meaning, since those have been claimed by another race). That&rsquo;s no accident.  It was not Lt. Suarez or Wong or Patel,   or Obongo or Obama or AlMustafa.  Nor was it Lt. Leroy Brown or  DeShawntavious Jefferson.  </p>
<p>In other words, Puccini, a foreigner, knew more clearly back then what an American was than we do today.  Since then, we have become very muddled and confused.  Now, all those Patels and Wongs claim to be Americans, every bit as much as you, encouraged to think so by our government which has completely sold out its founding population.</p>
<p>I wonder what &#8220;American&#8221; will mean in 2050?  Perhaps it will have no meaning at all. Perhaps nationalities by then will have been abolished, forbidden as hate speech?</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t understand. YOU may consider  a German as someone who is of White German ethnicity, but in Western Europe, many consider anybody with legal citizenship as German, even if they are Turks or whatever. The Brits, many of them, consider anyone with British citizenship be they of Pakistani or whatever as British same as a White. At least that is what they say it should be. Before 1965, an American was someone who was White though there were a small amount of other non-Whites considered American. </p>

<p><br>
Yes.  There were black Americans and  American Indians. <br>
Even a few Chinese and miscellaneous others.  But they were the exception, not the rule. The standard &#8220;American&#8221; was white, and that&rsquo;s what the word was assumed to mean.</p>
<p>Look at old Hollywood movies for a good example of this. Hollywood had stars of various ethnicities from around the world: Carmen Miranda, Ricardo Montalban, Dorothy Dandridge, Turhan Bey, Anna Mae Wong, etc.  They were treated well and respectfully.  They had their careers and they made their fortunes;  but they were still considered exotics, not quite &#8220;Americans&#8221;.</p>
<p>John Wayne, Bing Crosby, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Ginger Rodgers   &mdash;   they were the &#8220;Americans&#8221; and they had the starring roles; the others merely added foreign &#8220;spice&#8221; and were generally backups to the star. </p>
<p>After 1945, Hollywood went international and started making pictures in cheaper, war-torn Europe, using many European stars and international casts    &mdash;   Deborah Kerr, Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot, etc, (not that it hadn&rsquo;t used Europeans before)&hellip;but it still confined them to white. Even when a non-white was to be portrayed, Hollywood used a white actor for the role (Yul Brynner). Today, that would draw howls of protest from the minority special interest groups. In those days, Hollywood didn&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>Descriptive terms like &#8220;German&#8221; have come to have two meanings.<br>
There is much confusion. </p>
<p>One refers to legal citizenship, nothing more.<br>

In this increasingly mixed-up world, they are not always the same. </p>

<p>Hey, if America, American society and its flag are all so bad, why don&rsquo;t they simply head back for Mexico? Over there, they&rsquo;ll be bale to wave their mexican flags all over the place, without having to deal with the Stars and Stripes, I imagine&hellip;</p>
<p>The US is still the US, and not some Mexican province, right?</p>
<p>The arrogance, and refusal to assimilate, of those people, is quite simply provocative.</p>
