<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/15/europe-immigration-far-right-threat">Far-Right Fringe Exploits European Coalitions</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Traynor, Guardian (London), Nov. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Europe&rsquo;s mainstream political parties are engaged in a worsening feud over how to deal with the growing power of extreme rightwing anti-immigrant movements. Amid a backlash against immigration that has shaken Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden in recent months, governments of the centre-right or centre-left appear at a loss to counter the appeal of extremist populists who have moved from the madcap fringes of national politics into government, or propping up minority centrist coalitions.</p>
<p>A liberals-led coalition has just taken office in the Netherlands dependent on the parliamentary support of Geert Wilders, Europe&rsquo;s leading Islam-baiter. In Denmark, another liberals-led government also relies on the anti-immigrant nationalists of the Danish People&rsquo;s Party for survival. Last week, the DPP won a tightening of the most draconian immigration laws in Europe in return for agreeing to the government&rsquo;s budget for next year.</p>
<p>Alarmed at the growing appeal of the far right, leaders of the centre-right and centre-left are struggling to form a coherent response. Attempts to construct a cross-party European anti-extremism pact are falling victim to the expediencies of national politics. &#8220;This is becoming a very hot political issue,&#8221; said a spokesman for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a large grouping in the European parliament.</p>
<p>Last week Wilfried Martens, a former Belgian prime minister who leads the European People&rsquo;s party which groups ruling Christian democrats in most of the EU, made approaches to social democrat and liberal leaders with the aim of forging a joint anti-extremist position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martens wants a common approach of the political parties,&#8221; said his spokesman, Kostas Sasmatzoglou. &#8220;The phenomenon is growing and these far-right parties are getting stronger and stronger. We all face the same issue, but we should not be trying to score political points.&#8221;</p>
<p>The overture looks doomed. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t see a solution in going hand-in-hand with the conservative parties,&#8221; said Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the former Danish prime minister who heads the pan-European association of social democratic parties, the Party of European Socialists (PES). &#8220;The conservatives are saying, &#8216;If you can&rsquo;t beat the far right, join them,&rsquo;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Leading social democrats are to meet in Budapest on Wednesday to issue an appeal against deal-making with the far right. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not about a cordon sanitaire,&#8221; said Rasmussen, referring to past failed policies of ostracising and ignoring the populists, particularly in Belgium and Austria. &#8220;It&rsquo;s about confronting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Europe&rsquo;s social democrats endorsed a policy ruling out coalitions or electoral pacts &#8220;with a party inciting or attempting to stir up racial or ethnic prejudices and racial hatred at European or national levels&#8221;. The policy also rejected the forging of tacit parliamentary alliances with such parties, and the adoption of far- right policies that are proving popular. It demanded that all mainstream parties sign up to the principles.</p>
<p>But conservatives and liberals are already in bed with the far right in Denmark, Netherlands, and Italy. &#8220;We can&rsquo;t dictate or intervene in domestic politics,&#8221; said Sasmatzoglou for the centre-right. &#8220;They are all different situations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Critics say that until earlier this year, Rasmussen and the PES were supporting a centre-left government in Slovakia that was in coalition with the extreme Slovak National party. Last week Turkey&rsquo;s ambassador in Vienna denounced Austria&rsquo;s governing social democrats for being too timid to attack the militant and increasingly popular anti-Muslim policies of the far-right Freedom party.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a strong need for real political leadership to resist the &#8216;fortress Europe&rsquo; temptation and to avoid extremism and demagogy,&#8221; said Cecilia Malmstr√∂m, the European commissioner for home affairs. &#8220;In a time of economic crisis, migrants are among the most vulnerable groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>The centre-left is losing support across Europe to the extreme right. Recent gains for the extremists have been at the expense of Sweden&rsquo;s and Austria&rsquo;s social democratic parties and the Dutch Labour party, with the far right prospering in cities with significant immigrant populations that traditionally voted for the left.</p>
<p>The anti-immigrant policy gains made in recent months look likely to continue. In Switzerland polls show majority support for a referendum this month demanding summary deportation of foreigners sentenced for petty crimes, not just for more serious crimes as up till now. The plebiscite is being organised by the rightwing Swiss People&rsquo;s party, which a year ago won another referendum banning minarets.</p>
<p>In France there are growing calls within President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s centre-right UMP party for a merger with Jean-Marie Le Pen&rsquo;s National Front. A poll last month showed one-third of UMP voters backed joint electoral pacts with the National Front. In Italy, where Silvio Berlusconi is in coalition with the far-right Northern League, the interior minister has announced a new crackdown on expelling EU citizens who cannot support themselves, a policy aimed at east European Roma and aping Sarkozy&rsquo;s summer expulsions in France. Denmark&rsquo;s tightened immigration laws should deploy a new weapon  &mdash;  bare breasts  &mdash;  to deter newcomers, the far-right People&rsquo;s party said last week. A documentary film on Denmark that is shown to immigrants as part of the test for entry should include topless bathers, said Peter Skaarup, the party&rsquo;s foreign affairs spokesman. &#8220;If you&rsquo;re coming from a strict, religious society that might make you stop and think: &#8216;Oh no,&rsquo;&#8221; he told the newspaper, Jyllands-Posten. &#8220;Topless bathing probably isn&rsquo;t a common sight on Pakistani beaches. I honestly believe &#8220;<br>

		<p>People get pushed to the extremes when there seems to be no other choice, when survival is so tenuous that anything but the current system is worth a try.  Most people do not have a great desire to be presidents or generals or kings, they just want to live their lives and raise their families.  As long as the system, whatever it may be, allows that most people will go along.  When the system causes mass misery, such as the waning days of Imperial China, or the Soviet Union, or Weimar Germany and enough people say &#8220;enough&#8221; the system collapses.  This is why the governments of Rhodesia and South Africa had to be overthrown from the outside.  The majority of people, including most blacks, were happy having plenty to eat and the security to walk the streets.  </p>
<p>Europe today is experiencing a different kind of loss.  Granted we are not talking about a lack of food or fuel or housing but the loss of perhaps something more precious: freedom of thought, expression, movement and religion.  Western Europeans for the first time since the 18th century are seeing their people being imprisoned for saying things a foreign group doesn&rsquo;t like.  They are seeing huge swaths of their territory become &#8220;no go&#8221; zones due to foreign occupation.  Religious tolerance is coming to an end.  And the main stream politicians are supporting all of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the 20th century it won&rsquo;t be starvation and domestic oppression that will bring down governments but the imposition of alien cultures by the main stream politicians.  One can only hope that the Europeans are waking up and will take action before too big of a blood bath is required to reclaim their heritage.<br>

<p>Americans should be aware that most people in Europe who vote for the &#8220;extreme&#8221; right are people who previously voted for leftist/socialist parties or their children, not people who previously voted for conservative/capitialist parties.  </p>

		<p>There are two problems with the notion that the lamestream leftist and lamestream rightist parties can join together in a big kumbaya to defeat sane Patriots, those problems constitute a Catch-22 will make such a coalition impossible to coalesce, much less hold together:</p>
<p>1.  The lamestream leftist parties already think (or want their own base of voters to think) the lamestream conservative parties are the same kind of &#8220;racists&#8221; as the &#8220;far right&#8221; they&rsquo;re supposed to join together to &#8220;combat.&#8221;  Should the lamer left join with the lamer right, then the most loyal members of the lamer left parties, racial minorities, who are goaded year in and year out to vote the lamer left party to combat the &#8220;white racism&#8221; of the lamer right party are going to wonder why their party all of a sudden wants to join hands with the &#8220;white racist&#8221; lamer right party to fight some other party&rsquo;s &#8220;white racism.&#8221;  It would be like the American 3rd Position Party actually becoming a political party and becoming serious and credible in the American body politic   &mdash;   If the Democrats and Republicans &#8220;get together&#8221; to combat A3P because of its &#8220;white racism,&#8221; then I&rsquo;m sure most black voters, who are Democrats because of the Republican Party&rsquo;s &#8220;white racism,&#8221; will be confoosled.  (Most already are, but that&rsquo;s beside the point.)</p>
<p>2.  The lamer left and lamer right can&rsquo;t formally join together  without confirming the suspicion held among many voters that both lamer parties are merely two appendages of the same bad ole ugly system.  So if they join, then sane white voters who might necessarily be 100% consumed with nationalism on a daily basis will finally get the message that there really is only one part, the Republocrats (in American parlance), or the LibLabCons (British), or LibLabs (Australian), and so on.  Therefore, they&rsquo;ll know that the only way to beat the system is to vote for the nationalist parties.  Therefore, the lamer left and lamer right parties need to stay separated (either in reality, or for outward consumption) in order to perpetuate the long time good cop bad cop bad cop good cop game which the ruling elite really depend upon to remain ruling elites.  </p>

		<p>Change is in the air and if it&rsquo;s to go forward, the forces of change will have to refer to Russia as a model for change to avoid being associated with the usual failed WW2 symbolism and capture a solid voter majority or remain in coalitions that keep them permanently from implementing their political program fully. Wilders is not pro-Russian while Le Pen and Liga Norda are and the Freedom Party seems neutral. </p>

		<p> Leave it to the Guardian to moan and wring its hands because a significant number of Europeans care enough about their societies and culture to support &#8220;far-Right&#8221; and &#8220;extremist&#8221; parties.</p>
<p> The Left and Center in European politics are taking the same head-in-the-sand attitude that lost the recent off-year election for the Democrats in the U.S. Instead of trying to understand why Europeans are so concerned and upset about the massive invasion of non-European immigrants, they simply dismiss such concerns as &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;extremism,&#8221; and vie with each other in issuing impassioned vows not to cooperate with said &#8220;extremists.&#8221;</p>
<p> Then, often, they wind up having to eat their words. It serves them right. </p>

<p>The &ldquo;centre-left&rdquo; is losing support because it is just like the &ldquo;center-right&rdquo; and the far-left Marxists, they are a pack of mystified multicultural loons and thugs, or just plain loony thugs. They have refused to see the colonization of their countries and continent by hostile and grasping invaders, as anything but a threat. They purposefully ignore nonwhite: riot, rape, pillage, and murder, as being wrong or destructive, but instead make a fanciful fetish of it and call it &ldquo;enriching.&rdquo; This is why they are losing and will continue to do so; it is a hard fact of reality, nonwhites cannot function productively in a white society because they are: alien, abusive, and absurdly arrogant.</p>
<p>In this respect, they do conform to the old ruling &ldquo;elites&rsquo;&rdquo; standards of decorum, but no one else&rsquo;s. Particularly those who pay the taxes and actually do the work. </p>
<p>Utopias based on &ldquo;economic equality&rdquo; are laughable; utopias based on &ldquo;racial equality&rdquo; are beyond anything of humor, and are simply macabre disgraces.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>What they really fear is the &#8220;far right&#8221;(i.e. anti-immigrant) attaining &#8220;faction status&#8221; in the EU parliament. This would mean a windfall of EU party financing and, of course, a wee bit more influence; and it is within reach.</p>

		<p>Just as in the U.S., third-worlders have swarmed into Europe, and welfare and crime have soared.  Of course, the left will accuse the right of racial and ethnic hatred when most of the concern is related to economic and security matters.  <br>
While the U.S. doesn&rsquo;t form parliamentary-style coalitions, certain factions have historically bonded in order to make gains.  Far-left intellectuals and common workers have done so for decades in the Democratic Party, but lately the coalition is breaking down due to the former&rsquo;s placing of gay and illegal alien demands as priorities.  Since Obama&rsquo;s campaign they have spoken of a party purge (without actually using that term) that would result in a far-left core.  It&rsquo;s a deluded notion, but they continue in their rationalization, while more moderates and conservatives move into the GOP. </p>

		<p>The Guardian is a left-wing politically-correct rag and the right-wing extremists this Red totalitarian so-called journalist prattles on about, are nothing more than ordinary people throughout the length and breadth of Europe, utterly sick of being lied to by the Marxist/globalist political elite. In the UK the Lib/Lab/Con one-party-with-three-names are fervent proponents of the EU and globalism, using multiculturalism/mass immigration to flood the UK with Third World immigrants, even expanding the postal voting system to gain thousands of fraudulent Third World votes through a now-corrupted voting system. </p>
<p>The EU is controlled by about two dozen appointed not elected EU Commissioners &amp; the Commissioner President is none other than Manuel Barroso, former leader of the Marxist Party in Portugal who is an &#8220;ex-Marxist&#8221; as are many other EU politicians along with Socialists (in this case a euphemism for Marxists) and Greens (Green is the new Red). Apart from about 60-70 nationalist politicians, the MEPs in the EU Parliament are only there to rubber-stamp the legislation proposed by the Commissioners. MEPs (if they&rsquo;re lucky) get only a paltry few minutes to speak on any pending legislation which passes hundreds of laws each day on an almost assembly-line basis. </p>
<p>Yes, Marxists have utter contempt for democracy and those people who dare oppose the Marxist EUSSR are demonised by their controlled media stooges and the whole Marxist/globalist Establishment who dumb-down the population in order to maintain their totalitarian status quo. But, the Truth cannot be concealed for ever, and, thanks to the Internet, millions of patriots in Europe are seeing through the World of Lies of the Marxist/globalist brainwashers who seek to destroy white-majority nation-states and are using multicultural/mass immigration to increase the powers of the EU Federal Superstate &amp; ultimately totalitarian One-world government.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the EU is the world&rsquo;s largest gravy-train, deliberately created that way so that many of its politicians (who keep being elected by the dumbed-down voters)can&rsquo;t resist the lavish expenses, perks &amp; funding grants that are available from the EU monster, thus compromising many of its politicians who, instead of looking after their people, instead turn a blind eye as each and every day their nation-states are further subsumed into the vice-like grip of the multicultural EU Federal Superstate. </p>

 Anyone daring to put forward an anti-immigration platform is always derided as &#8216;populist&rsquo;, &#8216;populist&rsquo; this, &#8216;populist&rsquo; that.Strange how the word is never, ever uttered except in the context of the biased media lambasting an anti-immigration platform.<br>
 Where do they keep that word in storage when it is not needed?<br>
Anyhow, is there any real distinction (apart from in the minds of popmpous &#8216;left-leaning&rsquo; journalists), between the word &#8216;populist&rsquo; and &#8216;democratic&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Your post and this article reminded me of something that&rsquo;s perhaps a bit OT.  &#8220;Populism&#8221; seems to be a compliment in the U.S., but a pejorative every where else.  It&rsquo;s the opposite of &#8220;socialism,&#8221; which is a pejorative here but neutral to complimentary everywhere else.  Anyone have any theories on that?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Populist&#8221; simply means of the people.  Well, what is wrong with that?  (Apparently The socialist Guardian thinks it&rsquo;s something pretty awful.)</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily a compliment here in the USA   &mdash;   at least not when used by Marxist lefties, who march in lockstep with their European counterparts.  </p>
<p>The word does not necessarily carry   the same historical connotations in North America as in Europe or  in South America.  In the US, it can have overtones of demagoguery or fascism,  and is  &#8220;tainted&#8221; by its association with ruralism, nativism, immigration restriction, social darwinism, and white supremacy;  as well as with Father Caughlin, George Wallace,  David Duke &hellip;.  thus deplored by the  wiser-than-thou Marxist  elites who presume to know best what is good for the humble masses.  They want  no  interference from the ignorant proletariat or its spokespersons.   </p>
<p>Both left and right have been associated with populism. But the American left tends to be leery of it, because of associations with the K in the US, the Nazis in Germany, even with Duke who ran as a Populist in 1988.    And because of its close link to Nativism, a special  bugaboo  of the Left.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it bizarre how journalists,  who are all for &#8220;people&rsquo;s this&#8221; and &#8220;people&rsquo;s that&#8221;&hellip; are shocked and repelled by Populism?  How dare  The People speak up for themselves! </p>
<p>  <i>&#8220;Scholars such as Richard Hofstadter portrayed the Populist movement as an irrational response of backward-looking farmers to the challenges of modernity. He &hellip;argued that Populists were provincial, conspiracy-minded, and had a tendency toward scapegoatism that manifested itself as nativism, anti-Semitism, anti-intellectualism, and Anglophobia. The antithesis of anti-modern Populism was modernizing Progressivism&#8221;  </i>  [Wiki]<br>

<p>This left-right stuff all gets so complicated!  It depends how you use what word with whom.  One man&rsquo;s compliment is another man&rsquo;s insult.</p>

<p>Indeed they are, paisan. Think of it. The world is so different - I might even use the word &#8220;diverse&#8221;- in so many ways, not the least of which are geophysical, cultural, political, demographical and financial.</p>
<p>Does anyone seriously expect a hunter-gatherer in Papua New Guinea to achieve economic equality with a Japanese industrialist? How about a Nigerian farmer with a Manhattan stockbroker? Or an Eskimo seal hunter with an American baseball player?</p>
<p>A child can figure out that the nearly 7 billion people on planet Earth will NEVER be economically equal to one another. So why do the idealists pursue this chimera of &#8220;economic equality&#8221; with the same fervor a lothario pursues a woman? </p>

<p>For the same reason that persistent lothario thinks he has a chance   &mdash;   they refuse to face reality!</p>
<p>These people are operating out of their hopes and wishes, not realism.  A lot of people (particularly third world types) don&rsquo;t like reallity, if it conflicts with what they want. They prefer to hear what they want to hear.</p>
