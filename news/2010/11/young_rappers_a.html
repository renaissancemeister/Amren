<h1>Young Rappers Arrested in Iran</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reza Sayeh, CNN, Nov. 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police in Tehran have arrested several members of underground Iranian rap groups, the semi-official ILNA news agency reported.</p>
<p>{snip}.</p>
<p>Police raided the homes, arrested the young musicians and confiscated &#8220;western style musical instruments&#8221; and several bottles of liquor, according to ILNA.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;These groups use the most trashy, juvenile and street-like words and phrases that have no place in proper grammar,&#8221; the police chief told ILNA. &#8220;More importantly, they have no regard for the law, principles, proper behavior and language.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Iran, rap and rock music is not a serious crime but is considered un-Islamic. Ignoring the laws against playing rap and rock music can lead to accusations of Satan worship and sentences of flogging or a night in jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sajedinia accused Iran&rsquo;s underground rap scene of spreading profanity and poisoning young minds. He called for an increase in traditional Iranian music to counter the influence of rap music, ILNA reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who have been arrested are among those who have veered away from proper behavior, who have distanced themselves from all of life&rsquo;s hardships and are in search of comforts that have no limits,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>No, Iran&rsquo;s brand of Islam is not for me. But for the life of me, I really don&rsquo;t know why they are considered an enemy of the US. Their enemies in general are not people I particularly like either.</p>

		<p>  While I don&rsquo;t like the current government of Iran, I certainly understand their motivation in prosecuting American style rap artists. I don&rsquo;t approve but I understand.</p>

		<p>A sane assessment by the Iranian mainstream. Reminds me of how the Russian govt banned Emo counter-culture in its schools for the same reasons. Hip-hop isn&rsquo;t a problem there.</p>

		<p>Anyone remember &#8216;WKRP In Cincinnati&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Remember the episode where the white station manager got a little edgy when his visiting baby sister started getting close to the black DJ?  And then he turns around and looks at the drugged out ex-hippy from the sixties who was -supposed- to be her escort/tour guide or whatever and supposedly realizes what a fool he&rsquo;s been?</p>
<p>The black guy reads his guilty expression, gets all hip and says something like: &#8220;Naw, man that&rsquo;s not prejudice, that&rsquo;s just good taste&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey Iran!  I&rsquo;m raising a glass of something illegal in your country in a generally eastwards direction. </p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t favor censorship of music (even allowing for the fact that rap barely meets the definition of &#8220;music&#8221;) what I don&rsquo;t understand is what draws people to rap when there is so much genuinely beautiful music out there, some created very recently and some many centuries old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised that the American media promotes rap, as the American media promotes anything that debases our culture.<br>

		<p>This is none of our business.  Let the Iranians run Iran.  I wish Americans (the pre1965 white population) had been allowed to run America, we would have been so much better off.</p>

		<p>Almost all of the comments that accompany the article think that these Iranian &#8220;rappers&#8221; are actually going to spearhead a revolution against Iran&rsquo;s theocratic regime. They criticize the West for being anti-Islamic, but they themselves slam the mullahs.</p>

		<p>Well, I know that Iran isn&rsquo;t the most popular country on the face of the Earth at the moment, but they sure do know how to deal with their riff-raff!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These groups use the most trashy, juvenile and street-like words and phrases that have no place in proper grammar,&rdquo; the police chief told ILNA. &ldquo;More importantly, they have no regard for the law, principles, proper behavior and language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A succinct appraisal of this ridiculous &#8216;musical&rsquo; genre. When the man&rsquo;s right - he&rsquo;s right! Couldn&rsquo;t have put it better myself! </p>
<p>&#8220;In Iran, rap and rock music is not a serious crime but is considered un-Islamic. Ignoring the laws against playing rap and rock music can lead to accusations of Satan worship and sentences of flogging or a night in jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solitary confinement I hope!<br>
I only wish our government down here in Australia applied such strict measures years ago to halt the spread of the hip-hop virus.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Hey Iran! I&rsquo;m raising a glass of something illegal in your country in a generally eastwards direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>So am I - right now! Here&rsquo;s cheers!</p>

<p>Absolutely correct.  Even without hate laws, such a statement uttered by an official here in the west would likely spark an immediate reaction from the public and result in that official being fired or given another punishment for using &#8220;insensitive and harmful&#8221; language.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re probably going to cane or whip these rappers, too.</p>
<p>A pity we can&rsquo;t do that here.</p>
