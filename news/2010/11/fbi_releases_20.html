	Today, the <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">FBI</span>
 released 2009  statistics which indicated that 6,604 criminal incidents
 involving 7,789  offenses were reported as a result of bias toward a 
particular race, religion,  sexual orientation, ethnicity/national 
origin, or physical or mental  disability. <i><span class="highlightedSearchTerm">Hate</span> <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">Crime</span> Statistics, 2009</i>,  published by the <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">FBI</span>&rsquo;s Uniform <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">Crime</span> Reporting Program, includes data from <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">hate</span>  <span class="highlightedSearchTerm">crime</span> reports submitted by law enforcement agencies throughout the nation.<div id="parent-fieldname-text" class="plain">

 by a racial bias,  19.7 percent were motivated by a religious bias, 
18.5 percent were motivated by  a sexual-orientation bias, and 11.8

		<p>Most of the mainstream news coverage of this story involves someone (NOT from the SPLC, amazingly) warning us not to read too much into the drop in hate crimes, because of &#8220;incomplete&#8221; or &#8220;flawed&#8221; data.  I agree   &mdash;   The data are flawed and incomplete because hate crime stats rarely includes crimes where whites are victims, because law enforcement rarely pursues hate crimes riders when whites are victims and the evidence for hate is easily found.</p>

		<p>To this day I do not understand how the government can count latinos as a separate group for set asides, minority affirmative action stuff, etc. but then count that mexican indian as a &#8216;white&rsquo; in crime statistics.

<p>Robbery, burglary, theft, MV theft, and other offenses are now classified as &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo;? I would like to know how each of these crimes were deemed &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo;.</p>

<p>What were the percentages for whites, black, and various races from previous years? I know that Hispanics are classified in this report as &#8216;white&rsquo; but I want to know how the percentages have changed from year to year.</p>
<p>Even including Hispanics as white, 62.4% seems high.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;There were 4,793 hate crime offenses classified as crimes against persons in 2009.

<p>Verbal &#8216;assaults&rsquo;, pushing, shoving, and fights. I noticed that they didn&rsquo;t break down the 9 forcible rapes and 8 murders by race.<br>

		<p>The black percentage of inter-racial bias, intimidation and harassment in this report is useless, because the local corrupt authorities in every locale WILL NOT classify hate crimes against whites as hate crimes, because they believe by refusing to do so they&rsquo;ll keep a lid on possible inter-racial violence, and to a large extent they&rsquo;re expected to do that by the powers that be who want to keep whites docile for fear of white uprisings, which would cost them power and money if violence were to occur.</p>
<p>The prevailing thought for a long time now has been to placate blacks with soothing words and gestures over imagined injustices, but at the same time keep whites feeling guilty by lying to them.</p>
<p>Whites aren&rsquo;t respected as much as blacks, because whites do not impulsively turn to rioting over imagined injustices or even actual injustices.</p>
<p>I can say one thing with certainty:  The only thing the elite dregs respect is violence and a hair-trigger willingness to use it as a first, impulsive response.</p>
<p>Sad to say the only way whites are going to get any respect is if they take to the streets over every minor comnplaint, just as the blacks do.</p>

		<p> The FBI does the same thing with national statistics on murders: Hispanic perps magically become &#8220;White,&#8221; while they retain their Hispanicity if they are listed as victims.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t know why the FBI thinks anyone with normal intelligence is fooled by this. It is obviously intended to make the number of White murder/hate crime perps appear larger than it really is; and to cause Hispanic, mostly Mexican, murders and hate crimes perps to disappear like snow in July. </p>

		<p>I cannot find the words to express my disappointment in White Americans when it comes to committing hate crimes. We needed the help of Hispanics to claim credit for a paltry 62.4% of bias-related offenses. Blacks, who only comprise a meager 13% of the population of America were responsible for a whopping 18.5 percent of the overall number of hate crimes, and that number does not include the many thousands of sex crimes committed against White men, women, boys and girls in lockups and public schools throughout the nation. </p>
<p>White people invented everything worth having in this world. Our fully evolved brains sent men and women into outer space and to the bottom of the sea. We are and outstanding race, so why is it that we are unable to commit hate crimes at a rate that far exceeds our percentage of the U.S. population? Is it because we have not yet been goaded enough by the social engineering programs that have devastated our neighborhoods and turned our school children into soft-headed dullards?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably it. Don&rsquo;t worry. The progs have many more plans that are sure to provide you with ample motivation.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get those numbers up. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of pride.</p>

		<p>18.5% of hate crime offenders were black, when blacks represent about 12% of the population.</p>
<p>62% of offenders were white, when non-hispanic whites are about 64% of the population. If stats for hispanic offenders were broken out from white offenders, and if hispanics were offenders at more or less the same percentage as their proportion of the population (16%), then real white people would be committing hate crimes at a far lower rate than other racial groups in this country (under 50%).</p>
<p>(This is based on Wikipedia&rsquo;s entry on US demographics - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_demographics#Race_and_ethnicity)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_demographics#Race_and_ethnicity)</a></p>
<p>White people are far less likely to commit hate crimes than other groups.</p>
<p>And yet, if you were to ask the average person on the street what group is most likely to commit hate crimes in this country, and which groups are the most &#8220;hateful,&#8221; I wager most would blame white people. Worst of all, I bet most white people would say that white people are the most likely to commit hate crimes. </p>
<p>Sad how widespread and deep the anti-white sentiment in this country goes, especially amongst our very own people.</p>

		<p>Hate crime is a form of thought crime.  It is an effort to plumb the motives of the criminal.  If someone spray paints &#8220;n****r&#8221; on the home or business of a black person it is sufficient to punish that person for vandalism.  <br>
 <br>
Emphasizing hate crimes is an effort to draw attention away from the fact that whites are much more likely to be victims of black criminals than are blacks to be the victims of white criminals.  </p>

		<p>The website includes this &#8220;Caution to Users&#8221;:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Valid assessments about crime, including hate crime, are possible only with careful study and analysis of the various conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction.  (See Variables Affecting Crime.)  In addition, some data in this publication may not be comparable to those in prior editions of Hate Crime Statistics because of differing levels of participation from year to year.  Therefore, the reader is cautioned against making simplistic comparisons between the statistical data of this program and that of others with differing methodologies or even comparing individual reporting units solely on the basis of their agency type.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Apparently the numbers vary year to year. This is likely because each year they try to redefine their terms and methodology to hide the facts about black and other non-white crime.</p>
<p>If anyone who loves working with data is up to it, it would be interesting to see how this report changes year to year.</p>

		<p>To go into the percentages in this report is a waste of time.  The entire report is bogus from top to bottom, it&rsquo;s simply a totalitarian propaganda exercise designed to uphold the system that relies on white-hating racism and the entire panoply of Affirmative Action and related laws to stay in power.  There are about 1.5  million black on white assaults in any given year, in truth the majority are probably aggravated, if not motivated, by racial hatred.  But let&rsquo;s be insanely generous here and say that just 1000 of these 1.5 million + crimes are motivated by hate.  Where are they in this report?  Black on brown and brown on black crimes probably run into the hundreds of thousands per year, surely at least 1000 of them as well would qualify as hate crimes.  Where are they?  </p>
<p>The system has a problem on its hands with this hate-crimes report, on one hand it has to uphold the evil whites/innocent minority victims theme that its power rests on, yet at the same time it must avoid an accurate picture of the disaster of multi-racialism lest the whole enterprise be called into question.  So it cobbles together a made-up-out-of-whole cloth report that shows just 7800 hate offenses with the victims roster roughly in the politically correct order of favored minorities,  upset only by the disagreeable necessity of including at least a few whites as victims.  </p>
<p>In the fundamentally totalitarian atmosphere of political correctness not one Republican or Conservative or even Paleo-Conservative will attack the illegitimacy this report.  </p>
<p><i>Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small. In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, nor to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is to co-operate with evil, and in some small way to become evil oneself. One&rsquo;s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.</i>  -  Theodore Dalrymple</p>

		<p> I seem to recall that Bill Clinton and Janet Reno made the decision to report nearly all Hispanic crimes as being white. A good example of how it works is; if two Hispanics men get into an argument and Juan stabs Jose, Juan is reported as white, Jose Hispanic. Jose recovers, shoots Juan; now Juan is Hispanic and Jose is white. Multiply this a few thousand times and the picture becomes crystal clear and a pack of lies to boot.</p>
