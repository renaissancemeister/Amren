			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AAP, Nov. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>PAULINE Hanson has abandoned plans to move to Britain, after discovering it&rsquo;s not the racially pure utopia she was hoping for. </p>
<p>After returning a fortnight ago from an extended holiday in Europe, the former One Nation leader has reportedly said she&rsquo;s back in Australia for good and considering yet another return to politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love England but so many people want to leave there because it&rsquo;s overrun with immigrants and refugees,&#8221; Ms Hanson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;France is becoming filled with Muslims and the French and English are losing their way of life because they&rsquo;re controlled by foreigners in the European Union.</p>
<p>&#8220;Problems are worse over there than they are in Australia and Australia is still the best place in the world to live, but the same sorts of awful things are happening here too. Residents of Commonwealth countries who want to live here are discriminated against in favour of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Hanson, 56, spent two months touring countries including England, the Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania and France.</p>
<p>In February, Ms Hanson told Woman&rsquo;s Day magazine she was selling her home and property at Coleyville, south-west of Brisbane, and moving to Britain, partly because she was disappointed by the way Australia had changed.</p>
<p>Ms Hanson reportedly said she wouldn&rsquo;t rule out a return to politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still haven&rsquo;t got politics out of my system,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get asked constantly, &#8216;Are you going back into politics?&rsquo;  &mdash;  even by people who recognised me overseas.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was &#8220;difficult to say&#8221; whether she would sell her Coleyville house, but she said she would move &#8220;very soon, possibly interstate&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Pauline Hanson has been tortured for years over her poltical views.  She is the Nick Griffin of Australia.  What I find hard to fathom is that she was unaware that Britain had already fallen to the savage hoards.</p>

		<p>I have the greatest respect for Ms. Hanson and her message.</p>
<p>This story is disturbing because it deals with white flight on a global scale. </p>
<p>If an English speaking white cannot choose a &#8216;whitopian&rsquo; country to run to where they are a secure majority, then our race is truly at the tipping point.</p>

		<p>Ms Hanson, you are needed here urgently. The present government under PM Gillard has gone soft, very soft, on illegal immigrants,particulary from the middle east and south Asia. They are arriving here by the boatload with the aid of Indonesian people smugglers. Your former adversary and present opposition leader Mr Tony Abbot repeatedly said before the recent election that he would &#8220;stop the boats&#8221; but lately has had very little to say on these matters.</p>
<p>Now can someone give me an answer to the following: How is it that persons who are here (or in Canada or the USA also) ILLEGALLy can get the best legal brains available and have access to the highest courts in the land to have their cases heard, either to stay in Australia or get out of detention. In one recent case before the High Court of Australia the whole immigration detention law has now been called into question.</p>
<p>One simple reason is that we seem to be subject to UN treaties even though we live in soveriegn nations.</p>
<p>Who pays all these massive legal costs? Most of us would not know how to or be prepared to defend ourselves from a simple parking infrigement!</p>

		<p>An aussie here, she never actually made the claim that she was moving to England. She was going there temporarily. It just became something the media ran with. Unfortnately while I agree with some things she says, she is a pretty embarrassing public figure. She is a former fish and chip shop owner who really doesnt know what she is talking about.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not so bad in Australia because they don&rsquo;t put up with much PC nonsense.  Remember the Cornulla riots in 2005 when 5000 young Aussies told muslims thugs how they felt about them?</p>

		<p>Ms. Hanson seems like a nice, but very naive person. Even Australia, from what I&rsquo;ve read here, is too generous to immigrants. Only the Chinese and Russians seem to understand what needs to be done. And that ain&rsquo;t pretty.</p>

		<p>#6 says: <i>She is a former fish and chip shop owner who really doesnt (sic) know what she is talking about.</i></p>
<p>Judging from the fact that 3rd world immigrants are over-running &#8220;sovereign&#8221; white countries by the millions, she does &#8220;know what she is talking about&#8221; and is not afraid to state the obvious   &mdash;   as we do here.</p>
<p>And, a &#8220;former fish and chip shop owner&#8221; is probably more in synchronicity with most ordinary folks who work at real jobs, other than the over educated puppets who take their directions from the U.N. whose vast majority members hail from those same 3rd world countries. </p>

		<p>Promoting controversial views is a tough row to hoe. Pauline Hanson definitely showed courage in making the attempt but she&rsquo;s just not up to the task. It&rsquo;s better to sit down and shut up than stand up and make everyone who holds those views look foolish by association.</p>

		<p>Re comment #9 (and #6), the problem is a political figure she is too easy to make fun of because while she identifies obvious problems, she is not very articulate. As soon as she opens her mouth to speak and says but one sentence you already get the sense that she&rsquo;s not very educated. Which is fine and not something I look down on, but not ideal for someone who wants to be a leader of a political party. There&rsquo;s an honesty about her and her down-to-earth nature does appeal to a lot of people (particularly the working class) but I&rsquo;m not sure she has much of a political future in Australia left. After her last foray into politics a year or two ago her vote result was pretty dismal and she said prior that if the result was not good, she would be done with politics. I think she has burned her name out with most people already, something the media obviously helped a lot with.</p>
<p>RE the comments that &#8220;she should have known&#8221; what it was like in the UK, probably proves my point a little. How could a former leader of a patriotic party not have a sense of what the same pressing issues they trumpet about are like in other western nations? I could have told her that years ago and I&rsquo;ve never even visited the UK. Unless she just wanted to see it with her own eyes first, I suppose.</p>
