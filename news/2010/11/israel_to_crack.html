<h1><a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE6AR17Q20101128?sp=true">Israel to Crack Down on Illegal Migrant Workers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ori Lewis, Reuters, November 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Israel approved a plan on Sunday to hold and deport thousands of illegal migrant workers whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as a &#8220;threat to the character of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>In remarks to the cabinet, Netanyahu said thousands of migrants who have entered Israel mainly through Egypt in past years would be housed at a special holding facility, due to built in Israel&rsquo;s southern Negev desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must stop the mass entry of illegal migrant workers because of the very serious threat to the character and future to the state of Israel,&#8221; he said, adding Israelis who gave them work would face severe fines to make their employment unviable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cabinet approved the plan under which the state would control the migrants&rsquo; movement until they are deported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Israeli officials have insisted on setting up the camp despite sensitivities over comparisons with Nazi concentration camps where Jews were held and killed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week Israel began work to construct a barrier to seal off part of the border with Egypt&rsquo;s Sinai desert from where many of the migrants enter the Jewish state.</p>
<p>The project that includes both a physical barrier and electronic surveillance to secure 140 km (88 miles) of the 250 km border should take over a year to complete at a cost of 1.35 billion shekels (about $370 million), the Defense Ministry said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eyal Gabai, director-general of Netanyahu&rsquo;s office, said last week that over 35,000 migrants had entered Israel in the past few years and that in 2011 Israel could expect to see up to 20,000 migrants enter illegally.</p>
<p>Israel has brought in tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews including many rescued from famine in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Israel has also permitted the limited employment of tens of thousands of foreigners in recent years in such fields as farming, construction and care for the elderly and infirm.</p>
<p>Legislation restricting their numbers provoked strike action by farmers last week. They complain that without Asian helpers, mainly from Thailand, their costs will become prohibitive.<br>

		<p>Can the Jewish lobby in the US persuade our cosmopolitan Leader to speak out in favor of preservation of the character of the USA?  Of course our Leader probably thinks that the character of the US is found on the basketball playgrounds of the all-black Anacostia area of DC, filled with drug dealers, whores and Obama supporters.</p>

		<p>Israel does have a very significant population of non-Jewish and non-Arabic persons, illegal and otherwise! Does that surprise. And a lot of workers are needed as a segment of the most religious Jewish populace eschews all labor and lives on the dole more or less, government largesse.</p>
<p>Israel too wants all non-Jews becoming citizens to swear a special oath that Jews are not obligated to take. Israel is a magnet for some folks wanting a better life! </p>
<p>The Israeli wants to keep Israel for the Israeli.</p>
<p>Hard for some to fathom.</p>

		<p>As Americans, we could learn something from both the Swiss and the Israelis.  These two nations have the courage to deal with the problem of illegal and undesirable immigrants.  Unlike the USA and Great Britain!</p>
<p>I am sure Switzerland has secure borders.  The Israelis built a concrete wall for their security, not to keep people in, like the former Berlin Wall, but to help keep out terrorists. </p>
<p>Our own United States of America should build such a concrete wall on the USA-Mexico border, for the purpose of helping to keep out illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>Some of those attempting to cross the border between Egypt and Israel have been shot by Egyptian border guards.</p>
<p>The members of the Israeli capitalist class, like their equivalents elsewhere, simply adore cheap and tractable non-unionized foreign labor.</p>
<p>Until the first Intifada, almost all scut-work jobs in Israel were done by Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank [i.e. Judea and Samaria] but security concerns led to their very brisk replacement by Thais.</p>
<p>It is an interesting paradox that incessantly-demonized Israel acts as a magnet for Sudanese, Eritreans and others; much in the same way that apartheid-era South Africa did in the sixties, when people would walk barefoot all the way from egalitarian Tanzania to work as domestic servants in Capetown, Jo&rsquo;burg and Durban. </p>
