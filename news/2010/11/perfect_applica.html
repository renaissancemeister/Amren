			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deborah Snow, WAToday (Subiaco, Western Australia), November 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A YOUNG Aboriginal woman was &#8220;humiliated&#8221; to hear she might not look indigenous enough for a job promoting the Aboriginal employment initiative founded by mining entrepreneur Andrew &#8220;Twiggy&#8221; Forrest.</p>
<p>Tarran Betterridge, 24, a Canberra university student, applied for the post through ACT company Epic Promotions, which had been asked to find five people of &#8220;indigenous heritage&#8221; to staff a stall at Westfield in Canberra handing out flyers for Mr Forrest&rsquo;s GenerationOne.</p>
<p>Ms Betterridge was interviewed for 20 minutes on October 20 and told she was &#8220;perfect&#8221;. However, the interviewer, Emanuela D&rsquo;Annibale, said she first had to check with her client, an agency called Let&rsquo;s Launch, because of guidelines specifying it wanted &#8220;indigenous-looking&#8221; people for the job.</p>
<p>Ms Betterridge&rsquo;s mother is white and her father a Wiradjuuri man from the Dubbo area.</p>
<p>When Ms Betterridge phoned the next day, Ms D&rsquo;Annibale told her she was not needed as Let&rsquo;s Launch had already found enough employees.</p>
<p>Ms D&rsquo;Annibale yesterday confirmed working to guidelines that required at least some recruits to &#8220;look&#8221; indigenous. Ms Betterridge was &#8220;lovely&#8221;, she said, but &#8220;if you&rsquo;re promoting Italian pasta, and you put Asians there, how&rsquo;s that going to look? Wouldn&rsquo;t you pick an Italian to promote the Italian pasta?&#8221;</p>
<p>She would have liked to hire Ms Betterridge anyway, because &#8220;she was really nice, she had so much knowledge .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but the reason we needed at least one person who looked indigenous [was] so that it would be friendlier to indigenous people&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t have picked her for Aboriginal at all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to me she looked like an Aussie girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said in the end Ms Betterridge hadn&rsquo;t been hired because the agency decided it didn&rsquo;t need five people.</p>
<p>Ms Betterridge says her family is outraged and she is &#8220;shocked that a company that wants to increase indigenous employment would question hiring a person because they do not meet the colour standard&#8221;.</p>
<p>GenerationOne chief executive Tim Gartrell said he had instructed those responsible to apologise and would no longer use the recruiting contractor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The comment made by a recruiting contractor is completely inappropriate and doesn&rsquo;t reflect the views, practice or ethos of anyone in GenerationOne,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Despite this, the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council accused GenerationOne of abetting &#8221; staggering&#8221; discrimination against Ms Betterridge.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s Launch was unavailable for a formal response, but unofficially denied issuing the guidelines quoted by Ms D&rsquo;Annibale.</p>
<p>The incident comes as the issue of Aboriginal identity plays out in the Federal Court. Nine Aborigines are suing Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt for racial discrimination over referring to the &#8220;fashion&#8221; of light-skinned people identifying as Aborigines.</p>

		<p>Was the girl discriminated against because she was half aborigine or because she was half white? Obviously the latter. Which according to the racial marxists should be &#8220;okay&#8221;. Would they be making a fuss if she were an unmixed white person being discriminated against? I think not.</p>

		<p>Once again, the contradictoriness of the diversity nuts&rsquo; doublethink becomes blatantly obvious. &#8220;Race is just a social construct,&#8221; and yet this Aboriginal woman doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;look&#8221; aboriginal enough (maybe race is just a visual construct?). </p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-racism&#8221; is always self-contradictory like this. You never need to look hard to see the contradictions.</p>

		<p>Humiliated? This woman is as silly and unreasonable as any non-white, oh wait, she is a person of color. Doesn&rsquo;t she have a mirror? She does look white. Has the poisonous rhetoric she embraces caused her own eyes to malfunction? Maybe it has.  </p>

		<p>We saw this item on the TV news a few days ago. Even my wife, who is far more liberal on these issues than I am, said, &#8220;Aboriginal???&#8221;</p>
<p>Here in Oz, if you can identify as being Aboriginal then the &#8220;Man from the Government&#8221; can be VERY generous. Welfare$$$, Free University, Free Medicals, Government funded AA Jobs&hellip;</p>
<p>As Tim in Indiana said,&#8221;Doublethink&#8221; Very much so.<br>

		<p>I noticed, while visiting Australia, that the dark skin of Aborigines appears to be a recessive trait.  I also got the impression that almost all successful &#8220;Aborigines&#8221; are mixed.</p>
<p>I agree with the agency&rsquo;s decision to reject her.  Her situation is one reason why race mixing is not good for the children.  What kind of identity does this woman have?  She is neither truly white nor truly Aboriginal.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;if you&rsquo;re promoting Italian pasta, and you put Asians there, how&rsquo;s that going to look? Wouldn&rsquo;t you pick an Italian to promote the Italian pasta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why do they cast blacks as King Lear or as Greek gods in plays and movies?  I recently watched the first episode of &#8220;Merlin&#8221; from the BBC (a reimagining of the young Merlin) and lo and behold, there were blacks strategically placed here and there in Camelot, including the part of Guinivere.  (No asians though.  Those hypocrites!)</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re acting out an old English legend, &#8220;Wouldn&rsquo;t you pick a white person to promote the authenticity?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know. She sure does look White to me. I live in Canada and we have a number of people like this. They claim to be Aboriginals. I know this one woman who is much whiter then this girl and she is always saying she is a &#8220;native&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t know if she is delusional or pulling a con.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with Jay at 12.13AM on his observations concerning racial anachronisms in historical/mythical dramas.I am sure he will not mind me in correcting him that the Arthurian legends are of French origin and centre around a Welsh hero,not an English one. </p>

		<p>She does not look like an Aussie girl. She looks distinctly aboriginal except for the whiter skin. She also looks low IQ which she might not be but I must wonder what the IQ of her white mother was would choose to marry and bear the child of an aboriginal. This may sound hateful but it is not intended to be. Aboriginal IQ&rsquo;s average 60 to 70 which is not their fault as they are what they are. For any member of the white race to CHOOSE to fornicate with low IQ, dark skinned peoples and to bear their children is something which I simply cannot comprehend. The &#8216;lowest common denominator&rsquo; law comes into play here. While the children of these half-breeds will be smarter than the brown half, they will be less intelligent than the white half on the whole. This is simply unacceptable as it not only dumbs down one&rsquo;s nation, it also dumbs down the white race. Bi-racial children in very many cases end up hating the white race and rejecting the whiteness within themselves. Due to their lower IQ&rsquo;s and usually darker skin they feel they fit in better with non-whites and take up their causes which are always anti-white. Stupid, genocidal and clearly unacceptable. Our white forefathers had more sense in their little fingers in this area than all the marxist elitists our day have collectively. What have we allowed ourselves to become? </p>
