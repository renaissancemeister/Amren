			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Fields, Wall Street Journal, November 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The black and Hispanic caucuses emerged from this month&rsquo;s elections as among the largest blocs in the House, and their members said they planned to push hard for liberal priorities such as government spending to create jobs.</p>
<p>Members of the two caucuses will hold nearly a third of the Democratic seats in the next Congress  &mdash;  61 of the party&rsquo;s 190 seats  &mdash;  with the outcome of several additional House races still up in the air.</p>
<p>While centrist Democrats bore the brunt of the midterm election losses, members of the black and Hispanic caucuses, all Democrats and most of them liberal, won 56 of 60 re-election bids. They will gain seniority as the minority-party members on congressional committees and will carry a louder voice among the Democratic House contingent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Caucus members acknowledge that as members of the minority party in the House, they aren&rsquo;t likely to be setting the agenda.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Members of the caucuses said, for instance, they might seek to serve as a barrier if Republicans attempt to roll back health care and banking regulations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black caucus member Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D., Ill.) plans to introduce legislation on the topic early in the next Congress. &#8220;We need legislation that is comparable to the Works Progress Administration of 1935 that puts Americans to work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If Democrats support that, it would make us worthy of a return to power. Short of that we do not deserve to be in power.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The idea is likely to meet opposition from within the caucus. In an uncommon development, the Congressional Black Caucus next year will include at least one Republican, Allen West, who opposed the economic-stimulus program in his campaign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. West and Tim Scott, newly elected from South Carolina, are among only six African-Americans to be elected as Republicans to the House or Senate since the Congressional Black Caucus formed in 1969.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Scott said he hadn&rsquo;t made a decision about joining the caucus. The most recent black Republican in Congress, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, didn&rsquo;t join the black caucus when he was in office. The other African-American Republican lawmakers all joined. Amid Hispanic lawmakers, Republicans in 2003 formed a separate organization, the Congressional Hispanic Conference.</p>
<p>A second priority for the black and Hispanic caucuses is an overhaul of immigration policies that would include a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic voters, said Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., Ill.), &#8220;are a critically important swing constituency.&#8221; He said they would &#8220;support the party that is serious about fixing our immigration system in a way that rejects mass deportation and is realistic about how we move forward.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The good news just keeps rolling in. I do hope the ever-growing Third World component of the House Dem Caucus bludgeons forth its views on every possible issue. </p>
<p>With the ever-realistic Nancy &#8220;It&rsquo;s Never My Fault&#8221; Pelosi leading the Band of Dreamers, I&rsquo;ve no doubt this quality Caucus&rsquo; &#8220;Every Wish Will Be Nancy&rsquo;s Command&#8221;. </p>
<p>No immigrant left behind (or outside the US); no high school dropout denied a fully-paid university education(with degree guaranteed). </p>
<p>Too bad you&rsquo;re not in the majority, &#8216;folks&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Once the whites lose being the majority in the three branches of government, in addition to the overall population ratio, the end of this country is at hand.  It appears from all indicators that the path is set for whites to be the minority in their own country that they created.  This country will then sink into a third world country, over run by third worlders.  So, will the whites eventually establish another country of their own, stuggle mightly to re-establish their majority in this country, or will they gradually be submerged into the black/hispanic (inferior genes) races.  If the superior genes are submerged, it is gone as in past ancient civilizations. </p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t list the other nonwhites. In the next ten years we will have nothing but nonwhites in Congress and the W.H. </p>
<p>Demographics spell the doom of White America forever (so much for self rule as the Founder&rsquo;s intended) and we can no longer ignore it and hide from the fact that all this demograhic change was DELIBERATE! We have been displaced for a reason, someone elses &#8220;reason&#8221;. </p>
<p> We, as whites, have been told over and again that we need to act as individuals, (vote for the individual, etc.) not as a collective group of people, while all the other races knew better that to survive you had to be united as a race! </p>
<p>I am afraid that Whites will never again awaken to this fact. It took thousands of years for our race to grow and invent, create their own civilizations and lands only to let it all disappear. WHY?     </p>

 This is another example of a trend that starts in California<br>
and spreads elsewhere.</p>
<p> Here, every legislator from south of Santa Barbara to the<br>
Mexican border is identifiably ethnic. </p>
<p> Before this year, lots of non-ethnic voters elsewhere were<br>
still voting for Democrats. They&rsquo;ve since gotten a wake-up<br>
call from Obama and company.</p>

		<p>The more power blacks gain within the Democratic Party, the weaker the party will become.  The more concentrated it becomes with non-whites, far-lefters, and homosexualists, the less mainstream Americans will want to do with it.  There&rsquo;s little concern left for poor whites and blue-collar workers, who used to form part of the base.  Democratic brass is obsessed with cocktail-party issues, and union leaders pour funds into a party whose top priorities are gay privelege and perks for illegal aliens.  </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love how these people always say mass deportation is UNrealistic and that &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; (amnesty) is the only way to go?  Not only do Hispanics say this, so does the mainstream &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show hosts. The local talk show host here always says, &#8220;We are not going to deport these illegals, it ain&rsquo;t going to happen, so we need to have a pathway to citizenship for all illegals&#8221;&hellip;What a moron he is and is so afraid to OFFEND these hispanics since many in his audience are hispanic and he has &#8220;friends&#8221; that are hispanic. Also, NO mainstream media, left or right, will allow any kind of honest racial debate or they will all be fired. But of course, only White hosts will be seen as &#8220;racist&rsquo; if they even came close to telling any racial truths. </p>
<p> Has anyone ever listened to spanish talk shows and what they say about us Whites? Has anyone ever listened to most black talk shows and what they say about us Whites? Funny how the powers that be NEVER target those shows, it is only when Whites question the nonwhite immigration policies of our government and how they are deliberately displacing White America, that all hell breaks loose! Even the conservative &#8220;hosts&#8221; will reject any White caller who tells these truth and they are &#8220;mysteriously&#8221; cut off while the host berates that caller as a racist and a nazi.</p>

		<p>To be fair, some of our forbears invaded and royally screwed up the homelands of many of the non-white populations of the world.  Now they are flooding into our core lands in Europe and our created lands in the U.S., Canada and Australia and doing to us slowly what some of our ancestors did to theirs.  </p>
<p>I imagine the American Indians sitting around their council fires complaining about the plague of white men.  The letters of the 17th century black king of the Kongo (Aphonso) to the king of Portugal, begging him to stop taking blacks from his lands (after he sold so many that his kingdom was depopulated) also make me think.</p>
<p>Imagine how the provincial Romans in France or northern Italy or even England felt when the barbarian hordes of Germania were sweeping in, not appeciating the advanced civilization they were overrunning and trashing!</p>
<p>The big problem I see with this third world invasion of our lands is that there is no hope at all of anything like our freedom loving, yes, even tolerant civilization, ever rising again on this earth.</p>
<p>Why?  Because the earth is already vastly overpopulated and no other groups, besides whites, have any concept or notion of respect for other races and cultures.  </p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;re swept away and become a tiny, persecuted minority, does anyone honestly believe that a future massive chinese empire will be teaching tolerance or inclusion?  Will a Mexican hegemony be teaching social justice or will the return of Great Zimbabwe usher in a new era of prosperity and technological advancement?  How &#8216;bout those Indians and Pakistanis?  Nope, not there either.  What do you think?</p>

<p>Agree with your second conclusion, but not your first.  Why I disagree is way too convoluted and a bit too salty mouthed for this medium, but not for my own:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll net it out by saying that it was a certain cross-section of white voters that saved Harry Reid.</p>

<p><br>
That is not being fair.  That is patent nonsense, if you stop for a moment to  examine  it.  You should think again!   How could he beg the king of Portugal &#8220;to stop taking blacks&#8221; which he had SOLD to Portugal in the first place?    If he SOLD them, then obviously he was willing to part with them. This was not a case of kidnapping or theft. </p>
<p>As far as  &#8220;royally screwing up the non-white populations of the world&#8221;,  you&rsquo;ve been hearing too much leftist propaganda!  The simple fact is that we left those countries in better condition than we found them.  That is why South Africa Rhodesia, Kenya  were/are  wealthy and developed, while Ethiopia remains extremely backward to this day:  Ethiopia never had the benefit of being colonized.  (Overlook Mussolini&rsquo;s attempt  for several years.)</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Imagine how the provincial Romans in France or northern Italy or even England felt when the barbarian hordes of Germania were sweeping in, not appeciating the advanced civilization they were overrunning and trashing!&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Well, how about imagining how those Britons and Gauls felt when the Roman armies invaded THEIR countries, carrying off a great many to slavery in Rome!  That &#8220;advanced civilization&#8221; was built on  a foundation of slavery   &mdash;   enslavement of THEM!   And why do we speak of German &#8220;hordes&#8221;  but  Roman armies?  To the Britons and Gauls, they were Roman hordes, come to conquer and enslave them.  Those Roman  &#8220;hordes&#8221; and slavers  were hardly welcomed with open arms!  They bitterly resisted that &#8220;advanced civilization&#8221;.</p>
