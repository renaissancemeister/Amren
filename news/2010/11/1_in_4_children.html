			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Las Vegas Sun, November 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census Bureau said 26.3 percent of children born in Nevada that year were to non-citizen mothers, second only to California, which had a rate of 29.1 percent, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported Monday. The report did not distinguish whether the mothers were legal or illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Washoe County, the school district has 11,243 students in English language programs, and 75 percent of them were born in the United States, said Mary Ann Robinson, district coordinator for the English Language Learner department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bill Welch, president of the Nevada Hospital Association, said in the past 18 months, four southern Nevada hospitals have closed their obstetrics wards.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have other hospitals evaluating their OB services at this time based on the number of uninsured and underinsured patients presenting to deliver babies,&#8221; Welch told the newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;OB already tends to be a loss leader for most hospitals,&#8221; Welch said. &#8220;What is collected in payments for services is typically less than what it costs to operate that department.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob Fulkerson, executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, cautioned against blaming non-citizens for problems in the health field.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said non-citizens also contribute to local economies.</p>
<p>&#8220;They pay their sales taxes when they buy everything else here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They pay property tax through their landlord or through the homes they own. They are paying into the system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s not blame them for national immigration problems,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>17 states are filing laws to block citizenship for &#8220;anchor babies&#8221;<br>
So all these illegals had better stop and think what they<br>
are going to do when they have to haul their anchor babies back to <br>
Mexico and make a living their.</p>

		<p>As the USA becomes populated by low-skilled, uneducated Mexicans, there will be no money left for Social Security, Medicare, or anything else.  Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Check out the situation in California, once the economic powerhouse of America, but now quickly becoming a Third World basket case.</p>

		<p>Sounds like in the long term NV is another state conservatives will have no chance of winning an election in.  </p>

<p>Bob Fulkerson said exactly what I would expect from an executive director of something called the &#8220;Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada&#8221;.  Today anytime you see the word &#8220;progressive&#8221; in the name of an organization you can just substitute the word &#8220;Anti-white&#8221;.</p>
<p>I do blame illegal immigrants for our national illegal immigrant problems.  I&rsquo;m funny that way.<br>

<p>I suspect that the brats they bring into this world, and can&rsquo;t afford to support, will have to make the trip back to taco land right along with their illegal parents when neither of them can find jobs.<br>

		<p>It seems that every school district in the country is having to spend (read: waste) more and more money for english as a second language programs.  They just cannot get the money fast enough to keep up with the DAILY influx of latinos EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I don&rsquo;t even know why we even bother.  This will be a latino nation in 50 years.  NPR said so last month in a news report.  The government should be expanding programs for non-latinos to learn spanish. </p>
<p>I hate that thought because as a person who already knows a lot of spanish, I find it a TERRIBLE language in the amount of complicated verb forms and other grammatical constructs.    It&rsquo;s no wonder that most latinos are nearly illiterate in Spanish itself!  I also absolutely hate spanish music - bachachata, reagaton, etc.  It&rsquo;s all full of cuss words, sexual references, too much repetition and false bravado in a gangsterish sort of way.  </p>
<p>Funny thing is, neither blacks, asians or somali bantus will ever have any inclination to learn spanish or adopt latino ways.  I see black people treating latinos like garbage everyday!</p>
<p>  We whites can adapt and keep ourselves on top of the food chain.  Other groups won&rsquo;t.  Ah, the failure of diversity.</p>

		<p>That illegal aliens are paying taxes is a hollow argument at best and purposely misleading.  That they pay some taxes is irrelevant, it is an issue of quantity.  The issue is whether they carry their weight in society with a net gain in wealth or are they net takers?  The answer to that is the latter.<br>
This of course is a second level issue and diversionary to the core issue   &mdash;   illegal is illegal.  If a bank robber gets caught, have you ever heard the argument he pays taxes making the exchange of robbery for a modicum of tax-paying somehow acceptable?  <br>
The US is one of the very few countries that allows the children of illegals born in the US full citizenship.  Couple that with the US being one of the few developed countries that borders a third world country.  As Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman pointed out, &#8220;In principle, you ought to have completely open immigration. But with the welfare state it&rsquo;s really not possible to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The LIE that illegals pay their share of taxes is ludicrous. Do you know that what LITTLE they do pay is refunded to them every year? So they are really paying $0!!!!  They also claim the Earned Income Credit that gives them up to $5000 a year in &#8220;refunds&#8221;. THAT is OUR tax dollars that give them that!  These people LIE that want us to believe the propaganda of &#8220;they pay taxes also&#8221;, because they are also getting section 8 housing, food stamps, cash welfare for their kids, free education, free medical and you name it. They qualify for everything us seniors (citizens)and (who paid their taxes for 40 years or more!) can never get!</p>

<p>California a basket case?  You don&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>That contrail we saw off the coast the other day? It was Meg Whitman blasting herself into outer space to get away from California.</p>
<p>Can you blame her?</p>
