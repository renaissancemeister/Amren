<h1>Detroit&rsquo;s Unlikely Saviors</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bobby Ghosh, Time, Nov. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To disprove the charge that Detroit is in terminal decline, Nafa Khalaf offers himself as Exhibit A. In 1999, when he co-founded his business, which builds water systems and other public works, &#8220;people were saying the city was dying,&#8221; Khalaf recalls. &#8220;They said, &#8216;You shouldn&rsquo;t be doing business here.&rsquo;&#8221; But since then, his firm, Detroit Contracting, has thrived and expanded. Employing 23 people, the company brings in more than $20 million a year in revenue. &#8220;And 90% of my business is in Detroit,&#8221; he says triumphantly. &#8220;Does that sound like a dying city to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I remind Khalaf that his optimism flies in the face of the city&rsquo;s litany of problems  &mdash;  a shrinking population, chronic unemployment and overstretched services  &mdash;  my skepticism only encourages him to press on. What others see as an urban disaster zone, Khalaf views as a land of opportunity. The Motor City, he says, gave him chances that would have been inconceivable in his native Iraq. Khalaf went to Detroit&rsquo;s Wayne State University in 1986 to study engineering and was so impressed with the city that he never returned to his homeland. &#8220;You want to know if Detroit has a future? Ask us Arabs,&#8221; Khalaf says. &#8220;We believe in this place.&#8221; </p>
<p>Remarkably, that sentiment is shared even by those who never saw Detroit in its glory years  &mdash;  people like Sami, an Iraqi refugee who arrived this summer during the height of the nationwide furor over the proposed Muslim community center near Ground Zero. (Unsure of how candid he should be in his new home, he gave his first name only.) Although troubled by the controversy, Sami has no doubt he&rsquo;s picked the right place to start his new life. So what if he hasn&rsquo;t yet found a job. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before one of the restaurants or stores on Warren Avenue, which connects Detroit to the nearby city of Dearborn, needs another busboy or odd-job man. The path from there is already paved in his mind: &#8220;I will save up for a couple of years and open a kebab shop &hellip; then another one, and another one. If McDonald&rsquo;s can have restaurants all over the Arab world, then why can&rsquo;t I have kebab shops all over America?&#8221; As we walk down the street, he points to the brightly lit stores, many of them run by Arab Americans. &#8220;All of them got a chance to start something in this city,&#8221; he says. &#8220;My turn is next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khalaf and Sami speak for a community that is growing and prospering alongside Detroit&rsquo;s decay, one of the largest concentrations of Arabs outside the Middle East. The four-county region of southeastern Michigan has a population of at least 200,000 of Middle Eastern origin; some estimates put that number far higher. In Dearborn, home to Ford Motor Co., one-third of the citizens have Middle Eastern ancestry  &mdash;  including Rima Fakih, the first Miss USA of Arab descent. </p>
<p>For Detroit, a city in critical condition, this new blood could make a difference. The impact is twofold: a desperately needed infusion of new citizens at a time when an exodus has drained metro Detroit of its middle class, both white and black; and an economic boost from a culture that likes to start new businesses. The Arab-American community in metro Detroit produces as much as $7.7 billion annually in salaries and earnings, according to a 2007 Wayne State University study. (That amounts to more than twice Detroit&rsquo;s annual budget.) The controversial question, though, is whether Arab-American prosperity will remain at the edges of the city, at arm&rsquo;s length from the predominantly poor African-American population, or produce jobs and other benefits for the whole of Detroit. On the street, the question is often put more divisively: Are Arab merchants profiteers or pioneers?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The influx keeps coming. Any concerns newcomers like Sami may have about the city&rsquo;s economic straits are outweighed by the comfort and reassurance of living among their own people. According to a 2003 study, 75% of Arabs and Chaldeans in the Detroit area were born outside the U.S., but 80% of them had become U.S. citizens. When they arrive, many quickly set up businesses requiring little capital  &mdash;  gas stations, liquor stores and convenience shops. Ahmad Chebbani, chairman of the American Arab Chamber of Commerce, says more than 15,000 businesses in the metro area are owned by Middle Easterners. Surely part of the attraction is that to people from countries ravaged by war and poverty, Detroit can seem like a haven. But Chebbani puts it in less fanciful terms: &#8220;There are good deals here, and as a community, we&rsquo;re risk takers.&#8221; What they also have in common is a remarkable faith in a region where confidence has become a rare commodity. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While there are no authoritative statistics on how many Arab Americans are buying or starting businesses in the heart of Detroit, interviews with government officials and business leaders suggest it&rsquo;s a rising trend. But relatively few plan to move their families into the city. It&rsquo;s not easy to give up the sense of community and comfort in Dearborn, where shops stock Middle Eastern products, many schools observe Islamic holidays and there are at least eight mosques.</p>
<p>Another deterrent is the fear of racial conflict with Detroit&rsquo;s predominantly black population. The two communities have a relationship that is, if not openly hostile, one of mutual suspicion. In private conversations, Arab Americans say their businesses  &mdash;  especially liquor stores and gas stations  &mdash;  are disproportionately the victims of crime and suggest racial resentment is part of the reason. And African Americans complain that Middle Eastern businesses charge high prices and provide few jobs to those outside their community. In Detroit, Arab shopkeepers are sometimes resented, says Stockton, &#8220;because there&rsquo;s a perception that they help only their own people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet when a new immigrant group invests in a blighted urban neighborhood and takes up residence there too, the display of commitment tends to quell the resentment. The most notable example is southwestern Detroit, which has been transformed by an influx of Hispanic immigrants to the region  &mdash;  from 2000 to 2007, the Hispanic population of the Detroit area grew 28%  &mdash;  spurring an estimated $200 million of investment in homes and retail developments. Once desolate West Vernor Avenue is now the main street of what&rsquo;s known locally as Mexicantown, a thriving neighborhood of restaurants and shops. (Older ethnic enclaves include Greektown, Poletown and Corktown.) </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Arab Americans might even make Detroit a global crossroads. As Miami has become a link between the Americas and as San Francisco and Seattle have connected the U.S. with Asian countries, so Detroit has become a conduit to the Muslim world, notes the 2007 Wayne State University study of the Detroit community. You can already find that potential in small notices. On the website ArabDetroit.com, a linguistics company posts help-wanted ads to recruit translators from the local population to help the U.S. military in Iraq: &#8220;Together,&#8221; reads the ad, &#8220;we can rebuild a nation, heal communities  &hellip; &#8221; </p>
<p>That sounds a lot like what needs to happen in Detroit too. <br/>

		<p>As a person who has traveled around Detroit many times, I can tell you that the Arabs and various asians are making the city better.</p>
<p>The trouble for the multi-culturalists is that the same ol&rsquo; thing is going on.  One cultural group is pushing against another and in this case it&rsquo;s blacks who are being slowly elbowed aside.  As pointed out in the article before the sugar coating set in, the Arabs and blacks have almost zero interaction.  No one is feeling the love there.</p>
<p>The latinos in Detroit are out-and-out colonizers (like everywhere else).  Whole swaths of the city are like mexico now.  Again, blacks are not welcome.</p>

		<p>For those who&rsquo;ve never met a Lebanese or Arab migrant of any sort, this article should be enlightening.</p>
<p>Lebanon has a population of just 4 million, making even smaller than its neighbor Israel. Despite its size, the Lebanese diaspora are everywhere.  They have a worldwide network extending into nearly every Western country.  </p>
<p>Wherever they land, they aggressively go into small business, commonly sandwich and pizza shops, locksmithing and security, food distribution, taxis, and retail.</p>
<p>It is not an unfounded accusation to say that many are connected to smuggling: hashish and heroin to the West, stolen cars and goods to the motherland. Money laundering, tax evasion and drug dealing are second nature in their world.</p>
<p>When they achieve success, they buy property and put others to work for them, a role they appear to relish.  Lebanese are well known for abusing foreign domestic labourers; in Lebanon many are exploited like slaves. It is every Lebanese&rsquo; dream to achieve success and employ whites  (particularly attractive white females, in the bar business).</p>
<p>Taking a page from the Lebanese playbook, other Muslim entrepreneurs have followed them to the &#8216;land of opportunity&rsquo;, the hated West. </p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t stay within the confines of Detroit for long. When the colony of Arabs becomes congested, the male cousins and brothers (because they are a patriarchal people) will begin to fan out to outlying areas, seeking unspoiled white towns where they can bring their aggressive mercantile culture.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;he co-founded his business, which builds water systems and other public works.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, he sells stuff to the government, and hence, like the rest of Detroit, he is living off of taxpayers.  That&rsquo;s not really &#8220;Saving Detroit,&#8221; is it?  It is more like being a parasite on taxpayers. </p>
<p>The next thing we will hear is the he has been hired by the government as a &#8220;Consultant&#8221; to teach other governmental agencies how to better hire Arab and Muslims.  It just goes round and round and round, and meanwhile, the entire Nation is bankrupt!</p>

		<p>Speaking as a white guy that was born and raised in Detroit, I can state for the record that the Arab community in this area stands as a literal bulwark of social and cultural stability in an area that is otherwise plagued with a level of societal degeneracy the likes of which are so horrifying that even Dante in his grimmest musings could only dream of.</p>

		<p>A curious observation was made during the Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon in 2006.  It was discovered that 50,000 permanent residents of Lebanon held Canadian citizenships.</p>
<p>Presumably, these Lebanese had fulfilled minimum residency requirements to obtain a Canadian passport (three years), but their loyalty remained to their Lebanese flag and country. </p>
<p>Canadians were understandably vocal in their displeasure.</p>
<p>In response, Khalid Hashem of the Canadian Lebanese Cultural association bragged, &#8220;Once you are Canadian, it&rsquo;s either you are a Canadian or you are not Canadian. There is no second-class citizenship.&#8221; </p>
<p>Detroit, be warned. You are the new international hotel for Arabs seeking an American passport.</p>

		<p>Yea, this does not bode well for the US. Granted, the Arabs are a lot more industrious than the blacks, but do we really want to see the Caliphate of Michigan? Will those that come over here secretly start financing jihad against America? It sounds like  Michigan the launching ground for a fifth column.  </p>
<p>Imagine this place in 2020, after Saudi Arabia has secretly financed the Senatorial campaign of Kwame Kilpatrick. In return, a provision is inserted into the budget to allow first Wayne County, then later Michigan, to operate under Sharia law. A number of changes quickly take place. All liquor stores are closed and the penalties for possession are severe. Pig farms are outlawed as is the sale of pork and any products made from pigs. Non Muslims are subjected to a state of dhimmitude. Churches and Temples are subject to special taxation. Needless to say, those who are lobbyists, congressional staff and a few others are protected. </p>
<p>Under Sharia law in Michigan, all OB/GYN&rsquo;s must add a pious Muslim man to their staff to &#8220;watch out for the modesty of women&#8221;. Imagine that you are a 20 - 30 something woman (who is single) that must go in for your annual gynecological exam. While your doctor is examining you, his assigned individual from the &#8220;Department of Modesty&#8221; starts questioning your sexual history. You refuse to answer his questions. After pulling the records, it was determined that you lost your virginity at age 19 while in college. Since you have never married, you are charged with Zina (sex outside of marriage). Even though what you did was not illegal at the time and you were of the age of consent, ex post facto law is not recognized. Your choice is a hefty fine or 50 lashes and time in jail. </p>
<p>Having served in the Middle East, a scenario like this would not surprise me in the least. </p>

		<p><i>The influx keeps coming.</i></p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding.  Here are a few &#8216;small details&rsquo; <i>Time</i> forgot to tell its readers:</p>
<p>The Obama refugee resettlement goal of 80,000 has &#8216;settled&rsquo; 14,836  Iraqis, the largest refugee resettlement program in the world.</p>
<p><i>The U.S. State Department has decided to relax a two-year-old policy that limited refugee resettlement to the Detroit area because of Michigan&rsquo;s struggling economy.</i></p>
<p><i>Now, the State Department says anyone with family and friends can come to the area.</i></p>
<p>Did you catch the part about &#8216;friends?&rsquo;  Do you think DNA is being used to determine whether Iraqi &#8216;family&rsquo; members are related?  Is this about the &#8216;humanitarian&rsquo; issue of &#8216;resettling war-torn refugees&rsquo; or making money off of refugees?</p>
<p><i>One big reason for the change was the State Department&rsquo;s decision <b>to double the payments to resettlement agencies on behalf of each refugee to $1,800</b>. That money is designed to help refugees with their expenses, such as food and housing, for up to 90 days&hellip;The agency gets to keep some of the money for its own overhead.</i></p>
<p>Or is the true goal to import as many non-Whites as possible into White majority lands in order to replace and dilute further the White population?</p>
<p>Way back in January, before the Obama regime had even taken office:</p>
<p><i>Progressives at John Podesta&rsquo;s Center for American Progress (funded heavily by George Soros) began pushing the Obama team to commit to airlifting Iraqis to the US in the tens of thousands.</i></p>
<p>Or was Joe Biden right?  He claimed if we split Iraq up into provinces, the Chaldeans would have been able to stay and live in peace with the Kurds, the Shi&rsquo;ite and Sunni.  Didn&rsquo;t Rush Limbaugh mock Biden for suggesting that Shi&rsquo;ites, Sunnis, and Kurds could not live together peacefully?</p>
<p>As much as it grates me, I&rsquo;d have to agree with Biden in this case; it turns out he <i>was</i> correct, but instead of these ethno-religious civil wars taking place in Iraq, where they should, they now take place in Michigan.</p>
<p>WND reports:</p>
<p><i>Four Christians were arrested and thrown out of a public Arab festival in <b>Michigan</b>  – and at least two people claim a crowd cheered &#8220;Allahu Akbar!&#8221; while the Christians were led away in handcuffs for doing nothing more than engaging in peaceful dialogue and videotaping the event.</i></p>
<p>The Four Christians, are Iraqi BTW.</p>

		<p>My fave part of the article is when the blacks who wrecked this once-great city whine that the Arabs are not creating enough jobs for them.</p>
<p>True story: I once overheard two Puerto Rican co-workers here in NYC talking about Arabs. The first one expressed outrage that &#8220;they&rsquo;re coming into OUR barrio and starting up businesses!&#8221; The other one shrugged and said &#8220;You can&rsquo;t blame them if our own people are too lazy to open up a storefront.&#8221;   </p>

		<p>We whites grew soft in our rich and self-assured isolation of the 1950s, and ceased to have enough children to even maintain our numbers, opting instead for other satisfactions.</p>
<p>If we can recover enough grit to escape the demoralizing stupor and mind-control that has held us for the last fifty years, we will find ourselves no longer in splendid and easy isolation, but competing head to head in our own country (except that it will no longer be our own country) with tough energetic newcomers like these.</p>
<p>At least it won&rsquo;t be a situation in which we&rsquo;ll be likely to grow soft again, since the conditions and the competition will be hard-scrabble. And if we get pointed in the right direction while we still have the greater numbers, there&rsquo;s a lot that can be done.</p>
<p>But whites must regain enough confidence to begin having families again, instead of one-point-something children. A lot of the incentive for importing people would not have existed if we&rsquo;d kept up our numbers. In a world controlled by the bottom line of powerful people, we won&rsquo;t get far without supplying the workers that will be supplied by other people if we don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I live in a suburb of Detroit. The true figure of Arabs in this area is about 400,000. We also have around 400,000 Albanians here, too. We have the second largest Albanian population in the U.S. after New York city and we have the largest Arab population in the U.S. Most own cash businesses and pay very little taxes and most get Medicaid and food stamps even though they own a gas station and a party store and live in $250,000 homes. Non-white foreigners and non-Whites in general are all ripping off the system. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amazed at how easily these foreigners can rip off the system with impunity (not paying taxes, getting Medicaid, etc.). Many of the 18, 19, 20-year-old children of these Arabs drive around in brand new luxury vehicles which they own.</p>
<p>The whole metro Detroit area is turning into a multi-racial hell.</p>

<p>&#8220;We whites grew soft in our rich and self-assured isolation of the 1950s, and ceased to have enough children to even maintain our numbers, opting instead for other satisfactions.&#8221;</p>
<p>I must disagree with you on this interpretation.  Whites were hard-working and tough in those days, having just finished the Second WW, and facing Korea and the growing Cold War.  Whites also still picked farm crops.  I know many in CA who did it then, as I did a bit in the early 60s.  Regarding population; You and many forget that there was a Zero Population Movement that was active in the industrialized nations up until the 1980s, at least.  Intelligent people understood that a world bulging at the seems would become a difficult one.  What wasn&rsquo;t done, although I think it was attempted, was to spread the smaller family ethic to the third world.  Protestants have practiced smaller families longer because they figured out, sometime in the 18th century, that quality was more important than quality.  Mother Goose rhymes such as &#8220;The Old Lady who Lived in a Shoe,&#8221; is some cultural evidence of this attitude early on.</p>
<p>I always contend that the way to white survival is not a birthing contest, even if that were a strategy likely to occur or succeed, because it doesn&rsquo;t solve the overall problem, that being non-whites reproducing at huge rates and moving into lesser, whiter, populated regions.  Reducing the non-white, third world populations is the key.  One way or another, through disease, war, death dives when populated areas sustain upsets, natural or manmade, or a combination of these, will reduce population.  An intelligent WHO would try to plan for reducing world population, not feeding and bandaiding a steadily growing house of cards.  But primitive thinking and religious competition, leaves implementing smart ideas to totalitarian nations or nations forced into totalitarianism by their uncontrollable numbers, like China did.</p>

		<p>Arabs have been in Detroit for a very long time, since at least the 1930s.  Henry Ford actually went to the Middle East to encourage Arabs to immigrate to the U.S. and Detroit, and he also made similar trips to the American South vis-a-vis blacks.  All to bust the unions on the assembly line.</p>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t lionize Henry Ford, unlike a certain segment of the right-wing that just loves him for his musings about a certain &#8220;ethnicity.&#8221;  If any individual can be said to be singularly responsible for Detroit being black and Arab, it&rsquo;s Ford.</p>

		<p>If you won&rsquo;t breed with a new population group, anything they &#8216;earn&rsquo; or are &#8216;entitled to&rsquo; as a function of public benefits paid for by YOU is a slice cut from the common economic pie.  If they also won&rsquo;t breed with anyone else, then that added slice becomes a permanent decrease of useful GDP for everyone who was already here.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, where this new group are &#8216;successful&rsquo; (and I frankly question this, given small businesses depend on large economic scaling factors to get the goods in and keep the currency viable in buying them and we are a deficit economy on import/export with no major trade goods or resources for which we are &#8216;sole source&rsquo;) and resident failure populations are excluded as a result, those failure populations go elsewhere.</p>
<p>THEY ARE NOT REMOVED FROM THE EQUATION.</p>
<p>So effectively we lose a part of America.  We gain the indigene populace (whom we also don&rsquo;t breed with) that used to be resident in a pit of a city and are now a growing blight on somewhere that isn&rsquo;t.  And the new culture gets an easy entry into our society with social welfare staples which we would -never- be eligible for.  And so we are accused of standing by, doing nothing, ourselves &#8216;while Arabs do jobs we wouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All because &#8216;we&rsquo; (our government, over whom we have absolutely no control any more) are the only ones sympathetic to blacks, arabs and all the other racial groups that do not give a damn about anything but themselves.</p>
<p>Social Altruism vs. Tribal Interests.  Where those tribes are named Democrat and Republican, Guess Who Loses?</p>
<p>As for killing off global populations, maybe this-</p>
<p>Codex Alimentarius<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3aczc5y" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3aczc5y</a></p>
<p>Is what you had in mind.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need to actively hurt people to control global population.  Let them slaughter themselves as they look on at what we have.</p>
<p>The key is to realize that we are also NOT negatively responsible for leaving large areas of our land unfilled and keeping our population high quality, low density, because we -enjoy- unfulfilled potential as a point of pride in the environment and our future generation&rsquo;s possibility for growth.  </p>
<p>OUR futures.  Not the ROWs.</p>
<p>Keep the 3rd World Out.  Boost internal breeding with incentives when we need to hold the population to a 100-150 million level, here.  Shift to robotics for cheap labor.  And continue to evolve and grow as the only forward thinking culture group on the planet that has actually built 95% of our social, technological and art/philosophy civilization base thus far.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to stop thinking about what is wrong with the world that we can&rsquo;t fix, except by bringing them here.  And time to control our own nation, like 100% of the rest of the world does.</p>

		<p>Michigan has a concealed-carry law, and thanks to SCOTUS&rsquo; decision in McDonald v. Chicago, the Second Amendment applies in Detroit, as well. Arab merchants are going to act swiftly if Lumumba and Kasavubu try to commit armed robbery against their stores. They have EVERY RIGHT to do so.  </p>
<p>When Detroit had its race riots in 1967 and 1968, Michigan did not have concealed carry laws (criminals don&rsquo;t count) for the law-abiding, then. No state did, until Florida in 1986. The landscape has changed considerably, since then. If it doesn&rsquo;t already have it, Michigan should adopt Castle Doctrine legislation, which eliminates the duty to retreat from anyplace a person legally has a right to be, and allows that person to use deadly force.</p>

		<p>Except for liberal whites, there is not a single ethnic/social group anywhere in the world that takes a kind view of blacks and want them around in its neighborhood.</p>
<p>I guess we can witness the kind of race riots which happened in LA in Detroit in a few years time. Just wait for some Lebanese cops to rough up/shoot black criminal(s) and the aftermath that follows.</p>
<p>It will make the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict seem like a minor scuffle.<br/>

		<p>Arab Muslims saving Detroit, give me a break!</p>
<p>Those Arabs hate blacks and simply use them to make money, that&rsquo;s it. Otherwise, they wildly hate them; they hate them with a passion that would make a Roman General blush. I lived with them in Dearborn, I know. </p>
<p>If they had their way, not a black or Mexican would ever enter into their stores unless to overdose on what they sell them. End of story and a dose of reality here.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I dobn&rsquo;t give a damn what they&rsquo;re doing to improve Detroit. They&rsquo;re doing it for their enrichment only and for no other reason. The idea of more and more Muslims arriving here with their primitive religious laws are just another nail in the coffin of the US.<br/>
They&rsquo;ve become citzens only because it&rsquo;s to their advantage and not because of any love they have for this country.</p>
