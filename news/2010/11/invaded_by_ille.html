<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A study by Harvard professor G. Borjas states that illegal immigrants hurt the unskilled population in the areas they moved into and benefited the other residents because the services previously provided by unskilled locals could now be purchased at a lower price. Any economist would tell you that an increase in the supply of unskilled labor will depress the wages for those services. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a stretch to claim that unskilled illegal immigrants are one of the factors causing poverty {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip} Insider Monkey, your source for free insider trading data, compiled the number of illegal immigrants in each state and calculated the change between 2005 and 2009 (We used Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo;s data, which was derived from Census data). {snip} Here are the 10 states to where illegal immigrants are heading in large numbers:</p>
<p>10. Tie Between Wisconsin and Ohio: 20 thousand more illegal immigrants reside in each of Wisconsin and Ohio. This is a 20% increase, and the eleventh highest in the nation.</p>
<p>9. Missouri: 20 thousand more illegal immigrants reside in Missouri in 2009 compared to 2005. {snip}</p>
<p>8. Connecticut: 25 thousand more illegal immigrants live in Connecticut in 2009 compared to 2005. {snip}</p>
<p>7. Oregon: 30 thousand more illegal immigrants live in Oregon in 2009 compared to 2005. {snip}</p>
<p>6. New Mexico: 30 thousand more illegal immigrants reside in New Mexico in 2009 compared to 2005. {snip}</p>
<p>5. Indiana: 35 thousand more illegal immigrants reside in Indiana in 2009 compared to 2005. This 41% increase is the sixth highest in the nation.</p>
<p>4. Louisiana: 40 thousand more illegal immigrants live in Louisiana in 2009 compared to 2005. This 160% increase is the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>3. Alabama: 70 thousand more illegal immigrants live in Alabama in 2009. This 117% increase is the second highest percentage increase.</p>
<p>2. Illinois: 175 thousand more illegal immigrants live currently in Illinois compared to 2005. {snip}</p>
<p>1. Texas: 200 thousand more illegal immigrants live currently in Texas compared to 2005. {snip}<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll be willing to bet if those that were Left on immigration were the ones losing their jobs to those here illegally, they&rsquo;d be singing a different tune. It&rsquo;s the White working class or White working poor whom the Left elite despise so they don&rsquo;t care, working class Whites can do the Left sacrificing for them.</p>

		<p>CA was missed!   It has been overcome with anchor baby households.  It is difficult ot believe CA is not on top ten.<br>
Always question data from census/gov.   I can see the numbers with own eyes.  How can one really get a grip on how many illegal aliens are here????    V</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit surprised that California and Arizona aren&rsquo;t on this list.  We hope to move to northern Arizona in 2011, so if at least some of the illegals are going elsewhere, that&rsquo;s a good thing from our perspective.  </p>

		<p>I can attest for Texas being over run. I live near the new Cowboy Stadium in the D/FW area and this place now resembles a border town like Del Rio or Laredo. I&rsquo;m currently unemployed and have been seriously considering relocating, perhaps to the Pacific Northwest but from what I&rsquo;m seeing the job prospects there are even worse than Texas.</p>

		<p>The times may be a-changing in places like Wisconsin.  We now have a Republican Senate and Assembly, Republican Governor, and a Republican national Senator, all of whom have overtly or discreetly stated they are against sanctuary cities, benefits for illegals, open borders, amnesty for illegals, and FOR deportation.  If promises are kept, Wisconsin will no longer be a haven for illegals.  I&rsquo;d love it if the wave of new conservative governors and state legislatures would pass Arizona type laws, and we see the illegals scurrying out of every state and toward the liberal Left Coast and New England states.  Let THEM sink in their proclaimed diversity and &#8220;compassion&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I live in Alabama and it&rsquo;s getting to be wall to wall illegal aliens here. They have caused rapes to double and triple here, they&rsquo;ve been killing white citizens and they&rsquo;ve been putting locals out of work. Many whites here, myself included, want them gone, and how they get that way is immaterial. I don&rsquo;t doubt it 70,000 of these criminal aliens invaded my state, from what I can see, it&rsquo;s easily two or three times that.</p>

		<p>Illinois is # 2. This I can believe. Just in a few short years entire neighborhoods and shopping areas close to where I live have populations that &#8220;seems&#8221; to be comprised NOW mostly of &#8220;illegals&#8221;. And in just a few years it has become that way. The scouts have done their job for the invasion and it is succeeding.</p>

		<p>I used to live in eastern CT. Old factory towns that had large poor white populations, and fairly small black populations now have still small black populations but VERY big and growing Latino populations. Just 12 years ago, this was only just beginning.There were few Mexicans there in that part of the state. </p>
<p>I checked data on a website that will give you the breakdown on race,income,ethnicity,religion and such of the population of any city of your choice. It is taken from the census, I believe. I don&rsquo;t know if it is okay to post the website name here on the board. If you do a search on census or demographic data you will find it. </p>
<p>It is sad to hear of large Latin populations in Ohio. I have been to Ohio, and was so impressed by the farmland and town, and that it would be affordable, that I wanted to move there. </p>

		<p>I also can&rsquo;t believe NY is not on the list.  Everywhere is busting at the seems with latinos.  EVERYWHERE.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from the midwest originally, and it breaks my heart when I go back to visit the folks, you know, seeing illiterate third worlders making inroads in previously nice places, but NY just takes the case.  </p>
<p>Sometimes I go the ENTIRE day without seeing another white face.  And most of the faces I see are newly arrived immigrants all speaking spanish.  There are huge swaths of NYC and surrounding counties that are now literally foreign countries where I am the outsider who doesn&rsquo;t belong.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe any state is worse off than Florida. The big cities are still low on illegal Mexicans but just about every small town is around 50%. I know because I got so sick at my stomach seeing the state turn into a third world slum that I finally fled to North Carolina. Thankfully so far they haven&rsquo;t made it to where I&rsquo;m living YET.</p>

		<p>People were commenting about why California is not on the list. Simple - the invasion has been complete. Once most of the green card holders, illegals and their children reach 18 and are citizens, then they will have the &#8220;absolute&#8221; power politically.</p>
<p>In other words, we lost the cultural war and the spoils (CA.) belong to the hispanics.</p>
<p>Be aware, if you&rsquo;re white middle class and live in CA., you should be thinking about finding another place further north to live. Either now, or later - because you&rsquo;re gonna have to leave eventually.</p>

		<p>The comments here alone prove that the Third World is spreading and unstoppable all across America, from the largest megalopolis to the smallest one-traffic light berg.</p>
<p>Can there be any doubt that it is too late for our people despite the results of the election last week?  For those of you still not understanding of where we are, what we&rsquo;ve lost, how far gone we are, here&rsquo;s a list.</p>
<p>Listen up carefully!! How are we going to pull out of this?</p>
<p><b>Ten Signs the U.S. is Becoming a Third World Country</b></p>
<p>1.  Rising Unemployment and Poverty (do you really believe the government&rsquo;s figures?).</p>
<p>2.  Economic Dependence  (debt above 90% of GDP,  41 million U.S. Citizens on food stamps).</p>
<p>3.  Declining Civil Rights (Holder&rsquo;s Justice Department for example).</p>
<p>4.  Increasing political corruption.</p>
<p>5.  Military patrolling the streets (are U.S. troops training to deploy on urban streets in America?).</p>
<p>6.  Failing Infrastructure (power grid, dams, pipelines, bridges).</p>
<p>7.  Disappearing middle class (permanent, massive loss of blue-collar jobs).</p>
<p>8.  Devalued currency</p>
<p>9.  Media control/censorship (talk radio and the Internet are next)</p>
<p>10.  Prevention/control/over-regulation of Free Markets.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/57jap9" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/57jap9</a> </p>
<p>Worse,  Nobel laureate Robert Murdell of Columbia University, top currency expert in the world, told the <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> in October:</p>
<p><i>We&rsquo;ve never been in this unstable position in the entire currency history of 3,000 years</i></p>
<p>No wonder Tim Wise is celebrating.</p>

		<p>You can count Oklahoma City among those cities &#8220;lost&#8221; to the Illegals.  There is a large billboard in the NW part of the city for the Spanish-ONLY radio station that proclaims   &mdash;   ironically in English   &mdash;   something along the lines of &#8220;We reach all 350,000 Latinos in central Oklahoma.&#8221;  Virtually the entire Southern side of Oklahoma City   &mdash;   from the &#8220;Oklahoma&#8221; river to I-240   &mdash;   is basically ALL Hispanic now.  Southwest AND Southeast sides.  </p>
<p>And more coming everyday.  Some public schools in Oklahoma City now stand at 70% HISPANIC enrollment.</p>

<p>The reason my home state of California is not on the list is because it has already been lost to illegal invaders. We 5 million illegal invaders (and growing rapidly by the day), not counting their anchor spawn which have invaded this state. We have local and state governments / agencies made up of hispanics who are sympathetic to the plight of these criminals and who they themselves believe in promoting the la raza reconquista ; which is hard to argue that it&rsquo;s not in full swing here in CA.</p>
<p>Illegal invaders are voting in our elections and have no shame in doing so. Ask Loretta Sanchez in the 47th District about that. She knows full well how to pander to the la raza and especially the illegal ones, who often carry the most extremist views on their believed racial superiority. </p>
<p>The high school I attended has gone from White and some Asian, to ALL hispanic and crime ridden. The high school is surrounded by third-world barrios that would put tijuana to shame.</p>
<p>So this is why CA is not on the list. It&rsquo;s already been surrendered to mexico and is no longer worth saving. The election of Jerry Brown and Barbara Boxer ensures the job will be finished off&hellip;.<br>

<p>I totally agree with you there.  America is a lost cause.  We have spread ourselves too thin in this world.  That is why my family and I are planning to move back to Europe (Germany) in 2011.  That&rsquo;s where our ancestors came from and I believe that is where we belong.  I think other white nationalists should consider the same thing.  Europe is home.</p>

		<p>Many places in eastern Pennsylvania, of all places, now have large and growing Latino populations. Places in this beautiful state that were once largely white and affordable, although not wealthy were places I had considered moving to. Now, I don&rsquo;t know where to go. Why and how did this happen in Pennsylvania? </p>
<p>Is there a correlation between welfare handouts in poor, rural areas or in some of the old steel towns and growing Latino population? Anyone have any info? </p>
<p>The areas up north, where the Marcellus Shale oil deposits are being developed have also drawn many outsiders, and a growing barely bi-lingual Latino population. Areas once peaceful and white are now changed for the worse.</p>

<p>If you think it&rsquo;s bad in Alabama, just try Texas. Here we have a lot of sanctuary cities, I live in one, and we border Mexico. The same thing here only much worse. Theft, burglary, rape,child sexual assault and drunk driving accidents have tripled and our hospitals, jails and welfare department are overrun. Unless you&rsquo;re Mexican, forget about a lot of jobs like construction and more and more, you have to speak Spanish for other type of work. Worse, since it&rsquo;s a &#8220;sanctuary, the cops can&rsquo;t do anything. I&rsquo;m sick of it.</p>

		<p>Just this morning a financial pundit was speaking of the billions of dollars California needed to stay afloat. Money is being borrowed from the federal government daily. Yet, never do I see anything that remotly suggests that state leaders recognize a link between their money woes and a nation filled with people who are a drain on every social and natural resource possible. </p>
<p>Right now, our President is in India promising, I&rsquo;m sure, that he will increase visas so they can fill tech jobs since Americans are lacking in those skills too. Is there anything citizens of this nation can do? To hear our leaders tell it, the greatest country on earth is frozen in time, just waiting for third world inhabitants to rescue it with their superior knowledge.</p>
<p>What our President needs to do in his travels is to tell foreign countries that they must help themselves. We can no longer support the world. Advice will be forthcoming if requested, but the finanacail aid must cease. I despise, especially, money thrown at countries who hate us and who demand it as their due. Many countries such as Mexico are a lost cause. It is a parasitic nation, out of control, with savagery and bloodshed washing its streets every day. We are throwing money down a rathole there. They are not a poor nation, it&rsquo;s just that the money is controlled by government/drug cartels/elite, and never gets to the people. It&rsquo;s leaders only know how to demand that we take care of their people. This is unbelivable, yet it is so common that our leaders accept it and continue to fill our country with these criminals. Our way of thinking must change. We do not need to be the caretaker of the world. If we continue to think that, we are doomed, as are our grandchildren.</p>

For those of you still not understanding of where we are, what we&rsquo;ve lost, how far gone we are, here&rsquo;s a list.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>We are past that.  We are at the point where our ear-to-ear grinning &#8216;experts&rsquo; (swallowed the whole canary did&rsquo;ya?) are now predicting our total collapse into bankruptcy with a 69 trillion dollar, unserviceable, debt.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the &#8216;Chinese Professor&rsquo; URL someone put up here a few days back-</p>

<p>We are about to be -owned- by the third world.  Or maybe I should just say that the title change announcement is about to be made.  Because it&rsquo;s long a fait d&rsquo;accompli action.</p>
<p>Brilliant man by the name of Martin Bormann, the real power behind the Third Reich, responsible for 90% of it&rsquo;s government and industrial reorganization in the 1930s, addressed this very issue in a fall 1943 &#8216;Flight Capital Program&rsquo; conference with all &#8216;pure&rsquo; German Industry (the precursor to the Bilderberger Meetings).</p>
<p>In this speech he outlined a program of sending money abroad to be invested in subsidiary organizations where it could not be tracked, multiculturalizing socialism across nations and ethnies and then bringing it all back home to roost, in Europe.  Where Germany would lead through a facade of intermediaries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us your moneys, securities and technology and we will make you all rich, in a little bit&hellip;&#8221;  And in the 1960s, that very thing happened.  As Germany became richer than it had going into WWII.</p>
<p>Imagine how scary that looks today when so much of what was outlined seems to have come true.  The sad irony being that Bormann&rsquo;s presence at this conference is entirely a function of verbal testimony by witnesses from the likes of Krupp and IG Farben, Siemans and so on.  Because at the time, just talking about this was a death penalty offense.</p>
<p>Treason it was, in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on a schedule for annihilation of The West, it&rsquo;s all a setup.  It always was.</p>

		<p>I live in a fairly rural part of Ohio and if I go to Walmart, I&rsquo;m very likely to hear conversations in Spanish.  I live in Wayne County.  A friend of mine in neighboring Stark County says illegal immigration is a problem there.</p>
<p>@Brain Freeze:  Have you heard we have foreign troops training here too?  They&rsquo;d be more likely to fire on Americans.</p>

		<p>The reason states such as California, Arizona, and New Mexico aren&rsquo;t on this list is because if you actually read the article before trying to draw a conclusion as to what it&rsquo;s trying to say you would notice that it is about the top 10 states with the largest increase in the amount of illegals rather than the top 10 states with highest population of illegals. </p>

		<p>   I can attest to the illegals problem here in Ohio. You couldn&rsquo;t buy a job in Ohio. Much less one that pays anything. But then, I also have my age working against me (55). But our McDonalds has plenty of them sitting around being loud and obnoxious. </p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s Hitler, the <b>ultimate Keynesian</b>:</p>
<p><i>In the 1930s, Hitler was widely viewed as just another protectionist central planner who recognized the supposed failure of the free market and the need for nationally guided economic development. Hitler found a cure against unemployment before Keynes was finished explaining it.</i></p>
<p><i>What were those economic policies? He suspended the gold standard, embarked on huge public works programs like Autobahns, protected industry from foreign competition, expanded credit, instituted jobs programs, bullied the private sector on prices and production decisions, vastly expanded the military, enforced capital controls, instituted family planning, penalized smoking, brought about national health care and unemployment insurance, imposed education standards, and eventually ran huge deficits.</i> </p>
<p>Sound familiar?  Still think Nazi Germany was led by right-wing extremists?</p>
<p><i>Such programs remain widely praised today, even given their failures. Keynes himself admired the Nazi economic program.</i></p>
<p><b>Keynes himself admitted that his (and Hitler&rsquo;s) economic strategy would work best in a totalitarian state.</b></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on a schedule for annihilation of The West, it&rsquo;s all a setup. It always was.</p>
<p>Yes, and pity that more don&rsquo;t see it, falling for (as you so succinctly stated) &#8220;grinning ear-to-ear &#8216;experts.&rsquo;&#8221;  I hope you&rsquo;ve battened down the hatches.</p>
