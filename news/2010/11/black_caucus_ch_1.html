			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Catalina Camia, USA Today, November 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus says the Democratic leadership race between Reps. Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn is not a choice about one lawmaker versus the other.</p>
<p>But Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., wants this to be clear: An African American needs to be in the room when Nancy Pelosi, the likely top Democratic leader, makes decisions about how to counter the Republican majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a multiracial society,&#8221; Lee told USA TODAY. Clyburn &#8220;brings to the table what needs to be done for communities of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoyer and Clyburn are vying for the post of Democratic whip, the No. 2 slot in the party&rsquo;s leadership when the 112th Congress convenes in January. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., a Black Caucus member, says the needs of the Democratic caucus  &mdash;  and not race  &mdash;  will trump any other consideration in the leadership fight. He said in an interview that he&rsquo;s hoping for &#8220;corrective action.&#8221;</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re making explicitly racial arguments; everybody represents a group of some kind. No neutrality allowed. None of this content of character nonsense for them, that was just a nice sounding slogan at one time but now things must be apportioned first and foremost by race.  </p>

		<p>This will always be a major problem for the democrat party. They are as fractious a coalition as could be possible. There are members of every human nation on the globe residing in America, all of them (bar the European nation), natural members of the Democrat party   &mdash;   and they make up its ranks. As poor and rural whites flee the democrat party in horror, can it possibly maintain itself?</p>
<p>The democrat party has always relied on long time support of the white poor to sustain it&rsquo;s viability on the ballot. But I also think that the support of the white poor maintains its viability as a coherent unit. Without that central pillar to conform to, where will the democrats turn for solidarity? All of the different racial groups will naturally oppose each other, the smaller ones coming to rest under either the hispanic or black camps. None of them will accept gays.</p>
<p>Being the democratic whip, in 10 or 20 years, will be a bloodsport.</p>

But Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., wants this to be clear: An African American needs to be in the room when Nancy Pelosi, the likely top Democratic leader, makes decisions about how to counter the Republican majority.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>First off, Mz. Pelosi, you weren&rsquo;t elected to be &#8216;countering&rsquo; anybody.  This nation is so deep in the hole that the first person who makes a partisan fight of the matter should be summarily impeached or censured to get the message across that Congress is GOING TO BE AGAIN the servant of the U.S. People.  </p>
<p>And not the other way around.</p>
<p>Of course an easily intimidated woman allies with other victim psychologies because her genetic 4-point deficit in IQ doesn&rsquo;t let her pick a MORAL or RATIONALLY driven choice.  But only one which lets her make it a pro-vs.-con guilt gaming psychology.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
&ldquo;This is a multiracial society,&rdquo; Lee told USA TODAY. Clyburn &ldquo;brings to the table what needs to be done for communities of color.&rdquo;<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>69% white.  15% Hispanic.  12% Black.  Get bloody real and stop pandering to your smallest voting block (when they choose to show up at all) for the questionable privilege of seeing them vote democratic -if- there is a free goodie basket and a black candidate in it for them.  Democrats run the risk of having MORE THAN a representative black participation in their party which is not something they can afford to saddle themselves with-</p>
<p>Representative Corrine Brown<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/dbo9wh" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/dbo9wh</a></p>
<p>The quality of black representation in Congress is not simply a humiliation of blacks but of the United States.  And we are so laughed at now that we can&rsquo;t afford to give anyone an easy target.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is simply wimp speak for &#8220;Stop the bus, I want to get off the revolution!&#8221; from a man who recognizes how little sympathy there is in the country for black &#8216;achievement&rsquo; at the moment and doesn&rsquo;t want to sink Democratic legitimacy in a backstabbing fight for influence.  Not by a group that nobody really cares for because they have made it finally, crystal clear, through their president, that they are ONLY in it for themselves.</p>

		<p>Maxine Waters is facing a multitude of serious ethics charges.  Place her in the &#8220;room with Pelosi&#8221; or as the Black Caucus Chair and voila she is judgment proof!  No one would apply sanctions on a person in such a position for fear of being called racist against an uppity black.  </p>

		<p>The minority leadership vote will represent a critical juncture for the Dems.  Though it presently looks as though Pelosi will get only token opposition as leader, the Hoyer/Clyburn race for whip represents a showdown between moderate and liberal and, obviously, between white and black.  If I understand correctly, the vote will be secret, so no one has to answer for his/her choice.  There are over 40 blacks in the House, and we can presume that all their votes will go for Clyburn.  I believe there&rsquo;s about 40 or so more non-black &#8220;progressives&#8221;.  They&rsquo;ll either go for &#8220;the black guy&#8221;, or they&rsquo;ll send America a message that the Dems are not robotically leftist and vote for moderation.  The odds are, of course, that they&rsquo;ll go with Clyburn.  Pelosi apparently believes that Dems can regain the majority in two years.  She sees the Tea Party as &#8220;astroturf&#8221; and the nation&rsquo;s right-wing turn as a temporary setback.  Many liberals are delusional.  I heard Michael Moore saying that, if the Tea Party forms a third party, then the left can split from the Dems to form a fourth one.  He thinks lefties comprise 30% of the population, so they could win a plurality for Prez!  Of course, polls show that liberals comprise only 20%, so any far-lefter foolish enough to even further split that vote is already in la-la land.  </p>

<p>Race always trumps the nation, doesn&rsquo;t it Barbara Lee?  Since YOU are one of those multiracials, I suggest YOU do for your own &#8220;community&#8221;. </p>
<p>As for the USA being a &#8220;multiracial society&#8221; that is the problem to begin with. If we were a White nation only we would NEVER have all the problems we see growing at an alarming rate in this country and YOU know it, Barbara Lee! I hate that word, multiracial, and what it has wrought this nation.</p>
