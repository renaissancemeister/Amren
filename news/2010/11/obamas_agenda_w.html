			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rochelle Riley, Detroit Free Press, November 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two years ago, President Barack Obama was on the ballot. Tuesday, his agenda was.</p>
<p>By 8 p.m. it was clear: Obama lost Detroit. And Michigan. And control of the Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And on a day when, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, black voters could have determined the makeup of Congress, turnout was less than 15% in the American city and Democratic stronghold that has had the highest unemployment in the country and where nearly one in two working-age adults cannot read well enough to get a family-sustaining job.</p>
<p><b>His focus isn&rsquo;t on just 1 group</b></p>
<p>President Obama&rsquo;s strong adherence to a one-size-fits-all way of governing may, ironically, have cost him support at a time when he needs it most. In a recent White House interview with black columnists, Obama, when asked how he planned to reach out to black voters, said that his message was not &#8220;focused on particular ethnic groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet Tuesday, the president phoned in to several African-American-centered radio programs seeking support.</p>
<p>Heaster Wheeler, executive director of the Detroit Branch NAACP, said that too much pressure, particularly in Detroit, is put on black voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is, you cannot go into a depressed community and impress voters with the need to do anything because they don&rsquo;t believe their lives are going to change,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You cannot tell people who don&rsquo;t have a transportation system that can take them to an opportunity, who can&rsquo;t keep the heat and lights on in their house, that they have undue responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Shame on us!&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The political reality is this: There are more people in Detroit than in the state&rsquo;s next eight largest cities combined. There are more registered voters. Detroit used to determine state political outcomes. But many Detroit voters decided Tuesday that neither the president&rsquo;s agenda nor their own plight was worth the fight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Apparently, neither President Obama nor Wendell Anthony, who declined to return calls Tuesday, could get most Detroit voters to the polls.</p>

		<p>The problem for the democrats is far, far, FAR more serious than this.</p>
<p>Blacks will ONLY vote for other blacks now.  Not in general.  But specifically ONLY.</p>
<p>That means if Obama or another black endorses a non-black candidate, they will stay home.  ONLY if the candidate is black and often (as was proven not too long ago during an important primary) if that black candidate is a direct competitor with a non-black who is part of Obama&rsquo;s agenda, will blacks vote now.</p>
<p>This represents a fundamental (and likely permanent) change in the voting patterns of blacks.  It&rsquo;s the inevitable result of decades of pro-black racism by the democratic party.</p>
<p>Further, there are signs that this is spreading to the other identity groups that traditionally band together for the democrats.</p>
<p>For example, the radical gay AIDS infected recently heckled Obama so badly he felt necessary to respond directly to them (which is unheard of in Presidential politics and a sign of extreme weakness and desperation on his part).  Code Pink has been harassing the democrats so badly that the media has taken to blacking out the media coverage of it after they basically punked Clinton (who you may notice is keeping a VERY low profile).  Hispanic groups went so far as to run ads on spanish radio telling people not to vote.</p>
<p>The democratic party didn&rsquo;t just lose on Tuesday.  It&rsquo;s coming apart at the seams.  </p>

<p>Yes, and Rome used to rule the world.</p>
<p>Better take another population count of Detroit.  You will probably find that many have fled the city and those who haven&rsquo;t are too ignorant to vote or they are too busy washing their feet and praying to allah.</p>

<p>Well, tell that to Tim Wise and your editorial board, Miss Riley!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, Comrade BO has had to stand on his record and not the feckless accolades from his media harlots, or the childish wretches that beat bongos and chanted for him in 2008. In short, reality has hit home; he has cranked those mystical things called printing presses and communed with his oracle (the teleprompter) since his election, but the world still runs on work and its produced goods and services of value. This is why prices still keep slowly going up and the dollar is devalued on world markets, but we remain at 10% to 15% unemployment. It is not going to get better, if the printing presses continue to churn out &ldquo;dollars&rdquo; that are really worth &ldquo;fiddy cent&rdquo; or less; it will only get worse.</p>
<p>The black fools in Detroit might not understand this as you or I do, but they do understand that Comrade BO hasn&rsquo;t even given them his magic beans, let alone whitey&rsquo;s &ldquo;fiddy cent,&rdquo; and so they responded accordingly!</p>
<p>Now if only Republican Bo Peep and her sheep, could figure out this too and not enter the commodities and sociopolitical game too recklessly, we might make some progress.</p>

<p>We NEED to educate these folks about the civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>After educating THEM, THEY will then just flock to the polls.</p>

		<p>In 1950, Detroit had some 1,850,000 people, its highest total ever. In 2010, Detroit will be lucky to have 900,000 people. Around 750,000 of them are Bantu. With Detroit having some 50% unemployed, they couldn&rsquo;t find the time to vote? Shame on them, all right. Obama didn&rsquo;t promise them free money, so what&rsquo;s in it for them, they must have wondered.</p>
<p>I still remember that video posted by someone here at Amren, about how Detroiters lined up at places where they thought they&rsquo;d get free money. </p>

		<p>This article is somewhat misleading in that nothing much was at stake for the black voters in Detroit.  There was no Michigan Senate seat contested, and in the Detroit congressional districts the Democrats won big even with low turnout (Conyers won 76%).  Rest assured, Ms. Riley, that African-American voters will overcome their transportation and housing utility problems to cast their ballots in favor of Obama in 2012. </p>

		<p>I think they saw through the hype and baloney faster than many whites did and decided it all had nothing to do with them. And they&rsquo;re right; what has the windbag messiah actually done that they can see with their own eyes? They know a con artist when they see one.</p>

		<p>Apparently the blacks who came out for Obama so strongly in 2008 were a very politically naive sector. They believed almost magically (in the manner of the cargo cult religion)in the mulatto messiah&rsquo;s hope and change through redistribution and radical transformation. They fully expected large reparation checks, Federal make-work WPA-style projects, affirmative action on a massive scale, and all types of goodies and freebies falling from the sky. Yes, indeed, they expected their lives to be magically changed, and are now disillusioned and hopeless. <br>
    However, I believe they do take some solace that a bruvva is in the White House, so they can vicariously enjoy the state dinners, the trips to Spain and India, the helicopters, etc. </p>

		<p>It used to be something along the lines of: &ldquo;so goes California, so goes the Nation.&rdquo; Now I&rsquo;d say that something along the lines of: so goes Detroit or Los Angeles, so goes the Democratic Party. It seems somewhat ironic that the party is beginning to look a lot like rather very distinct clusters of people held together by their own anti whitey racism. The Jews supply the money and a most base and basic form of anti whitey hatred. The blacks are there to be bought and to supply the hate whitey attitude. The Mexicans are also there to be bought (and also be bought by becoming &lsquo;citizens&rsquo; that are then &lsquo;entitled&rsquo; to whitey&rsquo;s wealth and any other goodies); but coming from a hierarchical society where whitey is on top they seem at times confused by the Jews that are largely in control. The Mexicans really need to get with the program. And, oh yes, the anti whitey whites who are like the proverbial deer in headlights and will attach themselves to whomever hates their kinsmen the most; that is, in order to gain acceptance from those who hate them and literally wish them dead (for them and most blacks and Jews, the &ldquo;white man&rsquo;s burden&rdquo; will never end until every last one is dead).<br>
Yes, the lynchpin and common thread is anti-whitey hatred. As long as whitey doesn&rsquo;t have his or her own interest guarded, and there is an unlimited supply of whitey to produce the goodies, it works out just fine. That seems to be what is freaking them out right now; that and the distinct possibility, if not probability, that current economic events will force each group to look after its own interests in a more intense way. The problem is that they desperately need whitey to keep ignoring his own interests, but whitey is becoming self aware as the economy has imploded. What is somewhat entertaining, and sad at the same time (i.e., in the sense that it&rsquo;s sad to see what real Americans built destroyed by those who hate us), is that if one of the key DemocRAT &lsquo;minority&rsquo; groups becomes the majority and takes over some real estate, for example Detroit, and essentially kills their host, they wander around in a malaise without bothering to vote. It may be on some level interesting to watch, but is never pretty to watch a parasite kill its host, thus killing itself. Which leads to the question: Are they really that stupid? Answer: Clearly they are, and/or they hate us that much.<br>
They want our goodies, but they generally want us dead, and Detroit voting patterns are just another data point in the sad tale that has become America. Namely, first political and economic power and control, and then apathy after killing whitey and/or driving him out. The problem is that an America without whitey is, well, a lot like Detroit or East L.A., and the newly &#8216;empowered&rsquo; voters no longer have much to fight over, so they just end up fighting and killing each other, without even voting about it.<br>

		<p>I always knew Barack Obama was the guy standing on one end of a teeter totter called public opinion, looking to push a basketful of racial privileges uphill in taking his people to the next level of a &#8216;post-racial promised land&rsquo;, before the majority social conscience could see where this was going and put weight on the white end to drop the ramp.</p>
<p>Result: He couldn&rsquo;t give enough perks to his own, fast enough to sustain the inertia of his starting rush and he couldn&rsquo;t hold the illusion of false racial equity up to scrutiny by the rest of us, long enough, to get anything done.  At All.</p>
<p>And his presidency will likely be marked by that historical epitaph.</p>
<p>That said, what is really being described here is population islanding resulting in a psychology called &#8216;Bowling Alone&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
In Bowling Alone: America&rsquo;s Declining Social Capital (1995) Putnam surveys the decline of &#8220;social capital&#8221; in the United States of America since 1950. He has described the reduction in all the forms of in-person social intercourse upon which Americans used to found, educate, and enrich the fabric of their social lives. He believes this undermines the active civil engagement a strong democracy required from its citizens. Putnam discusses ways in which Americans have disengaged from political involvement including decreased voter turnout, public meeting attendance, serving on committees and working with political parties. Putnam also cites Americans&rsquo; growing distrust in their government. Putnam accepts the possibility that this lack of trust could be attributed to &#8220;the long litany of political tragedies and scandals since the 1960s&#8221; (see paragraph 13 of the 1995 article), but believes that this explanation is limited when viewing it alongside other &#8220;trends in civic engagement of a wider sort&#8221; (par. 13).</p>
<p>Putnam notes the aggregate loss in membership of many existing civic organizations and points out that the act of individual membership has not migrated to other, succeeding organizations. To illustrate why the decline in Americans&rsquo; membership in social organizations is problematic to democracy, Putnam uses bowling as an example. Although the number of people who bowl has increased in the last 20 years, the number of people who bowl in leagues has decreased. If people bowl alone, they do not participate in social interaction and civic discussions that might occur in a league environment.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2j3b6y" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2j3b6y</a></p>
<p>Which, given this is a 1995 title, is hardly an unknown concept among those who study sociology as the basis of political trends and behavior.</p>
<p>Whites are socially altruistic because we see in our joint projects, the chance to earn status points, make friends and work on a common social (networking) contract which can lead to profit for us as individuals.  That&rsquo;s what growing up in Ice Age Eurasia has done for us.  But there are limits to how much of the -system- of social altruism&rsquo;s true payoffs that we will share.  Particularly when they are not coming back to us but setting up a separate privilege caste we are not part of but must pay for.</p>
<p>Other ethnies, without our edge in verbal and conceptual idealism, are strictly tribal and so will follow the basic &#8216;Family, region, race, religion, what&rsquo;s-a-nation?&rsquo; road to accepting handouts but never generating a common social bond or surplus from which to give them.  Even to each other.</p>
<p>There is no trust.  There is no progressiveness.  Only an expectation of benefit.</p>
<p>This is why the &#8216;succeeding organizations&rsquo; as ethnic power bases mentioned above have not panned out.  Because, even the upper tier blacks and mexicans have no base on whom to rely in trading political power at the highest levels for social cohesion and support from their groups.  They are unbuyable because even a Democratic black can&rsquo;t get blacks to buy _the agenda_ of democracy, only the perks.</p>
<p>Culturally and presumably genetically, these _growing in numbers ethnic populations_ have no sense of themselves beyond that of the tribal consumer: I give you power, you give me goodies.</p>
<p>And that is why America is failing, the elder population groups (and whites are &#8216;diverse&rsquo; amongst ourselves too) are tired and have no more numbers or energy to hold everything together.  While the young up and comers have no interest or perhaps intelligence in assuming the responsibilities that go with the title of lead-dog.</p>
<p>Again, since this can hardly have been something &#8216;unforeseen&rsquo; at the high levels of political brokering that put&rsquo;s a black Presidient into office, the question has to be macrotized:</p>
<p>What _aren&rsquo;t we_ picking up on?  What debt-enabled sudden shift in power is anticipated that required America to be islanded as a seething mass of internal population struggles so fiercely divisive that something else, outside our system, could happpen?</p>
<p>America is dysfunctional and apathetic for an engineered reason people.  And it probably has everything to do with Globalism and a move to sieze power in a followon OWG by making us fight ourselves until we are weak enough someone can walk up and take it all away &#8216;from the short end of the stick&rsquo;-</p>

		<p>Well, as a humble Englishman, and a great believer in true democracy insisting on the ability of the electorate to understand what they are voting for ..&#8221;where nearly one in two working-age adults cannot read well enough to get a family-sustaining job&hellip;&#8221; then only the other half are qualified to cast a ballot which could affect the entire outcome&hellip; &#8220;his message was not &ldquo;focused on particular ethnic groups.&rdquo;&hellip; Groups.. isn&rsquo;t that plural? So which singular group is excluded and politically classed as unfocused? How myopic is your present POTUS? Of course, this should not be my problem, but when America catches a cold&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
