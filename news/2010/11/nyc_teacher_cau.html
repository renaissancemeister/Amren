<h1>NYC Teacher Caught Up in Spanish Curse Debate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cristian Salazar, Houston Chronicle, November 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It can be tossed off almost harmlessly like &#8220;damn&#8221; or dropped like an F-bomb.</p>
<p>On the streets of New York&rsquo;s diverse Spanish-speaking neighborhoods, it can be heard expressing joy, frustration and outrage.</p>
<p>Perhaps most notoriously in pop culture, it punctuated the film dialogue of 1983&rsquo;s &#8220;Scarface.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now a public high school teacher is suing the city after he was suspended and fined $15,000 for what school officials say was misconduct for using it in his Manhattan classroom.</p>
<p>The word, &#8220;cono,&#8221; (COHN&rsquo;-yoh) can be offensive. But that sometimes depends on how it&rsquo;s used and which ethnic group is using it.</p>
<p>Its literal translation refers to the female sexual organs, according to the Royal Spanish Academy in Spain. But the institution charged with regulating the Spanish language says the word also can express &#8220;diverse states of emotion, especially surprise or anger.&#8221;</p>
<p>The teacher, Carlos Garcia, declined to be interviewed. But his attorney, Sergio Villaverde, said his client didn&rsquo;t use the word. He also claims the court interpreter mistranslated the term during Garcia&rsquo;s disciplinary hearings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New York is home to tens of thousands of immigrants from across Latin America and the Caribbean. One ethnic group&rsquo;s profanity can be another&rsquo;s everyday slang.</p>
<p>Among immigrants from the Dominican Republic, where Garcia is from, the word is so widely accepted it became the focus of a popular online video clip.</p>
<p>The chameleonlike nature of the word is exemplified in the video clip posted by Sir Nube Negra called &#8220;Speak Fluent Dominican&#8221; where the host gives examples of &#8220;cono&#8221; to express: &#8220;Damn, girl, looking fine. Very Nice,&#8221; &#8220;Stop bothering me!&#8221; and &#8220;I heard your mother died. I am so sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one of the city&rsquo;s most diverse neighborhoods, Jackson Heights, there was disagreement over the degree to which the word could be considered profane  &mdash;  and whether a teacher should be punished for uttering it in the classroom.</p>
<p>Michael Izquierdo, a Dominican-born worker at a nutritional supplements shop, said that the word can be pronounced when you&rsquo;re happy, sad or agitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;El cono is used for everything,&#8221; he said, adding that a teacher could use it to commend a student without it being considered offensive. &#8220;It just depends on the tone that you are using with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Augusto Ayala, a worker at a nearby coin-operated laundry, said the word is considered lewd by Ecuadoreans like him  &mdash;  and best avoided among strangers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Feliciano Gonzalez, 47, selling produce outside at a nearby farmers market, said he didn&rsquo;t think that a teacher saying the word in class merited punishment. &#8220;In my country, Mexico, it&rsquo;s not a bad word,&#8221; he said, adding that he might use it if he were accidentally hurt, like in the phrase, &#8220;Ay, cono me di.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ricardo Otheguy, a professor of linguistics at the City University of New York and founder of a language research institute there, said context, intonation, whether it was fully articulated and the extent to which its use was premeditated would need to be assessed to determine whether its use was objectionable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One student testified at a hearing earlier this year that Garcia would use &#8220;cono&#8221; when the classroom was unruly. Another student, identified as G.T., testified he had heard Garcia drop it at least three times a week.</p>
<p>During cross examination, G.T. said he didn&rsquo;t &#8220;really know&#8221; what &#8220;cono&#8221; meant in English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The hearing officer wasn&rsquo;t tone-deaf to the word&rsquo;s mutability, calling it &#8220;a Spanish idiomatic expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As such, its meaning cannot be discerned by looking to a literal translation,&#8221; Martin F. Scheinman wrote in his decision. &#8220;Rather, as with any idiom, the meaning must be determined from the context in which the word is used.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Cono&#8221; is not the first word to cause confusion or consternation in the U.S.</p>
<p>For instance, &#8220;Cojones,&#8221; (coh-HOHN&rsquo;-ehs) which literally translates to &#8220;testicles,&#8221; can be a slang expression for strength or boldness. Volkswagen AG used the expression &#8220;Turbo-Cojones&#8221; on a series of billboards in 2006, but pulled the campaign in three cities, including New York, after a backlash from Spanish speakers.</p>

		<p>Gosh, Diversity sure is our strength, isn&rsquo;t it?  So many squabbling ethnic groups, and in return we get   &mdash;  - what?  Why, we can all feel good about Multiculturalism, of course.</p>
<p>I wonder if such Cultural Sensitivity would be shown to a White who used what we are forced to refer to as the &#8220;n-word?&#8221;  You can bet that no one would agonize over shades of meaning in <i>that</i> case.<br>

		<p>Having taught Dominican students for several years, I can say that the word &#8220;cono&#8221; is often used as an expression of surprise. </p>
<p>The more a word is used, the less offensive its original meaning tends to be. How often, for example, does one hear the word &#8220;s**t&#8221; used for anything other than the originally intended substance? (Admittedly it tends to depend on social class and race to a certain extent, as well as age)</p>
<p>Or to take another Spanish word used a lot by Mexicans, &#8220;cabron.&#8221; The literal meaning is someone who knows his wife is sleeping around with someone else but does nothing about it, a cuckold basically. But the term is used in many ways, and the tone of voice is key to whether it&rsquo;s offensive or not.</p>
<p>The point is that this teacher should not be disciplined in this extreme way, even though there should have at least been a warning that he should set a higher standard for the students since he&rsquo;s supposed to be educating them to move into a higher social class or at least to know what kind of language is appropriate for a job interview.</p>

		<p>Given that Spanish is spoken in 19 different countries it&rsquo;s expected that there would be a variety of interpretations. Other examples of that are &#8220;bicho&#8221; which in Cuba refers to a low form of life e.g an insect whereas in Puerto Rico it&rsquo;s taken to be obscene. The word &#8220;pollo&#8221; meaning chicken (the meat) when feminzied to &#8220;polla&#8221; in Spain is a slang word for male organ.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine whose Spanish is limited was in a little out of the way restaurant in Madrid and wanted Chicken with rice- Arroz con pollo. She ordered Arroz con &#8220;polla&#8221;. The waiter went back to the kitchen and she was totally amused by the loud outburst of laughter that emanated from the back of the house.</p>
<p>Friends of ours who were employed by Harrah&rsquo;s Marina in Atlantic City were sent to Australia to help with the opening of one of it&rsquo;s first Casinos in Melbourne. The CEO of the Casino invited them to a &#8220;get acquainted&#8221; dinner at their home. After what the wife described an delicious dinner, the CEO&rsquo;s wife asked her how she enjoyed the meal to which she replied, &#8221; It was wonderful. I&rsquo;m absolutely stuffed&#8221;! According to her the Australians at the table broke into hysterical laughter. She later learned much to her chagrin that in Australia &#8220;stuff&#8221; (the verb) is equivalent to the &#8220;F&#8221; word in its literal interpretation e.g &#8220;Gait stuffed myte.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta love languages. We hope that Spanish will NEVER become a second official language of the US if for no other reason than the total chaos that it would cause. The bottom line is that you never use a word unless you&rsquo;re sure of all it&rsquo;s connotations, even in English.</p>
<p>Lets not forget the Steve Allen song &#8220;Pretend you don&rsquo;t see her&#8221;</p>
<p>Pretend you don&rsquo;t see her my heart<br>
Although she is walking our way.<br>
Pretend you don&rsquo;t see her my heart.<br>
Just smile and pretend to be gay.</p>
<p>Imagine singing that to a crowd of under 30 years olds?</p>

		<p>Who cares?  The black students use the n word constantly, but will sue any teacher that uses it. I suppose the Hispanics have their own forms of hypocrisy. The point is that there is no education as civilized whites understand it in predominantly black or hispanic schools. I have no objection to a few third world or black kids in white/Asian schools, if they behave well, are culturally white(a time bomb in the black youth community) and have gifted skills. </p>
<p>Mass education of these groups in alleged academic oriented schools is a waste of time. Even in vocational schools, unless there is a strict conduct code and a principal who means business, the black/hispanic cohort will swear, smoke, sleep and fool around even if they are learning hands on practical skills that don&rsquo;t require abstract or critical thinking. </p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t want these people to fix your car let alone teach your kid in school.</p>

		<p>I seems even the diversityites have problems with diversity. </p>
<p>I am puzzled that a court interpreter was needed. Does this mean that a teacher in the NYC school system lacks sufficient fluency in English to participate in court? Say it isn&rsquo;t so!</p>

		<p>Australians, canadians, and the english use certain terms that americans do not, so you should not be surprised that Spanish nations have different meanings.   <br>
   My high school Soanish teacher was from argetina. In argentina, calling a man the spanish word for butterfly is a complement. Sort of like calling him a well dressed man. The rest of the spanish world it will mean that you thought the man to be a homosexual.<br>
   So on the Argenine sitcom, when the cousin from spain visits, and he is in a nice suit, someone will call him a butterfly, he will get angry and all sorts of hilarity will result.</p>

		<p>The Arabic word for CRAZY is the EXACT same word in Dari but means different thing ostensibly. In Dari, that same word means a man and a woman romantically involved&hellip;not really a lot of difference between that and crazy really!</p>

		<p>Watch out for false cognates, too.  I know a shy woman who was a foreign exchange student in Mexico in high school.  She felt embarrassed when she couldn&rsquo;t remember a spanish word for something, so she kept telling strangers she was &#8220;embarazada&#8221;.  Some kind soul finally pulled her aside and told her that meant &#8220;pregnant&#8221;.  <br>

		<p>I am sure we can think of many words that mean different things to different cultures.<br>
An insult to one culture, and a compliment or neutral in another.  So what?  As already said, if we spoke only English, and demanded those who come here be taught in english, were made to communicate in only English, and were expected to use only English in the workplace, we&rsquo;d not be forever dancing around trying to ingratiate ourselves with other cultures by speaking a language not our own, only to be condemned for doing so.  Be that language Spanish, ghetto-ese, or whatever.</p>

		<p>I teach all latino students in a high school.  They come from about twelve different latin american countries.  ALL of them, except for a precious few, use curse words and foul language in EVERY other sentence.  </p>
<p>The Dominicans love to use &#8220;Cono&#8221; (with the Spanish &#8216;enyay&rsquo; sound in the middle).  I asked my students what the word meant, and they said it was slang for a woman&rsquo;s private part.</p>
<p>When I asked why they used it so much, the Dominicans said they are used to using dirty language, even in front of their parents.  The Columbian students said likewise.  None of the class could understand why foul language was bad.</p>
<p>Now I grew up in a lower middle class/upper white trash, all white area and you would hear some curses and swear words, but not SO frequent that it was ever-present.  No one I knew, even the burnouts, would ever swear loudly and without end in public places like a school or a store, or even in front of their parents.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re dealing with third world, really trashy cultures of vulgarity.  When my students learn a new curse word in English, they proudly add it to their active repetoire.  It&rsquo;s sad hearing them adjust the accents to get it &#8216;just right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Spanish language radio disc jockeys likewise curse on the airwaves like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe, but because it&rsquo;s in Spanish, the FCC says nothing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let them give you that stupid arguement that their curse words are just innocent expressions used in different contexts.  </p>
<p>It would be like if we said the &#8220;F&#8221; curse to describe everything from a nice day to a pleasant surprise.  &#8220;That&rsquo;s a f***ing nice day!&#8221; &#8220;What a f***ing awesome coat you bought.&#8221;  &#8220;Oh, F*** me, I bumped my knee!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure you can use that word in all kinds of contexts, but it is still low class and better not to say.  Oh, the joys of diversity.</p>
