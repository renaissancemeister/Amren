<h1><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20101105/D9J9QS1G0.html">Election Nearly Wipes Out White Southern Democrats</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Evans, MyWay, November 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The white Southern Democrat  &mdash;  endangered since the 1960s civil rights era  &mdash;  is sliding nearer to extinction.</p>
<p>After this week&rsquo;s elections, the Democratic Party barely holds a presence in the region outside of majority-black urban areas such as Atlanta and Memphis. The carnage for the party was particularly brutal in the Deep South, where just one white Democrat survived across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>The Republicans&rsquo; effort to win over the South, rooted decades ago in a strategy to capitalize on white voters&rsquo; resentment of desegregation, is all but complete.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The losses were particularly disappointing for the party after the baby steps it made in the South in 2006 and 2008, when it picked up a host of Republican-leaning House districts and won Senate seats in North Carolina and Virginia. Many thought the party had learned its lessons and had begun to reverse recent history by nominating conservative candidates who hit the right notes on divisive social issues such as abortion and smaller government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democrats didn&rsquo;t just see most of their recent gains obliterated, they lost at least 19 Southern House members and a senator, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. Even some of the most conservative Democrats such as four-term Rep. Jim Marshall of Georgia and 10-term Rep. Gene Taylor of Mississippi couldn&rsquo;t withstand the wave. It also snared such veterans as John Spratt of South Carolina, the 14-term chairman of the House Budget Committee, and 14-term Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia.</p>
<p>When the new Congress convenes in January, there will be at most 16 white Southern Democratic House members out of 105 seats in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky. Two races in Virginia and Kentucky were still too close to call, so the total could be as low as 14.</p>
<p>The setback continues a four-decade decline for Democrats in the South, where they once dominated. The slide began after the civil rights movement, when Republicans under President Richard Nixon began employing a Southern strategy to retake the region by appealing to white anger over desegregation. The GOP later highlighted liberal Democratic positions on social and welfare issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With some exceptions, including Mississippi and Louisiana, Republicans control statehouses across the South. They picked up North Carolina and Alabama on Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s conservative Blue Dog coalition, which was founded in part by Southerners after the last Republican landslide in 1994, lost more than half of its 54 members, many in the South but others in swing states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as conservative-leaning Western states.</p>

<p>But how can this be?</p>
<p>We are so often told, that the hopes and dreams of Republicans remaining a viable political force past 2045 or so, requires them to grovel at the feet of blacks and lick the boots of Hispanics. What gives here?</p>
<p>Perhaps, the groveling and licking by Democrats from the 1940s to present is a recipe for failure?</p>
<p>Oh, perish the thought!</p>

		<p>These so-called blue dogs were nothing more than yella dogs.  Take for instance, Allan Boyd of Fl 2.  Many of us in his district tried to meet with him and when we finally cornered him at a staged town hall meeting, we wanted to know how he would vote on cap and trade, health care, etc.  He actually told us the opposite of how he would eventually vote on all issues.  Well he is gone now, a product of his own lies and schemes to appear conservative at home and vote the obama agenda in DC.  These people were the &#8220;new&#8221; Southerners, they race traded and baited until the very end.  Boyd would buy the sizeable black vote in his district through enormous grants to the &#8220;historically black university&#8221; Florida A&M; University, a corrupt diploma mill.  All the while the liberal white enclave in Tallahassee swung each election away from his opponents.  Boyd&rsquo;s own son was caught smuggling illegals across the SouthWest border so we knew where he stood on amnesty.  Anyway, this election was an answer to our prayers.  A good man won the election but it is sad that many good men ran in the past never had a chance against a corrupt official and the block voting of race.</p>

		<p>Good news.  The Democrats must pay for having betrayed the South back in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s.  This is a just punishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Republicans&rsquo; effort to win over the South, rooted decades ago in a strategy to capitalize on white voters&rsquo; resentment of desegregation, is all but complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strange how the party of Lincoln and Eisenhower switched their racial views with the party of Andrew Jackson and the Confederates.  Of course, this way pretty much just a political power strategy, and the Republicans have long facilitated our nation&rsquo;s demographic and cultural decline.</p>

		<p>Missouri, sort of an &#8220;outer South&#8221; state, showed similar shifts on Tuesday   &mdash;   In the 163-member State House, Republicans gained 17 seats, to increase their majority from 89 to 106 seats, going from 54% control of the body to 65%, almost veto-proof.  In the 34-member Senate, Republicans gained 3 to go from 23 (which was already veto-proof) to 26 out of the 34.  Finding a non-urban Democrat in the Missouri legislature is about as hard now as finding a tooth on a hen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in my state, or what is about to be my former state, a pretty good conservative candidate for Governor, Bill Brady, barely lost, even though he won 99 of the IL&rsquo;s 102 counties.  The counties Pat Quinn won?  All three of them:  Cook, St. Clair (East St. Louis-Belleville), Alexander (Cairo).  That means IL won&rsquo;t get a carry bill for another four years.  Coincidentally, RINO Mark Kirk, a &#8220;Republican&#8221; who won Obama&rsquo;s seat, also won all but those three counties.  I&rsquo;ve been pounding the table for statehood for Southern Illinois for awhile, and hopefully this wakes a lot of people up.<br>

		<p>This monolithic movement by the people did not vote for Republicans they voted against the present admninistration and its radical leftist bills designed to shift the wealth from white hands to black ones.</p>
<p>Almost every single piece of the Obama agenda is designed to help blacks some way.  If anyone else benefits, it is an unintented side effect.</p>
<p>Since it is common knowledge blacks can&rsquo;t compete in a capitalist system, the only way for them to gain prominance is to change the system to one that doesn&rsquo;t require competence.</p>
<p>The old Marxist blather of, &#8220;From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs&#8221; is indeed the basis on which Obama has built his agenda.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity, I live in Illinois and grew up in Missouri.  It is interesting how the two states have diverged over the last 30 years.  Missouri has become more conservative and Illinois more liberal.  In Missouri, you can legally keep a pistol in your car&rsquo;s glove box with no license required.  If you did that in Illinois, you would be guilty of a felony.</p>

		<p>The election of Obama has brought on a second Restoration, the original one having followed the last carpetbagger leaving the South.  A Southern Dem now has to be a special person in a special circumstance to survive.  In WV, Senator-elect Joe Manchin was elected because he convinced voters he would vote against Obama.  (Filling Robert Byrd&rsquo;s old post for only two years before the next election, he&rsquo;d better walk the line or else.)  Nick Rahall, a longtime WV Representative, is pro-coal and pro-gun and was handily reelected.  Also helpful in these contests was the fact that the GOP opponents were very distasteful, especially Senate candidate John Raese, a wealthly Floridian who stated that he got his money the old-fashioned way, by inheriting it.  He was even said to have a pink marble driveway!</p>

		<p>This reporter is wrong. The &#8220;Southern Strategy&#8221; was based on a host of social issues, not just forced integration. Kevin Phillips, and others realized that the liberal policies of the democratic party had alienated them from the majority of southerners. </p>
<p>It is a gross oversimplification to say that it was based soley on &#8220;anger over desegregation&#8221;</p>

<p>Exactly.  And it wasn&rsquo;t just in the South either.  My grandparents have been in Washington State their whole lives and, just like Reagan, they didn&rsquo;t leave the Democrats, the Democrats left them.</p>

		<p>So Republicans had increased their share of white voters and won. But mainstream conservatives are celebrating a more colorful GOP:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Republican Party is no longer near-monochromatic. For strictly political reasons alone, this is good news for the GOP. By about 2040, whites will be outnumbered by the aggregate number of African-, Latino- and Asian-Americans.</p>
<p>For Democrats, this demographic shift once would have been welcome political news, since minorities – especially African-Americans – were considered among their most reliable voters.</p>
<p>No longer.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/cpdUek" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/cpdUek</a></p>
<p>They act like this demographic shift is a natural process that is inevitable and GOP has to accomodate. Which just shows that they are indeed the stupid party. And bad for white Americans: they have written them off.<br>

		<p>Unless the Republicans comes down with a hard stance against non -white immigration it will, in the long run, be just as bad as the Democrats.</p>
<p>Whites need to realize that unless they stop non-white immigration into their countries, their culture and eventually the white race, will cease to exist.</p>
<p>All other issues combined are not as important as stopping, completely and permanently, non-white immigration into white countries.</p>
