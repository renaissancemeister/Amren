<h1>Phoenix Painter&rsquo;s Business Cards: &#8216;Hire a Vet, Not a Wet&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elias Johnson, KPHO-TV (Phoenix), November 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of Phoenix neighbors is furious over a flier they received Tuesday from a Valley painting company containing a business card with a racial slur for a slogan.</p>
<p>Joshua Ulibarri received the flier from Russell Lewis &amp; Son Painting, which showed a paintbrush containing a business card that read, &#8220;Hire a Vet, Not a Wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed something was marked out and it said &#8216;hire a vet&rsquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out until I lifted it up and it said &#8216;not a wet,&rsquo;&#8221; Ulibarri said.</p>
<p>The slur was covered by a black permanent marker but was still visible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CBS 5 News tracked down the painting business to a home in Phoenix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russell Lewis? Is this your flier?&#8221; the resident was asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&rsquo;s mine,&#8221; Lewis replied.</p>
<p>Lewis said he attempted to correct the business card by crossing out the term &#8220;Not a Wet&#8221; with a black permanent marker.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was desperate for work and I didn&rsquo;t have money to change the cards,&#8221; Lewis said.</p>
<p>Lewis said his Hispanic wife told him not to distribute the cards, but he said he was humiliated after standing at a Phoenix Home Depot with a sign that read, &#8220;Looking for Work.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&rsquo;t hate or anything,&#8221; Lewis said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very hateful for the people who read it today and brought it to our attention. It&rsquo;s very hateful,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry they interpreted it that way. It wasn&rsquo;t meant to be that way,&#8221; Lewis answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way are they supposed to interpret that?&#8221; Johnson asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were supposed to read what&rsquo;s in print,&#8221; Lewis claimed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lewis said he wholeheartedly apologizes to anyone he offended and he will not pass out any more cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe there&rsquo;s some credit there, that he crossed it out and figured out it was wrong, but to still post it,&#8221; Ulibarri said. &#8220;I was angry.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is the sort of small thing we should be supporting to get the Amren philosophy out there   &mdash;   don&rsquo;t do business with employers who use illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>My home maintainance contractor is an American and his family.  <br>
Boycott illegals.  Get the ball rolling.</p>

		<p>Just amazing that the news media feels it&rsquo;s their duty to track down anyone and everyone that doesn&rsquo;t conform to PC nazism.</p>

		<p>Remember the old adage sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me? I was often told that as a child. The slogan on the business card may have been in poor taste but how hard up is Johnson for a story? And Ulibarri needs to grow up. Both are a couple of race baiters to publicize this. Like the Hispanics haven&rsquo;t taken enough out of this nation to overlook something so trivial? Notice the only thing left you are aloud to poke fun at is white people. And we better have a sense of humor about our abysmal treatment or Joy Behar will call us racists (or b******) and tell us to suck it up! What cowards these sorry excuses for newsmen are. Let&rsquo;s see them do some real reporting. Like on the Mexican drug lords who are killing and beheading everyone.</p>

		<p>The best way is to interview the Boss and his workers before they start the job. If I don&rsquo;t like what I see, they don&rsquo;t get hired.</p>
