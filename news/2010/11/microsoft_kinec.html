<h1><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372205,00.asp">Microsoft Kinect Is Not Racist. Duh.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wendy Sheehan Donnell, PC Magazine, November 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the more ridiculous stories surrounding Microsoft&rsquo;s Kinect for Xbox 360 launch yesterday asserted that because the system&rsquo;s sensor had some trouble recognizing two dark-skinned users that it was &#8216;racist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It all started with GameSpot reporting that while testing the Kinect, two of its dark-skinned employees had problems with the system&rsquo;s facial recognition. According to the site:</p>
<p>&#8220;The system recognized one employee inconsistently, while it was never able to properly identify the other despite repeated calibration attempts. However, Kinect had no problems identifying a third dark-skinned GameSpot employee, recognizing his face after a single calibration. Lighter-skinned employees were also consistently picked up on the first try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Racism? Doesn&rsquo;t exactly sound like it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The PC World story ran with a photo of several African American children holding Kinect boxes with a caption that read: &#8220;Will all these kids be able to use the facial recognition features of Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox 360 Kinect accessory?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Consumer Reports followed up debunking the racism claims with a blog post and video asserting that the problem wasn&rsquo;t with users skin color, but with darker lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Microsoft agreed. &#8220;Kinect works with people of all skin tones. And just like a camera, optimal lighting is best. Anyone experiencing issues with facial recognition should adjust their lighting settings, as instructed in the Kinect Tuner,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Here at PCMag we can corroborate: Our African-American reviewer gave the Kinect a 4-out-of-5-star review and an Editors&rsquo; Choice award. In the tests for our Microsoft Kinect review, we had no facial-recognition problems. In fact, the system&rsquo;s impeccable recognition and motion-control abilities were a major contributor to our positive review.</p>

		<p>Oh, thank God! Microsoft&rsquo;s product is not racist! Now I can sleep soundly!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that, if we should ever reach the level of intelligence in computers embodied in HAL-9000 in the movie 2001; a Space Odyssey, the HAL-9000 computer will certainly inform us that all races are exactly, geometrically, proportionally, mathematically 100% identical in all aspects, and that there are absolutely no significant differences between the races whatsoever. </p>
<p>However, if we then try to program the computer that, while all races are exactly the same in all traits, a variety of races add a marvelous diversity to our society, due to their unique traits, and the only reason some races do more poorly in society is because of white deviltry and oppression, I&rsquo;m sure the computer will self-destruct in a cloud of smoke and its dying words will be&hellip;</p>

		<p>The game is clearly racist. I am middle aged and white with a herniated disc in my lower back. How can I compete in a dancing game in which the moves are obviously derived from minority dancing? Any attorneys out there?</p>

		<p> XBox sounds like a prison cell and &#8220;360&#8221; was a code word for blacks entering white areas in the south, according to Jesse Jackson. So thousands of black felons will have to sue Micrsoft for damages. </p>

		<p>I own a printing business. The extra work required to reproduce photographs of blacks that don&rsquo;t show only teeth and eyeballs is a nightmare. Printers hate it. So if sensors can be &#8216;racist&rsquo;, I understand and I have no problem with it.</p>
