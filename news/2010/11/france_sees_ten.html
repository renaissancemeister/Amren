			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angelique Chrisafis, Guardian (London), Nov. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fariz Allili looked out at the decaying tower blocks he calls the &#8220;ghetto&#8221;. Grafitti cakes his entrance hall, there is no heating, the lift has been broken for months and unemployed youths loiter with nothing to do. Even the local mayor calls this place a &#8220;vertical shanty town&#8221;.</p>
<p>Five years ago these estates in Clichy-sous-Bois on the edge of Paris exploded in riots that spread across France and led to a state of national emergency. The trigger for the violence was the death of two young boys electrocuted in a power substation while hiding from police. But the root cause was the hopelessness of a generation of young French people, ghettoised in dismal suburbs, marginalised and jobless because of their skin colour or their parents&rsquo; immigrant origins. Since then discrimination against the third- and fourth-generation children of immigrants has worsened, tension is rife and Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s rightwing anti-immigrant rhetoric is blamed.</p>
<p>Allili, 21, shared a school desk with one of the boys who died in Clichy. He witnessed the nights of rioting firsthand. The fourth child of an Algerian cafe-owner, he&rsquo;s one of the few youths on his estate who have managed to carve out a future, training in IT. But he doesn&rsquo;t feel accepted as French. &#8220;Sarkozy&rsquo;s constant talk of immigration and national identity chips away at you, but worse is the perpetual police stop and searches. Cops insult us, saying &#8216;Get back to your own country&rsquo;, &#8216;you&rsquo;re not welcome here&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s pretty hard to stomach when you&rsquo;re French.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than any other French president, Sarkozy, who himself has immigrant roots, has turned the issue of immigration into electoral politics. He has rounded up Roma, introduced France&rsquo;s fifth immigration law in seven years, banned Muslim women wearing the niqab in public places and launched a national debate on what it means to be French, led by his new ministry of immigration and national identity. In this week&rsquo;s ministry reshuffle, he dropped the contentious &#8220;national identity&#8221; title but shows no sign of softening his hardline immigration policy.</p>
<p>But the president&rsquo;s anti-immigrant stance, aimed at securing him votes from the extreme-right Front National, is not so much about newcomers. It is about French society&rsquo;s problems coming to terms with its own diverse make-up.</p>
<p>When Angela Merkel declared that multiculturalism in Germany had &#8220;utterly failed&#8221;, some saw it as a vindication of the French integrationist approach. Under the republican model, multiculturalism is seen as taboo. In France, once a French citizen you leave cultural and ethnic differences at the border and are theoretically seamlessly assimilated into the republic. Everyone is equal before a state that is blind to colour, race and religion. Ethnic minorities do not officially exist as it is illegal to classify and count people by ethnicity. But the glaring gap between the theory and the reality of discrimination is becoming a problem in France.</p>
<p>Despite an outcry about the urban riots, some racially diverse estates in Clichy-sous-Bois still face over 40% unemployment for the under-25s. A recent study of French citizens with immigrant parents found that they suffered higher unemployment, fared worse at school and faced more discrimination than other French people. Over a third felt society did not accept them as being French. They were stigmatised because of their race, religion and roots.</p>
<p>Another leaked report for the prime minister&rsquo;s office warned of a &#8220;ghetto effect&#8221; in some schools where integration had failed and children were identifying more with religion and immigrant roots than being French. Paradoxically these second- and third-generation French children, raised and schooled in the republican tradition, were less integrated than their often semi-literate immigrant grandparents who came from north and sub-Saharan Africa, Asia or southern Europe to work on building sites after the second world war.</p>
<p>The French government has taken grave offence at the booing of the national anthem at football matches and French youths waving Algerian flags. But social workers on estates say nothing has changed in five years since the riots and France is still raising a generation of dispossessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the kids in this neighbourhood are the fourth generation of their family in France,&#8221; said Mohamed Mechmeche, 44, a youth worker in Clichy-sous-Bois who after the riots founded the community pressure group Aclefeu. &#8220;They&rsquo;re born here, they&rsquo;re French, they don&rsquo;t even know Algeria. To now be harking back to their parents&rsquo; roots is proof that French society isn&rsquo;t working: integration and assimilation have failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything has been complicated by constantly referring to people as French &#8216;of immigrant origin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s still a ghetto here. Apartheid exists here. But that suits politicians of both the left and right. You want a scapegoat for society&rsquo;s ills, someone to blame? They&rsquo;ll always point the finger at us. Sarkozy has really let himself loose - now it&rsquo;s as if anything goes and people can make comments as prejudiced as they like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mechmeche, whose Algerian grandfather fought for France in the second world war, sat with colleagues lamenting a series of recent public racist remarks which he said showed France was going backwards. The interior minister, Brice Hortefeux, Sarkozy&rsquo;s oldest friend, was fined for racism after saying of a north African party member: &#8220;We always need one. It&rsquo;s when there are lots of them that there are problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>An heir to the Guerlain perfume empire said on TV he had worked &#8220;like a nigger&#8221; to create a new scent. Certain journalists had talked of &#8220;blacks and Arabs&#8221; being to blame for crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not new immigration that is a problem in France, it is integrating the diversity that is already part of society,&#8221; said Patrick Weil, immigration historian and author of How to be French. &#8220;People want to be accepted as French, but of course they feel different and not accepted when the president is using the language he&rsquo;s using. They are being made a target.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Lozès, head of Cran, a leading French black association, said the fact that French young people with immigrant parents were demanding their rights to be equal citizens showed that the principle of the republican system worked, but it had been muddied by extreme discrimination. Many youths with Arab or African-sounding names still find their CVs binned when applying for jobs, or are even asked to change them to something &#8220;more French&#8221;.</p>
<p>Claude Dilain, the Socialist mayor of Clichy, said the problems of marginalisation in diverse French suburbs had not been addressed over the last five years and the tinderbox of more urban rioting could go off at any time.</p>
<p>Khouloud Tombari, 21, who watched the rioting from her tower block window as a sixth-former, had started her own local catering company after she couldn&rsquo;t find work because of her name and her postcode.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent out 300 letters and CVs for jobs from secretary and receptionist to community work. I got no replies. So many people here have no work or are doing jobs beneath them. We&rsquo;re French but we&rsquo;re not considered as real French people. The discourse is getting worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born in France but feel totally rejected here, yet when I got back to my parents&rsquo; native Tunisia, people say I&rsquo;m French. I just want to be given a chance to succeed. We feel set apart from the rest of France as if we live on an island.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How shameful of the French to &#8220;ghettoize&#8221; the wonderful immigrants! Then they marginalize and jobless-ize them!</p>
<p>I was being sarcastic. Bravo for the French.</p>
<p>They will be the big losers if race and culture are ignored, as anyone with his feet in reality knows.</p>
<p>They also know that the immigrants, for all their declarations of being French, are sneaking their culture in.</p>

<p>As in the US, if the authorities try to deal with the loitering youth, they will be accused of profiling, harassment, and racism.</p>

<p>There is a reason for that, Allili isn&rsquo;t French and will never be French; more to the point, should he marry a treasonous French heifer and breed with her, his children will not be French either. End of story!</p>
<p>I am a quarter French, my father&rsquo;s French line originally had land grants in Québec from France&rsquo;s king in the 1600s or1700s. When they left there and moved here, they became Americans and intermarried with others of European origin. Can I ever really be a full-blooded  &ldquo;Frenchman&rdquo; again?</p>
<p>Nope, not really, and that is simply a hard fact of life!</p>

		<p>This guy Allili, has ethnicity confused with geography. He may have been born in France, but he&rsquo;s Arab, ethnically.</p>
<p>Ethnicity trumps geography. That&rsquo;s why all those Indians born in Uganda, couldn&rsquo;t understand why Idi Amin was throwing them out of Uganda, in the 1970&rsquo;s. Or why the Caucasian Boers in South Africa are marginalized. They can spout all they want to about how their ancestors lived in South Africa for 300 years, but that matters nothing to the ANC. Or Japanese being deported to camps in the western U.S. after Pearl Harbor, even though almost all of them were born in the U.S.</p>
<p>Failure to assimilate is compounding the problem for these French Arabs.</p>

Probably the maintenance men are afraid to go there, with all the &#8220;loitering youths&#8221; about.  They&rsquo;d probably be robbed of their tools and cash.  I can&rsquo;t blame them, I&rsquo;d be afraid too.</p>

		<p>Is France a sovereign nation or a member of the EU?  I frankly think that is what it will come down to as they are having what amounts to our civil war, in reverse.</p>
<p>As evidenced by his backing off of Gallic Pride as &#8216;National Identity&rsquo;, I doubt if Sarkozy has the backing or the stones to reverse 60+ years of conditioned guilt as treachery that began with De Gaulle being jealous of Allied Powers and particularly the U.S. for their and not France&rsquo;s role in post war Europe.  </p>
<p>And it will not end before &#8216;asians&rsquo; as EADS (Euro Arab Dialogue States) beneficiaries are either in complete control or lie in pools of their own blood, victims of a &#8216;breach of contract&rsquo; on what is Eurabia.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that the nationalism in France has to become a public hysteria much as it was during the times of the Revolution before a solid consensus of &#8220;Our Lands!&#8221; overrides the weight of past and present treaties.</p>
<p>Do the French have it in them to let their hair down and revert, culturally, to such a &#8216;primitive&rsquo; nationalist level?  Will the EU do more than stamp it&rsquo;s feet and breathe huffily if they try?</p>

		<p>The French were in Algeria for over 100 years and generations of real French people were born and died there without ever seeing the homeland or feeling that attached to it. They considered themselves French Algerians but true Algerians never considered them acceptable and wanted them out. Why then should these third or fourth generation Algerians, who ghettoize themselves and hate the true French, consider themselves French or ask why they aren&rsquo;t fully accepted in France? Logically, they have no argument and stand in a very ridiculous situation. They are not and never will be French and should return to their homeland. The same goes for all other arabs, blacks, asians and all the other third world peoples inhabiting the white world. You are not European. You never will be European. You don&rsquo;t belong amongst us. Go home!!!</p>

		<p>Elevators in housing projects are treated roughly. and can be dangerous to ride in.  They also serve as bathrooms.  Urine is an acid, and, aside from the smell, it eats at metal.  Elevators are difficult and expensive to maintain in that kind of environment.</p>

		<p>This casual discarding of white ethic identities always gets on my nerves.  Colonial countries are not based on a race or religion.  This much is known.  In America, Australia, Canada or Brazil it doesn&rsquo;t really matter the color of your skin, anyone can claim the identity if they get citizenship.</p>
<p>But old world tribal (ethnic) groups whether Chinese, as poster #1 mentioned, or German or Pashto cannot be expanded to include outsiders just by virtue of living among them for one or even five generations (unless some intermarriage goes on with the natives).</p>
<p>When some Indian guy is called &#8220;English&#8221; or some Arab guy called &#8220;French&#8221; or some black Jamaican guy is called &#8220;Swedish&#8221; I just want to roll over screaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;French&#8221; means a descendant of the Frankish German tribe.  English means some sort of Anglo/Saxon descendent.  How can those dumb Swedes even think to call some black African guy a &#8220;Swede&#8221; just because he got citizenship?</p>
<p>Even after living there for almost three centuries, white liberals and black militants call the white South African Boers interlopers and invaders.  Yet today if some Haitian from the slums gets off the plane in Croatioa, the diversity crowd expects us to call him &#8220;Croation&#8221; immediately, etc.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t anyone ever call them on that innane disrespect and disregard for authentic European ethnic identities?</p>

		<p>Immigration policy is set not by wise and principled elders. It is set by corporate elites.</p>
<p>In their world, all men are cogs in the global machine.  Third World immigrants are in Western countries because elites profit from increased consumption of goods and services.</p>
<p>Rather than being dismayed that Algerian youth aren&rsquo;t model French citizens, elite speculators look to profit in managing the chaos they cause.</p>

<p><br/>
Why blame French socety?   Why always blame the host for everything?  Why not the guest if he fails to fit in?  It isn&rsquo;t that &#8220;French society isn&rsquo;t working&#8221;. It used to work very well;   it&rsquo;s that the new style of  immigrants aren&rsquo;t working very well.  </p>
<p>Yes, assimilation has failed.  But in a realistic world, you can&rsquo;t turn Bantus into Chinese, and you can&rsquo;t turn Eskimos into Zulus.  Neither can you turn Berbers into Frenchmen.   They are simply too different and can never be made  the same. The Marxist mentality which has ruled France  since 1945 refuses to accept this and insists on seeing all humans as the same and interchangeable. They&rsquo;re not. </p>
<p>For at least 2 centuries,  since the French Revolution,  the French have failed to reproduce their numbers adequately  (with the added losses of many wars),  and France has relied heavily on immigration to make up the shortfall.   When that immigration came from other white European countries,  it was unnoticeable and easily assimilated. That worked. But now that the  colonial backwash of empire has been pouring in, and the whole world is no more than a day&rsquo;s flight away, the incompatibilities  between cultures and races are glaring.  This is no longer 1850, or even 1950.</p>
<p>If the guest fails (or refuses) to adjust to the host&rsquo;s way of doing things, perhaps he should be asked to leave.  Why blame the host for the guest&rsquo;s intransigence?<br/>

		<p>The do-gooders still are butt-kissing the black and Musliom criminals who either can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t improve their situations and think the government should support them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an ongoing chaos to contend with ever since these third world hordes were encouraged to inundate the country, because some radical leftist morons believed they needed the extra consumers, to further enrich the corporate geeks, and the inbreeders in the government were rubbing their hands together and hopping from one foot to the other, thinking they could increase their power via more tax units.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve messed the situation up far beyond what would have occurred had their grand scheme not been invoked in the first place.  And now they&rsquo;re sitting on a powder keg ready to explode, only this time their usual law abiding types are becoming involved to a certain degree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still looking for arms and ammo to come into the country by the tens of thousands from some Muslim group or country to be distributed among the blacks and Muslims who riot on a regular basis.  When it does, France will be the catalyst that ignites the fires of insurgency throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Having the regular citizenry protesting in the streets complicates the job government forces have to contend with and could prove insurmountable for them.</p>
<p>As in the US the regular French people are going to have to suffer crippling losses to their homes and neighborhoods before they get enough gumption to fight back against these government sponsored invaders.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But you&rsquo;re not French. You cannot be French just as I could not be Chinese if I happened to live in China. I just don&rsquo;t understand why these people were invited to France, or England or Germany. Who invited them?&#8221; Eric</p>
<p>  Two groups &#8220;invited them&#8221;: greedy, exploitative, unpatriotic, cheap labor, &#8220;business&#8221; interests, and flakey, anti-Western/White, Neo-Marxist, neurotic, guilt-ridden members of France&rsquo;s privileged elites.  Along with the controlled media, these well-connected, but unholy, groups have ruined much of France. </p>

<p>Yes.  They and other factions too. The capitalists were far from alone in this. The communists and their left-wing allies were delighted with this enhanced &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  And still other highly organized, special interest groups welcomed this weakening of European Christianity. </p>
<p>Now, some of these groups are becoming nervous and are having second thoughts about the monster they helped create. <br/>
They are wondering if enough is enough, but once it&rsquo;s started it&rsquo;s hard to stop.</p>

		<p>Many posters have asked, above, when are the French people going to do something about this?</p>
<p>My question is - where are the French people? </p>
<p>If you go to Paris, you will see very few who look  really &#8220;French&#8221;, (or even European).  Just as if you go to London, you will wonder where are all the English. Or to Toronto and wonder what happened to all the Canadians. Or Los Angeles and wonder what happened to all the Americans.  Where did they all go?</p>
<p>There comes a point where they become so minoritized that they cannot fight back. All they can do is flee, or succumb.</p>
<p>We can take a lesson from this: we must not allow it to go this far.</p>

		<p>All France would have to do to get rid of its entire muslim population would be to stop supporting them with welfare.</p>
<p>Everywhere muslims go in the western world, they are 95% on welfare.  Basically, they are an enemy army whose supply line is the social services network of their intended victims.</p>
<p>So, cut them off.  Declare them what they are&hellip;.enemy combatants.  Be honest and direct about what they are doing and why.  Then&hellip;.CUT THEM OFF!  Tolerate no discussion, opposition or debate, about it.  Consider arresting those who want to continue to supply this enemy, and charging them with treason.</p>
<p>The result would be an immediate, mass exodus of muslims.  Not just because they couldn&rsquo;t survive (a few could&hellip;.but would leave anyway)&hellip;.but because a lack of a supply train would make their invasion plans impossible.  They literally plan violent overthrow of governments like France but need food, fuel, supplies, lodging etc. in order to make that happen.  Without these things, an invasion is impossible (Napolean himself quipped that an army marches on its stomach).</p>
<p>These people want war.  Make war impossible and they have no reason to be there.  Force them to lead quiet lives, minding their own business, in their own countries, to the best of their meager abilities.</p>
<p>THAT is the issue the western world needs to face up to.  And it&rsquo;s pretty easy.  Admit discrimination is necessary.  No welfare for muslims.</p>
<p>Problems solved.</p>

<p>And then of course you have Marie-Antoinette (Austrian), Marie Curie (Polish), Marc Chagall (Russian), Eugène Ionesco (Romanian) who all are  part of French history and culture. Even if you don´t regard them as French, most of their descendants will be regarded as such.<br/>

<p>Whiteplight is exactly right. But, as always, he has exempted one other very influential group that has eagerly applauded the importation of non-white, non-European, non-Christians to further dilute the population. It has been a tri-partite alliance&hellip; or even four, if you want to add the suicidal Christian churches themselves. It is a complex answer, which has no one culprit.</p>

		<p>I suppose in the big picture, you can look at this as a continuation of the French retreat from their empire. With the collapse of French rule in Algeria, the last tier of defenses against the third world went down. And now we are seeing the &#8220;hordes&#8221; come marching into the homeland. One is reminded of those maps in old atlases showing the geographical positions of various barbarian tribe circa the Fall of Rome. The Goths are first in the Scythian steppes, then north of the Danube, then finally strolling down the forums of Rome. </p>
<p>Future atlases (perhaps all in Arabic) will show the positions of the Algerians:  in Algeria in the 20th century, in France in the 21st century and, who knows, North America in the 22nd. </p>

Well, they tried it before, in 732, and  got almost as far as Paris.   They were driven back at the Battle of Tours by Charles Martel.  </p>
<p>Today, they&rsquo;re back again for a second try, and now they&rsquo;re all over the streets of Paris, and everywhere  else in France.</p>

<p>Yes, more than a thousand years later, they&rsquo;re back for another try.  This time, it&rsquo;s going better for them than the first.  </p>
<p>Of course (symbolically speaking) the gates have been opened for them by traitors from within.</p>
<p>As pointed out by Bernard Lewis in his brilliant book, &#8220;What Went Wrong&#8221;, the crushing Turkish defeat at Lepanto, which was celebrated all over Europe as a great victory for Christemdom, was dismissed by the Turks and Moslem world as merely a temporary setback, nothing significant. Their historians hardly give it any mention.  It meant simply that Allah was not ready. The time was not right yet. But they could wait. There would always be another chance.  </p>

<p>Interesting about ex-Formula one driver Alain Prost being of Armenian extraction - I wouldn&rsquo;t know it. That&rsquo;s because Armenians last names almost always end in &#8220;ian&#8221;, like Ara Parseighian, William Saroyan or George Deukmejian (ex- CA governor) </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes. I had to look him up. his MOTHER was of Armenian descent, name: Karatchian.  (There are lots of Armenians in France, btw.)However, his father&rsquo;s name sounds to me more like Swiss or German origin.</p>
<p>My thanks also to Linnea for corroborating what I have always said here: that there are a great many modern Frenchmen who are not  all that &#8220;French&#8221;, ethnically.  His list of famous &#8220;Frenchmen&#8221; of non-French origin is but a scratch on the page. It could go on for many pages, and indeed for many books. <br/>
 <br/>
Soprano Fan beat me to it by mentioning that great French hero   &mdash;  Napoleon (who had not a drop of French blood).  Napoleon acquired French nationality only by a matter of a few days, because France purchased Corsica (from Genoa) only several days before his birth. If Napoleon had been born prematurly, he would have been Genoese. Whatsmore, his ancestors were from Tuscany, not Corsica.<br/>
 <br/>
Not to mention such other famous &#8220;French&#8221; heros of foreign origin as MacMahon, Kleber, Massena, Gambetta,  plus Cardinal Mazarin and Marie de Medici,  even Leonardo da Vinci (who is considered French in France and is buried there). Even Mary Queen of Scots was also a Queen of France and had been raised in Paris.   And there&rsquo;s  my personal favorite: Chopin  (Polish).</p>
<p>Yes, France has been a magnet for immigration for centuries. It&rsquo;s almost hard to find a famous Frenchman who&rsquo;s French!</p>

Yes, the difference is many of the famous French were descended from related European peoples, not from low I.Q. Third World peoples who will never be assimilated. I have seen leftists try to use the argument that since Chopin (or any pan-European &ldquo;Frenchman&rdquo; ) was mixed Polish and French, then mixed black African or Muslim Arabs will produce another uniquely &ldquo;French&rdquo; genius. This is nonsense. By the way, I know that Alexandre Duma was mixed Creole and had distant black ancestors. One exception doesn&rsquo;t change the rule. </p>
