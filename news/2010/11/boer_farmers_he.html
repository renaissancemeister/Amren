<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Africa and Georgia have little in common aside from a tradition of wine-making and a turbulent recent history. But a group of white South African farmers say starting a new life in the former Soviet state could be the solution to their troubles at home.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s 40,000 white farmers, mainly Boers  &mdash;  descendants from Dutch settlers  &mdash;  say they fear that South Africa&rsquo;s government is threatening their livelihoods with land-reform policies. When they first came to Africa, the Boer Voortrekkers, or pioneers, left coastal colonies to forge a path to the interior of the country in search of fertile land. Now some of their descendants believe the answer to their problems might lie thousands of miles away in the Caucasus.</p>
<p>In what would be an extraordinary migration, the Georgian government has invited South Africa&rsquo;s farmers to buy up land in the country for next to nothing in exchange for bringing their expertise and knowledge of modern farming methods.</p>
<p>Papuna Davitaya, Georgia&rsquo;s State Minister for Diaspora, said: &#8220;We are looking for investors in our agricultural sphere, because Georgia historically always used to be an agricultural country but in Soviet times we lost these traditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He welcomed a delegation of South African farmers to the country recently and gave them guarantees about what they could expect if they made the move. &#8220;Boers are some of the best farmers in the world,&#8221; Mr Davitaya said.</p>
<p>Last week, dozens of farmers attended a union meeting in Pretoria about a potential move to Georgia. A committee from the union plans to lay the groundwork in the coming months, and then co-ordinate a larger migration.</p>
<p>Hendrik Mills, a Boer farmer, told ABN television: &#8220;I think there are great prospects for farmers out there. It would be much better to invest money in Georgia than in Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>For many of the Boer farmers, whose ancestors settled in southern Africa 200 years ago, it would be tough to leave their ancestral homeland. But they say their lives are getting harder every month, citing fears of crime, violence, labour costs and land reform.</p>
<p>Piet Kemp, who is keen to emigrate, said: &#8220;We will start with 10 or 20 farmers, but I think there could be more than 1,000 farmers who could make a good life in Georgia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Georgia&rsquo;s government hopes that importing farming expertise will boost the country&rsquo;s agricultural and wine sectors. Georgia has produced wine for centuries, but most of it is semi-sweet and not very popular in Europe. Georgian wines were well-liked in Russia but a political dispute between the two countries led to Moscow banning all imports. Georgians will perhaps be hoping that if the scheme works, they will also benefit from some of the success South African wines enjoy.</p>
<p>But adjusting to Georgia might prove tricky for Boer farmers. The Georgian language is hard to learn. And there are no direct flights to Africa from the country. Not only that, but the climates in the two countries are completely different, as are farming methods.</p>
<p>Yet Mr Kemp insisted that he and others were ready to try it. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to come and make a new South Africa in Georgia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I am going, I will be a Georgian.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea has its critics in both countries. Georgian opposition politicians claim that the new arrivals are being sold the best land at knock-down prices while Georgian farmers are neglected. In South Africa, there is also unease at the idea of letting some of the country&rsquo;s best farmers leave.<br>

<p>When will black Africans learn the most basic lesson of life:</p>
<p>treat whites like solid gold, because when they abandon you in disgust and flee to safety, civilization in Africa will collapse and revert to the stone age.</p>

		<p>If I was a Boer farmer, I would clasp my hands and say prayers of thanksgiving that I was out of the new South Africa. Meanwhile, the Georgian government is to be commended for accepting these Boers into their land. Ironically, the land of Stalin&rsquo;s birth, is providing for these people, when the American, British, Canadian and Australian governments would not.</p>
<p>&#8220;In South Africa, there is also unease at letting some of the country&rsquo;s best farmers leave&#8221;.</p>
<p>NOW the South African regime is concerned over the plight of Boer farmers?! Don&rsquo;t they realize that self-preservation is more important than stuffing the guts of the ANC pols, with white-farmed food?</p>
<p>I guess it means that Bantus in South Africa are going to pull their own plows. Good! </p>

		<p>If we could get rid of the &#8220;multicultural&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; crowds we could have the Boers settle here in the USA.<br>
I for one would welcome them with open arms.<br>
They would be a great asset to MY country.<br>
This won&rsquo;t happen because they are white.<br>
It&rsquo;s a shame that any somalian kenyan, third-world person can get landed immigrant status here, yet, the best of our OWN KIND are consistently rejected.</p>

		<p>Goooood luck learning The Georgian language, as very few non-Georgians are fluent. But if anyone can do it, it&rsquo;s the workoholic Boers, though I wouldn&rsquo;t be shocked if their presence peeved off the locals, especially the mountaineers, where good fertile land is much coveted. Nothing will come of this. Very ironic.</p>

		<p>Hopefully the Georgians will learn what the Africans can not, basic economics.  A farmer creates more than just jobs for his family and a few farm hands.  A farmer supports an entire industry.  Farmers employ directly or indirectly mechanics to repair and maintain farm equipment, factories to manufacture farm equipment, truck drivers to transport the farm goods from farm to processing plants, as well as railroads.  The farmer supports the company that produces the bottles that hold the wine.  The farmer creates trade with other countries when his products are sold overseas.  My gosh the industries that farmers support is manifold.  And if they go beyond wine who knows where Georgia economy could go.  Cotton, corn, wheat, beef, lamb and on and on.  Not to mention keeping the country food self-sufficient.  Africans just don&rsquo;t get the economical ramifications of a prosperous agricultural industry.  They just see a &#8220;rich, white farmer with THEIR land&#8221;.  They don&rsquo;t see the hard work.  They don&rsquo;t even understand that land and a farm are not synonymous.  Farms are made, they do not magically appear.</p>
<p>If the Georgians can respect and protect the Boers rights and if the Boers can learn Georgian language and customs (which by the way doesn&rsquo;t mean abandoning Afrikaans language and customs, which can be retained at home and in church) this good be a God sent for both groups.  </p>
<p>And hopefully the Boers will start having many children both for their own survival and Georgia&rsquo;s.  Georgia has a birth dearth right now and could use some defenders against the Muslim republics on its borders.  With respect on both sides this could be a beautiful marriage.<br>

		<p>These people would be a big asset for Ukraine or Russia where there is a lot of fertile land and the kulaks were mostly killed by the bolsheviks. </p>
<p>Meanwhile in Romania the government is selling land to Quatar and China, the boers would be a much better deal than the treasonous deals with non whites.</p>

		<p>The US government welcomes backwards, eternal welfare parasites from Somalia and Nigeria but not productive Boer farmers.</p>
<p><i>Georgia needs expertise as it wants to uplift its agricultural sector which was destroyed by socialism and communism about 70 years ago.</i></p>
<p>Oh, the irony!  It seems Georgia and SA <b>do</b> have a lot in common.</p>
<p>Blacks are committing open genocide against White S. Africans and that there is no outrage in the West is obscene, vile and immoral.</p>
<p><i>Farm attacks in South Africa are 700% higher than attacks on farms in any other country on Earth.</i></p>
<p><i>The murder rate of South African commercial farmers is the highest for any specific group in the world 313 per 100 000.</i></p>
<p><i>3,664 farmers have been murdered in over 30, 000 attacks.</i></p>
<p>Yet the world, and the United Nations &mdash; that supposed bastion of anti-discrimination &mdash; say little or nothing about it.  Are international human rights activists up in arms?  Are international arrest warrants being issued?   If blacks were being hunted down and killed because of their race by Whites would the West remain silent?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest that the Boers destroy and burn everything behind them and salt the earth well, but it won&rsquo;t be necessary:</p>
<p><i>Around 90% of all one-time white owned farms redistributed to South Africa&rsquo;s black population have ceased to be productive.</i></p>
<p>Who will take us White Americans in when we are a hunted minority, our land is &#8216;nationalized&rsquo;, confiscated from us and redistributed to non-Whites? </p>
<p>And finally:</p>

		<p>This is good news, and I hope the migration is successful. I don&rsquo;t think language will be a problem. Most of them speak English which is widely understood. The next generation will speak Georgian fluently. Hopefully, other sane western countries that have declining populations will bring in the rest of the doomed white diaspora from Africa. </p>

		<p>Probably only a small minority of Boers are doing this, but regardless of the number involved, these people are making a mistake. Georgia is not a modern, Western country. It has no traditions of civil liberties or the rule of law. Hell, it&rsquo;s not really even in Eastern Europe. </p>
<p>Georgia is actually in the &#8220;Caucasus&#8221;, a distinct region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, south of Russia and north of Turkey and Iran. The entire Caucasus region is extremely violent and unstable. With the exception of the Armenians, the native ethnic groups of the Caucasus are notorious for their aggressive machismo. Besides the Russian-Georgian War, there are several other major conflicts going in this small area of the world (below). Despite what Wikipedia says however, NONE of the conflicts listed below have been resolved yet. Not a single one&hellip;</p>

I really really really hope this is going to work. It would not just be great for the Boers. It would be just great for all of us!</p>
<p>Since Boers are race realists, in Georgia we would have a white country. Whites in Caucasus again, race realistic again. Ready to defend themselves. This could be the surviving of the white race.</p>
<p><br>
Maybe in 20 years we can see black people at the border of Georgia crying racism and complaining why they can not get in. But then it would be no problem anymore. </p>

		<p>Having lived in South Africa for 24 years until we escape in 1999, the African blacks, as oposed to African whites and Ibndiansd are busy evicting, either by forcing them to leave the Continent or by killing them, but two countries, Zambia and Mozambique who have already learned that they cannot manage without the white Africans&rsquo; farming skills are inviting them to move and farm land in those countries.  The problem is of course that after a few years when the farms are well established, the black governments will (not may) bow to the will of the black people many of whom will be battling to survive in the modern world, to take over the farms just as has been done in Zimbabwe.<br>
Then those countries that are starving will be blaming the West for their droughts and lack of food and demand reparations or at least aid because of man-made (really solar) global warming caused by the industrialised West etc. as has been widely advertised in the Western media.  At least in Geoirgia, they will be living with people with a similar mentality to their own.</p>
<p>But what a shame, the forebears of the Boers were chased out of Europe by religious problems, set up in South Africa from the 17th Century, made the country the richest in Africa (by far) even without oil, and now are being chased out again by racist thieves who have terrorised (murdered and used propaganda) their way to governments.</p>

		<p>What is astounding about this, is that the Georgians have long been Eastern Orthodox; the Boers, Staunch Calvinists.</p>
<p>Time was, such a conflict of religious opinions would not have made for a good mix. But, as long as they can recognize that they are both White Brothers, maybe the Synod of the &#8216;Reformed Kirke&rsquo; and the Georgian Orthodox can achieve a &#8216;live and let live&rsquo; attitude.</p>
<p>The sad part is, the Boers would EASILY fit in, in someplace where the Reformed Dutch have long lived- Western Michigan for example. But a look at Calvin, Hope, or any of the other &#8216;historic&rsquo; Reformed colleges, today shows a desire to be as &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; as the most liberal UCC/TEC congregation, and not a desire to uphold the &#8216;traditions of their fathers.&rsquo; The Boers would gladly point out their fallacy, and for that, the Dutch over here &#8216;ain&rsquo;t much&rsquo; for sponsoring Boer Refugees, more&rsquo;s the pity.</p>

		<p>This is a positive story folks. Why all the gloom and doom comment?</p>
<p>The Boers are definitely going to a better place and there is something more going on here. Whites in Russia are recruiting tougher Whites from other parts of the world to colonize areas with troublesome Turko-mongolian muslim mountain people.</p>
<p>The Cossacks are back and they are being put in to contested areas, the same is being down here with SA Boers. Boers and Cossacks are tough people, they will do well in such a situation - much better than bringing Boer farmers to post industrial Britain with Orwellian laws against hate speech, thought crimes.</p>

		<p>The Boers will be fine in Georgia.  &#8220;Gruziya&#8221; is a Christian country.  They are a merchant people, hot-blooded, kind of lazy, they hate Russians.  The Russians had a lightning war with them a couple years ago.</p>
<p>But they will do much better with Boer farmers there.  They will be happy to let the Boers do the hard work.  The Gruzini are White enough to know better than to &#8216;kill the golden goose.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Boers are welcome in Georgia! This is about the only positive news to come from there. In particular because of anti-Russian hysteria in Georgia and likewise reaction in Russia. After all Blumenbach named the whole race after the mountain range that criss-crosses Georgia - the Caucasians. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Yet Mr Kemp insisted that he and others were ready to try it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to come and make a new South Africa in Georgia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I am going, I will be a Georgian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Note the difference between blacks and whites. Blacks want to be black no mater where they go. Whites are thankful for an opportunity and just want to live and let live.</p>
<p>God bless the Georgians. Boers should take this deal and thank God for the opportunity to leave hell on earth!</p>

<p>As soon as the white Farmers leave S. Africa, China will be bidding on getting the rights to the farms. </p>
<p>Better that those Afrikanners get their families out now, or they may have to take jobs working for the new bosses from the Orient. </p>

<p>&#8220;What is astounding about this, is that the Georgians have long been Eastern Orthodox; the Boers, Staunch Calvinists.</p>
<p>Time was, such a conflict of religious opinions would not have made for a good mix. But, as long as they can recognize that they are both White Brothers, maybe the Synod of the &lsquo;Reformed Kirke&rsquo; and the Georgian Orthodox can achieve a &lsquo;live and let live&rsquo; attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting comment.  Calvinists were some of the most virulent and angy of all the Protestant movements.  Terrible persecutions by the RCC, and The Thirty Years War, or its offshoots, are the likely reasons.  But most interesting is the idea that even these sort of traditionally warring Christian sects can transform into more tolerant forms.  Larger threats from outside usually cause some disputes to be put aside until the larger threat is dealt with, but I do not believe that the problems facing whites, people of European descent and ancestry will be solved with temporary alliances.  Whites need to unite, tolerate those of us who have departed belief systems, making for example, our ancestors (the blood line) our religion, or others who favor going back to pre-Christian, indigenous European spirituality and views.  The recognition that Jewish is first a religion, would be a sign of maturity as well.  After all, there is no Christianity without Jews.  There is a greater vision of what being indigenously European really is beyond 14th century definitions.  If we can do these things, then there is greater hope for all.</p>

<p>I beg to differ with &#8216;WhitePlight.&rsquo; As G.K. Chesterton noted a century ago, you can&rsquo;t &#8216;go back&rsquo; to paganism if you are an Englishman. Your entire culture is now a Christian one, and you can either destroy the image of God given in Christ, or bend the knee. There is no other option. And that is America and the West&rsquo;s greatest fallacy. For Christianity is not &#8216;Jewish,&rsquo; it supercedes Judaism, and has for 2000 years. That modernist minds co-opted to another view believe differently, &#8216;don&rsquo;t make it right,&rsquo; as Yum-Yum says in the Mikado.</p>
<p> Again, Chesterton: &#8220;Fallacies do not cease to be fallacies because they become fashions.&#8221;<br>

		<p>To Erica Brigid (re post #  35):</p>
<p>Georgia is the birthplace of Stalin, like Corsica is the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte, But, you can&rsquo;t really hold that against ALL Georgians. They&rsquo;re not a bunch of bloodthirsty Cossacks. They have had quarrels with Russians, mainly due to territorial differences.</p>
<p>Besides, I say the Boers should welcome the opportunity to go to Georgia, and re-establish themselves there. They have MUCH MORE in common with the Georgian people, than they do with the likes of Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Jacob Zuma Thabo Mbeki, or any other Bantu.</p>
<p>For starters, there&rsquo;s skin pigmentation.</p>
