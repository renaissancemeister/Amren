<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/nov/02/inter-racial-adoption-children-social-workers">Promote Inter-Racial Adoption, Children&rsquo;s Minister Tells Social Workers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Helen Pidd, Guardian (London), November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Social workers should make it easier for white couples to adopt children from different ethnic backgrounds, a government minister said last night.</p>
<p>There is currently no bar on inter-racial adoption, but the children&rsquo;s minister, Tim Loughton, said too many children languish in care because social workers hold out for &#8220;the perfect match&#8221; rather than deciding whether the would-be adoptive parents would provide a good home.</p>
<p>The result of this approach, combined with the shortage of non-white couples wanting to adopt, is that ethnic minority children are over-represented among the young people in care who never find permanent homes. It takes an average of two years and seven months to adopt; black, Asian and mixed-race children wait three times longer than white children.</p>
<p>Social workers are currently required to give &#8220;significant consideration&#8221; to race when placing children because of concerns they may struggle to settle in new families from different cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>But the Department for Education said ministers feel authorities should not be &#8220;over-sensitive&#8221; on the issue. A spokeswoman said last night that guidance to local authorities and adoption agencies is due to be reissued &#8220;in the next couple of months&#8221;. There will be &#8220;no substantive changes&#8221; to the official position on trans-racial matches, she said, &#8220;because the law is already pretty clear&#8221;. But ministers want local authorities to take a fresh approach to the way the guidance is implemented on the ground.</p>
<p>Loughton told The Times there was &#8220;no reason at all&#8221; why white couples should not adopt children from different racial backgrounds. &#8220;If it is a great couple offering a good, loving, stable permanent home, that should be the number one consideration,&#8221; the minister said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many social workers are holding out for the perfect match, so suitable couples are turned away and children are staying in care for years as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Social workers think that if they wait a few more years the right family will be found. But if there are no other issues, the couple offering a permanent home should be approved even if it is not an ethnic match.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are approximately 65,000 children in care, most of whom are not considered for adoption because they are too old or are moving in and out of the system.</p>
<p>Of around 2,300 approved for adoption last year, about 500 were of black or Asian origin.<br/>

		<p>From experience, I&rsquo;ve known many fertile well-off liberal secular Jews in the West who adopt 3rd world children. I don&rsquo;t get it. I just don&rsquo;t. But I can&rsquo;t imagine this trend taking place in E. Europe, even in Catholic countries. I think that fertile people adopting at all is sick now that we know about genetics &amp; heritability but it&rsquo;s insane when they adopt 3rd Worlders. </p>

		<p>Evidentally this is not an issue here in Utah! I have seen so many white families who have adopted a black child, most of the time from some African country, there are often 2-3 natural children and 1-2 adopted black children. I have to wonder about the demographics in the family and what will happen when the black kids grow up and want to date some white girl in high school. These families are going to throw every opportunity at their adopted kids and wonder why they keep falling further and further behind in school and behave in typical black fashion. I have actually seen deluded liberal families say that they WANTED to adopt other racial kids! I can understand adopting when you cannot have children but to not have your own children or add other races into your family is asking for problems. </p>

		<p>Always targeting Whites to adopt nonwhite kids, right? Since nonwhites have NO concern for their own kind, they have to convince Whites that they are &#8220;racists&#8221; if they do not adopt one not of their own kind. Whites have fallen for this scam long enough. Maybe some name calling is in order for these nonwhites who won&rsquo;t care for their own race.  Just like everything else concerning nonwhites, they will sure take but never give. Just like the bone marrow and organ donation article on Amren.</p>
<p>I find it absolutely amazing that most Whites have never figured this out and will still defend their precious nonwhite &#8220;pets&#8221; no matter what they do.</p>

		<p>Sadly that nice cute cuddly black baby will grow up. He will be an uneducatable, unemployable testosterone charged social problem or criminal.</p>
<p>More heartbreak occurs when that dear little asian baby becomes a teenager, she will rebel and want to join up with her own race.</p>
<p>In the meantime the whole thrust of social engineering in the western world is to destroy all of our traditional social values, especially the white english speaking family.</p>
<p>AND. From a distance I look at the only alternative to Obama in the USA is the Tea Party and Sarah Palin! Is this really the best that the once great nation of America can come up with? </p>

		<p>There are plenty of overseas adoptions. So maybe they should consider adopting these children back to where their negligent parents came from.</p>

		<p>Wow-how dysfunctional. Its like setting these children up for mental problems. I grew up in a mexican/american neighborhood-then moved to a white neighborhood and can tell you that it was extremely stressful and different. My upbringing and attitude were shaped by the crime and gangs I grew around. I have never been able to relate to whites and never felt complete until meeting a group of hispanics also from other places to befriend. I would meet the latin model of hispanic then the indegenious mexican and have always been pursued by white women -always. I always felt a terrible emptiness when dating outside and a little embarrassed by it all.However my differences were considered sexy and unique to whites-and white women pursued me so frequently as to make me self conscious about what I wore, and careful about showing them too much attention- as I got tired of the sexy latino role. I grew up in dickies and white Ts and   &mdash;  I think my difference and looks blew it away. Glad I had my mexican upbringing to lead me thru it all -its left me feeling stronger about my mexican american heritage-and longing to be around those like me- yet still to this day I believe white women dont like white men-and any man of color with features not on the extreme end is teh most pursued man in America.</p>

		<p>White babies are adopted immediately.  The only waiting is for non-white children.  And that&rsquo;s largely because so few minorities are even slightly interested in adopting.  Adoption of white babies has become an expensive lottery for scores of prospective white parents.  Unless they are willing to adopt a non-white.  Then the gates of heaven open for them.  Till the ink dries.<br/>

		<p>A few weeks ago at church, I chatted with another young mother as her child played with the Sunday School toys.  I asked if he was her only child, and she said, &#8220;So far, but we&rsquo;re preparing an overseas adoption soon.&#8221;  She said &#8220;overseas adoption&#8221; with this creepy emphasis, while a self-satisfied smirk spread across her face.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t describe how weirdly her face changed when she said that!  It was like she imagined a spotlight shining down on her, while other mothers gathered around and envied her saintliness.  It was unnatural and disturbing.  </p>
<p>Taken aback, I could only reply, &#8220;Oh?&#8221; &hellip;then I watched her little blond son and felt my stomach turn.  Was that poor boy not decorative enough for his mother?  I walked over to my lovely white son and told him I loved him.  <br/>

		<p>After our youngest left the nest for college and then marriage, we had a large empty home. Understandably, my wife suggested we consider taking in foster children. After all, we could afford it, and if the children &#8220;fitted in&#8221;, we could consider adoption.</p>
<p>Accordingly we checked with the local Catholic agencies who were delighted at our willingness to consider fostering one or two children. When we saw what they had to offer, however   &mdash;   older, biracial children, usually from a drug-addicted mother and Black father, we told the staff we wanted time to think. &#8220;To make sure we were ready for the new role.&#8221; Needless to say, the idea of fostering was dropped like a hot potato after that.</p>
<p>Instead, we visited the local animal shelter and took home three cats and a couple of dogs. All five fitting in well and becoming beloved pets in short order. Nor do we need to worry the &#8220;adopted&#8221; pets will steal from us, or worse.</p>

		<p>I remember about 15 years ago I was in a class with a white girl who had 2 children with her husband. Instead of having more of their own children they had decided to have her tubes tied and adopt from overseas! I told her that she was nuts and I got yelled at for being so ungenerous at not wanting a child who didnt have a home to have a good one. I just shrugged and walked off. I have also seen people who adopted Russian or other Eastern European children ending up with kids with emotional, mental or even physical health problems and I would venture a bet that many of these kids ended up in our own clogged foster care system when their adoptive parents decided the problem was too much for them. If you look at abuse statistics you will see that many times abuse in middle class and upper middle class families happens to adoptive children. For whatever selfish reason the woman has waited too late for biological children or decided to limit her own children to one child and adopt some sort of third world child or go to the &#8220;kid pound&#8221; to get some probable conduct disordered kid. They think everything will be rosy but when the rubber hits the road after the kid is about 3 years old at the time of the adoption they almost never bond fully with an adoptive parent and abuse can result. </p>

<p>YOU are wrong on so many counts.   Who are you trying to kid? White women don&rsquo;t like White men and only like the &#8220;colored&#8221; men?  I find it amusing to say the least that nonwhite men such as yourself have to build up their egos by claiming us White women find you attractive. Believe me, that is a lie. I know alot of White women and not ONE has or wants an nonwhite partner. </p>
<p>You are spouting another MYTH since you are a Mexican and love to think White women &#8220;love&#8221; your kind. Your aim is to take jabs a WHITE MEN, period and you have failed miserably.</p>

		<p>Anon13- I think that White men are so feminized by leftist female school teachers, medicated for normal masculine behavior and told that they are &#8220;opressers&#8221; ad nauseaum that white women too often run the other direction. This is another reason for the offshore adoptions- so many men are in an arrested state of development that women give up and visit a fertility dr or adopt. </p>

<p>There was at least one book written by a white christian girl, from a family who adopted black children into their home. The family or at least the father was really strict and a religious fundamentalist. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t read the story but apparently the black boy rapes the girl, and she doesn&rsquo;t have the gumption to tell her parents or call the cops. From the reviews, she seems to be most angry at her fundamentalist parents, not for the adoption and the rape, but because they were strict on her and oppressive. I guess school teaching really can make the difference.  </p>

		<p>Remember&hellip;if you&rsquo;re white and have white kids, child services will take them away from you and you will no longer have contact with them. <br/>
BUT, If you&rsquo;re Haitian living in Haiti and have a haitian child, or African-american living in Africa and you have an african child&hellip;well&hellip;let&rsquo;s just ask Sally Struthers about this one if we all remember the continuous commercials from the past.</p>
<p>OH, and lets not forget the ones who have black children in africa and haiti, and are fully aware of what their child will live through before their kids are born&hellip;WHO punishes the parents of THOSE kids!? </p>

		<p>Not long ago, one of these wonderful black adoptees beat his white mother to death. This happened in Canada, but hardly made the news.</p>
<p>She was likely disappointed that he didn&rsquo;t grow up to be an ambitious yuppie. One day he suddenly grabbed a pipe and killed her, because she had scolded him about not doing his chores.</p>
<p>It seemed he never developed a love for her, even though she had raised him from infanthood.</p>

		<p>&#8216;How clever&rsquo;.. to teach natures more sucessful humans to replace themselves (at their expense) with their competition. This is like a healthy husband paying another man to copulate and impregnate his wife and he in turn raise the offspring&hellip; &#8216;How caring and sharing&rsquo;..and racially sado-masocistic)&hellip; Yrs ago I remember a girl I met on a vacation that was bent on an unhealthy passion to jump in the sack with nearly any guy &hellip; her sister confiding in me&hellip; the reason being&hellip; their father was a preacher who adopted a mess of kids and really denied his own blood the love they needed. Sado masochism is not the Virtue some &#8216;selfless ones&rsquo; would have us believe. This is not to deny that to deny the self before God is a virtue&hellip; it is a virtue.. But to replace your own kind with another is suicide&hellip; not a virtue!</p>
