			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Worthington, Toronto Sun, November 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you want to know what the social, cultural and racial trend is in Europe  &mdash;  and every country is different  &mdash;  look no further than Denmark.</p>
<p>No country adopted multiculturalism and ethnic tolerance with the enthusiasm and idealism of Denmark.</p>
<p>Some countries had little choice but to accept an influx of people with different and conflicting values and mores. When its African colonies gained independence, and when Algeria broke away after a bitter war, France became home to millions of displaced Arabs.</p>
<p>Portugal, Spain, and even Britain became the new home for many who felt they had to move from the land of their birth. Newcomers adjusted in varying degrees of harmony and resentment.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, no country was as welcoming as Denmark to newcomers. Danes had no obligation to encourage outsiders  &mdash;  but it did. Perhaps Denmark was influenced by its gallant record of standing up to the Nazi occupation in the Second World War  &mdash;  not with guns and bombs, but by its response to the order that all Jews be rounded up and sent to a concentration camp.</p>
<p>In defiance, an enterprising and heroic underground network spirited 7,200 of Jews out of Denmark, mostly on fishing vessels, to safety in Sweden, a national action that spoke volumes.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Denmark&rsquo;s socialist government has tried to look after every citizen. Regarding immigrants, it sought to avoid mistakes of other countries, and ensure that newcomers could integrate and blend with Danes and feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Denmark&rsquo;s crime rate was one of the lowest in Europe; its education system was excellent and available to all; its humanitarianism beyond repute. Denmark&rsquo;s history of pillaging Vikings succumbed to generous welfare to immigrants, plus housing and other amenities that it hoped would set an example for the world in multicultural inclusiveness.</p>
<p>To a great degree it worked. But not with Muslims, who chose not to integrate, but to live in self-chosen ghettos where Danish liberalism and tolerance were seen as decadent and offensive.</p>
<p>This all came to a head in 2005 when an obscure magazine published 12 political cartoons featuring Mohammed. Months later, streets in parts or the world ran with blood, the cartoonists&rsquo; lives were threatened, Islamic outrage caused the rest of the world to shudder, cringe and apologize for allegedly showing disrespect to the Prophet. Denmark retreated.</p>
<p>The western media largely refused to publish the Danish cartoons  &mdash;  pretending to be motivated by principle rather than fear of Islamic reprisals.</p>
<p>Daniel Pipes is one who anticipated the Muslim collision in Denmark. In 2002 he noted that Muslims in Denmark comprise 4% of the population (5.5 million), but get 40% of available welfare payments. He also claimed the majority of convicted rapists are Muslim.</p>
<p>Pipes&rsquo; claims were later disputed by Danish parliamentarians, who say his numbers just don&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>Muslims want Sharia law in Denmark. Forced marriages exist (promising newborn daughters to male cousins in the home country); Muslims who convert to Christianity are threatened with death; women are forced to cover their faces, fearing male vengeance, Pipes claims.</p>
<p>Anti-Israel marches turn into anti Jewish protests.</p>
<p>Like other European countries (Germany, France, Holland, Belgium) opposition is growing against multiculturalism  &mdash;  now seen as a failure.</p>
<p>Russia, China  &mdash;  even the U.S. and Canada  &mdash;  have growing unease about the militancy of Muslims, and are called bigots.</p>
<p>As Ezra Levant noted in a column, only in Canada would an appeal court judge rule that before a veiled women must show her face while testifying, she can ask for an order to clear the courtroom of males  &mdash;  including staff, opposition lawyers, even the judge himself.</p>
<p>Another triumph of multiculturalism? No, but it looks to be the future.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Another triumph of multiculturalism? No, but it looks to be the future.&#8221;: This is Liberaism heading to its logical end.  That end being the replacement/death of the Liberal (Western) culture by whichever agressive culture (Islam for now) is there to take over.  If we go out with a wimper, then at some point in the future whoever remains of Western influence will either convert or be killed.  The only other future path will be, once again, where we have the far left (Liberalism) leading to the rise of the far right and eventually a bloody battle for cultural supremacy.  Why it is we fight this same fight over and over again is to me, just idiotic.  We wouldn&rsquo;t have to fight the Muslims or talk of sending them back if we hadn&rsquo;t let them in in the first place.</p>

		<p>The funny thing is that the left is now getting upset because their new Muslim guests are competing for resources that they have come to feel entitled to.  There is only so much of a surplus that any given number of people can produce.  Therefore, you can only have so many single mommies, deadbeats, layabouts, and third generation Muslim baby factories.  </p>

		<p>The Sun is a demoralizing propaganda rag that makes regular complaints and then says we have to accept it anyway but it&rsquo;s probably the least toxic paper in Canada. Nobody should naively interpret many comments on a web page as meaning anything. Complaining and organized action are unrelated, one doesn&rsquo;t predict the other. A Tea Party in Canada is impossible bc hard-core rural maritime White British Canadian farmers &amp; fishermen are bankrupt and depend on Welfare as much as urban 3rd Worlders</p>

<p>You two make it sound so simmple.  But you are forgetting that Hitler hated the West and was attacking the U.S. first in words, then through agents inside the U.S. and later with submarines that operated just off the East coast, so close in that NYC for example, had to &#8220;blackout,&#8221; in order not to create silhouettes of ships, which they sank in droves anyway.  And you forget the very uneasy alliance with the USSR at the time.  The Nazis ravaged Eastern Europe and Russia as they advanced.  20 million Russians died, many through mass executions by German forces.  I think I can understand why Russian soldiers were so bitterly vengeful.  Not only that, but many GIs raped in Europe too.  America went from being hailed as heroes in France to being unwelcomed very soon due to this, as they also did in Italy.  GIs were actually constrained to behave themselves better in Germany than the rest of Europe. </p>
<p>But there is one point that I agree with; The European sparked world wars were really civil wars.  Most of the cause of these modern conflicts actually lay in the 17th century Thirty Years War, which was a European civil war between Catholics and Prostestant nations and populations.  That is why Marxism has at least one point correct, &#8220;Religion is the opium of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I also agree with the distaste for the celebration of America that one can view on for example, The Military Channel, where dvd series on The Nazis seems to carry a PC message with it.</p>

<p>I agree 100%. After WWII Frankfurt School Cultural Marxism/political correctness and its nation-wreckers covertly took over the national institutions of most Western nations demonising Western Civilisation as racist, homophobic and needing to be destroyed. Nothing suffered more than nationalism (which only recently has had a European-wide revival after 60 years) due to Nuremberg, where Nazi leaders went on trial, &amp; all nationalism, was deliberately demonised as Fascism &amp; nationalists as Nazis. This how the EU Marxist/globalist elite managed post-WWII to demonise nationalism and build what eventually has become the Marxist/globalist European Union. </p>
<p>All the while Communism, which killed tens of millions of Orthodox Christians, has never been called to account. Strange that. Well, not really, when you see MEPs such as Daniel &#8220;Dany the Red&#8221; Cohn-Bendit (now a Green &amp; friend of the US neo-cons) &amp; &#8220;Martin Schulz&#8221; &amp; all those &#8220;ex-Marxists&#8221;, Fabian Socialists and assorted fellow travellers in the unelected EU Commission, the real power in the EU while the elected MEPs are only there, prodded by Marxists like the Red &amp; Schulz, to rubber-stamp the policies of the Marxist EU Commissioners. The rise of European nationalism has been followed by a corresponding increase in totalitarian laws aimed at halting nationalism in EU member-states. In the UK just today the pro-EU Con/Lib Dem coalition government have put forward a Bill which will prevent members of the nationalist BNP, a perfectly legal party, from teaching in schools, though the BNP is awaiting another expensive court case on Nov 8 which will confirm their legal standing (until these Marxist/globalist criminals come up with some new ploy to halt the power of the people).</p>
<p>My advice (for what it&rsquo;s worth) would be never to let these nation-wreckers enter your country or in a generation or two you may not have a country left, as many have found out to their profound regret.</p>

		<p>For five years I&rsquo;ve been writing on this site that, &#8220;We will have to do nothing to bring down this nonsense diversity concept, but sit, wait and be prepared, because multiculturalism/multiracialism is an abject failure&hellip;totally against human nature&hellip;.and will implode all on its own.&#8221;  And that is exactly what is happening.</p>
<p>More and more every day, we are reading of instances where it is being rejected in Europe.  And, in this country, giving homes to mostly non-whites who couldn&rsquo;t afford the mortgage payments resulted in a world economic collapse that is declining into a world wide depression.</p>
<p>But, it will be a turn to violence, crime and chaos that will signal the end to this concept promoted by elitist fools and forced upon us.  It won&rsquo;t be long now.  The situation will continue to decline rapidly.</p>

		<p>World War I was actually started when the Russian empire invaded East Prussia in 1914 with the very strong approval of France and Britain, neither one of which had been attacked or threatened by Germany at that point but had mobilized their armed forces against her anyway. These were the FIRST shots fired that signalled the beginning of that conflict. Germany was the LAST country in Europe to mobilize it&rsquo;s forces and the Kaiser was frantically sending messages to all the other European powers in a vain effort to avoid all out conflict. It was not Germany who wanted war. It was Britain, France and Russia. The Serbian, Austria-Hungary sideshow was an excuse not the cause of the war. Everyone thinks that Germany totally lost WWI but forget that it had won the war against Russia in the east and was thus a conquerer until the U.S. entered the war on the allies side and the war was lost in the west. The Eastern victories were then  rescinded. Germany agreed to an armistace, not a surrender, under the terms of Wilson&rsquo;s 14 points but when they showed up for the signing of the agreement they were told that all the terms had been changed and they had better sign or war would start up again. Germany signed under duress but vowed vengence as 14% of it&rsquo;s territory was torn from her and communist upheavels tore at her soul while the allies stood by rubbing their hands in glee at Germany&rsquo;s destruction and starved 1 million more of her people to death through a food blockade that endured for a year AFTER the armistace was signed. Was WWII something that had to have happened? Would Hitler or some other dictator have risen to power if the allies had allowed the war to end honorably for Germany? Why was Germany blamed for all the destruction when the Kaiser was the only major belligerent who tried to stop the escalation and war hysteria? I propose that if the allies had acted honorably at the termination of that first major conflict there was an excellent chance that WWII would never have happened and 50 million white lives may have been spared and the Islamization of Europe and third world immigration would not be an issue. The problems of the white world today are the direct result of the policies of Britain and France as colonial powers with their never ending ambitions to control the world. Two world wars ended their empires and with that all the doors of marxist contagion were thrown wide open. I make no excuses for the atrocities commited by Germany in WWII but neither do I make excuses for the exceptional barbarity of the allies fire bombing cities full of women and children and old people. When WWII had ended the allies stood by as another 2 1/2 million German civilians died during forced marches out of lands they had lived in for centuries. Millions of German pow&rsquo;s were worked to death and shot for sport when they didn&rsquo;t instantaneously obey an order given them. The entire blame for the plight of the white world does not lie at Germany&rsquo;s door. The allies played a very large role themselves.</p>

		<p>Eric #3 and Anon #8: Yes, the world was saved from the Germans, who attacked an evil Empire, as Ronald Reagan called it, which was responsible for the murdering purges of its own Officer Corp during the 1930s, and the Soviet Union&rsquo;s mass starvation of 10 million Ukrainians. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the annexation of the three Baltic States, and the invasion of Finland, which refused to capitulate to it.</p>

That is all very  true. Unfortunately,  the rest of the world does not see it in that same light (or is not allowed to see it that way - as  having any sort of  racial basis or connection).  Thus, the object lesson is lost, except for racially aware  realists such as those here at Amren. </p>
<p>Others will blame the banks, government policies, interest rates, construction costs,  blah, blah &hellip;. simply ANYTHING except the unmentionable topic of race.  That is so far from their minds, so totally forbidden a thought (due to a lifetime of brainwashing), that it would not even occur to them.  </p>

		<p>The &#8220;second generation immigrant&#8221; problem in Denmark (mostly from Somalia, Turkey, and Pakistan) is much like our problem with the second generation from Mexico and Central America: the youth feel like outsiders and act out with crime, aberrant culture (rap, hip-hop clothing), and unabashed attempts to exploit the welfare system. </p>
<p>Historically, there is a second generation crime problem with almost all immigrant ethnic groups (the Irish and Italians in the US are conspicuous examples). Perhaps the best policy would be to terminate immigration, completely. </p>

		<p>WW2 was NOT a &#8220;good war&#8221;. It was a tragedy for all Whites worldwide, even more so then the senseless &#8220;great&#8221; war (ww1). If anyone wants a different take on the traditional propaganda three excellent books are NO CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, THE ILLUSION OF VICTORY &amp; Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s book CHURCHILL AND HITLER, THE UNNECCESARRY WAR. </p>
