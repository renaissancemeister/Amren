<h1>Hassan Charged With Harassment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Gryta, Buffalo News, Nov. 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Muzzamil S. &#8220;Mo&#8221; Hassan was charged Friday with misdemeanor harassment and obstruction for the Erie County Holding Center disturbance he blamed on &#8220;white Nazis&#8221; who patrol the downtown lockup.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a court appearance Wednesday for his upcoming trial for the decapitation slaying of his estranged wife, Hassan complained that up to 16 &#8220;white Nazi&#8221; guards attacked him Nov. 10, leaving him fearful that he will be killed and his death called a suicide.</p>
<p>Also during the appearance, Hassan said he was waterboarded.</p>
<p>In a legal turnabout, Hassan is charged with attacking the Holding Center guard he had accused in court of attacking him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Undersheriff Mark N.] Wipperman called Hassan &#8220;a troublesome and problematic inmate&#8221; since his incarceration after the Feb. 12, 2009, beheading of his estranged wife, a week after she had begun divorce proceedings.</p>
<p>In City Court papers filed Friday, Hassan is accused of verbally and physically assaulting the Holding Center officer.</p>
<p>At about 8:45 p. m. Nov. 10, Hassan cursed and lunged at the guard after he had ordered Hassan and other inmates to get into their cells for nightly lockup, according to court papers.</p>
<p>The guard told superiors Hassan struck him in the chest and right arm. &#8220;Acting in self-defense,&#8221; the guard said, he wrestled Hassan to the floor until other guards came to his aid.</p>
<p>Though Hassan claimed he was bleeding following the disturbance, an examination showed no bleeding on Hassan and neither he nor the guard involved in the incident appeared injured.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hassan has been diagnosed by one psychiatrist as suffering from &#8220;battered spouse syndrome.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think by &#8220;white Nazi,&#8221; Hassan means just any plain ole white man who doesn&rsquo;t look like he spends five hours a day inside a coffee house.</p>
<p>Is Hassan a real Middle Easterner, or is he a black man who converted to Islam at some point in the past?</p>

		<p>This Mohammedan beast has evidently learned well from amerikan blacks, that the proper response to any outside stimulus is to scream &#8220;White Nazis&#8221; until every White in sight collapses beneath the weight of liberal guilt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to see that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working, apparently due to the enormity of his crime.  All the same, I can&rsquo;t help but  wonder if Hassan would have been treated so tolerantly by the amerikan legal system had he been a lowly White nationalist.<br>

&hellip;after the Feb. 12, 2009, beheading of his estranged wife, a week after she had begun divorce proceedings.<br>

Hassan has been diagnosed by one psychiatrist as suffering from &ldquo;battered spouse syndrome.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>At least from my pop psychology understanding of spousal abuse, the typical feelings are ones of entrapment and inability to escape a hostile environment.  Not ones of&hellip;you know, losing the &#8216;ol family punching bag.</p>
<p>Oh well, learn something new every day.  I tell&rsquo;ya what old man, you want to be a &#8216;spouse&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Queen For A Day.</p>
<p>Allocute to everything you did.  Pack up your kids and such of your property as will fit into four large suitcases.</p>
<p>Call a cab.  And ask for your plane tickets at the airport.  </p>
<p>Never come back.</p>
<p>Rather than waste umpteen thousand dollars in putting you on death row for the next 25 to life, I would really just prefer to let your home country deal with you, even if your actions are accepted as par for the course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry Mrs. Hassan, you&rsquo;re past hurting and it&rsquo;s pretty clear he&rsquo;s a waste of DNA in our gene pool.  There are people who could use the cash from a prosecution better.</p>
<p>If anything, this should serve as an object lesson in the consequences of marrying into this guy&rsquo;s culture to the rest of the worlds women.  Especially ours.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t save you from your inherited or willed stupidity ladies.  Not into being the heroes anymore.</p>

		<p>Why is this noble muslim being persecuted like this? He being unfairly singled out and accused of doing what any ordinary person would do when dealing with marital discord, that is, decapitating the spouse. Perhaps in his country of origin he would have been written a ticket and fined for being disorderly. How is he supposed to know that the laws here may be different? Oh, and why is his nickname &#8220;Mo&#8221;? Is he a fan of the Three Stooges, perhaps?  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sick of liberals, blacks, or civil liberties types who find common sense in their way blaming &#8220;Nazis&#8221; or Nazi practices. Are these whiners alive? Are they in possession of their minds(such as they were before confronting &#8220;Nazis&#8221;?). Are they able to continue their preaching and whining to fools who believe that losers are victims and victims are winners?  Then, these complainers haven&rsquo;t met a real Nazi, a Himmler, a storm trooper circa 1932, or a Heydrich. Why? Because if they had met such real Nazis, their opinions would be as apparent as their cells, i.e., unperceivable to the five senses.</p>

		<p>Typical of the fruit loop &#8220;science&#8221; of psychiatry, and it&rsquo;s practitioners.  The guy beheads his wife in an honor killing, and HE is suffering from battered spouse syndrome?<br>
The psychiatrist is nuttier than Hassan!  </p>

		<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s possible Hassan could be telling the truth about being attacked by the guards. And that should certainly be investigated. But my instincts tell me not to trust a guy who CHOPPED HIS WIFE&rsquo;S HEAD OFF!!!</p>
<p><i>Hassan has been diagnosed by one psychiatrist as suffering from &ldquo;battered spouse syndrome.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>She was probably hitting him while he was CHOPPING HER HEAD OFF!!!</p>

<p>  That just doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a good way to resolve marital difficulties. Could there be some cultural differences at work? I&rsquo;m a little skeptical of the &#8220;water boarding&#8221; charge as it seems too newsworthy and predictable. When it suits their needs, even gruesome murderers can play the minority victim card. I&rsquo;m sure some members of the controlled press and minority rights groups believe Mr. Hassan. We&rsquo;ve certainly allowed a fine bunch of people to immigrate to this country in the last few decades. </p>

		<p>He cut a woman&rsquo;s head off. He deserves to be &#8216;mistreated&rsquo; by &#8216;white Nazis&rsquo;. Batter spouse syndrome? Yeah right. I&rsquo;m sure his wife, who had her head hacked off, would disagree. Why is up with these cuckoo psychologists?</p>

		<p>The Eerie County Undersheriff overseeing Hassan&rsquo;s detention is named Mark Wipperman. </p>
<p>I think a more appropriate name for him would be : &#8220;Whimperman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Third World reasoning is not compatible Western Civilization. These people have objective morality issues that are hard-wired into their brains, and that no amount of disingenuous wishful thinking white liberal utopianism can correct. </p>
<p>This man should be tried in a Sharia-compliant court of law, In-Shallah, preferably in a setting of minarets and sand dunes.   </p>

		<p>I remember reading about the killing of his wife a few months ago. The ironic part of the whole case is that he and his wife launched the TV station the goal of which was to dispel negative stereotypes about Muslims.<br>
If it weren&rsquo;t so hideous it&rsquo;d be hilarious. </p>
