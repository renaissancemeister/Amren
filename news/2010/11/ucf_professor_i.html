<h1>UCF Professor: I Was Fired Over Offensive Book</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WKMG-TV (Orlando), Nov. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Younger blacks prefer the term African American, whereas older African Americans may use the terms Negro or colored.&#8221; </p>
<p>Statements like that in &#8220;The Guide to Culturally Competent Health Care&#8221; are meant to teach nursing students how to interact with patients from different cultures, but former University of Central Florida professor Dr. Nancy Rudner Lugo believes the book is racially offensive and loaded with inaccurate stereotypes.</p>
<p>After complaining about the book to school officials in April 2008, Rudner Lugo claims the university refused to renew her teaching contract. </p>
<p>According to a federal lawsuit filed against UCF&rsquo;s Board of Trustees, Rudner Lugo claims she and her students were troubled by several generalizations in the book, such as &#8220;most (Haitians) do not respect clock time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.punctuality is not valued.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book also states that, in the Cuban culture, &#8220;Being overweight is seen as positive, healthy, and sexually attractive,&#8221; and &#8220;Some Mexicans use alcohol to make them emotionally and socially extroverted and are more likely to engage in binge drinking.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, UCF originally claimed that Rudner Lugo had received extremely poor evaluations from her own students. She said university officials later accused her of refusing to accept a teaching assignment. However, the former professor claims she was terminated from UCF because she tried to get the book removed from the nursing program curriculum.</p>
<p>University officials are unable to comment on the specific allegations made in Rudner Lugo&rsquo;s lawsuit. However, according to a university spokesman, &#8220;The UCF College of Nursing&rsquo;s curriculum aims to provide students with the best resources and guidance available so they are well prepared to care for patients of all ages, cultures and backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The university said the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reviewed a complaint about the dismissal and said it was &#8220;unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of statutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCF Assistant Vice President Grant Heston said the university believes the lawsuit is without merit. </p>

		<p>As a former auditor of the State University System (SUS) of Florida I have first hand knowledge of UCF.  The faculty and other staff are for the most part what we all wish for if our children were to attend an institution of higher education.  They are moderate in their views and put the students first over political issues.  Besides, many of the students are local commuters and live at home.  The Orlando area is still fairly conservative and most parents demand a proper education.  So it was not with surprise that this trouble maker was booted from the University.  Perhaps Nancy Rudner-Lugo could hit up her pals at the League of Women Voters of Orange County for a job.  I wonder if she also has a problem saying the Pledge?   </p>

		<p>As usual, the EE NO SEE is useless. </p>
<p>Everyone in this tale also seems utterly useless,however. I heard of this yet another Florida state college, hrumph, only because it&rsquo;s in a major football conference, the Big East. </p>
<p>The Big East used to have real colleges, mostly private Catholic colleges, as members. Now, to make TV money, it is mostly public second and third tier schools with the usual misfits on teams and the usual high school &#8220;grads&#8221; as the &#8220;students&#8221; with their under 500 SAT scores in Math and Verbal as the audience for the faculty.  </p>
<p>I will say that these multicultural high schools posing as colleges are no more guilty of political correctness, unchallenging texts, and disdain for original works of great Western thinkers than the Ivies and the elite publics like Michigan and Berkeley. Their degrees are all pretty much worthless in the social sciences and humanities. </p>
<p>Hopefully the sciences survive, but then fewer US born students enroll in the sciences given the pathetic state of our high schools obsessed with standardized tests rather than development of programs for the gifted and elite from elementary on. </p>
<p>Ah, equality is such a virtue! Not.</p>

		<p>If for no other than strategic reasons, this is the sort of thing AmRen needs to talk about more   &mdash;   a professor is terminated for writing an honest book containing ethnic generalities, as a part of teaching future professionals how to deal with different ethnicities.</p>
<p>Start with things like this, and eventually work up to &#8220;what can we do about slums, if we can&rsquo;t change the fact that they&rsquo;re filled with low IQ blacks.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Funny how I`m now old enough to have  been a part of this process. When I was a kid, it was during the changing of the term Negro to Black. I could see the reasoning behind it. Dropping &#8220;our&#8221; term for them in favor of &#8220;their&#8221; term for them.<br>
 So I`ve always stuck with Black. Because it was what they wanted. But now when I use it I am chastised by Whites who say I should use the term African American. First, I tell them that they aren`t &#8220;Black&#8221; so why are they preaching to me? Then I tell them if it`s good enough for Stokley Carmicheal and those Mexico City 440 Relay guys it`s good enough for me. Finally I say I am an economist. When they ask what money has to do with it I respond, &#8220;Af-ri-can A-mer-i-can or Black. I just saved six sylables on a subject I`d prefer not talk about to begin with&hellip;<br>
One man waited until my browbeating was over and said quietly he preferred the TWO syllable word&hellip; Trou-BLE!!</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it nice that they&rsquo;re so solicitous about the feelings of some people that blacks (and minorities) are allowed to pick whatever terms they prefer to describe themselves?</p>
<p>If only we were the recipients of such concern!  When it comes to whites on the right, such as Amreners, we are automatically branded as  &#8220;extremists&#8221;,  &#8220;supremecists&#8221;, &#8220;racists&#8221;,  &#8220;nazis&#8221;, bigots&#8221;, etc.   And no matter how much we object and try to explain ourselves, our voices go unheeded. </p>
<p>They arbitrarily define us; we are not allowed to define ourselves. Why the discrepancy?</p>
<p>So much for the great lovers of &#8220;equality&#8221;! </p>

		<p>Not being an expert on cuban, Haitian, Mexican or black culture around the nation, I must admit I wondered at the copyright date of a book that refered to African Americans as preferring &#8216;colored&rsquo; or &#8216;negro&rsquo; as self identification references, even among the elderly of that population.</p>
<p>A decade into the new millenium I would expect most who had last seen that era in the 1950s and 60s as adults to have passed.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Rudner Lugo claimed she suggested several other books that could achieve the same educational goals, but UCF officials insisted on using the current textbook.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2a3vcr8</p>
<p>As an illustrative exercise in &#8216;doing your homework&rsquo; for both balanced (I despise the word -claimed- by a reporter) journalism and in providing us a better insight to Ms. Lugo&rsquo;s mindset, it would have been interesting to hear excerpts from these alternative textbook suggestions she made.  Or at least to know what ranking they had vs. Mr. Purnell&rsquo;s work as core texts in the Nursing education field.</p>

		<p>@2 - What college/university did you end up going to, where you call UCF a &#8216;multicultural high school posing as a college&rsquo; ?  </p>
<p>It is the largest university in the state of Florida, and the 2nd largest in the US by enrollement.  Hardly rinky-dink.  </p>
<p>I wanted to go to UCF as they had an amazing computer sciences and engineering department, but ended up at another FL state university b/c of finances.  Central FL is still very Old South in most areas.  FL is not Miami or &#8216;Boca&rsquo; as is CA just SF and LA (check the prop 8 and prop 19 votes again to see just how conservative the state is, regardless of racial makeup)  Yes, like most universities, they have their football team 90%+ minority, of which all are on some kind of athletic scholarship.   I got to see Southern Mississippi&rsquo;s team the other day - guess what - all black, so what? They had a few white cheerleaders, tho, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re only useful in the locker room before and after games.  </p>

<p>take another look at the RANKINGS section before giving your Frenchman&rsquo;s wave and dismissing this school.  </p>
<p>@3 -  &#8220;a professor is terminated for writing an honest book containing ethnic generalities, as a part of teaching future professionals how to deal with different ethnicities.&#8221;</p>
<p>read again.  This professor was terminated for &#8216;complaining&rsquo; about a book - this professor did not write this book at all.  This article is most &#8216;backwards&rsquo; from what we&rsquo;re used to reading about from Universities.  As said in another comment:   this is something we&rsquo;d wish to see in other schools.  The squeaky wheel gets replaced.  </p>

		<p>I DO wish some posters would read and comprehend the article before posting.  It was not the author of the book fired - it was the malcontent BLACK professor who complained AGAINST the book.  Fired, most likely, because her latest complaint against a book trying to educate nurses how to be sensitive and deal with ethnic patients &#8220;offended&#8221; her - probably as so many other things offended her in her history with this college - last straw.  You&rsquo;re fired.  Take a hike.  The black trouble-making professor was fired, not the author of the book.  Makes a big difference in how one responds to the article.  The college stood up for the author and the common sense approach text book and fired the black trouble-maker.</p>

		<p>The AmRen administrator has a good point on this one. &#8216;Cultural competence&rsquo; is stereotypes. You can bet non-whites will be offended either way and that no one will be concerned with identifying with whites, only identifying them as oppressors. </p>

		<p>This article makes it very clear to me that we need a universally accepted term for Blacks that doesn&rsquo;t change as often as their hairstyles. My personal choice would be those-who-are-no-longer-among-us, but it&rsquo;s kind of long and won&rsquo;t be accurate anytime soon, so I doubt that it will catch on. </p>

		<p>1  &mdash;  Anonymous: Thanks for your local knowledge  &mdash;  this is what makes AmRen so worthwhile  &mdash;  that people who know the inside story speak up. My own experience is that most universities in the South have decent faculties, not blinded by political correctness, and that our children would gain  &mdash;  not lose  &mdash;  by sitting in their classrooms. One nice consequence of fiscal contraction (coming to every state next year) is that trouble-makers will be more likely to be booted out the door&hellip; So, brothers and sisters, keep up the pressure&hellip;</p>

		<p>Here in Germany, it is still correct to use the term &#8220;Neger,&#8221; which I always do, although more and more Germans look uncomfortable when I say it.  It sound close enough to the &#8220;n&#8221; word to bring me a little pleasure. </p>

		<p>From what I understand, Jesse Jackson came up with the term &#8220;African-American&#8221; and demanded that everyone use it.  <br>
When I was a kid, &#8220;colored&#8221; was the polite term to use, although &#8220;Negro&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t thought to be perjorative.  Then along came &#8220;black&#8221;, which is at least one syllable and is co-equal with &#8220;white&#8221;.  The AA term is much too cumbersome for daily usage.  </p>

		<p>Thanks to the commentator who correctly notes that Central Fla U is not in the Big East. Southern Florida is, and exerts the same downward drag on that once classy conference that I misattributed to Central Florida. As for the alum of UCF who seems a little miffed at my cynicism about the quality of CentralFlorida, I shall of course defer to his first-hand experience and rejoice that he received a fine education there. However, the fact that UCF is very &#8220;large&#8221;, which weighs heavily in the commentator&rsquo;s thinking, does not translate into quality for any college or university. Nothing is larger than the UCal system, but only a few struggling departments on a couple of its far-flung campuses remain of national quality. For a quality but expensive private education on the undergrad level, the nonexciting, relatively non-athletic schools like Amherst, Franklin &amp; Marshall, Lafayette, Williams,Tufts, Miami of Ohio, Pomona, Harvey Mudd, and Haverford remain the best. There remain a few quality small Catholic colleges as well where ethnic studies and &#8220;communications&#8221; don&rsquo;t outrank in popularity (?)philosophy, French/Italian, English and even world history (not to be confused with Latino or African American History)</p>
<p>Everywhere you put up with PC drivel, but at the small private colleges you still can learn to think for yourself. You want to learn a trade: plenty of options online and in the local state college campuses. Nothing wrong with the locals; just don&rsquo;t confuse them with &#8220;college&#8221;education.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s really only ONE way to determine these things, regardless of who claims to be &#8220;offended&#8221;, and this is: Do the statements contain a reasonable amount of truth, or not? Correct or incorrect? Are they true or are they false?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;most (Haitians) do not respect clock time&hellip;punctuality is not valued.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>True or false?</p>
<p><i>[&hellip;] in the Cuban culture, &ldquo;Being overweight is seen as positive, healthy, and sexually attractive,&rdquo;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>True or false?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Some Mexicans use alcohol to make them emotionally and socially extroverted and are more likely to engage in binge drinking.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>True or false?</p>
<p>If these things are false, the textbook should be corrected. If they&rsquo;re true   &mdash;   and I think we all know that they are   &mdash;   then this complaint should be DISMISSED. <br>

		<p>Anonymous - thanks for providing that link showing the whiner fired was white.<br>
Her complaint, action, and conduct would have led one to believe she was black.<br>
All the more reason to fire her, being white, and acting like an aggrieved black.  In the first place, how would SHE know what aggrieves blacks?  She isn&rsquo;t black.  Secondly, why is SHE criticizing the book which is making an honest attempt to train nurses in sensitivity?  Was HER book or paper rejected for consideration?  Jealousy between her and the author?  The author got advancement or perks SHE thought were due her?<br>
At any rate, here&rsquo;s yet another White acting Black, whining like a black, disgruntled like a black, with an attitude of entitlement which finally got her fired.  Great.  </p>
