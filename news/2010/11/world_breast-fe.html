		<p>In a sick sort of way, this photo is appropriate because it symboloizes the black, non-white world sucking the life out of the white world.  Maybe this image will wake some people up?</p>
<p>I find it really concerning that a child would be set up and encouraged to act as a real mother, far beyond playing with a doll, but actually simulating breast feeding, something that one this young would be completely innocent minded about.  Setting her up with a black doll is so heavy handed that it HAS to get some negative reactions nearby.  That is, unless they are already all robots.</p>

The photo is used to encourage young girls to beastfeed when they get older. Clearly the people who made the ad believe this will be the result. What then are we to make of the fact that this white girl is mock-breastfeeding a black doll?</p>

		<p>This borders on child abuse, and despite the disgusting &#8216;diversity&rsquo; of color, color here takes second place in my repulsion.</p>
<p>Using a child this age to display an act that she should have almost no knowledge of, and what an adult should/should not do is unspeakable.</p>
<p>Nursing a child in public shows a distinct lack of class. There are some things in life that just don&rsquo;t need to be flaunted. There are many ways to descreetly remove oneself from public view when the need arises, but most people now are just to self absorbed and refuse to alter their lifestyle a bit to accommodate raising children. I hear many young mothers say, &#8220;My child isn&rsquo;t going to change my way of life.&#8221; Well, if it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>To those who say &#8220;Nursing is a natural act.&#8221;  - so is vomiting and diarrhea, but no one wants to witness it.</p>

<p>No. The agenda is very clear. Love blacks as your own and especially black men so you too can have a real live black baby. No White can breastfeed a black baby without giving birth in the first place.</p>

		<p>The website the article is from is a French equivalent to AmRen.  &#8220;F. Desouche&#8221; is a very good nationalistic website. I have no idea as to its readership (although 1,000 readers were online when I visited their site and the site has had over 35,000,000 unique visits).  The name translates roughly to &#8220;old stock&#8221; or native French.  Given the nature of the website, the comments are unsurprisingly repulsed and disgusted with the theme and indoctrinatory nature of the ad campaign.  As a side note, I was talking recently with a few French ex-patriots who have recently joined the exodus of Frenchmen fleeing France.  They tell me the main reason for their immigration is the invasion of les maghrebiens (North Africans)and its concomitant soaring crime.  Apparently, France, after 6pm, is basically on lockdown mode.  The French are extremely angry but, like us, have nowhere to turn&hellip;yet.  Don&rsquo;t give up on Western Europe, we will get through this together.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Do the French think that this is okay? All the comments are in French, so does anyone know French?&#8221;     &mdash;   Kitty</p>
<p>They mean literally what they say in English:  &#8220;When I am big, I will give milk to my baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time this little girl reaches twenty, it will seem perfectly natural for her to have a black baby (and a black baby-daddy, it goes wihout saying).  How many young minds are being warped in this manner?</p>
<p>I know of a woman who is involved with breastfeeding programs, who saw nothing surprising in this picture. You only notice these things when your antennae are up.  However, the larger point is that it is not just one isolated picture, but is part of an on-going, constant, barrage of such propaganda that is fed to us daily via TV and magazines.  And now even to young children!  That can be no accident. </p>

		<p>First impression on the image above &#8216;Yuck&rsquo;!<br>
Propaganda like this is, the reason why Tim Wise has no need to wish for any White person under about the age of fifty to be dead, because he knows that the left already &#8216;has them&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The insidious, dirty, honourless Marxists are blatantly planting their subversive mental seeds into the minds of our children younger and younger.</p>
<p>In fact on a side bar, recently (down here in the Southern Hemisphere) I have been shopping for a school for my four year daughter.<br>
In one of the classrooms I was walking around, I was shocked to see on a wall MLK, Obama and Mandela all being displayed on some huge visual altar. I didn&rsquo;t catch the title or context of this piece, but there were no JFK&rsquo;s etc. <br>
This is in a 90%+ White town with no cultural or physical link to any of these &#8216;charactors&rsquo;.<br>
Also in our media I&rsquo;m constantly hearing the &#8220;I have a dream&hellip;(etc)&#8221;  sound byte used more and more often in our advertising and so on (often showing White people with tears of inspiration in their eyes).</p>
<p>And here is an example of a prime time television advertisement shown &#8216;down here&rsquo;.<br>

I&rsquo;m not a big TV watcher either.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to brag on this one quantification, but we probably only have about 1% of population as African descendants, although we are working on recitfying this, yet we still allow ourselves to be inflicted by the same liberal indoctrinated guilt. <br>
It reminds me of the &#8216;Red pill/blue analogy&rsquo; once you cross over and open your eyes, you see the brainwashing every where.<br>
Either that or I&rsquo;m going insane.</p>

		<p>Women who promote breast feeding in public are being very disrespectful to the people around them. If you are going to do it, then why not use a shawl to cover yourself which is what most women do anyways. This minority of women who wish to show off their breasts while doing it, obviously have other motives other than nourishing their children.</p>
<p>I am sick and tired of hearing women complain about how men degrade women.  To me it seems to be mostly women who do the degrading of other women! Why fuss at men for looking at pornography when we have goofy women who walk around saying &#8220;women should be equal to men from the waist up&#8221;, insisting that a woman&rsquo;s breasts no longer be considered private parts?  It is also women who claim &#8220;it is a woman&rsquo;s right to take her clothes off in order to celebrate her sexuality&#8221;.  How stupid is that?</p>
<p>I know I am going to get accused of going on a tangent, but believe me, all of this connects to the topic at hand.  The loud mouthed women who walk around promoting breast feeding in public are the ones who refuse to be modest about it.  Nobody is stopping you from nourishing your child; just use a shawl when you do it. Why do you need to show off your breasts in public while doing it?  Women come up with the most stupid stuff sometimes.</p>
<p>And for those of you who are going to lecture me on how America needs to get over the taboo associated with a woman&rsquo;s breasts, to that I say, &#8220;move to Europe&#8221;.  This is America, we do things differently&hellip;.sorry.  Just because you want to walk around showing your breasts while your baby sucks on them as if you are an African tribal woman, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that other civilized people want to see them as well.</p>

		<p>All this talk about breasts is getting me hot. But the photo of the little blonde girl with a black doll got me hot in a different way. I thought it was incredibly blatant, but a lefty friend I sent it to couldn&rsquo;t even understand why I&rsquo;d sent it (and she knows me)&hellip;she didn&rsquo;t even notice the color difference. Depressing.</p>

Why is it they always have to be in restaurants when others are eating and relaxing to &#8220;feed their babies&#8221;?  We also have a RIGHT not to be offended, since they always claim it is &#8220;natural&#8221; and they are offended if not allowed to show their breasts to &#8220;feed&#8221; their babies. They have alternatives and they KNOW it! Go into the restroom if you have to feed your baby, but of course they come up with some lame excuse as to why they shouldn&rsquo;t have to, don&rsquo;t they. They are agitators, period, pushing their own agenda.</p>

<p>Dude! (You couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a woman! I hope!)&hellip;would you replace sex with artificial insemination? Breast-feeding is about a lot more than just the milk&hellip;do you want your kid to bond with a bottle? That doesn&rsquo;t always work out so well in the kid&rsquo;s later years! :)</p>

Bravo bravo bravo!  Well said.  Why are women so goofy about this stuff?  </p>
<p>I am a woman, and I was raised to be modest.  These women who claim that &#8220;nourishing your baby is beautiful and natural&#8221; are the same women who have no problem videotaping themselves giving birth for the world to see. </p>
<p>Yes, a baby is a gift from God, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the processes of giving birth to it and then feeding it (revealing private areas of your body) are appropriate for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Sex is natural and &#8220;beautiful&#8221; too but I don&rsquo;t see men walking around promoting ejaculating in public.</p>
<p>Women can be really goofy, particularly feminist women.  Sometimes I am ashamed to be a part of this gender.</p>

<p>Harumphty Dumpty, you can&rsquo;t be serious. None of this justifies women being immodest when breast feeding in public.  There is no excuse for it whatsoever. Go sit in your car or in the Ladies Room.  Or do it on a public bench but use a shawl of some sort.  They even have special clothing for women to do this while not revealing anything.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fine with that&hellip;in fact, I&rsquo;ve never seen a woman nursing that didn&rsquo;t cover herself. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d care either if they didn&rsquo;t cover themselves, as long as they didn&rsquo;t do a feminist number on me if I stared appreciatively, as much at the pleasure of seeing a baby nurse as at the feminine beauty exposed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely not okay though with women feeling they have to pump their milk and carry bottles if they wish to feed their baby breast milk in public areas. I don&rsquo;t think being conservative means being unwilling to give up all habitual emotional reactions rather than accept beneficial changes. I think there are few things more important in life than a baby having the pleasure and health of getting milk directly from his mother&rsquo;s breasts. But I realize how silly that will sound to many others.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll add that I wouldn&rsquo;t take any pleasure in seeing a brown baby nursing from its white mother (the photo of the blonde girl with the brown doll made me very angry). I can&rsquo;t be 100% sure if that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve deconditioned myself from the integrationist madness I used to support, and uncovered my natural instinct, or because I&rsquo;ve just conditioned myself to a new way of feeling about it that I wouldn&rsquo;t naturally have. I&rsquo;m going to assume the former, since my present feelings feel more natural to me than my former integrationist feelings felt at the time.</p>
<p>In any case, one thing I am 100% certain of is that I&rsquo;m infuriated at the unceasing propaganda campaign that tries to ram the integrationist program further down our throats every day.</p>

<p>I am a woman and have had 5 children! You don&rsquo;t make any sense whatsoever. I have known women who take their babies in public and always take their pumped breast milk with them. Me included. Or else go to the ladies room to feed your baby. SIMPLE as that! OKAY? These women who insist of feeding their babies in restaurants and in public are just lazy or in it for the shock value, period! They have an agenda, period. Grow up and just because this is a natural thing to do does NOT mean to do it in front of strangers in public places!  Do you urinate in public? In a restaurant at your table? If not, why not? After all it is a &#8220;natural&#8221; act, is it not? </p>

		<p>Courtney, what you are saying is becoming to a maiden. Chastity and modesty become a maiden, and I salute you for advocating them.</p>
<p>But once a girl gets married, and does the sex-thing, then does the birth-thing (surrounded by male doctors!), modesty falls from her naturally like autumn leaves from trees. Actually, it is liberating and must be felt to be understood.</p>
<p>The occasional glimpse of her breast, while she feeds her baby, does not bother her in the least. Not after what she has been through, in the glorious birth process. And most men (especially the husband!) think it is the most touching, wonderful thing  &mdash;  ever! Nothing more beautiful!</p>
<p>I am sure there is a similar evolution for men, according to natural law. </p>

<p>To 47  &mdash;  Anonymous&hellip;.and threads on articles about female genital mutilation often turn to discussion of male circumcision (if I&rsquo;m around, and can make my posts polite!)</p>

		<p>la me&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about to be honest, but I appreciate the civility of your post.  What your saying is true only to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Yes, women become more comfortable around male doctors after they have gone through all these processes.  I myself being a &#8220;maiden&#8221; as you put it (I like that term) am STILL not comfortable going to male OBGYN&rsquo;s but that could change after I start having kids.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t see how this means women lose their modesty OVERALL after having babies, unless you are refering to how women become more comfortable being around each other nude in locker rooms after that age (which is something I have noticed while teenage girls are embarrassed about it).</p>
<p>When it comes to the topic of flaunting your private parts for the world to see, I hardly know any grown women who are comfortable with that idea at all.  My mom isn&rsquo;t as modest as I am with male doctors, but she is just as modest as I am if not more so around male strangers.  Growing up she always nursed my younger sibling in private and just about all of her friends did the same unless they were only around female company.</p>
<p>And are you also saying that after a woman gives birth she doesn&rsquo;t care who sees her vagina?  That is absurd!  I know many women who have had babies, and yes while they are comfortable with all the doctors in the room, they tend to be very strict about who else is allowed in the room.  And they most certainly don&rsquo;t videotape it and then show it at a church picnic.</p>
<p>The women you speak of are indeed a small minority (West Coast and liberated).</p>

		<p>The only thing this breastfeeding issue involves is that most people now refuse to change one iota of their lifestyle, even for a few  minutes, to raise their children. Breastfeeding in public is 3/4 laziness (it&rsquo;s so much easier just sitting there whipping it out than to get up and remove oneself from the action, and you don&rsquo;t miss any of the fun going on around you), and 1/4 defiance. No one is willing to sacrifice even the tiniest part of their own life to raise well-balanced children. It used to be that when people became parents they changed their life to focus on the children first. Now, children are just an add-on.</p>
<p>But the ad is still despicible.</p>

		<p>Dear Courtney, the women I am speaking of are not on the West coast, nor are they &#8220;liberated.&#8221; They are in the South, like I am.</p>
<p>Here, it is nothing to see women nursing their babies in church or anywhere else. If the baby makes a sudden move, or if the mother puts the baby down, and the mother is exposed, it is no big deal.</p>
<p>This is not &#8220;African.&#8221; It is European, and was the practice of our European forbears. </p>
<p>I suppose what I am advocating is &#8220;no shame.&#8221; Modesty, yes, but not shame. Shame is a deadly psychological poison that makes you hate some aspect of your being. And of course I am not advocating the kind of total full-body exposure to the opposite sex that you amusedly  mention; but it has happened to me before and I reacted with modesty and grace, but not shame. Each incident was forgotten about five minutes later; and it had no meaning.  <br>
 <br>
Which brings me back to the adorable French child, made to pose with the black plastic baby: We don&rsquo;t want to be like the Muslims, blacks, or anybody else from that region of the world. They seem to go berserk about such things as seeing a breast or a buttock. Let us value our European men  &mdash;  they are kindler and gentler, so much so! We do not want the kind of gene that the Muslim men seem to possess to be in our European genepool. </p>
<p>Nor do we want to be forced to wear the burkhas that seem to be necessary to avert the sexual madness that possesses these men.</p>
<p>No, let us praise our men to the skies! There is no finer species of men, none wiser, none braver, none harder working, and none that love better! and I have one of the best! </p>

		<p>la me&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I am not going to spend much more time going off on this tangent.  But in regards to the following that you said&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, it is nothing to see women nursing their babies in church or anywhere else. If the baby makes a sudden move, or if the mother puts the baby down, and the mother is exposed, it is no big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ummmm.  I am from the South too, and I have yet to see a woman expose her breast down here in public like you suggest, unless we are talking about Bourbon Street in New Orleans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what &#8220;South&#8221; you are speaking of, but it is not the South I know.</p>
<p>John PM who posts on here, and I are good friends.  We became good friends after enjoying each others&rsquo; posts on this website for years. We talk on the phone now.  He is from the Midwest.  He tells me that this lifestyle you speak of is something that he himself has NEVER witnessed first hand, except with an African American woman on one unfortunate occasion when he was sitting across from her in the waiting room at a hospital.  He and I just discussed this on the phone last night.</p>
<p>I am from the South and I have never seen this lifestyle you speak of.  John PM is from the Midwest and he has never seen it either. </p>
<p>I have never gone to church or anywhere else in the South not knowing whether or not I am going to see a woman&rsquo;s nipple in a public setting.  I am pretty certain each time that I WILL NOT see it, because I never do.</p>
<p>You celebrate this as a &#8220;European thing&#8221;.  I look at it as uncivilized.  We aren&rsquo;t animals and we aren&rsquo;t tribal women in New Guinea or Africa.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what honoring our men has to do with this.  I honor white men every day.  I think they are amazing.  I would never go out with or have any sort of relationship with any other race of men.  I don&rsquo;t see what any of this has to do with a woman being modest.  Nor am I advocating burka wearing.</p>
<p>It is when I read posts like yours&rsquo; that I come to the conclusion of how naive women can be. If you are an attractive woman and you expose your nipple in church, do you really think men are thinking &#8220;oh how beautiful&hellip;she is nursing her baby&#8221;??????  No, what they are doing is seeing it as an opportunity to look at your breasts!!!  Look at Harumphty Dumphty&rsquo;s posts above! He is a man, and I was going to try to avoid saying this, but his posts so far have hinted a slight amount of perversion in regards to this topic and why he wants to advocate breast feeding in public.  </p>
<p>All of this aside, I can&rsquo;t think of any man in a Southern Baptist congregation being okay with his wife breastfeeding in church in an immodest fashion.</p>
<p>Women sure can be dumb sometimes&hellip;.I swear!</p>
<p>After reading what you write, la me&rsquo;re, it is obvious to me that you are a liberated woman and you don&rsquo;t speak for most women in the South. The style   of language and wording you use, to me sounds very hippy and West Coast.  You speak of a lifestyle that I don&rsquo;t want to be apart of. And I am curious as to what you mean when you mention men walking in on you in the nude and you not caring 5 minutes later. You sound to me like you are in a minority group of women on that note.</p>
<p>This is America.  In America women cover their breasts on beaches. This isn&rsquo;t Europe.  Stop trying to promote an agenda. Either breasts are a private area or they aren&rsquo;t.  In America they are considered private, so why do women like you suddenly think they are NOT private just because you are nursing?????? Men are going to look for perverted reasons whether you are flashing them during Mardi Gras or innocently nursing your child.  That is something you need to learn to accept.</p>
<p>Women like you are exhibitionists and you enjoy the attention of showing off your body. Guess what?  I don&rsquo;t care what your lifestyle is, but I don&rsquo;t want my boyfriend or husband seeing YOUR nipple in public!  He is only supposed to see mine!  Women like you don&rsquo;t care about nourishing your child.  You can nourish your child and still be modest about it.  Women like you just want to draw attention to yourselves in an inappropriate manner, and you have no right to do that!</p>
<p>In regards to the poster, why are they using a child so young to pose such an act anyways?  I am mostly concerned about the fact that they are using a young girl for this, but the color of the baby is pretty bad too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at Harumphty Dumphty&rsquo;s posts above! He is a man, and I was going to try to avoid saying this, but his posts so far have hinted a slight amount of perversion in regards to this topic&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, hey, Courtney, no fair referring to submissions you possibly read but which weren&rsquo;t posted!</p>
<p>Yes, I think breast-feeding is in part &#8220;sexy,&#8221; or at least sexual (as is birth, as experienced by many women who have had home births), as well as lovely in many other respects. Every race and culture has its faults, and IMO the anti-body strain of Puritan feeling that runs so deeply in our culture is one of our faults. And is really what most of the discomfort about breast feeding is all about.</p>
<p>Hispanic culture that hasn&rsquo;t degenerated is just as moral as our own, but is much more naturally enjoying of body pleasures. Living with a family in Mexico, I declined an ice cream one day, and the very Christian (non-Catholic) lady I was with said, &#8220;Señor, God wants us to enjoy ourselves.&#8221; A sentiment that seemed very odd to me, having been raised in traditional U.S. Christianity.</p>
<p>I admit a personal preference for the Hispanic attitude, but I don&rsquo;t draw firm conclusions about it, and I&rsquo;d be the last one to want to tamper too much with anything so intrinsic as a culture&rsquo;s attitude about sex, since the ramifications are so numerous and unknown.</p>
<p>But when it comes to a baby&rsquo;s need to nurse from its mother, I draw the line.</p>
<p>And a white person who comes to believe that everything they feel in their gut is correct just because they are white is on the wrong track.</p>

<p>Hm, I may have gotten a bit carried away there&hellip;I momentarily forgot how endemic wife beating is to Mexican culture, as is the pursuit of other women by married men. </p>

		<p>Harumphty Dumpty,</p>
<p>There were two sentences above inparticular that sounded a little perverted to me, and you reitterate it in the post you just wrote.  What do you mean when you say &#8220;breast feeding is sexy&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is easy for men to say they want women to breast feed in public when they want to see women&rsquo;s breasts. What if men wanted to show their penises in public?  How would you, as a man, feel about that?</p>
<p>As for America&rsquo;s Puritan origins, well, sorry but that is what we are. This minority of people (and it is a minority) who wish to force this agenda need to accept that America is more prudish than other countries. Instead of trying to change us, why don&rsquo;t you move to Latin America or Europe?</p>
<p>I did a lot of reading on this topic yesterday, and whether you like it or not, most American women choose to be modest when they breast feed in public.  If men like you who want a peep show and liberated exhibitionist women have a problem with it, then you can move elsewhere.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect me and many other women to just wake up tomorrow feeling okay with you sitting next to us on a park bench catching glimpses of our breasts.</p>

<p>Courtney, this is not far from the way women dress in public today, if you step back and get some perspective on our conversation.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little ironic that we&rsquo;re fussing about breastfeeding in public (and we really are in agreement that it&rsquo;s best done modestly&hellip;you&rsquo;re just more insistent on that aspect than I am)&hellip;it&rsquo;s ironic, since women now routinely walk around in public dressed in a manner that would have been considered scandalous in the bedroom in 1950. Societies that think nothing of public breastfeeding would probably blanch at the manner in which our women now dress.</p>
<p>And that current manner of women&rsquo;s dress is something I don&rsquo;t like&hellip;it&rsquo;s a constant titillation&hellip;it&rsquo;s a perfect representation of much of our sexuality, too often focused on surface titillation, multiple partners, etc. etc. and not grounded in the deeper flows of ecstatic feeling and loving attachment that humans and many other animals are capable of.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m heterosexual, the question (I&rsquo;m going to treat it as a real one, to hopefully make a point) of a mode of dress being adopted in which men&rsquo;s penises were exposed is only of mild interest to me. Men are curious about how their own &#8220;measures up&#8221; to others, so I would probably just find such exposure to be of mild interest, much as I notice other features of men&rsquo;s bodies presently. I think it would be for women to say whether or not they would welcome such a mode of dress, just as I feel I have grounds to complain of the immodest mode of women&rsquo;s dress today.</p>
<p>If my remarks seem contradictory, I&rsquo;m sorry. Of course as much as women&rsquo;s dress today bothers me, I also enjoy it at the same time.</p>
<p>I guess what I really don&rsquo;t like is heavy-handed moralism about body stuff. About marriage, fidelity, honorable behavior&hellip;Yes!! But let&rsquo;s enjoy our bodies and make use of them as they evolved to be enjoyed and made use of.</p>

		<p>Courtney, methinks you reacted a mite too harshly! I was disappointed in your brittle tone, your lack of respect. </p>
<p>No, I am not a &#8220;liberated&#8221; woman  &mdash;  I am a born-again Christian. Not any where near New Orleans. And breast-feeding is not sexual like Mardi-Gras flashing is. Don&rsquo;t confuse them.</p>
<p>Dear Courtney, how do you presume to speak for so many men? How do you know what is in their hearts? Do you not think that they would view the female figure with sympathy, honor, and awe? White men are not Muslims, who react to the very idea of an undressed woman with frenzy.</p>
<p>As far as the baby being put down while the mother is breast-feeding, our female assistant pastor did exactly that once in front of the entire congregation, and no one batted an eye.</p>
<p>Courtney, I say this with love for you, but what we are dealing with here are issues of shame and immaturity.</p>
<p>You said you talked with John Pm on the phone; perhaps we could also talk?  You sound very young, and I think I have a few years on you, but we could benefit from a dialogue! </p>
<p>With love and respect,</p>

		<p>la me&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>This is a topic I feel strongly about, and you are being just as rude as I am to some degree. Maybe I overreacted before, but I just don&rsquo;t know how to go about this topic differently. You talk about what goes on in your church as if it is normal, but to me and others, it seems to be odd. The fact that you have female assistant pastors is odd enough in the South to begin with. Is it a Baptist church?</p>
<p>And it sounds to me like your church promotes immodest breastfeeding; either that or you are exaggerating what you are telling me. Either way, your story doesn&rsquo;t hold water for me.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to call me up and discuss anything with me, no matter how good your intentions.  I am not going to be convinced by any woman that it is okay to show my nipple in public and that it is okay for my husband or boyfriend to see another woman&rsquo;s nipple in public.</p>
<p>I read up on this topic the other day.  The overall consensus seems to be that most American women are MODEST when they breastfeed in public.  They don&rsquo;t let their boob flop out for all to see.  As far as men go, they tend to either be disgusted by it or interested for perverted reasons.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you asked me if I speak for all men.  Do YOU speak for all men?</p>
<p>I am glad you are a born again Christian.  I am too. I wish you the best, but this is a topic I just don&rsquo;t agree with you on.</p>

<p>Of course I don&rsquo;t speak for all men  &mdash;  only those I know.</p>
<p>And they think nothing of seeing a woman&rsquo;s breast while she is feeding her baby. I already told you that! How many times &hellip;?</p>
<p>They are NOT disgusted by it. Look at their faces when they observe it  &mdash;  there are only tender feelings, feeling of wonder and awe. They are observing the continuance of the White race! What other feelings could they have?</p>
<p>Really, it is no big deal. Nor is a woman&rsquo;s breast some kind of ancient god in some holy-of-holies, where you will fall dead if you see his visage.</p>
<p>Courtney, your words seem to sizzle with shame. Shame is a devouring fire that will destroy some aspect of yourself, if it is not contained. As I said before: Modesty, yes; shame, no. Do not allow yourself to be twisted by shame about the body that God gave you. Throw away that Puritan shame  &mdash;  and Thanksgiving is a perfect time to do so!</p>
<p>Let me repeat: I am for modesty, but not shame. There is a big difference. And let me go further: I am for chastity, always have been, according to the scriptures and the teachings of the Church.   </p>
<p>Courtney, nudity of any sort is not sex.</p>
<p>And back to the topic: White people will survive! Sex among Whites produces White people; therefore it is holy! It is best, and wonderful beyond imagination, when reserved for marriage, with your one and only, and blessed by the Church! Breast-feeding nourishes those White infants and improves their IQ&rsquo;s. Therefore, breast-feeding is holy! NOT SHAMEFUL, Courtney. A woman&rsquo;s breast is pure, not corrupt. To see it, is to be given a vision of the wellsprings of life. </p>
<p>To shame any of the above, or attempt to shame them, as you seem to be inclined to do, is to spray ice-cold water on  the idea of White continuance. </p>
<p>Courtney, if it was up to me, I would have idealized statues of nude White people, men and women, everywhere I could put them.<br>
We need to adore our White bodies, praise them, see them as they could be &hellip; not heap shame upon them. To despise them is a trick of the Enemy. </p>
<p>Please &hellip; let&rsquo;s talk.  I have important things to tell you.</p>

		<p>I an not a born-again Christian (nor even religious), but am very impressed, and amazed, at the warmth, kindness, and wisdom of La Mere. She is obviously a wonderful woman and a blessing to all those around her.  How lucky a man her husband must be to have such a companion and  mother for his children.  Bless you, LaMere!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for all others here.<br>

		<p>La me&rsquo;re, we can keep going back and forth on this issue. Nobody in my camp is trying to stop women from breastfeeding and I am tired of women like you trying to misconstrue our arguments as such. All we are saying is be modest about it. Most American white women do this every day; breastfeed their young in public with special clothing on that prevents immodesty or using a shawl to drape over their shoulder or *gasp* going into a dressing room or sitting in the car to do so.  Why is this so hard to understand?</p>

<p>Courtney, if there was misconstrual, it occurred on your side also. My post #41 was only in defense of breast-feeding vs. being fed mother&rsquo;s milk from a bottle, but you responded as if I&rsquo;d supported immodesty.</p>
<p>The fact is, a woman sitting on a bench breast-feeding in public is on the average more modestly covered than are the women walking by!</p>

		<p>Personally, I couldn&rsquo;t care less. Breastfeeding doesn&rsquo;t faze me at all. It&rsquo;s just anatomy. Big deal!  Frankly, I could get a bigger thrill walking past the meat counter in the supermarket. <br>
  <br>
So can we stop all this wrangling and get back to the poster?</p>

<p>How old is the girl in this advertisement, seven??  </p>
<p>This poster - and specifically the portrayal of the very young girl in it - is inappropriate and of bad taste!  Would you want your young daughter being portrayed in this manner?  The people responsible for this poster should be horse-whipped!</p>
<p>Oh well, not only do we have to convince our daughters that colour doesn&rsquo;t matter; but we have to brainwash them with the propaganda as soon as we can.</p>
<p>I want to know how the girl in this poster will feel about her portrayal a decade or two from now.  Will she be proud of herself?</p>
<p>I guess the increasing number of Black Africans in France still couldn&rsquo;t possibly provide one young black woman who could&rsquo;ve sufficed for the purpose of this poster.  It just had to be a little blonde-haired white girl, didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>This child needs to be schooled about reality&hellip;.and fast!!<br>
