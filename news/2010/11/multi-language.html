<h1>Multi-Language Posters Aimed at Combating Teen Prostitution</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Sullivan, Seattle Times, Nov. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A statewide effort to combat human trafficking got a push Tuesday as political leaders, police and representatives from social-welfare groups unveiled a poster created to persuade victims to call for help.</p>
<p>The dark-colored posters, featuring images of a young woman sitting on a bed, a boy working in a field, a woman working in the hotel industry and a man working behind a sewing machine, were on display in state Attorney General Rob McKenna&rsquo;s downtown Seattle office.</p>
<p>The text on the posters reads, &#8220;No one should force you into work or prostitution,&#8221; and is in multiple languages. The posters list a toll-free number for people to call.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies recovered 23 teenage prostitutes in the Everett-Seattle-Tacoma area as part of a national sweep. In all, 69 children were rescued in 40 cities across the country as part of &#8220;Operation Cross Country V.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Washington state is leading the country in the fight against human trafficking,&#8221; McKenna said Tuesday. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the fastest growing criminal industry in the world, second only to narcotics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lai said he&rsquo;s hopeful the posters will give victims of human trafficking assurance that the people are concerned about their safety. Many victims, he said, are &#8220;skeptical about coming forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The posters, which have been translated into Russian, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and English, soon will be plastered onto light poles and inside churches, community centers and other gathering places.</p>
<p>Proponents hope to have fliers placed on billboards and bus shelters, said Lacie Morrison, executive director of Seattle Against Slavery, a grass-roots coalition whose goal is &#8220;to make a slave-free world.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Many victims, he said, are &ldquo;skeptical about coming forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I notice the article doesn&rsquo;t mention WHY.  Because, much like narcotics trafficking, there are big guys and little guys in the money stream involved.</p>
<p>And in the case of human slavery, especially prostitution, ESPECIALLY prostitution of children, the BIG guys are in the government.  They are also of a specific racial background&hellip;&hellip;in every country of the world, including ours.  The modern history of this goes back to before World War I and used to be a much documented, highly controversial issue that was a big part of World War II and the decisions made after that war.  Much less well documented is the near 2000 year ancient history of this issue.  There used to be books written about that.  Outside the Nation of Islam, no modern book has been written on this for two generations.  At least in english.</p>
<p>Today, although nothing has changed, except perhaps the level of tolerance in the US, of this, as &#8220;normal&#8221; or at least so big that not much can be done about it, there is almost no discussion as to who runs this industry at the top and why all of them are of the same race.</p>

<p>I have a little bit of indirect experience with this issue:</p>

<p>Interestingly, part of Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070 has enhanced punishment for illegal aliens trafficking underage girls for the sake of prostitution.  I wonder what most people in this Washington State effort against human trafficking thinks about that.</p>

		<p>I was in Seattle yesterday.  I did not see anyone who seemed to be a prostitute, but what I did see was interesting.  I had business at a shop near the Space Needle, just to give a general idea of where I was.  I did notice a black male here and there, walking alone on the streets.  They gave me the feeling that they were not heading anywhere in a hurry.  There weren&rsquo;t too many people on the street and traffic was light.  I assumed most people were in offices at work, as it was mid morming.  I did see a number of women, young women, but they all seemed on their way somewhere.  They tend to dress in skin tight jeans, short boots and medium jakcets.  They walked with purpose.  Two I saw walking together were in deep converstaion that the feeling I got was that it was a conversation kept up for the purposes of defense.  But the most interesting thing I saw was one young, quite attractive woman, a blonde, who passed me by with a brisk walk. You could have seen Lincoln on a penny in her back pocket.  She walked past me, looking straight ahead.  I&rsquo;ve been nodded to by prostitutes in SF, so I knew that she was not looking for business.  When she got to a corner, waiting for a light, a black man walked up beside her and looked her up and down.  When the light changed she sprinted up the street for about 10 yards.  I could only think that this too, was a defense.  My impression is that young women in Seattle know the score, and dont&rsquo; want to be hit on when they are on the streets. Good luck to them. </p>

		<p>Notice the non-judgmental, non-moral but libertarian motif in the message: &#8220;No one should be forced (sic) to work as a prostitute.&#8221;  The implication is, of course, that prostitution would otherwise be acceptable, as long as it were simply an economic transaction between two free actors.</p>

		<p>Note well that the only prostitute in the poster is a blond white woman.</p>

		<p>Child slavery doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been as big a problem during the &#8220;Father Knows Best/Leave it to Beaver&#8221; era in America that Tim Wise hates so much.</p>
<p>I wonder why that was the case.</p>
