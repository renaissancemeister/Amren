<h1>In India, Cellphones Abound, Toilets Don&rsquo;t</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ravi Nessman, Seattle Times, October 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Mumbai slum of Rafiq Nagar has no clean water for its shacks made of ripped tarp and bamboo. No garbage pickup. No power except from haphazard cables strung overhead illegally.</p>
<p>And not a single toilet or latrine for its 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Yet nearly every destitute family in the slum has a cellphone. Some have three.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is a country buoyed by a vibrant business world of call centers and software developers, but hamstrung by a bloated, corrupt government that has failed to deliver the barest of services.</p>
<p>Its estimated growth rate of 8.5 percent a year is among the highest in the world, but its roads are crumbling.</p>
<p>It offers cheap, world-class medical care to Western tourists at private hospitals, yet has some of the worst child-mortality and maternal death rates outside sub-Saharan Africa. {snip}</p>
<p>The cellphone frenzy bridges all worlds. Cellphones are sold amid the Calvin Klein and Clinique stores in India&rsquo;s new malls and in the crowded markets of its working-class neighborhoods. {snip}</p>
<p>The Beecham&rsquo;s cellphone dealer in New Delhi&rsquo;s Connaught Place is overrun with lunchtime customers of all classes looking for everything from a $790 Blackberry Torch to a basic $26 Nokia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were more than 670 million cellphone connections in India by the end of August, a number that has been growing by nearly 20 million a month, according to government figures. Yet U.N. figures show that only 366 million Indians have access to a private toilet or latrine.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least tap water and sewage disposal; how can we talk about any development without these two fundamental things?&#8221; says Anita Patil-Deshmukhl, executive director of PUKAR, an organization that conducts research and outreach in the slums of Mumbai.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an economist credited with unleashing India&rsquo;s private sector by loosening government regulation, talks about growth that benefits the masses of poor people and a burgeoning middle class of about 300 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Private companies have tried to fill that gap, and Tata sells a $16 water purifier for the poor. Mafias provide water and electricity to slumdwellers at a cost far higher than what wealthy Indians pay for basic services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Annabhau Sathe Nagar, a raised latrine of corrugated tin empties into a river of sewage that children splash in and adults wade across. The slum in east Mumbai has about 50,000 residents and a single toilet building, with 10 pay toilets for men and eight for women, two of which are broken.</p>
<p>With the wait for those toilets up to an hour even at 5 a.m., and the 4-cent fee too expensive for many, most people either use a field or use toilets at work, says Santosh Thorat, 32, a community organizer.<br>

		<p>Interesting that this comes up today.  I was at my doctor&rsquo;s this morning and on the wall was a map of the world.  The countries of the world were colored according to risk of diarrhea: red = low, yellow = medium, orange = high, brown = very high.  The US, UK, EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were all low.  Argentina, Chile, Japan, South Africa, and Russia were medium risk.  I was surprised that Japan ranked as low as second-tier and that SA ranked as high!  Most of the rest were orange.  Only India and one SE Asian country (I am not sure which, the map had no names and I was sitting across the room) were colored brown.  What made me chuckle at the time was that highly vaunted India not only ranked much lower than Communist China, which also has 1.5 billion people in a similar size nation, but lower than the Congo!  Only the advanced white-run countries were safe.  If the Indians were so smart, as we are told, why don&rsquo;t they work at cleaning up their own country?  Even the Africans try to avoid large numbers of dead bodies laying about.</p>
<p>By any and all objective measures whites have created the safest, most desirable countries on earth.  Oh how our progency will curse us for allowing them to be ruled by their social and scientific inferiors.</p>

		<p>What people don&rsquo;t seem to understabnd about India and also China is that these countries are booming because of one thing and one thing only. The western (read white) world has been shipping their wealth there in huge numbers. These countries offer one thing only - Cheap labour.</p>
<p>If the west got some strong leaders and looked after their own people these countries would return to what they&rsquo;ve been doing for hundreds of years. Nothing.</p>

		<p>This is a bizarre misplacement of priorities not unlike that exhibited by Africans. </p>
<p>In &#8220;Penn &amp; Teller&rsquo;s Magic and Mystery Tour,&#8221; in which the duo travel to India, one thing that can&rsquo;t escape notice (or the camera) is the flies. They are everywhere. In the streets, in the homes, and in front of the interviewer&rsquo;s faces at all times. The lack of proper sanitation might explain this. </p>
<p>We read about a &#8220;bloated, corrupt government&#8221; which we were led to believe from movies like &#8220;Ghandi&#8221; described only the British rulers. And of course the population continues to skyrocket out of all proportion. </p>
<p>So what are we to make of this disaster so many decades after the end of British rule?  This article describes to me a somewhat childlike and irrational people who are barely able to keep a civilization going outside of white influence.</p>

		<p>I remember the H1-B Indians where I used to work.  They slept in shifts in tiny rented apartments and then washed in a sink and shat at the office.  It was an ordeal to relieve oneself of one&rsquo;s morning coffee, shall we say, due to the stench in the men&rsquo;s room.</p>

		<p>&#8220;4-cent fee too expensive for many&#8221;<br>
But surely, the $26 spent on the cheapest phone cited in the article, would have been enough for them to go to the toilet for a couple of months?</p>
<p>The Indian Government has managed great growth by simply cutting back on the bureaucracy that held back entrepeneurial spirit in its upper class. To get further, they must unlock the potential in those of lower social status by providing basic social infrastructure (investing in sewers for a start). Also I believe that some control of the rural city flow is needed across the nation.<br>
Back when the developed world industrialised, the process was slower and the cities were able to absorb population from rural areas more easily, now the flow is rapid and can create massive slums. They should at least have a look at what China does to solve the problem of slums; they seem at least slightly more successful in keeping conditions relatively sanitary for their people: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system</a><br>
It&rsquo;s a tried and tested method (de fact apartheid it might be)</p>
<p>Finally they&rsquo;ve got their priorities all wrong. If I were in a slum, I would try and hoard food to prvent hunger and then amass enough capital to move out (though of course the latter is a lot harder than it seems).</p>

		<p>@6  Your statemet is innacurate because India was doing quite well as a civilisation before European colonialism. Ever heard of the Indus civilisation?</p>
<p>Your other point is also redundant. India and the other emerging countries no longer need the west. Get a Tea party protectionist to replace Obama as President and nothing will change except the USA will collapse at a faster rate. The emerging countries are now trading with EACH OTHER. Emerging economy growth is due to <b>home demand<b> and <b>intra-emerging economy<b> trade. Brazil trades with Nigeria. India trades with ASEAN etc etc. </b></b></b></b></p>
<p>Get it now?</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I once had a book about India (unfortunately now lost) written well before our mental and cultural transformations of the 60&rsquo;s, back  when imperialism was not considered  evil and the British were not yet made ashamed of their empire. </p>
<p>It stated, as best I remember, that the British colonial administration in India was in fact extremely trim and efficient  - hardly &#8220;bloated&#8221;! - and that Britain managed to govern vast India with only about 15,000 colonial administrators.</p>
<p>The number of Englishmen (well, British) in India was never large. Unlike in America, they never established colonies of their own people or displaced the natives. They had no wish to do so. Aside from establishing hospitals, schools, railways, sanitation, and outlawing certain barbaric practices such as suttee, they pretty much left the natives alone and did not interfere with the natives&rsquo; culture, customs, or religion.</p>

		<p>Realist, seeing as how the majority of Tea Partiers are trade protectionists, that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s coming down the pike. Since India is doing so well they won&rsquo;t mind if we bring those jobs back to America.  Their customer service call centers are horrible anyhow and I would much rather speak to an American than someone with a muddled and difficult to understand accent and a fake name like Mary or Jeannette.  </p>

		<p>In the early 90&rsquo;s I was in the Dominican Republic and visited some of the &#8220;bateyes.&#8221; The &#8220;bateyes&#8221; are where the sugar ane workers lived. They weren&rsquo;t villages, as there were no churches or stores, they were just little settlements where people lived. There were no toilets, people just did their thing in the nearby fields. There was no running water except for one little spigot which served everybody. However, electricity was provided by the government so they all had TV&rsquo;s and most of thwen had cell phones. (At the time even I didn&rsquo;t have a cell phone.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a totally different mentality. The government official I was with pointed out port-o-sans by the side of the road that thy were trying to provide to the people, but the people would steal them at night for the parts. A very nice young girl I met from one of the &#8220;bateyes&#8221; invited me back in a few months for their annual ceremony in which they sacrificed a bull. I declined her invataion.</p>
<p>As I say, it&rsquo;s a different mentality.     </p>

<p>I first visited Puerto Rico in 1960, and parts of San Juan were like that. Rural areas were even worse.  Kids were swimming in filthy canals filled with sewage and garbage. They were blissfully unconcerned. I still have the pictures.  That is all changed now, just a memory. But the DR, by contrast, was far behind PR. Even the tap water in the hotel was taken right from the ocean and could not be drunk. (PS. I still have no cell phone, and wouldn&rsquo;t want one!)</p>

<p>You are truly funny. The Indians were incapable of even building one single metre of additional rail track for fifty years after the british left. They thought the idea was just to pile more and more people into the carriages and then onto the roof.It took anotehr white company to come in and do it then.</p>

		<p>India has an inflation rate nearing 10%.<br>
It also has big trade and fiscal deficits.<br>
Traditionally these are always leading indicators that &#8216;emerging&rsquo; economies are heading very soon for a crash - this happened before around 1990, when a previous &#8216;Indian miracle&rsquo; crashed.<br>
  It is a big mistake (although perpetrated by many supposed &#8216;experts&rsquo;) to conflate India with China.<br>
It&rsquo;s rather like comparing a Rolls-Royce with a Yugo hatchback.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t see how India is regarded as an emerging economic power when it has a population living in abject poverty equal to the entire population of the USA. I agree with posters who say that India provides cheap sources of labor, and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the demography and geography of India and China. China has about 1.5 billion people, and India has around 1.2 billion people. Now, compare the land area of China and India. Given that India is so much smaller than China, where in blazes are they going to put India&rsquo;s burgeoning population, some 300 million less than China&rsquo;s; given the rate of India&rsquo;s population growth? How is India (or any 3rd World country, for that matter) expected to &#8220;go green&#8221;?</p>
<p>India has never been a model of political stability, a force in education or a maritime power. I can see another war breaking out between India and Pakistan within the next 5 or 10 years. It will be another nail in the coffin for diversity and multiculturalism.</p>

     India was doing quite well economically before the 1800&rsquo;s<br>
     AD.  It is true.   According to the economist Angus Madison<br>
     from the year 1 AD to 1500&rsquo;s AD, the combined Indian <br>
     economy was the  largest in the world, around 30% of <br>
     what was then world trade.  From 1500&rsquo;s AD-1700 AD, Indian <br>
     economy was second, after China but ahead of Western and <br>
     Eastern Europe.  Temporarily, in 1700 AD, Indian economy <br>
     became number one before it went back to second place upto<br>
     1800 AD.  </p>

     There was no Aryan invasion.  No archaeological proof for <br>
     it.  Many archaeologists dont believe there ever was any <br>
     Aryan invasion/migration to India.    </p>
<p>     The Greeks were present largely in Iran, Afghanistan and<br>
     western parts of Pakistan, not really India.   </p>
<p>     The Hindu Kingdoms fought the Muslim invaders for couple <br>
     of centuries until a major Hindu power, the Marathas <br>
     defeated the the Mughals.  Much of India was always under <br>
     Hindu rulers/kingdoms even in the Medieval period.    </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>That is interesting. Thank you.</p>
<p>But obviously something was missing.<br>
Otherwise, how was tiny Portugal able to go there - half way around the world - establish colonies and take control of most of their trade?  Followed soon after by tiny Holland! Two of the smallest countries of Europe.</p>
<p>I agree that Europeans sought tropical products which they could not grow at home [eg. spices, necessary for food preservation before canning and refrigeration].  But if India controlled 30% of world trade, Indians did not go to Europe,  it was the other way around.<br>
Why?</p>

		<p>Historians (many of them nonwhite themselves) who love to remind us of how &#8220;the Middle East, India, and China&#8221; were so far ahead of Europe before 1500 AD are giving misguided accounts of history for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>I love how Indians and their sympathizers in the West enjoy molding bits and pieces of history the way it suits them. By listening to them you would think white people got to the top by murder and greed and nothing else.  And then they go on to remind us about how Indians from Ancient times to the present were always number one in science and the subjects that mattered, while at the same time always being the civilized victims of white barbarian invaders (including the British).</p>
<p>Well, my friend, you can&rsquo;t have it both ways. You can&rsquo;t complain about being the victim of white invaders while at the same time claiming to be superior and more intelligent than whites.  It doesn&rsquo;t work both ways.  You have to pick one or the other and stick with it.</p>
<p>We can go on and on claiming that India and China were superior to the West up until a certain point when the criteria we are going by that defines &#8220;superior&#8221; is very particular in order to reach that conclusion.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the West has ALWAYS been superior in the field of science going all the way back to Ancient Greece.  The Chinese experimented with technology early on, but without science they could only get so far.  Indians and Middle Easterners made some achievements with math but only got so far without some important European contributions to math as well as the Scientific Method.  </p>
<p>And, just like the Chinese, most of their pursuits were strictly for the purpose of meeting ritualistic needs, while Europeans made their pursuits strictly for the purpose of looking into science in itself. And how many of these Middle Eastern and Indian math geniuses were actually more or less white?</p>

<p>Amazing the things one finds these days on a doctor&rsquo;s office walls!</p>
