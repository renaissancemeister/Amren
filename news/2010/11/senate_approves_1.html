<h1>Senate Approves $4.6B for Black Farmers, Indians</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Clare Jalonick, Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Senate has approved almost $4.6 billion to settle long-standing claims brought by American Indians and black farmers against the government. </p>
<p>The money has been held up for months in the Senate as Democrats and Republicans squabbled over how to pay for it. The two class action lawsuits were filed over a decade ago. </p>
<p>The settlements include almost $1.2 billion for black farmers who say they suffered discrimination at the hands of the Agriculture Department. Also, $3.4 billion would go to Indian landowners who claim they were swindled out of royalties by the Interior Department. The legislation was approved in the Senate by voice vote Friday and sent to the House. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawmakers from both parties have said they support resolving the long-standing claims of discrimination and mistreatment by federal agencies. But the funding has been caught up in a fight over spending and deficits. Republicans repeatedly objected to the settlements when they were added on to larger pieces of legislation. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., satisfied conservative complaints by finding spending offsets to cover the cost. </p>
<p>The legislation also includes a one-year extension of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which gives grants to states to provide cash assistance and other services to the poor, and several American Indian water rights settlements in Arizona, Montana and New Mexico sought by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. </p>
<p>In the Indian case, at least 300,000 Native Americans claim they were swindled out of royalties overseen by the Interior Department since 1887 for things like oil, gas, grazing and timber. The plaintiffs would share the settlement. </p>
<p>The Cobell lawsuit has dragged on for almost 15 years, with one judge in 2008 comparing it to the Charles Dickens&rsquo; &#8220;Bleak House,&#8221; which chronicles a never-ending legal suit. Using passages from that novel, U.S. District Judge James Robertson noted that the &#8220;suit has, in course of time, become so complicated&#8221; that &#8220;no two lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the black farmers, it is the second round of funding from a class-action lawsuit originally settled in 1999 over allegations of widespread discrimination by local Agriculture Department offices in awarding loans and other aid. It is known as the Pigford case, named after Timothy Pigford, a black farmer from North Carolina who was an original plaintiff. </p>
<p>The government already has paid out more than $1 billion to about 16,000 farmers, with most getting payments of about $50,000. The new money is intended for people  &mdash;  some estimates say 70,000 or 80,000  &mdash;  who were denied earlier payments because they missed deadlines for filing. The amount of money each would get depends on how many claims are successfully filed. </p>
<p>The bill passed Friday would be partially paid for by diverting dollars from a surplus in nutrition programs for women and children and by extending customs user fees. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said passage &#8220;marks a major milestone in USDA&rsquo;s efforts to turn the page on a sad chapter in our history.&#8221; <br/>

<p>How the public can clean out a good portion of leftist vipers from the House yet election after election not do the same for these leftist dregs in the Senate, the one chamber that has been the cause for so much anti-white, anti-Americanism all these years, tells me that the voters are too dense to really understand the situation.</p>
<p>We deserve to fall.  We NEED a large white self-sufficient community enclave that is a sovereign entity with only &#8220;AWARE&#8221; whites.  The do-gooders, the radicals and the rest can live among the non-white hordes.</p>

<p>That is so wrong.  I&rsquo;m so tired of constant black scams, whether rich or poor, they all seem to be scamming and laughing about gettin over on the stupid whites&hellip;<br/>
and I&rsquo;m not sorry if that is stereotyping&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve lived a long time and that is my experience, outside of about .000043% of blacks have a trace of goodness in them, hidden somewhere.<br/>
maybe it is the white part of them.  <br/>
and to smooth the circle, sometimes whites don&rsquo;t seem much better.  but at least, most whites aren&rsquo;t predjudiced about it&hellip;.. they&rsquo;ll steal from whom ever</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just reparations, flying out from the Obama/Chavezistas at light speed, via every channel open to them. This is  just one handy spigot. The government electronic debit cards are the real scandal. No need to print money, just keep topping off those untold millions of welfare cards. Just as good as your Visa at any retail outlet. That guy in line in front of you? He should thank you. You paid for his groceries.</p>

<p>No, the sad part is making US taxpayers pay for this FRAUD! This will NEVER stop and that is why White Americans need their own States and own government and self rule! We cannot share the same land with nonwhites because they will never stop with their fraud and lies to take everything we have worked for! </p>
<p>When are WE going to get a long overdue settlement for White Americans who have had their country, their lives, and their heritage STOLEN from them by the enemies within our own government and from the nonwhites in our country? These &#8220;minorities&#8221; KNOW exactly what they are doinfg to us and they LOVE it!  They aren&rsquo;t the innocent little victims they claim to be. We are the real victims of their hatred and greed.</p>

		<p>No matter what, the vast majority of blacks (and browns) will always have their hands out asking for more in the name of oppression. </p>
<p>There is nothing whitey can do - not a black president, not a black Supreme Court justice, not the anti-white racist practices (affirmative action) at our colleges, universities and workplaces, not forty-acres and a mule, not $4.6 billion dollars, not free housing, healthcare, food or clothing - nothing will satisfy colored peoples&rsquo; lust for unearned reparations in America - including those whom are recent arrivals to U.S. shores. Whites will pay for the sin of their skin color, without pause, hesitation or question &hellip; lest they be branded racist. </p>
<p>Explicit white racial conciseness is the ONLY solution to this never-ending dog and pony show. Until then, the cowards in Washington, the disingenuous Tea Partiers, liberals and the silent whites around the country will continue to be the slaves of their own racial impotence, and of the colored peoples&rsquo; ability to use that racial impotence as weapon against them and their future - just ask the race-hustlers: Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. </p>
<p>How, I ask, did we, as a people, become so tragically shameless? I find inspiration and hope in the following: </p>
<p>Since the dawn of history, we have been a mighty people of builders, explorers, artists, warriors, inventors, philosophers and cultivators. We have sailed the seas, tamed vast wildernesses, scaled towering mountains, journeyed to depths of the ocean &hellip; and into the cold void of outer-space. </p>
<p>We have built great civilizations, created breathtaking works of beauty, and made the desserts bloom. The technological achievements of our people, from the megalithic calendar of Stonehenge, to the moon-walk of the Apollo astronauts are unequaled. </p>
<p>We have devised sublime philosophies, conquered deadly diseases and performed soul-searing acts of heroism and self-sacrifice.  </p>
<p>For Christ&rsquo;s sake! The glories and greatness our men and women have won over the centuries should serve as a source of eternal pride and inspiration. </p>
<p>We are the people of Shakespeare, Leonardo Davinci, Beethoven and Homer. We are the sons and daughters of Leaf Erikson, Christopher Columbus, Sir Francis Drake and Magellan. We are the folk of Alexander, Caesar and Washington. We are the descendants of Pythagoras, Gaileo, Copernicus, Newton and Darwin. Just to list the great achievements of our people would require the work of a life time - NO ONE, has more to be proud of than we do. </p>

		<p>OK, anyone not living in the twilight zone can see this is a bogus case of extortion in broad daylight. It really makes you sick to see the money which is wasted and the suckers we have come to be.</p>
<p>Who is to blame for this travesty? Of course the lawyers come to mind - whose greed above everything else is almost Satanic. The black farmers (and seriously - who are these black farmers?) who are playing the race lottery - clueless as ever but demanding money for their own failure. </p>
<p>And in many ways, spineless white idiots who seem almost masochistic in their need to beat up on themselves and their own heritage. </p>
<p>If these black farmers [eyes rolling] spent as much time farming as they have filing 10 gajillion court briefs maybe they&rsquo;d grow something. And what&rsquo;s next - the discriminated black plumbers? </p>
<p>The AR account of the original lawsuit is excellent. And anyone following this debacle through the years can only feel even more demoralized.</p>
<p>Again, and I&rsquo;ve stated this before, it seems blacks simply cannot grasp the bigger picture. They are their own enemies. Because what does the casual observer take away from this if he or she skims the article? That blacks are also incompetent at farming because they screwed up again and now want more money. Because even the most liberal white knows inside - at some level - that it&rsquo;s a scam.</p>
<p>So after this is settled, no one will ever again get involved with blacks in any agribusiness capacity no matter how small. So for the price of a Cadillac blacks have not only publicly embarrassed themselves but whined their way out of another field.</p>
<p>Lastly, and this to me is sickening, are the demeaning admissions of guilt, which are just falsehoods made by hapless whites for public consumption. This only shows why we are where we are because too many other whites probably believe it. For example: </p>
<p>&#8220;Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said with the passage of the Cobell settlement: &#8216;This is a day that will be etched in our memories and our history books.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>What a crock! And how about this gem:</p>
<p>&#8220;Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said passage &#8216;marks a major milestone in USDA&rsquo;s efforts to turn the page on a sad chapter in our history.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly amazing how many &#8220;sad chapters in our history&#8221; have been discovered since LBJ and 1964.<br/>

		<p>How can I ask for and receive reparations for discrination? I am a White American taxpayer and feel discriminated against. Because MY taxes are used to pay off bogus claims. Since I have never owned slaves, nor had any of my ancestors. Since I never profited in any way shape or form from slavery or discrination, I consider myself unfairly singled out for the total waste of taxes I am legally required to pay. The aforesaid waste being these ridiculous pay-offs.</p>

		<p>Discrimination cases? &#8220;The Obama Administration has aggressively moved to resolve these cases!&#8221; Yeah right, and not a peep about the Black Panthers. Lets not forget that the Department of In-Justice considers all cases involving a white suspect and a black victim as either a hate crime or a discrimination case. By it&rsquo;s very nature the civil rights laws are penned to defend solely the rights of non-whites which in itself is discriminatory! And these political elitists think that throwing more money at the problem by raising everybody else&rsquo;s taxes is the solution to this problem? Why should we pay for something that nobody on this planet who is alive had anything to do with to begin with? They initially wanted $100 billion $$$ but settled only for a small fraction of that&hellip;.you think this is over? Oh hell no, once you roll out that reparations wagon they&rsquo;ll never let you put it away, now every Tom, Dick and Harry will be coming out of the wood work of this entitlement nation to get what they believe they have coming to them!</p>

<p>Pigford Funding Questioned</p>
<p>Posted By James Fulford On 21 November 2010 <br/>
Via Dan Riehl, I see that Michele Bachmann is saying that &ldquo;Congress Should Investigate Pigford Before Funding It&ldquo; with an illustration of money rolling off the printing press.</p>
<p>In September, I joined my colleagues Congressmen Steve King (IA-05) and Bob Goodlatte (VA-06) to call for a full investigation into the Pigford Settlement Case. As a constant advocate for careful use of taxpayer dollars, I was concerned when I learned that this Settlement has 94,000 claims of discrimination, even though only approximately 33,000 black farmers exist in the United States.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed in the Senate&rsquo;s decision to disregard these serious allegations and instead vote to spend away billions of taxpayer dollars.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;  <br/>
 <br/>
Actually American blacks are quite a bit better off than blacks in the Congo, or anywhere else in sub Saharan Africa. American blacks are better off because the slave trade introduced their ancestors to a civilization vastly superior to anything they have ever developed, and vastly superior to anything they are capable of developing.   <br/>
 <br/>
Contemporary whites have not benefited from the slave trade. Think of what American history would be like without the Civil War.  Think of what American cities would be like without white flight from black crime.  Think of how nice it would be if we did not have to spend so much money for welfare and our criminal justice system.  <br/>
 <br/>
On the other hand, look at Haiti to see what blacks do with over two centuries of self rule.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got to agree, Bob; since the government doesn&rsquo;t have any money, they&rsquo;ll borrow this $4.6 billion from China, and the debt will eventually be &#8220;paid off&#8221; in hyper-inflated dollars after being repeatedly rolled over, and AvgDude has hit the nail on the head when he says it is really just a stimulus package for stores that sell liquor, high-end athletic shoes, greasy fast food, hair extensions and home theater electronics.  By the end of next year, not one dollar of this payout will remain in the hands of the recipients because as we already know, those folks do not save money.</p>

		<p>Gen Sherman took my family&rsquo;s slaves away during his rape of Georgia. They had something like four lots of them which represented a considerable amount of money.  </p>
<p>I want payment plus interest from the US Government for our slave property.  Should be a tidy sum by now.</p>

		<p>Actually, I have no problem with this. Many of those farmers were shamefully discriminated against. also amnyof them are older Blacks in their late 60s, 70s and 80s </p>
<p>Excuse me for being so blunt, but really, what kind of nonsense is this? It just shows the average American is so far removed from farming it hurts.  Pray tell what has happened to white farms? Squeezed off their land that their forefathers cleared and settled. A farmer was told how much he gets for his produce, and if the cost of producing it is higher, toughsky. Get big or get out. I just read how many farms have closed down since 2000, and I thought it was already rock bottom low then. In my neighborhood, two Amish dairy farms were just auctioned off. When I heard the milk price had been lowered, I thought, oh oh, they are going after the last few family farms. <br/>
Stalin was more honest in just kicking them off the land and taking it over. Here it was done more subtle and hypocritical.  And now I am supposed to cry for black farmers. WHAT ABOUT THE DEFRAUDED Former WHITE FARMERS?  If you think your food is coming from a farm, think again. </p>
<p>#12<br/>
That blacks are also incompetent at farming because they screwed up again and now want more money. </p>
<p>What black farmers?  I guess if it was not for mean whitey, there would be blooming, prosperous black farms? Just like in Africa I suppose. </p>
<p>#12<br/>
So after this is settled, no one will ever again get involved with blacks in any agribusiness capacity no matter how small.</p>
<p>I live in the country. There are no black farmers around. However, the head of the USDA at the county level is a black woman. The farmer&rsquo;s market manager, (it has to be directed from above now, can&rsquo;t just sell your corn, maters and eggs, no, you have to take classes and pass tests on how to wash your hands, etc.) yep, that guy is black too. There are not many blacks in this county, and other counties have even less. This is considered a white State. Everything is regulated, and blacks are in the thick of the regulating. Just wait until S-510 gets passed. <br/>
This is a smart move actually, most Americans are too dumb about farms to realize what hogwash this is, and the younger generation is totally clueless.<br/>
 <br/>
I can not say anything about it in connection with Indians. I simply don&rsquo;t know. </p>

		<p>Black Farmers? Not only have I ever met one, I never saw one here in the northeast. Never, never in my years of reading Farm Journal, Hordes Dairyman, Country Folks, American Agricultarist did I see a picture or read about a Black farmer.</p>
<p>When I see sales figures of John Deere, New Holland, Case Ih and all other related U.S. machinery manufactures rise, then I will believe. Believe in the validity of this case or the bogus hoax I&rsquo;m afraid it has become. </p>

What are you talking about? There were reports that many of these black &#8220;farmers&#8221; grew nothing but weeds and tomato patches, etc. and gave away most of it to neighbors and family.</p>
<p> Do you honestly believe that this payoff at our expense was on the up and up? My long dead father and mother should have gotten more than these people!  They had a backyard full of grapes, peach trees, orange trees, tomatoes, etc. and never got a cent or a loan from the government I will wager these black &#8220;farmers&#8221; had no such thing!</p>
<p>Where are these poster&rsquo;s coming from of late? They sure do seem to defend nonwhites no matter what.</p>

		<p>If this keeps up for much longer the Caucasian nation of Georgia, in addition to welcoming in South African Boers, will also soon offer impoverished white American farmers asylum.</p>
