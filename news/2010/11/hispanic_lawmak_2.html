			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Martin, San Antonio Express-News, Nov. 17, 2010 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Congressional Hispanic Caucus leaders huddled with President Barack Obama on Tuesday to discuss immigration issues and the lame-duck Congress, but no clear strategy emerged. </p>
<p>Obama and Hispanic Democrats reiterated their support for the DREAM Act, which would provide a path for citizenship for immigrant youths illegally brought into the United States before they were 16, and both called for the House and Senate to vote on the measure before Congress adjourns for the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a clear Democratic commitment in order to persuade Republicans, who are needed to get us over the finish line, to step forward,&#8221; said Rep. Lu√≠s Gutierrez, D-Ill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A last-minute push for the DREAM Act comes as Republicans prepare to take control of the House and pick up seats in the Senate in the 112th Congress, which convenes in January.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democrats failed to get the DREAM Act passed in the Senate earlier this year when they attached the immigration measure, as well as a repeal of the &#8216;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&#8221; policy on gays and lesbians in the military, to a defense spending bill.</p>
<p>Republicans who once favored the Dream Act opposed it as an addition to the defense bill, and further pressure is mounting on GOP members who favor the immigration measure from tea party activists who oppose it as an &#8220;amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DREAM Act, or Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, would require the affected youths to enter the armed forces or attend college for two years, clear a background check and have no criminal records to be eligible for citizenship.</p>
<p>Roughly 800,000 teens and young adults would be eligible, according to immigration rights groups.</p>
<p>The DREAM Act enjoyed bipartisan support in the past. It has since been caught up in the rancorous immigration reform debate.</p>

		<p>We have told the new Republicans as well as those returned, if you play games with us again, that&rsquo;s it for you.  Republicans, if you want to destroy your party, go ahead and dream.  It will become a nightmare for you.</p>
<p>Already I am getting phone calls for money.  I will not give any until I am sure that this issue, illegal aliens, is dealt with in favor of the American people.  With some exceptions, most Hispanics vote democratic anyway.  So we want to hand the communist democrats the ability to win elections in perpetuity?</p>

		<p>If the DREAM Act is passed, the illegal alien &#8220;children&#8221; will be able to sponsor for citizenship their parents(who broke the law in the first place),siblings, aunts, uncles, etc. This is known as chain migration.  This bill needs to be defeated!</p>

		<p>Perhaps in the amnesty-heaven days of George &#8220;Compassionate&#8221; Bush Jr, some of the GOP like Grandad McCain and &#8220;pure as Snowe&#8221; would vote for the &#8220;DREAM&#8221;. Not now.  </p>
<p>These Hispano-lobbyists are drinking the super-grade mesquite tequila if they think any GOP member of Congress, after this election and in this economy is going to do anything to grease the college path for Son of Sneaky Pedro.</p>
<p>Let them hit up super-libs Buffett and Bill Gates for tuition.</p>

		<p>This whole DREAM thing will change nothing. It won&rsquo;t stop illegal immigration or entice enough of them to enter the military etc&hellip; I for one don&rsquo;t want someone in this country illegally in our military.<br>
It&rsquo;s all fluff and nonsense.</p>

		<p>Okay, lets ask the simplest questions..if amnesty is<br>
be given to those brought her illegally before they were<br>
16..how can this be proven? Every illegal will claim they came<br>
before they were 16 and who is to say otherwise? <br>
Then there is the &#8220;tuition&#8221; for minors..which extends<br>
to age 35. Then there is the option to extend amnesty<br>
to the immediate family members of the &#8220;minor&#8221;.</p>
<p>THE DREAM ACT WILL FUNCTION AS BLANKET AMNESTY JUST AS INTENDED</p>

		<p>The DREAM Act. Sounds lovely, doesn&rsquo;t it? When they take away the First Amendment, I hope they think up an equally snazzy name, so I can feel good about loosing what&rsquo;s left of my rights.</p>

<p>More like the Destruction, Replacement, and Eradication by Alien Marauders Act, in my book!</p>
<p>Some dream that is; these Republican fools coming in had better realize that this sort of diversity &ldquo;development,&rdquo; was not what they were elected for. In fact, it was the very opposite, those &ldquo;800,000 teens and young adult&rdquo; invaders need to be removed without remorse or compunction, right along with their parents. Simply because the Commiecrats and their General Secretary Obama wish for a &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; on the issue, is not a reason to do it, nor should it be. </p>
<p>Does a mongoose &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; with a cobra? Of course not, unless the mongoose wants a kiss full of venom and quick death.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

California is bankrupt because it has an economy largely based on criminal alien labor. California is now the nightmare state.</p>

		<p>The idea that the Dream Act could pass in the lame duck is a pipe dream, and Obama and the pro-illegal Hispanics know it.  So is the notion that DADT abolition will somehow get past filibusters in the Senate in the few precious days before this session ends.  But the gays are promised the moon anyway.  <br>
Most people are concerned with rising taxes, extention of unemployment benefits, a Social Security bonus, and other monetary matters.  Yet Obama continues to make a fool of himself pandering to minority concerns and letting the world know it.</p>

		<p>There are more sinister aspects to the DREAM Act that we should be careful about, aspects that end up getting strengthened even if the DREAM Act is defeated.  Presently, illegal aliens can serve in the military and male illegals are required to fill out the Selective Service card.  Both these points grant illegal aliens an implicit legitimacy to living in the United States, a legitimacy that we should not be giving.</p>
<p>It is not enough to stop the DREAM act   &mdash;   we also need to prohibit illegal aliens from joining the U.S. military or for filling out the Selective Service card.  Ideally, we should also be prohibiting illegal aliens from attending American universities.</p>
<p>Many issues end up being solved via compromise  &mdash;  a middle-of-the-road approach.  If our opponents want the DREAM Act and we don&rsquo;t want the DREAM Act but are silent about illegals serving in the military or attending college, the halfway point may very well suggest that we will lose.  If we take a much tougher position, that not only should the DREAM Act not be passed, but illegals should not even be attending U.S. colleges or serving in the military to begin with, the middle-of-the-road compromise will be that illegals can still serve in the military &amp; be able to go to U.S. colleges but that the DREAM Act legalization clauses will not be passed.  So in meeting our opponents halfway, we need to make sure that our way is sufficient distant enough so that halfway will be palatable.</p>
