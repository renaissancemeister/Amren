<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only 12 percent of black fourth-grade boys are proficient in reading, compared with 38 percent of white boys, and only 12 percent of black eighth-grade boys are proficient in math, compared with 44 percent of white boys.</p>
<p>Poverty alone does not seem to explain the differences: poor white boys do just as well as African-American boys who do not live in poverty, measured by whether they qualify for subsidized school lunches.</p>
<p>{snip} The report, &#8220;A Call for Change,&#8221; is to be released Tuesday by the Council of the Great City Schools, an advocacy group for urban public schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s accumulating evidence that there are racial differences in what kids experience before the first day of kindergarten,&#8221; said Ronald Ferguson, director of the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard. &#8220;They have to do with a lot of sociological and historical forces. In order to address those, we have to be able to have conversations that people are unwilling to have.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I thought the 4th grade was the last time that blacks and white<br>
were equal. As students mature the achievement gap gets wider and <br>
wider. But never mind all that..the real purpose of all <br>
such &#8220;honesty&#8221; on the part of the Educrats is to find<br>
way to scam more money</p>

		<p>When long term expectations are not in accord with what has been demonstrated to be the case time and time again, then one must presume we are dealing with delusional people.  The report confirms it:</p>
<p><i>The nation&rsquo;s young Black males&hellip;do not have the same opportunities as their male or female counterparts across the country.</i></p>
<p>Or is it that they do not take good advantage of their situation, and squander their multiple opportunities?</p>
<p><i>Black males continue to perform lower than their peers (sic) throughout the country on almost every indicator.</i></p>
<p>Excuse me, but black males are their own peers.  I do not think that a Chinese kid studying at home 4 hours a night is a &#8220;peer&#8221; of any black.</p>
<p><i>[We should] marshal the energies of&hellip;national organizations&hellip;on behalf of Black male youth. Such groups might include the NBA, the music industry&hellip;</i></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking education, and the solution is the National Basketball Association, and record companies?  Are these people serious?</p>
<p><i>Ensure that Black male students are taking the requisite courses at the appropriate level of rigor beginning in late elementary school&hellip;to ensure that they are on track academically for high school graduation.</i></p>
<p>No, they are not serious.  Interestingly, in the report we read about free school lunches, etc. as if this is a learning factor.  But in the entire report there is not one mention of IQ.  Unbelievable.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to address those, we have to be able to have conversations that people are unwilling to have.&#8221;</p>
<p>And everyone here at American Renaissance would like nothing more than for society to &#8220;have conversations that people are unwilling to have,&#8221; because we know who will win most of these debates.</p>

		<p>It almost seems as if the writer is close to considering the possibility that there might be differences in average level of inherited thinking skills among ethnic group but then pulls back from the precipice. At least it should cause some open minded thinkers to dare to take the step of looking into literature like &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; and other works which finally arrive at the only logical conclusions which an intelligent and objective person can arrive at in this regard.</p>

		<p>We do need to have a conversation about racial matters. It just so happens however that &#8220;some people&#8221; are unwilling to entertain such a conversation unless it is entirely driven by a certain ideological persuasion, without dissent. What the good professor really wants is a lecture. A monologue where he and other marxists can stand before a white audience and proudly (and ever so stylishly) condemn them.</p>

		<p>So they blame it on sending them to &#8216;failing schools.&rsquo; If the whites are going to the same &#8216;failing schools&rsquo; as the blacks and the school is the problem, then wouldn&rsquo;t it stand to reason that the blacks would be failing at the same ratio as the whites? </p>

		<p>The problem is liberal control of the schools. </p>
<p>Years ago, in non-liberal controled schools, blacks did about as well as whites with comparable I.Q.&rsquo;s and attending the same school. I observed this myself in the 1950&rsquo;s. If anything low I.Q.(less than 85) blacks did better scholasticly than whites with the same I.Q. I think the blacks&rsquo; greater language capability was the main factor. In any event, public schools should consentrate giving a good education to each child, but be realistic about what is possible. A student&rsquo;s I.Q., mental health, and motivation are factors that must be weighted in  evaluating a school&rsquo;s success in educating that student.</p>
<p>The only problem would be that Ronald Ferguson and the achievement gappers  at Harvard would be unemployed.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They have to do with a lot of sociological and historical forces&#8221;.  This is the leftist mantra we constantly hear - that race is merely a social construct. Somebody linked (on my blog) to an amazing essay, which shows that this mantra has no science behind it whatsoever. Though the source page has been removed, I had saved it and it now appears on my blog:</p>

		<p>An old friend of mine who teaches high school science and math often notes that some of his better students each year are black females, while in his 25 year career he can count the number of good black male students on his fingers. The girls are not necessarily brilliant, and many are no better than the boys, but a certain number seem capable of applying themselves and getting somewhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing that makes me think twice whenever commenters here bring up the racial differences/low IQ argument. Why would the females of a particular race be genetically more intellectually gifted than the males?</p>

		<p>Most states have high school proficiency tests that a moron could pass. Now most blacks don&rsquo;t pass these tests. So I leave it to the reader to describe a person who can&rsquo;t pass a moron-friendly test. Having said that, the tests themselves should be abolished. Let the blacks finish high school. Who cares? </p>
<p>Well the taxpayers, but not even the Tea Party wants to do what is right which is to throw idiots out of the public school system at age 12 and put them in either practical occupation courses or train them to kill Muslims so the military has a defined mission. </p>
<p>But since we are trying to win the hearts and minds of Muslims, why even put the lives of academically hopeless blacks at risk? Just give them the opportunity to learn to build or repair things, and if they can&rsquo;t do that, simply let them fend for themselves without food stamps, medicaid or housing assistance. Same for our Latino folks, assuming some are legal, which some are. </p>

		<p>This is it. They have finally run out of excuses. Now it&rsquo;s off to  the straw dogs.</p>
<p>The implication is that before a black child (ages 2-5 group) gets to school, he or she is affected substantially by sociological and historical forces (yet to be identified and defined by these lunatics). So, a child who can barely say, &#8220;Ma ma&#8221;, sits in the living room playing with toys and hears Mom and Dad argue about the woes of being black and this lowers the child&rsquo;s ability to learn later on? The child has a high I.Q., but when exposed to seeing old ghetto buildings and hearing gunshots at night, it suppresses his/her reading/math comprehension indefinitely? And seeing a white child with a better tricycle and more toys lowers the black child&rsquo;s self esteem to the point he or she just can&rsquo;t compete in the classroom?</p>
<p>On second thought, forget the grasping at straw dogs; they&rsquo;ve drilled a hole in the bottom of the barrel and are just plain GONE.</p>

Although the outlines of the problem and many specifics have been previously reported, the group hopes that including so much of what it calls &ldquo;jaw-dropping data&rdquo; in one place will spark a new sense of national urgency. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Mo Money, Mo Money, Mo Money.</p>
<p>Quick, before they kick out the great black hoax and the whole fraud begins to collapse in on itself for want of any funding at all.</p>
<p>Of course, the money -could- be spent wisely, on genetics studies and long sequence searches for the origins of high IQs which should be easier to isolate in Blacks because the difference in mean and 115+ is so large, statistically.</p>
<p>But that would mean Mo Money for something other than the scream-about-the-symptoms enablers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The report shows that black boys on average fall behind from their earliest years. Black mothers have a higher infant mortality rate and black children are twice as likely as whites to live in a home where no parent has a job. In high school, African-American boys drop out at nearly twice the rate of white boys, and their SAT scores are on average 104 points lower. In college, black men represented just 5 percent of students in 2008. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It may not help much.  Certainly a lack of breast feeding and infant intimacy are very important shortcomings but the fact is that we have been seeing these deficits in children as young as three.  And our history (including noted men like Thomas Jeffferson) includes many anecdotes stating that while blacks have innate qualities of warmth, rote memorization and some forms of verbal skill, they _do not_ conceptualize as well as we do.</p>
<p>Conceptual Verbal beats &#8216;Performance&rsquo; Verbal in every professional trade their is because the ability to use words as symbolic shorthand translates between visual and sequential driven creativity in ways that even the East Asians have not completely mastered.</p>
<p>Both of those together indicate, not a &#8216;sociological&rsquo; or &#8216;historical&rsquo; shortcoming in black educational abilities but a _genetic_ one.  And Genetics for blacks is an unrecorded history of thousands of years in one the most hostile environments on the planet, outside of arctic regions.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The analysis of results on the national tests found that math scores in 2009 for black boys were not much different than those for black girls in Grades 4 and 8, but black boys lagged behind Hispanics of both sexes, and they fell behind white boys by at least 30 points, a gap sometimes interpreted as three academic grades. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And what happens to little black boys and girs between grades four and eight people?  That&rsquo;s right.  Puberty hits them like a ton of bricks.  And the testosterone surge shuts down whatever &#8216;innocence&rsquo; they have as a means to enjoy learning for it&rsquo;s own sake rather than a means to exploit the environment for dominance and handouts.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The search for explanations has recently looked at causes besides poverty, and this report may further spur those efforts. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Blatherskate and Bloviation, covering for SHEER TERROR that it might be true.  Blacks know they have long since run out of excuses and they are starting to see that white&rsquo;s ability to just go along with the program because &#8216;the government says so&rsquo; is also at an end, with the rise of a third political party alternative which can cut entitlements in half, for purely national-survival reasons.</p>
<p>And you know what is truly pathetic here?  The scientific, academic and government medical/educational agencies that should be exploring this issue _make our case for us_.  By ignoring the works of Jensen and Murray and other, HIGHLY qualified researchers.  Not refuting them.  But ignoring them entirely.</p>
<p>As book after book is published whose Bell Curve predictions are deemed &#8216;unwholesome truths&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The report urges convening a White House conference, encouraging Congress to appropriate more money for schools and establishing networks of black mentors. </p>
<p>What it does not discuss are policy responses identified with a robust school reform movement that emphasizes closing failing schools, offering charter schools as alternatives and raising the quality of teachers. </p>
<p>The report did not go down this road because &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a lot of research to indicate that many of those strategies produce better results,&rdquo; Mr. Casserly said. </p>
<p>Other have a different response. The key to narrowing the achievement gap, said Dr. Ferguson, is &ldquo;really good teaching.&rdquo; <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Nope, none of the above.  In fact, I&rsquo;m going to go Cosby Level Radical on you idiots:  Let&rsquo;s talk eugenics.</p>
<p>1.  Begin massive long-sequence and anatomical studies correlation efforts to find the the morphological, biochemical and associated genetic allele locations which differential smart people from not so smart people, at all levels and for all races.  Let&rsquo;s then consider an effort equivalent to the Apollo Moon Landings (and apt to be far more longterm useful) to give everyone a 20 point increase over their current racial means by no later than 2050.  That means every kid born after 2020 is a &#8216;genie&rsquo;.  A genomically improved, healthier, smarter, kid.</p>
<p>2.  Lets design school programs which appeal to specifically mapped out psychometric norms for race and IQ groups, not just as a specific CA/MA level but as a function of the specific -kinds- of IQ (visual, spatial, mathematics) that they have.  For those that have lower IQs, let&rsquo;s be honest and get them into vocational training -fast-, before they lose patience with the educational system.  And then let&rsquo;s compensate those who -will work- with say a 10,000 dollar a year dispensation.  I would, by far, rather pay a little extra for someone to work at a 10-15,000 dollar a year job than not work at all.</p>
<p>3.  Controlled Breeding.<br>
Negative Eugenics for some, positives for others.  Everyone below a certain mean IQ (say 95) gets 10,000 dollars, free and clear, for sterilization after their first kid.  White, black, hispanic, doesn&rsquo;t matter.  For those with 110 or above, there is a similar award (perhaps a college guarantee) for having THREE kids.  And finally we make everyone pay for all education, after their first kid.  That means you pay for 6-12 on every brat you make.</p>
<p>I would like to see someone sit down with some college educated blacks and have that kind of a conversation.  But this &#8220;We know it&rsquo;s rough, living on welfare, but you have to /promise/ to be nice to Shaqeeem, even when your drunk or high&hellip;&#8221; is a zero-sum game for lower class people who themselves are lucky to operate on an 85-87 IQ.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;Hispanic kids and African-American kids this year had a lower dropout rate than white kids,&rdquo; Mr. Alonso said. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is why things have to change.  We are pushing white kids to act like blacks and hispanics and either they are taking us up on it.  Or they are rebelling and refusing to do cut-and-paste &#8216;group hug&rsquo; stuff and so are being X&rsquo;d out of their own future by an LCD effect that is NOT THEIR FAULT.</p>
<p>This thing is  winnable people.  We have to start getting away from RAH and applying some sound theory and acceptable tradeoffs, socially.  But we now have the technology and knowledge base to beat the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we admitted that and got started fixing the species as the next major step in evolution becomes a medical one.</p>

&#8220;Poverty alone does not seem to explain the differences: &hellip;&#8221;<br>
 <br>
1) In the 1940&rsquo;s Japanese Americans were living in internment camps. By the late 1960&rsquo;s they have outperformed whites, measured by median income.</p>
<p>2) In the 1970&rsquo;s the Vietnamese came to the USA as war refugees. By the early 2000&rsquo;s their household income equaled whites according to US census bureau statistics.</p>

		<p>Wow, when I saw &#8220;They (reasons for the gap) have to do with a lot of sociological and historical forces&#8221;, I naturally assumed Mr. Ferguson would proceed to once again lay the blame on us Blue-Eyed Devils, but no, he&rsquo;s going out on a limb and actually suggesting that the parents and Black community need to step up. It&rsquo;s not likely to close the gap completely, especially if there really is a genetic component to the gap, as many of us suspect, but it&rsquo;s a big step in the right direction as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Unfortunately, to paraphrase Mr. Ferguson, it&rsquo;s most likely a conversation certain people are <i>really</i> unwilling to have. </p>

		<p>I had a biracial woman in her late twenties hired into my workplace who had a Masters degree out of Baltimore, MD. She was very attractive and soon had my supervisor and male coworkers eating out of her hand. She played her biracial cards and sexuality right and eventually became the supervisor of my office.</p>
<p>But I was very surprised when she had to read out loud to us for the first time. Here she was with this college degree and yet could hardly read beyond a second to third grade level. It took her 5 minutes to stumble through a one page memo. Embarassingly uncomfortable to have to sit through.</p>
<p>Made me wonder how she made it through college. All the way to a Masters without being able to read? That confirmed for me that they&rsquo;re just handing out degrees to anyone with the right skin pigmentation. Or maybe she slept her way to it. Or both.</p>

What he does not include, however, are &#8220;conversations&#8221; about basic differences in I.Q.&rsquo;s.  His suggestions are a good start, but I wonder how lasting an impact such changes would really bring.  </p>

1) Conversations about early childhood parenting practices </p>
<p>2) The activities that parents conduct with their 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds </p>

		<p>Great. Now tell me something I do not know. This report is like announcing, &#8220;Sun Continues to Rise in East.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sad part is that despite the problem nothing is done to work it. For example, the problem, if you will, is low black academic achievement. So, the next question should be why. Then, what should be done to correct it, and if it can&rsquo;t be corrected, then to accommodate it. </p>
<p>However, despite the obvious answer to why - the nation&rsquo;s &#8220;educators&#8221; are stuck at that question. Unable to find the politically correct answer, they can never move on to how to accommodate it best - like vocational schools or a different curriculum or enhanced discipline with social training or segregation or reduced expectations or whatever.</p>
<p>Fifty years from now they&rsquo;ll be still be spinning excuses - even more preposterous than the ones appearing now - for black intellectual failure. It doesn&rsquo;t take a research scientist to see it is largely genetic. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but you can&rsquo;t excuse that away. Nor can you excuse away inherently poor impulse control or a lack of logical reasoning skills. You either deal with it - or deal with consequences of denying it. America&rsquo;s downward spiral is because of the latter.</p>

		<p>For the umpteenth time another article on the achievement gap between blacks and Hispanics compared with whites and Asians comes out, with the usual half-hearted attempts to find out what the problem&rsquo;s cause is and what are viable solutions. It was just another &#8220;exercise in futility&#8221; since the core issue, differences in average, inherited intelligence between the two groups cannot be touched upon.</p>
<p>Despite most whites not being exposed to publications and web sites which point out the real truth of the matter, or books like<br>
&#8220;Race and Reason&#8221; or &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; which do this, I have the idea that basic logic and common sense is making more and more come to the forbidden conclusions about race and intelligence which the &#8220;official&#8221; media and education system don&rsquo;t allow them to reach because of denying publication of facts which would allow such truths to be brought out.</p>
<p>Partly this may have to do with the sports analogy: Anyone who follows the running and jumping sports of basketball and American football has to instinctively realize, without being told this by publications or commentators, that blacks, on average, are better equipped genetically to excel in such sports. No amount of top level coaching of white players can overcome this inherited advantage so that there will always exist a vast achievement gap in terms of racial background of players achieving success in these two sports.</p>
<p>So in a similar way, whites who have drawn these racially based conclusions in sports will then be able to make similar conclusions when it comes to reasons for different levels of outcomes in academic achievement. If it is the case, despite decades of money and effort sunk into bringing up the academic results of black and Hispanic students, that by 8th grade there is about a three grade level gap between blacks and Hispanics on the one hand and whites and Asians on the other, then what other conclusion is possible other than, on average, whites and Asians have higher genetically determined intellectual abilities than blacks and Hispanics in the United States?</p>
<p>More and more people are seeing that the official line, &#8220;the Emperor does have clothes on,&#8221; is just not true.</p>

		<p>This report is more of the &#8220;same old, same old&#8221;. I think what surprised these researchers is the fact that poor white boys score just as well as well-off Bantu boys not receiving free school lunches.</p>
<p>Good! We were always told that poverty, poverty and poverty were the causes of this achievement gap, with &#8220;lack of opportunity&#8221; being thrown in for good measure. Of course, nobody is going to pinpoint the REAL reason for the gap. Their solutions are the same old bromides - more money.</p>
<p>I note that 5% of college students are Bantu men. Given that NCAA college football and basketball teams are around 60-100% Bantu in makeup, it&rsquo;s not hard to guess what they&rsquo;re in school for - the fat sports contract. Good luck with that, seeing there are a finite number of positions available among the baseball, football and basketball rosters.</p>
<p>To Bon (re post # 5):</p>
<p>Good points. When Nobel laureate James Watson opined his reasons as to why lower Bantu achievement, we remember what happened to him, don&rsquo;t we? As long as you don&rsquo;t talk about racial differences, you&rsquo;re OK.</p>

		<p>More of the same. The truth to the problem is unspeakable in mainstream America, so it will never be solved. The sad part is that most Americans know the truth, but because of fear of social ostracization never say it. Even leftists who champion diversity are very aware. If you look at the inter-racial adoption rates, it&rsquo;s plain to see that they know genetics plays a strong role. Blacks make up the majority of adoptable children, yet liberals pay more and wait longer to adopt a child from Asia or even central America, before they&rsquo;ll adopt a Black. Only the most devout leftists bring a Black child into their home. Blacks, and especially Black boys, remain the least preferred children to adopt. It&rsquo;s no wonder why.</p>

		<p>School standards in the US have been dumbed down to make it easier for blacks to cope with (not that it has helped much). This will be detrimental to the competitiveness of US science and technology in the future.</p>
<p>This is a main reason for most of the current engineering and science graduate students in the US to be foreigners. In all those countries, school standards are a lot tougher and those students have a clear edge over American students on entrance tests.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s accumulating evidence that there are racial differences in what kids experience before the first day of kindergarten,&rdquo; said Ronald Ferguson, director of the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard. &ldquo;They have to do with a lot of sociological and historical forces.

<p>Ha, ha. You see, there&rsquo;s this vial of cyanide over here. when people drink it, they die. This has to do with a lot of sociological and historical forces. These are likely the same forces that dictate how people get crushed when pianos fall on them from the tenth story, or perhaps what that big orange hot thing is, that (seems) to rise about every day in what we believe, in our own judgmental minds to be the &#8220;East.&#8221;</p>
<p>No doubt we have to have a lot of conversations that people are unwilling to have, unless we want to be poisoned, crushed, or burned by the big fireball that mysteriously appears every day.<br>
And THAT, people, is the timid, gutless, sniveling mind of the political aparachik and/ or public employee, or office seeker.<br>
THAT&rsquo;s why America is NOT worth saving.</p>
<p>Veterans day is upon us. <br>
Do you think that all those dead marines washing back and forth in the waves of the pacific islands, or all those merchant Seamen who hit the Icy cold North Atlantic waters to drown and freeze in five minutes, DIED FOR THIS?</p>

Those on both ends of the political spectrum tend to avoid viewpoints they do not share.  Nevertheless, conservatives have not tried to make it dangerous to argue in public that global warming is happening, that it is a serious problem, and that humans are responsible.  Liberals have generally succeeded in making it dangerous to publicly agree with The Bell Curve.  <br>
 <br>
Many people have claimed to disprove The Bell Curve.  Many more make that claim on their behalf.  The Bell Curve will be disproven when blacks on the average perform and behave as well as whites.  <br>
 <br>
BTW, I bet that liberal married couple lives in a safe, white neighborhood, and would never send their children to a predominately black public school. White liberals pretend to disagree with The Bell Curve.  In their behavior they reveal a clandestine awareness that what Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein say is true. </p>

<p>Years ago, in non-liberal controled schools, blacks did about as well as whites with comparable I.Q.&rsquo;s and attending the same school. I observed this myself in the 1950&rsquo;s. If anything low I.Q.(less than 85) blacks did better scholasticly than whites with the same I.Q. I think the blacks&rsquo; greater language capability was the main factor. </p>
<p><br>
Blacks&rsquo; &#8220;greater language capability&#8221;? Really? </p>
<p>Would that be the same &#8220;greater language capability&#8221; that renders a HUGE fraction of blacks   &mdash;   regardless of their educational or socioeconomic levels   &mdash;   genetically incapable of pronouncing the THREE LETTERS of the word &#8220;ask&#8221; in the correct sequence? </p>
<p>Or are you perhaps referring to the &#8220;greater language capability&#8221; that allows black rappers to rhyme &#8220;ho&#8221; with &#8220;yo&#8221;, &#8220;blow&#8221;, and &#8220;Ah wants some mo&rsquo;&#8221;? </p>

		<p>So what happens when we go back and address those &#8220;sociological&#8221; and &#8220;historical&#8221; forces that affect black children before they enter elementary school and find out that they still cannot compete at the same level as white children? Then what?</p>
<p>Or is what&rsquo;s happening here that &#8220;sociological&#8221; and &#8220;historical&#8221; forces are going to be used as a sort of magic that will be used to explain the difference in achievement forever, without ever uttering the taboo word &#8220;genetics?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why would the females of a particular race be genetically more intellectually gifted than the males?&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, female IQs tend to cluster towards the center of the bell curve, whereas male IQs spread out on both sides.  In other words: fewer female geniuses, &amp; fewer female idiots.   Men have far more of both.  This coresponds to my own observations of women: We tend to be pretty average. </p>
<p>With an average IQ &amp; a bit of self discipline &amp; application, one can do well in much of American academia.  Most of it doesn&rsquo;t require a high IQ, it just takes a bit of hard work &amp; focus, which the guys tend to lack.   That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re really seeing when black women out-perform black men.  </p>

A Black Achievement Gap, and Wasted Potential<br>
Published: November 12, 2010 <br>
       <br>
Re &ldquo;Proficiency of Black Students Is Found to Be Far Lower Than Expected&rdquo; (news article, Nov. 9): </p>
<p>Receiving a high school diploma should be a normal rite of passage for all youth in our nation, not a result of overcoming immense odds. For a country whose core principles include equal opportunity and racial justice, the results reported for &ldquo;A Call to Change,&rdquo; by the Council of the Great City Schools, coming right after the Schott Foundation&rsquo;s report on the same subject with similar results, represent a tragedy of the highest level. </p>
<p>The wasted potential of our black youth represented by the reported data is breathtaking. Your article notes that the achievement gap begins in the black boys&rsquo; earliest years. Initiatives that provide life coaches for elementary school-age black boys, coupled with early literacy activities and parental involvement, have shown early promise. </p>
<p>Perhaps they can serve as an example of the kind of intensive supports that make a difference in the lives of black male students.  <br>
 <br>

 <br>
Black males in school have had plenty of &#8220;intensive supports&#8221; for years that have been paid for by white tax payers.  We cannot support what is not there.  Those who cannot perform at a twelfth grade level do not deserve high school diplomas.  <br>

<p>Do you suppose living in a home where there&rsquo;s no real structure to the day has an adverse effect on organizational skills later on?</p>
<p>Maybe something as simple as &#8220;We all get up and have breakfast together before Daddy goes off to work&#8221; and &#8220;We all sit down and have dinner together after Daddy comes home&#8221; gives kids a framework for &#8220;what is time&#8221; and &#8220;how to plan ahead&#8221; and &#8220;how to make sense of the structure of things&#8221; later on.  </p>

<p>&#8221; But I was very surprised when she had to read out loud to us for the first time. Here she was with this college degree and yet could hardly read beyond a second to third grade level &hellip; All the way to a Masters without being able to read? &#8220;<br>
=================</p>
<p>Did she sound intelligent in normal conversation?  Did she have logical thought processes, did she understand new ideas, was she able to discuss topics in depth?  If so, maybe she&rsquo;s one of the unfortunates who has a reading disability (apparently there are several different kinds; some involve not-seeing the differences between letters, others are based on not seeing that words come in repeating patterns of letters).  There are lots of bright people who have real problems with written words; but in normal conversational situations they demonstrate excellent understanding and reasoning.  </p>
<p>I believe studies show there&rsquo;s a genetic component to this problem&hellip;  who knows, maybe that&rsquo;s part of the black-IQ thing.  As Africans evolved over the centuries, maybe a neural deficit in character-recognition wasn&rsquo;t a drawback.  Maybe in a society where learning is orally transmitted and honed by practical application (which game animals are easy to hunt during certain seasons, which plants are medicinal, what livestock symptoms are cause for alarm) the specific brain circuits for reading, being unused, aren&rsquo;t missed when they don&rsquo;t develop (or maybe it&rsquo;s  the other way around: they aren&rsquo;t stimulated by cultural usage into developing and thus aren&rsquo;t &#8220;selected for&#8221; in Darwin-speak).</p>
<p>Do we know if anybody has done research to see if blacks have a higher proportion of reading-based learning disabilities (which would tend to support my ramblings above)?</p>
