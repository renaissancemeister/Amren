<h1>Detroit Sees 41 Halloween Weekend Fires</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Schaefer, Detroit Free Press, October 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The City of Detroit had 41 fires Friday night through 11 p.m., an increase of seven fires over the same night last year, officials said.</p>
<p>Scores of volunteers are expected out on the streets again tonight as the city enters a critical portion of the three-day Angel&rsquo;s Night anti-arson campaign.</p>
<p>{snip} Volunteers will be out on the streets asking residents to keep an eye on vacant structures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In early September, Detroit fire fighters and helpers from suburban departments battled dozens of fires one night when high winds fanned flames that burned more than 80 buildings and homes.<br>

		<p>Detroit is a lost city; it is more like a third world wasteland than it is a Midwestern community.</p>
<p>Deterioration, whites fleeing, economic collapse, disease, crime, cultural decay, and now fires? Is there any end to the decline of Detroit?</p>
<p>Imagine how it would have been without all of the volunteers!<br>

		<p>What on earth is wrong with these (blacks)?<br>
Is there anyplace on the Planet Earth where they have ever done anything of value?<br>
At one time Detroit was a Jewel in the Crown of America, now it is black controlled and it&rsquo;s not even safe for blacks to walk the streets in broad daylight.<br>
Not everyone is destined or deserving of being in charge.<br>
Hasn&rsquo;t Obama proven that?</p>

		<p>Blacks seen to be masters at burning down their own neighborhoods. </p>
<p>When I was attending a majority black high school in Gary, someone snuck in in the middle of the night and set fire to the auditorium, nearly burning the whole place down and knocking out access to the school library for a year and a half. I know I must  be racist for suspecting the perpetrator was black. </p>
<p>A wind-swept fire one October years later burned down a large portion of the downtown area. </p>
<p>Fires were so common on Ridge Road in Gary that if a building was nice but unoccupied, I knew it was just a matter of time before it would be reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>But how can that be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diversity&rdquo; and Marxism have been Detroit&rsquo;s organ transplant for nearly 41 years now. So, what has gone &ldquo;wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is it that Detroit is now above the &ldquo;rainbow,&rdquo; or as I like to call it, in the black hole?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Better idea than putting fires out, taking out big insurance policies and leaving oily rags and gas cans around. Maybe if you are lucky you will hit the jackpot and get to move out of Detroit!</p>

		<p>Most of what could be burned down has been burned down a long time ago. The &#8220;Devils Night&#8221; has been a practice engaged in for over two decades now. The numbers of fires used to be in the hundreds, sometimes almost a thousand? At least hundreds. Most combustible buildings now already gone, not much left to burn. Wasteland mostly gone back to nature. Probably the better for it too.</p>

		<p>Happy Halloween from Detroit - the only city where an event for  children and known for candy and costumes is instead marked by people trying to literally burn the city down. Where the mayor has to plead with the residents not to light their own blocks on fire.</p>
<p>This is a disgrace to our European ancestors that we let this happen - that we welcomed into our lands a race that does not act in a manner befitting civilized people.</p>
<p>If you think about it - the blacks in Detroit have actually destroyed a city built by whites. Where does this end?</p>

		<p>Not &#8220;their own neighborhood&#8221;, Tim.  Detroit was MY hometown.  Mine, and many other whites, who built it and thrived there.  Until blacks moved in, drove out the whites, and totally destroyed OUR neighborhoods.  Indeed, the entire city.  </p>
<p>THEY destroyed OUR city, and many lives with it.  </p>
<p>Detroit is not special - well, as my home, it was special to me, but what I mean is they will do the same everywhere they can.  Your home is not exempt.  The genocide of whites is not limited to Detroit, it&rsquo;s just a little further along there.  </p>

		<p>Oh yes, Devil&rsquo;s Night in Detroit (October 30).  During Devil&rsquo;s Night and Halloween, Dad used to sit with his .357 Magnum ready to go, just in case.  We only lived a few blocks north of Eight Mile  &mdash;  and the Detroit city limits.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s surprising is that there&rsquo;s anything left to burn.</p>
<p>I remember a long time ago, before this Angel&rsquo;s Night thing got started, there used to be over 500 fires in Detroit.  </p>

		<p>As some have directly remarked, it isn&rsquo;t that the black residents are so much not trying to burn down the buildings that are left, it&rsquo;s more the case that fewer are left to burn down. In the same way so goes crime in general in Detroit; that is, the crime rate has flattened out or fallen of late, but that&rsquo;s mostly because there isn&rsquo;t much left to steal, fewer whites to rape or kill, etc. In short, it isn&rsquo;t that Detroit is a better place to live it&rsquo;s that it is largely devoid of burnable, rapeable, killable, etc. targets of opportunity.<br>
Also, and as pointed out, what whites built has and is being burnt, robbed, and just plain killed by those that &#8220;would not be named&#8221; (e.g., &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo; blacks living in &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; nirvana that is now America). In addition, we have other cities where not just blacks destroy what whitey built, but now hoards of those &#8220;hard working, family oriented&#8221; hispanics we all have heard such good things about. Yep, they overload the hospitals, apply for benefits, demand benefits, march around with Mexican flags, etc. Yeah, just what we needed, another violent underclass to destroy and degrade what whitey built. Sure, Los Angeles is clearly now firmly in the rapture of its own &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; state of bliss where even one underclass slowly but surely wipes the other out to earn the right to destroy what whitey built (e.g., Mexicans killing blacks). Yes, we are just swimming in a kind of diverse mayhem that just boggles the mind.<br>
Hey, you know what, I don&rsquo;t remember voting on Detroit&rsquo;s demise or Los Angeles&rsquo; transformation, do you? Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been more polite, one could even say &rsquo;white&rsquo;, to have asked the people and/or their descendants who built Detroit or any number of other cities in America if they would like to be replaced by people who don&rsquo;t just destroy the physical infrastructure but additionally call us &lsquo;racist&rsquo; all the while demanding we subsidize their very existence as they rob and kill us? Anyways, just a thought as we watch each city turn into a third world hell hole that matches the people who live there and wander among the buildings they had little or no hand in creating; and, yes, in some cases burning them down just for the heck of it.<br>

		<p>My family has lived in this area of North America for over four hundred years and were among those that founded the trade posts that later became Fort Detroit and then the city of Detroit.  My family is European, mostly French.  Over the years however, my family befriended and intermarried with the local indians.  After all that history we are done.  We have all left Detroit for sure, and mostly Michigan for the freedom of the South.  </p>
<p>As I look over the picture albums, the reunion books, I feel very sad to say we all left everything behind, quite literally ran for our lives.  My parents told me of old Detroit, long after we left.  Since I was too young when we left I never knew the fantastic Thanksgiving Day parades, the summers at Belle Isle or shopping at Hudsons.  But what I do know and what my children are learning is the great devastation that comes to a people who forget their customs and culture, are too socialistic to defend their race or too cowardly to turn out those beasts among us.  </p>
<p>It has been said many times that if one wants to understand the future that awaits this country one only needs to go to Detroit.</p>

		<p>Just further proof that blacks blight anything they touch. This halloween I noticed all of the blacks who lived in the projects across the street going into our neighborhood to get candy from Whitey. I wouldn&rsquo;t give them anything. Just emblemmatic of the fact that blacks love to take from us, but then won&rsquo;t contribute anything in return.  Just tell me how these project people who get food stamps, low cost housing, and AFDC can&rsquo;t afford a single lousy bag of halloween candy to give out? Anyway, my real point is that Detroit is just a symbol of what&rsquo;s to come, until we stand up for ourselves, or just form our own homeland.</p>

		<p>If I were a billionaire, I would arrange free bus rides to Massachusetts for all of the residents who still remain in this war-torn, third world city. Those good liberals in Kennedy Land will know how to make everything nicey-nicey for those Motor City refugees.</p>

		<p>#14  That has already happened in a way.  Houston was all gracious and took in refugees from NO just after Katrina.  What they got was an instant crime wave and a city that is not fit to live in any more.  Thank God either by design or dumb luck Florida didn&rsquo;t do the same.  We instead emptied out of the state the police, fire, and ems to Al and Ms, people that were appreciative and fine folks.  The guys that I knew from our state LE force that went to NO said never again.  Some told me that it was worse than Iraq.</p>
