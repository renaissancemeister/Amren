<h1>NC Students Protest Racist Graffiti In Tunnel</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlotte Observer, November 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A reappearance of racist graffiti directed at President Barack Obama has protesters at North Carolina State University calling for changes to a part of campus dedicated to anything-goes speech.</p>
<p>Student protesters blocked access overnight to the Free Expression Tunnel, a major pedestrian thoroughfare that connects two parts of the Raleigh campus divided by railroad tracks. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Free Expression Tunnel was built in 1939, and was dedicated to freewheeling student speech in the 1960s. Sentiments painted or posted in the tunnel commonly range from the political to the mundane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students are free to say whatever they like, and if you walk through the tunnel on any given day you&rsquo;ll see advertisements for events, or you&rsquo;ll see someone complaining about a boyfriend or girlfriend,&#8221; Nichols said.</p>
<p>The several dozen student protesters, though, say they want tighter restrictions on what can be depicted inside the tunnel.</p>
<p>Some of the proposed remedies include more surveillance cameras around the tunnel and stricter enforcement of a request, posted on a sign near the tunnel, that asks students to refrain from offensive messages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two years ago, an NC State student who was never identified by the school apologized for spray painting racist, anti-Obama graffiti in the tunnel, shortly after the Democrat became the first black president in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The student was assigned community service and diversity training, which angered some civil rights groups that had advocated expulsion over the incident.</p>
<p>The Rev. William Barber, head of the state NAACP chapter, said {snip} &#8220;Whoever would write something like that in the tunnel again, on an amazing university campus, reveals something deeply problematic.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} the school issued a statement saying the best response to the graffiti is a campus-wide discussion.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;Our challenge is allowing freedom of expression while encouraging a constructive, open and diverse campus climate.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;freedom of expression while encouraging a constructive, open and diverse campus climate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Free expression and diversity? From a campus with a black and latino student center and countless, endless, racial special interest groups supported or associated or even a part of the campus, and yet not one single organization of any kind dedicated to white expression? Doesn&rsquo;t sound like diversity to me but conformity. I bet the free and open speech there isn&rsquo;t about tolerance but intolerance. No white interest groups on campus there to discuss diversity and tolerance? Or even what goes with them, affirmative action or rather &#8216;different standards, not double standards&rsquo; or more commonly &#8216;a commitment to excellence&rsquo;. Non-white special interest groups invited to speak openly (and indeed covered by the campus newspaper and eventually an agenda becoming part of the curriculum) forming the diversity agenda, yet no representation whatsoever for white groups. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a campus environment dedicated to ending racism but to being racist. </p>

		<p>I have noticed how the articles that are about &#8220;racist graffiti&#8221; or other &#8220;racial intimidation&#8221; never say what was written? I would imagine that it was only that they didnt agree with Obama policies or something similar. Its even possible that black kids wrote the graffiti themselves, took pictures and turned them in saying they were traumatized. I would imagine that if and when the cameras are installed (at great expense) no further &#8220;racist&#8221; writings will be found. </p>

		<p>I noticed that the article didn&rsquo;t bother to say what those &#8220;racist&#8221; graffiti paintings were.</p>
<p>Were the paintings of Obama with a Hitler mustache?</p>
<p>Do a search on google images for &#8220;george w. bush hitler&#8221; and you will see a lot of photoshopped images depicting Bush as Hitler.</p>
<p>So why is it only racist when people make fun of Obama?</p>

		<p>To liberals free speech means &#8220;speech that agrees with us&#8221;.  As you have probably noticed, liberals do not like to see the expression of opposing viewpoints.  In liberals&rsquo; minds this is hate speech.  Therefore, close down the tunnel to solve the dilemma&hellip;..that certainly will put an end to hate speech&hellip;..until someone starts spraying &#8220;hate graffiti&#8221; on the outside of the tunnel, or next to it, or somewhere.</p>
<p>There is an old fashioned method to handling expressions one considers offensive - don&rsquo;t look at it, don&rsquo;t listen to it, ignore it.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;Free Expression&#8221; Tunnel is eerily similar to The &#8220;Democracy Wall&#8221; in Beijing, some 30 years ago. People in China eventually posted so many pro-democracy slogans on the wall, that the Chinese regime eventually ruled that only those people who first REGISTERED WITH COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS, could be allowed to post.</p>
<p>Same thing with this university. When students start deciding who can say what and when, then that&rsquo;s worse than repression from the university administration.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that something in the book &#8220;1984&#8221; by Orwell, that cameras were everywhere to monitor for thought crimes?  Ironic that it is the liberals who call for these things out of one side of their mouth, but then want the privilege of secrecy for teenage abortions, their prolific drug use, their internet hook up planning and other items of debauchery.</p>

<p>Hmmm, no examples of some of the more extreme left-wing comments posted in the tunnel over the years are given here. My guess is that they included anti-Vietnam sentiments, anti-American sentiments, anti-flag sentiments, anti-Christian sentiments, anti-male sentiments and anti-white sentiments. But the moment someone posts some anti-Obama sentiments, then suddenly &#8220;free expression&#8221; no longer applies. Sounds pretty typical for the left.</p>

<p>I doubt there were several dozen. One likely made an issue of it and his friends took up the cause; &#8220;Fight the power, man!&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;Tighter restrictions&#8221; on &#8220;free speech&#8221;. Liberal double-speak oxymoron.</p>

<p>Try as they might they&rsquo;re fighting a losing battle by attempting to control thinking.</p>
<p>Blacks would be amazed at what whites say in private.  If they knew, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so arrogant.</p>
<p>Not many people think they&rsquo;re qualified for education beyond high school, or should I say beyond grade school, because tests reveal that most black high school seniors read and do math on about the eighth grade level.</p>

		<p> Put aside the FACT that most of these incidents are created by the very people who are supposedly being threatened by the &#8216;offensive&rsquo; speech.<br>
   What kind of lessons are these young minds being taught by deciding that certain types of free speech WILL NOT be tolerated? </p>

		<p>I think a lesson needs to be taught and not the one people think.  Make the &#8216;FET&rsquo; something like a facebook posting wall where painting the wrong things is not allowed.  Put the cameras on the tunnel as initially stated (the armored enclosure for which will cost more than the &#8216;any security store in a major mall&rsquo; CCD will).</p>
<p>And then create a second area where anything that might be deemed offensives can be said or shown with the only restriction being that, after a suitable period, it can be oversprayed, using a signature date basis of open controls.</p>
<p>No cameras.  No repurcussions at all.</p>
<p>Now watch which one turns into some lame, &#8216;art class and the campus paper&rsquo; venue, first.</p>
<p>Free speech thrives on being _unexpected_ rather than offensive.  But freedom is something that the responsible guard the availability of by expressing it with conservatism and discretion.  While protecting it with all their blood and soul.</p>
<p>There is real meaning in that old saw: &#8220;I will fight to the death for you to say it.&#8221;  What is less well known is the corelate: &#8220;Just don&rsquo;t expect me to read it when we&rsquo;re done.&#8221;</p>
<p>If there is a crime here, it lies with punishing the boy who wrote the first message, setting a precedent which the intuitive social rebel in a college environment will feel a need to rebalance or &#8216;get away with&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A second error was made in slamming him and us with an assumption of guilt without proper evidentiary proof.</p>
<p>Which is essentially the same lesson, in reverse, that the campus admins need to &#8216;cried wolf&rsquo; learn:  If it&rsquo;s worth complaining about, it&rsquo;s worth making an issue of.  Anything less is just an excuse for political bullying.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see, they call it Free Expression Tunnel and yet have a sign near it that &#8220;requests&#8221; students to refrain from writing &#8220;offensive messages,&#8221; and they somehow enforce this so-called request and now want stricter enforcement. Already at least one person has exercised his freedom of speech and been caught and assigned community service and diversity training. </p>
<p>Dear North Carolina State University: </p>
<p>Why not be honest and change the name of the Free Expression Tunnel to the You&rsquo;d Better Watch What You Say Tunnel? <br>

		<p>I live in Raleigh, and I&rsquo;ve searched the local media trying to figure out exactly what was written. The closest thing to a description was on WRAL, which said it was a &#8220;sexual gesture&#8221; and a picture of Obama. As near as I can figure out, that means a raised middle finger and a pic of the POTUS. </p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s racist about saying, essentially, &#8220;F&hellip; Obama?&#8221; Is it hate speech to say anything negative about anyone with brown skin? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Surveillance cameras proposed to curb &ldquo;racism&rdquo; in &ldquo;Free Expression Tunnel.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>So, basically the left wants to control us by making us afraid. The fear is already there. They don&rsquo;t need to frame it or explain it. All they need to do is rail against &#8216;hate&rsquo;. Or propose a camera to curb &#8216;racism&rsquo;. Sounds to me like they already know the word &#8216;hate&rsquo; (even despite the sorely misprosecuted hate crime statistics that Still show non-whites are more likely to hate) means whites. And that &#8216;racism&rsquo; means whites. And apparently we should be deathly afraid of being known as a racist or someone that hates. Sounds to me like &#8216;hate&rsquo; and &#8216;racism&rsquo; stands for whites with no explanation needed. We&rsquo;re supposed to not noticed that hate and racism placed on only one race is not hate and racism itself?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite interesting that the left always seems to control the word &#8216;fear&rsquo; too. The perception is that it is always whites and the right who use &#8216;fear&rsquo;. And conversely that when whites Are afraid, this is a bad thing and shows badly on those who are afraid. When non-whites were &#8216;afraid&rsquo; the whole country had to mobilize to combat this shameful &#8216;reality&rsquo;. <br>

I think for most of them (and it&rsquo;s understandable that most knuckle under to their side) I think for most of them fear itself has become the main goal. It&rsquo;s not a main grab for direct power as much as a grab for the grounds from which to most easily intimidate others. Making people afraid to oppose them or their positions have become job one. Most times they may not even be conscious of it.  <br>

<p>More and more forums on line, especially US newspapers, are starting to do this as well, demanding that posters first give their addresses, phone numbers and other forms of ID that the newspaper then verifies.</p>

		<p><i>Editorial boards have fallen under sway of the beliefs students have these days, like the ones graduating from this university with the free expression tunnel?</i></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got it exactly backwards.</p>
<p>Editorial boards, especially those that rule the big papers (NY Slime por exemplo) drive the powerful leftist agenda in this country.  Before the Internet, such vile newspapers were <i>the</i> arbiters of political discourse because <i>there was nothing else</i></p>
<p>Academia and universities such as the NCSU are working in cahoots with <i>both</i>political parties to destroy this country by promoting unfettered third world immigration, Bantu refugee settlement programs, &#8220;stimulus&#8221; or &#8220;bailouts&#8221; via fake currency, massive deficit spending, and treasury-draining proxy wars in the Middle East.  </p>
<p>Krugman the Keynesian is God according to these editorial boards and they will back him even though his &#8220;advice&#8221; is causing the US economy to implode.  What does he care?  His bags are packed and his money is safely secured off shore or abroad.  He plans to &#8220;bailout&#8221; himself, probably when hype-inflation hits.</p>
<p>All of it is designed to destroy the enemy, his homeland and his economy; that is, US whites, and implement a tyrannical one world government. White private property will be confiscated and whites themselves deemed as excess population  hunted down and killed.</p>

		<p>Whenever whites, as individuals or small groups, speak out to defend themselves the anti-white racists bring all their power to bear on that small act of free expression.  In this way whites trying to defend themselves are silenced.</p>
<p>If all whites who are concerned about the massive racism whites are subjected spoke out at the same time there is nothing the  racists could do to stop it.  There are too many whites to silence them.</p>
<p>Toward that end I&rsquo;m suggesting that all whites start speaking out at the same time on a regular basis. </p>
<p>The 15th of every month is White Defense Day.  On that day, every month, speak out against anti-white racism.  This will build up a movement which will snowball and create a climate where whites can exercise their freedom of speech without fear.  This will happen because whites are all acting at the same time.</p>
