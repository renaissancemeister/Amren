			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Paul Kuhn, Real Clear Politics, November 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democrats performed worse with whites on Tuesday than in any other congressional election since the Second World War.</p>
<p>Democrats&rsquo; white problems stretch back nearly a half-century{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans won whites in Tuesday&rsquo;s national House vote by a 22-percentage point margin (60 to 38 percent) according to exit polls. In 2006, Republicans won whites by a mere 4 points. Whites shifted at three-fold the rate of Hispanics between the two midterms, while the black vote remained steady. Democrats faired even worse than in 1994, when Republicans won whites by 16 points (58 to 42 percent) and with them, a landslide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In this vein, Democrats&rsquo; problems with whites reflect whites&rsquo; problems with Obama. Whites&rsquo; support for Democrats in 2010 roughly matches the president&rsquo;s standing prior to the September 2008 crash. Before the crash, Obama polled like earlier Democratic nominees with whites. After the crash, Obama earned the support of more white men than any other Democrat since 1976. He also improved with white women, winning a traditional share for Democrats.</p>
<p>Those gains are gone. Obama&rsquo;s approval rating with whites has declined from the low 60s (week one) to the high 30s (this week).</p>
<p>We will hear charges of racism. But independent whites who voted for Obama have not suddenly realized he&rsquo;s black. Many independents were willing to gamble on Democrats. {snip}</p>
<p>The recession was the dominant factor for voters this year. But the recession cannot be separated from Obama&rsquo;s agenda. {snip} Obama&rsquo;s priorities were not the majority&rsquo;s priorities, especially not whites. Most whites have favored a smaller government over a bigger government for decades. Obama&rsquo;s agenda heralded the return of big government, or active-state liberalism. He gave the boldest liberal push since the Great Society.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The past has caught up. Democrats chose legislation on healthcare and climate change over major jobs initiatives. {snip} By the time Democrats tried to move to jobs, whites had already moved on. {snip}</p>
<p>Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s domestic programs lost whites support in polls by 1966, and with them the majority. Obama has proceeded like Johnson and received a like rebuke. Only about a third of white men and white women approved of Obama&rsquo;s signature domestic legislation, healthcare, at the time of its passage. Whites similarly opposed the stimulus. It&rsquo;s no accident that over the summer of 2009, when healthcare dominated the debate, Obama first lost the majority of whites and independents.</p>
<p>The keyword is &#8220;lost.&#8221; Voters equally disapprove of both parties. Democrats lost whites. Republicans did not win them. This election was not a vote for Republicans anymore than 2006 was a vote for Democrats. We just witnessed an historic no confidence vote.</p>
<p>Those lost are not simply &#8220;soccer moms&#8221; or &#8220;NASCAR dads.&#8221; Only 35 percent of white men voted for Democrats compared to 40 percent of white women. That marks a 9-point Democratic loss with both blocs since 2006. Democrats performed especially poorly with white women compared to past House elections  &mdash;  6 points worse than in 1994. In post-war congressional elections, 2010 signifies Democrats&rsquo; worst showing with white women and the floor of Democrats&rsquo; standing with white men.</p>
<p>Democrats also performed slightly worse with white independents than in any House contest since at least the Reagan era. Same story with college and non-college educated whites, as well as white seniors. {snip}</p>
<p>This was broad white flight. And it crossed a symbolic threshold. Among whites, for the first time in post-war congressional elections, Republicans hit the 60-point level of support and Democrats fell below the 40-point mark.</p>
<p>Obama will not easily win these voters back. Whites constitute a smaller share of the electorate than in decades past. And their influence is greater in midterms than White House contests. {snip}</p>

		<p>This time of year every other year is like heaven for a political statgeek like me, i.e. the type of person who has been lovingly accused of having an encyclopedic memory of election results, such that I could tell you about Senate elections in New Hampshire from 1932.  But I digress.  Too, it has not translated into a job offer from a major network, though I hear a position at NPR is open   &mdash;   Though they say I have to check both my opinions and my manhood in at the door before working THAT job.</p>
<p>What jumped out at me are the numbers 35 and 40.  White men gave 35% of their votes to Democrats, white women gave 40% of their votes to Democrats.  The reason those stats jump out at me is that while there was again a gender gap, the white gender gap is lower than any time in my conscious lifetime of statgeekery.  Gallup figured a 9 point overall gender gap between men and women of all races, but I said on my blog the day before the election that I predicted the white gender gap wouldn&rsquo;t be that big, and my evidence was the predominance of white women in the Tea Party Movement.</p>
<p>Cha-ching.</p>

<p>Oh, I think that this might be more than symbolic, since it shows the largest group racial solidarity that white voters in the USA have shown ever. The elections in the 1940s through 1990s with large white majorities supporting either party, are not as significant as this for two reasons. First, the country was, during those decades overwhelmingly white by 89% to 75%; and second, multiculturalism was not the established sociopolitical norm during those periods either. Today, we are but 65% of the population and as we all know and as is dictated from &ldquo;on high,&rdquo; diversity is our strength.</p>
<p>This is as dramatic a shift for whites as a group, as we race realist could ever hope for. Moreover, should the Republicans realize this, or a strong third party emerge in response to the expected Republican incomprehension of this, we will have won a major battle in securing the future of our race on this continent. The multicultural monolith might very well be collapsing before our very eyes, in other words.</p>
<p>I say, may God let it be so!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Republicans won the white vote 60 to 38 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disturbing to me that there are 38% of whites within the electorate in this country who are so dimwitted and/or brainwashed they STILL voted for the Democrats, in spite of a wealth of evidence revealing them to be disinterested in white rights, traditions, or culture.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really sickening to note that there are so many whites who have their heads where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine.</p>

		<p>These number&rsquo;s sound good and they are a start in the right direction. But the real test will come in 2012. With The Messiah at the top of the ticket the Republican candidate will probably have to attract at least 65% of the total White Vote in order to win. This I think will be a tall order because I am afraid that too many Whites will feel guilty and racist if they vote against The One, and the black&rsquo;s and other people of color will come out to vote in droves.</p>

		<p>These numbers are not really comforting.  The Democrats shouldn&rsquo;t be getting any more than 10-15% (the nut vote) of the white vote.  It&rsquo;s as insane for a white to vote Democratic as it would have been for a Jew or Pole to vote for Hitler (had they been given the chance) not in 1933 when it might have been possible to construct some plausible reason for doing so, but in 1944 after they knew what he was about.   Read the insane screed by Tim Wise, a &#8220;respected anti-racism activist&#8221; whom Liberalism makes sure is supported with plenty of tax payer money.  Read the supporting comments among the Kos members.    Liberalism is American Nazism, white people are its victims, and the Democratic Party is its political front. </p>

<p>I feel like a bull chasing a cape to be honest.  I just don&rsquo;t want it to end up an abatoir chute of constricting options later on.  No agenda beyond &#8216;whoohoo, ain&rsquo;t we great!&rsquo; is not what I was hoping to hear.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>We are optimally positioned with a relatively small population in a world of declining resources amidst giants of overpopulation who choke their own economic growth in Asia and Africa and elsewhere.  Unfortunately, we have been put in a position where, to compete with the mass-birth demographics of an influx of non-whites, we are being asked to re-energize a population epidemic that we no longer have the economy to afford.  Why SHOULD white children be loyal to white ideals if the nation we hand them the keys to is one of &#8216;up or out&rsquo; a demographic population war with only the slenderest of job quality and standard of living advantages, even if they &#8216;win&rsquo;? </p>
<p><br>
Having said all that, let me state that I think that, tactically, it is time to thoroughly shame Obama&rsquo;s healthcare putsch so that, in a nation wide &#8216;group hug&rsquo; of communal accomplishment, we can trade &#8216;guilt at decrying The Not So Great One&rsquo; for a profound brow-wipe of relief at not catapulting ourselves into the really deep end of debt.</p>
<p>To do so will forever put us on the bad side of our ethnic opposites who will see this as whites-the-enemy-forever! trying to make them feel useless in their one chance at the spotlight.</p>
<p>But frankly, that may also not be such a bad &#8216;one side or the other&rsquo; fence check choice to enforce.</p>
<p>I think things are about to get so horrendous, economically, that four years of tomfoolery as &#8216;non-racist racialism&rsquo; will seem like small potatoes, if we survive.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Obama campaigns again if he will be able to continue to dodge the citizenship/birth certificate/passport issues with offhand remarks about having &#8220;dealt with all of that four years ago,&#8221; &#8220;it&rsquo;s all explained on my website,&#8221; etc.  The McCain campaign never demanded that Obama release his records, but the next Republican candidate might actually want to win the election.  Since the people who will accuse the Republicans of racism won&rsquo;t vote for a Republican anyway, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much to lose.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Obama can be re-elected without massive voter fraud.  There is no way that the jobless figures will improve much in the next two years, and the housing crisis will not be over by then either.  Blacks and Hispanics will not turn out to vote in record numbers when Obama hasn&rsquo;t actually done anything to provide more or better jobs for those groups.  </p>

<p>These numbers mean that, if voting were still limited to white men, we would be living in a far more conservative country.  Not that I&rsquo;m suggesting anything, just noting one possible explanation to account for the massive liberalization which has enveloped our county these past decades.</p>

Whites have done their pennance. Most will not respond to the guilt thing anymore. It was a novelty. The real danger is in what presidents often do: manufacture or capitalize on some form of disaster or fake threat. Or, if the economy is on the rise. There&rsquo;s where whites are REALLY spineless and stupid. They&rsquo;ll mortgage their children&rsquo;s future for four more years of delusion.</p>

		<p>Let us remember that Arabs in this country are counted as whites, the same for some other West-Asian peoples. The muddle the statistics. Imagine if just Northern-European whites were counted how lopsided their voting preferences would turn out to be. Propabably around 70% in favor of the GOP (who don&rsquo;t deserve it, but that&rsquo;s another story).</p>

		<p>The Democrats have been anti-white for decades.  The last time they cared about the white working class was in the fifties.  So it&rsquo;s a good thing that more whites are finally waking up.  The problem is that all the Republicans care about are tax cuts when the federal deficit is $4 billion a day, and fighting endless and increasingly pointless wars.  They will not cut spending in any significant way, which of necessity would include stopping the wars and closing overseas military bases.  They won&rsquo;t cut immigration (big business is now thoroughly addicted to replacing expensive American workers with cheap third would labor) and they won&rsquo;t get rid of affirmative action and the numerous racial set asides in our government.  They won&rsquo;t get rid of unconstitutional laws like the Patriot Act.  They are the useless opposition to the evil party.</p>

		<p>Ethnocentric voting is the most natural kind and, really, it is inevitable. Blacks, browns and all else vote along ethnocentric lines. What is surprising is that this is surprising. Who could possibly hope to hang onto white self-abasement as a major force? Only those with a huge and uncritical belief in the persuasive power of disinformation, namely people in the mainstream media. Those media figures have been shaming, blaming and catcalling white people for years, and they expect no reaction?</p>
