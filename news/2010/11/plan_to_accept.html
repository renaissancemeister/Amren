<h1><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7778771">Plan to Accept Mexican ID Draws Fire</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tamara Gibbs, WTVD-TV (Raleigh-Durham), Nov. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Durham&rsquo;s city council is getting an earful over a controversial plan to allow Mexican immigrants to use a special Mexican ID card for Mexican citizens living outside Mexico. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The [Matricula Consular] card is accepted as ID by many police departments nationwide, and many banks accept it for financial transactions.</p>
<p>According to an opinion from the Durham City Attorney, &#8220;the official purpose of the card is to demonstrate that the holder is a Mexican citizen living outside of Mexico. It includes an official Government of Mexico issued ID number and bears a photograph and address of the Mexican National to whom it is issued.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Durham approves the resolution, city officials would accept it as a legal form of ID for business conducted with the city. Police officers would also accept it for identification purposes.</p>
<p>But some see the plan as an endorsement of undocumented workers, while others say it will save time and taxpayer money.</p>
<p>Mexican advocacy groups like El Centro Hispano in Durham are pushing for the idea. But since word of the plan went public, city council members have found their mailboxes stuffed with messages from people who hate the proposal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mitch Kokai with the John Locke Foundation says he fears the ID card has been oversold as a valid form of identification.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And, that&rsquo;s just one problem, according to critics. They also say the card could be a roundabout way for undocumented workers to vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;That could be the path that leads from this card to the official document  &mdash;  to being able to vote  &mdash;  and I think for voter integrity that&rsquo;s a concern a lot of folks should have,&#8221; said Kokai.</p>
<p>City council members have less than a week to consider feedback from both sides of the debate. They&rsquo;ll vote on the controversial issue November 15.</p>

		<p>Who&rsquo;s monitoring the Mexican Embassies ensuring that one illegal isn&rsquo;t issued MORE than one ID card?  Who&rsquo;s monitoring the Mexican Embassies ensuring that the name on the card IS the one the illegal was born under, and not just another identity replacing the one under which he/she committed a crime?  Oh, right.  The Mexican Government is doing that.  THEY wouldn&rsquo;t defraud America.  Heaven forbid!  Completely trustworthy, they are.  Silly me for asking.  Short answer?  NO.  NOT accepted for ANY legal business or services here in the US.  Period.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna bet the council votes how they want and will not GAF  what the voters want them to do. I live in South Carolina so since the traitor Lindsey Graham is still in office I suspect this vote of theirs will have some affect on S.C.</p>

		<p>The &#8216;troubled economic times&rsquo; are just one more convenient reason for local governments to prostitute themselves for another five cents from any source.<br>
They can add that to their &#8216;it will make it easier to keep track of them&rsquo; drivel.</p>

		<p>Legal immigrants in the U. S. already have the documents they need.  The purpose of the Mexican matricula consular cards is to make life easier for illegal aliens. Moreover, the FBI claims the supporting documents for the matricula are easily forged.</p>
<p>Highlights below of a 2005 report on the matriculas also provide insight on how the federal government engineered the subprime mortgage crisis: </p>
<p>&#8220;Controversy roils over Mexican ID&#8221; <br>
North County (CA) Times<br>

<p>HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE ARTICLE: </p>
<p>HOW THE MEXICAN ILLEGAL ALIEN ID CARD, THE MATRICA CONSULAR, SUBVERTS IMMIGRATION LAW AND FOSTERS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: </p>
<p>&ldquo;A glossy brochure handed out at the Mexican Consulate in San Diego promises Mexicans that having one of the cards &lsquo;can make your dreams come true,&rsquo; allow Mexican citizens to open bank accounts, get credit cards and even &lsquo;own the home of (their) dreams.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
<p>ADDITIONAL USE FOR THE MATRICULA CONSULAR: CHEAP WIRE TRANSFERS TO MEXICO: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Bank accounts give immigrants more than just a safe place to keep their money, however. They are a first step toward establishing credit. They also provide access to other bank services, such as inexpensive wire transfers that allow immigrants to send money to their families in Mexico.&rdquo; </p>
<p>U. S. BANKS QUICK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS NEW &ldquo;MARKET&rdquo; FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mexican Embassy reported in 2004 that the matricula consular was accepted as valid identification by 178 financial institutions in the United States, and 1,180 police departments, according to a report issued earlier this year by the Congressional Research Service.&rdquo; </p>
<p>REASON FOR EXPANSION OF MARTICULA CONSULAR USE IN U.S: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Starting in 2003, a change in U.S. Treasury rules allowed banks and other financial institutions to accept matricula cards as valid identification to open accounts.&rdquo; </p>
<p>FBI PANS MATRICULA CONSULAR, CLAIMS SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS EASILY FORGED: </p>
<p>&#8220;&rsquo;The Department of Justice and the FBI have concluded that the matricula consular is not a reliable form of identification, due to the nonexistence of any means of verifying the true identity of the cardholder,&rsquo; said Steve McCraw, assistant director of the FBI&rsquo;s Office of Intelligence, testifying before Congress in 2003.<br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;The government of Mexico issues the card to anyone who can produce a Mexican birth certificate and one other form of identity, including documents of very low reliability. Mexican birth certificates are easy to forge,&rsquo; McCraw said.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>They have multiple ID counterfeiting rings going on in this city, some of them brazenly open. It appears to be that hispanic syndicates control them. If American documents can be professionally counterfeited then so can the matricula consular card. How would anyone here be able to distinguish between a genuine and a fake consular card. And even if it was really issued by the Mexican government I wouldn&rsquo;t trust it as the government itself is crooked to the core. The card should send up the red flag, saying illegal alien, and the INS should move in. How about doing that instead of just accepting them like a bunch of wimps? </p>

		<p>No surprise. After all, Durham is the city where Mike Nifong was elected District Attorney after bringing trumped-up rape charges against the Duke Lacrosse team.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the home of the false accuser Crystal Mangum.   </p>

		<p>Anything they can do to tear down the notion of separate nations for separate peoples&hellip;</p>
<p>Indeed, the worst possible thing would be for these people to -acknowledge- that this is a very vulnerable form of ID.  Because that would encourage the next step: RFID and &#8216;common database&rsquo; enforcement authenticated address and personal (biometric) data.  As soon as you have shared law enforcement and tax identity access to two populations, the next step is to &#8216;reduce abuse and increase oversight&rsquo; by a corrupt Mexican government by merging the monitoring services together.</p>
<p>Indeed, _merging countries_ is what this is about and the functional act of doing so ALWAYS begins in the bureaucracy of civil administration.  Not the economics.  Which we now know is a disaster for the U.S. in terms of depressing wages and failing to create jobs for the massive numbers of unemployed.</p>
<p>Which is why Amnesty scares me.</p>
<p>Because (by birth rate) it&rsquo;s clearly not intended to stop there as a massive (and young, breeding younger) Hispanic population in the U.S. by 2050-2070 could form a referendum sufficient to endorse combining both countries, even over the objections of the white indigenes.</p>
<p>Hence the notion that &#8216;Democrats are doing this for votes&rsquo; is invalid.  It&rsquo;s all amalgamistic.  From small city states (Europe as EU) to large (America/Canada/Mexico = NAU), someone clearly wants to push for dissolving national identities on the road to supranationalist OWG.</p>
<p>And anyone who is in the existing federal government with access to accurate demography predictions _has to see_ what&rsquo;s coming, as the end of their own job positions.</p>
<p>And be going along with it anyway.</p>
<p>While the rest of us poor dumb schmucks are simply left in the dark as to _WHY?_.  What good does it do for U.S. as opposed to the ROW?</p>
<p>There is no answer to that.  Because it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>If they want to encourage/legitimize ILLEGAL ALIENS, then we start a boycott of Durham as a vacation/school/business destination.</p>
<p>WHen there is no money for illegals and their drain on the economy, and the citizens of Durham see what it CO$T$ them to encourage traitorous activities, I think they&rsquo;ll change their tune, from a mariachi to a Sousa marching band.</p>
