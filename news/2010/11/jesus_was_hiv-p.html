			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail Reporter, November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A South African pastor has provoked outrage after beginning a recent sermon with the claim that Jesus Christ was HIV-positive.</p>
<p>Xola Skosana stunned his congregation in Cape Town&rsquo;s Khayelitsha township with the bold statement, news of which then quickly spread across the country.</p>
<p>And Christians have reacted angrily, claiming it portrays Jesus as sexually promiscuous.</p>
<p>&#8216;The subject of my Jesus being HIV-positive is a scathing matter,&rsquo; said another local pastor, Mike Bele.</p>
<p>&#8216;I believe no anointed leader with a sound mind about the scriptures and the role of Christ in our lives would deliberately drag the name of Christ to the ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pastor Skosana, whose non-denominational Hope for Life Ministry is part of a growing charismatic movement in South Africa, insists his message is more about giving hope than anything else.</p>
<p>By making the claim, he hopes to remove the stigma attached to HIV suffers in his country.</p>
<p>More than 5.7million people live with the virus in South Africa  &mdash;  more than in any other country. Pastor Skosana himself lost two sisters to Aids.</p>
<p>HIV is predominantly transmitted through sex but can also be spread by the transfer of contaminated blood into the system through needle-sharing.</p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding can also be a cause.</p>
<p>&#8216;Wherever you open the scriptures Jesus puts himself in the shoes of people who experience brokenness,&rsquo; the Pastor told the BBC. &#8216;Isaiah 53, for example, clearly paints a picture of Jesus who takes upon himself the infirmities and the brokenness of humanity.</p>
<p>&#8216;Of course, there&rsquo;s no scientific evidence that Jesus had the HI virus in his bloodstream. The best gift we can give to people who are HIV-positive is to help de-stigmatise Aids and create an environment where they know God is not against them, he&rsquo;s not ashamed of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To conclude his sermon, he says: &#8216;The message to the church is that it is not enough for us to give people food privately and give them groceries, we must create an environment that&rsquo;s empowering because most people who are HIV-positive will not necessarily die of Aids-related sickness but more of a broken heart, out of rejection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite the angry reaction from some Christians others have come to the pastor&rsquo;s defence.</p>
<p>Pastor Skosana, whose non-denominational Hope For Life Ministry is part of a growing charismatic movement in South Africa, insists his message is more about giving hope than anything else</p>
<p>Pastor Skosana, whose non-denominational Hope For Life Ministry is part of a growing charismatic movement in South Africa, insists his message is more about giving hope than anything else</p>
<p>Reverend Siyabulela Gidi, the director of South African Council of Churches in the Western Cape, added: &#8216;What Pastor Skosana is clearly saying is that Christ at this point in time would be on the side of the people who are HIV-positive  &mdash;  people who are being sidelined by the very church that is attacking him.</p>
<p>&#8216;Pastor Skosana has fortunately got the country talking, he&rsquo;s got the world talking and that is what theology is all about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Aids activists have also given the sermon their backing.</p>
<p>&#8216;It takes away the stigma that HIV is a sin and that it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s punishment,&rsquo; said Vuyiseka Dubula, general secretary of the Treatment Action Campaign, a South African Aids activist group.</p>
<p>&#8216;To associate Jesus with HIV is powerful, particularly for those who go to church&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Pastor Xola Skosana is lucky that he did not make such an insult about the founder of Islam, Mohammed.</p>
<p>Christians will rightfully complain about this insult to their faith, but at least they will not call for a jihad and kill him.</p>
<p>If pastor Skosana made such an insulting claim that Moses was promiscuous and was HIV positive, Jews and the ADL would complain that he is anti-semitic, but would not go and kill him.  It is doubtful that even the JDL would be a threat to<br>
him.</p>
<p>Not so if he made such an insulting claim about Mohammed!  The Muslims would never tolerate such an insult to Islam.  Muslims in South Africa and elsewhere would go after him and kill such an &#8220;infidel&#8221;!</p>

<p>They make it sound like its okay to lie about the Son of God and Saviour of the World and commit blatent heresy, as long as it advances their liberal agenda.  To Hell with them, this is yet another example of how the whole televangelist/charismatic/New Age version of Christianity is simply an imposter, and can be quite dangerous - especially in the hands of simple-minded Third-Worlders.  In a better world, I wouldn&rsquo;t even have to explain why Jesus Christ could not have had HIV, but I&rsquo;m sure there are some out there in this insane mess of a planet who will believe anything.  HIV was first transmitted to humans in the nineteen-fifties, there&rsquo;s your scientific proof.  As for the religious proof - Jesus was morally perfect and therefore would not have engaged in pre-marital intercourse, especially not with another man (and that is how HIV is usually spread).</p>

		<p>I wonder what would happen if this same moron put Mohammed in a vial of urine or declare he was HIV positive?</p>
<p>Likewise I&rsquo;d like to hear this Joy Behar, Garafalo, Sarandin and other far left Hollywood kooks make the same degrading statements about Islam and Mohammed.</p>
<p>Bill Mahr rales about what he perceives as absurdities of the Christian religion, some of which are beliefs held also by Muslims.</p>
<p>But we will never hear Behar or Mahr utter the word Muslim in their denigration of religion.  I think the term that applies here is cowardice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think blacks just aren&rsquo;t smart enough for Christianity. Somehow, they always screw it up, get it wrong, amp it up, dumb it down, twist it beyond recognition. It seems like the subtleties and philsophies of white European Christianity are just lost on them. These higher things of Christian thinking fly right over their nappy heads   &mdash;   as instead they latch onto idiotic and/or lurid notions like Jesus being HIV+. </p>
<p>No, Pastor Skosana: just because an phenomenal fraction of your fellow Africans have gone and got themselves HIV/AIDS, and you see it around you all the time, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that Jesus had it, in a different part of the world, 2000 years ago. </p>
<p>Especially since HIV/AIDS weren&rsquo;t scheduled to make their appearance on earth for almost TWO MILLENNIA later. </p>
<p>Numbskull. </p>
<p>I would go so far as to say Africans don&rsquo;t deserve Christianity. And this is coming from an Atheist. <br>

<p>I see here the same mentality as the claim that &#8220;race is just a social construct:&#8221; the idea that merely claiming something, regardless of any facts or proof, makes it so. </p>
<p>How does making a silly, unfounded claim take away any social stigma? Likewise, how does claiming that  &#8220;race is just a social construct&#8221; make it so? </p>
<p>Is the belief that if enough people are shamed into believing something is a fact, that will make it reality? That if enough people pretend something is true, that will be good enough?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot like the effort to remove all &#8220;sexist&#8221; language from the Bible. Whether you believe the Bible is the word of God or just a historical document, it makes zero sense.</p>

		<p>If race is just a social construct then I am free to say that disease is also just a social construct.  Thus it does not matter whether Jesus had herpeghonosiphilaids or not and the statement isn&rsquo;t &#8220;powerful&#8221;; it&rsquo;s irrelevant (especially considering its source.)</p>

		<p>This is a good example of African thinking, as I have observed it in the U.S. Black men are very perceptive of their immediate environment. Often more so than the typical civilized white man is. On the other hand, when dealing with abstract information, with future possibilities, or matters outside their immediate experience, Blacks show a mixture of indifference and  credibility. If it sounds good, black men will agree, but don&rsquo;t expect them to act on the information.</p>

		<p>I doubt if many AMREN readers have visited South Africa and, if so, that none have accidentally wandered into Cape Town&rsquo;s Khayelitsha township, since you have to be very determined to visit as it it not exactly prominent on any map and is down a side road a very long way from anywhere else. Therefore it will come as no surprise to learn that it is totally, absolutely, completely, 100% inhabited by Black Africans. No, not the African-Americans you have under your tender welfare care in USA but real Black Africans with no fake &#8216;racial memories&rsquo; of slavery or equally fake &#8216;Pigford&rsquo; farming compensation claims. &#8216;Pastor&rsquo; Xola Skosana, just one of many thousands in the revenue gathering non-denominational but international Black charismatic movement &#8216;Hope for Life Ministry&rsquo; who also promote the idea that AIDS is a deliberate White plan to eliminate the Black race.  The Zulu President of South Africa takes a shower following unprotected extra-marital sex and publicly announces to the entire black populace that this prevents him from catching AIDS and, in any case, poverty and a poor diet as a direct result of the apartheid era is the cause, not any disease. So, to lay the blame for AIDS on Jesus Christ, who is always portrayed as White Caucasian and the first Christian to be killed by the Jews, this makes perfect sense. Inconsistent, stupid, ill-founded, yes, I know, but  don&rsquo;t shoot the messenger, I am only reporting what I have witnessed. A recent undercover report by UK T/V into Black African &#8216;child witches&rsquo; exposed the full involvement of evangelical black &#8216;churches&rsquo; in London, England, and the huge amounts of cash demanded by &#8216;ministers&rsquo; to &#8216;cure&rsquo; these poor unfortunate children but no black in England will complain to the authorities as these are, in the most part, White and the typical black mentality &#8216;don&rsquo;t snitch&rsquo; law applies just as it does to any black criminal activity. &#8220;To associate Jesus with HIV is powerful, particularly for those who go to church&#8221;.  So, in conclusion, my advice is to stay away from black churches.</p>

		<p>Because Jesus ate &amp; drank with sinners, a certain precentage of readers will always assume that He approved of, &amp; participated in, what they were doing   &mdash;   that the Lord partied, got drunk, slept with whores, etc.  Talking people out of such an ugly misconception means changing their entire moral view of the world. That used to be the job of priests &amp; nuns.  Don&rsquo;t ask me what priests &amp; nuns are doing these days, but it&rsquo;s obviously not educating anyone about what Jesus was all about.</p>

		<p>Whether Jesus had sex or not, whether he married the Magdalene or was celibate, or even a manwhore, is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>The thing is, HIV didn&rsquo;t appear until probably the 20th century; the last I saw, the first suspected case was reported in 1959.  It may have existed in Africa before that, but probably not for very long, at least not in humans.  It simply probably didn&rsquo;t exist in Jesus&rsquo; time (that pesky thing called Evolution, you know; new things CAN appear) &hellip;. </p>
<p>I blame the spread of HIV/AIDS on the Peace Corps.  You just don&rsquo;t send horny kids to countries where they think it&rsquo;s a good idea to provide whores with hotel rooms.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Whatsoever you do to the least of these, that you do to me.&#8221; </p>
<p>Jesus was not HIV positive, the virus didn&rsquo;t exist 2000 years ago. However, the pastor makes a valid point: if you mistreat people with HIV, you mistreat Jesus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame he wasn&rsquo;t capable of expressing himself more clearly; people get lost on debating the scientific accuracy of the nonsense statement, while missing the bigger point.</p>

		<p>I blame the spread of AIDS on African development in the 1960s.  High-capacity roads were built deep into the interior in order that lumber and the minerals then being found could be brought out.  Men at logging and mining camps - away from their families - visited local prostitutes, and the roads made it easy for a disease which might have remained quite isolated (wherever exactly it first reached humans) to reach centers of commerce.  From there, the spread would have been explosive.</p>

		<p>Blacks were never meant to be Christians in the first place. NO  nonwhite can identify with Christianity to begin with and will pervert it every chance they get. Most of you here will deny this is true, but it is true. </p>
<p> The same goes for Catholics in Mexico. It is more voodoo than Christianity. Thanks to the White missionaries who have gone throughout the 3rd world trying to &#8220;convert&#8221; these peoples and claiming the Bible tells them so and that the &#8220;world&#8221; means nonwhite peoples. We have seen the results of this misconception and other misconceptions in the Bible that has wrought ever White nation in the world, to become nothing but a multiracial nightmare, thanks to them bringing all these people into their nations. That alone is PROOF that Christianity was to be a White man&rsquo;s religion to begin with! </p>
<p> The churches and pastors have so brainwashed the sheeple in the pews this is what God wanted! We all have seen how much the Church has changed and caved into the PC notions so as not to offend. That alone is another reason why every White should be suspicious of what they have been told. The Bible has been so perverted and the meanings behind those verses have been tampered with and changed. What makes us think that the churches, seminaries and pastors haven&rsquo;t been hi-jacked and infiltrated, when every institution and government on earth has been infiltrated???  Think about it. </p>

		<p>It should be easy enough to check and see if Jesus was HIV positive. Once the priest has changed the wine into the blood of Christ then send it to a lab and have it tested. The last time they did this they discovered that Christ must have had a drinking problem because his blood had a very high alcohol level. </p>

		<p><i>I doubt if many AMREN readers have visited South Africa&hellip; </i></p>
<p>Actually, I have, back when apartheid was still in force. Yeah, SA sucked for blacks then. But the post-apartheid system sucks for Whites now (and for a lot of blacks who end up at the short end of the stick). Thing is, the struggle in South Africa was not about &#8220;majority rule&#8221; but about power, who was going to be the ruling elite: Whites or a Marxist-black coalition. The latter won out and we can see what happened. Meantime, Americans delude themselves into thinking the struggle was about democracy. </p>
<p>A point I keep harping on is that post-apartheid South Africa may be a snapshot of the future in countries where Whites surrender political power. Liberals promise a brave new world of equality and diversity, but the reality is increasingly dysfunctional and violent societies. Despite the utter failure of liberalism to provide the results it promises, liberals pile on the delusions.<br>

		<p>Someone may have made the point and I overlooked it; if so, I&rsquo;ll say it again:  the AIDS/HIV virus came into being, or at least mutated into a lethal strain, sometime around the 1970s or 1980s.  It wasn&rsquo;t around as such 2000 years ago.</p>
