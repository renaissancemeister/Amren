<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-latinamerica/20101112/LT.Mexico.US.Immigration/">Study: 100,000 Hispanics Left Arizona After SB1070</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study suggests there may be 100,000 fewer Hispanics in Arizona than there were before the debate over the state&rsquo;s tough new immigration law earlier this year.</p>
<p>BBVA Bancomer Research, which did the study, worked with figures from the U.S. Current Population Survey. The study says the decline could be due to the law known as SB1070, which partly entered into effect in July, or to Arizona&rsquo;s difficult economic situation.</p>
<p>The study released Wednesday also cites Mexican government figures as saying that 23,380 Mexicans returned from Arizona to Mexico between June and September.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In that and other studies released at the Global Forum on Migration and Development in the Pacific coast resort of Puerto Vallarta, BBVA Bancomer Research  &mdash;  part of the financial group of the same name  &mdash;  estimated that probably about 720,000 Mexican migrants were unemployed in the United States when the study concluded in late October.</p>

								<h2>Arizona Immigration Law Provoked Exodus of Hispanics: Study</h2>
						<p>
							<i>AFP, Nov. 11, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A controversial immigration law in Arizona has likely provoked the voluntary departure of 100,000 Hispanics from the southern US state, according to a study released Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several months after the law was applied, it&rsquo;s possible to observe a lower number of Hispanics in that area of America. We estimate there are 100,000 less Hispanics compared to the start of 2010,&#8221; said the report by the private BBVA Bancomer foundation, released at the two-day Global Forum on Migration and Development, in the Pacific resort of Puerto Vallarta.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s possible that this reduction is largely due to the potential application of the law,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>It was unclear where those who left Arizona had gone, but most were probably elsewhere in the United States, it added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 30 percent of Arizona&rsquo;s 6.6 million people are Hispanic, according to US census data. One third of them are foreign born, including the estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants in the state.<br>

		<p>The exodus of Mestizos from Arizona, means that the people of Arizona will have less violent crime, less traffic, fewer rapes, and lower rent payments. There are now 100,000 job vacancies that will be opened up for American citizens. Forget Sarah Palin. Governor Jan Brewer should be the GOP candidate in 2012.</p>

		<p>ONLY 23% went back to mexico?  Dude.  That&rsquo;s a spectacular outcome considering how easy it was for mestizos to simply relocate to a &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; city.</p>
<p>It shows that even minimal resistance to this invasion will rout them and send them packing.  Imagine what a serious attempt to get them to leave might do.</p>
<p>Imagine if it became impossible, due to tough new federal laws, conveniently likely to pass soon, to get any social services whatsoever?</p>
<p>This problem can be fixed and quite easily&hellip;..provided we, as a nation choose to.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical of how they arrived at 100,000 who supposedly left.</p>
<p>The only way to get them to truly return to Mexico is for the economy to crash, so they won&rsquo;t have jobs.  They won&rsquo;t have freebies either, because the states are going bankrupt just like the feds so money won&rsquo;t be there to give away to the shameless parasites.</p>

<p>Just how are 720,000 unemployed foreign nationals surviving in our country?</p>

<p>If this is true, how many crossed over our border illegally coming into America? I am sure ten times that small amount.</p>
<p> I am sure that the 23,380 have all come back by now, if they even left in the first place, which I doubt. The media loves to report made up numbers to make us think it is all so true. The majority left to go to other states, more than likely California. </p>

		<p>The only rout psychology that Hispanics will ever be subject to is that which says they cannot get S8 Housing, Food Stamps or Free School/Medical.</p>
<p>It may help, a little, if companies are forced to report illegals.  But only a little because those who can&rsquo;t get jobs won&rsquo;t necessarily go home and it will be nearly impossible to level the boards in terms of application of a punitive law.</p>
<p>Having said that, the real victims of the ongoing &#8216;psychological warfare&rsquo; operation in this country should be obvious, every time you look in the mirror.</p>
<p>Strange thing about human psychology: the more you say something works, the more &#8216;the system&rsquo; seems to be endorsing a given action.  And the more foolish people kick back and trust The System with it&rsquo;s designated caretakers, to regulate and prosecute it&rsquo;s specified mission.</p>
<p>Which in turn takes a lot of the wind out of the sales of such things as SB-1070 (and others like it).  Along with the **BORDER SECURITY**.</p>
<p>Which is the only &#8216;by the numbers&rsquo; approach whose reporting agency (presumably BP or Homeland Security) should be statistically trusted.</p>
<p>Because as another poster said: It&rsquo;s not how many leave, or even if they do.  It&rsquo;s how many come in to replace them and begin the:</p>
<p>Low Skills.<br>
No Fluency.<br>
Four Kids.<br>
Depressed Wages.<br>
Government Supported Housing/Meds/Food.</p>
<p>Parade all over again.</p>
<p>What this all comes down to is a desperate attempt to keep Obama and Treason off the radar screen.  Because nobody among our higher ups wants immigration to end.  On either side of the party divide.  And that can only happen so long as the President is shielded from the consequences of an obvious dereliction of his most basic duty.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only way the U.S. People are going to make it clear how mad we are with ALL of them is to impeach POTUS for failure to secure the borders, as the nation, &#8216;from all enemies, internal and external&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That will at least make it public: Big Business cannot compete with overseas slave labor unless it has in-house slaves to compensate at all the scut-work positions which now pay too little to interest indigene Americans.</p>
<p>Americans can no longer pay for all the fringe benefits which Big Business now relies on to sweeten the deal.</p>
<p>That will be the point where some honesty about economics of supranationalist corporate profit margins begins to be discussable.</p>
<p>Race Replacement and Illegal Immigration are simply masks-at-the-ball for the fact that _Global Capitalism Itself Is A Massive Failure_.  And will get worse so long as it is beyond the control and regulation of individual, national, economies whom it vicimizes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the working classes among white Americans who are feeling the sting the worst.  Because we are the only population group without a national enabler agency to back us up.</p>
<p>The good news being that: if we have no one who is loyal to us, we have no reason to be loyal to anyone but ourselves and our own interests.  Which, at least here, are vastly larger than even Big Business is comfortable confronting.</p>
<p>Start with Obama.  Put him in the spotlight.  Seal The Border.  And get ready for a fight to the impeachment finish when those who think they &#8216;own&rsquo; our leadership tell their puppets to ignore their constituency.</p>

		<p>Because nobody among our higher ups wants immigration to end.</p>
<p>This is a popular sentiment due to a defeatist attitude, bitterness and quite frankly, a creeping culture of victimization among white nationalists (not to mention laziness&hellip;..it takes no actual effort to throw up your hands and give up).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out of line with reality.</p>
<p>The right people are now in place politically and the right attitudes in place nationally that it has become quite possible to forcibly expel most immigrants from this country.  Sooner rather than later I think.</p>
<p>It will start with tough new laws.  Then the states will implement long planned agendas to make their territory uncomfortable, even dangerous for immigrants.  Those who don&rsquo;t, initially, will face increasing economic pressure to do so as they absorb multiples of their &#8220;share&#8221; of the invaders.</p>
<p>But that pales in comparison to what will happen when the war in mexico (the one our media won&rsquo;t admit has been going on for years now) spills over the border and our country is subject to overt attack.</p>
<p>The reaction will be 9/11 times a hundred.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bottom line.</p>

		<p>Funny thing, I always had to show I.D. when I got a job, or had any contact at all with the police, even though the most serious thing I ever did was ride a bicycle on the sidewalk.  It never would have occurred to me to use a fake social security number.<br>
But then I was raised to respect the laws of my country, unlike these trespassers who have no respect for our laws or our country.<br>
Try going to Mexico without I.D., or overstaying your visa there, much less getting a job that a Mexican could be doing, and see what happens to you.  I am genuinely afraid of going to jail, because it would be shameful and a disgrace for my family.  If you are the kind of person for whom jail poses no shame, then jail in America is not so bad.  From what I hear, they are given a clean place to sleep and passable food, and all their &#8220;rights&#8221; are respected.  But imagine if you get thrown in jail in Mexico; what a hell-hole that must be.  It is not an equal playing field; an illegal alien can come to the U.S. and what does he have to lose?  Even if he goes to jail for a few weeks and is then deported, it&rsquo;s no worse than where he came from, and there is no shame at all back in his little hometown.<br>
But we always have to be on our best behavior.<br>
Let all illegal aliens get out of America, and good riddance.</p>

<p>Well! Isn&rsquo;t that peculiar!  We were told that there was no way on earth to repatriate 13 million illegals.  Impossible, couldn&rsquo;t be done, wasn&rsquo;t going to happen.  Now, it seems that all that has to be done is to pass a law that says they&rsquo;re not welcome.  Imagine that.  Easy as pie.<br>
So, why were we lied to about it being an insurmountable obstacle by liberals who wanted them to stay?  I guess I answered my own question.</p>

<p>THE POINT BEING: These people didn&rsquo;t go back to Mexico or wherever else they came from they just move up into neighboring states. </p>

<p>Are you really sure about that? I have noticed they say one thing &#8220;about loving America&#8221; but will turn on a dime when it comes to defending their people.  Maybe not in front of Whites, but they most assuredly think and feel that way among themselves.</p>
