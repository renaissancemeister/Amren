<h1>A Brave New World Controversy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Thomas, KIRO-FM (Seattle), Nov. 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Something 10th graders at Nathan Hale High School in Seattle did was so upsetting to a student and her mom that it&rsquo;s resulted in a curriculum change at the school, and apologies from the principal.</p>
<p>What were they doing? Reading. Reading Aldous Huxley&rsquo;s Brave New World as part of their language arts curriculum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarah Sense-Wilson&rsquo;s daughter was required to read the novel for a class at Nathan Hale. She is Native American, and her heart started to sink as she turned the pages to find more than 30 references to &#8220;savage natives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was very upset and she said, &#8216;Mom I need to tell you something, but I don&rsquo;t want you to get mad. There&rsquo;s a book I have to read in my class and it portrays Indian people as being savages and living on reservations,&rsquo;&#8221; Sense-Wilson says.</p>
<p>She tried to read the book for herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was outraged when I read through the book. I had to keep putting it down because it was so hurtful,&#8221; says Sense-Wilson. &#8220;It was traumatizing to read how Indian people were being depicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The text has a &#8220;high volume of racially offensive derogatory language and misinformation on Native Americans. In addition to the inaccurate imagery, and stereotype views, the text lacks literary value which is relevant to today&rsquo;s contemporary multicultural society,&#8221; she wrote in a complaint earlier this year to Nathan Hale and district administrators.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The chair of the language arts department, Shannon Conner, defended the merits of the book calling it a &#8220;superb warning book about our future. Huxley cautions his future readers from becoming too reliant on, and compliant with, technology.&#8221; But at the same time, the high school apologized and determined that the &#8220;cultural insensitivity embedded in this book makes it an inappropriate choice as a central text in our 10th grade curriculum.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are no longer using the book. Sense-Wilson says she&rsquo;s &#8220;proud of&#8221; the way Nathan Hale has responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ve really listened, they have invited us to be part of the school, they now have a a native club and they&rsquo;re extending themselves to really try to repair that damage,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>{snip} Sense-Wilson wants other high schools in Seattle to stop using it in their curriculum too. The Seattle School board is meeting this afternoon to discuss the use of the book Brave New World.</p>
<p>{snip}.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not about book burning and we&rsquo;re not radicals,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not trying to in any way censor that book, we&rsquo;re just saying it does not belong in high school. It is not appropriate for the curriculum.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the book is an important or interesting novel for teenagers, she suggests putting it in the library.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Incidentally, any resident in the Seattle school district, or any parent or guardian of a child enrolled in the district, may challenge instructional materials schools use. The district has a 10-step process to determine if the complaint about a book or material is justified.<br>

		<p>The English language was invented by Whites and used against humankind. Outlaw the racist English language.</p>
<p>But first, all Whites should charge non whites a language tax for speaking to us with our own invention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gimme my restorative justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gimme my ten dollars for speaking to me in my language that I gave to you without charging you a fee. Using my language against me is a violation of my Civil Rights and Human Dignity. Pay up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Racist!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;ll be twenty dollars, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whenever you see a black using any invention created by White Genius, you have a moral right to demand a usage tax on the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are using a cell phone.  That was invented by Whites. You owe me a race usage tax.  How about five dollars per call?&#8221;<br>

		<p>I can feel a certain sympathy for this little girl.  While the Amerindians were culturally primitive when compared with the white Europeans who settled on the America continent, they had no monopoly on sheer savagery when compared with the behavior of their white counterparts, which included treacherous betrayals, gross treaty violations, slaughter of the buffalo with the intention of starving the Indians, and in general a total lack of regard for the rights of the native populations they encountered.</p>
<p>Maybe this was all inevitable, as the continued existence of Indian reservations would seem to imply.  The Indians seemed to want no part of the white man&rsquo;s world.  Perhaps they&rsquo;d evolved socially and culturally in perfect accommodation with the world they inhabited.  Unfortunately for them, they weren&rsquo;t strong enough in terms of numbers or technology to successfully resist their displacement on this continent.  But I wouldn&rsquo;t say they were, on average, any more savage or morally deficient than the whites who displaced them.</p>

		<p>The correct solution is to &#8220;deal with it&#8221;.  Take the book on its merits, and if you must, have a discussion about the &#8220;savage&#8221; portrayal.  You don&rsquo;t yank the entire book because someone is (supposedly) offended, which in fact simply means that they are testing their power.</p>

		<p>This will never stop until the only books assigned in public schools are written by minorities and self-hating white liberals.  Non-whites care about emotional arguments and &#8220;pride&#8221; far more than facts, history or progress.  My husband and I are proudly homeschooling our kids - they will have the education and historical perspectives that will be practically outlawed soon.  </p>
<p>Any White parents who keep their kids in public schools may as well punch their own children in the stomach every day before sending them to the bus.  If you can&rsquo;t afford private school, look into home schooling co-ops and get a local homeschooling family to educate your kids for a little cash under the table.  <br>

		<p>It is going to come, eventually, to the removal of virtually all of our classical canon of literature.  Libraries will have to be cleaned out, gutted.  The way we&rsquo;re going, this is inevitable, as there&rsquo;s hardly anything written before 1960 that bowed to Political Correctness (or was even aware of it). </p>
<p>Back then, writers simply told it &#8220;like it is&#8221; without worrying about &#8220;offending&#8221; someone&rsquo;s delicate sensibilities. Of course, they were writing for a white audience, their own people.  We didn&rsquo;t have Diversity then.  </p>
<p>I recall one of the James Bond books (Goldfinger?) written in 1959, which refers repeatedly to Koreans as savages or uncivilized.  It wouldn&rsquo;t get printed in Britain today.  Or Fleming would be imprisoned for Hate Speech. Obviously, Ian Fleming viewed Koreans with scorn and didn&rsquo;t fear to say so.  Even I was surprised at his contempt.  But at that time Korea had not yet undergone its economic miracle, and was still poor and backward. I remember a highschool friend who came back from army duty in Korea about 1970 and spoke of it as nothing but a frigid, barren desert. Like Fleming, he hated it. (He loved Japan.)  </p>
<p>Just imagine what Ian Fleming would have to say about Africans and such! He could not even have imagined Somalis and Sudanese being brought here, compared to whom Koreans represent the height of refinement and civilization.</p>
<p><i>Brave New World </i>was one of the seminal books of my youth that changed my life and thinking. It made me stop and think, and question many things that we take for granted. But I read it after high school. I do think it is a bit too sophisticated for high school kids. I don&rsquo;t remember anything in it about Indians, but I do remember Huxley&rsquo;s references to  rampant African fertility. What would the NAACP have to say?  That too wouldn&rsquo;t get published in Britain today. Huxley would be on trial for hate charges.</p>
<p>As I said, writers then were free to say what they had to say. They didn&rsquo;t have to worry about not bruising the delicate feelings of a thousand touchy &#8220;minorities&#8221;, as we do now in this Brave New Age of Diversity.  Huxley had a brilliant mind and  aa amazing imagination, but he never imagined THAT!</p>

		<p>Part of my English Lit class in senior year of high school was assigned this book, when we dealt with the dystopian genre of 20th Century England.  (Others got 1984, and others got another book whose title I can&rsquo;t remember   &mdash;   NOT Animal Farm).  The class was almost half white, almost half black, one Asian and one Indian (Native American), and the Native American was on the 1984 team.  Funny, none of us who got BNW came away hating our classmate.</p>

		<p><i>Brave New World</i> is not deemed unacceptable because of its depiction of a soft totalitarianism that encourages recreational drug use and casual sex.  After all, that is the Western world today.  Nope, the book must be banned because it talks about savage natives.  Well, any honest look at early American history shows that the natives could certainly be savage when they had a mind to.<br>

		<p>It has been a while since I read BNW but as I recall  &mdash;  and someone correct me if I am wrong  &mdash;  the protagonist deeply admires the savages and runs away to the reservation to live with them, deeming them more human than those living in mainstream society. So the depiction of them was much more in line with the myth of the noble savage. Even if I am mistaken, however, it is simply preposterous to think that &#8220;the text lacks literary value which is relevant to today&rsquo;s contemporary multicultural society&#8221;. </p>

<p>Music and art too.</p>
<p>The Western Canon has already been amended.  </p>
<p><i>Sense-Wilson wants other high schools in Seattle to stop using Brave New World in their curriculum too. ..We are not about book burning&hellip;</i></p>
<p>You are exactly about burning books, about using the force of government to accomplish your goal.</p>
<p>Wonderful stories such as <i>The Most Dangerous Game</i> and van Tilburg Clark&rsquo;s <i>The Portable Phonograph</i> are no longer taught, and, it won&rsquo;t be long until <i>Brave New World</i>,, <i>Clockwork Orange</i> and <i>1984</i>, the great, intellectual, dystopian novels of the 20th century are ironically banned, purged from libraries and schools and burned in giant pyres.</p>
<p><i>In 1999, the Modern Library ranked Brave New World fifth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.</i></p>
<p>Not for long.  The list will soon begin with <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, and be devoid of White males.</p>
<p>The losers that marched around shouting &#8216;Hey Hey Ho Ho Western Civ has Got to Go!&rsquo; at the universities in the 60s and 70s are now lording over those same institutions, with a Soviet fist, hell-bent on banning the very civilization that coddled them, allowed them to pretend they were marxist revolutionaries and anarchists on university campuses.</p>
<p>Axed from the high school canon are Hemmingway, Faulkner, Steinbeck and Twain, replaced by Richard Wright, Harper Lee, Sandra Cisneros and Toni Morrison, the Brave New World of required reading centered on race identity and victimization at the hands of Whites.</p>
<p>Ironically:</p>
<p><i>Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one.</i></p>
<p>Yes, a seminal novel, prescient, the product of a brilliant mind, and in Britain today, Huxley would be brought up and jailed on charges of &#8216;inciting hate.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>O Brave New World!  That Has Such People in It!</i></p>
<p>Pass the soma.</p>

		<p>The odd thing is, the Indian character in Brave New World, John, is something of a hero. A true man who stands opposed to the artificiality of the World State. But then again, perhaps this is the real reason the book got banned. It might get young &#8216;uns thinking about the emerging multicultist world state. </p>

		<p>firstly, IMO we should object to calling Amerindians &#8220;Native Americans&#8221;, since anyone born in American is by definition a native American. By usurping the label &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; Amerindians would be implying that the rest of us are mere interlopers as if we are not true Americans. We are all native Americans who are born here.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Amerindians were are collection of mostly waring stone age tribes that seemed to have a great predilection for extreme torture - see the books &#8220;The Wild Frontier&#8221;, &#8220;Our Savage Neighbors: How Indian War Transformed Early America &#8221; and for a horrifying first hand account by a young survivor see &#8220;The White&#8221; by Deborah Larsen.</p>

<p>Been reading revisionist history books have we, John? I suggest you read something written before 1960 to see the truth. Indians weren&rsquo;t innocent victims. They loved to torture their captives, betrayed their &#8220;friends&#8221; and broke many treaties.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true whites are slowly being written out of history. People of color are not bigots, they&rsquo;re just more comfortable with reading about and being around people who look like them. However, if all the books were replaced, this would be an advantage to whites. Even the books white children use, especially the books white children use, are deconstructive and anti-white as it is. </p>

		<p>Amazing. One complaint and goodbye Huxley. What do these Seattle liberals think they&rsquo;ve accomplished, anyway? I mean, it&rsquo;s not like they can actually &#8220;ban&#8221; this or any other novel just by removing it from their school library or taking it out of the curriculum. If there are any students who actually want to read Brave New World, all they have to do is go to the local bookstore or library, not to mention the fact that the entire book is available for free on the internet. I wonder if this school added huxley.net to their internet filters? Probably not. The situation&rsquo;s really pretty amusing because even though they might have removed the hardcopy book from their shelves, I&rsquo;ll bet you anything that these students can most likely still get access to it using their library computers. How many of them will do just that now that the book has been banned? How many of them wouldn&rsquo;t have read the book otherwise? It would be interesting to find out.</p>
<p>People are always getting themselves into an uproar about &#8220;book bannings&#8221; and &#8220;censorship,&#8221; but the truth is that there are no banned books in the United States. Not really. Some school or library is always &#8220;banning&#8221; Huckleberry Finn or Catcher In The Rye or whatever, but it never does them any good. Twilight has been banned. Harry Potter has been banned. It&rsquo;s particularly ridiculous in the cases of Twilight and Harry Potter because you can literally find mountains of these books on display in every bookstore in the country. And somebody like Huxley will always be available. The truth is that there is no way to ban books. No way. The Soviets tried it with Solzhenitsyn and failed. The US tried it with James Joyce and failed. If a book like The Turner Diaries which could never be published by a mainstream publisher or sold in a regular bookstore can be downloaded for free or purchased online from small publishers, do these Seattle liberals really think they can get rid of Brave New World? What a joke. </p>
<p>In my opinion, we should encourage schools to ban books we think kids should read. The bigger the stink, the better. Banning books makes them interesting to people who probably would never have read them in the first place if they had the official stamp of approval. There&rsquo;s nothing like forbidden fruit to catch their interest. Personally, I&rsquo;d like to see the entire Western canon banned by every school in the country. Literature. Music. Art. All of it. Drive it underground. Make it a criminal offense to read the Iliad or listen to Bach or have a Vermeer print hanging on your wall. If Brave New World was still part of the curriculum at this particular school, how many of these 10th graders do you think would have actually read it in the first place? Not many, I&rsquo;ll bet. Now that it&rsquo;s banned, though, more of them might pick up an illicit copy and read it in secret. I know I did this with books like Catcher In The Rye which was banned in my high school at the time. I probably never would have read it otherwise. In fact, I never would have HEARD of it otherwise. Book banning in the schools is a good thing. We need more of it.  </p>

<p>Well said. I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. It is a term meant to discredit white Americans and to de-legitimize our existence on this continent. An attempt to portray us as interlopers and thieves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I&rsquo;ll bet the term wasn&rsquo;t invented by American Indians either, but by  &#8220;white&#8221; Marxists who knew exactly what they were doing.  It&rsquo;s part of the broad cultural assault (culture of critique)  being waged against us by those who want us elimininated from the picture (and they aren&rsquo;t Indians!). No, this clever propaganda term didn&rsquo;t come from Indians.  Since when are America&rsquo;s Indians known as masters of propaganda?</p>

<p>About two or so years ago, I read an article out of Germany where the authorities are beside themselves over teenagers and young adults that take up neo-Naziism.  They want to try to mitigate the &#8220;temptation&#8221; of N/N with various sports programs.  The article states that Naziism, neo or otherwise, is illegal in Germany, but couldn&rsquo;t bring itself to conclude that that is the main reason why so many young people are attracted to it.  The answer is to make soccer illegal and Naziism mandatory, then you&rsquo;ll see teenagers stay far away from Naziism as possible.  If you have a teenager that won&rsquo;t eat his vegetables, write your politicians and ask them to pass a bill to make broccoli illegal.</p>

		<p><i>The truth is that there is no way to ban books. No way. The Soviets tried it with Solzhenitsyn and failed. The US tried it with James Joyce and failed. If a book like The Turner Diaries which could never be published by a mainstream publisher or sold in a regular bookstore can be downloaded for free or purchased online from small publishers, do these Seattle liberals really think they can get rid of Brave New World? What a joke.</i> ..Annon.#23</p>

You have a point.   But, they can make it much more difficult to get, much less easily accessible.  Most of these kids would never have heard of BNW (or Huxley) outside of school and would never bother to look it up on their own. And most of them will never read him again. For some rare individual, an iconoclast with a high IQ,  someone who&rsquo;s really determined to find the book, alright, maybe that one will.   But the truth is, most people, average kids, won&rsquo;t bother. </p>
<p>So, you don&rsquo;t have to ban it. Just making it hard to find is - for most people - enough.</p>
<p>Your amusing suggestion to ban Bach and Vermeer would work well, I suppose, with someone with an IQ over 125.  But it won&rsquo;t work with most people. Most people don&rsquo;t care.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.  But I will go even further to defend  use of the term, &#8220;Indians&#8221;. We are accustomed to it, and we should stick to it.</p>
<p>500 years ago, there was no such country as India. Not even a precise place.  &#8220;The Indies&#8221; were a vague concept, sprawling over a large area of the globe, not any place specific.  Nor were they any political unit or specific people.</p>
<p>You had the East Indies, and the West Indies. The inhabitants of the Indies  (any Indies) were called Indians. (We&rsquo;re not talking about &#8220;India&#8221; here.) Columbus discovered the West Indies, which were populated by &#8220;Indians&#8221;. By extension, Europeans came to describe all the inhabitants of the New World as Indians. None of this had anything to do with India.  The place we call &#8220;India&#8221; today was then a collection of many different kingdoms and peoples: Rajputs, Punjabis, Bengalis, etc. </p>
<p>Actually, the term &#8220;Indian&#8221; for America&rsquo;s original inhabitants is much older that the country known as &#8220;India&#8221;  today, which was only created in 1947.  Before then, when Americans spoke of Indians, there was no confusion. The Indians (from  the new country called India) only appeared on the American scene rather recently.   Someone should have told them that (at least here) the name was already taken.<br>

		<p>To browser, Martel and Calvin John:</p>
<p>Kudos to you, for being determined not to call Native Americans that anymore, but instead to refer to them as &#8220;aborigines&#8221;. For some time now, I&rsquo;ve taught myself to call them &#8220;North American aborigines&#8221;, since the red people and their white lackeys like to point out that they were the first inhabitants of North America.</p>
<p>For those so-called &#8220;Indians&#8221; that live in Mexico, I use the term &#8220;Mexican aborigines&#8221;. Likewise, all of those &#8220;Indians&#8221;, that live in Central and South America (like Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay) are referred to as &#8220;Central American aborigines&#8221;, and &#8216;South American aborigines&#8221;, respectively.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Columbus called the red people he encountered, &#8220;Indians&#8221; because he thought he was in India. For all the vilification the red people do against Columbus, they never have completely discarded the &#8220;Indian&#8221; tag.</p>
<p>For me, the only true Indian people walking planet Earth, are those people from  India, and others like them born in other countries, of Indian extraction. I believe they come from a race known as the Vedda or Veddoid.</p>
<p>Actress Vivian Leigh was born in India. But no way is she an &#8220;Indian&#8221; because both her parents were British whites. On the other hand, poet and 1913 Nobel laureate for Literature, Rabindranath Tagore was Indian.</p>
<p>Ex-Formula One driver Narain Karthekeyan is Indian. Ex-U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell is NOT an Indian, but a North American aborigine.</p>
<p>I realize that the &#8220;Bureau of North American Aborigine Affairs&#8221; sounds awkward, compared to the &#8220;Bureau of Indian Affairs&#8221;, but it is technically correct.</p>
<p>Whatever became of the North American aborigines that Columbus took back with him to Europe? Did they become slaves to the Spanish crown, or were they released in Spain? I&rsquo;ve never seen anything on what ultimately happened to  them.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Interesting question.  I don&rsquo;t know. But they didn&rsquo;t become slaves to the Spanish crown, because Queen Isabela opposed enslaving the Indians. (Yes, I know the colonists did it anyway; they did lots of things that were illegal.) They might have remained in Spain and blended into the populace. Or, very likely, they returned to the Americas and were used as translators and guides. </p>
<p>If they remained in Spain, I suspect they may not have survived very long, due to lack of immunity to Old World diseases. (Pocahontas didn&rsquo;t live long whan taken to England.)</p>
<p>Sorry, I will still continue to call them Indians   &mdash;   (American) Indians from the West Indies. And no, Columbus didn&rsquo;t think he was in India, he thought he was in &#8220;The Indies&#8221;, off the coast of Cathay. As I said, the Indies then referred to a vast area, much more than just India.</p>
<p>Anyway, does it matter?  The name is established now, for 500 years. Why change it to accommodate some people who arrived here after 1965?</p>

&ldquo;Aborigines&rdquo; is five syllables. Still too long. </p>

<p>I had to buy that book because none of the libraries around where I live (upstate New York) would carry it.  Also, try &#8220;mpire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History By S.C. Gwynne,&#8221;<br>
written last year.   This one got by the public library PC censors, and speaks to the routine incredible savagery of the Comanches against both whites (mostly Texans) and their fellow Indians. <br>

		<p>I see no &#8220;sense&#8221; in Sense-Wilson&rsquo;s histrionic crusade.  How does one become educated if one stops reading at the first word that causes offense?  The &#8220;savages&#8221; in this book are not limited to Indians; it includes anybody that did not live in a proper city.</p>
<p>The entire exercise of &#8220;Brave New World&#8221; was to warn people about a Huxleyian totalitarianism.*  I suppose this person would also reject the warning of Orwellian totalitarianism in &#8220;1984&#8221; because the character drank Victory Gin and this clearly encourages alcohol use.  Or ban &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; because it&rsquo;s &#8220;too political.&#8221;</p>
<p>Book-burning is embraced by Thought Police of persuasions both Left and Right, it seems.  By embracing the guise of multicultural sensitivity, this person is becoming a willing ignoramus with no idea in which direction to point their moral and ethical compass.</p>
<p>The world does not need more dilettantes working in coffee houses opining half-formed thoughts on their requisite Apple laptops and living off their trust funds.</p>
<p>*The difference between Huxley and Orwell&rsquo;s totalitarian states?  Bueller?  Bueller?  Huxley proposes control through technology whereas Orwell favors surveillance.  Sense-Wilson, you&rsquo;ve willingly surrendered thought-control to the State by embarking on this Chilren&rsquo;s Crusade, and you will find the results equally tragic.  </p>
<p>There is no merit in promoting ignorance.  There is no merit in restricting access to literature and knowledge.  There is merit in allowing people to exercise their right to educate themselves, form their own opinions and then to engage in a civil debate, rather than whine to the Nanny State and forcibly shove your values down everybody&rsquo;s throat.<br>

<p>I think the word you&rsquo;re looking for is &#8220;aborigine&#8221;. Anyone who is born in a place is a &#8220;native&#8221; of that place.</p>
<p>If you were born in London, you&rsquo;re a native of London, no matter how many other races are living there.  But you are not necessarily aboriginal.</p>
<p>Actually, to be precise, no human races are aboriginal to the Americas, as we all migrated here at one time or another from elsewhere.</p>
