			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Will Kane, San Francisco Chronicle, Nov. 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latinos now make up a majority of California&rsquo;s public school students, cracking the 50 percent barrier for the first time in the state&rsquo;s history, according to data released Friday by the state Department of Education. </p>
<p>Almost 50.4 percent of the state&rsquo;s students in the 2009-10 school year identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino, up 1.36 percent from the previous year. </p>
<p>In comparison, 27 percent of California&rsquo;s 6.2 million students identified themselves as white, 9 percent as Asian and 7 percent as black. Students calling themselves Filipino, Pacific Islander, Native American or other total almost 7 percent. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Corresponding growth</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that Latinos make up the new majority in California schools, considering that their numbers have grown by leaps and bounds in recent decades. In 2009, Latinos made up 37 percent of the state&rsquo;s population, a number that continues to increase, according to the California Department of Finance.</p>
<p>But their electoral sway has not grown by similar amounts, because almost 40 percent of adult Latinos in California are ineligible to vote, said Lisa Garcia Bedolla, an associate professor at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Education. </p>
<p>The challenge, she said, is finding ways to get Latino parents involved in schools when they cannot vote for members of their local school board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In San Francisco, where an estimated one-third of public school students have a parent who was not born in this country, voters were asked this month to allow noncitizens to vote in school board elections. While Proposition D lost, 45 to 55 percent, the support the ballot measure received from civic leaders showed the growing concern about the role of immigrant parents in local schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Everybody bilingual?</strong></p>
<p>Nearly 1.5 million students are English language learners, but many more still struggle in the classroom with difficult, subject-specific terms, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, if you are studying social science, understanding words like &#8216;justice&rsquo; and &#8216;beauty&rsquo; can be difficult,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In math, it can be even harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fuller, the UC Berkeley professor, suggested state educators look at language education in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the majority of the population is becoming bilingual,&#8221; he said, referring to the growing Latino population learning English, &#8220;why shouldn&rsquo;t the white minority also become bilingual?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;If the majority of the population is becoming bilingual,&rdquo; he said, referring to the growing Latino population learning English, &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t the white minority also become bilingual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was at a teacher conference three weeks ago in NYC, and the latina main speaker (an &#8216;expert&rsquo; in ESL education) said a similar thing to us, a group of mostly white teachers (about 100 attendees).  </p>
<p>She justified this by saying that Spanish has a lot of wonderful literature and a great cultural background.  She said all that because some clueless white liberal woman raised her hand and suggested that since so many of our students were latinos, shouldn&rsquo;t we all (the teachers) learn Spanish also.</p>
<p>I held my tongue because of the crowd I was with (young white liberals, some latino activist teachers) but a black woman next to me was clearly upset and made no secret of her disdain for spanish (privately, of course, so as not to lose her job).</p>
<p>Do you see what&rsquo;s happening my friends?  The gloves are coming off and the latinos are now demanding that WE change our ways and learn theirs, including their language.  The arrogance of it all - I&rsquo;m speechless.</p>
<p>America was a dream once.  Then the dream was lost when we were invaded and experienced a slow death by a thousand cuts.  Our grandchildren will be living in a Spanish speaking nation.  Beyond the empty bravado of many, I don&rsquo;t see what we can do about it.  I am really at a loss for words.  Most places I go now, I feel like a stranger, and 20 years ago in those same places, I did not.</p>

		<p>Of the 27% that are classified as white, probably only half of that is native-born white.  </p>

		<p>When California was 90% White, it was the economic powerhouse of the USA, had top-rated schools and universities, and a standard of living and life-style the envy of the World.  </p>
<p>Since then, California has imported millions of Third Worlders, and Whites now make up only ~ 50% of Californians.  The schools, the economy, and the quality of life are disasters.  California is already smelling like a dead fish, and will be the first state to go belly-up.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that if you import poverty, you get poverty!  Who would have ever guessed?  </p>

		<p>That 27% includes a lot of non-whites (Arabs for instance) counted as whiites.  I think it is time the US pulled out of California.  It is lost.  I would rather lose California and keep the rest of the US than have no country at all.  Better to lick one&rsquo;s wounds, learn from one&rsquo;s mistakes and live to fight another day than chuck it all.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanic schoolchildren in California outnumber whites by nearly two to one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biblical phrase,  &#8220;He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind,&#8221; might apply to some extent here, because the alien invasion surely has caused many, many problems for California, which has brought it to the brink.</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;ll get a government bailout&hellip;&hellip;ONCE and only ONCE, because the fed will soon be in worse shape than California and won&rsquo;t have anything to give but worthless paper money.   The bailout will only delay the inevitable, which is the collapse of the Golden State.</p>
<p>The &#8220;majority&#8221; can sit back and enjoy living in Tijuana North.  </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be jumping with glee just yet, for overwhelming the honkies, if I were part of the mestizo tribe.  Coming from Mexico into California just might mean jumping from the frying pan into the fire.</p>

		<p>Think any of these talking heads will ever show some real alarm about nonwhites taking over our country? No, they won&rsquo;t. They are cowards and afraid to say anything about any nonwhite, let alone, say that this will not be tolerated any longer. They would rather lose their own country and condemn their own race to hell all from the fear of being labeled a racist. Who would have ever thought that this country would be lost over a WORD???  One local talking head here in California mentioned this and said. I have NO problem with &#8220;hispanic&#8221; students comprising 50% of the school age population! In other words this moron is saying, it is a good thing!..Just like Bill Clinton said it will be good when Whites here become a minority! </p>

		<p>I at least thought that Latino students had made a majority a California public schools some years ago for various reasons: higher Hispanic fertility, exodus of (presumably) mostly whites and blacks (CA mayors have bemoaned their lowering black populations), the fact more whites send their children to private schools (though other races also do this, in lower rates).</p>

		<p>The LA area has a huge middle eastern population that has grown rapidly over the last 20 years:  Persians, Armenians, Israelis, Jews, Arabs etc.  These people are counted as white in these statistics.  </p>
<p>Even if you accept some of these people as &#8220;white,&#8221; it&rsquo;s clear that these groups are all significantly different from other &#8220;white&#8221; Americans(who are from Europe) and tend to be more loyal to their own group than the country.  </p>

<p>Um because when you move to another country, you should learn the language of that country,not expect the natives to learn your language. Hispanics are the ones who came so they should learn English, the Whites are the natives. Of course, mass immigration shouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed in the first place.</p>

		<p>California is the canary in the mine, and it is dying so make a conclusion. I think Igor Paninin was correct in his thinking on the breakup of the USA. California cannot, repeat cannot, compete with the East Asian nations given the demographics. The quicker we ( flyover land) lose California the better.<br>
China will probably wind up owning it anyway by mid-century; California will have a vote to join China&rsquo;s trading bloc or continue being broke. No brainer.</p>

		<p>I disagree with the comments of &#8220;Squadrista&#8221; about Spanish being a &#8220;Third World language.&#8221; The first European novel is considered to be &#8220;Don Quijote&#8221; by Miguel de Cervantes. The list of authors of the Golden Age of Spanish literature and on to the present is comparable to those of other European countries, and numerous authors from Latin America, like Borges from Argentina, can in no way be considered inferior.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep the discussion to more real issues, like the huge influx of illegal aliens from Latin America which has been a continuous and growing problem over the past few decades. This wasn&rsquo;t the case under the Eisenhower administration in the 1950&rsquo;s, when he set up a program to send them back, and the &#8220;Bracero program&#8221; worked well as far as bringing needed seasonal workers in to pick lemons, grapes and other fruit. (My father at that time had a lemon ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif. which took advantage of this program along with the other ranchers) </p>

<p>It will never be &#8216;our turn&rsquo; with non-Whites!</p>
<p>&#8216;Playing fair&rsquo; and being held accountable before the law are White Traits, a reflection of Western Civilization which itself is a reflection of White DNA.</p>
<p>The Rule of Law is breaking down, mightily and quickly, as I&rsquo;m writing this. As it is, SCOTUS is hanging on by a thread&hellip;</p>
<p>Once we Whites are in the minority (as we are in California) non-Whites, who have been steeped in White Hate for four decades via the educational system and media will turn on us with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the California Supreme Court upheld the &#8216;rights&rsquo; of illegal aliens to receive in-state tuition at California&rsquo;s universities and state colleges.  There will be more of this type of legislation, a lot more, in the near future. </p>
<p>Remember the ANC was &#8216;supposed&rsquo; to give SA an &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; government, fair in treatment to one and all, black and White.  As I hope you know, SA is anything but under black rule with White land confiscated and Whites themselves, including the elderly and little children, hunted down and raped, tortured and hacked to death, without a peep from the UN, Western Media or Human Rights Groups.</p>
<p>This will be our fate as well.</p>
<p>Some on these threads recommend &#8216;cutting California loose&rsquo; (yeah, like that&rsquo;s really &#8216;gonna&rsquo;  happen) from the US because it is a lost cause, and with that I have no argument.</p>
<p>But, let me ask you this:  What makes you think you will escape California&rsquo;s fate given current demographic trends?</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>If you want to see what the US will look like in 2050, come to California.</p>

<p> Alas, as a Southerner, I fear &#8220;our&#8221; government would never let us peacefully separate. Some form of partition may be our only salvation in the future. Only a major depression or uncontrolled hyperinflation could make such a peaceful secessionist scenario possible. </p>

		<p>I agree with some of our prognosticators. That it actually will take a Civil War   &mdash;   Whites against Latinos, to rid our country of this problem once and for all. Bloody? Certainly. But well worth the cost to restore our country to what it was like in the past. If it comes to that, I&rsquo;d bet a lot of people would step in and do the job that needs to be done.</p>

<p>Very true, I am sad to say.  Whites cannot expect the same benefits and advantages that we have generously given to other &#8220;minorities&#8221;.  We will be the objects of their wrath, not generosity.   And when everything breaks down, they will be more wrathful than ever. All their compounded  problems will be considered Whitey&rsquo;s fault   &mdash;    they have been conditioned to think that way by years of relentless propaganda.</p>

<p>California is living on borrowed time. But then, so are we all.  The rest of us are  just following a few years behind.<br>

PS.  Unlike its many critics here, I have always been fond of California. And that goes back for many years.   I still am.  I remember it when it was uncrowded  and beautiful. And white. But I am a realist.   California&rsquo;s  massive minorities are spoiled; they are accustomed to living in a rich and generous welfare state. They don&rsquo;t know how to fend for themselves and  live on nothing.  They expect endless handouts.  They think the government is a bottomless well.  When the money flow stops,  the dollar collapses, and all order breaks down, and the racial gangs start battling each other  for the crumbs,  and for  turf, California  (a former paradise) will be a good place not to be.</p>
<p>By that time, Europe could be in flames too.  It may be under open assault from the Third World,  a la &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221;.    Where would be a safe place? South America? Japan?  Would they want us, having messed up our own country so badly?  I would  think not. Why should they?</p>

		<p>California is kind of strange. There are very nice &#8216;white&rsquo; areas where it still looks like America and then you can travel five miles and maybe be shot at or rear ended or crashed into or see drug deals. Either way it is a rough place right now for both groups and it is getting harder. </p>

		<p>&#8220;almost 40 percent of adult Latinos in California are ineligible to vote&#8221;<br>
I presume that means they are illegal. I would not be the least upset if all of those illegal parents, along with their children, and any legal citizen parents living with them were instantly deported (by armed force, if necessary) and never allowed back in. Birthright citizenship should be instantly repealed and retroactively stripped from anyone born to illegal invaders since 1935 (as that would include just about anyone living today.)</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, California is lost. It&rsquo;s too late now, therefore, learn Spanish and assimulate or move north. That&rsquo;s the reality, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I believe Ca. will become something like Porto Rico. Enjoy the benefits of being in the union, but not really be part of it - culturally. </p>

		<p>Spanish is such a simple language.  I studied it for six years (along with one year of French just for kicks and giggles).</p>
<p>At least when I learned it, it was by choice.  But back in the mid-80s they were telling us that Spanish was the USA&rsquo;s second language, or second most common, something along that line.</p>

		<p>Spanish may be a European language but it is rapidly becoming associated with the third world, especially because of the failed Spanish colonies of South America. Anything associated with blacks rapidly gains a negative connotation and the same is true of Spanish, at least in the U.S.  </p>
<p>No children of mine will ever learn Spanish in school. It is your duty and obligation to make sure your progeny learn European languages as a connection to their heritage at least.

<p><br>
This entire post illuminates a number of salient points which are encapsulated by the aforementioned authors. Distilling them into the following we see:</p>
<p>1. Affirmative Action, Quotas, Special &#8220;Outreach&#8221; Programs, Generous Business Grants, etc are being given to every racial and national group but White Native Born Americans, despite the latter being a minority in a number of states, hundreds of the largest counties, and almost every major city in the country. </p>
<p>2. There are de facto no-go areas for police. Enforcement of the law in non-white areas has essentially ended due to various &#8220;Civil Rights Laws&#8221; and &#8220;Civil Suites&#8221;. In turn, this has lead to further subversion of the peace and tranquility of Native Born White Americans who are the majority of victims of inter-racial crime.</p>
<p>3. The spread of these non-white foreign populations and the support and preferences given them has been accompanies by mass crime especially targeted at Native Born White Americans. This in turn has caused Native Born Whites at various stages and hesitant starts to form community organization dedicated to their own protection.  However, all of these half-hearted starts have been quashed by Federal and State governments who declare such activities as &#8220;Hate&#8221; and &#8220;Racist&#8221; and &#8220;Threatening&#8221;.</p>
<p>4. The combination of generous privileges to non-whites and non-Americans, Criminal syndicates controlling business and street activities, lackluster police enforcement, and criminalization of Native Born White American Organizations, has left the later with just two options: Second class Citizenship or even Serfdom and eternal or escape. </p>
<p>5. In California, the state along with New York, most advanced in its decay as an American state, the result has seen the a large number of White Native Born Americans, some 5,000,000 to 7,500,000 flee the state and the remainder choosing to stay in various enclaves, localities, or Counties, where they either grip to their Liberties against enroaching Corporate plutocrats and their hessian immigrants, or help, as Collaborationists, with the destruction of the White Native American Liberty.</p>
<p>5. Simulteneously, &#8220;indoctrination&#8221; of school children, media audiences, and readers in anti-American hate, especially of native born white Americans, has led to the situation where Native Born White Americans are now directly threatened with the high likelihood of being exterminated in a mass genocide. </p>
<p>6. Some, White Native Born Americans are secretly organizing to stop such a &#8220;Final Solution&#8221; of the American nation. </p>
<p>Consequently, when faced with such an perfidious and ghoulish conclusion, a people has only one true and real ability for its survival. It must fight back with every means necessary. And the means and legitimacy of that fight are found in the bedrock of the American nation, those true and legitimate &#8220;Native Americans&#8221;. </p>
<p>These are the people who are descended from the Protestant English, Scottish, Scots-Irish, Welsh, and assorted smaller numbers of Protestant Dutch, Huegenot, and German nationalities, which around 1776 faced with an incipient Imperial regime which they saw as threatening to their Freedom, organized a Secession through a Constitutional Convention. They organized their local self-defense forces, organized local Conventions, and when their rights to associate and pleade for new government was met by tyrants operating under the color of the Law, they met such injustice with violent and angry righteousness, and on the fielf of battle secured their freedom &#8220;AND THAT OF OUR POSTERITY&#8221; for evermore.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the 1780&rsquo;s in Kentucky and Tennessee, the same individuals organized Secessionist Constitutional Conventions which forced the Seaside American aristocracy to abandon the last of its Imperial British pretensions and allow for the due process of forming local and state governments within the Union.  </p>
<p>Again in the early 1800&rsquo;s their children formed Constitutional Conventions under THEIR ANGLO-SAXON LAW, within the host provinces of European colonies in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas paving the way for responsible local self-government. In the case of Florida and Louisiana, these Conventions eventually asked for incorporation per their established legal precedence into the American Union and following negotiations between them, US and European diplomates secured their Freedom from Europe and incorporation into the US as Sovereign States. </p>
<p>In the case of Texas, that Convention of Criollo Mexicans and Americans was considered rebellious by Spanish rulers, and was ruthlessely suppressed during the Green Republic fight against General Arredoondo.  When Texas was re-populated by Americans in the 1820&rsquo;s, when Mexico again turned to its Catholic Myscegenated roots of Indian barbarism and Spanish Absolutism, the Amerians organized another Constitutional Convention, and with its militia, defeated the Mexicans and secured Texan independence. Their appeal for Union was denied, and for ten years, little Texas proved how although isolated, native Americans in the tradition of their Anglo-Saxon forebearers proved their ability to secure their liberties against all threats. </p>
<p>Finally, when Northern Oligarchic interests combined with emasculated Transcedental Puritanism and threated to turn on the very traditions which had given the North its freedom, the South similarly organized Conventions which eventually seceeded from a Union much as their forefathers had done against their British cousins. This time Southern cousin fought against Northern cousin until the South was brought to its knees. But not with this defeat was the knowledge of liberty lost, but with a single act of terrorism which assassinated President Lincoln followed by a military coup de etat which toppled the Johnson Administration and overthrew the legitimate civil governments of the recently re-incorporated Southern states as well as significant numbers of northern politicians opposed to Radical Republicanism, was liberty lost.</p>
<p>Today, after a Gilded Age of Corruption initiated by those criminal Radical Republican Rober Barons, attempts at mitigating their power, manipulation into one World War, a Great Depression which ended local economies, a Second World War which cemented Centralization, and a Cold War which spread anew the power of the Robber Baron Class, native born White Americans, of all ancestries, including those descended from lawful and invited immigrants from Europe, are facing something worse than any of the Native Americans faced against the British, the Indians, the Mexicans, or the Yankees.  </p>
<p>The only way a meaningful resistance can be organized is one dedicated to establishing local grass-roots Constitutional Conventions much like their forbearers had done in the past. United with other similar groups, and under due process of law, these Conventions, united, can seize back the reins of government from the plutocratic criminal gangsters and foreign collaboraters who now run the country.  IF YOU DO NOT, any organization of resistance prepared in case of failure of the normal political process a the national level, will FAIL IGNOBELY.  </p>
<p>As to the States, such as California, they can still be saved, but not through the normal political process. Only grass-roots Constitutional Conventions organized by the locality, and united with the purpose of securing lawful government, can save California at the State level. Worse, given the infiltration of other states, particularly on the East Coast and now even Texas and the Southwest, it is unlikely that normal political process can save the nation, and thus Constitutional Conventions are likely needed there as well.  </p>
<p>So, to better prepare a Lawful government to give legitimacy to Ranger&rsquo;s hint, ALL Patriots should discreetely, if not covertly, even clandestinely, organize local associations dedicated to establishing grass roots local Constituitonal Conventions, which will have authority within their local jurisdiction to assume governing functions in the case of unlawfull activity by current established authorities.  Unless that occurrs, what is left of America, if any, will be a small country, probably a tributary of larger super-organizations, and Liberty will be extinguished from the earth, and with it, probably most of the Native Born White American population by 2050.</p>
<p>This is the time, when those who are descended of lawful immigrants since the founding of this Union, will prove their character. For those who still claim to be Native Americans, this time will prove whether you have the right to continue freely with your inheritance. If you all succeed, your glory and the nobility of your success will be equal to the Founding Fathers! LIBERTY OR DEATH!!</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind words and acknowledgement of my commentary.</p>
<p>It brings me no joy to report these things about the degradation and disintegration of life in California and the entrenched socialist muck of the White hating educational-complex.  It is not by choice that I am a soldier on the Front Lines of the Culture Wars and have a Front-Row seat, watching as my city and state are destroyed and descend into madness.</p>
<p>I call it as I see it.  </p>
<p>You and a few others on here &#8216;get it&rsquo;, understand what is being done to us Whites by the USG, media and academia   &mdash;   and what is being planned for our future. Really, nothing else matters.  We White Californians are a little more down the &#8216;paved road&rsquo; than Whites in other states.</p>
<p>From reading your posts, I know you understand these issues and see what is happening to us Whites the same way I do; I wish more did, including members of my own family.</p>
<p>Last week, I went to the usual coin store where I buy gold whenever I can. I&rsquo;d had my eye on and been coveting a beautiful French coin and I figured it was now or never (I am trying to get rid of as many dollars as I can before the vile QE II hits, and once it hits I believe gold will rise to $3-5,000 or more, but I digress, as I often do&hellip;.bad habit.)</p>
<p>There was a crowd gathered in front of the store when I arrived (something I had never seen before), the owner hadn&rsquo;t arrived yet to open for the day.  When the security gates opened, these people poured into the store.  I wanted to look at the coin carefully again so I told the owner to help everyone else first.</p>
<p>I watched as these people, all desperate, all White, all ages young and old, pulled out their gold jewelry, some of it looking like valuable heirlooms, including wedding rings, earrings bracelets and a few stray coins, some arguing with the owner, asking if he &#8216;could do better.&rsquo;  All gladly took the cash he offered (probably 10 cents on the dollar).  I was the only one there to buy, not sell.</p>
<p>Is this how is was in the Roman Empire as it was crumbling?  People desperately selling their valuables for increasingly worthless currency that they needed to survive, to purchase food and other basic commodities?  </p>
<p>Are people starting to sense that The Barbarians are at the Gate and that The Calvary is Not Coming?</p>
<p>I bought the French coin, cached it in my Garden Gopher, re-buried it in my flower bed, hoping that I&rsquo;ll never have to make use of it, but having a feeling in the pit of my stomach that at some point I will be forced to use it for barter.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that same way with me.  I marvel over the fact that I have become some kind of a &#8216;link&rsquo; to the America that used to be.  I never thought that would be the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an old man.  I&rsquo;m educated but not particularly worldly.  As I&rsquo;ve seen the rapid decline in all things civilized I&rsquo;ve risen up and become a spokesman for tradition, albeit surreptitiously so as not to lose my job in my &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; multicultural reality.</p>
<p>I was listening to some old songs the other day, &#8220;Hold On&#8221; by Kansas  &#8220;Sweet Child of Mine&#8221; by Bon Jovi and &#8220;Long Time&#8221; by Boston.  It struck me that for the first time I actually noticed the rhythmn of white American culture.  Of course I never noticed it before because I grew up around up.</p>
<p>But now since I&rsquo;ve been around non-whites basically 99% of the time for the last ten years I don&rsquo;t remember what it is to live in a white culture so I can see it for what it is like I can see Mexican culture and understand how different it is.  Strange and tragic, I know.</p>
<p>The songs made me realize that white culture, the true northern and western white culture that built America, propelled the explorers, motivated the crusading knights and bedecked the halls of Charlemagne is based on an unshakeable belief that with hard work and effort, all things are possible.  Dream boldly, and make it happen.</p>
<p>No other culture promotes this ideal.  Chinese and Japanese culture teaches hard work and discipline, but those cultures don&rsquo;t dream.  They don&rsquo;t have the vision-thing going on.  As one person told me, &#8220;They work like ants,&#8221; and this is exactley what I&rsquo;ve seen.  (I live in a rapidly chinese-ing neighborhood.)  </p>
<p>Our new 20 somethings on down have lost a big chunk of that 1500 year legacy.  Now our young men are &#8216;metrosexuals&rsquo; who get their nails done, or preppy whiney good-for-nothings who don&rsquo;t know what a paintbrush is, or thuggy rap wannabe gangstas&rsquo;.  Our young women are turning into hoochie mommas, uber feminists who dream of bantu lovers or bohemian grungers who exude all the charm of a skinny awkward boy in a ratty sweater.</p>
<p>The rhythms of rugged, stoic and honorable Northmen (as northern and western europeans, excluding Spain are called) is fading away.  When I see what&rsquo;s replacing us, helpless minorities who are consumers and not producers, namby pamby liberal &#8216;diversity-is-good-and-whites-are-bad&rsquo; whites and predatory asians, I want to rise up and re-establish the old ways before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>I never thought I would think or feel this way.  Living in the new AMERIKA for the last 20 years has changed me.</p>
