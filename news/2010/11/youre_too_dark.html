			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Peter Jackson&rsquo;s already troubled Hobbit film has become embroiled in accusations of racism after an extra claimed she was told she was too dark to play one of the diminutive Tolkien creatures.</p>
<p>Briton Naz Humphreys, who has Pakistani heritage, attended a casting session in Hamilton, New Zealand, last week and stood in line for three hours only to be told her skin tone was not suitable.</p>
<p>The Waikato Times said video footage from the audition showed the casting manager telling people they were looking for light-skinned people to play Hobbits.</p>
<p>He reportedly tells the would-be Hobbits: &#8216;I&rsquo;m not trying to be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever. It&rsquo;s just the brief. You&rsquo;ve got to look like a Hobbit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Humphreys, who is in New Zealand on a working holiday with her husband, told the newspaper: &#8216;It&rsquo;s 2010 and I still can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m being discriminated against because I have brown skin.</p>
<p>&#8216;The casting manager basically said they weren&rsquo;t having anybody who wasn&rsquo;t pale-skinned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The would-be extra, who is just under 5ft tall, had hoped for a bit part in The Hobbit  &mdash;  a two-part prequel to the Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings films.</p>
<p>But she has now set up a Facebook group called Hire hobbits of all colours! Say no to hobbit racism!</p>
<p>Ms Humphreys, a social policy researcher, said: &#8216;I would love to be an extra.</p>
<p>&#8216;But it just seemed like a shame because obviously Hobbits are not brown or black or any other colour.</p>
<p>&#8216;They all look kind of homogenised beige and all derived from the Caucasian gene pool.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Peter Jackson said he was unaware of the casting restriction and described it as an &#8216;incredibly unfortunate error&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;It is not something the producers or the director of The Hobbit were aware of.</p>
<p>&#8216;They would never issue instructions of this kind to the casting crew.</p>
<p>&#8216;All people meeting the age and height requirements are welcome to audition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The film has been dogged by production problems, many centring from a union dispute that saw studios threaten to move it out of New Zealand.</p>
<p>That row was only settled last month when the New Zealand government offered tax breaks and changed industrial laws.</p>
<p>Previously, the film has been shelved for years by distribution right issues, budget constraints and financial problems at MGM studio.</p>
<p>Director Guillermo del Toro also quit earlier this year.</p>
<p>3D filming is expected to start in February.<br>

								<h2><a href="http://entertainment.msn.co.nz/blog.aspx?blogentryid=746115&amp;showcomments=true">Hobbit Agent Sacked for Racist Comments</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>MSN-NZ, November 29, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A casting agent who told a hobbit hopeful she wasn&rsquo;t &#8216;white&rsquo; enough for the role has been sacked.</p>
<p>Naz Humphreys, who is British Pakistani, queued for three hours to be considered in the Peter Jackson film.</p>
<p>But she was told skin tone wasn&rsquo;t light enough to be an extra.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s 2010 and I still can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m being discriminated against because I have brown skin,&#8221; the actress told media.</p>
<p>&#8220;The casting manager basically said they weren&rsquo;t having anybody who wasn&rsquo;t pale-skinned.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agent had also placed a newspaper ad asking for female hobbit extras with &#8220;light skin tones&#8221; to try out for the role.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Jackson&rsquo;s Wingnut Films told AFP the contractor had since been sacked.</p>
<p>The Hobbit is scheduled to begin filming in 3D next February.<br>

Can someone who has read the Hobbit, Lord of the Ring series tell us what the &#8216;racial&rsquo; description of a Hobbit is?</p>
<p>Are they described in the books as &#8216;white&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The Mahabharata has been made into a film. The characters, from what I recall, were Indians. </p>
<p>If the books describe Hobbits as white, they should be white and there is no need for exceptions or apologies.</p>

		<p>Casting agents look for age, sex, body shape, and talent to fit a role.</p>
<p>Can a person be too old? Of course. </p>
<p>Wrong sex? Of course. </p>
<p>Not the right physicality? Of course.</p>
<p>When ideological doctrine can intrude on the artistic judgement of a casting agent in a private production, you might as well have commissars and multicultural tribunals governing our art. </p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t New Zealand practice &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s Ok to discriminate against those with white skin. Better yet, just pretend it isn&rsquo;t happening at all, even that the reverse is happening, and then count on educators and the media to be complicit in the deception. </p>

		<p>Wow, seriously?  I&rsquo;m not a huge Lord of the Rings fan, but I think everyone knows that its based on some sort of ancient European mythical culture.  European folklore and all that seems to be the main influence.  Obviously, in those days (whatever pre-historical time-period the Hobbit is based on) you didn&rsquo;t have very much race-mixing.  Why would a Hobbit community have a half-breed Indian?  It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  Its a shame the agent was fired for trying to make a good, realistic film.  Can you imagine being in the theaters and seeing a single Indian woman amidst a see of whites, in a medieval-esque setting?  It wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense at all, that&rsquo;s for sure.  I would assume she&rsquo;s a captive slave from a far-off land or something.</p>

		<p>Well, the three &#8216;Lord of the Rings&rsquo; movies all showed Hobbitton as a white-themed place with medieval pastoral overtones, so for the prequel to suddenly be a &#8216;diversity rainbow&rsquo; might seem incongruent.</p>
<p>I mean, when they had a black Vulcan in the Star Trek series, &#8220;Voyager&#8221; (which also had a female commander, very PC it was) it seemed so odd.  I don&rsquo;t mind if the human characters are of different races, because that&rsquo;s what we are, but for aliens to mirror human diversity - I mean, how would any Vulcans develop as blacks?  Are there Asian vulcans too?  Spock and all the other vulcans until that series were white!</p>
<p>This &#8220;Naz&#8221; person could be cast as a Wood Elf though, as the Hobbit book has the wood elves being darker than the regular elves of Elrond&rsquo;s kingdom. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it when movies based on European culture have to have black, brown and asian characters thrown in.  Non-whites complain when whites are cast as them in plays and movies.  We should also have the same consideration.</p>
<p>Recently there was a production of a Shakespeare play, and the king of England was played by a black man.  I mean, how far can this go?  Should we do a remake of Roots and have Kunta Kinte played by Justin Bieber?</p>

		<p>Multiculturalists have been frothing at the mouth over the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> films&rsquo; awful Whiteness for years.  I&rsquo;m inclined to wonder if this trumped-up incident isn&rsquo;t the start of a governmedia campaign to make sure <i>The Hobbit</i> is packed with the usual brown quota-fillers.</p>
<p>If Jackson gives in on this one, I won&rsquo;t be watching <i>The Hobbit,</i> in 3-D or any other way.<br>

		<p>One of the things I loved about Lord of the Rings was the lack of conspicuous non-white actors.  Tolkien wove his stories from a Northern European perspective, incorporating ideas from Norse and Celtic mythology.  His Hobbits, Wizards, Dwarfs and men are White, obviously.  </p>
<p>Please tell me The Hobbit won&rsquo;t have ridiculous multiracial casting!  I won&rsquo;t even see it if they have a bunch of non-whites prancing around the Shire.  Why doesn&rsquo;t this whiny woman go try out for a Pakistani film?  <br>

		<p>Many years ago, I went to a pricey period production of Charles Dickens&rsquo; A Christmas Carol at the esteemed Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.  They cast a dark-skinned black as the child of a white couple in Victorian England!  A party scene also featured several chunky black women as fetching lasses, waltzing around the stage with white men.  It was revolting and insulting, and I never went back to that theater.  </p>
<p>These absurd castings never improve a production, they just distract from the story and insult the audience for the benefit of non-whites (who probably won&rsquo;t by tickets anyway).  I&rsquo;ve stopped paying to see anything that panders to minorities. </p>
<p>Liberals are always going on about &#8220;cultural imperialism&#8221; and whites &#8220;co-opting narratives&#8221; from non-whites.  But we&rsquo;re the only people who aren&rsquo;t allowed to tell our own stories without demands to include inappropriate non-whites.  Try to force blacks into Asian roles in Pakistan and see how far that gets you!  <br>

		<p>Sure, let&rsquo;s have a Hobbit movie with brown hobbits. Right after that we can have a 5th century Japanese movie with whites and Africans running around.</p>
<p>The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are based on books that were essentially designed to be a Dark Ages British/European folk-tales. It was supposed to be Tolkien&rsquo;s contribution towards the mythological history he felt that Britain lacked. So, no, Pakistanis don&rsquo;t belong.</p>

		<p><i>Ms Humphreys, a social policy researcher, said: &lsquo;I would love to be an extra.</i></p>
<p>BINGO! I was wondering what her beef was. And there it is. After all, auditioning to be an extra really is a cattle call. I&rsquo;ve done it a couple of times myself. You stand in line for a couple of hours and if you fit the profile of what they&rsquo;re looking for you get picked. One time they might be looking for white folks to play hobbits. Next time they might be looking for tanned folks to play amerindians. It&rsquo;s the way it goes. But she&rsquo;s a &#8220;social policty researcher&#8221; and so she used this to make a stink.</p>

		<p>Well, she&rsquo;s not, and the casting agent is correct.</p>
<p>Hobbits (as J.R.R. Tolkien wrote) were archetypes for pre-WWII BRITAIN.</p>
<p>Last time I checked, a Pakistani and a Brit were not interchangeable cogs, or cultures; much to the consternation of the &#8216;One World Types&rsquo;, we Anglo-Saxons tend to recognize who and what we are.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>

		<p>I have been waiting for this or something like it. A movie, particularly a popular one simply cannot be permitted to retain its all white cast. Whites engaging and defeating the forces of darkness without the assistance of the rainbow brigade? Not possible, does not fit the narrative, will not be permitted .  Look for more on this.</p>

  Casting for extra&rsquo;s is all about type. If you were casting Zulu Warriors for instance would it be wrong to reject a blonde person.<br>
       As a professional actor myself I often don&rsquo;t even get to see the casting director because I&rsquo;m either too old,too young, too fat, too thin(well never that unfortunatly).<br>
    I just get on with it because I havn&rsquo;t got a race card to play</p>

		<p>I bet this woman went into this audition with the hope that she would be turned down. She got the desired reaction (because she knows she is obviously not suited for a role) and is now able to engage her race campaign against the producers. These Lord of the Ring films have been very upsetting to non-whites since they came out and they have been trying to malign them for quite some time. </p>

		<p>Remember when they were going to cast black actor Jaime Foxx as Frank Sinatra?  Thankfully, that was too far even for modern America.  The Italians threw a fit and studio research predicted that NO ONE would pay to see that debacle.  </p>

<p><i>But Foxx has emerged as surprise favourite to play the singing legend &mdash; who died 11 years ago aged 82 &mdash; in the biopic directed by Martin Scorsese, 66.</i><br>

		<p>Even in the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; movie, Merry, Pippin and Frodo did not look much like Hobbits, I was disappointed.  Hobbits of course are much shorter than a regular human, have chubby faces and red cheeks, they have brown hair, are not skinny, well fed would describe them, not fat, but well fed.  and they have furry feet. She does not look like a hobbit at all. She needs to read the book, maybe she won&rsquo;t get such a stupid idea into her head. <br>
But then, we watched a video of Robin Hood, and did you know one of his brave men was a black? I wonder where he came from. <br>

		<p>I used to wonder which, among being smart vs. being pretty, is evolutionarily the most useful at continuing a given gene line?</p>
<p>I just refelt that vibe when reading the blonde hair extension article and now again, here.</p>
<p>I like to look at pretty things that make me believe in the power of dreams enough to pursue them.  I have money to pay for that experience.  Is that not enough?</p>
<p>I wonder if those who control our sordid lives realize how deep a trough they are dredging when they remove the cultural as racial sanity of our fantasy worlds as a social safety valve.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, I just have to ask:  If &#8216;beiges&rsquo; (like she&rsquo;s considering redecorating a house, did you notice?) are so evil and browns/blacks/yellows so &#8216;hip and enlightened&rsquo;, why does no one want to star in brown/black/yellow stories?  Why are these stories never brought to film?</p>
<p>I hope Hellyweird drowns in the acid pit they are digging for themselves.  What&rsquo;s more, I hope they are too poor to pay a brown hand to pull them out.  This &#8216;beige&rsquo; will never give them one.</p>
<p>Hollywood being one of California&rsquo;s few remaining &#8216;embarrassingly white&rsquo; institutions didn&rsquo;tcha know?</p>

		<p>Thay should have rejected her on some other grounds or not have given a reason for rejecting at all. White people are too honest for their own good and do not know how to play the game. Other races are racists too but use false excuses to justify their racism.</p>

		<p>Let Jamie  Foxx (and why two Xs in the name anyway?) play Frank Sinatra, as long as John Goodman can do Howling Wolf. I think Goodman would make a good Howling Wolf, actually.<br>
 <br>
 Whenever blacks think their culture is being hijacked they make the most terrible fuss and not one  white spokesperson dare open their mouths. As has been  mentioned with the Angelina  Jolie film.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it if it wasnt for whites there would be no electronic visual art as there  would  be nothing with which to record it and the blacks would be sitting in dirt to this day watching shadow puppet shows. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m white, if I try out for a role as MLK or Malcom X and don&rsquo;t get it can I sue? Grow up, it&rsquo;s a casting call, do all actors get every role they try out for?? That would be a big NO!</p>

		<p>Tolkien&rsquo;s Shire is his beloved Worcestershire which he knew as a boy before WW1, and the hobbits are the &#8220;little people of England&#8221; (as represented by the rural folk of Worcestershire) who no-one notices until it&rsquo;s too late - as Sauron discovered to his ruin.<br>
 So it should be unthinkable and absurd to cast any non-white person as a hobbit but I fear it will be done: a BBC series for children featuring Merlin and set in fifth century Britain has a mulatta Guinevere and blacks and orientals among the background characters.</p>
