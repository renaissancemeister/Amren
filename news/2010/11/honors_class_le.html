<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the most racially mixed high schools in Illinois, Evanston has a mission of embracing diversity and promoting equity and excellence for all students. But its own data show that few minority students make it into the school&rsquo;s most rigorous courses that will best prepare them for college and the future.</p>
<p>Honors classrooms dominated by white students have been common in Illinois and across the nation, a byproduct of a century-old and controversial tradition of tracking, or sorting, students into different levels of classes.</p>
<p>Across the Chicago region, high school officials say they are making inroads in diversifying their advanced classes, but Evanston is considering the boldest step of all: eliminating an elite honors English course that has traditionally been offered to the highest-achieving incoming freshmen  &mdash;  usually white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the most part, freshmen of all races and socioeconomic and achievement backgrounds would learn together in the same freshman humanities class, an English course that blends literature, history, art, music and philosophy and is required for graduation. The class would be taught at the honors level, according to district officials, and all students would have the opportunity to earn honors credit depending on their grades on assignments.</p>
<p>The superachievers  &mdash;  freshmen who outscore about 95 percent of their peers nationally on eighth-grade achievement tests  &mdash;  would no longer have their own class, beginning next fall. A year later, the same approach would be taken with freshman biology classes, if the school board approves the proposal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m excited about moving away from racially segregated classes,&#8221; he [Superintendent Eric Withersp] said at a packed school board meeting earlier this week, adding that all freshmen should be taking challenging courses that will propel them to even more rigorous classes as upperclassmen.</p>
<p>Applause broke out in some, but not all, parts of the mostly white audience.<br>

<p>Nearly white schools promote diversity too. And what a coincidence, The nations blackest school systems, black as the the sky as night, they make it a mission to embrace diversity, promote equity, foster excellence and celebrate diversity - but to an even greater degree. Another coincidence, by &#8216;embrace diversity&rsquo;, promote equity, foster excellence and celebrate diversity, they also mean promote non-whites, raise their racial consciousness, blame any of their problems on whites and their &#8216;racist&rsquo; societies, and celebrate themselves and their nakedly racist efforts.   </p>

		<p>A racially mixed school is nothing more than a school in transition to becoming majority nonwhite.</p>
<p>Where, oh where, did Eric Witherspoon send his own kids? Not at Evanston, you can count on that. </p>
<p>My prediction for 2020: expect Evanston Township High School to be nearly all minority, and it will be ranked as low as any high school in America called Martin Luther King High School.<br>

		<p>Brainless, culture deprived people should not be in honors or AP classes. Nor should they be admitted to any colleges that try to maintain very high academic standards. Regrettably, more and more colleges are glorified ghetto high schools. So Jamal can go to college even if he can&rsquo;t go to St Johns (Annapolis) or the Clarement Colleges. The fact is that the US college degree is the equivalent of soile toilet paper, with a few honorable exceptions. So let em all in. This nation doesn&rsquo;t even know what the purpose of university education is anymore.</p>

		<p><i>Honors classrooms dominated by white students have been common in Illinois and across the nation, a byproduct of a century-old and controversial tradition of tracking, or sorting, students into different levels of classes.</i></p>
<p>Except that tracking hardly exists anymore.  It&rsquo;s not that some central mastermind is plucking any ole white student out of the normal course into the honors course at random   &mdash;   The whites in the honors courses are there because they have demonstrated the skills to absorb an advanced curriculum.  </p>
<p>This is happening in Evanston, Illinois, one of the kookiest white cities around.  It was either this or another Chicago suburb that banned handguns then later on had to undo the ban because all the black thugs from Chicago were invading the city&rsquo;s houses because they know they&rsquo;d have easy victims.</p>

He&rsquo;s white and probably feels as if abusing white kids in favor of appeasing blacks will help his illustrious career.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about watching you help dumb down your school to the black level of incompetence, MISTER Witherspoon.</p>
<p>Any white who has the means to home school his kids or who has the means to move to another district should do so at all costs.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for the white kids who are being punished for being more intelligent and white.</p>

<p>When you start from a unbridgeable contradiction (promoting diversity AND excellence), you&rsquo;re doomed to fail.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about moving away from racially segregated classes,&rdquo; he [Superintendent Eric Withersp] said at a packed school board meeting earlier this week, adding that all freshmen should be taking challenging courses that will propel them to even more rigorous classes as upperclassmen.</i></p>
<p>Just wait until &#8220;THE GAP&#8221; appears in integrated rigorous classes. Superintendent Withersp won&rsquo;t be as &#8216;excited&rsquo; when he&rsquo;s being crucified for failing to educate everyone equally.</p>
<p>The white kids may be celebrating now but more than a few of them are going to see the realities of race in the classroom. The same teacher, the same lessons, the same textbooks with radically different test scores. They will see blacks resent them and openly attack them for doing better. The brighter white kids will catch on and change their views accordingly.</p>
<p>Racial awareness is born of racial experience.<br>

<p>Of course he&rsquo;s &#8220;excited!&#8221; Problem is, these classes are not segregated by &#8220;race,&#8221; they are segregated by ability and achievement! Once again, as is usually the case in these matters, White students are asked to dumb it down in order to promote the social doctrine of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; What a disgrace&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Racially segregated?  Being sorted by achievement and ability is not racial segregation.  That the outcome of the sorting process is not politically correct and racially balanced is not the fault of the process.  And did you notice the not so subtle phrases &#8220;century old&#8221; and &#8220;controversial&#8221; to describe the sorting/tracking?<br>
Meaning it&rsquo;s outdated, and it needs to be scrapped.  This will happen more and more, excellence will be eliminated in the name of social equality.  Your free tax funded education comes with a terrible price, mediocrity.</p>

		<p>Our government school systems have dramatically lowered the absolute number of students scoring very high on the Verbal SAT over the past four decades. E. D. Hirsch, Jr. (who wrote the 1987 best seller, Cultural Literacy: What Every American Should Know), referring to a chart showing the average Verbal SAT score falling about 40 points from 1967 - 2002 said this: </p>
<p>&#8220;The absolute number of students who scored above 600 declined by 56 percent and the absolute number of students who scored above 650 declined by 73 percent.  A sudden influx of black and Hispanic test-takers cannot explain why large numbers of college-bound middle-class white students suddenly became less proficient.  That is what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>The corruption of an already mediocre curriculum [particularly at the K-8 level] over that period probably for much the decline in verbal ability.  Evanston High School may, however, pioneer another potent means of driving down white language proficiency.</p>

		<p>These halfway gestures are a waste of time. The achievement gap won&rsquo;t be closed for good until the White children are lobotomized. At the parents&rsquo; discretion, they could also be given massive daily doses of PCP starting in kindergarten. </p>
<p>True equality will require bold initiatives. But I&rsquo;m sure we can count on heroes like Superintendent Witherspoon to make the necessary sacrifices.</p>

<p>Seriously, it won&rsquo;t take more than two weeks for the white kids to realize they have a huge problem on their hands.  They were used to reading a lot of thick books, writing long papers, debating topics and critical analysis and synthesizing disparate information.</p>
<p>Now they will find that the teacher, flustered by DeQuan&rsquo;s yelling, Shamika&rsquo;s constant head rolling and ghetto fabulous ways and the general lack of ability of half the class, will start assigning &#8216;group projects&rsquo; in which &#8216;all members&rsquo; will have a &#8216;role.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>1) Time Keeper, 2) Facilitator, 3) drawing artist, 4) internet &#8216;researcher,&rsquo; 5) coordinator, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>The groups will produce really great posterboards full of big pictures, little snippets of cut-and-pasted text, big titles, and lots of glitter and glue and bold colors drawn with markers.</p>
<p>Matthew, Lisa and Michelle will wind up doing all the work in their groups, while Moniqua, Tarell, Taquanda and Diego goof off, play with their phones under the table or shuk and jive.</p>
<p>The group will get an &#8220;A+&#8221; and everyone will get good report cards and earn their credits towards graduation.  </p>
<p>&#8216;Project-based learning&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t created for nothing!</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Achievement Gap&rsquo; is closing!&#8221; the talking heads will cry, but in reality all the kids will lose. The white kids, however, will lose the most.  I know of what I speak with great amounts of firsthand experience.  Another suburb will soon be lost as the whites begin to realize what&rsquo;s happened and move away.</p>

		<p>Evanston has a long history as a home for ivory tower liberal Whites.  Many work at Northwestern University and have attempted to remake the town in their &#8220;no such thing as a bad diverse person&#8221; image.</p>
<p>Students and townspeople are regularly attacked by Africans from the west side of town who prey on these very dunderheads.  Evanston Township High School was once an excellent place to obtain an education.  As the school has darkened in the last few decades, concession after concession has been made to placate the rowdy Africans.</p>
<p>This is but the latest surrender and will have the same effect as the others: little by little, Whites who aren&rsquo;t disingenuous libs will leave.</p>

		<p>It is amazing that double speak is used here. &#8220;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about moving away from racially segregated classes.&#8221;  This is intended to send out the message that the blacks are not allowed to attend the whites-only classes and yet the problem is according to the report that they just cannot qualify.  More Marxist socialist dumbing-down of the curriculum to the lowest levels.  We have seen this in the UK where a teacher is being noted for a very recent written report where the statement was made &#8220;We must all work &#8220;arder&#8221;.  It started with the teachers when they were at school and now it is spreading.<br>

<p>Sounds like he&rsquo;s preparing students for a lifetime of double-speak. The most important skill of all in integrated America. Shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for them, they&rsquo;re high achievers.</p>
<p>This is the first i&rsquo;ve heard of test scores/standards being at the root of racial segregation. What a bizarre admission. Perhaps he&rsquo;s just so used to treating white kids as racial oppressors - that for what a normal person might seem parody, is in his eyes yet another bold leap away from oppression. Those darn smart kids foisting segregation on us&hellip; He&rsquo;s been dealing in double-speak for so long (and if a minority himself - been so humored) double-speak and unreality is all he knows. </p>

<p>I predict that high achieving students will leave this school and move to ones that haven&rsquo;t watered down their curriculum.</p>

		<p>Just another reason to get your kids out of public school! I was in advanced classes from about 2nd grade until high school and knew that there were students in them that should not have been there. In a couple of cases a sibling of a deserving student was admitted and it was felt that the other sibling would feel &#8220;left out&#8221; if she were not admitted as well. In other situations it was more than obvious that the kids were there as &#8220;diversity&#8221; admissions. Being that I attended mostly white schools and there were always a couple of blacks in the class with me (there were never really more than a handful of blacks in my school to begin with)I graduated in 1990 so this sort of garbage was going on even in the early 1980&rsquo;s. Schools are more and more becoming social experiments that are dumbed to the lowest common denominator rather than developing the gifted students. </p>

Makes me wonder just how many Whites did applaud. I will wager very few to say the least. For shame on those Whites that did applaud!</p>
<p> As for the groveling diversity pimp, Superintendent Withersp, (what kind of last name is that anyway). Is he even a White man?</p>
<p>Of course the high achieving Whites have to give up their class to bow down to the diversity freaks. How much longer Whitey?, will you be a doormat to the nonwhite hordes, that have invaded YOUR own land? </p>
<p> Not to mention imbeciles like this Superintendent who go along with the self-destruction of America and of the White race. He sounds like a true Alinsky commie.  </p>

<p>Most of the achieving Whites will end up going to private schools, which still believe in excellence, even though most of these schools seem to be Christian. But as these private schools get bigger, their Christianity will morph into Liberalism, leading to the same problems. </p>
<p>If the bright Whites don&rsquo;t get out of Evanston public schools, they will be bored out of their minds, and zone out, drawing unicorns or warriors on their notebook paper, leading to THEIR DEMISE, all in the name of equality!</p>
<p>Especially the bright MALES, who are already in a difficult position, due to the fact that they are treated just like the females (everyone is equal!). Now, the cancer spreads.</p>
<p>But their are those of us who DON&rsquo;T think that excellence is bad, who have a deserved PRIDE in their heritage and abilities, who DON&rsquo;T think that the poor in abilities and intellect are blessed and that we, the able, should therefore sell all our abilities, distribute them to the poor and unable, and then enter into the multicult kingdom, thereby inheriting eternal dismal life in an African village!</p>

<p>  &mdash;  Whiteraven</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the PC reign of terror that has descended on the educational system, abusing White children is, if one wants to advance or keep his job, <i>de rigueur.</i></p>
<p>May an especially hot corner of hell be reserved for sell-out Whites like witherspoon, useful idiot Whites who engage in the destruction of Whites and White Civilization, have sold their souls for short-term gains for themselves. </p>
<p><i>At the parents&rsquo; discretion, they could also be given massive daily doses of PCP starting in kindergarten.</i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re given massive doses of Ritalin these days, turning them into zoned-out zombies, starting in grade K, at the strong suggestion of school psychologists, principals, teachers and nurses <i>a lot of them.</i>  </p>
<p><i>Yet, I don&rsquo;t see any programs out there to increase the percentage of whites in AP classes.</i></p>
<p>Thuy</p>
<p>Because we Whites, unlike Asians, are <b>not allowed</b> to form advocacy groups for our own people.  Any such attempt is soundly denounced by the media and government as a &#8216;Rise of Nazism/White Supremacy/White Oppression&rsquo;  our jobs and reputation are threatened, effectively shutting us up.</p>
<p>You see, we Whites, unlike you Asians, have the government&rsquo;s boot on our necks, a government that is avidly promoting out demise and destruction.</p>
<p><i>This is an atrocity!</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Anon #18</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ll second that.  It&rsquo;s an atrocity that our bright White children are being stifled and held back.  It is an atrocity that we are satanically taxed to pay for an educational system that is blatantly, racially biased against our own children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an atrocity that Whites are portrayed in K-12 academia as responsible for ALL evil in the world, past, present and future, ALL colonialism, genocide, poverty and misery   &mdash;   and by the media as murderers, racists, fools and buffoons in need of guidance and correction by non-Whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an atrocity that we have No Voice against an arrogant, racist government, that our Constitution is being torn asunder and that openly anti-White policies such as racial preferences trump ability and achievement everywhere.</p>
<p>So few know what is going on inside the schools, about the blatant anti-White, anti-Western Civilization curricula and policies that are in place   &mdash;   policies that inhibit or forbid celebrating White traditions and holidays, portray Western Civilization as an abomination and elevate and assign White achievements to non-Whites.</p>
<p>Useful Idiot Non-Whites are being primed for genocide against Whites, and I believe they&rsquo;ll do it, gladly, when they get the chance, when we are a dis-armed, neutered, drugged-out, broke, hated minority.</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>If you want to know what goes on inside a lot of classrooms these days, what passes for &#8216;rigorous curricula&rsquo;,  re-read Jay&rsquo;s excellent post.  </p>

<p>Everyone, please make sure you read Jay&rsquo;s full post about &#8220;group projects&#8221;.  This is the teaching method that is taught in Ed Schools all over the country and pushed on traditional classrooms.  It&rsquo;s common in Elementary schools all over the country, even in majority-white areas.  </p>
<p>The socialized learning is spreading up the grade ladder, too, with Junior Highs and High Schools desperately trying to &#8220;engage&#8221; unintelligent students.  The Whites and Asians end up doing the work for their group, but it&rsquo;s usually make-work projects that don&rsquo;t teach them the skills they need.  </p>
<p>If you visit a class room and see it furnished with only a few big tables, or the desks all pushed together in groups of 4, then individual work almost never happens.  This is done because it&rsquo;s a &#8220;friendly&#8221; way of slowing down the White students so the blacks and hispanics can keep up.  If White parents and students object, they&rsquo;re told that &#8220;team-work and social skills&#8221; are just as important as reading, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me?  A relative told her Principal that she felt guilty that her White students weren&rsquo;t learning ANYTHING in 5th grade, unlike their peers in better schools, and the black female Principal told her, <b>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry about them, they can catch up later.&#8221;</b>  That is an exact quote!  (The school is about 1/2 white and 1/2 hispanic with a handful of blacks)</p>
<p>Get your kids out of public schools!<br>

		<p>The illogic of this is simple:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The superachievers &mdash; freshmen who outscore about 95 percent of their peers nationally on eighth-grade achievement tests &mdash; would no longer have their own class, beginning next fall. A year later, the same approach would be taken with freshman biology classes, if the school board approves the proposal.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>If the class isn&rsquo;t a threat, then blacks and hispanics should simply be assigned to it in greater numbers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about moving away from racially segregated classes,&rdquo; he [Superintendent Eric Withersp] said at a packed school board meeting earlier this week, adding that all freshmen should be taking challenging courses that will propel them to even more rigorous classes as upperclassmen.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>If these new classes are more challenging than the one you just eliminated then why embrace it as an act of diversity and not one of elevating intelligence -regardless of color-?</p>
<p>At which point it becomes clear that verbal skills = conceptual skills and undeveloped conceptual skills = sheep population who drinks down the Kool Aid of whatever they are told.</p>
<p>By infinitely corrupting present white society while eliminating their followons as a race, &#8216;they&rsquo; who really rule this country, if not the world, are ensuring there is no dissent, no intelligent debate against, _whatever comes next_.</p>
<p>I think this is really the hallmark signature of something we should have deduced a long time ago.  Someone, somewhere, doesn&rsquo;t think like we do.  Doesn&rsquo;t see themselves as they see us.</p>
<p>And are smart enough to instigate this campaign of internal, social, self destruction against us so that it is not because they are -stupid- that they refuse to share our values.</p>
<p>These &#8216;others&rsquo; who, as a class, own 97% of global assets while maintaining 10% of our elite population.  What if this exceptional small group AGREE with what we do and are destroying us because it IS the truth?</p>
<p>What if they aren&rsquo;t human?  It would certainly explain a lot of the negative stimulus to undertake genetic research.  To determine what exactly is different between us.  If one of &#8216;us&rsquo; was not &#8216;us&rsquo; at all.</p>
<p>Someone with a lot of genetics of biology class horsepower under their pate needs to look at this from a speciation point of view.  Has enough time gone by for a separate predator culture to have genetically separated from our parent species?</p>
<p>Someone who understands epigenetics well enough to tell us also what will happen when the chief white advantage which CENTURIES of history have illustrated through art, science, engineering, architecture, politics and philosophy, to be conceptually enabled by verbal symbolism, is no longer present as a generational reinforcement in activating and selecting certain gene groups.</p>
<p>I think that there is more to this blatant sabotage than meets the eyes here.  Much, Much, More.</p>

I thought about the weak dollar on the international market, and stories like these are exactly why the dollar is so weak   &mdash;   Since the dollar is purely based on confidence, and not any hard metal, then the dollar&rsquo;s value is based on the world market&rsquo;s esteem of the United States and its economy.

<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s doing just the opposite.  An organization is true to its principles.  If you were the CEO of Coca-Cola, you wouldn&rsquo;t want a person merely to drink one can of Coke every day   &mdash;   More like a six-pack every day.  If you were a street dorner dope dealer, you would get your customers hooked on the &#8220;good stuff,&#8221; then gradually fleece their pockets by &#8220;cutting&#8221; (debasing) the hits you sell them more and more, while charging them the same price per hit.</p>
<p>Apply that logic to education   &mdash;   Anyone who works in the education industry is obviously going to encourage you to get as much education as possible.  Not just one can of Coke a day, but a whole six-pack a day.  And likewise, why wouldn&rsquo;t they debase/cut a given level of education in order to compel you to keep getting more and more (and more importantly, paying more and more) in order to get the same level of &#8220;dope&#8221; (actual education) but spread out over several &#8220;hits&#8221; (levels of matriculation)?  If college today is worth high school of fifty years ago, then of course those who run a high school have every incentive to turn their high school into a glorified elementary school.  A side benefit on top of that is that the more you &#8220;cut the dope,&#8221; so to speak, the easier it is for blacks and Hispanics to pass and for that &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; to disappear.</p>

		<p>Nothing new here.  I went to community college in the 90&rsquo;s, and again in the late 2000&rsquo;s when I went back for my medical degree. </p>
<p>In the 1990&rsquo;s community colleges in my area has accepted a dumbing down in classes such as sociology, psychology, and even English. At that time science classes were still science classes, and math was still math. When I went back in the late 2000&rsquo;s to knock out a few prerequisites that were too old for my medical school to accept, history had been rewritten as diversity history, and my physics classes were severely dumbed down. Calculus was still calculus, algebra was still algebra, but physics had been turned into an extra credit opportunity to pass those whom could not pass under ANY circumstances in a physics class I had a mere 10 years earlier. </p>
<p>None of this surprises me. The only thing that does surprise me is that medical schools, and other major universities still willingly accept those credits as equivalent, and consider GPAs from them as equivalent.      </p>
<p>It was only a matter of time for this to filter to the high school level. </p>
