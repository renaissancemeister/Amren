			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Abby Sewell, Los Angeles Times, November 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Proponents of a California initiative modeled after Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law may begin gathering signatures to place the measure on the ballot in 2012, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The measure would require state and local law enforcement officers to investigate the immigration status of anyone they lawfully stop and &#8220;reasonably&#8221; suspect may be in the country illegally. It would also make it a crime for illegal immigrants to seek work while concealing their legal status and for employers to &#8220;intentionally or negligently&#8221; hire them.</p>
<p>Initiative proponent Michael Erickson would need to collect signatures from 433,971 registered voters by April 21, 2011, to qualify it for the ballot. If it is validated, the measure could be placed before voters in February or June of 2012.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unlike the Arizona law, the California proposal specifies that law enforcement officers must verify immigration status &#8220;in a timely manner at the scene of the stop or detainment&#8221; and may only do so through information provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal agencies.</p>
<p>Erickson said the proponents decided to introduce an initiative in California before the Arizona legal battle had run its course in part because they were concerned about the spillover effects of the Arizona law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fiscal review of the proposed measure by the state&rsquo;s legislative analyst and finance director noted that it could lead to &#8220;potentially significant cost savings&#8221; in government services provided to illegal immigrants. But the analysis also pointed out that the measure could lead to tens of millions of dollars in increased costs to the criminal justice system to arrest, prosecute and detain migrants.</p>

		<p>Just what is needed, but I would be concerned for the safety of anyone gathering signatures to put this on the ballot if they were to do it in areas with large numbers of illegal aliens, (which is about half that state at least). There are so many White hating Mexicans in the Golden State that those with the petitions should be on guard against verbal tirades, possibly getting spat on or even assaulted.</p>

		<p>Oh, yeah.  Like that&rsquo;ll pass.  I heard somewhere that California did in fact pass a tough law against illegal immigrants some years back, but that was probably back when California was majority-white.  And I&rsquo;m sure it passed by the slimmest of margins.  And of course the courts over-ruled the initiative, as they always do.</p>
<p>But we must be optimistic, and trust that God will find a way to right every wrong.  Somehow, I can sense this ballot will pass.  How?  I don&rsquo;t know.  But I feel it will.</p>

		<p>In the unlikely event it would be passed into law the corrupt courts would overturn it.  </p>
<p>California will completely self destruct.  I only hope the rest of the country won&rsquo;t have to bail it out.</p>

		<p>Prediction:  </p>
<p>The referendum will pass with a huge majority and then quickly overturned in the CA activist courts and quickly confirmed in the federal appeals court in the loony-tunes Ninth Circuit.   This is what happened with Prop. 187.</p>

<p>No need for any additional expense.  If all the freebies are cut off, and doors slammed in the faces of illegals at any turn, they will deport themselves.  Problem solved.  However, in order for this to work, it would require politicians show some balls, and that is highly unlikely.</p>

		<p>Passing measures like this, or even having to discuss them, shows how far we&rsquo;ve fallen, how weak the  dispossessed majority have become,  how the USA is crumbling beneath our feet.</p>
<p>Now, we are reduced to desperate measures of passing laws to enforce other laws that aren&rsquo;t being enforced. And the government is against the people!</p>
<p>None of this should even be necessary. Nor even debatable.  In a healthy country, it would all be automatic. It would be taken for granted. </p>
<p>It was that way once. In the Eisenhower 50&rsquo;s, they were deported without any internal fuss. It was not even an issue. I can remember it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal&#8221; means against the law. Period!  What&rsquo;s hard to understand about that?</p>

		<p>I think the situation in California is reaching the point of no return which is why I think voters will vote overwhelmingly in favor of this law.  White voters are still 65 percent of the electorate in California but it won&rsquo;t stay that way forever.  </p>

		<p>If this initiative ever gets before the voters and passes, expect the will of the people to be annuled by the courts. That&rsquo;s what happened to Prop 187 which would have gone a long way in preventing the state from becoming the horrible meixfornicated mess that it is today. And for those of you who need a re-cap, foreign-born Peter Schey, the son of a Jewish communist, got Mariana Pflazer, a liberal Carter appointed judge, to issue a indefinite injuntion against it. Then ex democratic govenor Grey Davis, who assured the public that he would allow the measure to make it way through the courts despite being opposed to it, conspired with the Mexican president to have it destroyed behind closed doors. Meanwhile, the liberal media has concocted and promoted the myth that prop 187 killed the Republicans in CA. What killed the GOP was the flooding of that once great state with millions of government dependant third-worlders and the subsequent out flow of millions of Americans. </p>

		<p>California is the first of the 50 states to admit it is over 50% minority. The liberals should be jumping for joy. California with it&rsquo;s balmy weather, incredible tourist industry, the seat of the entertainment industry and the incredible riches in agriculture and just about every other venue known to modern civilization  &mdash;  is sinking under the dead weight of invaders. How&rsquo;s that working out for you? Seems not too well, but we know you won&rsquo;t do what needs to be done to fix it, so California, once the crown jewel of America will be forever lost. There&rsquo;s not one chance in a hundred that this law will pass, or if it somehow passes, the courts will simply overturn it completely. Any white people left living in the former state of California had better sell their land for whatever they can get from it and pull up stakes and move. (Not that any of the other states are much better&hellip;)</p>

<p>True. So sign the petition with your P.O. Box address, or your Mail Boxes etc.address. </p>
<p>Cops on duty, when asked their address from irate members of Society, always give their Headquarters or Precinct addresses, so you should give your business address, if you don&rsquo;t have a P.O. Box. </p>

		<p>WE had plenty of these initiatives in the past. I would personally send in 40-50 signatures and the local radio station would tell people to download them and fill them out and send them out.</p>
<p>I realized they were simply a gimmick of the California Republican party. When you mailed them in there was always their soon to follow requests for money along with new petitions. I can&rsquo;t believe we never never got 600,000 signatures needed to get a bill amending the California Constitution on the ballot. I suspect this is the same trick.<br>

		<p>Anon #12&rsquo;s post shows in-depth knowledge of the fate of Proposition 187.  It ought to be reread. It is the best encapsulization of the demise of Prop 187 I have seen.  I would add that a response to Judge Phaelzer&rsquo;s ruling on Prop 187 is well worth a listen:</p>
<p>&#8220;Power is not given to you. You have to take it. Remember, 187 is the last gasp of white America in California. Understand that.&#8221; (Art Torres, then the soon-to-be chairman of the California Democratic Party speaking to a Chicano audience in 1995: One-minute Real-Audio clip, 5th item at the link):<br>
