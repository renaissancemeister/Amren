		<p>What can you say, it is an unfortunate sign of the times. I have also noticed that many Afro Serviceman do do good with the white women so there is some truth in advertising, again unfortunately.</p>
<p>White female/black male couplings seem to be the hot thing internationally in advertising (though to be fair in the U.S. it is not uncommon to see White Male/Asian Female couplings although the emphasis on unbridled jungle lust is not the same as with BM/WF ads.) Here are some international ads, don&rsquo;t click if you have a weak stomach:</p>

<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/26nv7mz" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/26nv7mz</a></p>
<p>And of course you have the E Channel which constantly promotes WF/BM pairings-The Kardashians plus the former Hef &#8220;Girlfriend&#8221; Kendra and a new twin &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; who stars in a video with her black lover. </p>

		<p>The military has really caved into PC indoctrination and it keeps getting worse. Interracial mixing, gays, speech codes, and the list goes on.  Doesn&rsquo;t the White people ever see these types of stories or do they only listen/watch the alphabet channels on TV? I can only see most Whites as being clueless or in complete apathy when it comes to race. Talk radio is just as bad.</p>

		<p>Having been in the US military for nearly 20 years I can tell you that this attitude is par for the course. White men in this country&rsquo;s military bear the brunt of every task and take up all the slack of the &#8220;under-represented&#8221; demographics. </p>
<p>All the while Equal Opportunity and Diversity Focus Groups make heroes out of heathens in order to paint the modern military as some sort of multi-cultural paradise. </p>
<p>The unfortunate fact is that the US military is now a place whee the race-card is carte blanche, having a period gets you a 30-hour work week, and more &#8220;Brown Pride&#8221; tattoos than the average prison are pretty much uniform of the day. <br>
Now as a cherry on top, there&rsquo;s this poster encouraging White women to inter-breed with whatever hoop-shooting, pants-sagging, would-be felon happens to ask her &#8220;what up.&#8221; </p>
<p>White military men, already being passed over for promotions while being the only reliable soldiers and sailors that can be saddled with the hardest jobs, are now being propagandized as undesirable for reproduction.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not genocide I don&rsquo;t know what is.  </p>

		<p>Although the picture shows a White female/Black male, there are a number of White men in the militray who date and have married Black and Hispanic women.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, the poster is promoting European women chasing African men.  Which is what people mean when they say &#8220;mixed,&#8221; generally.  Which is what the media is trying to promote.  Not Asian women chasing African men, not Asian women chasing European men, not European women chasing Asian men, not African women chasing European men, not not African women chasing Asian men, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty specific, what they want to promote; African men as suitable and acceptable and desirable partners for European women.</p>
<p>That said, what an ugly couple.</p>

		<p>I have long seen the military as mostly a communist system with uniforms and grades.  Lots and lots of mischief goes on that no one can even begin to unravel.  But as illustrated here, they represent a huge part of the influence to miscegnate, just as if a Marxist was running the program.</p>
<p>How they can produce a poster like this when there is so much rape going on between these two groups nearly stupifies the imagination.  But they got the order from somewhere and they produced it.  &#8220;Be all that you can be, baby!&#8221;</p>

		<p>My brother-in-law is a Navy Recruiter.  He told me that white men in the Army are referred to as &#8220;bullett-bags&#8221;.  I was horrified.  But he was being blunt because he was trying to talk a nephew into going to College and joining the Navy as an officer but to avoid the Army at all costs.  We are being exterminated through both miscengination and execution.  And it is being done by white politicians.  </p>

		<p>The poster promotes genocide of Whites.  This is because most of our genes are recessive. This means it takes a White male and a White female to have a White child.</p>
<p>Look, this race mixing society is not our society. Race mixers are not out people.  We have to leave this society and circle our own wagons  &mdash;  we who believe this way. </p>
<p>Until we can physically do this, we must keep our own counsel within the belly of the genocidal beast, and we must shun race mixers.</p>

		<p>This poster should also indicate that this poor girl will be abused, raped, infected with STD&rsquo;s, impregnated, and abandoned. There simply is no &#8220;safe sex&#8221; of the variety advertised here. NASA&rsquo;s main objective is to &#8220;reach out&#8221; to the Muslim hordes and apparently the main objective of the Navy is to promote the abuse of blonde women. Despicable. </p>

		<p>The obvious solution would be for whites to avoid the military completely.  Boycott it!  But our enemies have already preempted us - they have crippled the economy so badly that many whites see no other option; they simply cannot find jobs in the private sector.  Pervasive anti-white discrimination makes it even worse.</p>

		<p>This poster is a good example that shows not all whores work the streets.  Some women will do anything for money.  </p>
<p>During my time in the military I realized the US military is little more than a glorified welfare system, and has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with protecting our country.  And, with that welfare system, you get low-class people.  Most lifers in the military are not there because they are patriotic citizens, giving their all for their country.  It is a gravy train, job security, a guaranteed paycheck.  They can sit on their butts, and kiss butts, and still get a paycheck.  The military was one of the biggest disappointments of my life, especially when I saw what I saw.  I would not encourage anyone to go into the military.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a Navy ad and the black guy is in military drab. Is it a warning to black Navy men not to have unprotected sex with white women?</p>

		<p>This inter-racial propaganda is typical of what the U.S. has devolved into, to wit: a system of state sponsored dysgenics. Young White females pursuing a &#8220;career&#8221; in the military soon degenerates into race-mixing and a miserable life of breeding down.</p>

		<p>this is nuts and very foolish.  encouraging the most inferior genes mixing with superior genes = diaster.  this is exactly what happened in ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, Aryans (of India)= collapse of the advanced civilization.  and now this is encouraged in the Western World.  Hopefully, interbreeding with inferior genes will not happen in China/Japan but they do look up to the US and might follow suit.</p>

		<p>Yeah it&rsquo;s absurd. One time I got a flier in the mail for a sale at JC Penney&rsquo;s. And in it was a black guy in swim trunks carrying a surfboard with a white female in a bikini, I guess it was trying to sell swimwear. What a stooopid ad. I have been to the beach in California countless times and can&rsquo;t recall having ever seen a black surfer, so the near impossible scenario is obviously some sort of political correctness agenda, but all it did for me was insult my intelligence to the point I almost wanted to send them a letter telling them how dumb they look for printing the ad.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that the United States Navy would promote a photo like this.  It is quite apparent that they too have a race-mixing agenda.  It is so blatantly obvious as to be ridiculous.  </p>
<p>The most commonly displayed social-engineering image is White women with Black men, especially BLOND-HAIRED WHITE WOMEN.  We see it all the time in the media, be it newspapers, magazines, periodicals, TV, movies, Companies Internet sites.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that there are forces attempting to rid the world of White people through miscegenation.  This disgusting ad is something that we might see on a porno site, and this is THE UNITED STATES NAVY!!!  What more evidence does one need that there are forces acting to destroy us.</p>

		<p>WPVI Channel 6 Action News in Philadelphia uses these child like drawings during their weather forecast as a guide as to how to dress the kids for school. The most frequent is one dipicting a little Black Boy holding the hand of a little blonde White girl.<br>
I remember that Benneton consistently used interracial images. The Italians seem to be fascinated with Blacks. It was most frequently BM on WF.</p>
<p>I remember in my last year of High School I dated a pretty little Blonde girl of English/Irish heritage. One evening as I sat on her front porch, her mother came out and in no uncertain terms advised me that I was not to call on her daughter anymore because she wanted her daughter to associate with boys of her own race. I&rsquo;m of 3/4 Italian heritage. My mother was half Irish and my Dad was all Italian. This was back in the sixties and I was hurt to think that someone didn&rsquo;t consider Italians as being White. I made no attempt to ingratiate myself with the mother by telling her of my Irish heritage. <br>
I very quietly and with dignity thanked her for letting me know her feelings and that it would have been a unfortunate should  my relationship with her daughter develop into something permanent leaving me with an ignoramus like her for a mother-in-law. I left her with her mouth hanging open.<br>
I used to fantasize about walking past her house someday and seeing her daughter sitting there with a Bantu.</p>

		<p>I work with the military and find that White women seem to join the military and experiment with black males, it of course NEVER works out. I also see a tremendous number of black officers now, especially black women officers who are routinely incompetent and it is VERY difficult to deal with them when they mostly have their big chief mentality, they are recalcitrant, combative and argumentative in everything to include fields such as electricians and power generation which deal with LETHAL VOLTAGE and they (blacks) don&rsquo;t seem to understand the word LETHAL! I would like to demonstrate the word to quite a number of them as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>What you speak of is a small minority of AR readers at best - yes, they do exist, but are hardly representative of most to whom race-mixing is race-mixing&hellip;period! </p>
<p>Moving on, I have noticed an absolute glut of these race-mixing propaganda ads, commercials, etc. in the past several years. Perhaps capitalizing on the(ever more fleeting)popularity of the Mulatto Messia Obama, it seems the propaganda machine shifted into overdrive around the time of his election and hasn&rsquo;t slowed at bit. And the phenomenon is international as various recent articles here and elsewhere have proven. </p>
<p>The hatred of the White race seems to be reaching a fever-pitch anymore. And the movement to simply breed us out of existence seems to be a favored tactic. And in some ways, disgracefully enough, it has been quite successful. </p>

		<p>This propaganda poster has changed my mind on a key issue: I no longer think overt* homosexuality in the U.S. military is undesirable. If the U.S. military encourages black on white sexual activity, allowing overt homosexuality would have no significant impact on its combat effectiveness. </p>

		<p>I see no way to save the United States.  Liberalism has won. To me this picture represents America today, take a good look folks because as this picture indicates, things are just not right in this country.  Since whites will not vote as a block because they are afraid to be labeled &#8220;racists&#8221;, since we have self-destructed ourselves religiously and morally, since we have opened our doors to undesirable immigration, since our education system through high school level graduates people who in many cases can barely read and write, since the Federal Reserve has to create more worthless money just to keep things moving now which ensures poverty-level living for our kids and grandkids in the future, since we are now supposed to report gun ownership on income tax returns (thank you democrats), and since we are economically doomed because of the Asians are eating our lunch while we continue with our welfare and over-spending problems, I believe the collapse of the nation is imminent.  A stock market crash will lead the way.</p>
<p>I think it is impossible for us to ever be what we were in the past as a people.  Individuals should immediately take actions to protect themselves from what is soon coming.</p>

We need to go back to the days when it was looked down upon and not associate with any of them. As long as we all appear accepting of these types of unions we are only promoting more of it.</p>

I&rsquo;m only one person and I&rsquo;ve gotten companies to stop running race mixing ads that were running over and over. If enough of us did this we could stop these ads. </p>

		<p>Note the extraordinary differences in the shapes of the heads: the facial angles, the protrusion of the chin.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have double chins like whites do - who has noticed this? Due to their facial angle being on average 15 degrees or so off of the white average, black chins tend to join the neck in an upward slope, where for whites the tip of the chin  usually slopes down to the meeting point on the neck. </p>
<p>Not that that&rsquo;s necessarily relevant (a disculpatory disclaimer as images of evil Nazis with measuring devices hovering over terrified Jewish subjects spring to mind). </p>
<p>What is relevant is that this - and several other like-minded propaganda race-mixing pieces (like those linked above by S &amp; GS) are so nauseating, so wrong, they just scream for correction. </p>

		<p>Even more laughable is this definition of &ldquo;healthy sexuality&rdquo; by Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center, in the above linked text of the policy. It reads: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Definition: Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I like the line about, &ldquo;&hellip;free of coercion, discrimination and violence.&rdquo; Just what do these multicultural people think they are promoting in the poster. By promoting racial genocide of whites in the absence of sexual discrimination, violence and coercion are the tools of their Marxist trade here.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to speculate here, as I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I strongly suspect that many of those politicians (just like us) have deep, secret misgivings about this - uh - &#8220;program&#8221; that has taken us over without a vote or discussion and has become virtually our new national religion.  There is only one permissible point of view.</p>
<p>The media masters and opinion makers have established this policy as the virtuous and moral &#8220;thing to do&#8221;, and they censor out all objections to the contrary.  Or worse, they brand objectors as knuckledragging  klansmen and nazis and mentally deranged moral monsters who should be shunned by all decent people.  </p>
<p>Thus, no  half-way respectable politician who desires a career dares to go against the official establishment view. And so, they put a smile on their face and they endorse the decadence. There is simply no other position allowed. Not for &#8220;respectable&#8221; people, at least. The alternative is professional suicide.</p>
<p>Likewise for educators and all public figures who want to have careers.   They must toe the line.  Or else.  Such is the degree of mental strangulation that the Frankfurt School and their allies  have gained over all our crucial institutions.  </p>
<p>It reminds me very much of the story of the &#8220;Emperor&rsquo;s Clothes&#8221;. Everyone feels compelled to oooh and ah over the Emperor&rsquo;s splendid new finery   &mdash;    and nobody dares to speak the truth that the Emperor is naked!</p>
<p>Humans are herd animals.  Most people will huddle with the group and follow the consensus. Those few who refuse to follow the herd, disagree  at their own risk and are viewed as heretics. When some shrewd person or group gains control of the opinion-making apparatus, that puts them in a position to determine what the crowd will think and, ultimately, which way the nation will go.  </p>
<p>We are the few who see clearly. It is up to us to scream at the top of our voices that this Emperor has no clothes!</p>

I guess I am getting older. I can remember another time, another moral standard.</p>
<p>The  &#8220;old fashioned&#8221; idea of continence, chastity, and <i>sex within marriage</i>  seems to be completely forgotten today.  All that&rsquo;s passé.   Now, it&rsquo;s &#8220;anything goes&#8221;.  If it feels good, do it.  Go girl! Do your thing!  And black is beautiful.</p>
<p>I could add that marriage itself is being re-defined. Once, it was about establishing a home and family. The whole purpose of marriage was, above all, about <i>children,  </i>and about providing the next generation.  Now, it&rsquo;s about getting the maximum social security benefits, health care,  and tax reductions.  (The next generation can be provided by immigrants. Who wants the bother?  After all, all races are the same anyway, aren&rsquo;t they?)</p>

		<p>As late as 1920, the official position of the American military was that, exact quote:</p>
<p><i>Sexual intercourse is not necessary to preserve health and manly vigor.  The natural sexual impulse can be kept under control by avoiding associations, conversations, and thoughts of a lewd character.</i></p>

<p>I think you are talking to me?  I will assume that and clarify a bit anyway.  I grew up in an Air Force base dominated town in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s.  Many members of the enlisted were people from poor regions of the country who saw a great opportunity for free stuff, as well as a job.  I used to feel some resentment when the military kids talked about all the stuff they got at the BX and how little they paid for it all.  Free medical, dental, etc., not to mention a sort of arrogance they portrayed because they had been stationed in Europe somewhere.  Most of them were pretty wild compared to those of us who were permanent community members.  Also, I know of a number of cases, one my best childhood friend who, when he was about 17, was getting a lot of tickets for speeding around.  The judge finally told him to join up.  He joined the Navy, served in Vietnam, and came back a heroin addict.  Draft boards were not egalitarian until the lottery was established.  As Steve Earl wrote in his song, &#8220;Copperhead Road,&#8221; &#8220;I volunteered for the Army on my birthday.  They draft the White Trash first &#8216;round here, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Previous to the lottery system that came into use toward the end of the Vietnam War, committees made up of community members sat on the local draft boards and discussed who to send and who not to send.   Even then, prominent, powerful, people could get favors for their sons, as HW Bush got for GW Bush. </p>
<p>The problem I mentioned about the Marxist effect appparent in the military today started due to the exponential growth of the Military/Industrial Complex that Eisenhower warned the nation about in the 1950s.  It has taken a long time to get to this point.  The eradication of seperate services for the sexes due to Feminism was a major contributor to what we see today as well.  Even so, my nephew who served in the Navy from 1988 to 1994, said that many women actually prostituted on ship when at sea.  Any moron could have predicted that.  Armed Forces service as a replacement for a full welfare state is a huge reality.  In fact, it has become a state within a state.  </p>

		<p>A bit off subject.</p>
<p>I was sitting having lunch in a CostCo recently and a woman, obviously of a grandmother&rsquo;s age came in with an off-White boy of about 3-4 yrs old. A little later another woman about the same age came in and sat down nearby with a White boy about the same age. You could see the hurt on the face of the woman with the off-White boy when they started playing together. She envied the other woman so much for her wonderful looking White grandson. I wondered if the woman with the halfcaste boy was the guardian of the boy, or just watching him while the mother worked. Many times, people just bring the child home to their parents and dump the child and leave. That&rsquo;s not to say White children aren&rsquo;t dumped ont their granparents, but for the most part, it seems the women who have these mixed race children do it far more often than White women with White children. At least, that&rsquo;s what I see in my church. Granparents raising children. It&rsquo;s a big problem not many people are aware of.</p>

<p>The show does everything it can to promote interracial sex, dating, homosexuality, teacher/student relationships etc&hellip; and other retrograde ideas.</p>
<p>It is a sad state of affairs.  </p>

<p>I have noticed the same thing, although I could never quite put my finger on exactly what the look of discomfort was in the grandparent&rsquo;s face.  It must be disappointment.  Imagine your daughter giving birth and never being able to say (about the grandchild) &#8220;oh, he has greatgranddad&rsquo;s eyes or Aunt Mabel&rsquo;s red hair.  Sad.</p>

		<p>What is most interesting is that: the media, academia, big business, and our &ldquo;government&rdquo; feel compelled to promote race mixing in such posters and other advertisements. It is as if they know it as unnatural as any sane person cuddling with a boa constrictor or alligator, as if these creatures were puppies or kittens.</p>
<p>And there is the answer to all this propaganda my friends, they know it is abnormal and most normal people (aside from the: impressionable young, naïve, stupid, unbalanced, or outright evil) are revolted by it. The fact of the matter is, in everyday life I see very little of such parings. I would say for every single mixed couple (or a sub-vile single white &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; lugging about her unprofitable products of genetic treason) I see 75 to 100 that are not so &ldquo;progressive.&rdquo; On an even more positive note, I see very few single white parents on the weekends, period; ironically, the few that I do see are of the little white strumpet lost type and their equally abandoned hybrid offspring. That is one thing the propaganda of Big Brother and Co., very rarely shows in their genocidal nonsense, the subsequent hopeless future of such white girls. No matter how pretty and smart you are &ldquo;princess,&rdquo; once you are stuck with your &ldquo;baby daddy&rsquo;s&rdquo; little castoff, your stock in the dating and mating game just went from 100 to 0 in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>How interesting is it, that in this &ldquo;Studio Brussel&rdquo; video originally provided above by S &amp; GS:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2f7ez7e" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2f7ez7e</a><br>
  <br>
The first line of the hip-hop caterwauling in the video is: &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t want to think no more, they just want to feel, they want to let go.&rdquo;  That isn&rsquo;t what most people want in the general public however, as man is a thinking being that moderates his feelings with his cognitive processes. This is only what the multicultural elites are hoping for and why they are so feverishly pushing this interracial debauchery, since those that only feel with unrestrained and thoughtless abandon, are so much easier to dominate and exploit. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I admit my ignorance of public relations and advertising, but that poster makes no sense to me. If there is a need for diversity in an advertisement, this topic (in my opinion) would be it. Why not show a diverse group: white, black, yellow, brown; male, female, indeterminate; young, middle aged? All would be in uniform and appearing to be intelligently curious. This would stress that STD&rsquo;s are a concern for all naval personnel, not just black men and their girl friends. But I know little about PR and advertising, and less about the motives of the FedGov.</p>

&#8216;As usual, white woman/black male-does one ever wonder whether the Jews, who definitely shun between their own mixed race relations,pushing their Marxist agenda on the Gentile white race to effectively eliminate it, are destroying White,Western cultural morals/values for the Jew Soros&rsquo; One World Socialist Government?&#8221;</p>
<p>Soros is a Communist from the word go and his religion has long been left behind as it is with most Jews who have those leanings. His being a Jew has nothing to do with it. If anything Jews being the entrepreneurial people that they are, Communism should be anathema to them. Fidel Castro, Stalin, Ulianov (Lenin), Mao, Ho Chi Minh, MLK were/are all non- Jews.</p>

		<p>Yes the obvious issues are all here but the real danger lies just beneath the surface.  The manipulation of the US mil services should have us all afraid, very afraid.  In large measure, the remants of a majority white male establishment, the services, are keeping the US and much of the free world, free.  As it becomes more and more difficult for white males to achieve rank, we are disturbingly close to gutting the brains of the services.  Not only discipline suffers but the time-honored leadership advantage Americans have always had is fast disappearing.  Our enemies are well aware of this.  Don&rsquo;t worry, the Chinese plan is to strike when we will have become the weakest, that information that is floating around the intel boys has it pegged between 2020 and 2030.  By then, this old war horse will have succumbed to creaking joints and a broken heart.  We should be eternally sad for ruining our children&rsquo;s future though.</p>

If you watch TV advertisements on youtube which promotes race mixing -of course ALL of them are a black man and a white woman- in nearly all of them the best rated comments are anti-race-mixing.</p>
<p>And even better, most comments seem to be from young whites.</p>

<p>I totally agree! Too much time is spent obsessing about Homosexuals ( I personally think that &#8220;gay&#8221; is a silly word but I&rsquo;ll use it because I&rsquo;m too lazy to write out homosexual each time) and Jews which serves only to divert our attention from the real enemy. My personal interest has been amd always will be the future of my children and grandchildren that is daily being threatened by the forces of evil who apparently are seeking to destroy us as a race and as a culture. <br>
I think that some &#8220;gay&#8221; activists have put people off by trying to portray themselves as some sort of separate ethnicity. WHite people be they Gays, Straights or non-Leftist Jews are all in the proverbial same boat and whether the Progressives or the Muslims take over, we are all goners.<br>
It&rsquo;s time to close ranks and to lock and load.</p>

I notice more of them lately. Well, there are always various points of view. Some are just insensitive, others ignorant. Others merely tactless.  Ignore them. And of course there will always be provocateurs who have a motive in driving away as many sympathizers as possible, in any way possible.</p>
<p>Since Amren censors so many posts, I am surprised it allows theirs to be printed.  Does Amren really want supporters?<br>
Not terribly much, it would appear, when it allows friendly persons to be insulted and driven off.  (And they claim  that insults &#8220;of groups or individuals&#8221; are not allowed here, but they encourage &#8220;polite debate&#8221;.)</p>

Then just keep reading here and you will learn. That poster makes plenty of sense to the government. And we understand it too.</p>
<p>You ask, &#8220;Why not show a diverse group, not just black men and their [white] girlfriends?&#8221;  Because this black/white mix is exactly what the Fed Gov is pushing! The consistency of this propaganda is glaring when you become aware and take note of it. </p>
<p>They are not interested in presenting a purely random assortment of people, without reference to race.  If that were the case, blacks would constitute only 12% of the faces in the photos, with Asians etc. even fewer, instead of being always  out front and center.  And white males would be featured prominently, instead of always being way in the background   &mdash;   if even in the picture at all.  Everything pushes &#8220;minorities&#8221;. Furthermore, the statistical likelihood of black men being paired with white women would be even smaller. </p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t leave this to chance. They present it the way they WANT it to be. Racial awareness underlies everything. This poster is not just about STD&rsquo;s; it has a secondary purpose as well. </p>

<p> The bottom line is that this is essentially saying:  it is perfectly acceptable to replace that white woman&rsquo;s potentially all-white off-spring with some brown-skinned mutt who will give his allegiance to everything that&rsquo;s anti-European and anti-Conservative.  Complete national suicide.  </p>
<p>The one &#8220;good thing&#8221; I&rsquo;m starting to believe is that since whites are too weak to do much about it, nature eventually will.  &#8220;Black&#8221; Americans are now 20% white, on average.  So in another 500 years or so, &#8220;blacks&#8221; should be all white.  </p>

You could say (in loose terms), <i>&#8220;their race is their religion&#8221;. </i>  For anyone else, that would be decried as &#8220;racism&#8221;; but being a persecuted minority, they are exempted from the general rules. Christianity, Islam, and all other large religions seek to be universal. Judaism is the reverse. Judaism is for Jews.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t seek converts and actually discourage them (some sects within Judaism don&rsquo;t recognize converts at all).</p>
<p>Indeed, most Jews (at least those I have known) are non-religious. They are very conscious of being Jewish, however.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of this race mixing while I was in the military and there two reasons why it is happening.</p>
<p>First, the average black man&rsquo;s lower IQ and ASFAB test scores will ultimately land them in the administrative field that has been traditionally held by women (sorry females no bad intended) . So during all of their training courses and then their permanent assignment, they will be surrounded by black men (very few white male recruits will go into Admin). Most white men score higher and then go into either the electronics or mechanical fields. In most on-base nightclubs you will see single white women surrounded by 5 black men at almost every table.</p>
<p>Second, these women thrive on the constant attention that may of never been afforded them back in their hometown. Once they are away from family and friends that may be critical of them, they just go wild and forget any morals that they may of learned..    <br>
