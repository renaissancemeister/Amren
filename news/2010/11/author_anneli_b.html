			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yolandi Groenewald and Tarryn Harbour, Mail and Guardian (Cape Town), November 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asked by Rapport newspaper to name the people she doesn&rsquo;t like, she paused for a few seconds and answered: &#8220;Black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those words have opened a can of worms for Botes, probably the most popular present-day Afrikaans woman writer. This week Die Burger Oos fired her as a columnist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to back pedal over my comments. It&rsquo;s the truth,&#8221; she told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend of mine had a saying: sometimes you chop wood and you don&rsquo;t consider where the splinters will land.&#8221; But she added hastily: &#8220;Maybe it was impulsive .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and maybe it&rsquo;s unfair to put all black people under one umbrella. Naturally, there are a lot of black people that I like very much. But I certainly meant what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she had received about 1 000 emails supporting her comments.</p>
<p>Botes won the 2010 K Sello Duiker Memorial Literary award earlier this month in the Afrikaans section for her novel, Thula-thula, which deals with child abuse and incest. With an age restriction of 18, the work has sold more than 34,000 copies.</p>
<p>Her publisher, Tafelberg, an imprint of NB Publishers, distanced itself from her remarks. &#8220;We believe that all our authors are entitled to their own views. In this case the publisher does not share the author&rsquo;s view,&#8221; NBP&rsquo;s Riana Barnard said.</p>
<p><b>The reasons</b></p>
<p>Crime lies at the heart of Botes&rsquo;s racial paranoia. &#8220;I&rsquo;m scared,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In my daily life there&rsquo;s no one else that I feel threatened by except black people. If a courier comes to my door and he&rsquo;s white, coloured or Indian, I&rsquo;d have no problem inviting him in for a glass of water. But I would feel threatened by a black man.&#8221; Botes said she would also never appoint a black gardener.</p>
<p>She said that two years ago her laptop containing a manuscript was stolen while she was asleep. She woke up when a torch flashed across her face. A neighbour was murdered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell me what the face of crime is in South Africa. If you hear the window shatter and confront the perpetrator, who do you expect that crook to be?&#8221; she asked. What about trying to conquer racial stereotypes?</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t have the means to get my head around that of a black man,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t understand that. As a writer, I write what I see, what I experience and put it into context. It isn&rsquo;t my job to be politically correct.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Moving along</b></p>
<p>She and her husband are planning to move to England as soon as he goes on pension. Her children already live there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here in Port Elizabeth, I wouldn&rsquo;t go to a deserted beach alone. It&rsquo;s simply too dangerous. The English villages where my kids live don&rsquo;t even have streetlights and I would walk there in the middle of the night without fear,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just last week I read a piece about an 84-year-old woman attacked in her house in Durbanville. I don&rsquo;t want to be 84 years old and attacked in South Africa in my walker. I want emotional freedom, freedom from fear. That&rsquo;s very important to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Botes is not the first Afrikaans celebrity in the past few months to get involved in a race row. Last month Afrikaans singer and daughter of Bles Bridges, Sunette Bridges, wrote on her Facebook page: &#8220;Of all the instruments that is needed to build straight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a sjambok is the only one that works for this Groenie of mine. Eish.&#8221; &#8220;Groenie&#8221; or &#8220;Groenewald&#8221; is a _racist term for blacks.</p>
<p>Comments on Rapport&rsquo;s website showed that while some readers supported Botes&rsquo; comments, hers was not the only viewpoint.</p>
<p>Alida wrote: &#8220;You have no idea how disrespectful you are. Beneath the veil of honesty and wit, you are offensive, loveless and quite unjust towards your fellow citizens. The sooner you emigrate, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>François wrote: &#8220;Pack your bag and get lost, South Africa doesn&rsquo;t need people like you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. People who suck South Africa dry of its money and resources and then drag our country&rsquo;s good name through the mud overseas .&#8221;</p>
<p>Noted Barbara: &#8220;Please don&rsquo;t include me when you say &#8216;all white people are like this&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m proud to say I&rsquo;m definitely not like you. Talent, unfortunately, can&rsquo;t make up for being common.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Good for her!  What I don&rsquo;t get is why ask questions that you don&rsquo;t want an honest answer to?  And her fear and dislike is based on statistical fact.  Too bad blacks and their nit wit supporters never say &#8220;yes, black crime is worrisome, perhaps we (or they) should start acting civilized&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Sounds familiar, and I&rsquo;ve never been to South Africa. It&rsquo;s a poor way to live when one has to always assess their vulnerability when being out and about, day or night. That she&rsquo;s come to resent that fact is very understandable. Blurting it out and then standing by what she said is very refreshing.</p>

		<p>SA blacks should wise up. They can cause the same fear and chaos without resorting to physical violence. </p>
<p>Perhaps, though, the initial phase of violence and murder is necessary to smoothly get to the next phase where it isn&rsquo;t usually necessary&hellip; who would I be, a white man, to say for sure?</p>

<p>Racial paranoia, a mental malady unique to whites.</p>
<p>Of course, the M&G; doesn&rsquo;t want to delve into the racial reality of black crime which promotes this racial paranoia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad she said what she said. Let&rsquo;s hope she continues to stand by her remarks.<br>

<p>And being sycophantic with blacks is not going to guarantee you one iota of safety.  You&rsquo;re fresh meat to them the same as any white.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help thinking that the PC crowd in every country is motivated by fear in their responses more than anything else.  Cowards and do-gooders are the bane of whites.</p>
<p>In an all-white society, comments like this courageous writer makes would be very common.  </p>
<p>If I bring the subject up in private, most every white I talk to about black pathologies and the trouble they cause is in full agreement, even though some of them start out by saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not prejudiced&hellip;but&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&#8221;  And the youg ones are oftentimes the most vehement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with the subject of low black intelligence. I got into an argument with a black county supervisor over requirements for burning permits, and he was unable to understand what I was referring to, among other things.  He was stupid, and I told his white, female co-worker exactly that before I left, and I added that he had to have been given his position solely because he was black.  She replied, &#8220;I know exactly what you mean, but I can&rsquo;t say anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most whites are very careful of what they say in the open, especially at work, but get them warmed up to the subject in private, and their true feelings aren&rsquo;t any different than the people on this site.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of buried rage out there.  When it finally comes out, there will be Hell to pay for blacks.  </p>

<p>This would be a wise move for Anneli Botes and her husband if England was the way it was in say, 1955.  But today England is a police state and the biggest Enemies of the State are not Islamic terrorists but white race realists who tell the truth about racial differences.</p>

		<p>Of course all blacks are not murderers but most violent crime is committed by blacks,most hijackings are committed by blacks. I have lost ten friends and acquaintances who have been murdered by blacks but  none by whites or Indians. If my vehicle broke down on the road I would fear being attacked by blacks and that is what most whites fear even if they don&rsquo;t admit it. That is why I now live in New Zealand even though I miss the country of my birth which I and my ancestors helped build. My Grandfather was a young man during the Anglo/Zulu war of 1879 when the Zulu wore nothing but skins and fought with spears and had neither hospitals nor schools and could of course not read or write.Who developed the country? They have these trappings of civilasation but so many are still trapped in their primitive violent  past.</p>

		<p>I support her.  If that is how she feels, perhaps they should be asking her why.  &#8220;Why&#8221; is never asked.  They shut people up with accusations of racism.  </p>
<p>If diversity/multiculturalism is so wonderful, why do they have to enforce it with a police state?<br>

		<p>The authors pose the question &#8220;What about trying to conquer racial stereotypes?&#8221;  </p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s up to those that are stereotyped to conquer (or rise above) stereotypes.  Stereotypes exist for a reason.  It isn&rsquo;t feasible, or even possible, to meet and greet every single person that exists within a particular category.</p>
<p>In statistics, you take a sample of the population, then draw a conclusion based on your data.  If you could survey every single person there would be no need to interpret the data.  Since that&rsquo;s impossible, you have to make assumptions of the population based on your sample.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s no substitute for real-world experience.  When I go to the beach and someone tells me there are an abundance of sharks in that particular location, I&rsquo;m going to avoid that particular location.  I know logically that there are hundreds of species of sharks that are not man-eaters and even the ones that are, don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy human flesh.  But why take the chance?</p>
<p>Similarly, in a city population where there is an abundance of crime and not too coincidentally, there are an abundance of Blacks, I know that the majority of the Black population isn&rsquo;t (or hasn&rsquo;t) committing crime.  But again, why take the chance?  The simple fact is that there is a great preponderance of crime in Black areas than there is in White areas.  </p>
<p>Unless there is some pressing need for me to be in an area where there are an abundance of Blacks, I simply avoid going there.</p>

		<p>Amrenners must please keep in mind that the comments on the original article are manipulated and moderated.</p>
<p>We white South Africans do not have a single printed medium that speaks for us - we have no voice. The journalists are in general of the leftist type - thus the hatchet job done on this poor soul. This newspapers belongs to the Naspers group, which belongs to Johnnic, which in turn is controlled by the ANC. This is also the reason for the mis/disinformation dished out on a daily basis by those in the media who would rather kiss the ANC&rsquo;s feet than me labelled as racist.</p>

		<p>Finally someone who isn&rsquo;t afraid to speak and who is a high profile figure.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s probably going to be o.k. in a small village in Britain, but I wouldn&rsquo;t advise her to settle in one of its large cities full of third world rabble.  If she does she&rsquo;ll not improve her situation much.</p>
<p>Likewise, I wouldn&rsquo;t advise her to settle anywhere near an urban area in the US like Camden, N.J. or Newark.  Newark is being forced to cut its police force to the bone, because of a lack of funds to pay them.  That has occurred in several cities around the country and will occur in more and more urban areas as time goes by.</p>
<p>Consider this headline on Drudge:</p>

		<p>The comments by readers on main stream media web pages, e.g. www.news24.co.za, are getting more and more biased against so called &#8216;complainers&rsquo; about the conditions of South Africa. And these include not only blacks, but more and more what seem to be younger whites.  </p>
<p>Emigrants are being attacked as being disloyal, must shut up, are complainers and unpatriotic, stuck in the past, black haters, etc. Few arguments are based on statistics or web links. It sounds like in the old Soviet Russia where any opposing voice was silenced, only it is done in a more subtle way and just enough critical voices get through in order to prevent any accusation of censorship, but the pattern is there.</p>
<p>Now the comments sections are being tightened up by blocking anonymous comments in the name of a &#8216;modernization drive&rsquo;: <a href="http://www.news24.com/MyNews24/YourStory/New-comments-on-News24-20101108" rel="nofollow">http://www.news24.com/MyNews24/YourStory/New-comments-on-News24-20101108</a> and quite a few comments recommend these moves (planted comments?).</p>
<p>Is this psy-ops? And there are quite few web pages that push the positives about South Africa and any contrary views, except some silly ones, are ruthlessly edited out. For example <a href="http://www.homecomingrevolution.co.za/" rel="nofollow">http://www.homecomingrevolution.co.za</a> <a href="http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/</a><br>
and some smaller websites which most likely do not have such a major impact but one wonders about their motives<br>
<a href="http://sarocks.co.za/" rel="nofollow">http://sarocks.co.za/</a> <a href="http://shutupwhitey.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://shutupwhitey.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>It is disconcerting how many seemingly white people defend this system at all costs in the comments. The younger generation underwent our new school curriculum which just teaches liberal history (like it seems to be in the USA). One does not know how many of these comments are &#8216;planted&rsquo;, they seem to be so unreal, sometimes downright uneducated and junior school like, compared to when meeting people in real life.</p>
<p>I myself have tried posting with web links and statistics from official government sources - ones comment will be posted once, thereafter a flood of accusations are posted and any counterargument from my side will not be posted.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels that some of these websites want to lure South African emigrants back to South Africa with false promises. Some emigrants seem to have forgotten after a few years what conditions are like over here, and their beliefs are reinforced by these websites.</p>
<p>We know that South Africa is experiencing a skills shortage. But why lure people here when there is BEE? It is like talent fishing, throw the misses to the wolves and the hits get employed after testing them carefully on their views. When people get into job troubles due to the global crisis they will return to South Africa and lie just to secure a job. </p>

		<p>stereotypes and generalizations do have their important functions. First of all, the attacks against the use of such is blurred, they want us to believe that having an opinion is as serious as a judgement in court. Which it isnt, even if many people enough starts using these stereotypes, it becomes less attractive to be a part of that group. And then its working, its active campaigning against that type. So, stereotypes and generaliszations are of the simplest manner that groups do respond and try change eachother.</p>
