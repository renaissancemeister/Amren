			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Donna Bryson, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), November 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mawethu Mguli and hundreds of other workers at the gold mine in Orkney have gone months without pay at a time when gold is going for around $1,400 an ounce.</p>
<p>After the mine&rsquo;s previous owners went bankrupt, the workers expected that a new partnership  &mdash;  headed by relatives of Nelson Mandela and President Jacob Zuma  &mdash;  would get operations back on track when it took over last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Africa sees getting its vast mineral wealth out of the ground as vital to creating desperately needed jobs, fueling growth and redressing the economic ravages of apartheid. But a toxic combination of a crumbling infrastructure, mismanagement and the specter of nationalization is frustrating the drive to improve and expand the country&rsquo;s mines. Some are asking whether political connections mean more than competence in an industry that is a pillar of South Africa&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>South Africa is the world&rsquo;s richest mining country in terms of its reserves, according to a Citibank estimate that valued its mineral resources at $2.5 trillion. It is a major producer of diamonds and gold, and has major reserves of less sexy but still lucrative minerals like platinum.</p>
<p>Mining has accounted for an average of 7.7 percent of South Africa&rsquo;s gross domestic product over the last decade, according to the Chamber of Mines, an industry trade group.</p>
<p>Half the country&rsquo;s merchandise exports were mining products in 2009, when the industry employed half a million people. Another half million worked in fields dependent on the mines in this country with a population of 50 million where at least a quarter of the work force is unemployed.</p>
<p>Yet, during a global boom in commodities prices from 2001 to 2008, other countries with major mining operations outperformed South Africa, according to the chamber, whose members include such industry giants as Anglo American and DeBeers. The world&rsquo;s top 20 mining countries saw mining GDP grow at an average of 5 percent a year during the period, while South Africa&rsquo;s mining sector GDP dropped by 1 percent a year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s mining infrastructure  &mdash;  from the power plants needed to get the ore to the surface, to the roads and rail lines to get it to market  &mdash;  is tattered. Talk of nationalizing mines in some political circles has spooked foreign investors. And questions about corruption among the civil servants became so heated that in August the country&rsquo;s mining minister imposed a six-month ban on the issuing of prospecting licenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mining Minister Susan Shabangu told reporters recently she is working with other government departments to address infrastructure problems, including an energy shortfall that just a few years ago forced gold and platinum mines to suspend production because of lack of power. Eskom, the state-owned electricity company, blamed years of under-investment and rising demand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shabangu says that while nationalization is not government policy, her African National Congress party is studying its feasibility. The issue is being pushed by Julius Malema, the vocal and populist leader of the ANC&rsquo;s youth league.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nkosi, the former Chamber of Mines head, calls nationalization an &#8220;antiquated and discredited practice&#8221; that has impoverished African and other countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shabangu said inspectors found some companies had fraudulently claimed significant black ownership to qualify for licenses under so-called black economic empowerment rules established to give opportunities to South Africans discriminated against under apartheid. Other companies got licenses even though they were bankrupt. Inspectors conducting the audit were threatened or offered bribes  &mdash;  when they could find company officials to speak with at all.</p>
<p>Shabangu said black economic empowerment companies are a special concern, and that some are &#8220;clueless&#8221; about mining. She said the most widespread problem is companies never embarking on the search for minerals for which they have been granted licenses.</p>
<p>Mining is closely associated with apartheid  &mdash;  it was the industry, after all, of the migrant labor system that tore men from their families across southern Africa, creating a legacy of broken homes that persists today. For many, mining still epitomizes the apartheid equation of white power and black poverty.</p>
<p>Sandile Nogxina, the top civil servant in Shabangu&rsquo;s department, told The Associated Press that the government is pursuing two goals: ensuring the industry grows, and ensuring blacks benefit from that growth.</p>

<p>OK - that made me laugh out loud!  South African blacks have &#8220;broken families&#8221; because of apartheid-era mining practices?  What is the excuse for the other countries in Sub-Sahara Africa?  How did that affect the &#8220;African Diaspora&#8221;, AKA blacks in every other country in the world, all of which are especially prone to &#8220;broken families&#8221;?  </p>
<p>When Black Africans did have European-style nuclear families with strong black husband/father/provider/role-models?  I thought &#8220;it takes a village&#8221;&hellip;of wandering matrilineal polygamists!<br>

		<p>Hey anti-Apartheid American liberals. How do you feel about the Black ruled country you helped create? Nice, huh?</p>
<p>South Africa is the world&rsquo;s leader in A.I.D.S., child rape; adult rape; murder and political corruption.</p>
<p>Many of the White farmers who haven&rsquo;t been slaughtered or ran off their land in the government&rsquo;s &#8220;voluntary&#8221; land grab will soon be re-locating to Georgia, which will undoubtedly lead to massive food shortages in your Rainbow World.</p>
<p>Civil war, starvation, cannibalism and total dependency on Whitey handouts are in South Africa&rsquo;s near future. Which country would you liberals like to fix next? </p>

<p>Well, there you go, proof positive!  It&rsquo;s all the Legacy of Apartheid&rsquo;s fault.  You didn&rsquo;t seriously think the <i>blacks themselves</i> could possibly bear any responsibility for this failure, did you? </p>
<p>Thank you so much, Donna Bryson, for letting us know the official party line on what we are to think.  Having to draw our own conclusions might have led us into forbidden thoughts.</p>

It&rsquo;s the machinations of the black mind that makes them believe that what they SEE the white man do is easy and something they could do if only given the chance (which they aren&rsquo;t because of racism).</p>
<p>Blacks look at a businessman in a suit or a doctor or scientist in a smock or engineer holding designs of complex machines and systems and they believe that that&rsquo;s all it takes; LOOKING like successful businessmen, scientists, and engineers is all it really takes. </p>
<p>So a black man sees a white man in a business suit running a successful business and he believes it&rsquo;s the suit, the persona, the position itself, that is the key to success; just put a black man, any black man in the same suit and let him run the same business and he too will be successful.</p>
<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t comprehend the complexities and intricacies of advanced western civilizations but they BELIEVE all it takes is BEING in the position that makes you a success.</p>
<p>Blacks always see things backwards. They believe if you make them an engineer, they&rsquo;ll simply be an engineer. That don&rsquo;t see that you have to have the capacity to do the work that makes you a success.</p>
<p>You see the same thing when black complain about their kids not being in advanced courses. They think the advanced courses are what make you smart, not that being smart makes you able to handle advance courses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the African mind that believes in totems and Ju-Ju.</p>

		<p>Let me correct you on the issue that &#8220;apartheid&#8221; was to blame for what the mining industry did to black families: The mines all belong to Anglo-American, in other words, it belongs to the Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers. They wanted cheap labour, so they recruited blacks all over the southern african region. It was in these mines that the mixed black language Fanagalo came into existence due to the intermingling of the different tribes. There was also a lot of strife and killings between the tribes in the mine kampongs. Don&rsquo;t blame &#8220;apartheid&#8221; for your miserable ignorance, you pathetic morons.<br>
&#8220;There is nothing more frightening than active ignorance&#8221;  - Goethe</p>

		<p>South Africa has seen its gold production plummet over the last 15 years. In 2008, it was overtaken by China as the largest gold producer. Part of this has to do with the inconsistency of electricity to enable the mines to run at full capacity and the exhuasting of known gold deposits.<br>
To fix this problem, SA needs to get its power plants&rsquo; coverage and reliability up and also actively search for new gold deposits.</p>

		<p>re sbuffalonative:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid a lot of whites are just a superstitious about the magical efficacy of degrees, diplomas, privileges, licenses, etc.</p>
<p>they actually believe that &#8220;eliminating the hurdles of discrimination&#8221; will turn blacks with IQs in the 70s or 80s into civil engineers and research scientists.</p>
<p>confronted with a white person having an IQ of 70 or 80, they will say:<br>
&#8220;what a hopeless moron, I wouldn&rsquo;t invest a cent to educate him&#8221;.</p>
<p>confronted with a black having an IQ of 70 or 80, they marvel over his intellectual potential.</p>
<p>according to this logic, giraffes and zebras could be scientists and mathematicians if only they have the right educational background&hellip;.</p>

For many, mining still epitomizes the apartheid equation of white power and black poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p>How is one &#8216;torn&rsquo; from their family by voluntarily migrating for a job?  Either find a job closer to home or bring your family with you, or start your own business.  Ah, but it is so much eaiser to blame the big, bad white man.</p>
<p>What about black people who are &#8216;torn&rsquo; away from their families to go to work for a black owned business?</p>
<p>This is the same boo hoo stuff that is being shoveled on us in the States.  &#8220;Oh, the poor latino immigrant, oppressed and sad because he was FORCED to leave his home village and come to America to work&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Oh yeah.  Putting Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s relatives in charge will SURELY fix the problem.<br>
That&rsquo;s like putting Imelda Marcos in charge of a shoe conglomerate.  &#8220;all for me, none for you.&#8221;  Just because you like gold teeth and nose piercings doesn&rsquo;t mean you know how to run a gold mine or a corporation mining gold.  What they DO know is how to rip off all industry, run it into the ground, and then flee the country resting on the millions and millions they&rsquo;ve stolen out of the country&rsquo;s assets.  The Mandelas will be good at THAT.</p>

		<p>#5 Eduard is more correct, the issue is a bit more complicated. </p>
<p>These issues have made headlines in our press:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/35csnqz</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/3a2jtos</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/37bsaf9</p>
<p>There are two parties involved - mining groups which just close down unprofitable mines without any rehabilitation (too expensive) and then the government who does not enforce existing rehabilitation legislation.</p>
<p>Superficially it sounds like the mines, with foreign shareholders, have made their bucks, push off grasshopper like and leave us with the mess. </p>
<p>Certainly this happened and does still happen. There are some environmentalist programs on our TV that follow such cases where valuable irreplaceable wetlands with scarce plant and animal life - some unique only to this country - are being destroyed,  Environmental Impact Studies (EIS) as prescribed by law not properly done and government officials bribed. </p>
<p>The accusation has been made that unprofitable mines are sold at black partners in the light of the BEE drive, and the unsophisticated new black owners suddenly discover they have been sold a dud.</p>
<p>An inkling of the complications:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2vp8dqa</p>
<p>Then there is a much bigger picture, but a much more complicated picture, and that is who really is in control of South Africa Inc.? The blacks and the ANC/SACP/Cosatu alliance, or the international conspirators who brought white South Africa to fall and replaced it with a weak water head baby government.</p>
<p>It is incredible complex distinguishing fact from fiction not being an insider oneself.</p>
