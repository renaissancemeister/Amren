<h1><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2010/11/08/ri_voters_reject_bid_to_amend_states_official_name/">The Name&rsquo;s the Same in R.I.</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By a ratio of nearly 4 to 1, voters opted last week to retain the name enshrined in the colony&rsquo;s Royal Charter, despite opponents who argued that the centuries-old wording conjures memories of Rhode Island&rsquo;s major role in the American slave trade.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was political correctness taken to the nth extreme,&#8221; said Jeff Britt, 42, of Warwick, who voted not to amend the state constitution to call Rhode Island simply that. &#8220;It was inane on its face.&#8221;</p>
<p>But to supporters, a vote to lop off &#8220;Providence Plantations&#8221; would have helped erase a connotation of slavery and a reminder to minority residents that Rhode Island&rsquo;s early wealth was rooted in trans-Atlantic trafficking of human beings.</p>

		<p>Interesting how blacks were whining that Rhode Island was hurting their feeling by constantly reminding them of slavery.</p>
<p>Of course the NAACP, Sharpton, Farrakhan, Jesse Jerkson and the Reparations Shakedown movement would never dream of reminding blacks of that era. </p>

<p>If only George Orwell were alive today to see just how prophetic his distopian novels, and 1984 in particular, have become.  I suppose I could understand removing the &#8220;Providence Plantations&#8221; for length reasons (although even that I would not condone), but for political correctness?  What kind of idiot gets sensitive because his state&rsquo;s name has the word &#8220;Plantations&#8221; in it?  Like I always say, If you don&rsquo;t like it, you can get out.  The fact that Rhode island has to try and please minorities, of which there were once very few in that state, shows the sad condition that modern-day America is in.  I only hope that political correctness falls out of fashion very soon.</p>

		<p>&#8220;plan·ta·tion  –noun <br>
3. History/Historical . <br>
a. a colony or new settlement. <br>
b. the establishment of a colony or new settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The term in the 1600&rsquo;s had a connotation different from what it later meant. NOT necessarily a large farm tract growing a cash crop and worked by slaves!</p>

		<p>They still haven&rsquo;t had it explaned to them that the word &#8220;plantation&#8221; simply means &#8220;settlement.&#8221;  It was used for example in Northern Lreland, when The Crown sought to relocate some problematic border Scots and others, calling it &#8220;The Ulster Plantation.&#8221;  When the landlords raised the rents, many moved on to America and settled in open land in the Appalachans.  Many whites in America are descended from these, some of the earliest settlers who faced the harshest conditions, but were the majority of soldiery during the Revolutionary War.  Throughout history, they are probably truly the most oppressed of all peoples in the Americas, including Indians and blacks.  In the era of PC, they still get called &#8220;white trash,&#8221; even by ignorant whites.  I have posted this before, but I think that it is important.  How can Americans know so little about relevant history?</p>
<p>Plantation is not a system of slavery, but a settlement that was established by Royal decree.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a post. <br>
To the minority residents, GET OVER IT and stop your constant whining and demands. We White people who are here today ( much to your displeasure) had no part in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade nor do we accept any guilt that you choose to pile on us while at the same time living off our labors. Your ancestors&rsquo; labors as slaves didn&rsquo;t support the entire White population of even of the Antebellum South whereas we support at least 75% of your numbers.</p>
<p>I repeat- GET OVER IT! Just as we have to &#8220;get over&#8221; the countless assaults, rapes and murders that you perpetrate on us every day in just about every geographic location in the country.<br>
If you&rsquo;re that upset about the never used name of a state then consider repatriating yourselves to the Motherland where you can exist in constant state of starvation, have your limbs hacked off and your infant girls raped and suffer early death from a number of diseases that you&rsquo;re spared here due to the research of evil racist American and European White scientists. <br>
You should thank whatever God you recognize that your ancestors made the crossing. </p>

<p>Probably because you can&rsquo;t have a dependent class who will do your bidding unless you maintain a certain level of ignorance in them. It&rsquo;s especially easy when that class has a possible genetic deficit from the get go.<br>

		<p>As Jedermann and Whiteplight have explained, the word  <i>&#8220;plantation&#8221; </i>referred in those times to  <b>a colony or settlement that had been PLANTED  </b>in a new place.  In the same way, the Puritan settlement in Massachusetts was a plantation. (There was the  &#8220;Plymouth Plantation&#8221;.)</p>
<p>That sort of &#8220;plantation&#8221;  (a plantation of people)  had nothing to do with the later Southern estate growing cotton and tobacco,  nor with slavery in any way. This petty stuff is as silly as complaining about a black hole in space.  It reveals their ignorance and their egocentricity.  The problem is that blacks, like children, see everything as being all about them. This had NOTHING to do with them!</p>
<p>In other circumstances, I would have voted for shortening the name,  just for convenience sake and because it has become archaic.  But not for political correctness. Let it stand!</p>

		<p>As a Southerner, I&rsquo;m offended that Rhode Island uses the word &#8220;Plantation&#8221; in their title.  That word belongs to us, for that&rsquo;s where we made our money and kept our blacks under control.  We can&rsquo;t use the word plantation any longer, nor can we keep our blacks under control.  </p>
<p>If Rhode Island can get away with using the word, then can&rsquo;t they please take the blacks off our hands?  We have a very dangerous oversupply&hellip;</p>

		<p>Apparently real democracy can be a great threat to liberalism. Suppose that the people could vote on whether they wanted forced bussing, affirmative action, massive legal immigration, section 8 housing, unprotected borders, and other liberal schemes. America would be a nasty place for the liberals to live.</p>
