<h1>Some South African Smokers Taking Concoction of AIDS Drug and Marijuana</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ketan Mukherjee, Top News (New Zealand), November 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As per the officials and the health experts, some people in South Africa are taking marijuana along with the AIDS drugs and there have been stealing incidences, where AIDS drugs have been taken away from patients there to mix them with marijuana, so as to puff the mixture.</p>
<p>The blend of both the things is known as &#8216;whoonga&rsquo; and its incidences have been found in eastern KwaZulu-Natal, where AIDS is quite prevalent. But, there have been concerns that the addiction could spread to other parts of the country as well.</p>
<p>No evidences has been found about how the concoction is more effective in making a person high than the pot alone. It could just be the notion of smokers that mixing AIDS drugs with marijuana make them high.</p>
<p>There has also been skepticism that some of the drug dealers are selling whoonga mixture with soap powder and even with rat poison, just to propel more profits.</p>
<p>Such a conduct of drug dealers is an abuse to those suffering with HIV who are taking treatment for the same, as expressed by Lihle Dlamini of the Treatment Action Campaign.</p>
<p>Whoonga is marketed openly in eastern KwaZulu-Natal and is sold as the cream-colored powder at 20 rand (about $3) a smoke.<br>

		<p>First thing this reminds me of is telling the younger set at Applebee`s how my generation had it made. &#8221; It was after birth control and before AIDS.&#8221; <br>
  The second thing it made me think of was how in the 70`s before Nancy Reagan, guys would wear marijuana leaf concert tees to class and throw Frisbees at lunch with joints clipped to them. This was &#8220;High&#8221; School folks!! <br>
 The last thing it reminded me of was how time passed us by. I remember in my mid 20`s about all the chatter about this new thing called Ecstasy&hellip;<br>
 I remember how a buddy of mine told me, &#8220;I`m thinking of trying X&hellip;&#8221;  and I asked him, &#8220;Y!?!?&#8221; <br>
Whoonga&hellip; I guess its the Grandchild of Whizbang!!&hellip;</p>

Years ago, Germany offered to GIVE South Africa AIDS drugs but Mbeki didn&rsquo;t want them because he believed AIDS was a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t give them drugs, you&rsquo;re a racist. Give them drugs and they misuse them.</p>
<p>I say flood the country with any drug they demand. In the end, it won&rsquo;t matter.<br>

<p>The whole article reads like the Onion.  It&rsquo;s sad, infuriating, &amp; hilarious all at the same time.  What delightful creatures black folks are.  What would we do for amusement without them&hellip;?</p>

		<p>according to this article aids drugs cost 263 to 2315 dollars a month.  And they are just burning it up.<br>

		<p> What the article doesn&rsquo;t tell you is that the African AIDS sufferers receive long lectures on why they HAVE to take the Anti-retrovirals regularly.<br>
 Missing just ONE dose raises your chance of catching full-blown Aids to 50%. Missing two raises it to 90%.<br>
 The Africans ignore everything they&rsquo;re told, take a single Dose, consider themselves &#8216;cured&rsquo; then smoke/sell the rest.</p>
<p> Our Freely-provided Aids drugs are creating an AIDS Holocaust, all thanks to ignorant low-IQ natives combined with Western generosity and stupidity.<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that there are all these White researchers spending countless dollars and hours trying to cure the various forms of death that we have in this world, when we ourselves are demographically declining.</p>
<p>eg. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/22u2v9n" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/22u2v9n</a></p>
<p>Especially when the result of all of this toil, only ends up in a crack pipe.</p>
<p>Why bother saving someone who can not even save themselves?<br>
(I suppose you could rhetorically ask that, of both the blacks and Whites in the above equation).</p>

		<p>there is something called being responsible for yourself.  When I was a poor kid myself, we collected change for the poor children in Africa. That was fifty some years ago. I have tried, I have done my share. I don&rsquo;t care if they call it Whoonga or whatever, let them smoke it or drink it, I have to deal with the consequences of my actions, let them deal with theirs.  </p>

		<p>I seem to recall reading in the not so distant past about TB patients in NYC. Seems the third world patients don&rsquo;t take their drugs as prescribed, many just disappear and don&rsquo;t come back for follow-up. And we wonder why we now have drug-resistant TB?  </p>

		<p>Is anyone surprised? Those are the same people who ferment and sniff human feces to get a buzz. </p>
<p>First jenkem, then those cool flip-flops made out of two-liter soda bottles, now whoonga. Brinkster (of Black Invention Myths fame) needs to quit saying that sub-Saharan Blacks never invented anything.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m constantly amazed and pleasantly surprised when news items like this confirm the creativity and keen intellectual curiosity of the black element when it creates some new and exciting concoction like this.  With the dumbing-down (thanks in large part to our wonderful public education system) of the American populace, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until said concoction is discovered and embraced by the stupid segment of the white community. Ain&rsquo;t diversity wonderful?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m amazed by coincidentally seeing something similar last week on the tube  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s just as bizarre, but closer to home  &mdash;  </p>
<p>I was watching the cable reality crime show &#8220;First 48&#8221;, a series where a camera crew follows real detectives on real homicide cases in US cities, especially interrogations at the station house. The suspects, witnesses and perps all tend to, uh,  reinforce stereotypes, and I mean vigorously.</p>
<p>One of these characters was confronted about suspicions of drug use, and admitted to doing something I&rsquo;d never heard of, called &#8220;wet&#8221;  &mdash;  apparently it&rsquo;s the new cool thing to do in some circles.</p>
<p>According to the narrator  &mdash;  you may want to sit down  &mdash;  &#8220;wet&#8221; is a marijuana joint soaked in <i>embalming fluid</i>.</p>
<p>Wow. I guess it could explain some odd behavior&hellip;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know which is more annoying: Africans wasting our generous healthcare donations to them by misusing the medicine to get stoned; or having to hear the babytalk words (&#8220;Whoonga&#8221;) they make up to describe their latest intoxicant. </p>
<p>Just ONCE I&rsquo;d like to hear a word or a concept come out of the Dark Continent that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a white preschooler. </p>

		<p>I remember Bush 2 and John Kerry in an altruistic bidding war over who would give more to fight African aids. Bush said &#8220;I&rsquo;m giving 10 billion dollars for aids in Africa&#8221;; and kerry responded &#8220;I&rsquo;m giving 20 billion&#8221;. Money we don&rsquo;t have down the sewer.</p>

		<p>Jenkem isn&rsquo;t real. I know the whole idea of Africans sniffing poop is hilarious but it&rsquo;s just not true. The whole thing was a hoax from totse back in the &#8216;90&rsquo;s and got resurrected by various *chan boards. So please, knock it off with the jenkem stuff already.</p>
<p>As far as &#8216;embalming fluid&rsquo; goes it&rsquo;s generally slang for PCP but some idiots have soaked joints in actual embalming fluid. Think of it as evolution in action.</p>
