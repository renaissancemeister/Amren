			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry Olsen, Bloomberg, November 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The party didn&rsquo;t win this election because of any enthusiasm gap between their backers and Democratic supporters, as had been long predicted. {snip}</p>
<p>The election results were instead due to a massive swing among independents, particularly those in rural and exurban counties. Exit polls showed that independents favored Republicans by 16 points, a turnabout from 2008 when they favored Democrats by about the same margin.</p>
<p>Exit polls identified the primary source of the landslide: white working-class voters. This group, defined as whites who aren&rsquo;t college graduates, has voted Republican in presidential contests but often split tickets to elect Democratic congressmen. This time they supported Republicans for Congress by a record 29 points, more than for any of the party&rsquo;s recent presidential nominees.</p>
<p>Ousting Incumbents</p>
<p>This working-class anger drew in even those who normally vote Democratic, as we can see by looking at the specific districts Republicans won.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This crop of new Republican backers presents the party with unique challenges, if it wants to hold on to them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama Versus Nixon</p>
<p>Republicans need to take this challenge seriously. Working-class whites voted Republican primarily because they intensely dislike President Obama. Polls of the white working class electorate this year put Obama&rsquo;s approval rating at close to 30 percent, or just a few points higher than President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s in the days before his resignation.</p>
<p>Republicans will need every one of those votes because other, worrisome trends in the electorate continued this year. Polls showed that, even with the depth of the recession, Republicans captured only about 10 percent of blacks&rsquo; support and a third of Hispanics&rsquo;, no better than in other years.</p>
<p>The Latino share of the electorate reached 8 percent, a record high for a mid-term election, while black turnout dropped from its high of 13 percent in 2008 to its historic 10 percent level this year. If Latinos continue to grow as a group, and blacks turn out in droves again to re-elect Obama, the Republican nominee in 2012 will be hard-pressed to win without retaining the record share of white working-class voters the party garnered this week.</p>
<p>Educated Voters</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The combination of these trends explains the two big Republican disappointments on election night: the failure of Sharron Angle and Ken Buck to win Senate seats in Nevada and Colorado. The conservative Tea Party favorites swept the rural and exurban parts of their states, but lost big in the Las Vegas and Denver areas, where highly educated whites and most Latinos live.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Less-Educated Voters</p>
<p>West Virginia is the capital of the white working class. Fifty-eight percent of the state&rsquo;s voters were whites without a college degree, 19 points higher than the national average. Ninety-five percent are white and 69 percent say they disapprove of Obama&rsquo;s job performance.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Democratic governor, Joe Manchin, swept to an easy 10-point victory over Republican John Raese, a wealthy businessman who owns mansions in Florida and expressed doubts about the minimum wage.</p>

		<p>Nobody in the White resistance could&rsquo;ve ever predicted that the Republicans would &#8216;go white&rsquo; and this is why its important to keep the Tea Party as close as possible to the GOP and rural America while avoiding overt mention of race and religion altogether. Looks like the WASP hasn&rsquo;t lost its sting. </p>

		<p>Not only is it possible for Republicans to retain their landslide margins among whites, it is also possible to expand them, Mr. Wise.</p>
<p>One word:</p>
<p>Mississippi.</p>
<p>There are such things in MS as &#8220;elections.&#8221;  Call them that if you wish, but I prefer the more accurate term &#8220;racial headcount.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just what do - &#8220;highly educated whites and most Latinos&#8221; - have in common?  Perhaps someone like our Mr. Scott could explain this mystery to us non-Coloradans.  I don&rsquo;t get it.  </p>

<p>But Comrade Olsen, what will happen if in 2012, the Republicans get 65% to 68% of the white vote?</p>
<p>It is erroneous and foolish to expect that the white shift has even hit a threshold, let alone an &ldquo;upper limit.&rdquo; You must remember, that two very solidly &ldquo;blue&rdquo; states (Pennsylvania  and Illinois) just went &ldquo;red.&rdquo; With the new US Senator from the &ldquo;Land of Lincoln,&rdquo; obtaining &ldquo;our savior&rsquo;s&rdquo; seat. How is this explained away, particularly during hard economic times and a likely progressed erosion of the white majorities in each of these states by nonwhites since 2008?</p>
<p>Think about West Virginia in those terms and you might feel a reason to shudder and not gloat about 2012, Comrade Olsen!</p>

		<p>Dear GOP:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not taking a risk by openly pandering to whites.  Most of us WANT you to do that.  We want you to stop pandering to blacks and illegals.  We want you to discredit MLK and the whole Civil Rights movement.  You can pander to the white vote and represent us, since we are the bread and butter of this country.  You have two choices:</p>
<p>1. Openly be pro-white and advance our interests.  get good, strong, conservative whites (especially white men) in positions of political power.  </p>
<p>  &mdash;  OR  &mdash;  </p>
<p>2.  You can continue to pander to non-whites, most of whom hate whites, hate America, and would rather be victims to make money than work hard and honestly like the white conservatives who vote for you.  </p>
<p>Make a decision, GOP.  </p>

		<p>Despite a decrease in overall numbers whites and race realists have the benefit of discipline when it comes to voting. Thank goodness everyone is not forced to vote. </p>
<p>It is imperative that we maintain the absolute highest turnout possible in all future elections to erase the numerical disadvantage. Blacks tend not to vote unless given freebies or a black is running for major office and even then they are unreliable in making it to the polls. However, they vote without any clue as to what they are doing and will vote for democrats or a black over 90 percent of the time.</p>
<p>Hispanics have less of a herd mentality and may surprise whites with nods to Republican or even Tea Party candidates. Even a small shift can be of major importance.<br>

Republicans could hold their numbers (and expand them) by doing one simple thing: honor their own campaign rhetoric.</p>
<p>People vote Republican because those running promise three things: lower taxes and smaller government. The third issue is doing something about illegal aliens.</p>
<p>What happens when Republicans get into office is they don&rsquo;t lower taxes, don&rsquo;t shrink government, and increasingly, don&rsquo;t do anything to stop illegal immigration.</p>
<p>When those who voted for Republics see they broke their problems, they either don&rsquo;t vote or vote for another candidate.</p>
<p>Ted Kennedy stayed in office his whole life because he delivered on his promises or at least he fought for them even if he didn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>If the Republicans do what they promised in this election to win, they&rsquo;ll win again in two years. If they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;ll be voted out or ignored out of office.</p>

<p>What? Of course the Dems can count on the nonwhite vote. And yes, the Dems DO deliver what the nonwhites expect!</p>
<p> Seems like you are saying that maybe if the Repubs &#8220;deliver substance&#8221; to these nonwhites then they will vote Republican?  Heaven help the Republican Party if they ever give an inch to these nonwhites, (which they already do by pandering). If they do start giving nonwhites what they want, then they will evolve into one big party with the Dems. Then we can forget about the two-party system. </p>

<p>That is the real danger.  If the GOP refuses to &#8220;pander&#8221; to the Whites who just voted for them, only the emergence of a viable pro-White party will prevent the White masses from either jumping back to the Socialist side or refraining from voting altogether.</p>

		<p>I think that half of this nation&rsquo;s sellout (industry, office/IT and now University/R&D;) of itself has been a preconceived process of disempowering white Americans as productive society members who have a &#8216;right&rsquo; to declare and support themselves as such, through the voting in of self-protectionist government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just The Big Three that another poster mentioned (lower taxes, smaller government, immigration halts and border security).  It&rsquo;s the sum total of stripping this nation from it&rsquo;s principle control agencies (those with the wealth to buy into multiculty as _multinational business_) and returning it to it&rsquo;s white base.  Who only need this land for ourselves, not for the betterment of the entire planet&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>These humble souls are the ones who are watching their livelihoods move overseas and the motley mob of the overseas come here to begin a process of squabbling over the dung-scraper jobs of a &#8216;service economy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In this, the least of us are the most, as you would expect from any Bell Curve population.  And they will not breed to land dominant nor participate in a government of self rule if themselves continually given environment stresses that reduce their confidence in themselves and their continuity.</p>
<p>We have a HUGE ways to go to return U.S. to Us.  Pandering to the &#8216;And Then?&rsquo; handouters is not a part of that.</p>
<p>Secession to protect those &#8216;Us&rsquo; with whom we have an innate affinity based identity may be the only way forward for a _nation_ (from Nascere, to be born, a people) which must fear the top 10% of it&rsquo;s own race selling them out.  Not for idealistic reasons, but because we are not part of their bigger and better plan$.</p>

<p>And blow it they will.</p>
<p>Obama is likely dead in the water - a one term President.  All Democrats need do to recapture power is run a white male or female candidate with a populist program.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all Republicans need do to blow it is to bail out California, ensure that any modest economic recovery is limited to speculators, and fiddle-fart around with genuine immigration reform.</p>

		<p>The Republicans won because of working class whites.  Now, will the Republicans please do something <i>for</i> the people who got them elected?  Will they stop worrying so much about tax cuts for people making over $250,000 a year and instead stop illegal immigrants from taking their jobs, and end the wars that are causing so many of their sons to come home in caskets?</p>

		<p>AmRen readers need to start working the phones, and call their GOP Governors, Congressmen, and Senators that benefited from our support. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to hold their feet to the fire, and make them earn the support they received, because now we want some things in return.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with our wide open borders, and Illegal Aliens bankrupting our Hospitals, who are uninsured, or with their free Medicaid, as well as Food Stamps, and Section 8 Housing. Section 8 Housing which allows them to also attend our Publiclly funded Schools. Is it ay wonder why Class sizes are so large?</p>
<p>With all the past talk about a National I.D. card, which is an outrage, we White Americans need to prove who we are, with a National I.D., but Juan Valdez gets a Matricular card from the Mexican Embassay, and he&rsquo;s good to go and get a State Driver&rsquo;s license, which will, I am sure, have a false address on it, as well as open a Bank account at many willing Banks, such as Bank of America. </p>
<p>These leeches pay no State or Federal Income Taxes, yet they drain our finacial resouces, and they take our jobs, lower our pay, and send money back to Mexico, and other points south of the border. This needs to end, yesterday.</p>
<p>Another point of contention, is something many posters here have brought up. It is the 1965 Immigration Reform Act. Yes, we want that, along with BarryCare, to be repealed.</p>
<p>Let us remember that since Congress has the Power of the Purse, it is imperative that the Republicans stop funding such bloated and Unconstitutional Federal Agencies such as the Department of Education, Dept. of Health, the Dept. of Energy, as we can all see just how well this Agency has done for us, still using Arab oil, and fighting never ending wars, while losing our sons and daughters in the madness of it all. </p>
<p>Yes, the GOP owes us, big time, and it&rsquo;s our turn to call in the markers. <br>
