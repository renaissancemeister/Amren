<h3>Latino share of electorate continues to increase</h3>
<p>Washington, DC  &mdash;  Latino voters proved pivotal in several hotly contested midterm elections, including in Nevada, Colorado, and California, and likely helped Democrats retain their majority in the United States Senate. According to exit polls, Latino voters contributed significantly to the margin of victory in the Senate and gubernatorial contests in California and Colorado, as well as, most notably, the Senate race in Nevada between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Assemblywoman Sharron Angle. In addition, initial exit poll reports suggest that Latinos, motivated by the widespread anti-immigrant tone of many campaigns, increased their share of the electorate in several states. These results confirm an earlier report on Latino voters by NCLR (National Council of La Raza), the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States, which projected that an additional 700,000 Latino voters could participate in this election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Latino voters sent a loud and clear message this election: We reject the politics of fear and demonization. Where candidates engaged in the shameful scapegoating of immigrants and tactics that transparently disrespected Hispanics, such as in Nevada and Colorado, the response from Hispanic voters was overwhelming,&#8221; said Janet Murguía, President and CEO of NCLR. &#8220;Latinos in 2010 reaffirmed their influential role in American politics, both as voters and as candidates, which will only increase in future elections. Political leaders and parties that demonize or take Latino voters for granted are taking a great risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This was also an historic election for Latinos with the win of Susana Martinez in New Mexico, the first Latina ever to be elected as governor. And with the elections of Brian Sandoval as governor in Nevada and Marco Rubio as senator in Florida, it is clear that Latinos are forces to be reckoned with in both parties,&#8221; noted Murguía. On the voting front, Latino voters in these and other states affirmed that candidates and positions matter in their voting choices.</p>
<p>With an unemployment rate higher than the national average, Latinos placed jobs at the top of their priorities, with immigration acting as an energizing force. In fact, immigration was cited as the top issue in several polls  &mdash;  an historic first, but unsurprising given the extensive use of anti-immigrant tactics during this campaign season. Additional information on Latino voter concerns and motivations is available in an election-eve poll of likely Latino voters conducted by Latino Decisions and sponsored by NCLR in collaboration with the Service Employees International Union and America&rsquo;s Voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we look to a new Congress, Latinos are demanding real solutions from political leaders on the economy, jobs, and immigration, and we want their commitment to stop demonizing immigrants and Hispanics for political gain. Both parties now share the responsibility of leading and producing results. It&rsquo;s time to govern,&#8221; concluded Murguía.<br/>

		<p>There is supposed to be no dual citizenship if you are a U.S. citizen.  This is hardly ever enforced, and I have known a number of people with dual citizenships.  It gives them advantages those of us who are merely U.S. citizens lack, especially in international commerce.  If a new Federal law was passed denied dual citizens the vote, this Hispanic/La Raza problem would be greatly impacted.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ll get nothing from this congress or this president. Hispanics can boast about how important they are but the democrats will always take their votes for granted. Just like they do black votes.<br/>
And now since New Mexico has a &#8220;latina&#8221; governor we can expect to see rapid improvements for the &#8220;latino&#8221; community.<br/>
Ain&rsquo;t diversity wonderful?</p>

		<p>Geee&hellip;.how surprising.  La Raza lying about the amount they influenced the election.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the truth of the matter that has these people wringing their hands in desperation right now.  Soon, they will be wringing their hands on the other side of the border, I think.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s evidence that irregularities exist in Harry Reid&rsquo;s slim victory.  Harry Reid was considered unbeatable and a &#8220;shoo-in&#8221; so the fact that Sharon Angle ran on a staunch anti-immigrant campaign and nearly pulled off the defeat shows that that strategy is a clear winner with white voters and possibly even with some minorities.  </p>
<p>The press release also informs us that Hispanics who are legal residents have clearly taken the side of their illegal brethren in this raging debate and put the racial interests of Hispanics above other, more pressing national interests.          </p>

Nevada has the highest unemployment, the most foreclosures, in the 11th hour, Reid went on Hispanic television to announce he&rsquo;d push the Dream Act to aid illegal aliens and he still won.</p>

		<p>#1 above is incorrect about dual citizenship.  It is legal according to the supreme court.  All of us should be looking into the advangages of dual citizenship for possible future use when the powder keg explodes here.</p>

		<p>According to anchor baby logic, a child born of illegal Mexicans is a dual citizens at birth.  The Mexican Const bestows its citizenship on the kid no matter where it is born.  And the sucker US likewise.  Dual at birth.</p>
<p>Disgusting.</p>

		<p>Three things:</p>
<p>1. A silver lining to Reid&rsquo;s survival: he is awful on illegal aliens, but he is far more benign on certain other issues (gun rights, most notably) than his likely replacement Chuckie Schumer would have been.</p>
<p>2. Joe Manchin in WV showed that the Blue Dog brand is alive and kicking. If the Dem party is pulled to the right after the GOP, that can only help our cause.</p>
<p>3. The reason the GOP didn&rsquo;t take over the Senate was because the one-third of seats up for re-election were already heavily GOP ones from 2004, before the Dems started making advances.</p>

		<p>This brouhaha about losing Hispanic votes for criticizing illegal imminvasion is cow manure.</p>
<p>Gov. Jan Brewer won on a landslide, while before signing the AZ SB 1070 her approval rating was in mid-20%s.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to then Gov. Pete Wilson who won on a landslide his re-election after championing prop 187.</p>
<p>The fact is that if the white conservative base go to polls in droves, Hispanic vote is a drop in a bucked that hardly ever makes any difference.</p>
<p>And vice versa, when white conservatives, discouraged by candidate&rsquo;s weak or cowardly stance on immigration, stay at home, the voters&rsquo; turnout is low and small groups, like Hispanics, can make the difference.</p>
<p>Meg Whitman lost for that very reason: only some 40% white conservatives did cast votes. Should the number be 60%, she would have won, comfortably.<br/>
