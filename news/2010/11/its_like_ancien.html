			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A sophisticated cross-border tunnel  &mdash;  equipped with a rail system, ventilation and fluorescent lighting  &mdash;  has been shut down by U.S. and Mexican officials.</p>
<p>It is the second such tunnel discovered in San Diego this month, authorities said today.</p>
<p>The tunnel is 2,200 feet long and runs from the kitchen of a home in Tijuana, Mexico, to two warehouses in San Diego&rsquo;s Otay Mesa industrial district.</p>
<p>Mike Unzueta, head of investigations at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego, said the cinderblock-lined entry to the tunnel dropped 80 to 90 feet to a wood-lined floor.</p>
<p>From the U.S. side, there was a stairway leading to a room about 50 feet underground that was full of marijuana.</p>
<p>Mr Unzueta said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s a lot like how the ancient Egyptians buried the kings and queens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Authorities seized more than 20 tons of marijuana, and Mr Unzueta said the tunnel  &mdash;  and another found in early November  &mdash;  are the work of Mexico&rsquo;s Sinaloa cartel, headed by the country&rsquo;s most-wanted drug lord, Joaquin &#8216;El Chapo&rsquo; Guzman.</p>
<p>Mr Unzueta said: &#8216;We think ultimately they are controlled by the same overall cartel but that the tunnels were being managed and run independently by different cells operating within the same organisation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The newly discovered passage is one of the most advanced to date, with sophisticated construction and a rail system for drugs to be carried on a small cart.</p>
<p>Three men were arrested in the United States, and the Mexican military raided a ranch in Mexico and made five arrests in connection with the tunnel, authorities said.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities have discovered more than 125 clandestine tunnels along the Mexican border since the early 1990s, though many were crude and incomplete.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities do not know how long the latest tunnel was operating. Mr Unzueta said investigators began to look into several warehouses in June on a tip that emerged from a large bust of marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine by the San Bernardino County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities followed a trailer from one of the warehouses to a Border Patrol checkpoint in Temecula, where they seized 27,600 pounds of marijuana.</p>
<p>The driver, whose name was not released, was arrested, along with two others who went to a residence in suburban El Cajon that had $13,500 cash inside.</p>
<p>Mr Unzueta said: &#8216;That [trailer] was literally filled top to bottom, front to back. There wasn&rsquo;t any room for anything else in that tractor-trailer but air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Three tons of marijuana were found in a &#8216;subterranean room&rsquo; and elsewhere in the tunnel on the U.S. side, authorities said.</p>
<p>Mexican officials seized four tons of pot at a ranch in northern Mexico, bringing the total haul to more than 20 tons.</p>
<p>The discovery of the cross-border tunnel earlier this month marked one of the largest marijuana seizures in the United States, with agents confiscating 20 tons of marijuana they said was smuggled through the underground passage.</p>
<p>One of the warehouses involved in the tunnel discovered this week is only a half-block away. Several sophisticated tunnels have ended in San Diego warehouses.<br>

Otherwise we are going to have to drive 2 or 3 inch hardened steel rods with ductile layered sleeves into the ground 50 feet deep with another 30 above grade and spaced 10 inches apart, for the entire length of the US/Mexico border.  <br>

		<p>Just doing the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do, I guess. Of course, it&rsquo;s driven by demand; somebody out there is smoking and snorting all that stuff. The sheer volume of the drug trade is hard to comprehend. Face it, a huge number of Americans have an insatiable thirst for mind altering substances to go along with their booze.</p>

<p>BTW, I&rsquo;d bet a not insignificant percentage of white liberals indifferent to massive third-world immigration are potheads.<br>

		<p>My understanding is that these tunnels are dug by professional miners who are then EXECUTED WHEN THE WORK IS COMPLETE! Maybe some DEA type reading this can illuminate us further?</p>
<p>When entering, from the American end, I would be very wary of booby traps and such designed to kill or maim intruders or even collapse the tunnels to unwanted guests.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Face it, a huge number of Americans have an insatiable thirst for mind altering substances to go along with their booze.&#8221; says poster #2.</p>
<p>I tire of this argument all the time. When you say &#8220;Americans&#8221; 99% of dummies in this country say it to mean Whites only. From now on, why don&rsquo;t people tell the truths? Many of these &#8220;Americans&#8221; are illegals themselves, not to mention, blacks, browns and yellows in this country.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t anyone know about all those Mexicans in Mexico, those in Guatemala etc., and those in 3rd world countries, including Africa and the Middle East, Afghanistan, Indonesia, etc. have their forms of getting high off some kind of weird drug?</p>
<p>I can remember when this country was 95% White and for the most part, drug free. The &#8220;commies&#8221; from within, starting in the 60&rsquo;s, with all their anti-White movements, (immigration, desegregation, women&rsquo;s rights, birth control, etc.) is the reason we are sinking into the abyss.  </p>

<p>Here! Here!  Yes, that&rsquo;s a very interesting point.  It makes me wonder if there are US Officials on the cartel payroll that might work for the DEA or DHS or both.</p>
<p>I still say legalization is the ONLY WAY to reduce drug trafficking to insignificant levels.  Take the profit out of drugs and the cartels will dry up eventually.</p>
<p>At least the authorities should start with the legalization of pot.  Marijuana is reportedly the bread and butter of the cartels, with the harder drugs being the dessert.</p>
<p>But can legalization come about IF there are US authorities on cartel payrolls?  Certainly the drug gangs don&rsquo;t want to see their product legalized.  I&rsquo;d venture to say they spend millions of dollars per year lobbying against legalization from the shadows, using front groups.</p>
<p>And to all you naysayers out there who are against legalization &#8220;because it will increase teen use,&#8221; let me point out they can get all they want right now, and many of them smoke it simply because it is illegal. </p>
<p>Personally, I hate to see these criminals get filthy rich and obtain such great power.<br>
  <br>
And, no, I DON&rsquo;T want legalization, because I use the screwy  stuff.  </p>

		<p>To poster # 10 :</p>
<p>Yes many of the drug users maybe be black, brown or even yellow. But its a fact that most of the drug users in the United States population wise are white Americans. Especially amongst the new generation whites and blacks narcotic substance abuse seems to be a rage. As a Physician, I can attest to the fact that the drug war can be won if only most or atleast a good portion of white &amp; black Americans say NO to drugs. How many times do you see a Jewish, Indian or Japanese American with the drug problem that afflicts so many whites, blacks and even illegal criminals ? Supply and demand go hand in hand. In many ways my blood boils when I see today&rsquo;s callous American youth ( Yes, that means mainstream youth) who have glorified hip hop, liberal lazy ethnics and overglorified mind numbing digital entertainment over more intellectual activities and studies. The Asiatics ( Chinese, Indians) and Jewish still seem to have their head on their shoulders. We are partly to blame.</p>
