<h1><a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/prwebGatewayBlack/SearchEngine/prweb4710774.htm">Global Black Search Engine Launches</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, PRWeb, October 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tired of struggling to find unique African, African American, Afro European and Caribbean blogs and websites online, Obi Linton, founder of the Annual Black Web Awards developed GatewayBlack.com, the global Black search engine. After viewing several lists of top 1,000 websites and not seeing any sites with Black content, Linton suspected that others worldwide also had similar challenges. He knew he was on to something after reviewing the daily results in his new engine&rsquo;s crawlers, which turned up thousands of Black sites worldwide that he would never have found through a search in a major search engine.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are only so many spaces on the first and second pages of search results of a major search engine. In those critical spaces, Black blogs and websites rarely show, especially when the searched terms are not directly seeking Black content,&#8221; Linton explained. Black websites lose out on those casual searches, where the user is seeking products, services or current events news, but isn&rsquo;t offered the opportunity to find it through websites with Black content. &#8220;One need only review any list of the top 1,000 websites online,&#8221; said Linton. &#8220;While many international websites tend to be listed, there&rsquo;s a clear lack of websites with Black news, content, products or services.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years, hundreds of ethnic and culture based search engines worldwide have helped website users find unique content. When building GatewayBlack.com, Linton reviewed many other well established search engines such as Webwombat (Australia), Guruji (India), Jgrab (Jewish) and Ananzi. &#8220;I was well aware that GatewayBlack.com had to embrace the global Black diaspora,&#8221; said Linton. With that, the principles behind GatewayBlack.com were established. &#8220;Like many of these search engines, our hope is that GatewayBlack.com will help create an environment where promotion of one&rsquo;s heritage is seen as an invitation for learning, unity and the appreciation of shared experiences that build true understanding,&#8221; said Linton.</p>
<p>Linton believes GatewayBlack.com will appeal to the global internet community because it relies on three easy to use search engines. First, the GatewayBlack engine allows the user to search thousands of Black websites and blogs. Second, the Latest News engine crawls hundreds of Black news blogs and websites every day to obtain today&rsquo;s current events. Finally, users can search the entire web through the Web engine. Each option is available with the click of a button.</p>
<p>Additionally, GatewayBlack.com is complete with other solutions one would expect with today&rsquo;s major search engines, including free toolbars for Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer web browsers, real time top search and top domain results and easily customizable tools for webmasters. GatewayBlack.com also offers an easy to use custom designed Marketing program. In minutes, anyone seeking to launch an ad campaign directed at the global Black community online can do so through the use of a comprehensive and growing network of pre-approved websites and blogs. As a small business owner since 1998, Linton knows this will be a welcome solution for those looking to quickly and confidently reach the growing global Black online community.</p>
<p>Currently crawling thousands of Black blogs and websites, and finding more every day, Linton encourages everyone to give GatewayBlack.com a try. &#8220;We&rsquo;re a new search engine, so we welcome any suggestions.&#8221; Website and Blog owners are encouraged to join the GatewayBlack marketing program and if a search isn&rsquo;t showing a favorite website or blog, they are encouraged to submit to the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to search the web for Black websites unknown to us currently,&#8221; said Linton. &#8220;No one has to add a blog or website  &mdash;  our crawlers will find it eventually. But, we would welcome any assist!&#8221;<br>

		<p>Nice.  Any chance there will be a white search engine in the near future?  Seriously, blacks are now whining that they aren&rsquo;t being represented enough in the virtual world?  My, oh my.  Blacks are one unhappy, unforgiving, complaining, hateful race of people. Nothing ever satisifies them or shuts them up.</p>

		<p>This is really good news. Now they will have one stop shopping for all their skewed Afrocentric information.</p>
<p>They will also have easier access to valuable technical information, such as how to make those cool Haitian sandals that are made out of two-liter bottles.</p>

		<p>This character Linton refers to a global &#8220;black diaspora.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than see those Africans living in such a difficult and hostile disapora he should be encouraging them to return to the continent of their ancestors.</p>
<p>While we whites and Asians doubtless would miss them, in the long run they&rsquo;d be far happier, if far poorer, disease-ridden, and hungrier.</p>

		<p>For some reason this seems like an African scam. Who or what is putting up the money for this venture? How many blacks use, want to use a search engine? If they do, what can Obi&rsquo;s web searcher do that Google can&rsquo;t? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure one of the very first new websites that will go online, in order to take maximum advantage of this new search engine - will probably be a website named:  www.self-hating-whitechicks4whitegenocide-who-chase-black-men.com<br>

		<p>I swear of all the things i predicted would happen when Obama took office&hellip;someone&hellip;somewhere, would create a black version of google, and holy cow it happened!!<br>
Can&rsquo;t blacks find it simple enough to type in something such as &#8220;black websites&#8221; in a search bar? Thankfully most of us will forget what the website address name will be by the time we close our browser.<br>
Just when you think blacks had plenty with BET television, they need a black search engine too? The best thing that can happen out of this is there will be less blacks on any website considered white. <br>
When will we get our own search engine? Or would that be racist if we even pitched an idea?</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;I wonder how the media would cover this story to promote it for blacks? Or what kind of websites these places will TRULY be?</p>

		<p>The Internet while not perfectly anonymous is largely so.  The belief that blacks somehow don&rsquo;t get their due is absurd.  Unless one identifies oneself as a black participant or a black business there is little in the way to identify it as such.  The reason there is less black representation is either there are fewer participants or those blacks that do participate care not to identify skin color.  <br>
Seems to me that a black biased search engine is a product no one is asking for.  And if they are is the hope to find black owned business?  It is necessarily a smaller subset in the world of price comparison.  And of course a flagrantly racial biased way to shop.  It is against the very foundation of what the Internet is suppose to be; open and without bias.  It will fail.</p>

		<p>&#8220;New search engines finds black-themed websites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everytime one of these black separatist moves is pointed out I get a little more hopeful that they will all decide to have their own society.</p>
<p>I think black organizations and web sites like they are describing here is an excellent start toward nmoving blacks away from us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see FAR MORE of it.</p>

		<p>I just did a little bit of experimenting with Blackgateway.com, and the results are less than satisfactory.  </p>
<p>I started out by searching for &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221;.  You&rsquo;d think that some black somewhere just might have something to say about Taylor and company.  But not according to this website; results had a relevance of zero.</p>
<p>I ended up with doing a search on &#8220;Barack Obama&#8221;. Blackgateway.com yielded up a total of 225 hits(!), though relevance did improve marginally.</p>
<p>Unless some serious improvements are made, my guess is we won&rsquo;t be hearing too much more about this website. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no cyber expert, but based on what knowledge I have of search engines and online info retrieval, I don&rsquo;t see how &#8220;a black version of Google&#8221; can realistically do much more than what &#8220;white&#8221; Google already does. If Googling doesn&rsquo;t turn up many African-oriented websites, the answer is probably that relatively few exist. </p>
<p>People who sell drugs or are otherwise involved in crime, don&rsquo;t talk about it online   &mdash;   and people who are on welfare are generally too unmotivated and/or too dumb to start a site or a blog. If Af/Ams are only 13% of US pop&rsquo;n to begin with, and you subtract the communities involved in illegal activities that can&rsquo;t be talked about online, and also the unmotivated welfare-receiving communities, all that&rsquo;s left is a pretty small number of people who are potential site owners. </p>
<p>(I would also imagine that adding to the problem of finding black-oriented sites is that &#8220;black&#8221;   &mdash;   which might refer to all kinds of things that are black in color, not just race   &mdash;   is too ambiguous a search term.) </p>
<p>One more thing: didn&rsquo;t we read on AmRen, maybe a year or two ago, a similar story about some previous &#8220;black search engine&#8221; that was supposed to finally end the &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;inequality&#8221; of existing, &#8220;insufficiently Africanized&#8221; search engines? Whatever happened to THAT startup? </p>
