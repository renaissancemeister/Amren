<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Luis Gutierrez is pushing Harry Reid today to return to immigration legislation, on the grounds that Hispanic voters saved his hide.</p>
<p>Reid got an amazing 90% of the state&rsquo;s 12% Hispanic voters, according to exit polls; Sharron Angle got just 8%.</p>
<p>{snip} Hispanics make up over a third of the California electorate, and Meg Whitman&rsquo;s dismal peformance  &mdash;  she got just 31% of the vote  &mdash;  gave Jerry Brown his margin. Carly Fiorina got just 28%.</p>
<p>And Hispanic candidates out West didn&rsquo;t make much difference for Republicans. Brian Sandoval did better than Angle, but wound up with a mere 33% of the Hispanic vote in Nevada. Similar stats for New Mexico aren&rsquo;t available, but regional patterns suggest that Susanna Martinez didn&rsquo;t break the trend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} It&rsquo;s more a sign that many Hispanic voters simply can&rsquo;t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, whether a hard-liner like Angle or one straining to present herself as moderate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem the GOP hasn&rsquo;t solved, and one that cost them the majority in a wave year.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not that latinos can&rsquo;t bring themselves to vote for a republican.  It&rsquo;s that they cannot bring themselves to vote for a &#8220;White&#8221; person.  They know the future belongs to them, but they are impatient and want it now: the cities, the jobs, the white women, the codes for the nuclear arsenal, etc.</p>

		<p>I was trying to rack my brains trying to figure out how Nevadans could vote for Harry Reid but not for Rory Reid.  I was maybe thinking Hispanics, b/c Sandoval is Hispanic, but NV Hispanics, 12% of yesterday&rsquo;s vote, gave Angle 8% of their vote and Sandoval 33% of their vote.  So you have a 25% differential between Sandoval and Angle among 12% of the electorate, meaning only a 3% difference overall.  So Harry Reid&rsquo;s 5-point win would have still been a 2-point win even if Hispanics gave 33% of their vote to Angle like Sandoval.  Sandoval beat Rory Reid by 12 points, so that&rsquo;s a 14-point Harry-Rory differential among non-Hispanics to explain.  It means that 7% of Nevada&rsquo;s electorate, probably white people of some sort, voted for Harry Reid but not Rory Reid.  My guess is that those are moderate RINO Republicans of some sort still fuming over their inability to beat Angle in the Republican Primary.  Las Vegas has a significant black population, but I&rsquo;m assuming they voted almost universally for both Reids.</p>
<p>I am discounting voter fraud, because there were not many more total votes for Senate (704k) than for Governor (699k).  And if there was a lot of fraud, why would the fraudsters cheat for Harry and not for Rory? </p>

<p>Hispanics, like blacks, simply vote as a block and they do so for one reason and one reason only   &mdash;   race. That&rsquo;s what multiculturalism means   &mdash;   a racial street fight. And that&rsquo;s what the left has done to America.</p>

		<p>It really is insane how this happened. How could any Republican support open borders knowing (or they should know) it will usher in their death? <br>
White liberals love the fact that nonwhites vote in droves for Democrats. Think about insulated types like John Stewart whose show is lily white. How great it must be to have a treasure chest of easy votes from blacks and other nonwhites? Of course, in the long run nonwhites will have no use for any whites be they liberal or not.</p>

<p>Here we go again.. Watch the Retards (repubs) bend over backwards to pander even more to the hiss-panics  and run them as candidates in the next election. With the demographics in states like California, what do these naive White Republicans think? They think that by allowing open borders, immigration from the 3rd world a plus for winning in any future office in this country?  Especially for a WHITE man?  They have shot themselves in the foot for a long time now by promoting 3rd world immigration and not stopping the illegal aliens when they had the chance. But we all know they cannot stand to be labeled a &#8220;raciss&#8221;. They would rather lose the party and their nation.</p>

<p>The GOP could solve it by getting rid of birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants, and deporting all illegals and their anchor babies.  If the GOP hadn&rsquo;t been so much in favor of replacing their white base with Hispanics willing to work cheap they wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem of what to do about the Hispanic vote.</p>

		<p>Of all the states, it is Nevada where mestizos are leaving the fastest for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Their houses are being&hellip;.or have been&hellip;.foreclosed; and  unemployment is at record levels and climbing.</p>
<p>Unemployment officially is reported at about 14%, but like the true number of unemployed nationwide the percentage is much higher.</p>
<p>The situation will only get worse, and it will hurt the lower end workers the worst, so look for more mestizo migration.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that by 2012 the actual mestizo vote will be much smaller that it is now.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanics&#8221;?? <br>
They are more properly Mexicans, Mexican citizens who are now voting in our elections and taking control over the whores and prostitutes who call themselves politicians. <br>
The census estimates there are 45 million &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;. What percentage of them are from people who stood in line and took the citizenship test?? <br>
What percentage of them either came illegally, were &#8220;amnestied&#8221; or are &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; themselves? There must be tens of millions of &#8220;citizens&#8221; who are really the descendents of such &#8220;anchor babies&#8221;. <br>
Considering the original &#8220;birth citizenship&#8221; law was Never intended to allow this kind of invasion and what you get are not 45 million &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; citizens&hellip;.but tens of millions of Mexican citizens and their similarly non-citizen children and they are now &#8220;legally&#8221; voting in our elections. In actuality, None of them should be eligible. <br>
But it&rsquo;s too late now: the New World Order or Globalists or Marxists or Liberals have all but succeeded with their plan to merge Canada, Mexico and the US, and transform us into a Third World Dictatorship. <br>
I don&rsquo;t blame them, really, who of use wouldn&rsquo;t take advantge of all the Free stuff available in a truly civilized country? <br>
It&rsquo;s the fault of the Marxists and their conspiracies&hellip;it is treason clear and simple. <br>
So now our &#8220;representitives&#8221; bow down and grovel before a united racial pressure group of actual foreign invaders&hellip;instead of looking after US citizens. Our elections are now being decided by Mexican citizens. The invasion is successful. <br>
This is how Empires fall. Be prepared for the next, inevitable steps: increasing chaos, economic collapse, violence and the rise of the police state. Be wise. Be prepared. Be strong&hellip;for what is coming. </p>

 <br>
Open borders make it easier for employers to force pay cuts.  This benefits the only people the Republican Party really cares about. Also, the influx of Hispanics is a factor that causes white blue collar workers to vote Republican.  <br>
 <br>
In his book, What&rsquo;s the Matter with Kansas? Thomas Frank said Republicans love to lose on social issues.  The challenge for the GOP is to pretend to oppose open borders, while allowing the borders to remain open.  So far, the Republicans seem equal to the challenge.  <br>

		<p>I spoke with the campaign manager for Angle two months before the election and told him that Reid would come in with all kind of money just before the election and win by a small margin if she did not follow a suggestion I gave them for assuring victory.  They didn&rsquo;t listen.  They lost.  Same suggestion resulted in a candidate coming from nowhere to become governor of Florida a few decades ago.</p>
<p>Bottom line - What happened in Nevada is going to slowly start happening all over the country if whites don&rsquo;t unite into a &#8220;white block.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The Angle ad will go down as one of the stupidest political moves of this election cycle.  Hard to imagine there was a single person who saw the ad and liked it who was not already planning to vote against Reid.  But the fact that she did run it drove Hispanic turnout that otherwise would have been low through the roof. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem with blatant appeals to white interests: these dog whistles are heard by the other side just as loudly, and help to drive up their turnout.  What is needed is implicit, not explicit, pro-white politics.  </p>

		<p>Knowing these statistics, it would be in the GOP&rsquo;s best interests to curb the tide of Hispanic immigration, illegal or otherwise. Hispanics will be the majority ethnic group by the end of this century, which will result in a permanent Democratic Party that always wins.</p>
<p>George W. Bush tried to grant amnesty to 12,000,000+ illegal aliens, most of whom were Hispanic. John McCain advocated the same thing, but Hispanics overwhelmingly supported Obama in the 2008 election.</p>
<p>Uh, Republicans. Will you ever learn?</p>

		<p>By 2050 or so much less the end of the century, there will be a La Raza Party or somesuch.  The minorities don&rsquo;t want to continue taking orders from their Democratic handlers.</p>
<p>I remember an old Jewish Liberal in the San Fernando Valley of California a few years ago.  A Hispanic entered the race against him and gave him a serious run before losing despite being badly outspent.  &#8220;The old Jew said,&#8221;But I have done so much for these people.&#8221;  I said,&#8221;But you aren&rsquo;t one of these people and they want one of their own&hellip; not some old Jewish guy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Besides, even if it were indeed the case (that Hispanic saved Reid from the boot), why should we condone wining by treason? </p>
<p>Reid, on several occasions, sided with the Mexicans invaders. Perhaps, if (part of) the U.S. becomes a Mexican state, Reid will be offered a ruling post of that part. But the fact that treason may pay off does not imply that it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.<br>

		<p>The breakdown for Hispanics in NV was 68% Reid, 30% Angle, according to CNN&rsquo;s exit poll:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2au9gku" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2au9gku</a></p>
<p>So Angle got 30% of Hispanics in NV, while Sandoval got 33% of Hispanics in NV.  Comparable.  Amazingly, Asians voted 79% for Reid, and I can explain that in two words:  Manny Pacquiao.  NV has a big Filipino population, and Pacquiao pushed hard for Reid.  Also, Pacquiao is a Filipino Congressman, so he as a foreign politician electioneering in an American election is probably a Federal crime.  And it&rsquo;s an example of &#8220;foreign influence&#8221; that Democrats supposedly despise.</p>
