			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Forliti, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), November 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Twenty-nine people have been indicted in a sex trafficking ring in which Somali gangs in Minneapolis allegedly forced girls under age 14 into prostitution in Minnesota, Tennessee, Ohio and other unnamed places, according to an indictment unsealed Monday.</p>
<p>The indictment, unsealed in U.S. District Court in the Middle District of Tennessee, said one of the gangs&rsquo; goals was recruiting females under age 18, including some under age 14, and forcing them into prostitution in exchange for cash, drugs or other items.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The indictment claims three Minneapolis-based gangs were involved  &mdash;  The Somali Outlaws, the Somali Mafia and the Lady Outlaws  &mdash;  and that the gangs are connected. It outlines several instances when young girls were told to engage in sex acts for money, marijuana or liquor.</p>
<p>In one case in 2005, a 13-year-old girl was taken from Minneapolis to Columbus, Ohio, and Nashville for sex.</p>
<p>In another case, a girl was under age 13 when she was first forced to engage in sex acts in November 2006. Over time, she was taken to multiple locations and forced to engage in sex acts with multiple males. {snip}</p>

		<p>This comes as no surprise.  </p>
<p>Somalis are fiercely nationalistic about their race, and regard their tribal laws as supreme over ours.</p>
<p>Women are chattel in their society.  Anywhere these nomads land, drug dealing and violence follows.  Under the Islamic laws they follow, free women are unclean and may be treated as prostitutes. </p>
<p>The males begin in their teens, offering drugs and other enticements to lure vulnerable girls.  White girls are seen as prey.   </p>

When you remove the 10 commandments, when you can&rsquo;t say a prayer at school functions, when movies and TV show &#8220;everything&#8221;, when diversity is pushed, when MORAL ABSOLUTES are compromised away, what results can you expect.  Answer - stuff like this. </p>

		<p>Would someone please tell me what Somalis are doing in this country?  Whose idiot idea was it to let them in?  I am afraid we are stuck with the blacks whose ancestors came here as slaves.  Abraham Lincoln and others had the right idea that they should be sent back to Africa.  It is too late now.<br>
 <br>
There is absolutely no reason that we should allow black immigration.  Those people are a blight to every country they live in.  We do not need more of their crime, welfare dependency, and low intelligence.  </p>

<p>This is a violation of the Mann Act. Transportation of persons overstate lines for immoral purposes. Same law that was used to prosecute the &#8220;great&#8221; boxer Jack Johnson. What do you want to bet these guys get charged with lesser offenses?</p>

<p>No, actually I lived in Minneapolis for three years. It&rsquo;s a veritable United Nations, with lots of every race living there. Mixed-race couples are quite common, but they mostly involve either two flavors of minority or a white man and a nonwhite woman; most whites seem to keep increasingly to themselves. Unlike black Americans, it seems that Somali men overwhelmingly prefer their own women. If anything, it&rsquo;s the Somali girls, not the boys, who tend to flirt with whites. My guess is that they&rsquo;re pimping out Somali girls (possibly from clans hostile to their own back in the old country) to Somalis and American blacks.</p>

		<p>I understand that Church and other Christian humanitarian aid groups have been encouraging this influx of Somalis. Are these groups prepared to make some sort of explanation for all of this.</p>
<p>There is literature in my household encouraging and telling us all about adoption of Somali babies (How cute etc) in the USA. (It is generaly not permitted here). Some time ago I expressed my reservations about this but my comments were NOT appreciated.</p>
<p>2, A tale of 2 well publicised motor accidents, both TRAGIC. 1, A Somali woman ran over and killed a white female 20 y/o student here in Sydney, no charges were laid against the driver and there was remarkable forgiveness and apologies all round. 2, In Melbourne a few days ago a young Australian male driver was jailed for 8 years for killing a Somali child, result of admitted reckless driving in a suburban street. It was interesting to note that the local Somali community in Melbourne was out in force demanding this young mans blood.</p>

		<p>@ on the lam&hellip;   ol dishonest Abe had nothing to do with repatriation of blacks - the Confederacy was already instituting a plan for same and had even purchased land in africa for settlements. The people running that venture soon found out that the blacks were mostly incapable of productive, civilised society, but at least the effort was made.<br>
This of course doesnt negate your assertion that repatriation is desirable ; it certainly is that! But lets give credit where its due please.</p>

		<p>For too long now we have stood by as the Progressives and &#8220;Humanitarian&#8221; groups have inflitrated our country with the lowest common denominator of Third World society who bring with them all their social and so called &#8220;religious&#8221; pathologies. <br>
It&rsquo;s bad enough that we have to endure the constant and ever more violent depredations of our own home grown sub-humans such as the just completed trial of that mutant Hayes in Connecticut and the often mention abominations in Knoxville, Wichita, the murders of Police officers in Washington state, Eve Carson, Lauren Burk and on and on and on.<br>
The Progressive agenda is all too clear. They select areas that are predominantly White and move these primitives in and within a short space of time these areas become unlivable and the White flight begins. Years of Progressive indoctrination and namby pamby &#8220;turning the other cheek&#8221; has made cowards of us all. We are doomed unless to quote from Hamlet we &#8221; take up arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing, end them.&#8221; or as Richard III remarks &#8220;Instead of mounting barbed steed to fright the souls of fearful adverseries&hellip;.&#8221;, we sit in front of our TVs mesmerized by NFL, NBA, NHA and reality shows. <br>
Returning to the trial in Connecticut it was sad to see the attitude of the jurors who spoke of their inner conflict in making a decision to take a human life. Maybe we need to set standards for what constitutes human behavior. HOw could anyone sit through the days of descriptions of the horrors that Mrs. Pettit and her two girls endured and still view that beast as a &#8220;human&#8221;? I&rsquo;m sad to say that Christianity has turned White people into a nation of milquetoasts. </p>

		<p><i>Would someone please tell me what Somalis are doing in this country? Whose idiot idea was it to let them in?</i></p>
<p>Your government let them in and is on its way to opening the doors to even more backwards Somali/Bantu: </p>
<p><i>The U.S. is planning to re-open family reunification for refugees suspended two years ago after the rate of fraudulent family claims was found to be as high as 90 percent among Somali refugees.</i></p>
<p><i>With the new regulations DNA evidence of the claimed parent-child relationships must be established.  Most of our current refugee influx is from polygamous societies which complicates the process further. No DNA verification is needed for refugees and asylees who petition for relatives to come over under the I-730 program.</i></p>
<p>It is a pretty sure thing that the U.S. taxpayer will pick up the entire tab for the DNA testing program.</p>
<p>You can also thank the Congressional Black Caucus, controlled by non-black subversives whose main goal is to destroy white America:</p>
<p><i>According to &#8220;The New Face of America&rsquo;s Refugees: African Refugee Resettlement to the United States&#8221;, much of the responsibility for how we switched from a European/Asian centered refugee program to one with a large African refugee component and be blamed on the Congressional Black Caucus.</i></p>
<p><i>&hellip;.several of the individuals identified the Congressional Black Caucus as one of the most influential groups advocating over the past decade for increased African refugee resettlement to the United States.</i></p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget this:  <i>Refugees are eligible for ALL federal, state and local welfare programs 30 days after arrival.</i></p>
<p>So there you have it.   Don&rsquo;t you feel better now knowing that you are working to welcome even more backwards Somalis into your very neighborhood, into your white children&rsquo;s school, their 10 children, all of their relatives and that you will be paying for their welfare benefits forever? </p>
<p>And, since Somali/Bantu refugees do not fit into &#8220;traditional&#8221; black communities in the US, expect them to be resettled into your white community!  </p>

		<p>I work in Portland Maine.  Catholic Charities of Maine is the largest importer of Somalies around here.  Not to bash Catholics as the Protestant churches are also doing their best to destroy America.  It makes them feel good to help people even while it hurts the rest of the people.  From their website ( http://www.ccmaine.org/info.php?info_id=73 ) with a picture of little Africans with big smiles that they will be coming to America to get free housing, free cars, free food and free health care; the Catholic Charities of Maine says:<br>
&#8220;Since 1975, Catholic Charities Maine Refugee and Immigration Services has been the primary provider of resettlement services to refugees in Maine. Catholic Charities Maine resettles refugees of all races, religions and ethnicities. More than 5,000 newcomers from two dozen countries of Southeast Asia, Africa, the Near East, Eastern Europe, Cuba, and the former Soviet Republics have been assisted by these services to start new lives in Maine.&#8221;<br>
And:<br>
&#8220;Catholic Charities Maine is the only agency in Maine authorized to administer the federal program that resettles refugees in this country. Realizing that many of these clients arrive in Maine with few possessions, and often have suffered trauma and loss of family members, our Refugee and Immigration staff works with them to access housing, English skills, jobs, and medical and mental health services that will allow them to begin a new life here and become part of the community in which they live.&#8221;<br>
Show us the money:<br>
&#8220;How Refugees Arrive and What Services they Qualify for:  </p>
<p><br>
• When a primary refugee arrives in Maine, RIS case managers will receive notice of their arrival from the VOLAG in Washington, DC, up to two weeks prior to their arrival. RIS case managers will find and prepare their housing, furnish their homes with donated furniture, buy food for them that is culturally appropriate to the arriving refugee, greet them at the airport, assist them in receiving health care, finding employment, enrolling children in schools, referring adults in the family to English language learning programs, and assist them in life skills and cultural orientations.&#8221;<br>
Enough to make you sick.  They get free health care and often will bring their entire families into the local hospital Emergency Room at all hours of the day and night for sniffles and tummy aches.  That&rsquo;s around $1000.00 free &#8220;emergency&#8221; medical care per each family member paid for by the American tax payer. </p>

		<p>The government warning about traveling to Somalia is very clear, this African country is extremely dangerous with the high risks of terrorism, clan-based ethnic fighting, kidnapping and piracy off the coast.</p>
<p>Somalia&rsquo;s capital Mogadishu is also the capital of all those above mentioned crimes. The city is almost destroyed because of ongoing civil war. According to United Nations city&rsquo;s half population (0.5 million) had migrated from the battlefield capital. Everyday dozens of people get injured and many die because of frequent bombings.</p>
<p>Since 1991 when president Siad Barre was overthrown one million people had lost their lives in Somalia due to this evil war. There is doubt about that Mogadishu is one of the most dangerous cities in the world.<br>

		<p>You see&hellip;this is what happens when countries let in &#8220;unskilled laborers&#8221;. They have nothing else to do, they don&rsquo;t want an education, they hate America so this is what we get. USA has to understand that the immigrants of long ago (those that came thru Ellis Island) are finished. Those immigrants &#8220;really&#8221; came for the betterment of America. These immigrants now just want to take advantage of America and any other country they can get into. I am for immigration, but controlled immigration, and right now the control they need to do is &#8220;stop immigration for now&#8221;&hellip;pitiful really.</p>

		<p>What is sad to me is that my beloved ancestral Finns were limited to a total of 529 immigrants per year to the US in 1929 (I would venture to guess this quota has been lifted now).  Meanwhile hundreds of Mexicans cross the border every day, and somehow there are thousands of Somalis in America.  </p>

		<p>M #20: I am a Catholic Traditionalist and I am opposed to any non-White immigration to this Country. </p>
<p>I believe in Charity first to my own, within my home, then extended family, the Neighbors, and friends, and finally those Whites that I meet, or hear about, and contribute as I can. </p>
<p>Blacks and every other non-White Race have loads of programs and hand-outs, that Whites who have paid taxes their entire working lives cannot seem to qualify for, even after losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Catholic Charities was also a big supporter of Amnesty for Illegal Aliens. When I read this, I saw red. That was it. I called a local Catholic Charities office to confirm that they did indeed support Amnesty, and the woman replied, &#8220;yes&#8221;. </p>
<p>I told her that as an American, and as a Catholic, I did not appreciate Catholic Charities aiding those that ignored our laws, and crossed our borders, while committing other crimes, lowering the standard wages of pay for American workers, and taking many jobs away. </p>
<p>No, I told her that I would never contribute to Catholic Charities again, until they do a 180 degree turn around on their current policies.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that the Red Cross also has the same policies toward Amnesty, etc., as Catholic Charities does. Keep that in mind when you think about donating toward Good Will, during the Thanksgiving and Christmas Season. </p>

		<p>I agree with the assessment on the Catholic Church, and other churches such as the Lutheran. The missionary spirit seems to have been inverted and its efforts redirected toward white people and their nations. <br>
It is reminiscent of Trotsky&rsquo;s famous quip:&#8221;.. You say you are not interested in war, and maybe so, but war is interested in you&hellip;&#8221;<br>
 Substitute &#8220;religion&#8221; for &#8220;war&#8221; and you get the feeling. Maybe the two are more closely related than is comfortable.<br>

		<p>This is just the worst and most notable of a whole string of incidents involving Somalis from the Minneapolis area. Their various escapades have become something of a regular item in the local news.</p>
<p>Of course if they ever come to power in this country the diversity-celebrating liberals, gays and feminists will be the first to be done away with.</p>

		<p>The Portland, and greater Portland, Seattle region had 26 of the 69 girls in the latest FBI sting that has been in the news this week.  The news also mentioned Minnesota, and that girls are often moved around the country.  The film clips I have seen showed a few very blonde young women - girls, walking and the men arrested as pimps, black.</p>
<p>We had a local story here this year about a bunch of young guys who went up to the greater Seattle area to &#8220;rescue&#8221; a girl they knew who had been led into prostitution by a couple of Pakistani immigrants.  The girl was in high school and working at a local restaurant.  The guys complimented her, flirteded, got her number, etc.  Soon, they came back and picked her up, took her to a home in the great Seattle area, had sex with her, then set her to strip in a club.  Her friends intervened and beat the tar out of these two guys, just as they were beginning to pimp her out.  They succeeded with her because they told her that they would attack her family if she did not comply.  That is exactly how the Russian mafia and other ogranized sex crime syndicates in other regions like the Balkans, Europe, and even Turkey do it.  </p>
<p>It is here at out door.  But I cheered these young guys who went out after their friend and risked arrest, etc., in order to save her.  They faced some charges, but I think they were dismissed in light of the defense of another.   Yes, we need our young men to be MEN.  </p>

		<p>Note there are 400 so called &#8220;charities&#8221; sponsoring refugees.<br>
The sole income for many of these groups is the refugee<br>
racket. Requests have been made that these &#8220;charities&#8221;<br>
spend at least some of their own money..they have refused.<br>
Taxpayers are presented with an inflated bill for &#8220;services<br>
that the charities provide&hellip;.&#8221;furnished apartment&#8221; will<br>
be billed to the Govt at $5000..but will consist of <br>
$200 in broken down furniture purchased from Goodwill and<br>
a $400 tenement rental&hellip;the rest is pocketed by the &#8220;charity&#8221;.<br>
When the maximum billable amount is reached..the &#8220;charity&#8221; <br>
moves on to the next incoming group. Furthermore the US citizen<br>
has no say in the process at all&hellip;the list of refugees originates in the UN and is handed directly to the President for<br>
rubber stamp approval. Congress is consulted briefly but has<br>
no say in the matter. Nice eh?</p>

		<p>I wonder if they are operating out of Riverside Towers?</p>
<p>Remember the Mary Tyler Moore show&hellip;</p>
<p><i>In 1975, Mary Tyler Moore left her exclusive Kenwood pad for a new upscale high-rise apartment in the <b>Riverside Towers</b>. The key features of these towers were the bright multicolor panels on the building that was supposed to cheer up and inspire people.</i></p>
<p>The reality is that much of the 14 tower urban village never materialized. Today, the buildings are rundown, shabby, and infested with gangs. It is a modern urban ghetto that the locals call the &#8216;crack stack&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Location: Northeast corner of I-94 and I-35W interchange in Minneapolis, take the Cedar Ave exit from I-94. </p>
<p>Sic transit&hellip;</p>

<p>I agree with Anonymous 18. Large concentrations of Whites are considered a threat to the Progressive agenda. They need to be broken up.<br>

 <br>
The New Deal was only possible because civil rights legislation was kept off the agenda.  Social Democracy has only worked in countries where the vast majority of the population is white.  Millions of blacks will take advantage of a welfare state by quitting the low wage jobs they are capable of performing and going on welfare like they did in the United States in the late 1960s.  <br>
 <br>
Blacks do not advance the progressive agenda.  They make it impossible.  </p>

		<p>  When one considers that many of these Somalians were sponsered by &#8220;religious&#8221; groups, it makes one just desire to stop going to church altogether.  House churches may be the wave of the future for Christians who are FED UP with DIE-versity.  I suppose the Marxist trolls that are dissolving white, European-based nations will attempt to ban these churches as some kind of &#8220;extremist groups!&#8221; Can these creeps realize we just want to be left alone?</p>
