			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tudor Cozm, staho.com, November 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The USA Green Card Lottery just hit a new record: this year, 15 million people worldwide applied for a green card. The &#8220;diversity visa program&#8221; is in fact a government program that offers permanent U.S. residence to 50,000 people a year, randomly selecting the lucky winners. According to the State Department, this year&rsquo;s green card lottery drew nearly 25 percent more applicants than last year. However, some lawmakers now call for an end to the immigration program.</p>
<p>Each year, the green card lottery causes a rage all across the developing world, with millions of applicants rushing to fill out online applications in hopes of winning a USA green card. This year the one-month enrollment ended November 3, and in the last hours 62,000 applications were submitted per hour. However, many critics argue that the government program poses major security risks by luring uneducated immigrants and allowing individuals worldwide to enter the country more quickly than others sponsored by employers or relatives. Also, the USA green card lottery has given an opportunity to many con artists to create hundreds of phishing sites and Internet scams.</p>
<p>The green card lottery program was launched in 1990 to promote diversity in the immigrant population. Now, it is open to people worldwide, except countries like Mexico, China, India and the Philippines, that already boast a great number of nationals in the U.S. Millions of people chase &#8220;The American Dream&#8221;, and the USA green card lottery is even more appealing as it doesn&rsquo;t require any special skills, a high school diploma will do. The green card is often just the first step for someone who dreams of becoming a US citizen. Applying for US citizenship is the next step for many lottery winners.</p>
<p>The number of applications has been rising each year, and this year&rsquo;s total was more than 2.5 times greater than five years ago. According to Mark Jacobsen, an immigration lawyer, the program costs nothing to enter and is the fastest way to get a green card and live in the United States, and is becoming increasingly more popular worldwide.</p>
<p>The draw will be made electronically and about 100,000 applicants will be notified in May and scheduled to undergo interviews, background checks and medical exams. Half of them will be eligible to move to the U.S. Although there is no cap on how many times can an individual enter the lottery, no country can represent more than seven percent of the total visas issued in one year.<br>

		<p>So all those people are waiting for a chance to get into the U.S. while we have all those illegals who will stay here while we figure how to give them a &#8220;Path to Citizenship&#8221;. These people are chumps! They ought to just walk over the border and claim the right to stay. The Mexicans do not bother with &#8220;interviews, background checks and medical exams&#8221;</p>

<p>You care to wager any money on it?  Even though the diversity visa program, unlike the H-1B program, doesn&rsquo;t require a sponsor, I get the feeling that they&rsquo;re not coming over here without a promise of some job from some business, who doesn&rsquo;t want to pay a native born white American a living family wage or salary.  If not for that, there&rsquo;s always good ole welfare.</p>

<p>Saying you &#8220;get the feeling&#8221; that they are going to be promised work doesn&rsquo;t sound to me like you&rsquo;re too confident of your information, old boy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d advise you to wake up and realize that the government is simply &#8220;spinning&#8221; a happy face on the economy.  The economy is going to go into the tank, and if you think this country will be able to support thousands of foreigners when 41 million of it&rsquo;s own citizens are drawing welfare, with the number growing larger every month, then I&rsquo;d advise you to not bet your money and save it instead.  You might get a good offer on something like the Brooklyn bridge.<br>

<p>They aren&rsquo;t coming here to get a job or the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; in the first place. They all hear from their family already here how easy it is to get welfare, SSA, and all the other freebies to begin with. There is no American Dream for us white Americans (as it was intended for in the first place) because it has been turned into the American Nightmare all because of bringing in these tens of millions of 3rd worlders.</p>

		<p>So who is going to let us know when we reach so called proper &#8220;diversity?&#8221; Isn&rsquo;t that the justification behind this so called &ldquo;diversity lottery?&rdquo;  Whites are now a minority in many places, replaced by third world illegal invaders from mexico. </p>
<p>I suspect this has been the real definition of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; all along. Replace whitey. Is there any other way to see it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered how the Vietnamese who were boat lifted here in the late 70&rsquo;s early 80&rsquo;s succeeded so rapidly. Most of them came here with only the clothes on their backs and did not speak a word of English. Within three years they all had their own business (dry cleaners, donut shop, nail salons or liquor stores were the most common) and were driving a Mercedes Benz.</p>
<p>Of course they caught on quick by hiring only family members or illegal aliens to work in their businesses.  </p>
<p>Would have taken an American citizen decades to have realized the same success. </p>
<p>How&rsquo;d that happen? What kinds of loans or grants are these people being given that obviously are not available to White Americans?<br>
