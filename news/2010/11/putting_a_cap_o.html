			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Will Connors, Wall Street Journal, Nov. 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This megacity&rsquo;s motorcycle taxis are so dangerous that local hospitals have special orthopedic wards meant just for people who have suffered accidents while riding them. So you&rsquo;d think a law requiring passengers to wear helmets would be well received.</p>
<p>But it turns out that, for many Nigerians, the only thing scarier than a motorcycle taxi is a motorcycle helmet. Many people refuse to wear them out of fear of juju, or supernatural powers. Some fret that previous passengers may have put nefarious juju spells on the helmets to steal someone&rsquo;s good fortune, or to make a person disappear in order to be used in a sacred ritual, say motorcycle taxi drivers and passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our people are quite superstitious about anything dealing with their head,&#8221; says Ralph Ibuzo, a 43-year-old architect whose closely cropped hair is beginning to gray. &#8220;People believe that if you put on a helmet, [others] can take away your brain, or your good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Mr. Ibuzo created the &#8220;Original Lapa Guard,&#8221; a cloth cap that he claims can protect wearers from disease and sudden disappearance. The cloth provides a thin layer of separation between the head and a helmet full of potential trouble. </p>
<p>The biggest city in sub-Saharan Africa is a cosmopolitan place, home to millions of Christians and Muslims, renowned musicians and artists, and professionals commuting to work in designer clothes. But the fear of juju isn&rsquo;t new here, and product roll outs have been tricky. Indomie, now the market leader in instant noodles, was at first rumored to contain worms from Asia. When condom distribution drives picked up in the 1990s, talk was that men using them would vanish. And when mobile phones became popular, some said certain numbers meant a person was going to die. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Juju is widely feared in Nigeria and throughout West Africa, but that isn&rsquo;t commonly acknowledged among city sophisticates. </p>
<p>&#8220;Some people blame juju [for bad things], others don&rsquo;t. But juju is real,&#8221; insists Israel Alofohkai, an okada union secretary in the Onigbongbo area of Lagos, who has started selling Mr. Ibuzo&rsquo;s caps. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very rampant.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On a recent sweltering day, sales rep Mercy Obi picked up a box of caps and walked into the Ketu neighborhood of Lagos to make some sales. She says she tends to avoid extolling the caps&rsquo; use against juju because she doesn&rsquo;t want to be responsible if something does happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t tell them about rituals and juju because they might believe us and it might still not work,&#8221; Ms. Obi said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though Mr. Ibuzo says concerns surrounding juju-laced helmets will fade over time as they have with other products in Nigeria, some of his sales people are striking while the issue is hot. At a party last week, Adewumi Momoh, a marketer working for Mr. Ibuzo, hired the emcee of the event to talk up the Original Lapa Guard. &#8220;He would say, &#8216;Somebody disappeared yesterday. You want to disappear? You want craw craw [infection]?&rsquo; People said, &#8216;Nooo!&rsquo; so he says, &#8216;Come, buy this thing.&rsquo; And they rushed to buy it.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Umm, yes, a bit of bad ju-ju certainly might accompany the wearing of motorcycle helmets.  Don&rsquo;t want to alarm the locals by our insensitivities to their beliefs. </p>
<p>Perhaps we could encourage them, by way of celebrating their African heritage, to cultivate their hair in the style of the Afro, so popular in the Seventies in this country.  A large Afro certainly would provide a certain level of cranial protection during violent impacts, plus prominently displaying black pride on the head of the wearer.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true.  The more sophisticated believe that if they build concrete runways whitey will come with briefcases full of money cuuse that&rsquo;s how wealth is created.  And they also believe if a black pilot forgets to pop the top on his airplane or forgets to lower his wheels on landing it&rsquo;s due to white racism.</p>
<p>And the other sophisticates in the US believe whites blew up the levees in N.O. and introduced drugs and aids in black neighborhoods to kill off blacks.</p>
<p>See?  Haven&rsquo;t they improved greatly over the inhabitants of the old country?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about bad JuJu or MoJo but there is no way I would put on a motorcycle helmet that had been worn by a bunch of Nigerians.</p>
<p>Their reasoning may not be sound but still it&rsquo;s not a good idea to wear any kind of head gear that&rsquo;s been worn by lots of other people. No telling what kind of disease you could catch.  </p>

		<p>or to make a person disappear in order to be used in a sacred ritual</p>
<p>Note this subtle form of propaganda.  Use of the word &#8220;sacred&#8221; as opposed to satanic.  These rituals, involving the murder and dismemberment of innocent people, are done by criminals who specifically identify themselves as satanists.  They are literally satanic, not just in character but in content.  The specific intent is a sacrifice to the devil.  That important point is being covered up subtly here.  Also, the intent, as crazy and outrageous as it sounds, is to promote acceptance of ritualized murder&hellip;.by using the specific term sacred here.  This is a form of extreme moral relativism being implanted subconsciously.  Even though this is sick, insane, evil behavior, it&rsquo;s &#8220;sacred&#8221; to someone via their opinion.  Moral relative to their own value system rather than objectively and inherently evil.  The one writing the article knows this and is attempting to manipulate people reading the article.</p>
<p>What does that say about the writer?  This is an extremely important thing to notice.</p>
<p>Also, this is a REASONABLE fear to have in Africa.  By lumping it in with a bunch of irrational fears, the writer of this article covers up the fact that people living in africa have to worry about such things.  More to the point, by bringing these people to the western world, we risk having this happen here.</p>

		<p>Not surprising really, typical of the African mindset. In Rhodesia, when there was still some sanity there, the black workers had to have their beds up on stilts so that the &#8220;tikilo&#8221;, a small dwarf demon, would not be able to reach them while sleeping and perform whatever nasty deeds they did to them.  The workers became terrified if tree branches brushed against the windows as the tree spirits may do them harm. We had to have workers keep them trimmed back or the blacks would flee in fear during windy storms and never return to work. They indeed had the minds of small children. Time has proven that no amount of instruction, teaching, or help will cause them to change or improve their ways.</p>

<p>Which goes first  &mdash;  the goinage or the brain?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is much brain there to begin with.</p>

		<p>I could see not wearing a publicly used helmet to avoid things like head lice, etc. But that is all. What we need to understand is that these people have a different mentality.</p>

<p>  Those among us who haven&rsquo;t lived in the Deep South could be unaware of the extent of African superstition among American blacks. In Louisiana we have Gris-gris, which is the &#8220;Root&#8221; in the coastal Carolinas. These enduring beliefs are directly imported from Africa, and have resisted rational extermination for centuries. Of course, many city Southern blacks are more dismissive of Voodoo and Hoodoo, but I guarantee they are not unaware of it  &mdash;  and fear it! Where you find blacks, there you find Africa. Having lived among Southern blacks for a long time, I know enough about this stuff to make a good living as a &#8220;Houngan&#8221;.  Sometimes, I wish I knew less about these practices. </p>

		<p>They wear baseball caps sideways or backwards here in the USA; maybe wearing motorcycle helmets sideways or backwards would help over there.  It would be very considerate if they would try it and tell us how it works out.</p>
