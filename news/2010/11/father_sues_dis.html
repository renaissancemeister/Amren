<h1>Father Sues District Over Reading About Slavery</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KMGH-TV (Denver), Nov. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The father of a black student has sued a Detroit-area school district claiming that his daughter was racially harassed by a fifth-grade teacher&rsquo;s reading aloud from a book about slavery.</p>
<p>The suit claims Jala Petree&rsquo;s teacher at Margaret Black Elementary School in Sterling Heights read excerpts from Julius Lester&rsquo;s &#8220;From Slave Ship to Freedom Road&#8221; that contain racial epithets and racist characterizations, The Macomb Daily reported.</p>
<p>The suit against Warren Consolidated Schools was filed Nov. 3 in Macomb County Circuit Court in Mount Clemens, according to court records. It was filed by Jala&rsquo;s father, Jamey Petree, and seeks more than $50,000 in damages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The reading was from supplemental material provided by a textbook company, Freehan said, and following the reading students were involved in what he called a &#8220;positive&#8221; discussion about the excerpts.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims the reading has &#8220;affected the conditions of learning duties and the advantages of her further education, and seriously affected her mental and emotional well-being, past, present and future.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The real issue here is that Blacks were the slaves and Whites the slave owners. If the so called politically incorrect teacher had gotten it backwards [as most do now a days] there would have been praise.</p>
<p>The one comforting thing about the story, is that in Detroit, presumably, there is at least one teacher, somewhere, who can [apparently] read on a fifth grade level. That, in and of itself, [if true] would have been the real story   &mdash;   particularly if the teacher were B&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. well you know.  </p>

		<p>What is her GPA?  What was yours Mr. Petree?  Seriously, those two factors tend to tell me more about little Jala&rsquo;s potential future than any Ghetto Lottery reaction to epithets spoken more than a 150 years ago.</p>
<p>Grow up young woman, in your lifetime people are gonna say a lot of ugly things within range of your hearing.  Less than a 10th of which will have thing-one to do with your race so much as their mood and the situation of the moment.</p>
<p>Grow up.  This is history about how far you have come.  Not an excuse to indulge exploitationist profit motive as some form of inherited PTSD hysteria.</p>

		<p>Hoist by their own petard!  The PC libs try to teach about slavery and get sued for racist abuse!  Of course, they&rsquo;d be sued for racism if they refused to teach about slavery.  Nice to see them getting it for their efforts at teaching political correctness.  Maybe they should lay off the cultural indoctrination aimed at turning kids into Democrats, and instead teach kids to read, write and solve math problems so that they can get good-paying jobs, instead of ending up as Democrats on welfare.</p>

HOW many times have we been told that American blacks do poorly because they don&rsquo;t know their history?</p>
<p>Teaching black history is supposed to transform black children into high achievers. That&rsquo;s why blacks all over the US are demanding black history as a part of school studies.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The lawsuit claims the reading has &ldquo;affected the conditions of learning duties and the advantages of her further education, and seriously affected her mental and emotional well-being, past, present and future.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>One reason to give up black studies; it&rsquo;s bad for the mental health of black students.</p>

		<p>Other articles on this case say the readings were taken from Julius Lester&rsquo;s book, &#8220;From Slave Ship to Freedom Road,&#8221; reviewed at amazon.com:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slave-Ship-Freedom-Road/product-reviews/0140566694/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Slave-Ship-Freedom-Road/product-reviews/0140566694/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some excerpts from the reviews:</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&rsquo;t for little kids&hellip;To be on the safe side, sending permission slips home to parents might be a good idea. This is powerful, expect to see emotions from your students. I would not use it with students any younger than 8th grade, and that might be pushing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;superb paintings of Rod Brown&hellip;creates images that are often disturbing and graphic: men chained together like cargo in a slave ship&rsquo;s hold, a slave&rsquo;s back bloody with fresh welts, etc&hellip;.At times, I felt that Lester&rsquo;s text was a bit too racially charged (for example, he includes separate &#8216;Imagination Exercises&rsquo; for black and white readers).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;mental exercises of Black pretend vs. White pretend,(e.g. If you are Black could you ever whip someone until their flesh bled red or if you are White could you toss a sick human overboard). Most importantly, this book should not be presented without parental consent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have used this book for years with middle grade students. It is to be used cautiously&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;some of the content is tear-jerking and painful,..&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This book was moving and hurtful&hellip;I am still hurt by what I saw and read. A must have for every American.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen a &#8216;children&rsquo;s&rsquo; book so powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that when I was 10 years old I was reading Zane Grey, where death and brutality were romanticized. I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about teaching stuff like this to 10 year olds, but I think I&rsquo;m agin&rsquo; it. Whatever the politics of it.</p>

		<p>What on earth does a teacher think she&rsquo;s doing by conducting social engineering sessions instead of teaching kids about the important points of history?</p>
<p>Her brainwashing has gotten her in trouble.  She regards lamenting about some perceved injustice as a good replacement for educating students in subjects that will do them some good.</p>

<p>But I doubt any of this matters, as WaPo reports this about students in Detroit:</p>
<p><i>About 97 percent of juniors failed state math tests last year, and about 80 percent failed in English.</i></p>
<p>And</p>
<p><i>Thirty-eight percent of Detroit&rsquo;s ninth-graders get a high school diploma within four years&hellip; that puts the city&rsquo;s on-time graduation rate below that of Baltimore (42 percent) and D.C. public schools (58 percent).</i></p>
<p>But, according to Arne Duncan, US Secretary of Education:  &#8220;the hope is to transform Detroit public schools from a &#8216;national disgrace&rsquo; to a &#8216;national model.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yeah!  Rotsa Ruck!</p>
<p>As for Detroit Schools, here is what a  typical classrooms looks like at the end of the day:</p>

		<p>I feel for the girl.  Learning that your African cousins sold you to the White People for profit must be very hard to take and emotionally devastating, especially when you&rsquo;ve been taught all your life that the Whites &#8220;stole&#8221; you from Africa.  She should be given $500,000, instead of $50,000.</p>
<p>When I study slavery, I suffer from mental and emotional distress.  To realize that my White Ancestors actually allowed their country to import black Africans from Africa causes me much agony.  And then to learn that we didn&rsquo;t send the blacks back to blackest Africa when we had the chance and need is most heart-breaking of all.  I&rsquo;m owed $5,000,000 every time I&rsquo;m forced to encounter these hard realities.<br>

		<p> Is this story some kind of a joke? Blacks don&rsquo;t want to hear about slavery?! They LOVE to hear about slavery, to wallow in their victimhood, to keep reminding us of it, to use it as an excuse for affirmative action, busing, race norming, &#8220;sensitivity training,&#8221; and, if we let them get away with it, some day, reparations. Slavery is their hole card, the historical fact that makes their constant complaining, threats and shakedowns possible.</p>
<p> How about the school district promising it will never, ever teach anything about slavery to its students again? And, maybe, an admission that the actions of a few of the ancestors of a few of us, in bringing the first Africans over here, was the biggest single mistake ever made on American soil.</p>

		<p>Perhaps if they made it more balanced by pointing out that the black slaves were already slaves in Africa and so weren&rsquo;t &#8216;enslaved&rsquo; by the White Man then it would be less traumatic for the children?</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that there are more slaves today than ever before, and nearly all of it is perpetrated by non-Whites. In fact the state of Niger, where a lot of African American&rsquo;s ancestors originally came from still to this day practices slavery openly.</p>
<p>They could also point out that their lives in the continental U.S. were much better than in their original homeland of Africa as chattel slavery was better for the slave than common slavery as the slave is seen as property that must be cared for.</p>
<p>Please note that I&rsquo;m not defending slavery, merely trying spread the blame to all involved while also promoting a greater understanding of events and customs around those times.</p>

		<p>Another case of damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. Every school district in this nation should use this law suit as a reason to stop teaching about slavery, period. Then maybe little blonde haired, blue eyed Jane will never learn to hate herself and feel guilty about things she had nothing to do with.</p>
<p>No, that won&rsquo;t work. They&rsquo;ll just sue any school district that doesn&rsquo;t teach about slavery, because little Jane NEEDS to know how evil she and her kind are.</p>

		<p>The girl should be institutionalized. No newspapers, no TV, no internet, no contact of any kind with the frightning outside world. All items that she comes in contact with should be made of nerf. Heavy on the valium. The father on the other hand should be made to work in a coal mine (at a quarter of the prevailing rate), instead of looking for a fast buck. In fairness, he should be allowed to retire at age 90, providing black lung doesn&rsquo;t do him in first.  </p>

		<p>This and every other story here on AmRen concerning blacks in America is a caution to &#8220;Begin as you mean to continue&#8221;. Meaning that black African slaves were brought to the New World as chattel slavery, and while I in no way condone slavery, the fact is that the slaves&rsquo; every need (not want) was provided by the owner. Their food, clothing, housing, medical care, education in a trade (cook, nanny, blacksmith, etc.) was given to them. The further fact is we are STILL providing all these things to their descendants. At what point does this stop, and they are taught to take care of themselves like adults?</p>

		<p>Perhaps a far better and up-to-date read would be &#8216;The Fate Of Africa&rsquo;, A history of 50 years of independence. This by Martin Meredith and at 752 pages would keep Jala Petree busy for several more grades. The lawsuit claims the reading has &ldquo;affected the conditions of learning duties and the advantages of her further education, and seriously affected her mental and emotional well-being, past, present and future.&rdquo; Huh!! wait until she reads about the past 50 years of blacks under black african rule, she will really weep, that&rsquo;s assuming she actually understands the content, being mentally shattered and all that mumbo-jumbo. </p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but this one DOES throw me. I thought embellishment of the slavery issue were front and center of curricula now in order to promote the rage and horror felt about black people so many years ago that virtually none of the students today can even trace a family member to. Strangely, I believed that there would be much more &#8216;emotional harm&rsquo; done {gag} to blacks if it was eliminated.</p>
<p>The goal, I thought, was to varnish all history that showed blacks  as victims, but discretely do away with all history that showed anything negative about them.<br>

		<p>A couple questions, as always hope not to offend:</p>
<p>Is it just me, or have these Ghetto lotteries been rather common as of late? Maybe some blacks are noticing this, and are taking their own home-made college courses to accomplish such a win. <br>
I personally agree with Wayne Engle, deep down they truly love hearing about slavery, and using it as the white races bottomless pit that will never have a bottom to fall on. </p>
<p>If the teacher or school is sued for explaining slavery&hellip;how come the people who made the movie &#8220;Roots&#8221; weren&rsquo;t sued by the entire nation of blacks in america?</p>
<p>And as for the name &#8220;Margaret Black school&#8221;, is the &#8220;black&#8221; simply the last name? Or is it actually a &#8220;Black&#8221; school?<br>

		<p>&#8220;What if it turns out the teacher reading the book is Black???&#8221;</p>
<p>No problem.  As long as they can find a school administrator who is white, who they can blame it on, they&rsquo;re good to go with their lawsuit.<br>
These days, America judges all people by the color of their skin, but only whites can be racists, and all whites are racists; it&rsquo;s just a matter of finding the &#8220;proof&#8221;, which can be anything at all, even if it&rsquo;s just a baseless, black accusation against white skin, since everyone knows that all whites are racists anyway and deserve whatever they get accordingly.<br>

		<p>I would like to know why the teacher was reading aloud to these students. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t these students read for themselves?</p>

		<p>To Anonymous (re post # 33):</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about blacks foaming at the mouth and blaming any Caucasian as racist for anything bad that happens. Here&rsquo;s a flesh and blood actual event, to back up my point:</p>
<p>During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, a bomb in a public park went off, as you know. A black woman and a Turkish man were killed.</p>
<p>The black woman&rsquo;s family raged not at the police chief, for lack of security - he was black. Not at the mayor - she was black.</p>
<p>Instead, they blamed the white head of the Atlanta Olympic Organizing Committee, Billy Payne, for the bombing.</p>
<p>From that point on, coupled with the silence that accompanies black on black killings, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that as long as Darcellus Washington is killed by Willie Kasavubu, instead of Paul Flaherty, Kim Lee Chun, or Jose Delgado; they&rsquo;ll NEVER change.  </p>

		<p>I hope they get that material out of the schools. You know the only reason for it is to inculcate hatred of whites in the minds of blacks, to keep alive the resentments of yesteryear. History is full of cruelties on a mass scale; most of it is glossed over except those that serve an agenda for today. Why do you think people like Bill Ayers wormed their way into the field of education? What&rsquo;s emphasized and what&rsquo;s not isn&rsquo;t just accidental but is done for a purpose. </p>

		<p>Chicagoan #36: This is why White people, especially parents, should run for, and get onto, the School Boards.</p>
<p>School Boards hire and fire Administrators and Faculty personnel. They also approve or disallow Text books, and other tools, used for teaching the children. </p>
<p>Yes, AmReners, School Boards are among the top places of where we need to be, to properly influence the education of our children, and aid in the instruction of traditional American values.</p>
