<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/global/22blond.html?_r=1">For Russia&rsquo;s Poor, Blond Hair Is Snippet of Gold</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Kramer, New York Times, November 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Long sought for wigs and toupees, human hair is now in particularly high demand for hair extension procedures in more affluent countries. Dark hair from India and China is more plentiful, but blond and other light shades are valued for their relative scarcity and because they are easier to dye to match almost any woman&rsquo;s natural color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Natalya N. Vinokurova, 26, grew up nearby in Yukhnov, a town where half the homes lack indoor plumbing and the average monthly wage is about $300. {snip}</p>
<p>But Ms. Vinokurova cultivated something with market value: strawberry blond hair that hung to her waist before she sold it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The best hair, he [Aleksei N. Kuznetsov, owner of Belli Capelli, a hair processing company] said, is honey-hued, changes color in the light and is soft to the touch.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In Belarus, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, a staunch nationalist, has placed such tight controls on small entrepreneurs that the trade is all but impossible, to the regret of those in the business, because the country is poor and has an abundance of blond women.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;and has an abundance of blond women&#8221;: At least for the time being. Belarus is another low birth rate (1.2) country that is headed for its own demographic problem. Hopefully, they will 1) maintain strict controls on immigration and 2) increase their (blonde) birth rate.  Sorry if that sounds racist. I&rsquo;m not blonde myself, but I have no desire to see blondes move any closer towards extinction.</p>

		<p>My beloved Russian-Ukrainian blond-haired wife has given me (a dark-blond, blue-eyed American) with the greatest gifts I could have ever hoped: two honey-blond, blue-eyed children.</p>

		<p>They should have titled this article &#8220;You never know how much you want it until you miss it so&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Particularly with the anti-white, anti-blonde, hate campaign that Hollyweird throws at us as a stereotype for the sex symbol (and the predictably resulting rush to darken the look of the &#8216;preferred&rsquo; hair color in film and culture), it saddens me that we are reduced to this level of grubbing after dead follicles.</p>
<p>I mean, if you love the look, no matter how much you demonize it, the obvious way to get lush, blonde, hair is _thru genetic science_.</p>
<p>There is no need or functional use (you are not pumping up the economy enough to make a difference) in this indulgence of such grotesquery.</p>
<p>One of the most overt and despicable acts of feminism is the _hateful_ look adopted by 3 of the 4 women shown in the article photo: the bobbed page boy appearance.  As if the act of selling a part of themselves is an evil deed which they have no control over.</p>
<p>I am no fetishist or at least I have so many of them when it comes to women that I can trade them around but a full head of hair, worn in tail or braid or even just shoulder length is so very pretty.</p>
<p>I can respect a cultural or personal choice to wear it shorter after birth or to simplify/render safe a working appearance but to just throw it away like meat is wrong.</p>
<p>I suppose it does show two things:</p>
<p>Siberia and the remote Urals that front it are what naturalists like Darwin would call natural &#8216;peripheral isolates&rsquo; for gene groups that otherwise face extinction.  Given the Aryans are most likely a proto-Nordic &#8216;Viking&rsquo; group that simply took the wrong river and wound up (extinct) in India, it gives an idea of how ancient this genetic legacy may really be that we risk throwing away.</p>
<p>And (in a sane world where civilization didn&rsquo;t bring &#8216;migration&rsquo; by unwanteds) boy could we ever do better than sending our money to Africa and West Asia.  300 dollars a month is pathetic, even for FSU Belarus.</p>

		<p>For God&rsquo;s sake Gavrick, don&rsquo;t stop at 2! That&rsquo;s just replacement. We need a population explosion in blond and/or blue-eyed people. Try for 7 kids like the US birth rate during the early republic. We need as many as we can get! Keep going! (Go for the gold [as it were].)</p>
