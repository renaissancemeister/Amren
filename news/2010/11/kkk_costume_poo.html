<h1>KKK Costume &#8216;Poor Judgment&rsquo; But Not a Crime: Police</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CTV (Scarborough, Ontario), November 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police do not intend to lay charges after two men in Campbellford, Ont. dressed up for a Halloween party as a member of the Ku Klux Klan and his black prisoner.</p>
<p>One of the men wore white robes and a cone-shaped headpiece, with a Confederate flag draped across his shoulders.</p>
<p>He was leading another man  &mdash;  who had full blackface makeup and was wearing a red and blue plaid shirt  &mdash;  around by a rope.</p>
<p>Const. Chris Dewsbury of the Northumberland OPP said police began to look into the situation after receiving a complaint following the Saturday night party at a Royal Canadian Legion.</p>
<p>He said an officer is still investigating but police don&rsquo;t expect to press charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the present time it would appear this was simply a case of poor judgment into the selection of a Halloween costume and there is no evidence to suggest a criminal offence has taken place,&#8221; Dewsbury told CTV.ca.</p>
<p>He said the people wearing the costume did not intend it as a racist gesture and added that wearing the costume does not constitute a hate crime. The pair won a prize for the costume.</p>
<p>Joy Herrington, president of the Campbellford Legion, issued an apology on Tuesday for the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;As president of Branch 103 Campbellford, of the Royal Canadian Legion, I humbly apologize to all those offended by the events that took place at our Halloween Party,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The events in no way reflect the views of the Royal Canadian Legion, or its members. Those responsible have been spoken to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark Andrade, who owns a restaurant in Campbellford, said he was disgusted by the costume and upset that the Legion allowed it  &mdash;  and even awarded a prize to the men.</p>
<p>Andrade, who is black, told the Canadian Press he has &#8220;never felt as alone&#8221; as he did at the party, and left immediately after he saw the costume.</p>
<p>Trent Hills Mayor Hector MacMillan called the incident &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; and &#8220;appalling,&#8221; and said it&rsquo;s not an accurate reflection of Campbellford, a small town north of Brighton, Ont.<br>

		<p>I agree- the costume was offensive- especially the Confederate flag which was not used by the 3K until the 1980&rsquo;s. While I agree that Blacks are about the easiest people to offend this costume is really over the top!</p>

<p>Notice the story didn&rsquo;t contain quotes from anyone who thought it was no big deal, or even who thought the big stink raised over this silly thing is what was really offensive. </p>
<p>The Canadians have learned well from the American liberal MSM.</p>

I notice this all the time. Stories like this will often point out how &#8220;disgusted&#8221; or &#8220;sickened&#8221; the local community is by a racial incident. I find it hard to believe that the average white person is as filled   &mdash;   utterly filled   &mdash;   with indignation over racism as the media would have us believe.</p>

		<p>Anyone who would wear &#8220;costumes&#8221; like this was either just looking to provoke, for trouble, attention&hellip;or all of the above. No otherwise sane person in the western world of today would think that a good idea - I smell a rat.  </p>

		<p>If this Jamaican doesn&rsquo;t like it, then leave. Meanwhile Jamaicans here in Toronto are engaging in a war of terror and crime on law-abiding Canadians.</p>

		<p>Halloween costumes often portray evil, in the form of devils, witches, goblins, famous murderers, etc.  This holiday is one in which people are supposed to be made to feel frightened or creeped out, not comfortable.</p>

<p><i>Andrade, who is black, told the Canadian Press he has &ldquo;never felt as alone&rdquo; as he did at the party, and left immediately after he saw the costume.</i></p>
<p><br>
He felt alone? Seeing the costume made him feel lonely? It made him leave the party early? Good Lord! The indignities this young Afro-Canadian has suffered are horrible beyond imagining! Because we all know that NO white person has EVER been made to feel lonely in a crowd; or EVER been so upset that had a leave a party early! </p>
<p>So now that the definition of &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; has been expanded   &mdash;   by the Canadian &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; Tribunals, among many others   &mdash;   to include the (non-existent, completely imaginary) &#8220;Right Not To Be Offended,&#8221; it seems we are now also to worry about the &#8220;Right Not To Feel Lonely.&#8221; Not feeling lonely is now, apparently, a &#8220;Human Right.&#8221; Expect the UN to add it to their list of &#8220;Human Rights Violations&#8221; real soon. </p>
<p>So mind your manners, everybody! Don&rsquo;t be doing anything that might leave black people feeling lonely! Don&rsquo;t cause any minority person, anywhere, anytime, anytime, to feel left out. Because if you do, your local &#8220;police [will] look into the situation after receiving a complaint.&#8221; </p>
<p>I would suggest that if the extraordinarily sensitive and easily offended Mr. Andrade is feeling all lonely-like being a black man in small-town Canada, he would more enjoy being surrounded by his own kind, back in whatever part of the Caribbean or Africa that he and his people emigrated from. </p>

		<p>#8   &mdash;   Yes, I agree that any ethnic not feeling comfortable living with whites could easily remove themselves and relocate to a locale where the majority look like themselves. However, Andrade would no longer be in a position to cry out in pain as the &#8220;victim&#8221; here. Incidentally, his photo reflects that he is about one-quarter black, so I don&rsquo;t know what his problem is   &mdash;   except to relish in all that delicious sympathy when surrounded by guilt-ridden white Canadians. </p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m usually curious as to how many &#8220;Blacks&#8221; are in any given area, I checked out these <a href="http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3514004&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Brighton&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=35&amp;B1=Custom&amp;Custom=28000" rel="nofollow">Stats Canada figures</a> to find a total of (20) twenty Blacks out of a total of 9,605 residents. </p>
<p>So these twenty blacks may be comprised of 2 or 3 black families, who surely belong to recent Caribbean immigrants, because like most of Ontario (except Toronto)   &mdash;   had zero Blacks until mass 3rd world immigration was foisted upon us. </p>

		<p>Would it be correct to assume one could claim the being offended and the chill of loneliness had some insensitive person in a burqa costume been in attendance?  Like the white outfits of the K3 burqas covers head-to-toe, are purpose built for for anonymity, and have a horrific history of murder and mayhem.  Far more people have been killed by folks in burqas than those in K3 sheets.  Just curious.</p>
