			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, Muslim Public Affairs Council, November 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week, MPAC [Muslim Public Affairs Council] completed a quarterly training for Transportation Security Officers (TSO) with about 2,200 officers receiving training on cultural awareness about Islam and Muslims. This was an important achievement for MPAC and the Muslim American community in light of the recent airport security changes and because TSOs are responsible for screening passengers and luggage.</p>
<p>MPAC President Salam Al-Marayati, MPAC Civic Outreach Coordinator, Saadia Khan and MPAC volunteers, Nisreen Malhis and Sireen Sawaf, conducted the trainings at Los Angeles International Airport for the past two months. They discussed the diversity of Muslims around the world from cultural dress to language to tenets. The four trainers taught the TSOs how to properly handle a Quran and discussed the different ways Muslim women and men choose to cover or dress. For example, the TSOs learned if a woman wears hijab and needs a secondary screening she should be screened in a private area by a female TSO officer.</p>
<p>The training sessions allowed trainers to discuss the common practice of Muslims praying in various areas of the airport, adding that they do this because LAX does not have a designated prayer area as other airports do.</p>
<p>The officers were extremely receptive and interested in the information presented. They had many questions regarding the meaning of jihad, sharia, and the rights of women in Muslim countries.</p>
<p>LAX is the third largest airport in the world, making it important for Transportation Security Administration to conduct cultural awareness trainings in order for officers to effectively and efficiently keep the airports secure rather than deciphering cultural tenets. MPAC commends LAX for taking the initiative to implement these trainings.</p>
<p>Earlier this year at the last quarterly training, the TSA invited asked Nirinjan Khalsa of the Human Relations Commission to highlight the Sikh religion.</p>

		<p>Have any of the Arab countries instituted &#8220;cultural awareness training&#8221; to prepare them for the customs of American air travelers?  No, it&rsquo;s only our TSA thugs who feel the need to be &#8220;sensitive&#8221; to anyone who isn&rsquo;t White.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for our arrogant Airport NKVD to reach end-of-life.  I thank God that I&rsquo;m retired now, and no longer have to travel by air.<br>

		<p>This is a press release so most of it is hype and propaganda. </p>
<p>The kicker is that many of these TSA &#8220;officers&#8221; who sat for the training are black, affirmative-action-type hires. Sadly, they are as dumb as a bag of rocks and have limited retention skills. The lying Muslims, therefore, are trying to teach sensitivity to the unteachable. I suppose the joke is on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until TSA Officer Shaniqua gropes Abdullah, curses out Fayeed, or throws Mohammad&rsquo;s Koran in the trash bin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rest of us miss our flights. </p>
<p>What happened to America?</p>

<p>And how do these screeners touching small children as they do get away with it? Security or no security, that is or is not child molestation? Causing psychological damage for no real reason unless warranted?</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re catering to the very group of people who are blowing up things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all having our rights compromised, because of the Muslim jihadists and their willing accomplices in the Muslim community at large, because the federal Gestapo REFUSES to profile and search the ones most likely to kill people, which, of course, are Muslims.</p>
<p>I would venture to say not one single white American or child that has been screened poses a threat to blowing up an airplane, yet the fed sees fit to search them anyway going so far as to employ 67,000 gropers to do the useless, unnecessary work.</p>
<p>Take note:  Not one single person has been apprehended as a legitimate threat of bringing down aircraft out of literally millions who have been groped and scanned.</p>
<p>Along with unnecessary foreign wars, this situation is another classic sign of an empire in decline.</p>
<p>How long do we have before we begin our implosion?</p>

		<p>In muslim countries, muslim women in hijab and abayaa do not get searched as we do and the muslims do not do pat downs on anyone they do not even search much for weapons and I have been let into the passenger boarding area with a large knife. As long as the muslim countries pay their tithings to the terrorists, all will be well in muzzie land.</p>

Yep, retired is good, I used to travel 3 weeks of every month.  I am afraid if I was traveling now I would have decked one of these idiots by now.  No one will touch me, my wife or daughter in that manner.  A few years in Uncle Sam&rsquo;s dust ups taught me one thing, a man doesn&rsquo;t go to war and return to become a squeeking mouse.</p>

		<p>Not very off the topic, but the alternative to the grope is the flouroscopy machine.  Flouroscopy is a real time x-ray.  There is a legal mess going on somewhere there.  AMA Guidelines - the law when using flouroscopic exam say that ALL flouroscopic exams must be recorded.  Getting around this item may have been done, but if it hasn&rsquo;t, then TSO and their employers, the Government bureaucracy, etc., is in violation of the law when using flouroscopic equipment.  If they ARE making that required recording, then another legal problem arises concerning the record produced because privacy law enters in.  In the health care world, HIPAA is very specific about how those records are used, shared, transported (internet sharing), and stored.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help wondering if they sorted all that out before they started doing those scans?</p>

<p>The terrorist win another round, since they are taking part in the training the people who will do airport security.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had many questions regarding the meaning of jihad, sharia, and the rights of women in Muslim countries. &#8220;</p>
<p>What does that have to do with security at the airports? <br>

		<p>White Americans are dumb as rocks. </p>
<p>We have put up with the invasion of the black/brown hoardes,  given them everything under the sky, (all in the name of &#8220;tolerance&#8221;) now we are allowing even more of our enemies to &#8220;search&#8221; us in a disgusting, illegal way????? </p>
<p>When are Whites ever going to wake up and see what is being done to them and their own nations the world over?  It looks to me like they will never wake up. They go along to get along and that is their downfall.</p>

		<p>What they SHOULD be teaching TSA officers is how to spot a muslim terrorist and give HIM the invasive treatment that they&rsquo;re now doling out to everybody. Rather than strip-searching children and harassing grandmothers, they could do something useful that way. Of course, the PC Police will never stand for something that targets the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; specifically.</p>

		<p>If you want special treatment at the screeners, just be sure to show you are a very religious person.  Amish, Jews, Muslims, Catholic Nuns, Buddhist priests - all have modesty issues.  We should copy that and REALLY SLOW DOWN this ludicrous and invasive process.</p>

		<p>They were &#8220;extremely interested and receptive&#8221;? Yeah, sure they were. Just another propaganda piece extolling the virtuous TSA employees. From what I&rsquo;ve seen most of them haven&rsquo;t read a book since they got out of high school, let alone being rapt students of cultural nuances.</p>

		<p>Black Obango #1: Yes, you are quite lucky not to have to travel,especially by the Airlines. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad, but the Airlines were one of the jewels of American Industry, and of adventure. I used to love to fly, but I haven&rsquo;t been on a plane in over 15 years. Of course, with all of this Police State nonsense, I will never fly again. </p>
<p>Which brings me to several videos I have received from friends in the past few days. These videos are from Brasscheck TV.com. </p>
<p>All AmRen readers must make time to watch these videos produced by Brasscheck TV. Visit www.brasschecktv.com and prepare to be outraged by the way American Citizens, from our infants, to our Senior Citizens, are treated by the TSA. </p>
