<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=226025">My Racist Bake Sale</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Stossel, WorldNetDaily, November 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This week, I held a bake sale  &mdash;  a racist bake sale. I stood in midtown Manhattan shouting, &#8220;Cupcakes for sale.&#8221; My price list read:</p>
<p>Asians  &mdash;  $1.50<br>
Whites  &mdash;  $1.00<br>
Blacks/Latinos  &mdash;  50 cents</p>
<p>People stared. One yelled, &#8220;What is funny to you about people who are less privileged?&#8221; A black woman said, angrily, &#8220;It&rsquo;s very offensive, very demeaning!&#8221; One black man accused me of poisoning the cupcakes.</p>
<p>I understand why people got angry. What I did was hurtful to some. My bake sale mimicked what some conservative college students did at Bucknell University. The students wanted to satirize their school&rsquo;s affirmative-action policy, which makes it easier for blacks and Hispanics to get admitted.</p>
<p>I think affirmative action is racism  &mdash;  and therefore wrong. If a private school like Bucknell wants to have such policies to increase diversity, fine. But government-imposed affirmative action is offensive. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All the Bucknell students wanted was a campus discussion about that. Why not? A university is supposed to be a place for open discussion, but some topics are apparently off-limits. {snip}</p>
<p>About an hour after the students began their &#8220;affirmative-action&#8221; sale, the associate dean of students shut it down. He said it was because the prices charged were different from those listed on the permissions application. An offer to change the prices was rejected. Then the club&rsquo;s application to hold another sale was rejected. Ironically, the associate dean said it would violate the schools nondiscrimination policy! He would authorize a debate on affirmative action, but nothing else.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} My affirmative-action cupcake &#8220;event&#8221; led to some interesting discussions. One young woman began by criticizing me, &#8220;It&rsquo;s absolutely wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>But after I raised the parallel with college admissions, she said: &#8220;No race of people is worth more than another. Or less.&#8221;</p>
<p>But do you believe in affirmative action in colleges? I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>Those are the kind discussions students should have.</p>

<p>We know better than the &#8220;color-blind&#8221; nonsense.  Blacks don&rsquo;t ask for color-blinded anything. They want to use their unearned Diversity Privilege to surround White Humanity, force us to undergo Multicultural Understanding treatments, demand we epress racial guilt when we should be declaring racial pride, and tear down our natural defenses by making us feel like we have a mental disease if we don&rsquo;t want to be surrounded by blacks.</p>
<p>Whenever a campus controversy breaks out, look for the quotations from the &#8220;distinguished, esteemed, renowned&#8221; academic blacks that essentially say &#8220;It&rsquo;s because of our lack of Diversity that such bigoted and racist prejudices flourish here on campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks are taught they can punish White Humanity for racism by preventing us from having anything that is just ours, such as society, culture, heroes, etc.</p>
<p>Blacks want to push themselves into all our affairs, and they justify it by saying they are encouraging Diversity to prevent racism.</p>
<p>We know the truth: Through their unearned Diversity Privileges and mandates, they are promoted into positions of power and authority and thus become attractive to White Girls, and then they can get their hands on what should only be ours: White Wombs.</p>
<p>Read White Flight by Kruse.  The case is made that White Segregationists were able to thrive because their communities were too homogeneous.  Interpret the inverse:   Appreciation for Diversity and Integration thrives where we find Diversity. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the BIG LIE.  </p>
<p>Whites who are subjected to Diversity want to get away from it and all the curses that come with it.  Except for the Whites at the top- the Presidents and CEOs who keep their jobs and huge paychecks no matter how many Whites are oppressed and marginalized underneath them. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard Stossel on the O&rsquo;Reilley Factor before.  He&rsquo;s a race-blind libertarian, but I must say the guy has cajones for doing this.  When I saw it on television I thought, &#8220;Finally, someone is attacking affirmative action.  Everyone&rsquo;s so focused on &#8216;the economy&rsquo; they seem to have forgotten the real issues we face.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you can tell from the article (&#8220;I think affirmative action is racism &mdash; and therefore wrong.&#8221;) that he&rsquo;s really only useful as an attacker of big government and things like affirmative action - on most issues he&rsquo;s on the enemy&rsquo;s side.</p>

		<p>Those who oppose the racist bake sale may have a point. . and most likely it will be shut down and possibly even be used as an example of &#8216;hate&rsquo; and even used as a rationale for more affirmative action. . however is interesting that this is &#8216;offensive&rsquo; and &#8216;absolutely wrong&rsquo; while the affirmative action itself (which the bake sale is supposedly highlighting) is never seriously called into question. </p>

		<p>Obviously there are some groups out who want to have their cake and eat it too!</p>
<p>They want AA but don&rsquo;t want it discussed just in case it is seen for the obnoxious, unfair and totally racist concept that it really is.</p>
<p>The cake sale was a very good illustration of the absurdity of it all, both AA and the PC (non) debate.</p>

		<p>John Stossel is too smart to be a racial equalitarian.  He is also smart enough to realize that his positive impact on our society would be reduced to near zero if he unabashedly came out with the truth.  So let us applaud him for doing what he can and for saying what he can to improve our situation.  Kudos to him!</p>

		<p>We had affirmative action cake sales at aSouth-African universatie with great effect a few years back(I still have the photos), with one difference though. CAKES FOR SALE!!. for Whites R5, for Coloreds R2, for Blacks R1, ANC members free if they can show a members card and put some money into the CORRUPTION BOX. We had a little donations box, but I am sure you can use your local Liberal/Labour/Socialist party instead. </p>

		<p>How about a &#8220;Racist Admissions Policy&#8221; for Bucknell:</p>
<p>Asians - must score in the upper 1% of their  H.S. graduating class and a composite 1750 on the SAT</p>
<p>Caucasians - must score in the upper 1% of their H.S. graduating class and a composite<br>
1700 on the SAT</p>
<p>Hispanics and Bantus - must count to 10 on your fingers </p>

		<p>A parallel story would be to sell cupcakes by quota.  If you have 100 cupcakes you sell 12 or more to blacks 16 or more to Hispanics and 72 or less to whites.  This is important to make up for historical discrimination. </p>

<p>Well, gosh and goll-ee. My bible says, </p>
<p>&#8216;You alone of all the families of the earth have I known.&rsquo;<br>
and<br>
&#8216;Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jesus even said, &#8216;You did not choose me, but I chose you.&rsquo;<br>
and <br>
St. Paul noted, &#8216;As he hath PREDESTINED us to the adoption as SONS,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>As one commentator has noted, &#8216;God is a choosing God.&rsquo;<br>
Which means universalism is a demonic philosophy, to be blunt.</p>

<p>I agree. BTW the word is &#8220;cojones&#8221;. &#8220;Cajones are drawers or in some cases boxes&#8221; What a difference a vowel makes.</p>

		<p>If I tried this at my school I would be thrown out under the very same policies they use to justify the black students association. (Which I am tempted to join just for the hell of it, no that I expect they would deny me   &mdash;   but it would be humorous if they do.</p>
<p>Of course, starting a white students association would be racist, and a thorn in their side.   </p>

		<p>Why is this news? Affirmative action bake sales have been around college campuses at least since 2003 when the Supreme Court said that universities could use race as a factor in admissions [Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger].</p>
