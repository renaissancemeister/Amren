<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>JULIA GILLARD&rsquo;s election pitch to avoid a &#8220;big Australia&#8221; is to be abandoned after a Treasury warning that strong future immigration is &#8220;probably inescapable&#8221;.</p>
<p>In another policy retreat, the government&rsquo;s population review has been delayed and &#8220;recalibrated&#8221; to focus on skills shortages and regional growth, rather than nominating population targets.</p>
<p>During the election campaign in August, Ms Gillard said Australia should not &#8220;hurtle&#8221; towards a big population. At the time, she said a Treasury projection that Australia would have a population of 36 million people by 2050 was excessive. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t support the idea of a big Australia with arbitrary targets of, say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a 36 million-strong Australia,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>However, a Treasury briefing sent to Ms Gillard after the campaign suggests she could have no choice. The briefing warns that the prediction of 36 million people &#8220;factors in a significant reduction&#8221; in migration, from a recent peak of 300,000 to an annual average of 180,000.</p>
<p>It concludes that even if annual net migration was lowered to an unrealistically low 60,000 per annum, Australia&rsquo;s population would still reach 29 million by 2050.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the powerful global forces driving the Australian economy, net immigration figures well in excess of that low number are probably inescapable,&#8221; the briefing says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong population growth is not necessarily unsustainable. It need not adversely affect the environment, the liveability of cities, infrastructure and service delivery, provided the right plans and policies are put in place now in anticipation of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A senior Labor source said business groups had been pressuring the government to adopt a default position &#8220;where the issue of specific targets is not addressed&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the government has accepted the reality that it is not prepared to cut migration to the extent needed to significantly reduce population growth,&#8221; the source said.</p>
<p>Population Minister Tony Burke has indicated the government might miss an April 2011 deadline for its population review, blaming the extended caretaker period while a new government was being formed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to give a commitment that we&rsquo;ll be able to get to that [April] time frame,&#8221; Mr Burke said.</p>
<p>Days before the election was called in July, Mr Burke appointed three population panels to provide advice on demographic change and liveability, productivity and prosperity, and sustainable development.</p>
<p>Treasury&rsquo;s budget update released last week predicted that unemployment will fall to 4.5 per cent by June 2011, heightening concerns that skills shortages could re-emerge as a key issue.</p>
<p>Asked if it was prudent to be talking about immigration cuts at such a time, Treasurer Wayne Swan said the government had refocused the migration program on skills.</p>

		<p>Question 1, Why do most immigrants from the 3rd world? Why is so difficult for English speaking migrants to be able to come here.</p>
<p>Question 2. Outside the main capital cities, namely, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane &amp; Perth, unemployment and particulary youth unemployment is VERY high. The 4 cities I have mentioned seem to be in some sort of perpetual boom, there are plenty of jobs but housing is unaffordable. Sydney in particular is busrting at the seams and has had to resort to desalinated water. All Australian cities have severe water shortage problems. Most migrants flock to the cities often living in ghetto like conditions in poorer suburbs. MORE MIGRANTS NEEDED???</p>
<p>Question 3, Why won&rsquo;t the politicians listen to the peoples concerns about present migration policies and subsequent social problems?</p>

		<p>So having secured re-election (just) with a promise to reduce immigration Labor has done what mainstream parties always do, and betrayed those who voted for it. The only comfort to be drawn from this is that forty years is a very long time in politics and everything may yet change in unpredictable ways - what effect, for example, might Europe&rsquo;s move to the nationalist right, if sustained, have on an Australian public opinion which has never been too fond of (non-white) immigration? </p>
<p>Notice the role of big business in pressing for the maximisation of immigration. It&rsquo;s worth bearing in mind the words of Sir Charles Dilke when writing about Australia in his book &#8220;Greater Britain&#8221; (1866) &#8220;&hellip;unrestricted immigration may destroy the literature, the traditions, the nationality itself of the invaded country, and it is a question whether those ideas are not worth preserving even at the cost of a few figures in the return of imports, exports and population. A country in which free trade principles have been carried to their utmost logical development must be cosmopolitan and nationless&hellip;many, even those who respect and admire the Chinese, are in favour of a tax upon the yellow immigration. They fear that otherwise they may see the English element swamped in the Asiatic throughout Australia. It is not certain that we may not some day have to encounter a similar danger in old England.</p>

		<p>This is why I get annoyed when I read comments on various news sites etc based in the UK or Europe along the lines of &#8220;We need an immigration system like that of Australia&#8221; (often Canada is mentioned too). Supposedly, the comments usually go on to read, we pick and choose and only the highest skilled make the cut (yeah right). Our system is just as broken, we just didn&rsquo;t let it deteriorate as badly, as quickly. But the situation now is just about as dire. </p>

<p>  The Australian public has about as much control over immigration as we do here in the United States. The controlled media, dishonest privileged elites, and multinational corporations effectively control the government. The average person is against the racial transformation of Australia, but they&rsquo;re up against the same fanatical, greedy, Neo-Marxist  forces we are here in America.</p>

<p>Increased profits for industrialists and businessmen cannot make up for cultural, social, ecological, and economic destruction caused by massive importation of Third World poverty, crime, and never-ending racial, religious, and ethnic conflicts.

At what point do we realize democracy isn&rsquo;t working anymore.  Maybe it needs extreme modifcations before its too late - for example, if a politician does not do a, b, and c he is impeached by default- of course, even if we did do this they would find a way out - like bloomberg and the ny city council which got around twice voter approved term limits. </p>

<p>The business sector in Australia has been complaining about a so-called lack of skilled labour for very many years. This allows them to argue the immigration laws should be relaxed which allows more immigrants which increases labour supply which puts downward pressure on wages. Simple.</p>
<p>Business wants bigger populations because that means more customers and more revenue. Simple.</p>
<p>Never listen to business on these sorts of issues.</p>

		<p>Well, unless everything that is said about oil running out is -also- a lie, we must face a given: distributionist capitalism, which seeks to maximize profit by charging a penny per back for every step in an &#8216;owned process&rsquo; (how to make Nike shoes for instance) is thermodynamically unsustainable.</p>
<p>It is vastly more effective to bring all resources necessary for product or service X _together_ and then execute the manufacturing process in-situ than it is to dig it up here, refine there, stamp/smelt/cast/coat it over there, and then package and send it on for distribution and customer delivery in X nation.  Probably from a different port and longshoreman&rsquo;s position than brought it in.</p>
<p>That &#8216;diversification&rsquo; of labor elements, makes all of them poorer because EACH has to be paid while controlling the overall retail value of the good.  In this, since virtually everything is controlled by monopolistic corporations, what is rewarded in pennies is penalized back in purchased goods.  It is also how a _very few_ buid wealth.  By taking from both ends (each step in the manufacturing process becomes the final &#8216;built in value&rsquo; reward in the retail one) against the middle.</p>
<p>In this, mercantile interests are playing a losing game by trying to cut back labor to ever lower levels of reward driven social empowerment.</p>
<p>OTOH, if robots are introduced to the system, the entire system falls apart.  Because no matter how many thermodynamically improbable &#8216;locations as steps&rsquo; you add to the system, the robots doing the work are non-functional social interactants and thus deserve -nothing- as for their efforts in rendering the service or product.  If it doesn&rsquo;t -cost anything- for said product to be produced, then the elite cannot, morally, charge his customer base for simple passage of materials through his owned process.</p>
<p>Of course you can still have a functional market system but ONLY by giving the benefits of X# of robots to individuals as purchasing power.</p>
<p>This is also the point where, by OWNING robots, someone can get even the cheapest level of labor rewards (say 2-5,000 dollars a year, locally, which is what this nation is headed for) to work in their favor.</p>
<p>Because they are controlling not a patented and capitalized process (thermodynamics: energy in) but the work product (number of goods made for a given &#8216;reward group&rsquo; population).  They are the ones becoming elites.</p>
<p>And elites fear this realization, terribly.  It is why they alternately demonize (&#8216;Terminator&rsquo;) and angelicize (&#8216;AI&rsquo;) robotics so that the actual technology base level for their development is stuck just north of 1950s Disney animatronics.</p>
<p>For race realists, there is another consideration: robotics, by ironically replacing the nominal &#8216;work ethic&rsquo; through socialist processes (a literal proletariat) _enable nationalism_ as a function of ethnic identity.  Based on more subjective understandings of morality, beauty, intellect and group identity.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all a big lie.  You cannot support an infinite population anywhere.  Most the availible farmland in Autralia is probably taken up already, so of course any new immigrants will be moving into the cities, which are already huge sprawling masses, that probably can&rsquo;t be supported with the natural resources Australia has.  And besides, she forgot to mention how immigration will adversely affect the CULTURE of Australia.  Its funny, she cares about the purity of the environment, but not the purity of the people.  To me, they are interconnected, one in the same.  You can not care about one, and not care about the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not certain that we may not some day have to encounter a similar danger in old England.&#8221;</p>
<p>My God, I can&rsquo;t believe a man predicted the swamping of England by immigrants all the way back in 1866!</p>

<p>*Greed and cheap labour will be the death of the White race.*</p>
<p>&#8220;Greed has *always* been the undoing of the White race. These same greedy Whites that want cheap labor non-White immigration are no different than the Whites that thought it was a good idea to use cheap labor Africans to work the plantations in the New World. How did that ultimately work out for Whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>Greed is a common factor in every human group.  If anything, whites have succeeded the most at conquering the basic emotion of greed, through an inially Greek inspired idea of altruism, which was picked up by most of Europe.  Even the very old story cycle that Wagner used in his opera, &#8220;The Ring of the Nibelung,&#8221; represents perhaps one of the earliest morality plays regarding greed and the betrayals of trust and culture that it causes.  Wagner used it, as the early Christian revisionists did to foretell the death of the &#8220;Old Gods&#8221; and indigenous religions of Europe, where ideas like usury were already established, and business was done on a hankshake and promise because in the Asatric view, a promise was an oath, and if you broke your word, you would never enter Vahalla, but remain outside in Limbo.  This is why immigrants from Nordic countries and England, always ran the most stable banks and business up until recently.  But business has been corrupted by Diversity, forced inclusion of people from cultures that did not have this ancient maxim embedded genetically.  Ironically, these cultural tendancies combined with Christianity to produce the most stable of all European nations, until they were overtaken by the EU with its asyllum laws and quotas, and not a little Christian infused guilt syndrome.  But the historical political mission of The Church is well understood today.  Christianity used the notion of altruism to assist in its world mission of conversion, even when it was done through barbarity exceeding even ancient Rome.  Behind it was always a state that wanted more power and wealth, allied with The Church that also wanted more power.  </p>
<p>Today, we are seeing how greed works in the East;  A Russian Mafia that will sell its own children into slavery, a China that will compromise its once puritanical interpretation of communism, ignoring international business standards because it can, quality assurance because it can, etc.  No, neither the West nor the white race has any monopoly on greed.</p>
<p>What we need is a vision of a culture that could evolve beyond this.  As in the Boer example, or even the American pioneering era, selflessness is necessary for group survival.  Selflessness, not in the usual Christian sense where one is supposed to sell all their worldly goods and donate it to the poor, or better still (as far as it was concerned), The Church, but a recognition that the &#8220;rat race&#8221; mentality that came into being in the &rsquo;50s and 60s, that pitted one individual against another, has combined with Christian altruism, used to manipulate susceptible minds in a Christian culture to create a system that has been usurped and turned against us.  Just as dumb youths who thought, &#8220;If a little dope feels good, more must be better,&#8221; usurping politicians acted like dumb youths as in, &#8220;If a little immigration is good, a lot is better.&#8221;  No greater cynism was ever excercised in office when Catholic Edward Kennedy sponsored the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965.  Regardless of his and other liberal assurances, they KNEW immigrants would likely become automatic Democrats.  Most have long been admitted into State and Federal management positions, via AA, and so now we have bureaucracies that are not likely to chamge in function regardless of the laws that might be passed.  Our government has been turned against us.  Some of us feel the effect every day.  I certainly do.</p>
<p>So the greatest issue for Dems today is passing &#8220;The Dream Act&#8221; before 2012 because it will guarantee 12 million (or so) Dem votes.  They don&rsquo;t care how many neighborhoods turn into gang infested ghettos or how many American citizens will be harmed, or killed, they want to be sure that they remain in office, with all its priveliges and perks.  At this point, any white that votes Democratic is cutting their own throat, as well as murdering their own children.</p>
