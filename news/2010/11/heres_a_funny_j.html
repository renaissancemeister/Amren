			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Henderson, Living in a Madhouse, Nov. 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Here&rsquo;s a funny joke about stoning. In the Life of Brian Terry Jones (who plays Brian&rsquo;s mother) and Graham Chapman  (who plays Brian) go to a stoning.  At the site of the stoning there is a wayside vendor selling stones to throw at the person to be killed. Terry Jones goes up to the vendor and says &#8220;Two large rocks and a packet of gravel, please&#8221;.  (Think about it). The scene proceeds with John Cleese (who is in charge of the stoning) getting ever angrier as the would-be stoners keep missing  until he orders a gigantic masonry block to be dropped on the person being stoned.</p>
<p>On 11 November 2010 a Birmingham Tory  councillor  Gareth Compton ventured a joke about stoning.  Having heard the journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown pouring out her usual poison against Britain on the BBC R5 9.00 am phone-in programme  &mdash;  she placed Britain and the West in general  on a moral par with the likes of Iran and China when it comes  to human rights by saying  they had no right to lecture countries such as Iran and China because of the West&rsquo;s  own breaches of such rights  &mdash;  Mr Compton used twitter to share this with the world:  &#8220;Can someone please stone Yasmin Alibhai-Brown? I shan&rsquo;t tell Amnesty if you don&rsquo;t.  It would be a blessing, really.&#8221;  Not a very good joke I must admit, although I suspect that a sizeable number of Britons suddenly conjured up a pleasant fantasy of a world untroubled by the ubiquitous public utterings of the woman.</p>
<p>Ms Brown-Alibi, as a I cannot help myself thinking of her because of her incessant excuses for all the ethnic mayhem to which we are treated these days, then decided her life was in danger and made a complaint to the police alleging that it was not only an incitement to kill her but a racially incited one, something guaranteed to get the modern British policeman decidedly over excited.   She need not have bothered because Her Majesty&rsquo;s Finest were already on the case for someone else had complained.  Mr Compton was then arrested for having breached the Communications Act, doubtless had his DNA and fingerprints taken, before being bailed.</p>
<p>To any normal person, which of course excludes Ms  Brown-Alibi, Mr Compton&rsquo;s tweet would be seen for what it was, a joke. Brown-Alibi was morally equating Britain with Iran, a state which uses stoning, a comparison  which even after 13 years of NuLabour &#8216;s depredations on civil liberties will strike most as a trifle strong.  Mr Compton clearly made a joke which suggested  that Ms Brown-Alibi might care to experience the tender mercies of such a state.</p>
<p>Mr Compton&rsquo;s case is both sinister and absurd, but it is simply a high profile example of what has become a common occurrence in Britain: the use of the police to intimidate anyone who breaches the narrow range of  opinion allowed by political correctness.  Frequently  no charges are brought,  quite often because the police are acting without legal authority because no crime has been committed,  but the desired effect on the general public is achieved by creating an atmosphere of fear that nothing is safe to say if it is deemed to be politically incorrect.  Worse, like all totalitarian ideologies, political correctness is constantly expanding its remit so no one can ever be certain  that what was accepted yesterday is still permissible today.</p>
<p>I dare say there will be readers who cavil at the idea that political correctness is a totalitarian ideology. Let them consider this:  the ideology intrudes into every aspect of life because the discrimination mania can be applied to anything; the ideology claims there is only one permissible view, that of the ideology and those who do not subscribe to the ideology leave themselves open to punishment both by the law and  non-legal punishments such as media harassment and the loss of employment. </p>

<p>Milton had the answer to censors: &#8221;          &#8216;And though all the winds of doctrine were let loose upon the     earth,  so truth be in the field [and] we do  injuriously  by  licensing and prohibiting is to doubt her strength.  Let  her  and falsehood grapple;  who ever knew truth put to the worse,  in a free and open encounter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rsquo; [Milton  &mdash;  Areogapitica]. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that in the 21st century, we have speech that is outlawed in parts of the West. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful to our founding fathers in the U.S. to have put Freedom of Speech in writing. </p>
<p>An excellent article. I hope more journalists in the U.K. speak up on the soft-totalitarian police state in which they live. </p>
<p>And yes, I had to go look up &#8220;cavil&#8221; too. </p>

		<p>The problem is not political correctness itself. The problem is it&rsquo;s used to herd up and condemn and demonize whites and only whites. In America, you can&rsquo;t say the &#8216;N&rsquo; word, not even on AmRen but it&rsquo;s considered a sign or intellect to call someone it&rsquo;s corollary, &#8216;redneck&rsquo;. Political correctness needs to be applied to persons of color, not only because that&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s really committing most hate crimes but all so in the spirit of affirmative action. To make up for the previous and one sided misuse of anti-white political correctness and bigotry. </p>

		<p>For Living in a Madhouse to quote Milton is, especially, apt since it is he who coined the word &#8220;pandemonium&#8221; to describe the foremost city in Hell.</p>
<p>(When posting about regional variations in speech, &#8220;dialect&#8221; should be used to describe peculiarities of grammar, word stock or pronunciation; &#8220;accent&#8221; merely to mark the natural emphasis of certain syllables.  I have stewed about this for a week.  I become the pedant that ere I derided.)</p>

		<p>I am shocked he is not in jail.  The 6 or so guys who filmed themselves burning a Koran are.  Look up the Heretical 2 if you want an incredible story of NuBritain and speech prosecution.  About 5 years for a US based web site deemed offensive.  The media has buried the story of course.</p>

		<p>If Britain and the West are really that bad when it come to human rights, then surely we then have a moral obligation to keep asylum seekers out and deport all non-Whites for their own protection (including the awful Alibhai-Brown).</p>
<p>Otherwise it&rsquo;s comparable to importing Jews into Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>  I think this is a major reason so many intelligent and disillusioned whites want to leave Great Britain. It is certainly a reason why Pauline Hanson choose not to return. The problem is all white European societies seem infected with the gruesome cult of political correctness to a lesser or greater extent. It is our privileged elites and controlled media that promote and encourage the dreadful cult. </p>

 <br>
Needless to say, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown did not explain what these &#8220;breaches&#8221; are.  Compared with the Tienanmen Square Massacre and horrors like this</p>

		<p>This case is a symptom of the humorless, determined Left, that supports the wildest accusations against their political enemies.  It really does remind me of Stalin, or Mao, or any totalitarian regime, including Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>But if I may, the comic/satire film&rsquo;s event related in this article is not accurate.  First, it is helpful to understand that in the set up, women were not allowed at stonings.  Brian&rsquo;s mother drags him to a stoning where only women, disguised as men (rented beards and all) keep jumping the gun, while Jewish bureaucrat John Cleese keeps regailing them to &#8220;wait for it,&#8221; in traditional, and comical British Military style, while reads the list of charges, chief of which is uttering the name, &#8220;Jehova&#8221; at the dinner table.  The women pick up a large block of masonry and drop it on HIM, not the victim of the stoning. This, and a few other scenes are digs at the then rising &#8220;Feminazi&#8221; form of feminism. </p>
<p>I recommend this satire to all Amren readers and posters, especially John PM (my esteemed counterpart), as it brings up many philosophical questions about belief in any deliverer, and the liklihood of human fiction writing interferring.  They do this in a most comical, if not silly way, such as when Jesus cures a beggar of his lameness, but ruins his career as a beggar.  &#8220;Bloody do gooder,&#8221; the jobless man says.  Or better, when Brian tells a group of sheep-like followers that they must learn to think for themselves because they are all individuals.  &#8220;Yes, we are all individuals,&#8221; they recite back.  The on voice that says, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not,&#8221; is shouted down.  Those who do not accept the symbol of his lost sandal are killed as heritics.</p>
<p>When I first saw it, years ago, it was So funny that it made me cry.</p>

		<p>The reason I called my blog living in a madhouse was because Britain is a world turned upside down, where left is right and black is white. We are not  asked to pretend to believe nonsenses such as &#8220;race is only a social construct&#8221;; &#8220;mass immigration is enriching&#8221;; &#8220;homosexuality is as normal as heterosexuality&#8221; - by definition it is abnormal because it is the minority who practise it - and &#8220;there is no innate difference between men and women&#8221;: rather, the liberal elite insist, as with O&rsquo;Brien and Winston Smith, that we believe these absurdities.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that if the authorities in Britain know you will not play ball and roll over in terror at the sight of a copper they will leave you alone. I know this from the most dramatic personal experience( see https://tinyurl.com/robert156).<br>
What saved me in that case was that I knew instinctively that I had to go on the attack.</p>
<p>The authorities get away with this abuse because, sadly, almost everyone does roll over and apologise or plead guilty if brought to court. </p>
<p>My thanks to whiteplight for putting me right on the Life of Brian which I saw an awfully long time ago. It is a most brilliant political satire and the &#8220;what have the Romans ever done for us&#8221; scene one of the great film comedy moments. </p>
<p>The other political satire of the period which is great is Brazil, which skewers the bureaucratic authoritarian state more exactly than any other I have seen. </p>

		<p>Mr. Simon Shepard is still in prison in the UK. His charges include possession of a comic book and authoring a website. The comic book is readily available at archive.org and the website is hosted in the US. No charges of violence, theft, deciet - charges of actially causing harm - were filed or found. Only &#8216;hate speech.&rsquo;  He fled to the US seeking asylum. A judge who previously granted asylum to an IRA murderer sent him and Stephen Whittle (the Heretical Two) back to the UK. Because of words and picture deemed &#8216;hate,&rsquo; Mr. Shepard is in prison. Mr. Whittle was released, incarcerated again (for reading on a computer in a public library), and is very recently again free. Search for &#8216;the heretical two&rsquo; or read heretical.com. Agreed, some objectionable words and images there. The way to counter them? Ignore these words and images, or present alternatives, or argue against them. Prison is the choice of tyranny. </p>

		<p>I dont know if is too late to add my pennyworth, but here goes:  Mr. Compton is not only a liberal  and believer in multiculturalsm but he did much to help the &#8216;poor maligned muslims&rsquo; of his and other Muslim constituencies by -amongst other things -  having  the CCTV  removed  in &#8216;Muslim areas.&rsquo; <br>
I put  Muslim areas in inverted commas because according to the same  people who quoted this story there is no such thing as &#8216;Muslim areas&rsquo; in Britain. It&rsquo;s all a wicked myth devised by the right wing media and parties like the BNP.  </p>
