			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A respected police sergeant who led a secret double life as head of a ruthless underworld crime family was behind bars tonight.</p>
<p>Salim &#8216;Sal&rsquo; Razaq, 31, became a &#8216;mob boss in police uniform&rsquo; after assuming control of a drug and dirty money racket when his brother went to jail over a vicious turf war.</p>
<p>Officers found two Uzi sub-machine guns and a 9mm Sten sub-machine gun hidden in a suitcase under the stairs, when they raided his suburban home.</p>
<p>They also recovered 224 live rounds of ammunition from a shed, £72,000 in cash plus a knuckle-duster, balaclava and bullet-proof jacket.</p>
<p>Inside the house was a &#8216;tick list&rsquo; of names and amounts of money which police believe refered to drug contacts.</p>
<p>It is suspected he had also been using the police national computer to check on the movements of rival mobsters.</p>
<p>Razaq&rsquo;s amazing double life emerged at Liverpool Crown Court where he was convicted of misconduct in a public office, perverting the course of justice, possession of fireams and ammunition and money laundering.</p>
<p>Colleagues at Nelson Police station in Lancashire regarded Razaq as a &#8216;copper&rsquo;s cop&rsquo;. They had no idea he had turned his home in Chorley Road, Preston, into a gangland HQ.</p>
<p>He was eventually caught after officers routinely picked up on a prison telephone conversation between him and his brother, 25-year old Hafiz in which they talked about a key witness to a kidnapping &#8216;being taken care of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hafiz was known in the Preston underworld as &#8216;The Enforcer&rsquo;, &#8216;Big Haf&rsquo; and &#8216;The Muscle&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Now in Manchester Prison, he admitted perverting the course of justice and money laundering. His mother Gulsham Razaq, 58, of Chester Road, Preston, also admitted the perversion charge.</p>
<p>After Razaq was remanded in custody for sentencing, Andy Cooke, Lancashire&rsquo;s  Assistant Chief Constable said: &#8216;Razaq was nothing short of a criminal in a police uniform.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am appalled that a police officer could be involved at the level he was in this criminality.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are resolute in our commitment to root out any bad apples that fail to maintain the high standards of professional behaviour and integrity which the vast majority of our staff adhere to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Razaq. who was sacked from his £32,000 a year job, had joined the Lancashire force in 2001 and became a sergeant after serving as a traffic officer on the motorway patrol.</p>
<p>At the same time he was being promoted,  his brother was rising through the criminal ranks of the Deepdale drugs gang.</p>
<p>But a turf war broke out in April 2008 when Mohammed Begg, 22, who was linked to the rival Fishwick mob was snatched from his hijacked BMW by a masked gang&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was held captive for three hours during which he was tortured and beaten.</p>
<p>As a result of the kidnapping a 26 year old man from Hafiz&rsquo;s gang was shot in the throat in a revenge attack.</p>
<p>Hafiz himself and four other members of the gang were arrested over Begg&rsquo;s kidnapping and all were jailed for a total of 21 years with Hafiz ordered to serve six.</p>
<p>But police bosses became concerned when they were alerted to telephone calls made by Hafiz to Razaq from Liverpool prison in which they chatted about the case.</p>
<p>Hafiz was later jailed for six years but inquiries continued into his brother and he was arrested in March this year when police staged nine raids at houses across the county.</p>
<p>During the investigation, officers found large amounts of dirty money passing through Razaq&rsquo;s bank accounts.</p>
<p>Jason Lawrenson, 26, of Manchester and Daniel Cookson, 25, of Yewtree Avenue, Ribbleton, admitted money laundering whilst Louis Bamber, 22, of Liverpool, admitted possession of a firearm.</p>
<p>Lancashire Police said there was now an &#8216;in-service&rsquo; vetting programme within the force, where officers are routinely checked to highlight any causes for concern with family members.<br>

		<p>The Police in this country have tried everything they can to get Black and Asian Police officers. <br>
This is what happens when you lower the standards and have quotas in order to get people of colour in a job. They don&rsquo;t leave their third world culture at the border.</p>

<p>It seems White police officers were not blameless in this matter either. A civilisation is not conquered from the outside until it has destroyed itself from within. The degrading moral standards held by Whites is a sign of such a self-destruction, do you not agree?</p>

		<p>Dont trust English police, pure and simple. A report by the largest police force in England about 5 years ago stated that corruption was running at near third world levels and there comments about Muslim police officers was scathing and had to be watered down.</p>
<p>This is the second police officer of shall we say, non English origins, to be jailed recently, previously the head of Black Police association was jailed for trying to frame a guy, MI5 also suspected he was a spy.</p>
<p>A magistrate I work with reckons only 30% tell the truth in court, he routinely ignores evidence from the rest.</p>
<p>Oh the joys of diversity, can we have some more please ? </p>

Appalled?  Really!  The blatant naive stupidity of white bureaucrats challenges reality.  Either that, or they&rsquo;re just cynically disingenuous and don&rsquo;t care anymore.  Majority cops can be bad news.  But what can you expect after turning the force over to Middle Easterners?  Oh well, what Brit has time for this when next year&rsquo;s World Cup must be prepared for?  Go Mohammad! <br>

		<p>I can tell you with almost 100 % precision that &#8220;Sal&#8221; joined the police with the intent of being bad from the start. He did not become &#8220;bad&#8221; after joining the force, he was bad before that and had the badness in his mind long before he became a &#8220;copper&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sal&#8221; was just a plain old ordinary bad guy from the start. </p>
<p>Joining the force makes an excellent cover for being a gangster. All sorts of perks, including the ability to control investigations against your own &#8220;crew&#8221;.</p>
<p>And I bet too that all the other officers around &#8220;Sal&#8221; thought the man was the greatest thing going too.</p>

		<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not like they are going to divide the blue wall and point fingers but: &#8216;A copper&rsquo;s cop&rsquo; raised a eyebrow with me:</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Cop or Copper <br>
While commonly believed to be an acronym for Constable On Patrol, the term refers to &#8220;one who captures or snatches&#8221;. This word first appeared in the early 18th century, and can be matched with the word &#8220;cap&#8221;, which has the same meaning and whose etymology can be traced to the Latin word &#8216;capere&rsquo;. (The word retains this meaning in other contexts: teenagers &#8220;cop a feel&#8221; on a date, and they have also been known to &#8220;cop an attitude&#8221;.) Variation: Copper. It is also believed that the term Copper was the original, unshortened word, popularly believed to represent the copper badges American officers used to wear at the time of origin, but in fact probably used in Britain to mean &#8220;someone who cops&#8221; long before this.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2zp3h3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2zp3h3</a></p>
<p>I guess every once in awhile, the name does fit, &#8216;even if you have to go to Arabia to get the archetype&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Something I think needs to be said here while we&rsquo;re in the process of giving away our best jobs, lifestyle and sympathies to the wretched villainy of the planet.  Immigrants come in two stripes: Infiltrators who have the money to influence the gullible to get what they want (more wealth).  And Failures who will prey on those who try hard because they were never &#8216;good&rsquo;, at anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.  Far from the mythic underdog on a foreordained quest to improve his station in life through staunch adherence to a moral center, most immigrants, including our own past ones, _failed_, for one reason or another, to become useful members of their parent societies and so fled or were encouraged to leave, rather than face continued non-assimilation and possible large scale criminal consequences.</p>
<p>In the West, we Europeans were tamed by the act of conquering a new land.  With the result you see all around you: Modernity.  Decency.  The Rule Of Law.  Potential To Grow Further.</p>
<p>Other places were not so lucky.  Christians and Jews (Hindus and Zoroastrians) were slaughtered by the rise of Islam.  Indians of the Americas captured and butchered each other in the thousands for most of their neolithic history.  Chaining primitivism to drive the engine of society is like chaining a dragon to cook your dinner.</p>
<p>And especially today, to invite ethnically differentiated immigrants from backwards or even non-existent societies into our softer, morally cultured, landscape without the &#8220;You shall succeed or die trying&hellip;&#8221; environmental motivator to try hard is a recipe for disaster.  Because they do not become tempered, do not smooth off the rough edges, do not leave behind the impulse to be dominators, bullies, predators, thieves.</p>
<p>Coppers.</p>
<p>Back in the day, when &#8216;Social Studies&rsquo; aka History class actually took pride in teaching American History to White American students, I remember one particular image of someone fleeing from the Oklahoma Territories during the early years of their settlement.  The man was driving a war chariot pulled by two bears driven on by whip made of rattlesnakes with a shotgun across his knees and a puma sitting beside him.</p>
<p>The caption you ask?</p>
<p>&#8220;They gave the weak ones a day to git.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we do not want our cultured societies to take a turn back towards hellish primitivism, that&rsquo;s an image we need to be mindful of, every time one of our sainted moronic altruists in government decides to import another boatload of the &#8216;hapless&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There has been many found out but rather forced to &#8216;resign.&rsquo; This is a nice clean  way of avoiding a fuss and the added stigma of so much corruption, especially prevalent amongst these third worlders, ruining  the reputation of the wider police  force. </p>
<p>The guy you&rsquo;re hinting at is this guy (link given.)The most dangerous man in the Met? | Mail Online  The central drama of the book concerns Operation Helios, the extraordinary Scotland Yard investigation into corruption allegations made ..</p>
<p><br>
Finally caught and imprisoned when a member of his own community decided to offer evidence against him. (The politically correct white Met had been trying to get him for years but kept getting held back by the so called &#8216;Black Police Officers Association&rsquo;  with  the inevitable allegations of racism). However now he&rsquo;s gone down it doesnt seem to have taught this ex superintendent very much. Since he has been in prison (a soft open prison at that) he has got himself into a number of altercations and  fights and each time he&rsquo;s been beaten down has attempted to play the race card.  </p>
<p>Good riddance.  </p>
<p>And keep up the good work. In Britain most people are just so unbelievably apathetic about this problem and the truth of the threat we&rsquo;re now facing all over Europe. </p>

<p>Very sad.  Indeed, it&rsquo;s appalling.  But I would imagine that &#8220;most people&#8221;  are too intimidated by the race laws and are afraid to say anything or even show any interest,  so they simply shut up and withdraw into themselves. Or into obsessing over the next soccer match.  Now, that&rsquo;s a safe interest to have!</p>

		<p>@ 8: Well were whites involved in this syndicate? Yes. Do I see declining moral standards among whites? Yes. And this incident is just proof of what I believe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree that Whites are just as bad as the &#8220;minorities&#8221;, as they are statistically less likely to commit crimes. But I DO believe they can be bad, as can be seen by such incidents.</p>
<p>Evil comes in all colours, and although blacks (and Paskistanis) commit more crime than whites, whites are not immmune from ill-behaviour and any white who commits crimes brings shame upon his race.<br>
Keep in mind that I express what I believe is the truth. in this case, white officers did have a role in the crime, and for that I believe that members on the site should condemn them for damaging the reputation of the white race.</p>

<p>I am so sick of hearing that phrase! People who say this are trying to minimize what nonwhites do at such alarming rates! Pray tell me, what is the ratio to one&rsquo;s population, that Whites are evil also?  </p>
<p> You can believe what you want to, but most evil comes from NONwhites and at rates that is disapportinate to their numbers in all White nations! Look I grew up in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s and people like you try to tell us that it was a bad era for blacks, etc. NO it wasn&rsquo;t! At least they had jobs and a father in the home!  WHITES were the majority back then and I NEVER saw all this crime, corruption, and evil deeds you claim by the majority of White people!  So don&rsquo;t try to tell those of us who know better to NOT believe our own eyes and ears and experiences at that time!</p>

No, there you go again!   Why do you read negativity into everything?  Why be so negative?  He said nothing of the kind. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take his part here, because you are over-simplifying and distorting his words.  He did NOT say  <i>&#8220;whites are just as bad&#8221;  </i>as minorities.    That&rsquo;s rubbish!   He said that it seems there were white police officers &#8220;who were not blameless&#8221;. (Not all.)   Nor did he speak of all whites, generically,.   Nor did he say &#8220;always&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s your word which YOU inserted!  </p>
<p>His point about decay from within is a very good one, and that we are more easily conquered from within than from without when we have been softened up. I do agree with him that when our institutions (such as police departments) are invaded by alien cultures/peoples,  these institutions tend to become corrupted and the standards  inevitably fall. (Can that even be denied? The above story proves it!)  </p>
<p>White European Christians are not prefect, and I don&rsquo;t claim we are, but other non-European cultures/peoples tend to be  more lax, more casual,   about corruption and the moral standards that we  traditionally uphold. And once they&rsquo;re in the system, they affect everything around them. I have seen this myself.   This is a fact that needs to be recognized and faced, not glossed over (as our governments desperately try to do)</p>
<p>When a superior  officer  in the police department, as above, is morally deficient, to put it politely,  his inferiors will have to keep their mouths shut -  if only for their own good.   If they want their jobs. He sets the standard which others are expected to follow.  They don&rsquo;t have to be better than he is. They have to go along.</p>
<p>Stating this fact does not amount to saying that &#8220;all whites are just as bad.&#8221;<br>
That is an absurd exaggeration. </p>
<p>Which gets back to the Jefferson quote:  <i>&#8220;There is not a truth existing which I fear or would wish uninown to the whole world.&#8221; </i>   Would you argue with that statement too?</p>

He said that it seems there were white police officers &ldquo;who were not blameless&rdquo;. (Not all.) Nor did he speak of all whites, generically,. Nor did he say &ldquo;always&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s your word which YOU inserted! <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>MY negativity?  Maybe you need to read all of his posts here on amren for starters. You wouldn&rsquo;t happen to be the same poster, would you?</p>
<p>BTW, he did not answer the question of where are the White police officers in that article? He was talking about the police officers in that ARTICLE. Maybe you need to read his post #2. </p>

		<p>Here in the U.S. gangs routinely order junior members to join the military to learn how to use advanced weaponry and tactics.  It&rsquo;s so bad that the army has made reports about this as being widespread.</p>
<p>When social order breaks down, the gangs are coming to YOUR house with heavy weaponry.  What can our little shotguns do in return?  Will our latino, asian, arab, black neighbors join together with us to protect us?  You know the answer.</p>
<p>The only, and I mean only reason I look forward to that day is to see liberals, social justice lackeys, multi-cultural advocates, etc on their knees being abused and worse by the &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; masses they used to champion and bring more of into this once great land.</p>

<p>I think you have a very good question there.</p>
<p>And I note that none of our gun fanatics have  answered it.</p>
