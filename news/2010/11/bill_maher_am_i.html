<h1>Bill Maher: Am I Racist to Feel Alarmed by the Thought of Islam Taking Over the Western World?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Nolte, Big Hollywood, October 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While Jon Stewart puts on his on his safely PC Detached Irony Mock-Fest a little later today, keep this unexpected moment from last night&rsquo;s Real Time with Bill Maher in mind. After noting that Mohammed is now the most popular name for newborns in Britain, Bill Maher stopped his panel and audience cold by asking, &#8220;Am I racist to feel alarmed by that? Because I am. And it&rsquo;s not because of the race, it&rsquo;s because of the religion. I don&rsquo;t have to apologize, do I, for not wanting the Western world to be taken over by Islam in 300 years?&#8221;</p>
<p>This clip is an excellent representation of how insidious political correctness has become, we can&rsquo;t even stand up for own culture anymore without a few hundred people acting as though Bill Maher just lit a cross on fire. Multiculturalism is now the highest value on the Left  &mdash;  the tolerating of intolerance in the name of racial sensitivity  &mdash;  which is why the slow creep of Sharia Law has gained a foothold in the Western world. A couple weeks ago, on the air, Maher scolded Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas over the title of his book &#8220;American Taliban,&#8221; by saying in effect, &#8220;I love you Markos, but we are not the Taliban.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There are many things I disagree with Bill Maher on, but he is %100 right on this issue. I don&rsquo;t think anyone in the West, or the developed world for that matter, wants Europe to become Islamic. Islam threatens not only Western culture, but also our values. </p>
<p><br>
However, I would go one-step farther and say that I do not want masses of non-Europeans moving into Europe. <br>

		<p>Jon Stewart&rsquo;s estimate that it would take 300 years for the Western World to be taken over by Islam is way too optimistic; Given the current trends, I would say that in merely one tenth of this time span will major European cities become majority muslim, followed by the whole European continent in less than 100 years.</p>
<p>As for how to encounter this development, the guy lacks ideas or refuses to name any in order not to qualify for a genuine racism certificate. Almost no one has gotten the stomach yet to admit the only viable and effective measure: The geographic seperation of the Western World from the Islamic.</p>

		<p>Nice to see Maher do this, it complements the Juan Williams comment about Muslims causing anxiety. But this guy makes big bucks belittling anyone who objects to PC America. If Europeans ever regain control of the country LBJ, Kennedys and Obama stole from the founding group that made the USA a nation of civilization and not savagery, the Mahers, Stewarts and Obermanns will have to go. Along with the current Constitution which has been so bastardized by the Warren and subsequent courts that it might as well have been drafted by Trotsky and WEB DuBois,not by Madison, Hamilton, Franklin et al.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it HIM who called the 9/11 hijackers &#8220;brave&#8221;?  Hasn&rsquo;t it been HIM who has continually mocked and slandered Christians?  Hasn&rsquo;t it been HIM who has been for everything leftward and &#8220;progressive&#8221; while sneering at anything moderate or rightward?  Wonder what happened.  Did he finally figure out that his being a Jew trumps his pandering to Islam in the eyes of the Taliban, Bin Ladin, the Saudis, the Hamas, etc?  He wasn&rsquo;t all that afraid of Islam when it was Bush trying to defeat Islamic terrorism.  Suddenly he&rsquo;s afraid of Islam and fears that it will take over the western world?  Duh.  And they call these guys smart?  Well, we don&rsquo;t.  They themselves call themselves smart and sneer at our &#8220;ignorance&#8221;.  </p>

<p>Which is exactly what Comrade Maher wants!</p>
<p>Sorry, but  Mr. Bill made a point, a &ldquo;brave point&rdquo; according to his comrades and other assorted chirping and yowling Red troglodytes, that 9/11 was what we had coming to us as a country. Now he fiddles, while Rome burns: good show Mr. Bill; however, I hope this is what the future holds for you, Comrade Maher, AKA, MR. BILL:</p>

		<p>I find this both typical and laughable. Here we have someone who lives in America, becomes wealthy, enjoys the blessings of liberty, and yet whose main claim to fame is the trashing of Western Society.  Now that he sees the threat that his precious liberalism has wrought, he has a revelation and is expressing fear and worry.  And of course he throws in the &#8220;&hellip;it&rsquo;s not because of the race&#8221; comment in a feeble attempt at self-righteousness. More than (probably) being a closet racist, he is mainly a hypocrite. <br>

		<p>Most here probably care little for Bill Maher - I certainly do not.  But give him credit: one annoying habit of most of those who consider themselves atheists would sooner pray the rosary before making any public warnings, no matter how innocuous, against Islam.  He&rsquo;s done it before (see: Religilous), and it&rsquo;s a safe bet he&rsquo;ll do it again.</p>

		<p>Yes Bill, you are a racist - one of the most perniciously anti-White commentators around.</p>
<p>But in the case of Islam, &#8220;racist&#8221; is not the correct descriptor to apply to you.  If you think it will take 300 years before Islam is trying to conquer us, &#8220;deluded&#8221; is a more accurate term.  You&rsquo;re off by an order of magnitude.  Try 30 - 50 years.</p>

		<p>When I started posting at Knoxville&rsquo;s newspaper site, knoxnews.com, several years ago, it was extremely difficult to post anything about race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>Two things IMO have caused a perceptible loosening in that: the flood of hispanics into the country, and the increasing level of news about muslims/Islam in the West.</p>
<p>The Hispanic flood alone wasn&rsquo;t enough to do it&hellip;one could mildly criticize the Hispanic presence, but it didn&rsquo;t carry over to being able to criticize any other group. On an article about a mosque in Knoxville arguing with a neighbor restaurant over the restaurant&rsquo;s serving alcohol, the thread was simply shut down in order to block all the angry &#8220;pro-restaurant&#8221; posts.</p>
<p>But the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; stance of the newspaper has lately been overwhelmed by the news itself, about muslims this and muslims that, and now there&rsquo;s no reasonable way they can stifle the flood of angry commentary, so they permit it.</p>
<p>And since the threads there now are filled with angry commentary about muslims, I suppose it&rsquo;s begun to feel quite natural to the monitors to allow similar commentary (of a milder form) on other races and ethnicities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the change, and also by the possibility that no one there has noticed it (including the monitors)&hellip;I could be wrong about that.</p>
<p>When Obama made his race speech and said we should have a conversation about race, I laughed so hard, thinking, if that naive man only knew how much he does NOT want such a thing!</p>
<p>That suggestion by Obama (and his mere presence in the presidency), the Hispanic flood, the muslim encroachment&hellip;.so many things have been eating away at the prohibition against whites being allowed to talk about race.</p>

<p>Bill is still anti-white. If you&rsquo;re not a racist, you&rsquo;re anti-white.</p>
<p>Islam is not the problem. Have you no eyes Bill, to not notice 99% of Muslims aren&rsquo;t white?</p>
<p>If whites became Muslim, whites would civilize Islam, just like they eventually civilized Christianity.</p>

		<p>Having seen the Bill Maher-narrated documentary &#8220;Religulous&#8221; when it hit the theaters two years ago, I can vouch for the fact that Maher dislikes radical Islam as much as he does all other forms of unquestioning religious certitude.  And good for him.  Religious fundamentalism, Christian and Jewish included, is a cancer upon civilized societies.  I don&rsquo;t want it in mine. </p>
<p>Thus, his recent statement comes as no shock.  It is fully consonant with his previous statements on Islam.  He no more &#8220;trashes&#8221; America than other freethinkers have.  Good to have him around.    </p>

I&rsquo;d much prefer they mate with Asians than latinos and certainly blacks.  Don&rsquo;t write us off yet.  White men are good fighters when pushed into a corner.  We have a long history to prove it!  Besides, no white woman worth her salt would mate with a nonwhite man.  </p>

		<p>This is actually a good thing for our side guys! Political correctness has strangled debate about Muslim intentions and Maher&rsquo;s comment helps open the debate up. The fact that he is one of them causes pain to the left. That&rsquo;s a good thing. We know how the loony left acts when cornered and forced to confront uncomfortable truths.

		<p>Communism and Islam are both philosophies about how to live your life and structure society.  Neither is a race or ethnicity.  </p>
<p>Note that for the last 60 years, a main focus of our government was to propagandize against communism, because we believed that communism was a harmful way of life.  However, today, anyone who believes that Islam represents a harmful way of life, is branded an intolerant racist.  What a twisted, cynical world we live in. </p>

<p>As a white man, I do have a problem with people of Arabic descent. Notwithstanding the probability that Islam will wipe out these people as well, I now have a problem with all colored people. My gut instinct tells me Western Civilization is in grave peril. If we lose the power to enforce the laws that keep human nature in check, we will rue the day. The colored people will take our stuff and take our women. </p>
<p>As Anonymous says, &ldquo;White women will mate with the winners.&rdquo; And this brings me to another point of consternation. Not to disparage the astute women who post to American Renaissance, I have a problem with women in general who seem ambivalent about the freedom and equality they enjoy in the Western World. I&rsquo;m afraid a majority of them will not have our backs when push comes to shove.   <br>

		<p>When ever you start feeling down and depressed that Europe, the West will be conquered by Arab/Pakistani/Asian Muslims - Islam, just look a bit East to&hellip;</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>Our kinsmen the Russians have never taken any gruff from NW Muslims - go google the painter of the Cossacks drinking and composing a vulgar filled insult to some Ottoman Turk Sultan. The Cossacks are back in Ukraine and Mother Russia - don&rsquo;t think the Chetnian Muslims or any NW Muslims will be taking over Mother Russia any time soon, or ever.</p>

<p>Actually, I have seen demographic experts say that even if all Muslim immigration stopped now in Europe, it&rsquo;s too late: the numbers are so skewed that Europeans can never catch up. It is cold hard mathematics. </p>

		<p>Islam may not be a &#8216;race&rsquo;, but when one speaks of &#8216;Islamification&rsquo; you can be sure it means non-whites colonizing white lands.</p>
<p>So it is a race issue.</p>

<p>Although I am a fan of neither Bill Maher or Juan Williams   &mdash;   both have said things over the years that make it clear they are no friends of white people   &mdash;   I will say in their defense that both these left-wing stalwarts have been attacked by their own kind merely for saying things that are NORMAL, things that are SANE, things that are not only true, they are virtually SELF-EVIDENT. </p>
<p>Bill Maher worrying about Islam&rsquo;s aggressive expansionism and Juan Williams admitting his fear of airborne Mohammedans with a burqa full of boxcutters   &mdash;   both of these men are merely expressing concerns about their own SELF-PRESERVATION. </p>
<p>And self-preservation   &mdash;   or the survival instinct, if you prefer   &mdash;   is the most normal and natural thing in the world. In fact, there&rsquo;s something wrong with you if you DON&rsquo;T have one. These guys just don&rsquo;t want to be killed, that&rsquo;s all.  </p>
<p>But then, castigating people and firing them from their jobs just for talking like a normal sane healthy person is what happens when the lunatics take over the asylum, isn&rsquo;t it? The loonies take their revenge on the sane   &mdash;   even when the sane are usually known for mouthing fashionable platitudes (like Maher); or have a fashionable complexion (like Williams). </p>

		<p>My fear is that by the time us forward thinking *&rsquo;haters&rsquo; are vindicated, it will already be too late. </p>
<p>*(ethno patriots, cultural preservationists, conservatives, traditonalists or genetic White conservationists etc).</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with wanting your tribe to retain its numerial dominance, thus for your own people&rsquo;s culture to survive-thrive.<br>
Anything less is suicidal and is a luxery that should be left for the leemings.<br>
And frankly whose other culture would we want to live in anyway, when we have one that was already tailor made for us (by us)?<br>
Whenever we try to make our standards &#8216;one size fits all&rsquo;, we always end up with nothing.</p>

		<p>Well, here I go again.<br>
 Multiculturalism, which is the movement that has benefited Islam by conferring upon it a sheen of acceptability because it is &#8220;non-Western&#8221; and thus righteous, is not a forever thing. It is a chic and ephemeral thing; doomed to be discarded by the people of the USA when they face economic reality. When it becomes clear that the number one problem this nation faces has nothing to do with religion or &#8220;terror&#8221; but rather with the gigantically huge amount of money we owe China, we will became amnesiac about this issue, as well we should. WE face permanent peonage, not the Islamic hordes in the dusty Mideast. WE are going to be giving our money to China forever (underline that) because debt compounds. Mideastern nations are either insanely rich or dirt poor, and their governments either do not have to borrow to improve their peoples&rsquo; lot or don&rsquo;t care to. The USA has made the dreadfully stupid decision to borrow from a competitor, and is now whistling in the dark. We are going to be squeezed in a great geopolitical vise of energy-hungry, cash rich and militant China and oil-rich Arabia. The ethnocentric Chinese will set the cultural tone in the 21st century, not the multicultural &#8220;elites&#8221; of the sinking USA.</p>

In the rest of your post you demonstrate why a Muslim takeover of Europe is not irreversible, and why there are no tipping points.  A backlash against Muslim immigrants already seems to be building in Europe. <br>

		<p>Racism as it is used by the media simply means any actions white Christian Americans take to have racial, religious solidarity or to protect themselves against those who see a different America than the one established by white Christians.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean I wanted Arabs to immigrate here.  I&rsquo;m just saying that as people they&rsquo;re not a threat if they don&rsquo;t subscribe to Islam.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for Christian Arabs who are being persecuted by followers of Muhammad.</p>
<p>And Arabs aren&rsquo;t the only followers of Islam.  I&rsquo;m thinking of NOI.</p>

		<p>Alexandra,</p>
<p>Herein lays the dilemma for many white people. On an individual basis there are colored people who for all practical purposes are decent human beings. This creates conflict in one&rsquo;s mind when trying to form an opinion of them in the aggregate. History tells me that long-term, colored people are a threat to the white race regardless of what religion they practice. It makes my heart sad. <br>
