<h1> Court Upholds In-State Tuition for Some Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Elias, Yahoo News, Nov. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The California Supreme Court weighed in Monday on the politically charged immigration fray when it ruled that illegal immigrants are entitled to the same tuition breaks offered to in-state high school students to attend public colleges and universities.</p>
<p>While the ruling applies only to California, the case was closely watched nationally because nine other states, including New York and Texas, have similar laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit considered by the court was part of a broader legal assault led by immigration legal scholar Kris Kobach, who has filed numerous cases across the country seeking to restrict the rights of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>He represented a group of U.S. students who filed the lawsuit seeking to invalidate the California law.</p>
<p>Kobach said he would appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>A unanimous state Supreme Court, led by politically conservative Justice Ming Chin, said the California provision was constitutional because U.S. residents also had access to the reduced rates.</p>
<p>The California Legislature passed the controversial measure in 2001 that allowed any student, regardless of immigration status, who attended a California high school for at least three years and graduated to qualify for in-state tuition at the state&rsquo;s colleges and universities. In-state tuition saves each state college student about $11,000 a year and each University of California student about $23,000 a year.</p>
<p>A state appellate court ruled in 2008 the law was unconstitutional after a group of out-of-state students who are U.S. citizens filed a lawsuit. The suit alleged the measure violated federal prohibitions barring illegal immigrants from receiving post-secondary benefits not available to U.S. citizens based on state residency.</p>
<p>However, the state Supreme Court noted the California law says nothing about state residency, a distinction that foes of the plan said shouldn&rsquo;t matter. Kobach said the federal legislation was meant to prohibit exactly what the California Supreme Court allowed for illegal immigrants on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It presents a rather incomprehensible reading of the federal statute,&#8221; Kobach said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state law also requires illegal immigrants who apply for the in-state tuition to swear they will attempt to become U.S. citizens. The applicants are still barred from receiving federal financial aid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through their hard work and perseverance, these students have earned the opportunity to attend UC,&#8221; said University of California president Mark G. Yudof. &#8220;Their accomplishments should not be disregarded or their futures jeopardized.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democratic leaders in Washington, D.C., are mulling whether to try to pass immigration reform measures before they lose control of the House of Representatives in January.</p>
<p>During his re-election campaign, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., promised to try to get a vote on the &#8220;DREAM Act,&#8221; which would create a path to citizenship for youth living in the country illegally who attend college or join the military.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Luis Miranda said the administration welcomes any opportunity for Congress to take up the proposal. The legislation &#8220;is important to both our national security and our economy,&#8221; Miranda said.</p>

The news from California just gets more and more surreal by the day. Is anybody still in charge there? <br>

		<p>What this translates into is that the California Supreme Court has just ruled that citizenship is meaningless.  </p>
<p>In their new, globalistic world, citizenship is an old, outdated concept that is being consciously phased out. </p>
<p>Hello, Marxist one-world utopia!  Goodbye, bad old USA.</p>

		<p>&#8220;California Supreme Court decision let illegals pay reduced tuition rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, why not?  I mean, California doesn&rsquo;t need the money any way. </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a joke if the country were somehow inundated instantly with about 10 million white illegals from all over the world?<br>

		<p>Do I think this is insane? Yes. However I do believe in states rights, and if California is foolish enough to give a break to illegals in their university system, so be it.</p>
<p>Of course I will admit that state universities take federal money, and that means citizens of other states have contributed, so based on that, students from other states may have a case. By taking the federal handout, California may forfeit some of their rights.</p>
<p>We are living in an insane world. This sort of nonsense proves it.</p>

		<p>The best that can come out of this is for several states to come together and issue a resolution complimenting Cali on its States&rsquo; Rights, then condemn Cali for rewarding illegals before helping all the other states export their illegals into Cali.</p>
<p>Then each state needs to immediately exercise their rights to ban illegal aliens from their territory and impeach any federal employee who didn&rsquo;t do their job of deporting these threats.</p>

		<p>Being illegal carries few disadvantages and increasingly more advantages.  Non-residents, say those from adjoining Arizona, do not have California state residency and hence are not eligible for reduced tuition in California.  But apparently a non-citizen living in California (or claiming to be living in California) does qualify for tuition reduction.  Question: if you aren&rsquo;t allowed to ask an illegal if they are a citizen, then why are you allowed to ask them if they are a resident?<br>
As egregious as that is also note that there are a finite number of students a university can accommodate.  Thus for illegal resident that attends the University, it &#8220;crowds out&#8221; or displaces a legal resident.  Of course you can make the University bigger so all can go to school below cost with the difference subsidized by the state.  Any wonder why California is functionally bankrupt?  Social altruism they can&rsquo;t afford.  Oh wait the Federal government will transfer some money to California to make up for their profligate spending and budget gap.  Thank you out-of-state taxpayer.  You get to pay for California&rsquo;s altruism to illegals even though you as an out-of-state resident can&rsquo;t take advantage of California tuition reductions that illegals can.<br>
Yes it is humane to educate illegals, but more humane to deport them and save the taxpayer the burden of supporting illegal residents.<br>
&#8220;In principle, you ought to have completely open immigration. But with the welfare state it&rsquo;s really not possible to do that&hellip; .&#8221; Milton Friedman</p>

		<p>Wonderful logic for being illegal. You are in this country  as an illegal, but everything you do is somehow legal. </p>
<p>Housing, Schooling, medical, it is all legal. No questions asked.</p>
<p>Illegals do have it rough breaking our laws and entering our country without permission tho. So it makes perfect sense to try and help them out when attending American schools. Forget about  the overlooked, poor, American whites. Nah, let us help the illegals who  should not even be here to begin with. That&rsquo;s the ticket. </p>

<p>  &mdash;  Anon #9</p>
<p>I was angry about this all day yesterday.  But not surprised.</p>
<p>I not only have to pay to subsidize California&rsquo;s UCs and CSUs I have to cover illegals&rsquo; tuition as well (and medical care and educational expenses and food and housing and&hellip;.).</p>
<p>Not only are illegals eligible for in-state tuition, they qualify for AA benefits in the UC and CSUs&rsquo; admissions&rsquo; zero sum game, especially as the universities and government fight tooth and nail to invalidate California&rsquo;s 209.</p>
<p>Our &#8220;new&#8221; Useful Idiot governor is fighting to overturn Props 13 (claiming &#8220;evereything is on the table&#8221;) and 209.  PLF (Pacific Legal Foundation) reports the following:</p>
<p><i>Jerry Brown has already tried to sabotage Prop. 209 by sending a brief to the state Supreme Court calling it unconstitutional</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Prop 209 AND Prop 13 are considered unconstitutional.  And yes, the Feds may bail us out but that is a temporary fix and does nothing to solve the long-term budget shortfalls created by importing a large welfare-draining, non-taxpaying, non-White base and fomenting an overtly hostile climate for businesses marked by onerous regulations and satanic taxes.</p>
<p>I see no way out for us considering the political atmosphere and the deteriorating quality of life in California.</p>
<p>I may be forced out of the state with nothing but my life.</p>
<p>California will implode (but then, maybe that&rsquo;s The Prime Directive).</p>

		<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t an illegal alien pay reduced tuition based upon their residency?  If someone lives here they qualify, by definition, as a resident. Their immigration status is a federal issue, not a state one.</p>
<p>And those of you who think they don&rsquo;t pay their way are very much unaware of how money circulates within the immigrant community. Ask any landlord in Los Angeles if he wants to get rid of immigrants.  Hell no, they keep vacancy rates low and property values (aka cash flow) high. Apartment resell values in the Los Angeles area prove this point. Get rid of the immigrants and property values plummet - see Phoenix, AZ.</p>
<p>And btw, I completely agree with the comment: &#8220;It would be rediculous to keep that individual ignorant and in poverty, how does that better society?<br>
As an individual makes more, they pay more.  Thus we need to encourage everyone to pursue an education and a higher standard of living.  Get smart people.</p>

<p>Yes, everyone should get smart about the cost of illegal immigration to Native Born Americans, Californians in particular.</p>
<p>FAIR reports:</p>
<p><i>California&rsquo;s illegal immigrant population is costing the state&rsquo;s taxpayers more than $10.5 billion per year for education, medical care and incarceration. <b>Even if the estimated tax contributions of illegal immigrant workers are subtracted, net outlays still amount to nearly $9 billion per year. The annual fiscal burden from those three areas of state expenditures amounts to about $1,183 per household headed by a native-born resident.</b></i></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><i>State and local taxes paid by the unauthorized immigrant population go toward offsetting these costs, but they do not come near to matching the expenses.</i></p>
<p>Source:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qvq9w" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/qvq9w</a></p>
<p>Do you think the exorbitant cost of illegal immigration may be why California has a huge budget hole of six billion dollars?  Or is it because the socialists in the legislature have driven out productive businesses and tax-paying Whites via satanic taxes and onerous business regulations?  Or maybe Native Born Californians don&rsquo;t like the degradation of the quality of life caused by illegal immigration.</p>
<p><i>Fifty percent of Hispanic households use some form of welfare, the highest rate of any major population group.</i></p>
<p><i>Hispanics are 3.3 times more likely to be in prison than whites; they are 4.2 times more likely to be in prison for murder; 3.9% of Hispanic men aged 25-29 are in prison or jail, vs. 1.7 percent of Whites  Young Hispanics are 19 times more likely than young Whites  be in youth gangs.</i></p>
<p>Source:  <i>Hispanics:  A Statistical Portrait</i>:   <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yz6wkjo" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yz6wkjo</a></p>
<p>You write <i>Get rid of the immigrants and property values plummet</i>:</p>
<p>Yeah, tell that to Native Born Californians who have had to sell their homes at a loss as their neighborhood deteriorates and becomes more dangerous due to an influx of illegal immigrants, more crowded as illegals pack 20 into one house, and the local schools become filled with non-English speaking children.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s what drives up property values or causes them to plummet?</p>
<p>I wonder why so many of my neighbors are putting up 9-foot fences and surrounding their properties with digital cameras switched to &#8216;on&rsquo; 24 hours a day?  Could it be because of all the White criminals roaming LA as shown on Law &amp; Order: Los Angeles?</p>
<p>I wonder why so many nice, safe neighborhoods (as exactly advertised by the Real Estate section of the local papers) are behind iron gates with 24-hour guards, patrolled by security companies with &#8220;armed response&#8221; written on the side of its cars?</p>
<p>Yeah, must be all those White criminals and Nazis making life hell in Southern California! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on reserve power at the moment or I&rsquo;d give you a lesson on Hispanic Drunk Drivers, one of whom drove into a group of motorcyclists this past weekend killing four.  </p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re White Californians, a hated minority, so who cares.</p>

<p><br>
BTW:  If you have <b>facts</b> to refute FAIR&rsquo;s assessment of the cost of illegal immigration, <b>facts showing that illegal immigrants &#8216;raise property values in California&rsquo;, or <b>facts</b> to refute the huge number of hispanics who drive drunk, please post them.  </b></p>
<p>Remember, facts only, not opinion, and from reliable sources as well. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be waiting.</p>

<p>What is happening in L.A. is not a feature, it&rsquo;s a bug.  And vice versa for Phoenix.  Of course recent immigrants, legal and illegal, make landlords happy, because Hispanics cram jamming into apartments means that there are numerous potential rent payers in any given domicile.  This drives rents up.  And that hurts native born white Americans who live in households with only one or two income earners.</p>
<p>As for property values plummetting   &mdash;   Good.  It should, because it never should have been that high.  This is the one element of the campaign rhetoric of most Republicans this past election cycle which made me cringe   &mdash;   Of course property values are going down   &mdash;   Maybe now native born white Americans in the working middle class can actually afford property.</p>
