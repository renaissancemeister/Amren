<h1>India&rsquo;s Punjab Celebrates Nikki Haley&rsquo;s Election</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nirmala George, The State (Columbia, South Carolina), November 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Nikki Haley won election last week as governor of South Carolina, a small town halfway across the world in India&rsquo;s Punjab exploded in celebration.</p>
<p>The Randhawa family in the town of Verka distributed sweets to neighbors, set off firecrackers and broke into traditional Punjabi dances to demonstrate its pride that a relative had been elected the first Indian-American female governor in U.S. history.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were eating lunch when we saw the breaking news headline on TV that Nikki had won the elections. We just abandoned lunch and ran to tell family and neighbors,&#8221; said Kanwaljit Singh Randhawa, Haley&rsquo;s cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife began dancing the bhangra and our neighbors joined in. My son ran out and bought firecrackers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Haley was born Nimrata Randhawa to Sikh parents who had immigrated to the United States from India in the early 1960s. The 38-year-old mother of two is widely known by her Americanized first name, Nikki, and her married name, Haley.</p>
<p>The tea party-backed Republican candidate, who is a Christian, won 51 percent of the vote against Democratic state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, who received 47 percent.</p>
<p>The win resonated in Verka, a town known for its milk products and enormous dairy farms. The Randhawas  &mdash;  Haley&rsquo;s paternal uncle, his three sons and their families  &mdash;  were flooded with visitors and congratulatory phone calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our girl has made us proud,&#8221; Randhawa said by telephone from Verka, 280 miles (450 kilometers) north of New Delhi.</p>
<p>The news about Haley&rsquo;s victory was the top story on Indian TV stations, and camera crews swooped down on Randhawa&rsquo;s modest middle class Verka home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a great honor not just for our family, but it&rsquo;s an honor for Punjab and for the country,&#8221; Randhawa said.</p>
<p>Punjab&rsquo;s top elected official, Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal, said Haley had earned laurels for her home state, although she was born in the United States and has made only one visit to India at age 4.</p>
<p>Indians are immensely proud of emigrants who make it big abroad, hailing them as celebrities and holding up their success as a role model for millions of aspiring youth.</p>
<p>It was the same when Bobby Jindal, whose family also migrated from Punjab, was elected Louisiana governor three years ago. Overnight, Jindal became a household name in India.</p>
<p>Randhawa said the family and village chiefs from around Verka were busy planning a victory party for Haley, though the guest of honor was not expected to attend.</p>
<p>Randhawa, a retired high school teacher, said some family members plan to visit Haley in the United States when she takes her oath of office in January.</p>
<p>&#8220;My uncle, Nikki&rsquo;s father, has said he will send us the invitation for the ceremony and we hope we can make it. It would be such a proud moment for all of us,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>Yeah, but   &mdash;  - Jim DeMint won 63% to 28%.  A Republican running for Governor in a Republican state in a Republican friendly year ought to do better than 51-47.  It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious why her margin wasn&rsquo;t bigger.</p>

<p>They pursue whites, and covet our success, our customs, our territory, and even our genetics.</p>
<p>An Indian living in the West will unapologetically think of himself as a legitimate competitor for our wealth, land, and even a white mate. </p>

		<p>actually, the Aryans were in India until they got submerged by interbreeding with some of the less than desirable natives.  and the Aryan civilization was in the Pubjab/Indus Valley which &#8220;nikki&#8221; is from.  the caste system was installed to save the Aryan civilization but it did work as shown by history.  Moral of this posting, this country has to be careful with its gene pool.  But it has been brainwashed to do the reverse.  Scary.  Ancient Greeks/Egyptians/Northern Europeans all came from the same gene pool as the Aryans.</p>

		<p>Anonymous wrote at 7:10 PM, that goes for every non-white race.  White people are the group every non-white wants to be like and surpass.  Indians and East Asians are the most obsessed.  </p>
<p>The American South now has TWO Indian Governors.  Unfortunately, the American South&rsquo;s lifestyle of brining in or letting in massive non-white populations into white society has gone global and I think this trend of Asian politicians will spread.  Add on to the fact that foreign companies can now donate money to American political campaigns anonymously because of the Citizens United decision and it&rsquo;s all but assured.</p>

		<p>I would rather vote for a conservative, assimilated Indian than a militant self-hating white liberal put up by the Democrats. Ms. Haley is a light-skinned Indian, her IQ is comparable to that of mainstream America. The fact that Indians are celebrating her victory is not surprising. If a politician of Greek or Croatian or whatever descent won an election, I would fully expect Greeks/Croatians/etc. to celebrate.</p>
<p>That said, there are some groups that cannot assimilate to American culture - ever. I would not vote for someone of one of those groups no matter how conservative or libertarian their agenda seemed to be.</p>
<p>#1 - Not to take anything away from the victorious Senator, but Jim DeMint&rsquo;s wide margin of victory is due at least in part to his opponent&rsquo;s quality (lack thereof). LOL.</p>

		<p>A certain number of upper-caste high IQ Indians like Nikki Haley, who immigrate here, adopt our way of thinking (become GOP), and even convert to Christianity, promise to be less of a problem than a mass of unassimilable aliens. But, they are very much an exception.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s more to this story. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the anchor baby-cum-governor in the title of this article, but I do know that Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, was born to illegal Indian immigrants - LSU graduate students who had overstayed their visas. </p>
<p>Could it be that this Nikki Haley character is also an anchor baby born to illegals? </p>
<p>The craziness reached a peak after Obama&rsquo;s first State of the Union address - the Republican reply was delivered by Jindal. So: first the president, a half-African with questionable US citizenship, speaks, then, to answer for the rest of the country, an Indian anchor baby born to illegals makes the retort. </p>
<p>Then and there we made it clear to the rest of the world: The minorities are in charge.  </p>

<p>Sonia Gandhi is an Italian immigrant and president of the ruling Indian National Congress. </p>
<p>According to Wikipedia &#8220;Gandhi&rsquo;s foreign birth has sparked intense debate and opposition&hellip;.</p>
<p>Early in her leadership, there was even criticism from within the Congress Party. In May 1999, three senior leaders of the party (Sharad Pawar, Purno A. Sangma, and Tariq Anwar) challenged her right to try to become India&rsquo;s Prime Minister because of her foreign origins. In response, she offered to resign as party leader, resulting in an outpouring of support and the expulsion from the party of the three rebels.&#8221;</p>

It&rsquo;s not about color but rather features. Actually she really isn&rsquo;t that dark.</p>

<p>  Sorry, one well known female immigrant, married into India&rsquo;s most famous family, does not indicate the same level of acceptance that hundreds of thousands of South Asians receive here in &#8220;racist&#8221; America. Now, how many American whites are allowed to immigrate to India?</p>

		<p>To answer #12 above, I didn&rsquo;t say it was good for America, however, I do think it is good for America because she is a conservative with strong values. I don&rsquo;t care what color or ethnic background she is just so she has strong conservative values.  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think its &#8220;good&#8221;. I certainly don&rsquo;t think its &#8220;good&rsquo; for Whites in America. You say India should be proud of her, but I am not at all interested in India or Indians. Why should Americans feel &#8220;proud&#8221;? That is the question you unwittingly raise. I would also mention that for every immigrant-assimilation &#8216;success&rsquo; story there are several failures (look at the London subway bombers). And even the &#8216;success&rsquo; means the displacement of an American.</p>

		<p>Does anyone remember &#8216;Grey Owl&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Shortly after World War 1, an Englishman named Archie Belaney reinvented himself as an American tribal Indian. He adopted the clothes and the lifestyle, and passed himself off as aboriginal.</p>
<p>This is what East Indians are doing - adopting our language, clothing, culture, and names (Nikki Haley?)to pass themselves off as Western. </p>
<p>Amren is a forum to discuss the future prospects of the white race, of which the Asian Sikh Nimrata Randhawa is not a part of.</p>
<p>The ruling caste of India are among the lightest skinned.  They may be more related to Persians, as some have suggested, but not to white Europeans.<br>
 <br>
Archie Belaney didn&rsquo;t seek fame or fortune with his &#8216;Grey Owl&rsquo; shtick, but I can&rsquo;t say the same for Nimrata Randhawa and her name-change act.  I see racial fraud. </p>

		<p>I think #19 &amp; 20 above have psychological difficulties with the Nikki situation. You two are anti-Nikki because she is of Indian descent even though she is an American.  Talk about being racist.  If she is the best person for the job, then she should have it.  Obviously, she is where she is because she out polled others (including whites) along the way.  So what?</p>
<p>First of all she is an American citizen.  Second, who says she was given everything?,  3. &#8220;They have no business being in our country&#8221; - she didn&rsquo;t sneak in, she is here legally,  4.  She was not &#8220;given&#8221; a government position, she won a hard fought battle to be governor with many whites voting for her.</p>
<p>As for #20 above, I don&rsquo;t care who is proud of her and who isn&rsquo;t - that&rsquo;s up to each individual to decide.  Personally, I like a person who has everything going against them with little chance to succeed, and then finds a way to overcome difficulties and achieve success.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, this represents the &#8220;American way.&#8221;  You say that for every success story there are several failures.  Again this is the American way - 90% of my life is a failure, the 10% success I&rsquo;ve had has allowed me to become wealthy and travel the world and have an absolutely great life.  The important thing is for a person to try, to set goals and to give 100% effort to achieve them.  She did this.  I think it is nice that Indians are proud of her, had a dog won, I would think it is nice that all dogs would be proud. Her winning is not important for whites one way or the other, perhaps her accomplishments will instill others with the spirit to win, including whites and non-whites alike.<br>

<p> Being a &#8220;conservative with strong values&#8221;, is NO reason to elect ANY nonwhite. So you will sell out just because of that? There are WHITES that also have good moral character. Don&rsquo;t you know that in the end ALL other races will stand by and defend their own?  Just because we have White traitors in our government does not mean I will ever vote for a nonwhite!  Get out the White traitors and replace them with decent, good White men!  There are some you know.</p>

<p>DeMint would have beaten just about any Democrat by just about the same margin he did.  Notice that Alvin Greene got 28% of the vote, and he was able to get that much for the same reason he won the primary to begin with.  One who can&rsquo;t figure out the reason for both ought to check him or her self into the funny farm.  Because the answer is obvious.</p>
<p>Mark me   &mdash;   With DeMint getting 12% more of the vote than Nimrata Randhawa, you know that 12% didn&rsquo;t vote for her because they (sensibly) didn&rsquo;t want a non-white Governor.  As far as that goes, hooray for SC.</p>

<p> &#8220;American citizen&#8221;? SO WHAT?  That piece of paper has no meaning whatsoever when the traitors (that issued that worthless piece of paper) allowed any and every 3rd world person to become a &#8220;citizen&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s behind if she is &#8220;legal&#8221;. She shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>BTW, those Whites who voted for her are as naive and as brainwashed as you seem to be. Lord help us!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe you two.  First of all, what I say is not Marxist, it is in fact, Capitalist.  It is the reason America has prospered for centuries.  Marxism, among other things, is government takeover of land and private enterprise which I am totally against.  Marxism is government total control. To me, Obama is a Marxist.  Entreprenurial spirit is what I have always been for.  Freedom is what I am for.</p>
<p>As for #24&rsquo;s comment that I am the reason white America is declining - people call me a racist but I don&rsquo;t come anywhere near you.  I want the best person for the job, if they are white, fine.  If they are green, fine.  You equate this with white America going down the tubes - you are wrong.  What you are saying is that you would vote for a white liberal rather than a black conservative because of the color of their skin - what you might not understand is that it is the liberals (mostly democrats) that have put this country in its present terrible condition.  Liberalism is the enemy, not skin color. </p>
<p>In my way of thinking, it is up to white men to stop becoming like women, educate themselves, have strong moral values, and to dedicate themselves to what is best for the nation. As the Constitution was set up, voting was open only to white men who owned land - I&rsquo;m all for this.  This would end up putting responsible white men in control (if only we had followed the Constitution).</p>
<p>I also believe that 85% of the &#8220;dark skins&#8221; are a total waste of time and effort.  I wish they were not here. They are a drag on this country.  However, there are 15% who are exceptions to the rule and are outstanding citizens - Nikki is one of these, and she won fair and square.  Good for her.    </p>

		<p>Good for her, good for America and good for India. I have no problem with Nikki Haley. She is hot, Americanized, and the mother of a white man&rsquo;s children. Good enough all the way!</p>

		<p>Art from the NC mountains:  I doubt very much that somebody named Art, who lives in the North Carolina mountains, would call anyone a racist, unless of course your black.  And if you are black and think Nikki Haley is good for you and your brothers, you&rsquo;ve got a nasty surprise coming.</p>
<p>And yes, I am a racist.  Thank you for the compliment.</p>

<p>Good Grief! Maybe you need to do a little more research. NO! Inside they are NOT &#8220;white as driven snow&#8221;!  Where are you posters coming from of late? Are you married to one or what?  Whoever said anything about voting for a liberal White to begin with? There are many conservative, good WHITE people to vote for and to suggest that one should vote for an Indian &#8220;conservative&#8221; is just ridiculous. Have you not read all these articles on Amren over the years to understand what is really happening to our country, our race, and our heritage? </p>
<p>Are you one of those who claim to be conservative, yet to conserve is to preserve. Nothing is more important than preserving our own race. I will wager that Nikki feels that way about her countrymen (India) also but will never say it out loud. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The American South now has TWO Indian Governors. Unfortunately, the American South&rsquo;s lifestyle of brining in or letting in massive non-white populations into white society has gone global and I think this trend of Asian politicians will spread. Add on to the fact that foreign companies can now donate money to American political campaigns anonymously because of the Citizens United decision and it&rsquo;s all but assured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow!  Where in the world did you come up with this idea?  I am tired of white Northerners on this website accusing the South of promoting race mixing and diversity.  That is the biggest crock of garbage I have ever heard, myself being a Southerner. </p>
<p>First of all, when you look at the white population of the South, we are more homogenous than any other part of the country.  Second, even when looking at our minority population, we are the most homogenous (we just have particular groups in larger quantities). Third, since when has the South been the most liberal part of the country on the issue of race?</p>
<p>The fact that we have two Indian governors is more of a fluke than anything else.  I never asked for it to happen; that is for sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians are not Black. From my experience, most of them are higher achieving and more conservative than your average brainwashed liberal white. Indians may have dark skin but inside they are white as driven snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>What percentage of Indians are you speaking of exactly?  All billion of them?  Perhaps you need to reword your post.  When you say &#8220;most of them&#8221; I hope you are only speaking of the ones who immigrate to our country which tend to be a biased sampling of Indians anyways.</p>
<p>On another note, since we are on the topic of Indians, I would like to say that the new TV show &#8220;Outsourced&#8221; is one of the worst pieces of brainwashing I have seen on TV in a long while.  </p>
<p>After watching the last few episodes, I have decided I am finished with it for good. I am sick and tired of seeing the attractive young white businessman (the main character) drooling over this Indian woman who works in his office when I personally feel there is nothing about her that is worth the hassle to begin with.  She is &#8220;pretty&#8221; by Indian standards but not pretty according to white standards. I know that there are many beautiful Indian women, but this actress is NOT one of them.  </p>
<p>The fact that this white American businessman is wasting his time being obsessed with an Indian woman who he doesn&rsquo;t even have any &#8220;past&#8221; with, even after she has made it clear that she has to have an arranged marriage, just makes me gag.  I mean,  what white American man would waste his time with that?  It is an insult to me as a white woman that they are showing this attractive white man following (almost stalking) this Indian woman around as if she is worth the hassle.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile there is a stunningly attractive blonde Australian woman character in the TV show who, of course, the producers decided to portray as loose and too easy, constantly throwing herself in front of the white man to get his attention.</p>
<p>What a waste of time.  I would rather watch other shows. This show makes me sick!</p>

<p>Please show where I said I would vote for a White LIBERAL?  No, I said there are plenty of good White men/conservatives etc. in this country. As for your PC rant of calling one a racist, it falls on deaf ears in my case because that is the NEO-con and lefty charge against any racially aware White person. Means absolutely nothing. It just shows your ignorance. </p>
<p>Being a &#8220;racist&#8221; is not a sin but people like you want others to think it is. My ONLY concern is a future and a WHITE future for my children, grandchildren and all White children, in their OWN nation built for them in the first place! What you say is irrevelant.  You can defend Indians, etc all you want, but in the end THEY all have their OWN countries, do they not, and it is ONLY once White nations that do NOT have their own country any longer due to thinking such as yours. </p>

<p>OMG, loosen up for once. The show is a sitcom for crying out loud! I find it incredibly funny, an equal opportunity satire on cultural stereotypes. Amreners need to get a life and develop a sense of humor. As for feminine beauty, opinions are wholly subjective; beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder as the old adage goes&hellip;</p>

<p>You are entitled to your opinion but don&rsquo;t expect it to go unanswered on a website like this.  We are glad you told us how you feel; now most of us don&rsquo;t agree with you&hellip;.sorry.</p>
<p>Just as white men on here get upset over shows and movies etc&hellip;that promote white women hooking up with nonwhite men, now it is my turn to get upset about the opposite scenario.</p>
<p>For you to say that &#8220;it is just a sitcom&hellip;lighten up&#8221;, shows me how little you care about what is happening to our society and to our people in general.</p>
<p>And by the way, I saw your post in its entirety before a moderator got on here and edited it. You understand that personal insults aren&rsquo;t allowed on here right? You know very little about my dating life, so don&rsquo;t even try to guess what it is about.  The lowest way you can insult somebody is by insulting them when you know very little about them.  </p>
<p>But to answer your question from your post before it got edited, NO I have NEVER been turned down for an Asian woman by a white man. In fact most white men I see with Asian women aren&rsquo;t worth my time. I don&rsquo;t have any problem at all attracting white men, but thanks for showing your concern.</p>

		<p>The notion that non-Whites deserve to be empowered over Whites in White homelands just because they made good by studying hard and qualifying, is patently false.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Firstly, it is non-Whites <b>not</b> Whites who have been awarded undeserved privileges via Affirmative Action and quota-mandering in our White homelands on the grounds of race and skin-colour.  (Yes, it <b>is</b> most certainly all about RACE in today&rsquo;s world).</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the White founding ethnicity of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and in the case of Europe and Britain, the indigenous who are being deliberately and overtly squeezed out of advanced educational opportunities and resultant high-profile employment in particular, for the purpose of continually diminishing the flow of White achievers through the System in every White homeland thus enabling a perpetual propagating of concocted Marxist Liberal claims that there aren&rsquo;t enough indigenous Whites to fill the posts and non-Whites being needed to do the jobs native Whites refuse to do, etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>The Indian female who won this election in common with the countless other non-White selectees across the West, is simply another beneficiary of the anti-White Affirmative Action/Quota mandering laws designed to dispossess and disenfranchise the founding peoples of their ancestral territories, identities, birthrights, heritages and cultures which will lead inevitably to total disinheritance of land along with the denial of inalienable rights to ethnic survival and physical prosperity - in short, ENSLAVEMENT and eventual EXTINCTION.</p>
<p>The Tea Party won&rsquo;t be the party to take back America because they are intentionally steering well clear of the most potent driving force in global politics at the present time, ie, RACE which so happens to be the primary component that decides whether or not a nation remains a nation at all.</p>
<p>In America&rsquo;s case and at some juncture in the future, Canada&rsquo;s, Australia&rsquo;s and New Zealand&rsquo;s too, the unavoidable drift towards secession is approaching the horizon, and the US ruling elite know it fine well.<br>
