<h1><i>News</i> Is Reaching Out to East Side Community</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Margaret Sullivan, Buffalo News, November 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Early last month, I spent a memorable  &mdash;  though difficult  &mdash;  evening at True Bethel Baptist Church on East Ferry Street, listening to an outpouring of complaints about The Buffalo News from about 700 East Side residents.</p>
<p>Many of them had come to vent their outrage over a recent News story that detailed the criminal records of the victims of the City Grill tragedy  &mdash;  the Aug. 14 shooting spree that killed four and injured four others. While some agreed that the information itself was newsworthy, almost everyone objected to its timing, coming so soon after the deaths and funerals of loved ones, and to its prominent placement on the Sunday front page.</p>
<p>Many of the speakers expressed raw emotion, bitterness and anger. {snip}</p>
<p>Others spoke of a broader, deeper problem: The News&rsquo; coverage of their community which, they believe, emphasizes crime and gangs, but does not focus on the positive, or help solve the community&rsquo;s very real problems.</p>
<p>I can say, without exaggeration, that I left that meeting both shaken and changed. I still believe The News was right to publish the story because it exposed an important piece of the puzzle about that tragic shooting. But its timing and placement should have been handled more sensitively and more respectfully. (Those decisions were essentially mine.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Soon after the True Bethel meeting, I asked for volunteers in the newsroom to come up with a plan. Dozens of reporters, editors, clerks, photographers and others were quick to respond.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the things that we plan to do:</p>
<p>* Form a diversity advisory council to give us feedback on our coverage of minorities. The group will be made up of community members  &mdash;  some prominent people and some &#8220;ordinary citizens.&#8221; Editors and reporters will meet with the group quarterly. (If you&rsquo;d like to be considered for a role on the council, please write to me or to Rod Watson at The News.)</p>
<p>* Start a speakers&rsquo; bureau to get our reporters and editors out to meet people in the community. {snip}</p>
<p>* Conduct diversity training in the newsroom. {snip}</p>
<p>* Conduct a public opinion poll to gauge perceptions of The News among members of the black community. (This was a particular request of the East Side ministers and activists.)</p>
<p>* Begin a regular, every other week feature in the City&Region; section that highlights positive or constructive news from the East Side, or simply describes neighborhoods and community activities.</p>

<p>This has been my view of how blacks usually react to any sort of perceived slight.  This goofy liberal journalist was lucky to get out of there without being assaulted or worse.   </p>
<p>&#8220;Others spoke of a broader, deeper problem: The News&rsquo; coverage of their community which, they believe, emphasizes crime and gangs, but does not focus on the positive, or help solve the community&rsquo;s very real problems.</p>
<p>As I suspected all along, even though blacks live in the middle of the maelstrom, they do not see the overwhelming crime and gang violence as a real problem.  </p>

<p>This White editor should have gone the whole Bullock and declared that he will either open him own home up to Sec. 8 residents or he will move his family into the black community neighborhood.   Whites should demand one or the other from him, and nothing less.  Or boycott his advertisers for being a pandering Whitey who hosts diversity training at his work.</p>
<p>We demand that he &#8220;atone for the sins of segregation by holding himself accountable to people of color for his unearned White privileges.&#8221;  He must step down from his position of power and let a black have his job NOW!<br>

<p>Too bad I wasn&rsquo;t there. My suggestion would have been that liberal special interest groups get out of the newsroom. But that would likely (and apparently so) end up being 4/5ths of the reporters at the paper. A big city newspaper isn&rsquo;t liberal enough and doesn&rsquo;t focus enough on minority grievance? This is just crazy. There isn&rsquo;t a major city newspaper, out of hundreds, that isn&rsquo;t far-left, outside of one or two very large cities that have two newspapers. They don&rsquo;t pander to blacks at the expense of whites enough already?</p>

First some background.</p>
<p>This summer, there was a mass shooting in a downtown Buffalo bar called The City Grill. Eight people were shot, four died. Estimates of the crowd are as high as 200 but there are no witnesses.</p>
<p>About a week after this event, The Buffalo News reported this article:</p>
<p><b>7 of 8 shooting victims had criminal past</b></p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2994mk3</p>
<p>This article gave blacks what they wanted; a distraction. &lsquo;This isn&rsquo;t about our dysfunction and pathology, it&rsquo;s about racism in Buffalo and at the Buffalo News&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Blacks went ballistic and they forced the editor of the Buffalo News, Margaret Sullivan, to attend a public meeting so they could vent their outrage:</p>
<p><b>Black community voices outrage over story on City Grill victims</b></p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2awydsx" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2awydsx</a></p>
<p>This new set of minority-pandering initiatives is shameful. News will now be filtered, scrubbed, and sanitized to protect the black &lsquo;east side&rsquo; from being viewed as it truly is; as are the majority of black communities around the US and across the world.</p>
<p>But they can&rsquo;t hide the truth no matter how much they try. Even without the Buffalo News people talk and people know what&rsquo;s going on where.</p>
<p>The Buffalo News can try to make the news black-friendly but black news is old news and everyone already knows how the story begins and ends.<br>
 <br>
As Bob Dylan said, &#8216;you don&rsquo;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>Sounds as if the writer, assuming she&rsquo;s white, is a product of a sheltered upbringing, otherwise why would all this be surprising to her? I sure wish people like her would quit using bogus euphemisms like &#8220;community&#8221; when discussing blacks. My advice would be to print it if it&rsquo;s true; it would have a liberating effect. The truth, it&rsquo;s said, sets one free. </p>

		<p>The Buffalo News is an unapologetic leftist rag who refuses to cover the true condition of Buffalo and its black affliction.  Margaret Sullivan, the editor, who is an extreme ideologue, has driven ciruculation into the ground with recent lay-offs with more to come.  Here is one glaring example of the Buffalo News&rsquo; racial bias:<br>
 <br>
In November 2007, Darnell Prude, a black man, was indicted for committing a series of home invasions, robberies and vicious beatings around the Broadway Market area of Buffalo&rsquo;s east side.  The Buffalo News reports the victims of these crimes as &#8220;elderly,&#8221; conveniently omitting the fact that all the victims were Caucasian.  If the story involved a white predator exclusively targeting black victims, it would be a huge story with hate-crime intonations.  It would fit nicely into the pervasive politically correct agenda.  Is it merely a coincidence that all the victims targeted were elderly white folks?  One can only guess at the reason for this glaring double-standard in news reporting.</p>
<p>The east side of Buffalo used to be a nice Polish white neighborhood.  That changed seriously in the 60&rsquo;s when the blacks moved in full-force and white flight manifested itself.  The only remaining white persons on the east side are elderly Polish persons in their 70s, 80s and 90&rsquo;s.  The police refused to report that elderly white folks were being viciously beaten and killed in obviously racially motivated violence.  None of Mr. Prude&rsquo;s victims were black, only white.  The Buffalo News notoriously was complicit in this violence by not reporting the facts.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see why that wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough. If blacks were unhappy with negative coverage of their neighborhood, then countering it with more positive coverage is the natural thing to do. But as usual, whites have to dramatically overcompensate for any perceived slights.</p>
<p>The big difference between whites and blacks is that blacks complain when they don&rsquo;t feel their interests are being represented and whites don&rsquo;t. Whites have been so cowed into submission and self-guilt and loathing that they suffer all manner of indignities, including giving up their inborn right of free association, without a whimper. </p>
<p>So who is to blame for that?</p>

<p>This story was covered here months ago. 700 Black people marched on the paper, demanding that they edit and censor coverage of the Black people in the city. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s so profoundly stupid. You can start 100 &#8220;diversity&#8221; panels - it won&rsquo;t change the gang activity and outrageous crime rate and murder among blacks in Buffalo. This is so typical of the idiots on both sides of the issue. </p>
<p>You have the aggrieved &#8220;residents&#8221; (blacks) of the &#8220;community&#8221; (ghetto) who manage to show up to complain about the newspaper&rsquo;s reporting of the truth as if that will change things. Why aren&rsquo;t these same people, instead, working to change the culture of what caused the events that lead to the reporting in the first place? </p>
<p>Then you have the newspaper people (liberal clown-cowards) in essence apologizing for covering a story because some readers (I suspect few are black anyway) do not want to read the truth.</p>
<p>And newspapers wonder why circulation is imploding.</p>

		<p>Talking of Polish and Black: this excerpt from a Martin Amis  novel. &#8216;Einsteinn&rsquo;s Monsters&rsquo;. Refreshing stuff indeed.  </p>
<p>It was 1980, the birth year of Solidarity, and Bujak was Polish. This combination of circumstances led me to assume that Bujak was liberal in his sentiments. Actually it didn&rsquo;t follow. As I proudly strolled with him to the timber yard or the home-improvement stores off the Portobello Road, Bujak would fume against the blacks, the czarnuchy, as they strutted and gabbled round about us. The blacks were fine, he grinningly argued, in a context of sun, surf, and plentiful bananas; but in a Western city they were just children &mdash;  understandably angry children.</p>
<p>Having lived in this particular &#8216;carnival&rsquo; area of west London,  Amis  is obviously writing from a life experience.  </p>
<p>The time he caught two black kids prying at a neighbor&rsquo;s basement window and sent them twirling into the street with two flicks of his wrist, like someone mucking out a trench. Or what he did to their big brothers when they jumped him in Golbourne Road the following night. Any brawler or burglar nabbed by Bujak soon wished himself under the hosepipe in some nice safe slammer. </p>
<p>Martim Amis often parodies  what his critics call the &#8216;racial threat&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s also said The Muslim community  need to be shaken down from time to  time and if it&rsquo;s felt any are not  playing the game, then deport them and their families. <br>

This is actually the SECOND concession to blacks by the Buffalo News.</p>
<p>Like all websites, the Buffalo News had a posting section where you could post comments using a screen name. It also had rules about using certain words and not saying anything offensive. (The problem with a vague rule like that is that one man&rsquo;s offensive remark is another man&rsquo;s statement of facts).</p>
<p>Most people abided by the rules. &#8220;Offensive&#8221; comments could be reported as &#8220;abuse&#8221; (This is another badly executed rule since anyone can report any comment as &#8220;abuse&#8221; and eventually the &#8220;abuser&#8221; gets banned without being able to defend themselves).</p>
<p>Even with these rules in place, the Buffalo News couldn&rsquo;t control the discussion. I never used banned words and kept my comments respectful but truthful citing published statistics on crime and educational failure. Although I followed the rules, I was eventually banned.</p>
<p>Since the Buffalo News couldn&rsquo;t stop anonymous &lsquo;hate speech&rsquo;, they decided to &lsquo;expose&rsquo; the &lsquo;haters&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Since August 2010, the Buffalo News has required that individuals fill out a form with their real name, home address, and home contact. There is no anonymous screen name posting anymore. Before you can post, you have to submit all your information and it must be confirmed by the Buffalo News staff before you&rsquo;re allowed to post. When you post, your full name and home town appear with your comments.</p>
<p>Comments have fallen off dramatically. A story that would have had 100 comments is lucky to get one.</p>
<p>The Buffalo News reported that 200 people had signed up and Margaret Sullivan seemed surprised and confused by the low number. Half the people who now post are posting from out of state.</p>
<p>The only people who now post are people who agree with the policy and editorial leftist-bent of the Buffalo News. There is little dissent and no discussion.</p>
<p>Of course, filtering the news about black pathology hasn&rsquo;t done anything to solve any problem. As of Nov., we&rsquo;re up to our 50th homicide which are overwhelmingly black. 50 to 60 is average so we&rsquo;re right on target for black on black homicides this year. But we can all take comfort that the Buffalo News doesn&rsquo;t permit &#8216;hate&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Like some other commenters I am a Buffalo area native and am familiar with the background of this story. The simple truth is that a large group of blacks had a wedding party and violence escalated to gunfire. This is not a surprise nor is the fact that most of the victims had criminal records. Happens every day in black &#8220;communities&#8221; this just resulted in higher casualties. The paper reported the criminal backgrounds and was called racist. As always the truth hurts the blacks. Maybe they should look in the mirror, see the sorry truth and clean up their act instead of crying racist.</p>

		<p>yankee rebel - you&rsquo;re right.  They should clean up their act rather than scream racist every time the ugly truth of their behavior confronts them.  But they won&rsquo;t.  Not until WHITES grow a backbone and tell them that very thing every time they scream racist at ugly truths about themselves - such as their behavior in large groups, their elevated crime, their men abandoning their children, their women acting like sluts and having five children or more by five different men, their incarceration rate, the fact that their crimes are always gratuitously more horrific, etc.  Until Whites universally respond to cries of racism with &#8220;clean up your dam*  act and stop using the lame false accusation of racism&#8221; we will continue to hear them blame their behavior on that excuse.  The cowardly white editor should have simply told them &#8220;I printed the truth.  You don&rsquo;t like it, tough. You seem more upset about the truth being printed than you are about a wedding turning into the gunfight at the OK corral.  What a sorry lot you are&#8221;.  </p>

<p>Since when does a newspaper have a responsibility to &#8220;help solve&#8221; a community&rsquo;s problems? Journalists aren&rsquo;t social workers. They don&rsquo;t have any obligation to &#8220;focus on the positive.&#8221; The fact that this editor caved in to these infantile demands just proves that she has no journalistic integrity at all. </p>

		<p>Buffalo is among the last cities in the US with communities full of whites with ethnic pride that will openly admit they want nothing to do with blacks, and will intimidate blacks if they are in their white enclave and let them know there is no welcome mat. Buffalo East side is full of criminal blacks and the West side is full of slightly less criminal Puerto Ricans, and everybody with a brain that lives there knows where the violence originates, and it&rsquo;s not in Amherst.  </p>

<p>Wait - why didn&rsquo;t they ask the True Bethel meeting blacks to come up with the plan?  Why are a bunch of <b>white reporters</b> responsible for designing a &#8220;plan&#8221; for blacks?  Isn&rsquo;t that racist?</p>
<p>Blacks love to have their complaint parties and marches, but just ask them to &#8220;come up with a plan&#8221; and watch the dumbfounded silence.  Blacks are not even held responsible for thinking through <i>their own complaints</i>!  </p>
<p>Pathetic on both sides.  <br>

<p>Thanks for this information - I noticed that this article had only 2 comments, both from extreme liberals.  That explains it.  </p>
<p>There can be no free press or balanced reporting in a western country that is &#8220;diversifying&#8221;.  Europe is shutting down all honest commentary on &#8220;sensitive&#8221; racial topics, and we&rsquo;re close behind.  Good bye, America!  <br>

		<p>To yankee rebel (re post # 18):</p>
<p>&#8216;As always, the truth hurts the blacks&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Does it ever, paisan! Re the recent Oakland shootings at a Halloween party, I posted how Bantus are always slient if Jamarcus Washington is shot and killed by Willie Kasavubu, but froth at the mouth if a Bantu is killed by someone of another race. I was castigated and called a &#8220;racist&#8221;, but I didn&rsquo;t apologize. Most Bantus tolerate black-on-black crime, preferring to blame guns or &#8220;lack of opportunity&#8221;, or whitey. But if a white, Hispanic or Oriental shoots a Bantu, then the city burns.</p>

		<p><i>The big difference between whites and blacks is that blacks complain when they don&rsquo;t feel their interests are being represented and whites don&rsquo;t. <br>
  <br>
Whites have been so cowed into submission and self-guilt and loathing that they suffer all manner of indignities, including giving up their inborn right of free association, without a whimper.<br>
 <br>
So who is to blame for that?</i><br>

<p>__  __  __  __  __  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question that deserves pondering!   And while the answer might seem superficially obvious, I would suggest it is not a simple one. It takes some studying.</p>
<p>(Hint: Whites didn&rsquo;t cow themselves into submission and self-guilt. None of thie white guilt mania that has gripped all white countries has happened by accident.)</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;I can say, without exaggeration, that I left that meeting both shaken and changed&hellip;.<br>

<p><br>
That amounts to saying that you accepted the blame and held the newspaper responsible for printing unflattering news.  </p>
<p>Since when is it the responsibility of a newspaper to report only good news and happy talk?</p>
<p>And why do blacks always rant and complain, while whites apologize and grovel?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you tell them  bluntly that, as adults, they should be responsible for themselves; and if the news from their community isn&rsquo;t good news, it&rsquo;s up to them to improve it. </p>
<p>And why, as Jill said above, should it be up to YOU to come up with a &#8220;plan&#8221; to make the black news look better?  You ought to have told them that you just print the truth, whatever it is,  and cleaning up the news coming from the black community is fundamentally THEIR job, not yours.</p>
