<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-africa/20101114/AF.Guinea.Election/">Guinea: State of Emergency After Post-poll Riots</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rukmini Callimachi, Comcast News, Nov. 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Guinea&rsquo;s military on Wednesday declared a state of emergency following violence after a tense presidential election.</p>
<p>Armed forces chief Nouhou Thiam read the decree Wednesday on state television. The decree prohibits civilians from circulating on the streets, he said, but did not give further details. Only military and security forces will have unrestricted movement, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decree will hold until the Supreme Court declares final results from the Nov. 7 poll. They have eight days to do so after results were announced late Monday, allowing a decision by next week.</p>
<p>Presidential candidate Alpha Conde, a Malinke, was declared winner in the runoff, prompting Peul supporters of his opponent Cellou Dalein Diallo to riot. They burned tires, barricaded roads and destroyed the homes and businesses of Malinke neighbors.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, some members of Guinea&rsquo;s Malinke ethnic group said they armed themselves for possible clashes with their Peul neighbors. Groups of men lining the road from the capital Conakry to the downtrodden suburbs shouted to cars passing by, shaking sticks, guns and machetes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are here to protect ourselves. We have knives .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and sticks,&#8221; said Mohamed Camara, who is Malinke.</p>
<p>The mostly Malinke security force in Guinea has taken over troubled neighborhoods which now look like ghost towns. Bullet casings and the smoldering, burned tires litter the road. Few residents venture outside. Reports of police brutality against Peul citizens are multiplying and at least four people have been killed and 62 injured since results were announced Monday night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ethnic tension has already sparked clashes in neighboring Sierra Leone, where police said Wednesday that Peul and Malinke members had clashed a day earlier. Assistant Inspector General of Police Sorie Kargbo said 20 people were arrested in Sierra Leone&rsquo;s town of Kenema for rioting. He said the dispute was between Peul and Malinke.</p>
<p>Guinea borders Sierra Leone and Liberia, nations recovering from wars fueled by ethnic divisions. For decades Guinea was a counterpoint to these two nations, with Peul and Malinke not only living side-by-side but also frequently intermarrying.<br>

		<p>Is it me or does this seem to happen every time there is a vote in some African country? This whole sorry episode is made worse because it doesn&rsquo;t matter who wins because, seriously, Jeffersonian democracy is not waiting in the wings. And I suspect no one is counting the ballots either. </p>
<p>Black rule means the winning side gets better access to the guns and UN money but that&rsquo;s about it. And I don&rsquo;t think the new administration is talking about infrastructure enhancement right now.</p>
<p>My favorite line is, &#8220;Presidential candidate Alpha Conde, a Malinke, was declared winner in the runoff, prompting Peul supporters of his opponent Cellou Dalein Diallo to riot.&#8221; I guess they&rsquo;re not big on concession speeches in Guinea.</p>
<p>And can anyone tell me why we keep sending money to that continent?</p>

		<p>Want to make book on how long the &#8220;winner&#8221; of this election will stay in power? I&rsquo;d say a matter of months, since the military is already showing its teeth and flexing its muscle.</p>
<p>Guinea, of course, is 100% coal-black, but they STILL have tribal conflicts. At least they&rsquo;re not blaming the conflicts on France or French colonialism - yet.</p>

<p>This is democracy in action African style.  The same thing would happen more often here if the blacks weren&rsquo;t kept in check somewhat by the police.</p>
<p>In a riot, what blacks concentrate on is burning down their own neighborhoods, so they won&rsquo;t have any stores to shop at.  And an NAACP exec was on T.V. the other night complaining that &#8220;racists&#8221; were saying blacks weren&rsquo;t as smart as whites.</p>
<p>(He really did.)</p>

		<p>I am shocked!  Who ever would have known that when different ethnic groups are forced to live together in the same place that it would lead to conflict?</p>

		<p>Arvind Patel, AP News, November 6, 2012:</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s military on Wednesday declared a state of emergency following violence after a tense presidential election.</p>
<p>Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a Mormon, was declared winner in the runoff, prompting African-American supporters of his opponent Barack Obama to riot. They burned tires, barricaded roads and destroyed the homes and businesses of European-American neighbors.</p>
<p>The mostly European-American security force in America has taken over troubled neighborhoods which now look like ghost towns. Bullet casings and the smoldering, burned tires litter the road. Few residents venture outside. Reports of police brutality against European-American citizens are multiplying and at least four people have been killed and 62 injured since results were announced Monday night.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think it couldn&rsquo;t happen here?</p>

		<p>It sounds like an old fashioned Irish funeral at my house right now. The keening and wailing is deafening. My whole family was deeply upset by the news that Africans might be about to harm each other again. </p>

I say &hellip;.</p>
<p>Have more than thou showest,<br>
Speak less than thou knowest,<br>
Lend less than thou owest,<br>
Ride more than thou goest,<br>
Learn more than thou trowest,<br>
Set less than thou throwest;<br>
Leave thy drink and thy whore,<br>
And keep in-a-door,<br>
And thou shall have more<br>
Than two tens to a score.<br>

		<p>Why is it that Africans love burning tires? I mean really, when there are so many things you could set on fire, why do they always seem to choose tires? I would have thought they&rsquo;d run out of them by now.</p>

<p>Because that&rsquo;s what the Congressional Black Caucus (and its White do-gooder cheerleaders) wants.  An endless stream of White taxpayer dollars will civilize the poor, downtrodden Africans and make African society a shining beacon of achievement.  Any day now.  Soon.  Honest.<br>

		<p>What?  Guinea has no whites, so what&rsquo;s the problem there? </p>
<p>I thought that when everyone is black there would at last be peace, love, and harmony in the world!</p>

		<p>I knew one of the many offspring of the first Nigerian democratically elected president, Moshood Abiola. He was murdered (poisoned) about a year after his election. I believe the story was that he was found, face down in some food, with prostitutes surrounding him, despite the fact that he had 12 wives, and 100&rsquo;s of children. Most of the children attended European and American private schools and universities. </p>
<p>The family (and my friend) had to evacuate. </p>
