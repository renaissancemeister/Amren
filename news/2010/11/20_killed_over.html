<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40057847/ns/world_news-americas/">20 Killed Over Weekend In Mexican Border City</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Olivia Torres, MSNBC, November 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 20 people were killed in drug-gang violence over the weekend in this northern Mexican border city, including seven found dead outside one house.</p>
<p>The seven men were believed to have been at a family party when they were gunned down Saturday night, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the attorney general&rsquo;s office in Chihuahua state, where Ciudad Juarez is located. Five were found dead in a car, and the other two were shot at the entrance of the home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Few residents now venture out to bars and restaurants. And like those attacked on Saturday, others have discovered that they aren&rsquo;t even safe in their own homes: Last month, gunmen stormed two neighboring houses and massacred more than a dozen young people attending a party for a 15-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, has become one of the world&rsquo;s deadliest cities in the time that the two cartels have been fighting. More than 6,500 people have been killed since the start of 2008.</p>
<p>But the violence doesn&rsquo;t stop there. In the southern city of Oaxaca, police found a human head in a gift-wrapped box left Saturday night on the side of a cliff popular for its view of the picturesque colonial center.</p>
<p>Reporters at the scene saw a threatening message left with the head signed, &#8220;the last letter Z,&#8221; an apparent reference to the Zetas drug gang.</p>

		<p>The cartels are growing economically, militarily and in political power, three vital requirements for taking over a nation.</p>
<p>Unless drugs are legalized the cartels will eventually take over Mexico and will have infiltrated the US geographically and politically to a great extent.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical that relaxing our drug laws will alleviate this problem.  A more sensible solution would be to seal the border with Mexico, and close all foreign US military installations.  US troops would then be re-deployed at 50-yard intervals along the Mexican border.  </p>

		<p>These are the people George W. Bush strived might and main to &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; in America, people whom he never tired to lecture us had &#8216;good American family values&rsquo;.<br>
 Luckily a popular uprising stopped Bush&rsquo;s madness.</p>

 Although the Hispanic population of El Paso, Texas is 80 percent, it has the third lowest crime rates of any large American city.<br>

		<p>Well, the US did want a war on drugs. And now it has one. We can blame the violence on any number of things. But what is interesting is how US policy never changes. It is always &#8220;more of the same,&#8221; no matter how much these policies fail. </p>
<p>(One thing I find interesting is the number of people on race realist websites who support a libertarian approach in ending the drug war. This ought to give the lie to the claim that race realists are mainly &#8220;nazis.&#8221; Instead, we see a considerable amount of anti-authoritarian sentiment on AR. One suspects that the concept of liberty is very much tied in to white culture. Certainly we can see the repression that comes out of PC dominated countries, with their &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws and such.) </p>

<p>When Al Qaeda does a beheading or three over in the Middle East, the USA sees it as a reason to march armies into Mesopotamia and the Hindu Kush. But we have a situation south of the Rio Grande which is becoming an insurgency and no attempt is made to seal the frontier. Again, it gets back to the bizarre and disjointed policies of the US government. The situation borders on surreal.</p>
<p>To a rational observer, it might appear that the folks in DC are on drugs. </p>

<p>Maybe you and your guys should be HERE AT HOME looking after OUR OWN BORDERS, instead of being on a fool&rsquo;s errand in Afghanistan. </p>

		<p>Actually El Paso is more like 85-90% hispanic at this point if you looked at previous demographic momentum from prior censes. (It should be noted that as of the 1960 census El Paso was only 34% hispanic).</p>
<p>The big reason the crime is at least officially low is: 1.  drug cartels like a safe haven for families nearby 2.  A large federal presence due to Border Patrol and Ft. Bliss 3. El Paso deployed a highly effective gang unit that neutralized most gangs which became so effective they dismantled it a couple years ago.  Too bad gang violence has been rising again recently at the WRONG TIME.  </p>
