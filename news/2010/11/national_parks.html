<h1>National Parks Have Room for All Races</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shelton Johnson, CNN, October 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the only African American permanent ranger in Yosemite National Park in California, I often lament that I&rsquo;m more likely to meet visitors from Japan or France than I am to see an African-American family from nearby Sacramento or Oakland. So I couldn&rsquo;t be more appreciative of my recent opportunity to lead Oprah Winfrey through this national treasure for a two-part television special that airs Friday and Monday.</p>
<p>Some readers may be stunned to learn that this well-traveled celebrity had never before visited a national park. Most people of color won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>When I was growing up in Detroit, Michigan, in the 1960s, no one in my family ever visited a national park, nor to my knowledge did anyone in my community. My school friends never talked about summer vacations to Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon. The Smokey Mountains and Mesa Verde never came up in class discussions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Back in Detroit, my grandfather had an old tackle box in our basement and stories about fishing on Mackinac Island. Together we&rsquo;d watch National Geographic specials and &#8220;Wild Kingdom,&#8221; and I was drawn to landscapes that bore so little resemblance to the scenes outside our front door. Half African and half Cherokee, my grandfather understood and encouraged the attraction.</p>
<p>When I became a Yosemite park ranger in December of 1993, I didn&rsquo;t know that I was in a preserve that had once been protected by Buffalo Soldiers, African-American men serving with the Ninth Cavalry. Eventually, I saw that history as a bridge between my culture and the National Park idea.</p>
<p>I began to dress as a Buffalo Soldier and to tell this historical story to people who visited the park. Unfortunately, few of those people were African-American. {snip}</p>

		<p>There are quite a few beaches I won&rsquo;t go to because the population there is now &#8216;diverse&rsquo;. Not so when I was a kid and beaches were safe, magical places. The national parks and the innocent creatures living there do not need any brothers pissing in the bushes, shooting creatures or people with Glocks, playing loud music, and hustling and raping white women. Let alone holding up vacationing families. Sorry. That&rsquo;s what they do. And I really don&rsquo;t care what their family income is.</p>

		<p>Blacks seem to love the accoutrements of civilization (witness their love of cell phones), NOT the wilderness. And yet their behavior ultimately leads to the demise of civilization (witness Devil&rsquo;s Night in Detroit).</p>

		<p>Blacks are always trying to get in touch with their special blackness. Why not a campaign to help troubled white youth get out of the city and into the campground? Taking a cue from the other races and the &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; people, they should celebrate the presence of a lot of whites. Is their a program they can say no to? It would be just the celebration white youth could be proud of, a celebration of a lot of whites. Goodness knows they could use it. </p>

		<p>I started to watch this on Oprah and turned it immediately. I rarely watch Oprah or any of the other afternoon shows on TV. I pray that blacks never start visiting Yosemite or any other parks we have. As for them camping out in the parks, heaven help us if they decide they need to experience the big outdoors!  That goes for Mexicans also. I can remember as a kid my family would camp out in the Yosemite and General Grant and we had so much fun and no problems whatsoever with the other campers. Could be because they were all WHITE. I shudder now to even think what would happen if blacks or mexcians had of been among the other campers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know that I was in a preserve that had once been protected by Buffalo Soldiers, African-American men serving with the Ninth Cavalry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wonder if we can verify that fact? Is it something like Glen Beck and his infamous &#8220;Black Founding Fathers&#8221;?   </p>

		<p>Blacks like to point out that they are &#8220;part Indian&#8221;. Like this one says that his grand dad was half Cherokee. It&rsquo;s fashionable in black community to be less African. Just look at who the prominent American blacks are. They are all mulattoes. With the notable exception of Michael King(aka MLK). </p>

		<p>The narrator of this story sounds like a nice enough fellow.  God knows we need more black people in touch with nature.  Nature has a way of civilizing people.  Plenty of white people are losing touch with nature and that&rsquo;s a tragedy.</p>
<p>What he says is true.  I have never in my life seen a black person or family in any kind of rugged or even semi-rugged locality.  You&rsquo;re unlikely to see any at any park unless there&rsquo;s a basketball court.</p>
<p>Where I live the latinos have taken over the parks.  They love to BBQ and leave trash by the tons.  Any open spot becomes a soccer field.  If you enter the parks, the latinos around here glare at you until you leave.</p>

<p>Most blacks aren&rsquo;t going to be interested in nature simply because there&rsquo;s nothing in it for them.</p>
<p>Offer them free barbecue and maybe a few will show up but I don&rsquo;t see blacks being drawn to the peace and quite, intrinsic magnificences, and serenity of the natural world. </p>
<p>Go to any public park and you will find blacks with their ghetto blasters sharing their intrusive, disruptive &#8220;culture&#8221; with white people who are trying to escape such intrusions.<br>

<p>Right. Oprah would travel to South Africa and visit the national parks there, but not here. Oprah would go ANYWHERE in the world and rave about the beauty of the place but would not do so here in the U.S.</p>
<p>The National Parks are seen as a &#8220;whitey&#8221; thing and therefor are uncool. NOT for US. NOT FUBU.</p>

		<p>Buffalo Soldiers, one of my favorite points of hypocrisy.  Here we have an African-American so proud of his heritage that he dresses in time-period fashion to speak to visitors. I wonder if he mentions that some Buffalo Soldiers were freed Blacks who, once freed from the bondage of the White Man almost immediately joined the White Man in the killing and removal of the Red Man from the American West?  Something tells me he does not.  And if he does, I wonder if he displays contrition?  And if contrite, I wonder if he plans to petition all blacks to move to Africa and thus off of the land once posessed by Indians. For if he does not, then hipocrisy reigns. It is no longer valid for Blacks to decry the evil White Man for taking land away from the Indian when the Black Man, now free, lives on land they could return. As for White folks who may feel guilty as well, that&rsquo;s fine, but if you do not return to Europe then do you not display the same hipocrisy?  The contest was between tribes of differing race and culture for the dominance over land; The European tribe won out and the Indian tribes were defeated. Our ancestors fought to expand the area controlled by our tribe in order to gain greater security for tribal survivability. I for one take pride in their efforts. The question I have for Black Americans is this: Are you proud of the efforts of the Buffalo Soldiers? If so, are you not then proud of the efforts of America? As always, I welcome comments or criticism of my analysis.</p>

		<p>  The bruthas will never go camping in the wilderness. They are afraid of the darkness,wild animals, plus the hardships and work required when you go camping. Also there is an uncertainty of the supply of crack and other goodies.</p>

		<p>Blacks just plain don&rsquo;t like camping. If you are on friendly enough terms with one, and pin them down on why, they will usually mumble something about the danger of being &#8220;eaten by bears&#8221; or some such nonsense. They just don&rsquo;t have the genetic makeup to appreciate and enjoy it. That&rsquo;s fine by me, less of them to have to deal with while camping or backpacking in remote wilderness areas.</p>

		<p>Stop and think about what &#8220;going camping&#8221; means. In essence it means uprooting yourself from familiar circumstances and experimenting with an entirely new way of doing things. The ghetto has known rules and everyone there knows the rules. Remove people from their comfort zone and they are forced to think for themselves and that scares ghettoites. &#8220;Bears&#8221; is simply the name they put on their own fears. Can&rsquo;t have Leroy say &#8220;I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be able to sleep on the ground&#8221;, better to go with the bears. Showing fear in the ghetto is an invitation for diaster. Ghetto folks know that and look for excuses that are more palatable.  </p>

		<p>The ONLY way blacks will ever go camping is if WHITES (1) provide, and put up, their tents for them (2) provide the food and cook it, after gathering the wood and building the fire (3) build basketball courts in every national park (4) designate an area wherein they can sell and buy drugs, working hard to make sure each dealer has his own territory (5) remove all wildlife - blacks are purely scared of any wildlife from bunnies to bears (6) once they leave, IF they leave, pick up after them.  In other words, only when we move the welfare advantages into the wilderness while removing the wilderness FROM the wilderness will they visit.</p>

		<p>Judging from the horrendously loud conversations they have and the way they blast the aweful music they listen to, I think it is safe to say that the very last thing most blacks want is the peace and quiet of a national park.  Doubtless if they could be encouraged to go to national parks, they would bring this behavior with them.  I imagine white and Japanese nature-lovers would find someplace else to go.</p>

<p>Understandably. The only history blacks know or care anything about is slavery. That part benefits them - they don&rsquo;t exactly know how or why, but slavery helps them big time.</p>

		<p>To Jeddermann (re post # 12):</p>
<p>I suspect that Winfrey would rather go visit parks and stores in other countries, because the USA would be a painful reminder of which country it was, that brought her ancestors aboard that slave ship.</p>
<p>Even though she made her billions in this country, she and all American Bantus have NEVER lost that &#8220;slave mentality&#8221; feeling. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money is in their pockets or what kind of homes they live in, they STILL feel they&rsquo;re slaves. They&rsquo;ll never get over it.</p>

		<p>Taking a family of four or five on a camping trip requires a considerable degree of planning and organization, and you have to acquire the right equipment, and clean it and store it properly after the trip is over.  The first major camping  trip is going to be fairly expensive, although later trips reusing the same equipment will be inexpensive, if the campsite isn&rsquo;t too far from home.  The highlight of the trip is usually some water-related activity, like fishing, boating, waterskiing or swimming   &mdash;   activities which are generally unpopular with blacks.</p>
<p>The ideal vacation for blacks is typically a &#8220;glamour&#8221; vacation.  They want to be in elegant surroundings or in a tropical paradise sort of a place, and be waited on hand and foot.  Lots of white people prefer this sort of vacation too, but lots of whites genuinely prefer &#8220;roughing it.&#8221;  Few blacks are interested in &#8220;roughing it.&#8221;</p>
