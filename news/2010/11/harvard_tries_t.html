<h1>Harvard Tries to Diversify Portraits on Campus</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WHDH-TV (Boston), November 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Harvard University {snip} is hanging portraits of members of its community who are black, Asian and otherwise nonwhite, moving away from a gallery that&rsquo;s too predominantly white.</p>
<p>A 2002 inventory by the curator of the university&rsquo;s portrait collection found that of about 750 oil portraits in libraries, dining commons and undergraduate residences, about 690 were of white men. Only two portraits, commissioned in the 1980s and 90s, were of minorities.</p>
<p>The remaining portraits were of white women  &mdash;  Radcliffe professors, benefactors&rsquo; family members, presidents&rsquo; wives.</p>
<p>Dr. S. Allen Counter, director of The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, says Harvard officials want to place more portraits but will not displace other portraits.<br>

		<p>I think we need to do a study on why blacks self-esteem is so low that we constantly have to &#8220;pump them up&#8221; with fake awards and acomplishments. God forbid anyone anywhere says anything bad about the protected species of North America.</p>

		<p>An old organization either sets the standards, or they become archaic.</p>
<p>I can very easily envision a day when Harvard, Yale, Brown, and the other Ivy League schools are covered with spray paint, broken windows, with Morris Brown and TSU type scandals, while the currently lesser known colleges are churning out the next generation of top (white and asian) scientists. </p>

		<p>If you want to make the hanging of portraits gender and race neutral why not just hang portraits of people who have contributed to the university without considering those non-merit factors? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but those portraits reflect the history of the school, its professors, benefactors, etc.  When they have enough nonwhites who distinguish themselves there or who donate a lot of money, then they can earn the right to have a portrait there.  It should not be done with unearned priviledge simply for the religion known as diversity.</p>

<p>Notice that MSM newswriters never question a claim that anything is ever  &#8220;too white.&#8221; No scare quotes are ever used. The word &#8220;claim&#8221; is nonexistent. It is always unquestioned. </p>
<p>Yet if a white says or does something &#8220;racist&#8221; it is front-page news. This is how you condition a populace to consider perfectly normal behavior as outrageous  &mdash;  by throwing a hysterical fit over it  &mdash;  and to accept outrageous behavior as perfectly normal  &mdash;  by never even questioning it.</p>

		<p>Perhaps concession on this issue for the sake of diversity is a good idea, and those who promote it are onto something. It&rsquo;s the least &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; non-racist people can do. Wonder if the black student center, black united students office, and the african american studies department, wonder if they are changing the look of their office walls too or instead making even more commitments to blackness. How about the office of race relations?</p>

<p>God, I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers, hoping that radical leftist bastion is forced to close it&rsquo;s doors due to a lack of funds.</p>
<p>Or maybe what they deserve is to have funds just low enough they have to eliminate freebie scholarships to non-whites, plus all the nonsense courses, resulting in all the self-hating whites pulling their hair out.  Then to add insult to injury, maybe the blacks should give them the same treatment as they do everybody else, and group around them in a mob whenever they go out calling them whitey, honky and all the rest.</p>

		<p>This, I am sure, is the case with universities across the country.</p>
<p>Is this going to be the next black &#8220;project&#8221;?</p>
<p>If they insist on equal numbers of illustrious graduates, scholars, professors, etc., they&rsquo;re going to be very disappointed.  Where will they get them?</p>
<p>If there MUST be equality even in pictures, then the obvious and only alternative is to remove ALL the pictures from the walls entirely. Remove the statues too.</p>
<p>And, I have no doubt that in time this will be done! It&rsquo;s part of the de-whitening of America and the gradual expunging of our very presence.  One step at a time.</p>

		<p>As a WASP, I resent the attempt to remove my culturial heiratege from such an iconic institution.  Rather than embrace diversity, what they are trying to do is steal it.  A million years can pass, but it will never change the fact that Harvard (and Yale for that matter) were started by my ancestors and Latino&rsquo;s, Blacks, or Indians (dots not feathers).</p>

<p>Blacks already have great self-esteem, that no degree of incompetence can make a dint on.</p>
<p>This policy is about keeping white self-esteem low.</p>

		<p>I suggest that portraits of blacks must be painted by black artists. This would entail the former sitting still for a while and give the latter something useful to do. This may take some time. Meantime&hellip; who judges if the paintings have sufficient merit to be hung, and do the subject blacks object to being &#8216;hung&rsquo; for all to see? Methinks this could be a minefield of racial political correctness and perhaps Dr. S. Allen Counter has not quite thought through the implications.</p>

		<p>I doesn&rsquo;t matter to me how many portraits of third-worlders they put up at Harvard. Massachusetts will be on the other side of a well-guarded border after this nation finally divides into America and New Haiti, and the Whites who shaped or supported that pathetic state&rsquo;s social policies deserve whatever they get. The ones with any sense should be getting out their caw keys and hitting the road while there is still time to do so.   </p>

		<p>I agree with poster number one - I&rsquo;m really getting sick of this country and sometimes I just want to leave.  But where to go?  The UK is just as insanely politically correct as we are, and will be just as &#8220;brown&#8221; as us by 2050.  Australia?  Same problem.  Canada, New Zealand?  Same problem.  Germany?  same problem, even worse with all those Turks.  France?  Moslems everywhere.  I think Japan would be nice, but who wants to learn Japanese and live out the rest of their days among foreigners?</p>
<p>This article really disgusts me.  I recently read David McCullough&rsquo;s biography of Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s early life.  And apparently, in Theodore&rsquo;s day, Harvard University was the epitomy of the WASP-infested, high-brow, stuck-up, elitist university.  Of course, it still is, but instead of being the school of &#8220;No Irish Need Apply,&#8221; let alone blacks, foreigners, and even Catholics and Jews, they now define themselves as better than everyone else, not because of their wealth, race, or social class, but simply because they lead the far-left intellectual movement in America.</p>

		<p>The standards can be lowered for blacks.  We can pass a million laws to make them feel better and to give them a leg up.  However, they will always be behind us and we will always be called racists no matter what we do for them.  The excuses and money is running out for them.</p>

		<p>Forget the portraits&hellip; Why is there not a white student center, and a white united students type organization on campus. How many would Harvard need to match the number present at Harvard for people of color? If it&rsquo;s Ok for people of color and even needed for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; why is it not needed for white students? How can they promote &#8216;diversity&rsquo; (and these groups as the embodiment of diversity) on campus and yet not include whites? Universities in America, from Harvard to Howard, have not yet begun to embrace diversity. They actively promoting it&rsquo;s opposite, exclusion. And a racial consciousness for people of color but a sort of &#8216;racelessness&rsquo; for whites (aside from role as officially designated oppressor). They&rsquo;re promoting racism, from top to bottom. And whites can&rsquo;t be seen as having interests or really even be seen as people to make it work.  </p>
