<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black males have higher rates of incarceration and of repeat offenses that land them back in jail or prison, statistics show.</p>
<p>Changing that dynamic could begin with expunging their criminal records.</p>
<p>That was the consensus of a discussion Thursday sponsored by the Gary Commission on the Social Status of Black Males in conjunction with the East Chicago-based group Working Outside the Walls and an alliance of grassroot activists.</p>
<p>The panel discussion brought together activists, religious leaders, law enforcement officers and area legislators to talk about a possible Expungement Summit in Northwest Indiana. Expunging the criminal records of juveniles and adults would help them find jobs and turn their lives around, said Bennie Muhammed, GCSSBM executive director.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brown [Dorothy Brown, clerk of the Cook County (Ill.) Circuit Court] recommended that all agencies working with ex-offenders help organize and participate in an expungement summit. That includes police departments, the courts, lawyers, the public defenders office and the prison review board, Brown said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some offenses, however, don&rsquo;t qualify for expungement, including first-degree murder, sexual offense of a minor and DUI, Brown said.</p>
<p>Current state finances may play a part in helping ex-offenders more quickly expunge their arrest and prison records to reduce the rate of recidivism, or relapse into criminal behavior, especially among black males, said Muhammed and state Rep. Vernon G. Smith, D-Gary.</p>

		<p>There is reason to believe that many people are born for crime. Studies in Iowa, Sweden, and Denmark have indicated that identical twins are more likely to be similar in criminal behavior than fraternal twins. These studies have also indicated a stronger correlation in adopted children between felony convictions among the biological parents and the biological children than between the adopted children and their adoptive parents.   <br>

     In the Soviet Union in 1959 scientists captured wild rats and divided them into two colonies. Rats in one colony were bred for tameness. Rats in the other colony were bred for ferocity. Currently the rats in the tame colony would make excellent pets. They love to be held and petted. The rats in the other colony hiss at the approach of a human. They violently resist being held. The environments for these rats are identical. The fact that tameness and ferocity can be influenced genetically has obvious implications for criminology. <br>

A genetic predisposition to engage in crime would explain why efforts at rehabilitation are unreliable.  It would indicate that we should know who has committed felonies in the past.  </p>

		<p>Perfect way to disadvantage LAW ABIDING blacks in the job market! If employers can&rsquo;t check whether a black job applicant has a criminal background, they&rsquo;re going to do all they can to avoid taking a chance on ANY black.  <p>Great example of how the supposed &#8220;good intentions&#8221; (read: moral primping) of liberals wind up hurting the blacks they claim to want to help.</p></p>

		<p>Until now, most risky black males were kept out of respectable jobs because would-be employers could see their criminal record.  Blacks with no criminal record have been much sought after to fill affirmative action posts and, if a company could find such lower risk blacks, then they could both satisfy the law and have a decent chance of not getting burned in the process.</p>
<p>With practices such as the one described in the article, companies might decide to skip hiring blacks altogether since it&rsquo;s too risky.  Instead, they&rsquo;ll try to fill their affirmative action spots with Asians or Hispanics.  This would be a logical reaction to such measures - but watch blacks be the first to complain when this happens.</p>

		<p>And they&rsquo;ll also be able to purchase and own firearms legally, and become cops, too.  But I get the sense that if such a scheme happens, it will happen in such a way that it &#8220;expunges&#8221; the records in the eyes of potential employers, landlords, and so on, but not for the BATFE and other agencies in the legal firearm purchase chain of information.</p>
<p>The original article says:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In Indiana, the rate of recidivism has gone down to 30 percent&#8221; primarily because the state&rsquo;s budget is in a financial crisis, Smith said. &#8220;The state is now aggressive in reducing recidivism.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I think that is merely because cops don&rsquo;t have the resources to make arrests.  If the budget situation were better, then the cops would be able to make the arrests, and the recidivism rate would be higher.  It&rsquo;s easy not to be a criminal if there&rsquo;s no well-funded legitimate government to force you into the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>This story involves Indiana, but it&rsquo;s relevant to the parts near Chicago.  Unfortunately, Pat &#8220;The Pardoner&#8221; Quinn won re-election for Governor, meaning no CCW in Illinois for at least another four years.  I can easily see him issuing a bunch of pardons to accomplish the same thing by Gubernatorial fiat.</p>
<p>Another way this scheme might happen, and this is hilarious, also from the Chicago area:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yav9u49" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yav9u49</a></p>
<p>I should add that there are a lot of legit ways to have a relatively minor felony criminal record wiped away.  It usually involves going through some sort of program, and actually proving that you&rsquo;re a changed person, and letting investigators run a fine-toothed comb through your life and background since you got out of prison.  Mostly it applies to middle aged men who committed their felony as young men.  But since this sort of program has standards, and requires participants to demonstrate contrition, it&rsquo;s useless to most blacks who could benefit.  Look for states which have these programs to weaken the standards for the case of affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Oh sure, let&rsquo;s expunge their criminal records. That&rsquo;ll make them automatically become fine upstanding citizens. How about not even giving them a criminal record. Even better, how about not even bothering to arrest them in the first place  &mdash;  just let them run amok with no checks on their behavior whatsoever  &mdash;  would THAT make these liberal brain-dead idiots wake up? Nah, I doubt it&hellip; </p>

		<p>There is no way this would work.  According to statistics the average black male, before he was locked up, has had up to a hundred contacts with law enforcment. Apparently none of them did any good<br>
Many black convicts do not think like normal people, i,e. &#8216;&hellip;there is no such thing as good or bad, wright or wrong&hellip;.&rsquo;  These convicts normally have a prefix letter M, N or even higher. (On the first conviction a convict will get a number with letter A before it.  Each consecutive conviction will keep the same number but change the letter to B, C, D.</p>
<p>Many, many black convicts consider periodic incarcerration to be part of doing business.  Clearing their ecords will not have any effect on future convictions.</p>

<p>So, let me get this straight. A convicted rapist would get their record expunged? That is exactly what white women need - more black men roaming about free to attack, rape and murder (2nd degree of course - they never mean to murder when they stab their victim 20 times). It is just because everybody is so racist!!</p>

<p>And if they don&rsquo;t believe it, what does that say about their goals in trying to advance this agenda?</p>
<p>If someone aids a criminal to commit another rape, robbery, murder or assault, aren&rsquo;t they just as guilty as the criminal?  Should they not share the same punishment?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Erasing their criminal pasts will help them find jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, so they can get in a position to steal, rape and kill.</p>
<p>The black male is an abysmal failure in trying to compete in advanced societies, and nothing will change that until it is finally openly recognized and they are encouraged to go into some kind of manual labor position.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m betting that even if given free training with pay a very large percentage of them will still prefer to turn to crime, because it&rsquo;s easier and pays better.</p>
<p>Black male incompetence and propensity toward crime is a societal problem in the West that will never be solved.  <br>

		<p>hey, why stop there, let&rsquo;s fabricate resumes and fake diplomas for these fine young men, then they could get really good jobs. Expunging the records of blacks will only allow them to stay out of prison a while longer while they rack up a new criminal record as they exploit a new territory, the work place.  And it will have the same effect as Afro-Action, employers will suspect every new black applicant of being  an ex-con.</p>

		<p>So in other words, innocent and unsuspecting employers shouldn&rsquo;t even know about the criminal backgrounds of the ex-cons they are good enough to hire? Sounds like a good idea to me.</p>
<p>Of course, these ex-cons could demonstrate their good intentions by doing volunteer work and building up a positive work record that way, but that is too much to expect of these fragile, shaky beings who are just one step away from committing their next criminal act unless we help them! </p>
<p>Wait a minute! If they&rsquo;re that close to recidivism, why should potential employers receive no warning about it?</p>
<p>They commit the crimes, but it is society&rsquo;s obligation and responsibility to take all the risk in reforming these criminals, and getting none of the credit for it at the same time.</p>
<p>But what do you expect from something called The Gary Commission on the Social Status of Black Males?</p>

		<p>How does this reconcile with the Clinton passed Welfare Reform Act of 1996 (or whenever) that gave those on welfare, or have a criminal record, and advantage over those not on the dole or with clean records, by requiring a survey attached to job applications and offering a tax break to those who hire those on welfare or who have a criminal record?</p>

<p>I wonder if they have a plan to explain the gap in employment on their resumes or job applications.</p>
<p>A program like this would work only until someone returned to their instinctual habits and committed a heinous crime at work. Once it was revealed that this person had a rap sheet and record as long as a yard stick would there be an outcry to end the program. Then come the lawsuits.</p>

		<p>Sounds like the same stupid mentality concerning illegal aliens.  If we just amnesty them, they will become lawful, and respectful of our laws.  If we wipe out the criminal records of blacks, they will magically seek jobs, and become law abiding.  Is anybody really THAT stupid??????  Well, some folks must be.  We know what will happen.  The blacks, having had their records expunged, and no more threat of three strikes laws hanging over their head, will take the free ride and offend again.  Plus, having been given yet another sign that their skin color grants them special privileges even as to their criminality, they will become WORSE not better.  And more demanding.  And feeling of even MORE entitlement.  The black man has shown gratitude for NOTHING we have done to his benefit.  He only grows more arrogant and more demanding and more contemptuous of us.  This is the DUMBEST and most self destructive idea Whites have come up with yet.  </p>

		<p>Under Democrat President Jimmy Carter and his EEOC official Eleanore Holmes Norton the Feds did all possible to prevent use of tests, because Blacks did so poorly.  Norton also sought to prevent use of school and criminal records because of the disparate impact on Blacks.  So now, with affirmative action, a poor white man, who was good in and out of school, must compete with a Black who was rotten in school and possibly a thief for a job.  If records are purged, even for an opening as teller in a bank, the white will remain unemployed, and the man who had stolen will get the job because of affirmative action, and then have chance to steal again.</p>

		<p>This is totally ridiculous. I mean, with this line of thinking, why even bother arresting black criminals in the first place?</p>
<p>But here is another issue. Let&rsquo;s say these wacko activist groups get something like this pushed through somewhere. It will turn in on itself - like Affirmative Action has. </p>
<p>For example, you see a black at an Ivy League school or other elite college or university. Many people think (but often won&rsquo;t say it) oh, look, an affirmative action dumbo.</p>
<p>Now you have Tyrone applying for a job. He states he has a clean criminal record. But even if he does the employer will think - oh, the record has probably been expunged. So, many employers (and others) will start to have so little faith in a criminal background check they simply won&rsquo;t hire any blacks. </p>
<p>In the end, blacks should focus their energy on the importance of living within the law - not on how to have the records of lawlessness erased. </p>

		<p>This would never be allowed in Britain (I hope) as it would be  racist to not give such a privilege to ALL races and groups.  It would also lead to good reasons for employers to fire such employees as they would lie on the applications for work, and in the USA if this is passed, I would expect many employers to not generally employ AA -s as they could not rely on their factual past history as listed on the applications for employment forms. Most forms I have read have a statement that the information on the form is 100% fact and by signing the form it is in effect a sworn statement. </p>
<p>I have heard of some stupid proposals in my time, some 72 years, but this one takes the biscuit.   </p>

<p><i>Some offenses, however, don&rsquo;t qualify for expungement, including first-degree murder, sexual offense of a minor and DUI, Brown said.</i></p>
<p><br>
That still leaves an awful lot of leeway. Only three categories of offenses that can&rsquo;t be expunged versus lord-only-knows how many hundreds or maybe even thousands of offenses that can (at least for BLACK criminals) be expunged?</p>
<p>Has Mr. Bennie Muhammed considered that the unintended consequence of this, would be that white employers   &mdash;   indeed, all white people generally   &mdash;   will start making the assumption that EVERY black they meet has committed SOME kind of crime or other, but that all traces of it has been erased? That every time white employers ask a black job applicant if they&rsquo;ve ever been in trouble with the law, and the black says &#8220;No,&#8221; that the employers will (quite understandably) say to themselves, &#8220;He&rsquo;s probably lying, he probably has a criminal record but he had it erased&#8221;?</p>
<p>Result? Even those whose black who are genuinely law-abiding will be suspected of having a criminal past. Expunging the records of criminal will serve only to punish and incriminate non-criminal blacks. </p>

		<p>9 Didactic:</p>
<p>AR had the story about someone convicted of Murder 2 that Detroit Mayor Dave Bing wanted to put on the BOPC.  Someone either in that thread or another similar thread made a unique point with which I agree   &mdash;   It is illogical to treat Murder 2 convicts much less harshly than Murder 1, because second-degree murderers are much more dangerous than first-degree murderers   &mdash;   The essence of Murder 2 is inability to control one&rsquo;s passion.  So Murderers 2 are more dangerous to people with whom he might not have long standing established relationships.  Yet, according to this proposal, Murder 2 could be expunged.  (Murder 1 won&rsquo;t be, but since the punishment for Murder 1 in most states is either death or life w/o parole, it&rsquo;s moot anyway).  I don&rsquo;t catch the drift of that.</p>
<p>If Michigan takes up this policy, then the 2nd Degree Murderer that Bing wants on the BOPC could have his conviction wiped away, and therefore have a clean sheet.  However, per my theory above, I think the sheets will only be wiped clean in the eyes of employers and landlords, but still be available to prevent the felons from buying guns and becoming cops or quasi-cops.</p>

		<p>We are not sheep.  We know how to work as a group, where not to go.  When not to go.  How to arm ourselves, even with non lethals, if need be.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s assume that the real issue her is an undue influence upon the black community from not having their men around to help boost earnings potential or keep families together and that this has an -honest to goodness- justification: if you recommit as a felon, you are bound to face stiffer penalties the next time around.</p>
<p>I say expunge the prior bad acts.  I even go further and say &#8220;Let trial and sentencing represent overcrowding in the prison system with only the top felony the prosecution thinks it can successfully prove held against the defendent.  Of any color.&#8221;  I would even go so far as to &#8216;class&rsquo; felonies, by their length of prison terms:  2-4-6 tops.  For all but the clinically insane or those (serial rapists etc.) who pose a continuing threat to society.</p>
<p>Conditionally.</p>
<p>1.  Your record doesn&rsquo;t go away to government or any institution where you are responsible for more than say 250,000 dollars.  Which is to say banking.</p>
<p>2.  If you do 3 in a row, we kill you.  No ifs ands or buts.  You knew what was coming, you were given short sentences and fair treatment upon exiting the institution.  Now, because of predilection for criminality, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>I am tired of seeing good tax money chase bad at the rate of 30-40,000 dollars a year, per individual, for criminal incarceration.</p>
<p>Indeed, IMO, the greatest argument for creating a social welfare state where ALL needs are supplied, &#8216;free of charge&rsquo; (housing, water, electricity, food, electronic entertainment, clothing) is that we could create welfare tenements far kinder than &#8216;the projects&rsquo; now are.  And still not spend more than 18-20,000 per person, per year, on the simple basis of economies of scale.</p>
<p>As an example: everyone want Pizza Hut tonight?  Go for it.  The Feds will pay 5 bucks per large everything-on-it pizza to whatever company wins the &#8216;by popular demand&rsquo; contract to provide 50,000,000 pizzas, once a week, to every community of the socially indigent out there.</p>
<p>Pizza Hut, Dominos, MacDonalds.  They would line up to get these contracts.</p>
<p>And Crime Would Disappear.</p>
<p>Of course there is also a restrictor here too.  If you once go into this system, you will be sterilized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to stop pretending people.  The solution (mass incarceration) is as bad as the problem.  And it will never get better in a &#8216;work for it!&rsquo; sense, as long as those of </p>

		<p>I believe that if something is a non-violent misdemeanor and a first time offense, say for drugs, a person regardless of their race should have the option of having their record expunged if they complete the requirements of their punishment, but not for repeat offenses or violent crimes.</p>

		<p>Just as printing of money by the FED over the years has greatly diminished the dollars buying power, a practice of hiding a black&rsquo;s criminal record may likely reduce the value of every black&rsquo;s job application, including of course, those who have done no wrong. This is without even considering a similar part affirmative action may have already played. </p>
<p>It is as rotten a deal for worthy blacks as anyone who has carefully saved dollars and seen them devalued.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve just had a second thought about the rationale behind this insane &#8220;wiping out the records&#8221; idea.  And it&rsquo;s not so insane after all, from a certain perspective.  It&rsquo;s outrageous, but to the folks promoting this abomination, it has merit of a stealth character.  We&rsquo;ve just seen a HUGE revolt of Whites against the BRA (Black Run America) agenda.  The liberals lost most White conservatives and independents and no amount of Obama worship could keep them from deserting.  That flight from Obama, coupled with the FACT that a MAJOR portion of a MINOR voting block - a voting block consistently siding with the welfare-nanny-state redistribution of wealth from workers to shirkers - a MAJOR part of the voting block is ineligible to vote due to felonies on their records.  Remove the felonies, and you swell the ranks of that voting block immediately - and in time for 2012 if you can get enough Whites to fall for this trick.   That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about.  It&rsquo;s just the push to allow felons to vote proposed in a different way - but for the same reason.  If blacks were NOT such a predictable voting block, you can BET this would NOT be on the table at all.<br>
For the same reason that the Dems and liberals always try to make it hard for the military to get their absentee ballots in on time - a military composed of a large number of blacks&hellip;..it&rsquo;s thought that the military is more conservative in general.<br>
This proposal would never have come up if blacks voted half conservative, half liberal historically and statistically.  They vote blindly and en-bloc for liberals and the welfare state.  Hence, the proposal.</p>

		<p>Cindy, if DUI is attempted murder then all those that use cell phones, text, are prescription medicated, shave, drink a coffee, eat a doughnut, check out a hot girl or do anything at all that impedes or distracts them while driving are guilty of attempted murder in your way of thinking.  I know many people who got nailed for DWI and not one of them ever wanted to hurt anybody. Alcohol impedes your ability to drive just like everything that I mentioned above does. To assume these people are murderers is nothing but &#8221; LOONY&#8221;.  </p>
