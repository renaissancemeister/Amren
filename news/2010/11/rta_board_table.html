<h1><a href="https://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/11/post_392.html">RTA Board Tables Proposed Crackdown on Juvenile Fare Violators</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Breckenridge, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Nov. 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>RTA&rsquo;s board has tabled, and effectively killed, a controversial proposal to crack down on youths who aren&rsquo;t paying fares on rapid-transit lines. </p>
<p>George Dixon, chairman of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority board, said Tuesday that he feared the policy would fall too heavily on young black males and minority communities served by the transit lines. </p>
<p>Dixon said he and at least two other black male members of RTA&rsquo;s nine-member board had concerns about sending young fare-jumpers to the county&rsquo;s juvenile court. </p>
<p>Minority leaders have long been concerned about the disproportionate number of blacks in the county&rsquo;s juvenile and adult court systems. </p>
<p>The fare-jumping policy, supported by RTA General Manager Joe Calabrese, would not have resulted in a criminal violation for youths who didn&rsquo;t pay the fine. Instead, they would have performed community service, possibly at RTA facilities, under the juvenile court&rsquo;s diversion program. </p>
<p>[snip}</p>
<p>RTA officials believe they are losing tens of thousands of dollars to youths abusing an honor-based fare system on the HealthLine and Red Line rapids. </p>
<p>Calabrese proposed a plan under which young scofflaws, and their parents, would receive notice of a $50 fine. They would have 30 days to pay or face having the case referred to juvenile court. </p>
<p>RTA transit police have few options now in dealing with young scofflaws, other than arresting them. Other transit systems levy fines on them, Calabrese noted. </p>
<p>Before the vote, an ACLU official asked RTA officials to consider the &#8220;racial implications&#8221; of a policy that could add to the disproportionate number of blacks and other minorities in the juvenile court system. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dixon said tabling the policy had nothing to do with concerns expressed recently by the Cleveland NAACP that an increasing number of young black men are being arrested on some RTA lines. </p>

In the 90&rsquo;s, I was waiting in line behind two Hispanic women from California. One was telling the other about the practice of large numbers of people (I&rsquo;m guessing they were Hispanic) who would rush the trains and ride for free. She said, &#8220;we do it all the time&#8221;.</p>
<p>When the system goes bankrupt and shuts down, no more free rides. I wonder who the Hispanics will blame?</p>

		<p>I simply do not understand this article. There is a blatant admission by all concerned parties that the majority of freeriders are black and are engaging in illegal activity. That fact is neither in dispute nor taken to be a sign of any ill-will towards or long-standing discrimination against blacks. But the idea of there being a disproportionate number of blacks in the juvenile detention center warrants rethinking enforcement of a law that is agreed to be disproportionately broken by blacks? I just cannot understand this. Are we really supposed to think that we need to maintain an artificial proportionate prison population even though we know and have no problem admitting that the distribution of criminals is not similarly proportionate? </p>

		<p>St. Louis&rsquo;s light rail has such an honor system with its light rail line.  If you ride STL&rsquo;s light rail, then you&rsquo;ll encounter random checks every once in awhile.  However, I have been told that at &#8220;certain stations&#8221; on the light rail, (all of them in the black sections of St. Louis City, East St. Louis IL and the western part of Belleville IL), the transit system&rsquo;s security guards are demanding proof of payment/ticket or monthly/weekly pass if you stand around on the station pavilion for any length of time, or want to know a legitimate reason why not if you don&rsquo;t have one (e.g. waiting for someone in a wheelchair who is on the light rail so you can push him or her to wherever they need to go).  They force you out of the station if you have neither.</p>
<p>If a vast majority of people in Cleveland&rsquo;s juvenile justice system are black, then instead of using this as an excuse not to punish fare jumpers, this is probably proof that most of them are/will be black.</p>
<p>BTW, what about adult fare jumpers?</p>

		<p>That is entirely illogical. It&rsquo;s like saying we already have enough black criminals so let&rsquo;s not arrest anymore even though they keep breaking the law.</p>
<p>The true disgrace is the utter lack of personal responsibility and social awareness built into the ruling. What does this say to young blacks about living in a civilized society? I&rsquo;d ask where the parents are on this issue but we all know.</p>

		<p>This is the problem with ethnic and racial diversity: each group has a different set of moral values.  Europeans are successful, in part, because of their shared ideas of morality and fainess.  Different races have different ideas about morality (and marrage, responsibility, life style, etc.).  Multiple (multicultural) morality systems cannot co-exist in the same society.  It causes constant stress and conflict, eventually leading to warfare and even genocide.  This is not a problem in homeogeneous societies.  </p>

		<p>I bought a motor scooter to get around while living in San Francisco.  I would be sitting on the streetcar in my surgical scrubs while going home from work and be hassled all of the time by the fare inspectors.  Meanwhile the young black guys with their butt cracks hanging out of their pants were never even approached by the fair inspectors.  I also noticed that the drivers were largely black in a job where they made as much or more than I did in health care.  By the way I am a blond-hair, blue-eyed white woman.  Do you think that the harassment I encountered was any coincidence?  What I bought was made by Honda but was about the size of a Vespa so I didn&rsquo;t spend much on fuel and didn&rsquo;t have to watch my belongings every second that I was on the train anymore either.</p>

		<p>Taking advantage of something that in their eyes is &#8220;free&#8221; is a hallmark of blacks.  Unless there is a person of some authority to enforce the &#8220;honor system&#8221; blacks will abuse it every time.  </p>

<p>Laughably, what would change in the juvenile court system on that score. &ldquo;Blacks and other minorities&rdquo; of &ldquo;youth,&rdquo; commit a disproportionate number of crimes and are thus &ldquo;overrepresented&rdquo; there anyway. Simple math and what is a sociological rule of nature, is what that is. Sincerely, there should be only three punishments for blacks and other minorities regardless of age breaking the laws in this country:</p>
<p>1.) Disruptive behaviors and misdemeanors, should be met with a public pillorying and a flogging;</p>
<p>2.) Theft, other property crimes, and drug dealing, should be solved through imprisonment for life at hard labor;</p>
<p>3.) Crimes of violence such as rape, assault, and murder, should be resolved via the guillotine.</p>
<p>Enough said,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>I love the story  &mdash;  I think it&rsquo;s from Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s *The Tipping Point* in the chapter on Mayor Giuliani  &mdash;  where fare evaders on the NYC subway were held on the platform in plain sight of the public.  Each new evader was daisy-chained to the previous one with handcuffs, so that passengers could gape at and point fingers at the chain of miscreants.  Later in the day, the paddy wagon  &mdash;  equipped with all the resources needed for instant booking  &mdash;  took in the chain, as a new chain began to form on the platform. </p>
<p>Just yesterday I saw a Hispanic couple do the two-for-one thing with the Boston subway fare gates.  These are high plexiglass gates equipped with sensors so that they refuse to open if you&rsquo;re too close to them  &mdash;  to prevent 2 people squeezing together to enter as a single body.  However there&rsquo;s an art to tricking the sensors and these Hispanics had mastered the right squeeze, so to speak.  </p>
<p>I can also remember &#8216;way back, when Boston had metal turnstiles, a Hispanic family crouching down, one by one, to crawl under the turnstile bars.  One &#8220;good girl&#8221; in the family hesitated:  &#8220;?Donde vas a cambiar?&#8221; the others pleaded with her  &mdash;  &#8220;When are you going to change?&#8221;  Wonder how much this is a Hispanic thing. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s next? Affirmative action to arrest more Whites to remedy &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; amounts of black criminals? ACLU and NAACP need to stop the denial of the obvious truth that blacks are in the majority when it comes to criminal activity. They should look at these statistics with shame rather than denial.</p>

		<p>The message that the Cleveland RTA is giving young black youths is that it&rsquo;s OK to steal; pure and simple. One more brick in the ever crumbling foundation of civilized society is smashed to bits in the once great city of Cleveland. There are literally hundreds of other examples in major urban areas across the country where officials simply acquiesce to the bad behavior of black criminals. Decent people can no longer live in these areas and soon won&rsquo;t be able to work there either. If you own a business, move it as far away from the inner city as you can. </p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t narcotics/vice law &mdash; there isn&rsquo;t a way to tax people abusing a service to compensate society for their abuses. The law is the law (in this case), and if someone breaks it, they will be punished according to a social cost/benefit analysis performed by the judiciary. There is no &#8220;need&#8221; to imprison people, outside of the need of society to isolate/incarcerate/monitor those whose behavior costs government more than the already-massive margin it operates with.</p>
<p>Hang out in a subway terminal north of City Hall in Philly &mdash; one feels like they&rsquo;ve passed into a territory with an alternate set of laws. Unfortunately, especially on the El, lower class whites (emulating their underclass brethren) behave the same way. Proportionally lower, by my experience, but you still have the kid dressing/acting like a street thug behaving like someone lower than his/her potential.</p>

		<p>This story is the proverbial straw today. I&rsquo;ve heard and read enought to go screaming into the streets. In California, American college students will see their tuition raised dramatically, while illegal aliens get in-state rates. The murderer of almost 300 American Embassy workers is only convicted of one of the murders. Now, the preponderance of black kids who beat the system are getting a pass. Why do we keep turning the other cheek? I&rsquo;ve decided we need to fight fire with fire. The world laughs at us. All you need to do to game the system is break into our country and you&rsquo;re home free. Excuse me, I&rsquo;m going out to scream now!</p>
