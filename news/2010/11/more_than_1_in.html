<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2010 study led by the government-funded Medical Research Foundation says that in Gauteng province, home to South Africa&rsquo;s most populous city of Johannesburg, more than 37 percent of men said they had raped a woman. Nearly 7 percent of the 487 men surveyed said they had participated in a gang rape.</p>
<p>More than 51 percent of the 511 women interviewed said they&rsquo;d experienced violence from men, and 78 percent of men said they&rsquo;d committed violence against women.</p>
<p>A quarter of the women interviewed said they&rsquo;d been raped, but the study says only one in 25 rapes are reported to police.</p>
<p>A survey by the same organization in 2008 found that 28 percent of men in Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces said they had raped a woman or girl. Of the men who had committed rape, one third did not feel guilty, said Rachel Jewkes, a lead researcher on both studies.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the men surveyed in that study said they raped because of a sense of sexual entitlement. Other popular motivating factors included a desire to punish women who rejected or angered them, and raping out of boredom, Jewkes said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jewkes believes South Africa&rsquo;s history of racial division and associated trauma is part of the reason of the high incidence of sexual violence in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apartheid has contributed to culture of impunity surrounding rape in South Africa,&#8221; said Jewkes. Men who were abused or experienced trauma during their childhood are much more likely to rape, she said, adding that apartheid destroyed family life, fostering violence and anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>The apartheid period also saw very little enforcement of common law, which has contributed to a culture of impunity, said Jewkes.</p>

		<p>I was in South Africa during the apartheid years, and I saw blacks going about their lives as taxi drivers, shop assistants, blue collar workers and farm hands, shoulder to shoulder with whites and coloureds.</p>
<p>The point is, the myth that has been built up around this word &#8216;apartheid&rsquo; is overblown. Most people who nod their heads when it is spoken of have no clue about how benign it was for the majority of the black population.</p>

		<p>I would venture a &#8220;guess&#8221; that one in three figure ONLY includes a certain segment of South African men. Certain groups of South African men are exempt from that rapist category. &#8220;Can you dig it?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Apartheid causes rape in today&rsquo;s South Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and if it isn&rsquo;t that it will be white colonialism.  Or white oppression.  Or white racism, even as minorities without any real power.</p>
<p>And if it can&rsquo;t be attributed to any of the above it&rsquo;s because the misery of a hangnail made them do it, or the witch doctor was using voodoo medicine to get them to react that way. </p>
<p>Something not the fault of the black perp HAS to be at fault, something that prompted the darling innocent black criminal to act the way he did.</p>

<p>Well, I think we have to admit this is partly true.  While our opponents usually try to paint a picture of segregation/apartheid as oppressive, full of bigots giving blacks greater sentences than whites, it was far more common for the police to treat black areas as lost causes that couldn&rsquo;t be civilized and not waste resources on them.</p>

Men who were abused or experienced trauma during their childhood are much more likely to rape, she said, adding that apartheid destroyed family life, fostering violence and anti-social behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a lie.  They make Apartheid out to be equal to slavery as it was practiced in the New World.  Blacks under Apartheid were not enslaved in chains, beaten or otherwise abused.  They basically were restricted from entering white areas unless for work and were denied opportunities in education or jobs.  </p>
<p>How does this cause a man to rape a woman?</p>
<p>Apartheid also did not last for 300-400 years, but for something like 50 years or so.  Blacks had their own &#8216;homelands&rsquo; that encompassed hundreds of square miles all over the country.  Most of the the land was uninhabited when the Boers and then English came along.  The blacks only multiplied after the steady food provided by whites allowed it to happen.</p>
<p>Even then, the average black person had no contact with whites, who were always falling in number as a percentage of the poulation.  </p>
<p>Oh, but segregation causes black men to rape women&hellip;  What a crock.</p>

		<p>lol. &#8220;Apartheid has contributed to culture of impunity surrounding rape in South Africa&#8221; black people rape because white people made them do it. what are they gonna say when they do the same study on any other african country and find the same result? i guess theyll just have to avoid getting that study made.</p>

<p>You can always tell feminist statistics   &mdash;   they paint &#8220;men&#8221; with a broad brush, but somehow never manage to get around to analyzing the racial makeup of the &#8220;men&#8221; in question.  One would think that would be an important piece of information for women who wanted to avoid being victimized, but apparently not.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Jewkes believes South Africa&rsquo;s history of racial division and associated trauma is part of the reason of the high incidence of sexual violence in the country&hellip;apartheid destroyed family life, fostering violence and anti-social behavior.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Why, of <i>course</i>, Ms Jewkes!  It&rsquo;s the fault of the Legacy of Apartheid, of course!  How could anyone be so Racist as to believe otherwise?  Hmmm&hellip; But say,could that mean that we really are talking about <i>black</i> men, here?</p>
<p>Well, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter   &mdash;   blacks are <i>never</i> responsible for their own behavior.  It&rsquo;s <i>always</i> Whitey&rsquo;s fault, somehow.</p>
<p>Thank you, comrades Nastasya Tay and Rachel Jewkes, for spelling out the Correct party line so clearly!<br>

		<p>The title of this article is extremely misleading.  I think they mean to say that &#8220;More than 1 in 3 BLACK South African men say they&rsquo;ve committed rape&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I would love to see the statistics on the regression that was used to determine that Apartheid was the most significant variable.  Was any data run on the number of rapes committed DURING the period of Apartheid (1948-1994)? </p>
<p>I suspect that there were significantly less rapes committed during that period than after it.</p>

		<p>What a load of rubbish.  Apartheid will be the excuse used by the current inept Marxist-trained terrorist government for many decades.  There was far less rape under the previous white government that was almost Calvinistic in its dealings with such crimes, and in the cases of murder regardless of race or colour, judicial hanging was the result.  The problem is that as history and current records show, rape is a very common act amongst the black peoples in Sub-Saharan Africa where as man is a man only if he &#8220;takes a woman&#8221; every day, even if he is not married, and the age of the female is of no consequence.  The very high rates of HIV/AIDS are one result. I lived there for 23 years so I am not writing from an opinion guessed at by reading Press reports as many liberals who were anti-Apartheid and now must bear some of the guilt for the conditions there that will be Zimbabwean one day.</p>
<p>As Shakespeare wrote, &#8220;The truth will out&#8221;,  one day when sensible and honest people are writing the history books.  Meanwhile innocent people must suffer, including tens of thousands of poor black Africans.</p>

		<p>Thats all? And thats just the ones who are truthful. What are the real stats? Its more like 99% who have either raped or thought about it but then again wouldnt that be the stats for the whole race worldwide? <br>
Forget the black females are there any white females left who havent been raped assaulted or murdered in SA? Dont worry. America is not far behind.</p>

Amazing statistics and yet many of our leftist gender feminists and controlled media flacks were convinced those white Duke frat-boys gang raped an innocent black stripper/felon. I think some still believe as much, and would shrug off the South African rape crisis. Oh yes, here is the reason for the South African rapes: &ldquo;Apartheid has contributed to [the] culture of impunity surrounding rape in South Africa, said Jewkes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Funny situation:<br>
What will happen if whites disappear? </p>
<p>The funny thing is, whites are the educated ones. Jews for example always write their history in details. But blacks don&rsquo;t give anything for history.</p>
<p>So if whitey disappears from most parts of the world, blacks will still blame the white devils and apartheid - without knowing what it is. I am pretty sure they will mix Nazi, Hitler, Apartheid and Voodoo together and everything what will stay in their minds will be the history a long time ago, when something like white ghosts entered the paradise (Central Africa) and destroyed everything and disappeared suddenly. </p>
<p>It would be funny how they describe the left buildings in 200 years when they haven&rsquo;t seen but only heard of whites then.    </p>

		<p>There is this curious little thing called &#8220;Personal Responsibility&#8221;. They rape because they can and then have enablers helping them blame some outside source like racisim or a legacy slavery or apartheid. It really says something of a soceity that makes excuses and covers up the acts of violent animals. Coming in full force to an American city near you soon&hellip;.if it has not already.</p>

		<p>Well, then!  Let&rsquo;s look for the silver lining.  Since most rapes are committed by young men aged 15 to 35, and since apartheid ended in 1994, the rate of rape should begin to decline each year from now on.  By 2029, when nobody under the age of 35 will have ever experienced apartheid, the South African rape rate should be approaching that of Finland.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s my question. Does South Africa have one of the world&rsquo;s highest rates of violent crime, rape, AIDs, etc? Or does it just have one of the highest REPORTED rates? </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my hypothesis: South Africa appears relatively dangerous only because other sub-Saharan Africans don&rsquo;t have the infrastructure needed to track violent crime, rape, and AIDs infections. </p>
<p>In other words, as crime and corruption go up, the ability to effectively report crime goes down. So while South Africa&rsquo;s crime rate is high, compared to Europe, East Asia, and the United States, its crime rate is understated, compared to the developed world, because of crime and corruption, but understated compared to, say, Congo or Somalia where such reporting is impractical. </p>
<p>(Likewise, I suspect this is mirrored in the United States. I am guessing crime in communities such as Oakland and Detroit are not tracked as scrupulously as they are in safer communities, making crime rate comparisons problematic) </p>
<p>Can any of the readers who are familiar with the situation in Africa, and South Africa offer a reality check on this? </p>

		<p>I wonder if white women in Cape Town and other &#8216;racist enclaves&rsquo; away from the capital have to walk around escorted by their husbands and male relatives as if they were living in Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>Pleasant Image isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Or maybe I should use the Israeli example where every one who goes to the same market as a Palestinian carries an Uzi because &#8216;it&rsquo;s a matter of when, not just in case&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Never mind, here&rsquo;s what I found interesting.  How can this-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&#8220;Rape is completely trivialized by a great number of men. It is seen as a legitimate activity,&#8221; she said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Equate to this-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&#8220;We need to start interventions in childhood, focusing on building a more empowering childhood environment in South Africa, especially for boys,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and we need to make it worth their while for women to report sexual violence.&#8221;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>????</p>
<p>&#8216;Empowering&rsquo; how, pray tell?  Report to whom, dare I ask?  Do you feminist fools -actually believe- that nonsense about how having one woman centers a man?  How fatherhood and a sense of role in the community (provider = slave) stands up to a real world scenario in which male driven anarchy means that sex is _free_ and black males who thrive on violence have never had it so good?</p>
<p>Such &#8216;empowerment&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t improve character among pop musicians, movie stars, pro athletes or (formerly) politicians.  Culture Legends from across racial boundaries speak of the sense of freedom as destiny in doing ONE THING well enough to be rewarded beyond all others and hence be able to buy off the mere mortal limits of legal transgression.</p>
<p>Now add African racial biology with a 20% higher testosterone count and a (local) average 70 IQ as well as a history of _never_ having respected, let alone empowered, women in their societies to any role whatsoever.</p>
<p>For pities sake, Shaka Zulu took a passing interest in human anatomy and had 100 pregnant women sliced open to look at fetus&rsquo; in various stages of development.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/3aaufjs" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3aaufjs</a></p>
<p>Does that sound like an &#8216;Apartheid Driven Issue&rsquo; or lack of male empowerment to you?</p>
<p>What about 50 years later when they did it again, this time to Boer women who came north with the Voortrekkers to buy land under Piet Retief?</p>
<p>Which butchery was due to a &#8216;lack of empowerment&rsquo; relative to Apartheid as a temporary social abberation instead of purely genetics driven natures?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Jewkes believes South Africa&rsquo;s history of racial division and associated trauma is part of the reason of the high incidence of sexual violence in the country.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>First off, let&rsquo;s not talk about &#8216;races&rsquo; until we talk about _tribes_.  The Zulu and Xhosa people have a genocidal hatred of each other going back, you guessed it, to Mister Intestinal Parasite himself, back when he was, you know, inventing the phrase &#8216;African Genocide&rsquo; (2 million+) all by himself.  They despise each other more than they hate whites.  Which is, along with population totals, the reason why more black women are raped in SA each year than whites.</p>
<p>Now as regards formerly white property and privileges, blacks looked up at Olympus and saw how the Gods lived and thought it should all come unto them &#8216;if only they could move there instead of here&rsquo;.  It turned out that location doesn&rsquo;t matter as much as the quality of the resident and now they are all dancing on the decks of a sinking ship, all the harder because SOME of them are smart enough to realize they don&rsquo;t like swimming.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The new study, conducted with a gender rights advocacy body, is the first community-based study of its kind with women in 12 years.</p>
<p>The group hopes to replicate the study across southern Africa.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Good luck with that.  When, one way or the other, whites are gone from sub-Saharan Africa in 20-25 years, &#8216;womens rights&rsquo; will have absolutely no hosting within the resulting social void.</p>
<p>Which may be a bad thing because given nothing else to do, they will come back home and start looking for a way to justify their views, here.</p>
<p>What amazes me is that NO ONE is talking about what happens to the _resources_ that will still be present there and throughout Africa.  Maybe because the Chinese will have it all sewn up?</p>
<p>There is only one chance for redemption here, in Africa and Globally.  We must forget trying to raise up the genetically bereft until we can genomically give them the intellect to rise as a population into true culture.</p>
<p>And to keep the world moving along until that can happen, we need anthropomorphic robots that can do the dirty work supporting the infrastructure of failed African States (and probably our own) with low or no manned, white, footprint on the ground.</p>
<p>You can bellyache about social change and typical female small-vision &#8216;empowerment&rsquo; stuff all you like.</p>
<p>But until you grab that genome by the double helix, wrestle it to the ground and start removing all the screwups and less-than-best alleles that good ol&rsquo; wonderful &#8216;Nature&rsquo; has stuck us with, we&rsquo;re all screwed.  Blacks more than most.</p>
<p>Because nobody will be allowed to compete in a manner where we can thrive and succeed at our own social levels so long as there is no acknowledgment possible that _there are levels_.</p>
<p>Idiots, Hypocrites and Fools.</p>
