<h1><a href="http://www.examiner.com/gun-rights-in-national/the-social-contract-exposes-southern-poverty-law-center">&#8216;The Social Contract&rsquo; Exposes Southern Poverty Law Center</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Codrea, National Examiner, November 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;In this special issue The Social Contract presents an unsparing indictment, and a timely debunking, of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).  Acclaimed expert on America&rsquo;s political fringes Laird Wilcox skewers the bogus scholarship and smear tactics by which SPLC has successfully sold itself to government and media as an impartial arbiter of &#8220;hate,&#8221; in an exclusive, keynote interview with Peter Gemma. TSC&rsquo;s team of accomplished contributors from the left, right, and center exposes SPLC&rsquo;s unsavory methods, dubious aims, and tawdry fundraising practices with surgical precision and comprehensive scope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed.  TSC provides a <a href="http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_20_3/index.shtml">linked index</a> for every article in this issue, covering everything from SPLC&rsquo;s &#8220;ritual defamations,&#8221; to their &#8220;hidden agenda,&#8221; all bearing in mind how immensely lucrative the venture has proven to be for founder Morris Dees and key executive staff.</p>

		<p>Morris Dees is one step ahead of the competition. He&rsquo;s joining forces with Homeland Security probably in hopes of getting federal funding and being above any further scrutiny. This guy is a crook with a capital C and he&rsquo;s well aware of who is out to get him and why. </p>
<p>This guy exists to persecute white people in all walks of life and uses his power with the media to sway people away from examining his real motives. Personally he is a reprobate and a perve just look at his 1970&rsquo;s divorce papers. The people in government and in politics in general are nothing but opportunists who deserve a cool shadow under a lamp post. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Accusatory Inversion&#8221;.  Remember that term, fellow white nationalists.  Originally coined, to my knowledge, by pro-white nationalist John de Nugent - and it&rsquo;s a perfect description of how this enemy of the white race operates.   They accuse us of the very crimes, sins and behavior that they, themselves, are guilty of   &mdash;    and which they deploy as a deadly weapon designed to genocide the White race.</p>
<p>News Flash: Every race on the planet is perfectly justified in having racial pride and being concerned about their ethnic interests.  Now, granted, there are certainly a lot of races who have to stretch a huge distance to dig up things to be proud of - but, whites are just as entitled, and more justified than most, to be honest - to take pride in our race and to wish to fight tooth and nail to preserve our race and to avoid being reduced to a minority inside our own historic homelands.  Whites have a right to survive, people. </p>
<p>Plus, whites need to get their guilt-ridden brains wrapped around the very real fact that we cannot preserve our race and the civilization created by our race without growing a pair and understanding that we cannot constantly make concessions to race card playing non-whites and still ensure our own ethnic group&rsquo;s survival.  Sooner or later, we have to start &#8216;Thinking Tribally&rsquo; and place racial loyalty ahead of every other issue.</p>
<p>The alternative is joining the Dodo Bird and the Dinosaurs.</p>

		<p>While I am very sceptical of the alleged White awakening or the growth of the &#8220;implicit Whiteness&#8221; phenomenon in America, one can clearly see a widespread rejection of this &#8220;hopelessly racist whitey&#8221; mentality as fully embodied by the likes of the SPLC. In other words, Whites are sick and tired of still being called &#8220;racists,&#8221; after decades of grovelling, boot-licking, and bending over backwards to be &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; &#8220;inclusive,&#8221; and indeed, to reject their own racial consciousness altogether in the process! One can only hope the day may come when many will<br>
grow sick of it to the point where they wake-up from their de-racinated slumber, and realize that it&rsquo;s not only okay to be White, but it is wonderful!</p>

		<p>What is so dad about the SPLC is that so many people actually believe their lies. I&rsquo;m from Alabama, but I have a sister-in-law from New Jersey. When visiting her and her family in NJ, I hear a regular litany of lies and distortions from her about the South. The last time I was up there she kept talking about all the lynchings the K was committing. She was shocked when I told her the K no longer existed. There have been no lynchings in a long long time. She started hyper-ventilating and accused me of being a member of the K. she also added she didn&rsquo;t want me around my nephews and nieces anymore! Her husband later informed me that she contributes to the SPLC and believes everything they say is Gospel.</p>
<p>Morris Dees and I went to the same college. For many, many years one of the local restaurants displayed bad checks he had written while a student. Even after he lied his way to wealth, he still would not make those checks good, even though they were for relatively small amounts.</p>

		<p>The interview with Laird Wilcox and Wilcox&rsquo;s article, &#8220;The Practice of Ritual Defamation&#8221; are alone worth far more than the cost of the Spring 2010 issue of The Social Contract, aptly titled, &#8220;Profiteers of Hate: The Smear-Mongering Agenda of the Southern Poverty Law Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sample excerpts:</p>
<p>&#8220;When you get right down to it, all the SPLC does is call people names.  It&rsquo;s specialized a highly developed form of defamation however   &mdash;  - a way of harming and isolating people by denying their humanity and trying to convert them into something that deserves to be hated and eliminated &hellip; They use their enormous resources to practice it on a mass scale &hellip; Anyone attacked by the SPLC is basically up against a contest of resources, from the ability to engage legal counsel, the access to fairness in media treatment, to the ability to survive the financial destruction of a reputation or a career.  What they do is a kind of bullying and stalking &hellip; Their victims are usually ordinary people expressing their values, opinions, and beliefs and they are up against a very talented and articulate defamation machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The SPLC has managed to engage police and government agencies to assist them, interfacing informational resources about personal circumstances vulnerability, and opportunities for prosecution.  The have even counseled the military in stigmatization and defamation procedures &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans really need to ask themselves if they are willing to tolerate this kind of operation in a free society &hellip; remember that sooner or later they might start looking at you or someone you love &hellip;&#8221;  (pp 188-189, &#8220;An Expert on Fringe Politcal Movements Reflects on the SPLC&rsquo;s Political Agenda,&#8221;)<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/33krthf" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/33krthf</a></p>
<p>And from Wilcox&rsquo;s article, &#8220;The Practice of Ritual Defamation&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not ussed to persuade, but to punish &hellip; its thrust is primarily emotional.  Ritual defamation is used to hurt, to intimidate, to destroy, and to persecute, and to avoid the dialogue, debate, and discussion upon which a free society depends.  On those grounds it must be opposed no matter who tries to justify its use.&#8221; (p191)<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/245rshx" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/245rshx</a></p>
<p>From the interview:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m still involved in civil liberties and freedom of speech issues &hellip; I think these are the critical issues of our time, and to the extent that they&rsquo;re compromised we&rsquo;re all in trouble.  As long as we can speak and write freely and discuss and debate openly, we can gradually work issues out. Extremists know this &hellip; that&rsquo;s why this kind of freedom is under attack.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The SPLC is typical of the left-wing extremists that are part of the larger Communist horde left over from the 1960&rsquo;s.  They are old Marxists with a true hatred for America and Americans.<br>
Their days are numbered now with the rise of the TEA party movement and the Reaganite youth that were raised during the last days of the Cold War.  With Obama, you are seeing the death rattle of these hippie losers.<br>
Soon the END will come for these leftists as they gradually die off and are replaced by newer Conservative generations.  Their only glimmer of hope lies in the swinehund illegals from the third world that still believe the drivel of equality and social justice.  A vain hope - to say the least.<br>
There is NO honor amongst thieves, and as the pie of these charlatans gets smaller - they will fight amongst themselves&hellip;</p>

		<p>The SPLC is another weapon designed to weaken and destroy the white race. It is neither &#8220;Southern&#8221; in the connotative sense nor is it involved with &#8220;poverty;&#8221; it is a weapon to silence dissenters to the liberal agenda and it has been exposed by this article as well as by their actions in going after &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; - or more precidely, anyone who advances White racial preservatin. The SPLC is a liberal hate group that has been &#8220;found out&#8221; and is an example of liberal intolerance and hate. Thank you, Morris Dees, for Exhibit A when the liberal agenda is fully esposed and the perpetraitors finally tried and convicted for treason and attempted genocide of White Americans. The time is coming when liberals in high places will be held accountable, and their policies reversed.</p>

		<p>Most of this information will be kept from the general public by the MSM.  What should occur to the rest of us that are in the know, how long before the SPLC will do irreparable harm to the Republic?  After all, the SPLC is conducting a fifth columnist intervention with both the military and police forces of this country.  That is treason.  In my father&rsquo;s time, WWII, the men would have shouldered arms and stormed the SPLC &#8220;hate palace&#8221;.  Actually, no such organization could have survived in that environment.  So we must then ask what is different about us now and then.  The answers are all too obvious dear reader.  Now, next what to do about it.  We vote obama out.  Rid ourselves of his henchmen Holder and Napolitano and regain respect for true Americans.  We must not let this situation go beyond 2012 for if we fail, it will be more than just scurrilous comments in a fusion center report, they will begin to eterminate all those who stand in the way.  Then our only option will be civil war.  Either way, count this vet in.  </p>

		<p>When the SPLC is tagged with the term &#8220;anti-white&#8221; its days are numbered.  Remember &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; means nothing more than being anti-white as Bob Whitaker has so logically pointed out.</p>

		<p>The Social Contract report is an excellent source of information on the most profitable &#8220;non-profit&#8221; in the Race Industry.</p>
<p>And speaking of &ldquo;nonprofits,&rdquo; in 1994, SPLC founder Morris Dees vowed that he would stop soliciting donations when the SPLC&rsquo;s Endowment Fund reached $100 million dollars. It reached that mark in 2002, yet the fund-raising letters continued to go out like clockwork.</p>
<p>By 2007, the Endowment Fund had reached $200 million, and still the fund-raising letters went out. Last year the Endowment Fund generated $39 million dollars in interest, or more than $15 million dollars in excess of the SPLC&rsquo;s total annual expenses, (minus the $5.3 million they spent on fund-raising), and yet the fund-raising letters, like this one from this past September, </p>

<p>If this be &ldquo;non-profit,&rdquo; where do I sign up??</p>
<p>The most ironic (read: &ldquo;hypocritical&rdquo;) thing about the Southern Poverty Law Center is that NOT ONE of its top ten, highest paid executives is a minority.</p>

<p>In fact, according to the SPLC&rsquo;s hometown newspaper, the Montgomery Advertiser, despite being located LITERALLY in the back yard of Dr. Martin Luther King&rsquo;s home church, the SPLC has NEVER hired a person of color to a highly paid position of power.</p>
