<h1>Shooting, Riot Create Chaotic Scene During Light Up Night</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTAE-TV (Pittsburgh), Nov. 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A scene that witnesses described as nothing short of chaotic erupted in downtown Pittsburgh on Friday night when shots were fired during Light Up Night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Channel 4 Action News&rsquo; Ari Hait reported that several riots continued to break out throughout the evening, specifically at Sixth and Wood streets. About 100 people were involved in fights in that area, police said.</p>
<p>Hait reported seeing 35 to 50 people in handcuffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone starts screaming and there&rsquo;s like a million cops and we&rsquo;re just looking and, like, all these people come running out of the building,&#8221; said witness Anna Suehr.</p>
<p>Police said a man in his 20s was found shot in the groin at the corner of Smithfield Street and Liberty Avenue shortly before 9 p.m. He was reported in stable condition at UPMC Mercy.</p>
<p>Investigators are not certain if the shooting was self-inflicted, according to a police news release.</p>
<p>Police searched for a suspect and witnesses while trying to direct people away from the scene, but a series of fights then broke out nearby. Officers were called from all over the city to respond with the help of K-9 units.</p>
<p>Four juveniles were cited for disorderly conduct and were released to their parents; one juvenile was bitten by a K9 and was transported to a local hospital for treatment; and one person was detained to be interviewed regarding the shooting, police said.</p>

						<p>
							<i>KDKA-TV (Pittsburgh), Nov. 20, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pittsburgh&rsquo;s annual Light Up Night celebration is supposed to be a night of family fun and entertainment in downtown that kicks off the holiday season.<br>
However, Friday evening&rsquo;s festivities were marred by violent scenes.<br>
Officials say one young woman was arrested for attacking another woman in front of police. There were other arrests for fighting as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A woman who did not want to be identified was a few feet away when the shooting happened. She said she was boarding a bus with two small children at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were scared, especially the 10-year-old. I think the 4-year-old wasn&rsquo;t really quite sure what was happening. He knew that there was a gunshot because everybody was talking about it on the bus. The 10-year-old kept telling me how scared he was,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s such a shame because this is such a fun event for families. For something like this to happen, you got to wonder, should I go downtown or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Holly Geitner, with the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, wanted to assure the public that downtown Pittsburgh is a safe place to visit.</p>
<p>What happened last night, as we understand, it was a very isolated incident,&#8221; said Geitner. &#8220;The location of where things happened was pretty far removed from where we had the event programmed and planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have taken every measure that we can foresee to ensure the safety of everybody that comes down to enjoy tonight&rsquo;s festivities,&#8221; added Pittsburgh Police Sgt. James Vogel.</p>

		<p>So white people (the ones who work and save and therefore HAVE money) will drift away from the stores in the downtown (rapidly browning area).  </p>
<p>The city will decline.  The remaining middle class will slink off to the suburbs for safety.  Blacks will eventually follow the whites to whatever suburb they create.  </p>
<p>They will bring their violent ways.  Whites will retreat once more.  Add latinos to the mix and it will accelerate.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat&hellip;</p>

		<p>Never, never go shopping or go to a restaurant or night club in a predominately Black neighborhood.  In fact, it is dangerous to even drive through such a neighborhood, even during the day.  What if your car breaks down or if you get into a fender-bender?  </p>
<p>No, it is best to restrict your activities to safe White neighborhoods. </p>

<p><i>What happened last night, as we understand, it was a very isolated incident,&rdquo; said Geitner.</i></p>
<p><br>
Yes. Such incidents are isolated to those times when ghetto blacks with guns leave the house and go out someplace. </p>
<p>Which, if you think about it, must be pretty often. </p>
<p>As an aside, I thought Pittsburgh was supposed to be still pretty white and civilized? At least compared to Philly, no? VDare.com&rsquo;s Joe Guzzardi used to write a &#8220;Letter from Lodi, CA&#8221; until the Mexicanization of his home state drove him east to PA about 4 years ago. Mr. Guzzardi has been giving mostly glowing reviews of his new home, describing it as a big improvement (ethnically speaking) on CA&rsquo;s Central Valley. </p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on with these here &#8220;Light Up Night riots&#8221;? Does this mean even Pittsburgh is now &#8220;going bad&#8221; on us? </p>
<p>I sure hope not   &mdash;   because there aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of medium-sized-or-larger cities left in America that HAVEN&rsquo;T gone bad on us!</p>

		<p>Please watch the KDKA video.  An innocent white girl with red hair is attacked by a light skinned black female at 29 seconds into the video.  The question is how many other innocent whites were attacked that night or harassed? </p>
<p>I was down there that night and a group of blacks stood in front of our car not allowing us to proceed through the intersection.  They stood in front of our car staring us down until another individual ran through the intersection (I believe one of their friends), at that point with the loud honking of horns from other motorists who were also stranded in traffic, they decided to move on. After this we drove out of the area. </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t ever want to be stationary in a motor vehicle during a situation like this.  Remember always leave a safe distance between yourself and the car or the crowd in front of you. I unfortunately wasn&rsquo;t driving, but always be aware of your surroundings.  </p>
<p>In our car we could hear over the police scanner as officers described the situation as &#8220;mayhem.&#8221; Officers were instructed to go into the crowd in groups of six. All availabe units throughout the city were called in along with other departments. It reminded me of the movie &#8220;We Were Soldiers&#8221; where Col. Hal Moore calls a &#8220;broken arrow&#8221; requesting all available aircraft to protect his overrun position.  It was quite clear that all hell had broken loose as a caravan of 10 police cars passed our car headed to the troubled area.</p>
<p>According to the morning radio shows sporadic violence continued to flare throughout the evening in the downtown area. Later on that night windows were broken along Baum Boulevard in the East Liberty/Shadyside part of town. </p>
<p>Pretty much all the violence downtown that night emanated near the T Stop (&#8220;subway stop&#8221;) on Wood Street.  There have been many problems associated with this T Stop in the past.  Watch the related video for an instance of the problems. </p>

<p>People in Pittsburgh are angry about the situation, I don&rsquo;t how Pittsburgh relates to other cities in regard to these type of incidents, but this incident definitely struck a nerve. </p>

		<p>I notice how these articles both seem to hide more than they disclose. </p>
<p>Of course I don&rsquo;t expect them to report on the race of the rioters, although that much should be obvious to anybody with two brain cells to rub together. Yet the &#8220;root causes&#8221; of these riots, the pattern that they form along with all the other numerous riots and flash mobs that have taken place over the summer, and why upscale (meaning largely white) areas and events are being targeted &mdash; all these questions are mysteriously absent from these articles.</p>
<p>Imagine the reverse &mdash; imagine if whites rioted during, say, a black expo. How the media would be up in arms about that! Or say that two white teenagers painted a swastika on a black family&rsquo;s home. Oh what hand-wringing there would be in the media about what a pattern of racism and oppression it reveals! But when dozens or hundreds of blacks for no apparent reason riot for the umpteenth time in just a few months, it&rsquo;s treated like an ordinary crime story.</p>
<p>You can watch news coverage of the riot here: https://tinyurl.com/2dekug4  (This coverage is hilarious in light of the fact that all of the eyewitnesses interviewed are white while all of those being led away in handcuffs  are black. No doubt a clear case of police profiling!)</p>

		<p>Watch the video. It&rsquo;s just a rerun of Black violence against Whites just like the Flash Mobs in Philadelphia, or the Somali smack downs in the Twin Cities or all the other places that Afros inhabit. Where they inhabit they inhibit everyone elses lives. The reporters referred to &#8220;fights&#8221; but they aimed the cameras judiciously I suspect, in order to cover up the fact that the attacks were directed at Whites.<br>
It&rsquo;s never going to end until WE put an end to it; hopefully with Ballots but be prepared for other alternatives because it&rsquo;s gonna get worse.</p>

<p>SHe said it all. You&rsquo;ll see the White people start staying away from the city and soon the Bantu will rule the streets. I hope that mother siezes this &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; for her kids.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure the &#8220;juvenile&#8221; looks about 35 in his mugshot. Is &#8220;juvenile&#8221; the new code word to replace&#8221;youth&#8221;? When are they going to train those dogs to bite more effectively? What ever became of &#8220;BRUNO,KILL!&#8221;? <br>

		<p>The thing that strikes me about these articles is how bland they are. No mention at all of WHOM may be causing all the violence and chaos. You might think it was just a random act of fate, like getting hit by lightning. You really have to read between the lines. Political correctness has emasculated American journalism. </p>

		<p>They want suburbanites to drive downtown for this?  Has it occurred to the Pittsburgh city government that this is the sort of thing that caused whites to move to the suburbs in the first place?</p>
<p>As for the fellow who was found shot in the groin, it is overwhelmingly likely the wound was self-enflicted.  This is easy to do if one draws a pistol from one&rsquo;s waistband with one&rsquo;s finger inside the trigger-guard, and &#8220;gangstas&#8221; are notorious for their mediocre gun-handling skills and utter unconcern for firearms safety.</p>

That will NEVER happen but just let a White say something as innocuous as &#8220;what&rsquo;s wrong with these people?&#8221; IF he has a job he&rsquo;s fired and could be up on hate charges.</p>
<p>It will continue until White people have had enough and then the pot will boil over and when it does nothing will contain it. The most abused dog will eventually bite back.<br>

		<p>Every festivity that I would love to attend has been eliminated  from my life: ANY concert, professional baseball games, 4th of July fireworks/laser shows, Christmas tree lightings, etc. ALL due to the overwhelming largely black crowds who make having fun not only miserable, but deadly; the horrendous neighborhoods that venues are in just beg for violence against whites.

A Pox upon those who voted for him and another Pox upon those Republicans who didn&rsquo;t offer us a better choice than McCain.<br>
I also have the urge to go and to desecrate the graves of the slave owners who left us this legacy with which we have invested so much of our time, our treasure and our blood without any  verifiable results.</p>

		<p>As a side note:  I watched the TV video, and noticed that the reporting was done (of course)  by the standard black male/white female team. That&rsquo;s de rigueur nowadays!  With such a match-up could we hope to get any frank reporting on what this riot was all about?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a pity the left-wing white nincompoops, who babble nonstop about the joys of diversity and multiculturalism, can&rsquo;t be present up front and close when these charming people of color are expressing themselves in such  delightful ways. Said nincompoops are sadly missing out on the delightful multicultural learning experiences that they so earnestly seek to impose on the rest of us.</p>

		<p>As a &#8220;yinzer,&#8221; here&rsquo;s my rapidly devaluing 2 cents:</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t go downtown as much for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. Finding parking is difficult and costly downtown; not so much at malls<br>
2. Public transportation could be better<br>
2. The belief that downtown is not safe<br>
3. Homeless people panhandling/random crazies<br>
4. Lots of people work in the suburbs nowadays</p>
<p>Compared to bigger and same sized cities, Pgh. is relatively sane, although I have to wonder lately.</p>
<p>I am also thankful that PA has CCW and that our sizable population of hunters and outdoors types keeps the gun grabbers in check. I know I take advantage of CCW, especially downtown.</p>
<p>What Pittsburgh needs is a similar approach to that Giuliani took in NYC, namely cracking down on &#8220;quality of life&#8221; offenses and providing meaningful help to the homeless/mentally ill. FWIW, Pittsburgh&rsquo;s police chief is black.</p>

<p>And after the concert, likely held in a downtown symphony hall or opera house, one has to get back to their car, or onto a bus or subway to go home. At night. Downtown&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true that there are concerts and other mass gatherings of people where a white man or woman can have a good time in safety. A classical concert is one such venue. I recently attended a concert given by a Ukrainian orchestra, which was of course all Slavic, all Ukrainian, and all white. The crowd except for a smattering of black and Asian folks was all white, and everyone was well behaved. The fact that many people there were also religious had a lot to do with it too. There was no need for armed cops at every corner, just to direct traffic outside the church. The concert was of course excellent and the musicians and singers were thanked profusely by passerby for their performance, something you will never see at a rap concert. Then I was able to escort my elderly mother and two of her friends to my car without ne&rsquo;r do well non-whites to wade through. It seems if alcohol, loose women, drugs and other things that draw non-whites like iron filings to a magnet are not there, one can actually have an enjoyable evening without the misery and dangers of diversity.</p>

		<p>When are concerts, recitals, opera, ballet, etc. going to come under fire (like national parks) as being  &#8220;not diverse enough&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, well, something will have to be done about this.</p>
<p>When the word gets out that this is an unclosed loophole, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.  (Can&rsquo;t allow whitey to have any loopholes to escape diversity!  Unmixed gatherings of whites are intrinsically dangerous!  Mustn&rsquo;t have that!)</p>
