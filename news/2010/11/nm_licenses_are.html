<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attracted by a 2003 law, people from all over the world are traveling to New Mexico to obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses because the state doesn&rsquo;t require proof of citizenship or legal residency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shu Sheng Lui told a state police officer Wednesday she had flown to Albuquerque from Missouri and paid a man $500 to help her get a New Mexico driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>Lui, 33, along with Hiew Fongyee, 31, and Lam Fong Siu, 44, were arrested at a state Motor Vehicle Division office in Albuquerque&rsquo;s south valley after they tried to obtain licenses using forged residency documents.</p>
<p>According to criminal complaints, the Chinese nationals had paid 22-year-old Gordon Leong for forged documents showing they live in New Mexico so they could obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New Mexico residents have generally opposed the state&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license law, according to a recent Albuquerque Journal poll that found that 67 percent of residents are against it.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Gov.-elect Susana Martinez pledged that she would work to revoke licenses issued to foreign nationals under the law.</p>

		<p>This is one of those stories that don&rsquo;t make a bit of sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP)  &mdash;  Attracted by a 2003 law, people from all over the world are traveling to New Mexico to obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses because the state doesn&rsquo;t require proof of citizenship or legal residency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows that we have a good process in place that is meant to detect any fraud or anyone trying to get a license without proper documentation,&#8221; MVD spokesman S.U. Mahesh said.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they  don&rsquo;t &#8220;require proof of citizenship or legal residency,&#8221; then what other proper documentation is required?</p>

I don&rsquo;t want to get into an issue of states right but really, aren&rsquo;t there any uniform federal standards?</p>
<p>No one in the federal government in the age of terrorism sees this as a national security issue?</p>

		<p>You can bet the same government that has illegals on the road, and social workers working find ways to keep illegals on the road, regardless, you can bet they find no problems in keeping white drunk drivers and speeders off the road. </p>

		<p>So I guess the state of New Mexico wants as many illegals as possible.<br>
Let them.<br>
Atzlan(as the Third Worlders call it) is theirs by default. The government refuses to stop it.</p>

		<p> &#8220;[They] were arrested after they tried to obtain licenses using forged residency documents.&#8221;</p>

Sorry,  I don&rsquo;t get this at all. How were they arrested for using &#8220;forged residency documents&#8221; when no proof of residency is required? </p>

		<p>That sure is great news. I know that it is a burden being illegal. Coming to a country without permission and using up that country&rsquo;s resources. So anything like this to help illegals out is a great thing. After all, it is not called NEW Mexico for nothing. Makes perfect sense. </p>

		<p>The best thing to do is stay out of New Mexico. This type of change is only the beginning for the mestizo take over of the southwest. Let them have it. But mark my words, it will never be enough. Everywhere I go I see more and more mexicans, on the East Coast!!</p>

		<p>@1,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing:</p>
<p>Proof of citizenship or residency = birth certificate or green card.</p>
<p>Proof of New Mexico residency = utility bill, library card or college ID.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also told that, thanks to recent compromises of various armed forces and state level (missing laptops etc.) systems, the Social Security Database is completely worthless, I know my own number had another person on it when I last went to establish a bank account.</p>
<p>So if you have &#8216;someone&rsquo;s&rsquo; SS# and proof of state residency&hellip;</p>

		<p>I met a couple of illegals from NM: one was from Mexico and the other from Germany!  They were operating a school furniture business: most likely with minority Gov grant.  I think other states who incur accidents  from NM drivers may want to consider law suits for damages.   V</p>
