<h1>&#8216;Arizona Style&rsquo; Immigration Law Proposed in Texas</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Forsyth, WOAI-AM (San Antonio), November 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Less than an hour after the period began for filing bills for consideration in the 2011 Legislative session, State Rep. Debbie Riddle (R-Tomball), a leader of the newly muscular conservatives in the Legislature, filed an &#8216;Arizona style&rsquo; measure that would crack down on illegal immigration, 1200 WOAI news reports.</p>
<p>Riddle says her measure is a response to what she says is the escalating violence caused by Mexican and Latin American gangs in Texas. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is absolutely out of control with the gang related crime, which is going through the roof, so, yes, we are addressing this, and quite frankly, I am not worried about political correctness,&#8221; Riddle told 1200 WOAI news.</p>
<p>The measure would be similar to Arizona&rsquo;s controversial SB 1070, in that it would require that local police work with federal immigration officials in determining the legal status of a person who is in their custody. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans will hold 99 of the 150 seats in the Texas House when the biennial session is gaveled into order January 11th, the largest GOP majority in the Texas House in 140 years. The conservative landslide last week is expected to result in several measures on the conservative wish list which have been killed by Democrats and moderate Republicans being passed in the coming legislature.</p>
<p>Riddle&rsquo;s measure would also deny all state funds to any community which declares itself a &#8216;sanctuary city&rsquo; and refuses to aggressively enforce immigration laws. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the healthy majority in the Texas House, Republcians will still control almost 2/3 of the seats in the 31 member State Senate, as well as Republicans in control of all statewide elected offices. But despite their healthy majority, Democrats like State Rep. Mike Villarreal (D-San Antonio) say they&rsquo;ll fight Riddle&rsquo;s propsoal.</p>

		<p>Since Republicans hold almost 2/3 of the State House and Senate, they better hope that all Republicans are united and they can pick off a few Democrats.  Rick Perry has already promised to veto, as he has been against laws like SB 1070 for quite some time.  He was lucky that the SB 1070 debate broke out after the Republican primary for TX-GOV between he, KBH and Debra Medina   &mdash;   Since KBH was for E-Verify, while Perry and Media were against, I could imagine KBH could have made some inroads if that primary were a month later.</p>

		<p>I am Davey Crockett, and I did not surrender to the Mexicans and beg for may life, as you may have learned in school.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe the Texans are serious about this law.  They will do nothing that will push Obama to pull an Eisenhower and use nationalized State Guardsman to protect the &#8220;civil rights and human dignity&#8221; of the undocumented workers who are only here to help America to become a true version of its lived out universal values.<br>

		<p>Whites need to make opposition to immigration an essential part of their politics.</p>
<p>Opposition to illegal immigration should be a priority in deciding who to support in elections.</p>

		<p>The civil war in mexico is VERY close to spilling over the texas border.  Just last week, in an incident that killed dozens of soldiers, it almost did exactly that.</p>
<p>After that happens, it won&rsquo;t matter what a politicians opinion on &#8220;immigration&#8221; is.  We aren&rsquo;t going to be allowed the luxury of tolerance anymore.</p>

		<p>If this gets any traction whatsoever, you can expect all the alphabet groups, along with their media comrades to conduct a full frontal propaganda and public relations assault.  Meanwhile, even if someone brings this up to John Q Public, he will pretend that he didn&rsquo;t hear about it and turn away to discuss the latest football game.  It just won&rsquo;t matter to them until Juan and Julio are on their front lawn stealing their mower or molesting their kids.</p>

		<p>Davey Crockett&rsquo;s Ghost you are a freak. The people keep speaking with legislative endeavors like this but SB 1070 has been undermined by judicial review. This will happen in Texas as will. </p>
<p>It happened in 1957 when whites lost their schools and it will happen here. The glimmer of hope is that people are waking up to the fact that if voting made any difference they wouldn&rsquo;t let you do it. The power of the judiciary needs to be greatly curtailed. The will of the people needs to be paramount in all matters. I am not talking about the barbaric hordes either I am speaking of the white founding stock. </p>

		<p>Defunding sanctuary cites is extremely important if we are going to get rid of our illegal alien problem.  Cities such as San Francisco will simultaneously be demanding federal money on one hand while passing it out hand over fist to illegals.  My guess is that when push comes to shove, the liberals will dump the illegals like a sack of garbage. </p>

		<p> Sancuary cities will be determined by their need (Availability of illegals) and they will safely stop the illegals in cities that don&rsquo;t have any.lol</p>
