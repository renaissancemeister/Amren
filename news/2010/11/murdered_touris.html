			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News24, Nov. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Speaking to UK tabloid The Sun, Briton Shrien Dewani, 31, revealed on Monday that his Swedish wife said she wanted a change from the &#8220;safe&#8221; region around their hotel, Cape Town&rsquo;s luxury Cape Grace, where they were staying for their honeymoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had never been to Africa before, so she suggested that we should have a look at the &#8216;real Africa&rsquo;,&#8221; Dewani told the newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anni grew up in Sweden, and she felt as if the area around the hotel was like at home, so clean and safe, and maybe a bit sterile.</p>
<p>According to The Sun, Anni was killed by a bullet which had severed an artery. She is also believed to have been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Township tourist hotspot</p>
<p>The couple are believed to have been heading to township tourist hotspot Mzoli&rsquo;s Meat in Gugulethu at about 23:00 on Saturday night.</p>
<p>But an employee of Mzoli&rsquo;s told News24 that they close at 19:00 every day. </p>
<p>Thabo Mbilatshwa of tour company Direct Action Centre for Peace and Memory said this is because even the owner of Mzoli&rsquo;s is aware of the dangers in Gugulethu at night.</p>
<p>The restaurant was recommended by UK celebrity chef Jamie Oliver in his magazine last year, when he described the food as &#8220;heaven&#8221; and &#8220;totally sexy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The couple were travelling in a shuttle car with a driver when they were stopped at traffic lights by two hijackers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The men kept saying, &#8216;We are not going to hurt you. We just want the car&rsquo;. That was a lie,&#8221; Dewani told The Sun.</p>
<p>The attackers then dumped their driver and drove off with the couple.</p>
<p>&#8216;We begged them to let us go&rsquo;</p>
<p>He and Anni apparently begged their attackers to dump them together, but after about 20 minutes Shrien ended up being pushed out of the car.</p>
<p>Anni&rsquo;s bloody body was later found in the car, which was in Khayelitsha.</p>
<p>Shrien said: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to go into detail about what happened during the attack, because I will probably start crying. But they were so cold. They put a gun in my ear and pulled back the trigger  &mdash;  it really was the stuff of movies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the conversation was us pleading to be dumped together. I held on to Anni as I said to them &#8216;Look, if you&rsquo;re not going to hurt her, let us go&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Western Cape Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz said that police are close to catching the killers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found positive forensic evidence in the car and we know exactly who the person is,&#8221; Fritz said.</p>

		<p>I looked at the picture but saw nobody Swedish. At any rate people are always being incautious while on trips away from home. Tourists regularly get out of cars and approach bears and other wildlife in order to get close up photos and endanger themselves in the process. Same applies in this case or in parts of the USA. For one&rsquo;s own safety keep your distance.   </p>

This is what Jesse Jackson has to say about the subject: &#8220;There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery   &mdash;   then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Maybe clean and safe like home isn&rsquo;t so bad after all. The only bright spot in this article is the picture, which reveals that the murdered woman wasn&rsquo;t a real Swede, but a member of the immigrant horde that Sweden could do just fine without.</p>

		<p>They should have made their move to escape come what may when the driver was thrown out. Better a bullet in the back than torture and death brought on by a lack of resolve. They must have recognized the danger.<br>
 On a related note, I tell my better half that the only time I will  overrule her harshly and aggressively is when I think that we or she is in physical danger. For me this process would have started before leaving for the airport. I would have torn up her thousand dollar ticket to Africa and then flushed it and our money down the toilet. Or thrown her suitcases out the window on the way to the airport. Anything to keep her from getting on that plane. If she wants to leave me thats fine by me. But we and her are NOT going period as long as I am a part of that relationship&hellip;</p>

		<p>Just another one of the reasons we fled SA in 1999.  This type of crime never happened when Apartheid was the system because even the blacks who are suffering from extreme crime more than any others as far as numbers are concerned (there are many more of them)were far safer then, except of course from the African National Congress terrorist killers who would threaten and publicly kill blacks (necklacing, etc) to &#8220;encourage&#8221; them all to join the fight for &#8220;freedom&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
This is just another crime that the liberals should feel guilty for but never will.</p>

What kind of name is Shrien Dewani?<br>
They could have chosen a nicer, safer place to holiday though, geez.</p>

		<p>The woman, Anni was Indian. The article that Amren poster InBalto provided in his link, says she grew up in Sweden.</p>
<p>Terrible crime, but maybe Anni grew up believing in Gunnar Myrdahl&rsquo;s book more than a Christian believes in the Bible. That was her downfall. Or maybe, she watched &#8220;Daktari&#8221; on Swedish cable TV, and thought that was the real Africa.</p>

		<p>This is really sad.  It just goes to show what an awful, dangerous place post-Apartheid South AFrica has become.  Dangerous, not just for the Afrikaners and British South Africans, but for everyone, even the coloured natives, and even tourists, it now seems.</p>
<p>It is irritating that they referred to them as &#8220;British&#8221; and &#8220;Swedish,&#8221; however.</p>
<p>I will say that even I, a racialist, was very loose and arrogant when I traveled to a third world country for the first time.  I went with relatives to Acapulco, a resort town long past its prime and now visited mostly by Mexicans, stayed in hotel with not a single American in it, walked around well after hours, and ventured into the really poor and gritty areas where little Mexican children yell &#8220;Chic-lay! Chic-lay!&#8221;  JUst recently, a whole group of tourists were kidnapped and killed in Acapulco. Oh, and guess when we went?  Last summer, when the drug wars were really heating up south of the border.  So, I can&rsquo;t really blame them for taking risks and wanting to see deepest, darkest Africa.  I would have strayed from the safe white areas too, if I were visiting an exotic land such as South Africa.</p>

<p>You are quite right. And I didn&rsquo;t see (in him) anybody &#8220;British&#8221; either. </p>
<p>I suspect they are both hybrids already, of sorts. The products of our Brave New World.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s possible that she could be Swedish, or part-Swedish,  though I see nothing recognizably &#8220;Swedish&#8221; in her face. But a stroll through downtown Stockholm will show you rather few faces that look typically &#8220;Swedish&#8221;  (as we expect them).  And a ride on the Stockholm subway, will show you even fewer. But Third World everywhere.  That is the way it is in Sweden today.</p>
<p>And ditto, but worse, in London!</p>

<p>I suppose safe and &#8216;sterile&rsquo; are euphemisms for &#8216;too white&rsquo;. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like safe and &#8216;sterile&rsquo; are free to live in any non-white, non-western country or community.</p>

		<p>These two were Indians, and in this cuntry they don&rsquo;t get attacked as much as the whites. The world&rsquo;s MSM has made such a fuss about the murder of this woman, but not a word has been printed in the MSM about the approximately 4000 white Boers that have been brutally and savagely murdered.  Since the take-over of this cuntry by the communists and savages, more than 40,000 whites have been brutally murdered and the MSM is completely hushed. Whites are literally living in a war zone and on borrowed time.</p>

		<p>OK, let me say it: &#8220;Would this have happened under apartheid?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was in South Africa back in the 1980s, the police were pretty blunt in telling me where the go and no-go areas where. And while crime was high, there was always a sense of order. Streets in the cities were clean, people were polite (even if they hated each other).   <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<i><br>
&ldquo;Anni grew up in Sweden, and she felt as if the area around the hotel was like at home, so clean and safe, and maybe a bit sterile.</i></p>
<p>One has to wonder if her vision of post-apartheid SA was influenced by the anti-apartheid policies and propaganda of Sweden. Thing is, I know too many people who believe now that apartheid is gone, South Africa is some kind of rainbow multicultural paradise. This couple got an education, too late. But one wonders how many more innocent people like this will be sent to the slaughter in newSA because of the delusions perpetuated by Western liberal media, governments, schools, et alia? </p>

		<p>In today&rsquo;s Western World it makes perfect sense to report that they are from &#8220;Sweden&#8221;, while clearly they are Indian. So much for reality, but in this case&hellip;&hellip;. they certainly found the true reality.</p>

<p>  So we have a Briton and a Swede here? If this is the future of both countries, I really don&rsquo;t see much hope for the continuance of traditional folkways in either country. Unfortunately, the woman was the victim of the same multicultural propaganda imperative that allowed her to become &#8220;Swedish&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s common knowledge that South Africa is one of the most dangerous places in the world right now. Why anyone would choose to go there on their honeymoon is beyond comprehension. I suspect this young Asian couple (from Western European nations) had grown up with typical leftist European acceptance of notions about &#8220;diversity&#8221; and all races being the same. This case is such a tragedy that really didn&rsquo;t have to happen. Teach your children the importance of recongnizing and avoiding dangerous people and places. I&rsquo;m not just picking on South Africa. I give the same warnings about American cities like Detroit and Chicago. You just don&rsquo;t go there unless you absolutely have to. And if you have to, then go prepared, as though there is a real possibility that you may have to fight for your life.</p>

		<p>The couple are East Indians with British and Swedish citizenship, indoctrinated by the liberal education systems of their respective host countries. The girl is very pretty!  Physically speaking, East Indians are of a delicate build, no match for the much more powerful Africans. I wonder whether a white English-Swedish couple  would have suffered the same fate given that whites are much stronger and more masculine that East Indians and wouldn&rsquo;t have gone down without a fight&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Pertaining to the disingenuous   &mdash;   <i>nationality angle</i>   &mdash;   of this story, the key wording is she &#8220;grew up in Sweden&#8221; implying that the murdered woman was possibly born in another country. If so, why not reveal her birthplace in the original story, or are the multi-cults still plying their game at the expense of this murdered woman? Perhaps news editors wrongly assumed the public wouldn&rsquo;t question national origins during this sensitive time in this couple&rsquo;s lives.  </p>

<p>Many posters have complained about these two not being ethnically Swedish or English, and that is true. But they must have become psychologically and culturally European, or they would never have done something as suicidal as to &#8220;go looking for the real Africa.&#8221; </p>
<p>Because back in their old country   &mdash;   India or the Middle East or wherever these two were from, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter   &mdash;   light-brownish people like them all have an implicit understanding that blacks are NOT desirable company. As a rule, both East Indians and Arabs HATE Africans with a ferocity that would never get past the AmRen moderator. A real Hindu or a real Arab would never have taken such a foolish risk as this unfortunate couple did. The only brown people who voluntarily seek out black people are brown people who have been brainwashed by white people. </p>
<p>So these two are, in their way, victims of the Marxist Multikult just like we are. </p>

		<p>Sub Saharan Africa is a dreadful place to go for a honeymoon. The only people who should travel there should be anthropologists and archaeologists who wish to study our primitive origins, sociologists who want to learn about failed societies, and businessmen looking for opportunities to exploit the natural resources of the continent.

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for Arabs, but I have known well-educated professional blacks who completely disdain and dislike East Indians, and this goes back decades.  I concluded from various conversations that this was related to the built-in Indian cultural strata, where darker means more inferior.  Their culture is very hierarchical.  My admittedly limited experience with East Indians in the U.S. leads me to believe that they generally respect and like white Americans, at least where they are subordinate.</p>

		<p>If they are a Hindu or Muslim couple, I wonder if this was an arranged marriage? Apparently, the husband was released by the captors but the wife was murdered. I don&rsquo;t mean to be cruel, but perhaps this was a spousal killing arranged to look like a murder.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the deceased young Hindu bride would still be alive if her husband was really English (by which I mean White). The &#8220;British Indian&#8221; husband seemed to be a little too deferential (a typical Indian trait) under the circumstances by allowing himself to be offloaded while she was still in the car. Pleading with assailants only encourages the worst kind of violence. The husband behaved pathetically&hellip;</p>
<p>That said my heart goes out to the bride and her family. A beautiful young woman murdered at the prime of her life cannot be anything but tragic. I sincerely wish that she is  now at peace in a much  better place</p>

<p>Regardless, being of mixed race like that, it makes them even more susceptible to we-are-the-world foolishness, since it&rsquo;s literally in their genes.

<p>The bus driver wasn&rsquo;t armed, because South Africa has strict gun laws; much like New York City&rsquo;s or Cuba&rsquo;s. Among other things, a person applying for a gun permit, must prove they are mentally sound, and have a need for a gun, other than &#8220;self-defense&#8221;; to the satisfaction of police officials.</p>

There are quite a few rumours abounding that this was a paid hit for insurance purposes   &mdash;   the husband being the beneficiary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Western Cape Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz said that police are close to catching the killers.<br>
&ldquo;We have found positive forensic evidence in the car and we know exactly who the person is,&rdquo; Fritz said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fritz, like most of the thoroughly demotivated and corrupt S.A.P.S doesn&rsquo;t have a clue.  The only way the truth will come out is if private investigators are consulted.</p>

There are many holes in the statement of the husband who got dumped from the car unscathed.As SA investigators admit there are many holes in the whole story and foreigners may have been involved in the crime.We may be in for a shocking revelation.

<p>I&rsquo;m Indian and I do think that my natural tan complexion protects me from extremists in the often nasty and vitriolic black-white divide. After all, why would blacks harbor any animosity against a group that never exploited them? Or whites begrudge a community that doesn&rsquo;t depend on taxpayer programs to get ahead? And to be fair, the Indian experience with both blacks and whites in contemporary society is largely positive. An isolated incident like the Derwani attack doesn&rsquo;t change the big picture.</p>
<p>That said, isolated or not, the loss of a beautiful young woman in the prime of her life is indeed tragic. As much as my heart goes out to the family, I think the tragedy will be compounded if my fellow Indians started viewing all Africans in a negative manner as a result of one incident. </p>

You are so right! I&rsquo;ve observed the savage behavior of these humanoids over the years and it&rsquo;s a testament to the failure of decades of social programs and billions; possibly trillions of dollars spent on them in fruitless attempts to educate and to civilize them. The greatest cost has been the expenditure of our blood in the ever increading violence being visited on us by them. This society is a cauldron that will soon boil over and there will be retribution. Everytime I see Anni&rsquo;s picture I experience this terrible rage. IF I could get to those who shot her I&rsquo;d kill them myself slowly and painfully. They have a need to defile and destroy what is beautiful whether it be people or things because they&rsquo;re so ugly both inwardly and outwardly.</p>

<p>I was in Kenya and Uganda at the time when the &#8220;Asians&#8221;  were undergoing persecution,   just before their expulsion.

		<p>One article quotes the husband: &#8216;Of course I have an enormous amount of guilt about the whole episode,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;However, having gone through events over and over again in my mind, it is difficult to see how we could have done things differently.&rsquo;<br>
&#8216;Doing things differently&#8221; would be NOT taking your wife to South Africa.  Doing so puts the murder on his shoulders completely.  Were he a Real Man, he would have loved and protected her enough to NOT take her to South Africa!  I thought only Americans were so stupid to go there just to get raped and murdered.<br>
One strange thing:  This restaurant they went to was featured in a magazine and it&rsquo;s a popular tourist attraction.  So if the tourist attractions are not safe in South Africa, nothing is safe there. </p>
<p>As far as Prince William and his soon to be wife going to Africa-they are not going to be walking the streets alone, taking taxis or hired cars, and are not going to South Africa!  The prince has a friend who owns a lot of land somewhere in Africa and they also have traveled to a resort in Kenya.  Not the typical stupid visitors to South Africa, the country with the most rapes and the highest HIV rate. </p>
<p>Actually, it is funny, but I have known several blacks who have gone to Africa-it is very trendy for them to go there.  But none will set foot in South Africa even!  They also go to places like Kenya. </p>
<p>It is pretty bad that this country that was &#8216;civilized&rsquo; by whites is now worse than other parts of Africa.  I wonder why the white influence has not been better in terms of deterring crime.  The Arabs have done a much better job in Northern Africa.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m right there with you Anonymous #55. He obviously thought that Anni was an ethnic Swede when he used that term but to abandon what should be our human compassion makes us no better than those whom we criticize. The Scandinavians like so many other Europeans have a tendency toward Liberalism because until the last decade, they never had up close and personal experience with the Third World. All they knew about Africans  and Muslims was what they learned in their educational systems that were staffed by the same wild eyed leftist fanatics who have dominated our educational system for the last six decades. It&rsquo;s ingrained in them. </p>
<p> While in Spain in the 80s I was astounded by what some of the Spaniards believed about the US and the cruelty that Whites inflicted on Blacks. I found similar reactions in France and also, surprise, in Belgium.</p>
<p>Anni Dewani was a product of this same delusional image of Black culture.</p>

		<p> &#8220;I wonder why the white influence has not been better in terms of deterring crime. The Arabs have done a much better job in Northern Africa.&#8221;</p>

The Arabs do not put up with any sort of black nonsense. They also do not labor under any sense of guilt or obligation to make restitution. Affirmative action would be considered a bad joke there.</p>

<p>In all fairness, there were times in US history that certain whites did in fact  inflict appalling levels of cruelty on blacks (think slavery, lynchings, Jim Crow). To deny that would be dillusional. The issue is whether whites today can be held responsible for that unfortunate period in our history, especially after genuine attempts at restitution on the part of the Federal government.  Furthermore, ancestors of the majority of the white population of today had no involvement in the enslavement of blacks. Accordingly, hostile behavior towards whites and in the case of Anni, Indians on the part of blacks seems puerile and misdirected. </p>
