			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eugene Kane, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Nov. 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Milwaukee educator Taki Raton sees the problem with failing black students in very stark terms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Black people are the only ones who can teach black children, it&rsquo;s as simple as that,&#8221; he told me, in no uncertain tones.</p>
<p>Raton, currently a writer and lecturer who runs an educational consulting firm, also founded Blyden Delany Academy, a well-respected private school, which operated under Milwaukee&rsquo;s choice program for 10 years. Raton closed the school a few years ago because of financial concerns, but while Blyden Delany was open, it was consistently praised by black parents in Milwaukee with children enrolled in the institution.</p>
<p>Raton doesn&rsquo;t think that was anything out of the ordinary. Blyden Delany was African-centered  &mdash;  some call it Afrocentric  &mdash;  in its approach to teaching black students. Raton and a legion of similarly minded black educators in Milwaukee and across the nation believe that distinction makes all the difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know what we&rsquo;re doing,&#8221; he said, referring to African-centered schools in general. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t have the kind of problems other schools have because we&rsquo;re following a classical model for African-centered education.&#8221;</p>
<p>The basic model, developed by black educators and activists, is a simple one that has often created controversy when proposed for a traditional public school system.</p>
<p>It goes like this: All black staff, all black student body, and all black school board.</p>
<p>More important, Raton said, the entire curriculum was based on African principles that are considered part and parcel of a framework taught to all students. As a result, African-centered schools have higher graduation rates, fewer discipline problems and more respect for education than other schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most African-centered curricula focus on teaching students principles such as self-esteem, civility, responsible citizenship and other values said to be taken from a classical view of traditional African society. The schools also use African-American history to provide cultural and academic information to students to help them to understand their role in society as young black Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like many African-Americans who remember all black schools before court-ordered desegregated plans, Raton believes the education of black children began to suffer after they were bused to predominantly white schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout history, people have always stayed with their own kind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The bottom line is we are not all the same. Black children are not going to grow up and be white.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agree.  I don&rsquo;t think non-whites can teach white students in white subjects, like STEM.  If this guy is going to be consistant, he can have all the black students and african subjects.  But stay out of ours.  </p>

		<p>This formula all sounds so pat and logical except for one major factor:  Africa itself has no original academic standards, no written languages, no written history, no science, no developments in math, recorded history, and no social development above that of the local village.  Everything we can teach black Africans to allow their socialization within our Euro-centric culture originated with us and our forebears.</p>
<p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>

		<p><i>As a result, African-centered schools have higher graduation rates, fewer discipline problems and more respect for education than other schools.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Higher graduation rates.&#8221;  The school must hand out diplomas like candy and never fail any of its students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fewer discipline problems.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m sure a lot of their &#8220;discipline problems&#8221; are covered up behind one bureaucratic euphemism or another.  If not, that school is private, so it can kick out students at the first sign of troublemaking, therefore the students they have remaining will be relatively disciplined.  Public schools don&rsquo;t have that luxury to bounce out troublemakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;More respect for education.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s subjective, and therefore, it really can&rsquo;t be supported or rebuked with evidence.</p>

		<p>I must say that I agree with his main point that people generally do stick with their own kind.  I would LOVE to hear the response of a white liberal to that clarion call for racial segregation from a BLACK man.  Of course, the liberals won&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>I do believe people of different races can get along and even live amongst each other, as long as they all subscribe to a dominant cultural pattern.  That&rsquo;s why middle class asians, latinos and even blacks can live in white middle class neighborhoods and not cause much of a fuss.  Everyone follows the dominant culture, more or less.</p>
<p>The problem is when you get one rising minority group pushing their &#8216;racial agenda&rsquo; which automatically is exclusive and isolating.  Or when a lot of people come in with vastly different cultural values.  Irish and Italian immigrants were white, but white Americans were very wary of them and avoided them based on the perception that they were low-class.</p>
<p>To add race along with a perception like that makes integration impossible.  This is what liberals don&rsquo;t (or won&rsquo;t) understand.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that white Americans object to a non-white per se, but that if that non-white comes with major cultural differences, it is a threat to the cohesion of the community.  This has been a constant in human history for as long as we have records.  An &#8216;outsider&rsquo; has different &#8216;values.&rsquo;  (See the Bowling Alone book, for example)</p>
<p>The liberals seem to think that any &#8216;ol black or brown person can be picked up and plunked down in white suburbia and fit in s if they are merely interchangeable.  (I don&rsquo;t consider a white trash person an acceptable neighbor just because they&rsquo;re white, and I can speak with authority growing up around it.)</p>
<p>I do take exception to an afrocentric curriculum if white kids are forced to learn it, but if it&rsquo;s only for blacks, well, then my kids can have a euro-centric, traditional American education with white teachers.  Fair is Fair.</p>

<p>No, but they&rsquo;re still going to have to try to function in a White world. Good luck doing that after they&rsquo;ve been taught the &#8220;black way&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This scheme of black education being run as a form of therapy should be entirely financed by them. Black schools, black teachers, black financing, that would be &#8220;keepin it real&#8221;, as the saying goes. However, I get the suspicion that this fast talker is looking for financing via some foundations or the government. Experience tells me that exaggerated self-pride usually doesn&rsquo;t extend all the way to actually paying for it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;All black staff, all black student body, and all black school board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this segregation, the evil separation of the races that was the normal practice back in 1950?  That was 60 years ago, back in the &#8220;bad-days&#8221; when black crime, drug use, arrests, divorce, and out-of-wedlock children were at extremely low levels, compared to today, and after integration, Affirmative Action, Welfare, and the War of Poverty.</p>

<p>Fair enough but would he grant this right to whites as well? Does he want white and non-black taxpayers to pay for his school?</p>
<p>I also doubt these students do that much better than blacks in public school.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Clearly not.</p>
<p>I do wonder if this guy was a &#8216;ten percenter&rsquo; or took in anyone with money?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;Throughout history, people have always stayed with their own kind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The bottom line is we are not all the same. Black children are not going to grow up and be white.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>What exactly does that mean, may I ask?  Do you reject the businesses, institutions and cultural highlights of 800 years of &#8216;whiteness&rsquo; to include non-African sports, medicine, technology and economics models?</p>
<p>Or do you simply put forward the notion that when a black graduates, he or she will automatically inherit SES, not just in and of his &#8216;black skills&rsquo; but via those choose to deal with his almighty blackness?</p>
<p>I think this is the greatest fraud perpetrated on blacks, by other blacks as &#8216;African Culture&rsquo;, even as a minority group in a larger, successful population, _fails_ to create economic opportunities and social norms which could encourage and expand this sense of black unity to true independent standing.</p>
<p>Someone who comes out of an all-black, all the time, educational system is going to hit a world where his top ten percent IQ is still nothing great and which doesn&rsquo;t care about his/her history.  And doesn&rsquo;t like his/her attitudes that the rest of society should be aware of their special past because they are.</p>
<p>What saddens me is the hypocrisy by which this man operates.  He states a desire to see blacks educated which clearly most blacks do not share.  Presupposing that a -necessity- for education at all amounts to admitting that the usefulness of such education (as change, in the base population) is &#8216;something not black&rsquo; i.e. white.</p>
<p>And his ideas of separation in class and subjects do not extend to proveable formula for a separation of useful skills in the extant society where the jobs are.</p>
<p>In this, he clearly is not making the connective link that if a mean IQ 87 subgroup (that is 12% of an overall society whose mean IQ is 100) includes a 2.5% Bell Curve upper class hierarchy whose 100-115 IQ makes them eligible for the kinds of jobs that would give them a &#8216;white&rsquo; standard of living, they form, overall less than .003 of the total working population and thus cannot expect to earn enough to support themselves, let alone elevate their communities alone.</p>
<p>If these racially aware and educated blacks _are not accepted_ by whites who don&rsquo;t want to associate with them, they will not find a broad enough wealth base to form their own peer based social norm.</p>
<p>And whites will not offer militant blacks anything.  Not as trickle down.  Not as reparations.  Not as entitlements.  Nearly 45 years of Great Society Guillt is enough.</p>

I guess the Liberals were right.  Blacks do have something they can teach Whites.<br>
On the other hand, graduates of the pseudo-African, anti-White, marxist academy still won&rsquo;t be able to read nor will they be employable.  At least not in the White private sector.</p>

		<p>Taki Raton: &#8220;Like many African-Americans who remember all black schools before court-ordered desegregated plans, Raton believes the education of black children began to suffer after they were bused to predominantly white schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>To reinforce Mr. Raton&rsquo;s point, below are excerpts from a review of The Price They Paid: Desegregation in an African American Community  (Vivian Gunn Morris and Curtis L. Morris, New York: Teachers College Press, 2002). The Price They Paid is a study of a black high school in Tuscumbia, Alabama, closed because of desegregation:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; desegregation policies disrupted a symbiotic relationship that once existed between the black community and black schools and educators &hellip; black people in Tuscumbia &hellip; felt the sting of racism &hellip; Yet &hellip; the African American community worked collectively to ensure that the school met the needs of black children and functioned in the overall interest of the black community. As elsewhere throughout the segregated South &hellip; the black people of Tuscumbia donated land to build the school, and offered their time and other resources. Moreover, while white policymakers and district leaders imposed a curriculum that reflected an industrial model [vocational education] &hellip; the school leaders at Trenholm High School resisted this imposition, and embraced the classical or liberal educational model.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Unlike many scholarly accounts of segregated black schooling, which focus on the disparities in resources between black and white schools, this account of a black school community focuses on black agency in the midst of legalized racial apartheid &hellip; Like many black schools of its day, Trenholm played an integral role in the black community. Black educators created opportunities for black children to display their talents, leadership, and speaking abilities, and also imparted a sense of responsibility to the children &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the experience of at least two other black educators with whom I spoke each from a different black communities.  But there story was definitely not a one the newspapers and broadcast media of the 70s and 80s wanted to tell. There was a different agenda in play   &mdash;  - the busing mania   &mdash;  - and they would push it for all they were worth. </p>

		<p>Keep this in mind:  It was &#8220;conservatives&#8221; and &#8220;libertarians&#8221; who fought to keep and expand the Milwaukee school choice program and keep this bozo employed.  It was the Right, not the Left, who provided the legal expertise and money to enable black militant Polly Williams, the Jesse Jackson supporter behind this whole deal, to sue all the way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court   &mdash;   and win.  </p>
<p>Everyone who reads this piece should forward it to The Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Landmark Legal Foundation and all other Right-leaning think tanks who promoted this Afrocentrism masquerading as &#8220;school choice.&#8221;  This is their handiwork.  Thanks a lot guys.   </p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the kind of problems other schools have because we&rsquo;re following a classical model for African-centered education.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
A &#8220;classical model for African-centered education&rdquo;? Now what exactly would THAT be   &mdash;   in light of the fact that black Africa had NO education before Whitey showed up? And you mean to say that Africa had a Classical period? Really? When? Was it before or after they gave up cannibalism? </p>
<p>Of course, the entire continent of Africa also had no written languages   &mdash;   not one!   &mdash;   before Whitey showed up. No writing means no education. </p>
<p>So is THAT what this Taki Raton is offering his black students? &#8220;No education&#8221;?</p>
<p>If his &#8220;afrocentric&#8221; skool&rsquo;s focus is on such &#8220;soft&#8221;, nonintellectual, nonacademic subjects as &#8220;self-esteem, civility, responsible citizenship&#8221; and other such trendy nonsense, I would guess that &#8220;no education&#8221; is EXACTLY what Raton&rsquo;s kids are getting. </p>

		<p>In principle,I&rsquo;ve no problem with what the &#8220;Delany&#8221; school did. Race or nationality based education often works. The Jews and their thousands of years old system of communal education proves the point,although they have genetics on their side too.  However, what were the SAT or high school achievement scores of these schools compared with say, white Christian, Jewish day, or private schools? forget the publics, they are all a joke, white or black.</p>

		<p>Since integration/assimilation doesn&rsquo;t seem to have worked out for them here, how about the Afro-centrists go back to Africa to practice their Afro-centrism?</p>

		<p>Well, based on the curriculum described, they were learning nothing much useful, and had a lot of courses which would be graded subjectively&hellip;.in other words, show up, get an A.  I would assume that they would have had to comply with State mandated course work for high school graduation?  Or did they?  One wonders.  Moreover, entirely black run school closes due to financial problems?  What a surprise.  I wonder how much was transferred to private use of the board and teachers.  Be that as it may, I am all for re-segregation.  Let the blacks be with their own kind, and maybe OUR scores will again climb in newly all White schools.  OUR schools were most certainly become MUCH much safer almost immediately the blacks leave. Sounds fine to me!  </p>

<p>  &mdash;  Believe me, the education of EVERYONE began to suffer when blacks were bused to predominantly white school.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Black people are the only ones who can teach black children, it&rsquo;s as simple as that,&rsquo; he told me, in no uncertain tones.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  I sorta wonder if ANYONE can teach black children, but if that&rsquo;s how they feel more power to them. Let &#8216;em have their own schools and let us have ours.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;Throughout history, people have always stayed with their own kind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The bottom line is we are not all the same. Black children are not going to grow up and be white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Uhmmm, when we say that here on AMREN, doesn&rsquo;t that make us racists?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Most African-centered curricula focus on teaching students principles such as self-esteem, civility, responsible citizenship and other values said to be taken from a classical view of traditional African society.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Ah&hellip; Civility, responsible citizenship. All those principles so much in evidence in black-run Africa. Well, if it keeps them from raping, robbing, and assaulting white people, I&rsquo;m all for it. Reality is really gonna bite, though, when they get to college. Whites and Asians studying math and science, while blacks major in being black. Sounds like a prescription for delaying the hatred and resentment to early twenties rather than feeding it to them with their mother&rsquo;s milk. Just the same, if it keeps them away from us for awhile it can&rsquo;t be all bad. </p>

		<p>I remember seeing on the news George Wallace standing defiantly on the school steps attempting to preserve segregated education in the early 60&rsquo;s. Could it be we have come full circle? I have always felt that blacks were better off in the segregated South than they are today. They had more family life, moral and religious values,and sense of responsibility. They have digressed to moral decay, criminal savagry, and lack of responsibility prevalent in today&rsquo;s inner cities. They gained civil rights but lost civility. As the article states it is normal to gravitate to ones own kind. Also the grand social experiment to integrate into racial uniformity has clearly failed. The black race has digressed to a sad state of dispair and the White race is in danger of being denegrated by years of racial intermixing. Segregated schooling is best for all.</p>

Why all the fuss about these people having to grow up to not be white?

		<p>This is a proposal to open Afro-centric Charter Schools, financed with public, not private funds.  And he will get whatever he asks for.  </p>
<p>We have similar race-based, publicly-funded charter schools in LA, one of which teaches the Mayan Language and Mayan math, using base 20.</p>
<p>This is from the White-hating, mexican born principal:</p>
<p><i>We don&rsquo;t want to go to White schools. What we want to do is teach ourselves, teach our children the way we have of teaching. We don&rsquo;t want to drink from a White water fountain&hellip; the whole issue of segregation and the whole issue of the Civil Rights Movement is all within the box of White culture and White supremacy. </i></p>
<p>- Marcos Aguilar, founder and principal of La Academia Semillas del Pueblo (2006).</p>
<p>The LA school board recently re-affirmed the charter (and funding) of this racist, White-hating school.</p>
<p>john writes: </p>
<p><i>Africa itself has no original academic standards, no written languages, no written history, no science, no developments in math, recorded history, and no social development above that of the local village.</i></p>
<p>John, facts matter nothing to these people.  </p>
<p>Afro-centric curricula is part of the black grievance industry, fomenting hatred of Whites and White Civilization, as it ingrains into black children that black misery and poverty everywhere, including the entire continent of Africa, are the fault of Whites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been subjected in the past to some (torturous) Professional Development on afro-centric education.  It is centered around the &#8216;belief&rsquo; that Africa is The Birthplace of all learning and knowledge, stolen from blacks by Whites, starting way back with The Greeks and continuing into the present.</p>
<p>Afro-centrics teach that all discoveries and knowledge in &#8220;maths&#8221;, science, written language, history <i>all of it</i> were products of Africa and <i>stolen by Whites</i> who then denied Africans their true heritage, wiped out their civilizations, erased their history, burned their books and subsequently enslaved and oppressed them.</p>
<p>We may laugh at these kinds of teachings (I sit in the back, keep my head down and bury myself in the NY Times X-word to keep from laughing   &mdash;   or screaming). But to blacks, and the school district and the state and the government, it is all taken deadly seriously (to not do so would be racist).</p>
<p>Also, higher-functioning Larry Elder-type black teachers know &#8220;how their people are&#8221; (as one black substitute teacher told me recently) and are well aware that being assigned to a black school, Afro-centric or not, means dealing with daily fights, rude classroom behavior, dysfunctional families, abysmal test scores and is, a never-ending, constant daily headache.  </p>
<p>They know they can easily transfer to, quieter, better functioning schools in a heartbeat (unlike us White teachers) and do, ASAP.  Who could blame them for wanting a better, quieter workplace, accolades (and sometimes cash) for higher test scores, and parents that won&rsquo;t come in and defend the aberrant behavior of their little darling.</p>

<p>There was a SCOTUS decision in 1980 that specifically allowed for the tax exempt status of explicitly non-white schools but explicitly denied it to explicitly white schools.</p>
<p>As for this topic, of blacks and education, I want to bring up single gender education in black schools.  A suburban St. Louis high school is segregating by gender its &#8220;ninth grade academy&#8221; (those are also all the rave in black high schools, to &#8220;ease&#8221; the transition to that ultra-tough curriculum in the high school, something the elementary and middle schools these students attended didn&rsquo;t do).  </p>
<p>People keep telling us that we have to have schools whose classrooms are racially mixed very close to the demographics of the city which it serves, and some go so far as to say that the lunch room tables in those schools have to be the same way.  Their reasoning is that young people have to become acclimated to the same kind of racially diverse world that they will surely encounter as adults in the work place.  (That was back in the days when there was actually work available).  Whatever &ldquo;classroom distractions&rdquo; and impediments to &ldquo;ingraining academic achievement&rdquo; there were as a result of integrated schools, we just had to get used to them because diversity was so important.</p>
<p>Yet, gender diversity isn&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s concern in this instance.  And I can&rsquo;t understand why  &mdash;  While there are still some people left in America who will rarely encounter anyone outside their own race, virtually everybody will have daily contact with someone of another gender.  And virtually everyone who has a job will work with a lot of people of other genders.  (Not a grammatical error here  &mdash;  There are more than two genders, I realize that)  Our Betters should apply their own race logic to gender  &mdash;  If young men and young women who are high school freshmen, that would put them anywhere between 13 and 20 years old (we&rsquo;re talking about blacks, after all), can&rsquo;t learn in spite of the gender distraction, then they won&rsquo;t be able to work (just in case some of them ever do) in the same kind of mixed gender environment.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe what they&rsquo;re are driving at is that so many of the young black men they see at these ghetto high schools will wind up going to prison that they should get used to an environment without girls and women.</p>

<p>At the private, Afrocentric Blyden Delany Academy, the challenges of urban education are keenly felt.<br>
     The drab former church building with a peaked roof is more than a century old. A basement cafeteria is windowless and spare. But the walls are lined with bright posters on African history.<br>
     The students, kindergarten through eighth grade, nearly all receive vouchers. They are supposed to wear uniforms of yellow shirts, but so many have failed to do so of late that Raton, the principal, has cracked down. The result has been high rates of absenteeism as students without uniforms have stayed home, he said.<br>
     It&rsquo;s the sort of problem Raton didn&rsquo;t anticipate when he opened the school three years ago. Sitting in his office, surrounded by African masks, Raton recalled: &#8220;I had this ideal: an African American school &hellip; perfect nice little children happy to be in school that was all black with teachers who love them and high expectations &hellip; &#8221; He gave a short laugh. &#8220;Please.&#8221;<br>
     The first year, there was a lot of &#8220;gangster stuff,&#8221; he said. There were fights, kids who had to be restrained or who were openly defiant.<br>
     &#8220;It threw me for a loop,&#8221; Raton said. He hadn&rsquo;t planned on using suspensions or expulsions to discipline students, but he has come to see that it&rsquo;s necessary. Asked if he had ever used corporal punishment, Raton answered: &#8220;Not under the letter of the law.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Milwaukee educator Taki Raton sees the problem with failing black students in very stark terms.</i></p>
<p>And from Anon #57:</p>
<p><i>The first year, there was a lot of &#8216;gangster stuff,&rsquo; he said. There were fights, kids who had to be restrained or who were openly defiant. &#8216;It threw me for a loop&rsquo;, Raton said.</i> </p>
<p>LOL! </p>
<p>(and thanks for the very pertinent information #57)</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn&rsquo;t printed by in the <i>Milwaukee Urinal</i> (but should have been).  The impression the reader is given, from Mr. Raton himself:</p>
<p>We know what we&rsquo;re doing!</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the kind of problems other schools have! </p>
<p>African-centered schools have higher graduation rates, fewer discipline problems and more respect for education than other schools!</p>
<p>And from the article&rsquo;s author:</p>
<p>it was consistently praised by black parents in Milwaukee!</p>
<p>You can be sure Mr. Raton won&rsquo;t try this &#8216;experiment&rsquo; again. But, he will be looking for another job soon, probably as a consultant on &#8216;African American Educational Concerns&rsquo;   &mdash;   in a very White district.</p>

		<p>The only time (after the Egyptians and Phoencians) that Africa had a written language in operation was when the Arabs arrived and brought Arabic literacy to West Africa.  Finally the Europeans came and brought various European langages.  I always wondered how subSaharan Africa never developed a language of its own.  Even the Indian civilizations of Meso America had written language.</p>

		<p> If segregation is reinstated it will be for the blacks and other minorities that want it. Whites will not be allowed to have the same rights. Sep. 24, 1957,  Little Rock, Arkansas armed active duty combat soldiers were sent to enforce these laws and I believe it will happen again.</p>
<p> If I could have just one answer about this situation it would be to this question: What is the Federal Government so totally scared of from the white race?</p>
