<h1>Perfect Storm for GOP: Obama Base Stays Home, White Voters Defect</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ronald Brownstein, Yahoo News!, November 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The portions of the electorate that remained loyal to President Obama and Democrats  &mdash;  particularly minority voters and young people  &mdash;  did not show up in anywhere near the numbers they did in 2008. And among the voters who did show up, Democratic candidates suffered crippling defections among white voters, particularly independents, seniors, and those without a college education, according to the national network exit poll of House elections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Young people, who cast 18 percent of the ballots in 2008, dropped to just 11 percent. That was a slightly larger falloff than is typical in midterm elections. Likewise, the falloff between the minority share of the vote in 2008 and Tuesday night was the largest decline between a presidential and the subsequent midterm election in at least the past two decades. Two years ago, minorities cast 26 percent of all ballots in the presidential election; this year that number fell to 22 percent. Both groups largely stuck with Democrats  &mdash;  but their impact was severely diluted by their declining turnout.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, seniors, who represented one-sixth of voters in 2008, soared to fully 22 percent  &mdash;  their largest share since at least 1992. And nearly three-fifths of them backed Republican House candidates. Among white seniors, that number rose to over three-fifths.</p>
<p>Overall, the national exit poll measuring preferences in House races put the Republican vote among whites at a jaw-dropping 60 percent, up sharply from 53 percent in 2008. Democratic candidates attracted only about 35 percent of the vote among white men and women without a college education and college-educated white men. Following patterns evident in Obama&rsquo;s approval rating, the only segment of the white electorate that didn&rsquo;t collapse for Democrats were college-educated white women. But even they tilted slightly toward the GOP.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a geographic reflection of Obama&rsquo;s weakness among blue-collar white voters, a partial count showed that Republicans captured the seats of at least 35 House Democrats in districts where the percentage of whites with a college degree lags the national average of 30.4 percent. {snip}</p>

<p>Was that fact simply another fact or intended to be a zinger launched at republicans and the right? Will even more voters defect to the right after reading that? Perhaps they should.</p>

<p>Oh what a pity, Comrade Brownstein!</p>
<p>The big question here is, will the Republicans finally get the message and work hand over fist to halt the march of multiculturalism?</p>
<p>I fear not, what they will focus on is their: &ldquo;connections&rdquo; with all voters; the &ldquo;inclusive broadening&rdquo; of their base; and of course, &ldquo;educating&rdquo; nonwhites that they too hold diversity to be a &ldquo;strength.&rdquo; I could be wrong, perhaps it is they who were &ldquo;educated&rdquo; this time and they will deliver; however, it is hard to see that coming when the Carl Rove and Dick Morris types have already begun to hoot and chirp like intoxicated chimps, that the reverse is true. The rapturous hyperbole in response to the elections of Marco Rubio and Nikki Haley by such fools as these, is all too instructive on this topic.</p>
<p>Much like 1994, the Republicans will probably blow this chance to demographically protect and expand the white majority of this country. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I think the main difference between 2008 and 2010 is that working middle class whites were suckered by the slick Obama ads about &#8220;ending outsourcing&#8221; in 2008, while in 2010 they recognized them as fraudulent posturing.</p>

		<p>College kids are indoctrinated.  It takes years before they realize their were indoctrinated and are able to transform their thinking.</p>
<p>White women are taught they are victims of the white man; hence they get the benifits of affirmative action without any guilt.  With that, they are more easily indoctrinated than white guys.</p>
<p><br>
But male or female, some college age white kids are starting to question some of the pc doctrine.  That means they are hearing something else when they go home to visit their parents.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly college-educated  &mdash;  I took a 24-week administrative assistant course  &mdash;  but I voted Constitution Party where I could, and where I couldn&rsquo;t I voted Libertarian.  This was AFTER looking up a site where I could find the candidates&rsquo; views on different issues.</p>
<p>Enough of the duopoly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit encouraged because it shows that people are tired of the Obamanation; still, one has to realize that heading for socialism at 100 mph versus heading for it at 50 mph still gets you there.</p>

		<p>Overall though you would have thought the victory would have been bigger. Dick Morris and others were predicting a bigger victory including the capture of the Senate. With the outrageous things Obamalama has been doing you would have thought this should have happened. The fact Harry Reid survived is disappointing. The way he lost-casinos shaking down employees, the SEIU in charge of voting machines, the possibility illegals voted, should be a cause for concern in future elections, that is the left wing knows how to play dirty (as AMREN fans know). </p>

		<p>Alexandra, here in the People&rsquo;s Republic of New York the Constitution Party isn&rsquo;t even on the ballot.  On the other hand, we did have a party on the ballot called &#8220;Rent is 2 Damn High&#8221;.  (I kid you not.)  Although I agree with Libertarians on many things, most are too much in favor of open borders, considering national boundaries to be evil constructions of the State.  At least Ron Paul is against illegal immigration, although I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d cut legal immigration.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the Republican Party would wake up and realize that as soon as whites are a permanent minority the Republican Party will be too.  Instead it is led by fools like Dick Armey who are convinced that blacks and Hispanics are natural Republicans, who just need to have the scales fall from their eyes.  At least I can credit blacks and Hispanics for voting in their own self interest, namely, for the party that believes in taking stuff from Whitey and giving it to them.  <br>

That said, I am glad that this election&rsquo;s implicit White backlash cannot be ignored or disregarded, at least on paper, by either party. It happened and they must ask themselves going forward, why!   </p>

		<p>The elections last night were encouraging.  Although I - like most AmRen readers - consider the Republicans to be better than the Democrats only on the surface, I think things might be changing in this regard.  The catalyst, of course, will be the Tea Party.  Some of their candidates lost, other won, but I have already heard speculation that the existence of the movement will move the Republicans further to the right.  And yes, I know, the Tea Party panders to minorities sometimes just like the mainstream politicians.  But, I think that, deep down, most Tea Party followers have a hint of &#8220;racial consciousness,&#8221; or whatever you wish to call it, left inside them.  They will certainly oppose things like affirmative action, rampant immigration, and illegal immigration, and I believe that this is just one step in the long reversal of liberalism in this country.  What we should hope and pray for now is the emergence of viable third parties.  Although I believe having a third party system can lead to confusion, unpopular politics winning elections, and instability, it is also our greatest chance at reclaiming our nation.  With four large political parties, for example, a nationalistic party could win with just 20-25% of the votes, thereby ensuring that whites slipping into minority status does not permanently doom any white racial movement.  I know that for know people of our ideological strain will ahve to be content with having no political party which represents our views.  In ten or twenty years, this may not be the case.</p>

<p><i>Democratic candidates suffered crippling defections among White voters</i></p>
<p><br>
Despite all the &#8216;good&rsquo; news last night, we Whites in California are not singing &#8216;Happy Happy Joy Joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is because we are no longer a majority of the state, our numbers fallen below 50% and shrinking.  We are 70% of the electorate and shrinking and most of that 70% are over 50. </p>
<p> There will come a point, soon, where few to no Whites will be elected across California, let alone a Republican or Libertarian.  Morons like cruz bustamante, antonio vivaLaRaza, fabian nunez and others of their low g-loaded, racist ilk will take the reins of California&rsquo;s government, in perpetuity.</p>
<p>While the rest of the country moved to the right, California turned further left, if that&rsquo;s possible, electing Moonbeam Brown,  AND passing Prop 25, which only requires a simple majority to pass a budget.  The vile Barbara Boxer has been re-inflicted on the senate.</p>
<p>Yet race replacement continues apace all across the country, we here on the Left Coast, a bit more &#8216;evolved&rsquo; than other states, the hispanic vote apparently aiding reid to victory in Nevada (which is on its way to becoming California).</p>
<p>Unless unfettered immigration illegal and legal is halted, not lessened, <i>halted now</i> you will soon be where we are, replaced by a brown hoard that does not respect anything except socialism, government handouts and racial privilege  &mdash;   at your expense if you are a productive, property owning White.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Rush:  <i>There won&rsquo;t be enough of us left to &#8216;make a difference&rsquo;</i></p>

		<p> This penchant for Whites to side with the Republicans   &mdash;   only 43 percent of us voted for Barack Obama in 2008   &mdash;   is usually passed by with averted eyes by the liberal media. Yet they never tire of telling us how blacks vote for the Democrats by margins as high as 90 percent in most elections. If they do mention the Whites-as-GOP fact, it&rsquo;s probably to suggest that dat ole debbil, White Racism, is still &#8220;alive and well&#8221; and living in Republican hearts.</p>
<p> The elections of two black Republican congressmen, two Hispanic governors, and an Indian Sikh as governor of South Carolina, is, of course, making it harder for the Dems to hang the &#8220;racist&#8221; label around the elephant&rsquo;s neck. But they&rsquo;ll still keep trying.</p>

		<p>Yeah-Republicans are winning outside of heavy hispanic Texas or the black South. So Republican States will include some states with lower poverty like Wisconian which is only 10 percent black and little Maine. Little Dems used the high poverty rate of Texas and MS as examples why people shouldn&rsquo;t vote for the Republicans.</p>

		<p>Obama was elected because most Americans want an end to race conflict, to the endless accusations and demands from black people. His election was seen as a cathartic, healing act that would bring the races together. But of course, he was not really made of presidential timber  &mdash;  he was an ACORN activist, a product of the south Chicago political machine, the least experienced member of the Senate  &mdash;  and it was a fantasy to think that his term would conclude successfully. So we are back where we started from  &mdash;  still under the assault of black activists, with no resolution to this perpetual problem of racial conflict. </p>

Many Democrats have given up on the white working class, and look forward to the time when whites will be in the minority. They should consider that the New Deal was only possible because third world immigration was curtailed, and civil rights legislation was not on the agenda. Blacks benefited from the New Deal, but they benefited as lower income people in ways that did not threaten white blue collar workers, who also benefited.<br>
 <br>
Another thing for Democrats to consider is that European Social Democracy has only been effective in countries where the overwhelming majority of the country is white. In the late 1960s many blacks took advantage of the expansion of the welfare system by quitting low wage jobs and going on welfare. Whites are much less likely to behave that way.  </p>

multiculturalism and diversity make any society vunerable to the most organized, aggressive, intelligent, ethnic people on earth.

		<p>The hypocrisy and duplicity of the left is now on full display.  They&rsquo;re celebrating the pyrrhic victories in Delaware and Nevada, while ignoring the meteoric rise of the Tea Party and resurgence of the GOP.  Women candidates are constantly demeaned, while minority Republican winners are totally ignored.  They whistle past the graveyard with constant chatter about the inevitability of Palin, while nervously trying to ignore the much bigger threat  &mdash;  Marco Rubio, a charismatic white Cuban-American who can draw millions of both Anglo and Latino votes.</p>

<p>I am a Constitutionalist Conservative, but I remain in the Republican Party to vote in their Primaries, such as voting for Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, and Ron Paul. </p>
<p>More of you Conservatives, Nationalists, and Constitionalists should rejoin the Party, on paper only, to make an impact on their Primaries. If they fail to produce a Candidate that will bend to our demands, then we can still exercise our right to vote Constitution Party, America First Party, or American Third Position Party, or write-in who we want on the ballot.  </p>

		<p>The interesting thing about this midterm upset is the ramifications for the 2012 elections. Of course anything can happen in two years, but there are going to be some ROYALLY ticked off blacks if the Big O is voted out after one term. You think they&rsquo;re mad now&hellip; Race conflict will be on steroids if he&rsquo;s not re-elected. Regardless, he needs to be gone</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not concerned with rioting blacks when Obama loses.  They&rsquo;ll do it anyway.  They would riot if he didn&rsquo;t get a 3rd term after a second term they rioted for.  Best to deal with it sooner than later.<br>

		<p>Who, exactly, are they counting as &#8220;College Educated White Women&#8221;?  Graduates of &#8216;Beauty Colleges&rsquo;?  The colleges offering &#8216;Online Degrees&rsquo;?  Fingernail Technicians?</p>
<p>My mental image of the group is of the poor little things who barely managed to pass Math 100&hellip;finally&hellip;after several tries&hellip;in order to get their &#8216;English&rsquo; degrees from third-rate schools&hellip;.seething with &#8216;Feminist Rage&rsquo; at &#8216;Society&rsquo;.  I know the type&hellip;.lives filled with The Three &#8216;C&rsquo;s (Coffee, Cats, and Cigarettes)&hellip;drifting from one bookshop job to another (until they finally are broken-down enough to live happily-ever-after on Disability)&hellip;smoldering with anger at the injustice of it all&hellip;that they were not able to foist their shapeless, unexercised bodies off on wealthy, poetic, modern-day Heathcliffs, that they might go off to live in mansions and drive Bentleys.</p>
<p>Ah, yes!  I&rsquo;m even related to a couple of those.  Before Hilary lost-out, they were saying they&rsquo;d support Obama if they couldn&rsquo;t vote for Hilary. They were ready for some CHANGE. I&rsquo;d sit there at family gatherings, silently praying, &#8220;Please, Lord, let me keep my mouth shut until I can get out of here.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Aside from those winners, the only person I know, black or white, who supported Obama is a white female 400lb. Jabba-The-Hut-lookalike who smoked while she was pregnant, can&rsquo;t drive because of drug convictions (getting off Crack cased her weight problem, you know).  But I don&rsquo;t think the Jabbaette finished Highschool.  She&rsquo;s an outreach project of a friend of a friend.  Last time we dropped some stuff off at her house, she was still rooting for The Obamazoid.  </p>
<p>So again I ask: who exactly are these &#8216;College Educated White Females&rsquo; who still support Obama?  Portraits, please!</p>

		<p>If Obama is going to lose the 2012 election, then he&rsquo;d better get whipped soundly in the Electoral College, say by a margin of 380-158. This will forestall any major rioting by blacks.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, an electoral fiasco like 2000 were to occur, then there could be race riots the likes of which haven&rsquo;t been seen since King&rsquo;s assassination. Because of this, I predict that there will be another round of Americans buying firearms at a feverish pace, starting in late 2011, on a grand nationwide scale - especially since SCOTUS ruled in McDonald v. Chicago that the Second Amendment applies in every city, town, village and township in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>There is precedent. The election of 1860 was the one that split the nation in two, with Southern states threatening secession if Lincoln won. He won handily, even though his name was not on the ballot in the Southern states. The rest is grim history.</p>
<p>To Lauren (re post # 31):</p>
<p>The &#8220;college-educated&#8221; women you ask about are those for whom Roe v. Wade and abortion rights are the centerpieces of their very existence.</p>

		<p>Shawn #29: It&rsquo;s not the first time I read something like what you wrote, about Blacks being outraged if Whites vote Barry out after one term. So what? Unless he gets the votes, he&rsquo;s out. That&rsquo;s how it works. And too damned bad if the Blacks don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>My Candidate, who was not the other Amnesty idiot, didn&rsquo;t even get any attention paid to him by his own Party, but I, and those I know who backed him, didn&rsquo;t commit violent acts because this moron won the Election, did we? That&rsquo;s how Civilized people act.</p>
<p>But, just like Welfare, Food Stamps, Section 8 Housing, and EOE/Affirmative Action, Blacks somehow believe that the Presidency, along with those other goodies, is something that should be handed to them. </p>
<p>If they are stupid enough to put this misplaced anger into anything physical against White voters, or in majority White neighborhoods, they just might start something around the country that can&rsquo;t be contained, or stopped.</p>
