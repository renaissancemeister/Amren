			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dr. Boyce Watkins, NewsOne, November 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Politicians chase votes the way a frat boy chases women. Also like the frat boy, politicians can have selective memory when it comes to creating a respectable and reciprocal relationship. They beg for your votes, promise you the world and then promptly disappear until it&rsquo;s time for re-election.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of what we&rsquo;re seeing right now from the Obama Administration. The Obama camp has rarely used the words &#8220;black man&#8221; or &#8220;black woman&#8221; in public for the last year, yet they are suddenly hanging in the hood more than the barber and the local drug dealer. They are holding forums to rally black voters for the mid-term elections and telling black folks to vote as if Obama were on the ballot.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I am not one to say that voting isn&rsquo;t important, but something has GOT to give. {snip} If we choose to support Barack Obama or any politician for that matter, is there a point where we can actually give justification for that support? When should the politician show up with clear evidence that he has specifically worked to address needs that directly impact our community? {snip}</p>
<p>Black America must issue a challenge to the Obama Administration: Will you still be inviting black bloggers to the White House after the election is over the way you did this month? Will you still be holding events in the inner city to bring together black voters the way you are right now with the rapper Common? Will we hear about plans to directly address the wealth and employment gaps in America, or are we going to hear the same lame excuses we heard this year? Can we find a way to help black men to re-enter society after their prison terms are over, or are we going to remain committed to incarcerating as many black men as possible? Are you going to offer us as much as you&rsquo;re asking, or are we simply going to be expected to be the people who save you from the Republicans who want your head? {snip}</p>
<p>One of the problems that black people have is that we&rsquo;ve not grown out of the habit of falling in love with our politicians. The problem with loving a politician unconditionally is that politicians are not wired to love you back. When it was time to put a black woman on the Supreme Court, the Obama camp chose the president&rsquo;s less-than-qualified Harvard crony Elena Kagan instead. When it was time for black unemployment to be addressed, the Obama Administration chose to stay away from the issue altogether. While black men rot away in America&rsquo;s prisons and black families are being destroyed by mass incarceration, Attorney General Eric Holder only made time to deal with the Arizona immigration issue. A serious problem facing many African Americans today is that there is simply nothing about voting that makes them excited, other than the fact that their president has a black face. We allow images of the Obama family on the cover of Ebony Magazine to control our political decisions, and it might be time for us to grow out of this. {snip} He doesn&rsquo;t have to throw a black fist in the air, but he can&rsquo;t just reach out for us in the dark, when he needs us and when no one else is looking.</p>

<p>Oh, and whose fault is that?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right!  It&rsquo;s the white man&rsquo;s fault.  Black people are never responsible for anything wrong in their lives.  No, it has to be racism.  Right?</p>

		<p>Well, it is funny and ironic for this black writer, pissed because Obama hasn&rsquo;t directly handed bundles of cash to blacks, to criticize the Kagan Court appointment. It takes a black activist to point out this bad version of a Jewish comic (Joy Behar in black robes) isn&rsquo;t qualified for the Supreme Court? Or to handle your auto accident case or estate either, for that matter. </p>
<p>Whatever it takes to erode the Bedazzling One&rsquo;s Image. It&rsquo;s all to the good.</p>

		<p>Black families aren&rsquo;t rotting away because of mass incarceration of black men. They&rsquo;re rotting because of the welfare state and white liberal feminists teaching that women don&rsquo;t need men.<br>
And black men are in prison in greater numbers because more of them commit crimes.</p>

<p>No, one of  &ldquo;the problems that black people have,&rdquo; is that they are sub-ignorant and accustomed to having politics, be it of the Red left or neo-con &ldquo;right,&rdquo; cater to them. The time has come, to tell blacks, your problems are &ldquo;ours,&rdquo; only in that you be &ldquo;da problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, shut your worthless black mouths and expect nothing; that is far better, than you really deserve!</p>
<p>If you do not think so, we need to discuss Detroit and redress all other racial &ldquo;equality issues,&rdquo; from that vantage point!!!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!!</p>

		<p>Hey Pal, the solution to the black incarceration rate is very simple.  Behave, and be lawful.  Obey the law.  Simple, huh?  But not for blacks apparently.   Blacks appear to be hardwired in the jungle savage mode.  I understand that average black IQ borders on the retarded, but you&rsquo;d think even THEY could &#8220;get&#8221; the connection between breaking the law, and prison time.  </p>

I get a feeling that the Obama administration has been trying to not be seen has going out of their way to &#8216;help&rsquo; blacks.</p>
<p>If the Obama administration had pressed black issues or an obvious black agenda, they know they would be labeled a black administration and opened the door to criticism and defeat by whites.</p>
<p>As I predicted when President Obama was elected, blacks would eventually feel slighted by Obama because he isn&rsquo;t black enough.<br>

		<p>It continues to amaze me that Black people can openly and stridently advocate for the interests of their own group without receiving a word of criticism, yet Whites are hysterically vilified for even noticing that there is such a thing as White group interest.</p>

<p>In the South, the Black vote matters in some counties. No where else though.</p>

		<p>Many years ago there was a talk show host on the radio nationwide who was a very intelligent black man who used the song &#8220;Dixie&#8221; as his theme song. He was married to a white woman.  He continually thanked white people for bringing his ancestors to this country from Africa - because of slavery he was able to take advantage of all the wonderful opportunities offered by this country without which he would have not been able to prosper as he had.</p>
<p>Here was a man really trying hard to assimilate into &#8220;whiteness&#8221; and doing a pretty good job of it.  Other blacks hated him.  But his reason for living was to show blacks how to prosper in this country; he constantly preached education. He said that if blacks wanted to prosper they could, but they would have to change their way of thinking so that they thought more like whites.  Family stability was of utmost importance and having children out of wedlock and homes without a live-in father as the head of household was causing the destruction of the black race.  He said not to look at the white man for prosperity but to look to yourself, and that blacks should control their own destiny by modifying their behavior patterns. </p>
<p>Obviously he is no longer on the radio.  I always thought that he had a great attitude and that blacks who listened to him and followed his advice would do well for themselves.  Unfortunately 85% of blacks would not entertain such thoughts because they were &#8220;white thoughts&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s at least the same percentage today.</p>
<p>Bottom line - blacks should not look to Obama or other black (or white) politicians to improve their lifestyles, they must look inside themselves.   </p>
<p>What do you think the chances of this happening are?  </p>

		<p>Obama was so unwelcome at 95% of the campaigns this year that he was forced to attend black urban centers.  He visited large OH cities at least a dozen times, coming to Cleveland so many times that, at the last stop, he filled only half a small stadium.  <br>
Blacks are used to black politicians who abuse them.  I guess they figure it beats having white pols do the same.</p>

<p>When I got to the above paragraph I stopped reading the story.  The man is an absolute airhead to think in terms of black criminals being victims who we are obligated to help when they&rsquo;re released from the slammer.  The same slammer, incidentally, where moronic black leaders and AA journalists claim blacks are placed because of whitey&rsquo;s racism and oppression, as this bald-headed disaster is claiming.  Obviously, he&rsquo;s a liar as well.  </p>
<p>You see, blacks aren&rsquo;t in prison at far greater rates than other races, because they commit more crime.  They&rsquo;re there, because of the &#8220;injustice&#8221; of the system. </p>
<p>The only answer is to get rid of ALL of them the first opportunity that comes along, like an economic fiasco.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the significance of voting on the basis of racial solidarity! This is not the 1950&rsquo;s. Blacks had a cultural reason to be suspicious of white people. White liberals hadn&rsquo;t done their damage with their failed government tax payer funded social policies yet!</p>

<p>Not very much.  When voting districts were gerrymandered to provide black-majority districts, the unintended result was that the other districts near and around them instantly became very heavily white.  This is why the US southeast went GOP very quickly.</p>

		<p>If you want some idea of the kind of candidate that blacks will flock to support because of his race, look at Alvin Greene in South Carolina: an unemployed man (black, of course), who lives with his parents despite being in his thirties, who can barely form a coherent sentence, and whose response to every question is &#8220;DeMint started the recession&#8221; and &#8220;I definin&rsquo; where we at as a country&#8221;. Indeed, he is.</p>
