<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fgw-juarez-americans-20101102,0,6468662.story">4 Americans Killed in Mexican Border Town</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, November 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four U.S. citizens were shot to death in separate attacks in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexican authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>Chihuahua state prosecutors&rsquo; spokesman Arturo Sandoval said Edgar Lopez, 35, of El Paso, Texas, was killed Sunday along with two Mexican men when gunmen opened fire on a group standing outside a house.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a 26-year-old U.S. woman and an American boy were slain shortly after crossing an international bridge from El Paso. Giovanna Herrera and Luis Araiza, 15, were shot to death along with a Mexican man traveling with them just after 11 a.m., Sandoval said.</p>
<p>Sandoval said authorities also identified a 24-year-old woman killed Friday inside a tortilla shop as Lorena Izaguirre, a U.S. citizen and El Paso resident. A Mexican man was also found dead in the store.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ciudad Juarez has become one of the world&rsquo;s deadliest cities amid a turf war between the Sinaloa and Juarez drug cartels. More than 2,000 people have been killed this year in the city, which is across the border from El Paso.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elsewhere, three city police officers were gunned down early Monday in a drive-by shooting as they patrolled the heart of Acapulco&rsquo;s upscale tourist district, authorities said.</p>
<p>Another officer was wounded, according to a statement from the Public Safety Department in southern Guerrero state, where Acapulco is located.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Violence continues to escalate in the Pacific resort city, days after Mayor Jose Luis Avila Sanchez warned people to stay indoors after dark. Ten other people were killed between Sunday and Monday around the area. Authorities also were trying to determine whether a burned corpse found in a car was the body of a Canadian businessman who disappeared last week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the remains of seven people were found Sunday in a mass grave in Nogales, on the Arizona border. Mayor Jose Angel Hernandez said a family walking near the site noticed what appeared to be part of a body sticking up in a riverbed. Officers recovered six bodies and a severed head in the grave. A seventh headless body was found nearby.</p>

		<p>They might have been American citizens, but their surnames were Hispanic. Did they not know how dangerous Mexico is? Or did they think that their Hispanic features were some kind of magical shieldwall, that would protect them from harm?</p>

		<p>Three men were just busted in Texas in a federal arms smuggling sting for trying to smuggle military weapons, including assault rifles equipped with grenade launchers and grenades that can blow holes in any vehicle other than a main battle tank. There were going to smuggle them out of my city and ship them to the drug cartels. These deaths and this intercepted shipment shows what&rsquo;s in store for white Americans at the hands of these unwashed, violent and criminal invaders if their violence and their invasions are allowed to go unchecked here. We will have to either secure the border, or fight a brutal war where we kill or drive all Mexicans out of the U.S., then punish Mexico with devastating attacks upon their population, military and infrastructure.</p>

		<p>Mexico is getting worse.  Each year brings an escalation over and above the last, and with 28,000 dead since 2006, it has a higher casualty count than most wars that have been fought recently by the US.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a war zone, and the government is too weak to stop it. The war on drugs is a failure and will NEVER be won.  The cartels have most of the Mexican government personnel on their payrolls, plus most police, mayors, and other politicians.</p>
<p>The Gulf and Los Zeta cartels are fighting each other as well, with the Tijuana cartel coming in as a minor player, but a rabidly dangerous one.</p>
<p>As the world continues to decline economically, cartel smuggling couldn&rsquo;t be better and their raking in billions every year.  If it keeps up, the cartels will be more powerful, economically AND militarily, than most countries, including Mexico.</p>

		<p>1-Jeddermann: Not too harsh at all. They were Mexicans, living in Mexico (although some would still call those areas part of the United States), who died after an extremely short illness due to catching the Mexican bullet flu. That they held American citizenship was of little or no consequence.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Nope.  Of course I&rsquo;m probably not a good baromter, being just a little right of Qin Shi Huangdi when it comes to &#8216;Great Walls&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You got such pressing business as to be &#8216;standing outside a house&rsquo; (buying drugs&hellip;) after crossing into Juarez in explicit contravention of warnings not to do so, you have lost your White Spidey Sense and deserve no pity for your fate.</p>
<p>Of course, with names like those, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t know who Peter Parker was to begin with.</p>
<p>I honestly hope that Mexico _implodes_ and that, as a result, whites finally get to see it for the failed narco-state that it really is and stage a sudden-shun drawback from the entire concept of &#8216;latino wondrousness&rsquo; that is welfare migration for all and sundry.</p>
<p>I also hope we make it a death penalty offense to be a Mexican caught smuggling or selling on this side of the border.  Drugs or Humans.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll settle for keeping our noses out of their affairs until they bring their coming civil war to our side of the border.  In which case, I sincerely hope Obama is still in office so that we can see how he reacts to the idea of &#8216;shooting on this side of the river&rsquo; because he wouldn&rsquo;t build and man a damn fence to keep them on theirs.</p>

		<p>Recently boxing promoter and lifelong liberal Democrat Bob Arum was hyping a fight card he had put together in Tijuana.</p>
<p>At the behest of that city&rsquo;s mayor Arum actually held a press conference in which he asked American tourists to stop avoiding Mexico because of the baseless urban legends claiming it was a violent, dangerous country.</p>

		<p>The tourist areas are being hit hard too. They just found a mass grave with 18 bodies in Acapulco. Apparently the men tourists from a nearby state, they all worked together and took a yearly vacation. All were kidnapped then found weeks later in the grave.</p>
<p>That is going to be very bad for tourism.</p>

		<p>To Madison Grant (re post # 8):</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Bob Arum thinks only of lining his own pockets. Is he that stupid to think Americans will risk life and limb just to go to Mexico to watch a fight card he put together?</p>
<p>What if Arum gave a fight card, and nobody came?</p>
