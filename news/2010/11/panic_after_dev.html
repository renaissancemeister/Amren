<h1><a href="https://guardian.co.tt/news/general/2010/11/11/panic-after-devil-attack-school">Panic After &#8216;Devil Attack&rsquo; at School </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Radhica Sookraj, Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, Nov. 11. 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Panic broke out at the Moruga Composite School yesterday as 17 female students fell mysteriously ill and began rolling on the ground, hissing and blabbering in a strange tongue, after suffering bouts of nausea and headaches. Two of the students reportedly tried to throw themselves off a railing and had to be physically restrained, triggering fears of a possible demon attack. The drama started during the lunch hour in the Form One block and quickly spread to other areas. Form Five student Kern Mollineau, who attends the Lighthouse Tabernacle Church, said he got worried when the girls&rsquo; eyes began rolling up in their heads and they began beating up on the ground.</p>
<p>With the assistance of several other students and teachers, the pupils were taken to the multi-purpose hall where some of them fell into a semi-conscious state. Mollineau recalled: &#8220;One girl was blabbering as if in a strange language. I could not understand what she was saying. &#8220;It was sounding like &#8216;shebbaberbebeb shhhhee.&rsquo; The girls were unusually strong. We had to hold them down so that they will not hurt themselves. &#8220;The teachers were right there. I get a kick in my face when one of the girls started beating up on the floor. Many of them had bruises.&#8221; Mollineau claimed he actually communicated with the &#8220;devil which had possessed the girl. &#8220;I asked the Devil what he wanted with the girls and the voice said he wanted a life. He kept saying to send the girls in the toilet and to leave them alone,&#8221; Mollineau claimed.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic priests, as well as pastors from nearby churches, including Josephine Charles, Deborah Charles and Pastor Gordon, visited the school and began showering the children with holy water and prayers. Two more students, Kriston Mollineau and Kishon Bethel, said they too were called by teachers to assist the ill girls. Kriston said the girls complained of headaches and some of them wanted to go to the toilet. Six ambulances arrived at the school accompanied by police teams from the Moruga and St Mary&rsquo;s Police Post. A party of fire officers from the Princes Town Fire Station, led by acting Assistant Divisional Fire Officer Ramdeo Boodoo visited the school and began conducting several tests on the surroundings to determine the cause of the problem. </p>
<p>Boodoo said there was nothing in the environment to trigger fainting spells, nausea and headaches. A teacher, who requested anonymity, said two weeks ago an Orisha woman came to the school and had a dispute with a member of staff. He said following the dispute, the woman threatened to deal with the school administration. Another teacher said the school was built on a burial site, but neighbours who live around the school denied that was so. A source at the school confirmed that all 17 pupils were taken to the Princes Town Health Facility where they were medically examined. The other students were sent home at 2 pm.</p>
<p>Responding yesterday, Minister in the Ministry of Education Clifton de Coteau said he was aware that pupils had to be taken for medical attention. De Coteau said Student Support Service officials were sent to the school and students were expected to receive counselling. A statement from the Ministry of Education said the Public Transport Service Corporation (PTSC) made maxi taxis available to the school to assist the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM) which provided additional ambulances.</p>

		<p>Oh dear Jesus! Sounds a lot like the &#8220;fits&#8221; taken by the teenaged girls during the Salem Witch Trials here in America  &mdash;  350 years ago&hellip; We have hopefully gotten past that stage but if we keep importing people from these primitive cultures 350-400 years behind us in development we will regress instead of grow.</p>

		<p>My brother, the smart one, does this for a living. He is a scientist specializing in mosquito and parasitic studies. When ever an office or other workplace is convulsed with unexplained itching or illness,it is his job to determine if there is a plausible factor like parasites or if it is all hysteria.<br>
  But it was his mosquito research and the rainbow makeup of the new military that drove him close to despair. The Federal government had ordered a study to correlate rain fall levels and mosquito infestation. Lower level enlisted men would read  rain gauges throughout the area and then the eggheads would make deductions based on the levels of rainfall and larve. <br>
  One summer  a few years back there was an actual crisis brewing due to the explosion of new larve during a dry season. As my brother put it, &#8220;Picture 35 to 50 of the brightest minds in the US, sequestered in a Holiday Inn conference room in the Midwest for days on end trying to find the cause of the outbreak. Well, find it they did&hellip; It seems that the enlisted men, whose only job was to read and record rainfall levels, were instead smoking pot in the barracks and writing down any old number on the rain gauge charts!!<br>
   My brother despaired to see science perverted in such a way. I told him that at least the culprits were dishonest through laziness and  not ideology. This time anyway&hellip;</p>

		<p>Post # 2:  I observed a similar case at a major USA research univerity.  A foreign grad student was required to stay in the greenhouse all night watching insect behavior.  He drank a lot of coffee.  Because the nearest bathroom was 50 yards away, this student usually urinated in a row of large soil pots that contained small trees for a research study being conducted by a different laboratory.  </p>
<p>A couple of those particular trees died, and the professor published a paper on his amazing new discovery, but never knew the real reason for the odd results.</p>
<p>The bottom line is (1) you always need to be a little skeptical. (2) Only hire qualified employees.</p>

		<p>    It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve researched it but it is my understanding that there were something like 19 lost their lives in the Salem witch trials . None were burned at the stake as is commonly thought, not in North America . One died from the application of weights to his body, a couple more died in captvity and the rest were hanged . There was an occult movement going on at the time . Hard times tends to produce hard people . I don&rsquo;t see a lot of difference there than putting 16 and 17 year olds before the firing squad for refusing to &#8221; go over the top,&#8221; during WW1 . The best we can do is try to learn from it and not make the same mistake twice . But bringing these third worlders into our midst under the guise of &#8220;diversity&#8221; is nothng short of cultural suicide .    </p>

		<p>The only atheists in our world are the PC leftist spawn of Marx, Nietzsche, etc.  This must hurt like &#8220;hell&#8221; to them when these incidents of weird religious fervor appear amongst their beloved third worlders.</p>
<p>P.S.  Other than the MSM, are there any missionaries for atheism?</p>

		<p>You have to watch out for these Pentecostal churches where people roll in the aisle and act completely bonkers.</p>
<p>My in-laws personally knew of a couple that went to such a church and this couple had issues with objects flying around.  I kid you not.</p>
<p>As for the Salem witch hunts, what came down to was girls being caught practicing witchcraft, and to protect themselves they accused Christians of being witches and of putting hexes on them.  It was Christians who were executed.  Just a little FYI.</p>

		<p>I have a friend whose mother, of English and Indian descent, is from Trinidad.  About half the population there is black, and, as in other Caribbean locales, there&rsquo;s a lot of voodoo (or its equivalent) practiced there.  The nation is now in the usual decline that accompanies black political empowerment.  <br>
I recently read that, in Haiti, UN workers are being accused of causing the cholera epidemic.  Attacks are occurring, and such incidents will drive out the UN before long.  The nation is doomed, and might as well be left to die.  <br>

When reading about this nonsensical behavior, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that Trinidad &amp; Tobago (along with Bermuda and Barbados) are usually trotted out as examples of &#8220;successful&#8221; Caribbean nations. The ones who &#8220;made it&#8221; after decolonization in the 1960s. The &#8220;good&#8221; islands that liberals like to talk about to &#8220;prove&#8221; that not every black-run entity in the area has to be a basket-case like Jamaica or a Hell-on-Earth like Haiti. </p>
<p>But boasting that Trinidad &amp; Tobago are better than Jamaica or Haiti isn&rsquo;t really setting the bar very high, is it? Nor can we safely assume that the bar   &mdash;   like the limbo dancing bars of that that region   &mdash;   in the &#8220;good&#8221; Caribbean islands won&rsquo;t over time be lowered further and further, to the floor-scraping levels found in the region&rsquo;s &#8220;bad&#8221; islands. </p>
<p>And if these superstitious schoolchildren with their imaginary &#8220;demonic possessions&#8221; represent the next generation of Trinidadians, then that bar is ALREADY being lowered as we speak. Trenchtown, here we come! Port au Prince, full speed ahead! </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, there are some evangelical white American preachers encouraging this behavior. You see them often on stage dancing clap then moments later rolling in the floor.</p>
