<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.de/national/20101104-30949.html">Muslims Call For Public Service Immigrant Quota</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local (Germany), November 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Germany&rsquo;s top Muslim group called on Thursday for an immigrant quota in public services such as the police and the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Central Council of Muslims chairman Aiman Mazyek told Thursday&rsquo;s edition of the Neue Osnabr√ºcker Zeitung that people with foreign names and immigration backgrounds were often passed over for public service jobs despite having the same or even better qualifications than native German candidates.</p>
<p>A quota would be an appropriate way to level the playing field, he said.</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s police forces had already opened themselves up to immigrants, which had benefited the services  &mdash;  and could be improved with quotas  &mdash;  he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should the experiences of the police not be applied elsewhere?&#8221; Mazyek asked.</p>
<p>His remarks followed a national &#8220;integration summit&#8221; held on Wednesday and attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel, immigrant community leaders  &mdash;  including Mazyek  &mdash;  and state and municipal officials.</p>
<p>The meeting, which was held to discuss how immigrants could be better integrated with mainstream German society, focused on recognition of foreign qualifications  &mdash;  currently seen as one of the best ways to improve immigrants&rsquo; job prospects and therefore their integration.</p>
<p>After the summit, Mazyek accused Merkel&rsquo;s conservative Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, of using immigration and integration as election weapons, rather than tackling them seriously.</p>
<p>He said integration would &#8220;not be improved by a multiplication of summits.&#8221;</p>
<p>The real work would have to happen in the field, and that including an opening up of the job market, public offices and political parties to immigrants.</p>
<p>Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) chairman Kenan Kolat also lavished the summit with faint praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Integration summits are all very well, but this to me was a preparation for the worst,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The summit had been less a dialogue than a series of monologues, he added.<br>

		<p>Will Turkey offer a reciprocal quota of Germans in its public service?  Hardly likely.</p>
<p>Will Chinese, Blacks, Arabs, Hispanics and Indians begin migrating to Germany in order to claim their right to a German government job?  Yes, definitely, just as they do in Canada.</p>
<p>Government jobs in Western countries are scarce and coveted opportunities. When every level of government is forced to participate, they&rsquo;ll then go after private businesses and contractors who provide services to government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slippery slope.  Any white country that voluntarily places the yoke of multiculturalism upon its shoulders will be shackled by its own laws, and forever forced to discriminate against its own blood family.  </p>

<p>On the surface, this is absolutely true.  But I don&rsquo;t know of any white country which VOLUNTARILY adopted multiculturalism.  It has always been imposed (and enforced) in a top-down manner, without any previous consultation of the citizens who must bear the consequences.  That&rsquo;s definitely the case in Canada, and elsewhere too, I imagine.</p>

		<p>Importing cheap labor in the 1960s to empty garbage bins and sweep the roads has profound and unforseen consequennces 45 years later.<br>
  Of course in the long run there is no such thing as &#8216;cheap labor&rsquo;, any cost/benefit analysis will show that it&rsquo;s an appaling bargain, a Faustian bargain in fact (this being Germany!), in which the price for picking up one&rsquo;s rubbish is one&rsquo;s soul - and boy the Devil is determined to get it, immigrant accepting nations might think they can con and outwit the Devil, but he will always but always carry off the prize which he &#8216;rightfully&rsquo; won, no matter what.</p>

<p>When will this PC AA Multi-tribal rubbish STOP? We must wake up now.</p>
<p>Our local police forces have embraced multiculturalism by setting up special task forces to deal with Middle Eastern &amp; Asian CRIME! We don&rsquo;t have too much &#8220;black&#8221; crime here yet but at the rate we are taking in Sudanese and Somalis &hellip;</p>

		<p>For the German People: &#8216;temporary labor&rsquo; = non-immigrant.<br>
For the Turkish Workers: Doing scut work = entitlement to <br>
                         citizenship.<br>
For the German Government: Economic Dominance = Cheap Workers.</p>
<p>After nationalism twice destroyed the perception of a government as being for the purposes of conserving and advancing it&rsquo;s indigenous peoples, government now reflects little more than a negotiatory instrument for Big Business.  This was done on purpose.  All the muddle about &#8216;failed multiculturalism&rsquo; is just another smokescreen for _contract negotiations_.<br>
Germans deserver better.<br>

# 2 Is quite correct, &ldquo;The slippery slope&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are 2 very well known lessons from ancient history that the West should remember and perhaps take more take note of. These are of course the story of the Hebrew Slaves in Egypt and the Trojan Horse. Initially both were accepted but the end result was the same, total destruction of nations and cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; If you are going to quote from history, try some actual historic examples, because; 1. There is NO evidence that the Hebrew slaves in Egypt is anything more than a religious myth (i.e., no archeological or other evidence to corroborate ANY OT story has been found or confirmed), and Egypt did not collapse in the period the Exodus claims anyway.  2. The Trojan Horse was a military tactic, a way of getting fighters inside a cities gates, not a social, cultural system that allowed or overturned an existing one through various non-military means.</p>
<p>One need look no farther than the Roman example for these examples.  Too bad that Christianity features are one of the items that historically caused the fall of Rome and the decline into &#8220;darkness.&#8221;  (Superstitious negativity that suppressed practical knowledge and replaced it with a system that delayed progress for nearly a thousand years).  But peopling its army with foreign fighters, making everyone in the Empire citizens, allowing all peoples to come and settle in Rome (and environs), along with some other problems like disease, lead poisoning, a century of affliction with malaria, etc., also had a devastating effect.  But the West is in a way duplicating that by bringing in increasing numbers of third world peoples who bring diseases into the general populations, allowing new outbreaks and excellerated &#8220;open labs&#8221; for bacteria and viruses to mutate into forms that will eventually wipe out millions and cause world population crashes.  Perhaps it is all inevitable?  Likely, because it is now Politically Incorrect to quarranteen anyone!<br>

<p>Hmmm, well, I withdraw MY consent, but nothing happened except some new conservative faces have shown up to show us how well they can rule - again, as if they did such a great job before themselves.  </p>
<p>No, as misrule continues and grows as it has for the past 40 years, the central government will grow more out of touch and irrelavant to the people it pretends to govern.  When economics cause police forces and other services to reduce size and shut down, even as the need for more actually increases, people will have to begin to govern themselves without central consent.  The institutions will disolve via lack of funds/participation.  I am not saying that it is useless to vote, vote and hope, but not too much.  I predict that in 50 years, the situation will be near anarchy, in the classic sense.  </p>

<p>This is always the case.  First, they come into you country to take jobs making beds and peeling vegetables. Next thing, they (or their children) are demanding a say in how you run your country. </p>
<p>Sorry, that was not the original understanding!  You came in to be gastarbeiters, not voters.  If I hire a maid to come in to clean my home, I do not expect her or her children to demand a share of the house. But this is now it goes. Soon they lose track of who is who and get their roles confused with yours.</p>

<p>Or, it was surreptitiously slipped across on the populace, like a mickey slipped into a drink. That&rsquo;s how it was in the USA, as best I recall.  Nobody was ever told, or asked. </p>
<p>Until the early 90&rsquo;s,  I never heard of it before, then suddenly, there it was! It seemingly from out of nowhere.  Suddenly, we were being  told (by all the opinion makers and authority people) how wonderful and enriching  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is, and that we should  &#8220;celebrate&#8221;  our spendid multiculturalism which was making us stronger, richer, and better. It just came at us from out of nowhere. </p>

<p>Ninety percent?  So what!  The people who were in key positions of control got what they wanted anyway.   The truth is that we are not in control of our country/ies. We have always been ruled by small but powerful minorities pursuing their own interests but pretending to &#8220;represent&#8221; or &#8220;serve&#8221; the majority. That&rsquo;s just a convenient  fantasy to distract you.</p>
<p>You are under the delusion that we have majority rule and  that we are in charge of our own affairs. That&rsquo;s exactly what &#8220;they&#8221; want you to think.</p>

Ninety percent elicits a &#8220;so what&#8221; from you? </p>
<p>&#8220;People in key positions of control&#8221; got there because Americans allowed their country to slowly revert from small-r republicanism to small-d democracy, which was not the form intended by the Founders.  The Founders intended Senators to be the appointed representatives of the states to the federal government, for instance.  This is republicanism.  This is gone from our country.  </p>
<p>Now we have mob rule, precisely the reason why those people in key positions of control are able to wreak the havoc they do.  There&rsquo;s no real check on their power because most voters are idiots and don&rsquo;t understand the complexity of the issues before them. </p>
<p>They, them&hellip;&hellip;.let the defeatist blacks lament the evil machinations of the faceless, omnipresent &#8220;Man.&#8221;  I expect more from my fellow Whites.  You&rsquo;re offering up the exact same cop-out as a crack-addled criminal loser and that&rsquo;s not acceptable.  No wonder we are where we are today.  As long as you keep voting and paying taxes, these people are serving at your pleasure.</p>
<p>Whiteplight, I expect much the same unfolding of events will slowly erode the power of the federal government.  My point is we can hasten this, rather than wait for it to come, if a small core of taxpayers decided to stop participating in the federal government, a sort of &#8220;Atlas Shrugged&#8221; situation.  </p>
<p>It was a small minority of Colonials that brought about the Revolution, and they didn&rsquo;t know they were going to win.  I think sometimes we forget that.</p>
