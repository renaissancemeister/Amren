	<p><big><strong>Richard Alba, <em>Ethnic Identity: The Transformation of White America</em>, Yale University Press, 1990, 374 pp., $35.00</strong></big></p>
<p>        <span class="dropcap">I</span>n an era in which the ethnic demands of everyone but white people are the subject of such obligatory interest, it is a pleasant surprise to find a book about the ethnic identities of Americans of European descent. And if, as the flyleaf claims, the author goes on to explore the dawning consciousness of whites as &ldquo;European-Americans,&rdquo; the book would seem promising. Ethnic Identity is, in fact, a useful analysis of what white Americans think about their European origins, and the book is worth reading for that. As a reflection on rising white consciousness, it is no more than one would expect from a mainstream university press.</p>
<p>          The author, Professor Richard Alba, has based his book not only on general sources but on a detailed survey of white ethnic identity that he carried out himself. His primary message is simple: The American melting pot has been a roaring success, so long as its ingredients have been white. With the exception of Jews, virtually every group of European immigrants has, within three generations, become largely indistinguishable from the others. The old English stock painlessly absorbed immigrants from northern Europe, and even digested the southern and eastern Europeans and the Irish without much more than a gurgle and a case of heartburn.</p>
<p>        As Professor Alba points out, the ultimate test of assimilation is the ease and frequency of intermarriage. On this score, there is virtually no European group that has failed to mingle with the rest. Three quarters of the marriages of white people today cut across lines of European nationality. Indeed, as the author argues, at this rate the very notion of European ethnicity is blurring.</p>
<p>        Only Jews, with an intermarriage rate of only one quarter to one third, resist the final step to assimilation, and this resistance weakens only slightly in succeeding American-born generations. Jewish endogamy is even more remarkable, since a group that is no more than 2&frac12; percent of the population would normally have a very high rate of marriage outside the group, if only because of the scarcity of potential spouses. Jews also differ from other European immigrants in that their levels of education and income far outstrip those of any other ethnic group.<table class="quoteright"><tr><th> &ldquo;An attraction of finding common ground as European-Americans is that it avoids the obvious pitfalls of a merely racial identity as &lsquo;whites&rsquo;&rdquo;. </th></tr></table>Professor Alba is candid enough to contrast the otherwise rapid and essentially uniform assimilation of Europeans with the very different experiences of other racial groups. Hispanic immigrants, for example, do not show anything like the same patterns of education, income, and intermarriage as Europeans, even after three generations and more, and blacks are even less a part of the American mainstream. To his credit, Prof. Alba refrains from the usual bromides about how these groups can be expected to be absorbed eventually, just as Poles and Italians have been.<br/>
   <br/>
          The United States has lost the old conviction that all newcomers must be made over in the same Anglo-Saxon image. Were this ever even theoretically possible for non-European immigrants, the disrepute into which the very effort has now fallen guarantees that assimilation will not take place.</p>
<p>          As for white ethnics, the findings of Prof. Alba&rsquo;s own research are always interesting and sometimes surprising. The widespread notion of the third generation trying to reestablish the ethnic identity that the previous generation had tried so hard to leave behind is apparently a myth. Interest in one&rsquo;s European origins can reawaken in members of any generation, but European ethnic identity declines steadily over time. Italians and Irishmen cling to their Europeanness more firmly than others but they, too, eventually melt into the pot.</p>
<p>          Another finding that runs counter to popular belief is that an interest in European ethnicity increases with education. Despite the common view that &ldquo;working-class ethnics&rdquo; are the staunchest remnants of Europe-in-America, according to Professor Alba it is the best educated who cultivate an interest in their European origins.</p>
<p>          Professor Alba also reports that it is women who are the guardians of European ethnicity. Without their determination to cook the foods and observe the celebrations of their ancestors, an occasional outburst of European sentiment from the father is unlikely to have much effect on children. Nevertheless, Professor Alba finds that in the case of ethnic intermarriage, when the husband insists on keeping his own ethnicity, his wife is likely to oblige. Swedish wives learn to cook ravioli and English ladies learn Irish jigs to please their husbands. In mixed marriages, children are more likely to identify with only a single ethnicity, and this is likely to be that of the father.</p>
<p>          Nevertheless, in all cases, Professor Alba&rsquo;s research demonstrates what everyone knows to be true  &mdash;  that European ethnicity is receding dramatically. Americans of European origin now tend to have what can be called &ldquo;symbolic&rdquo; or &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; ethnicity. For the most part, their Europeanness is something that is more a decoration than an essence, and is something they may deny or claim entirely as it suits them. European ethnicity has become so symbolic and so voluntary that virtually any white person can appropriate most any part of it for himself. Professor Alba quotes a notice from an Albany newspaper that sums up what European ethnicity now means in America: &ldquo;The German-American Club of Albany will observe St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day with a dinner-dance on March 19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>          Though Professor Alba does not explore this, a similar ethnic merging is taking place among Hispanics and, to a lesser degree, among Asians. Just as the musicians in a &ldquo;German&rdquo; band are as likely to be English, Irish, or even Czech as they are to be German, the members of a Salsa band may well be a mix of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Central Americans. Despite the current fashion of pooh poohing the melting pot, it has hardly gone out of business; there is simply a separate pot for each race.<br/>
        <table class="boxright"><tr><td><img src="../../../../ar/1991/01/barrow1.GIF" height="169" width="200" alt=""> </td></tr></table>It is in this context that Professor Alba hazards a few timid observations about a dawning pan-European ethnicity. As non-white immigrants pour into the country, and as old country identifications wane, whites increasingly see that the contours of the new melting-pot identity match those of the frontiers of Europe. Though Professor Alba anticipates a broad European-American ethnicity, he seems to be confused about what this means: &ldquo;An attraction of finding common ground as European Americans is that it avoids the obvious pitfalls of a merely racial identity as &ldquo;whites&rsquo;.&rdquo; Since the &ldquo;pitfalls&rdquo; of such an identity are so &ldquo;obvious,&rdquo; Professor Alba never explains what they might be.</p>
<p>          We are told that since a European-American identity is made up of the remnants of &ldquo;symbolic&rdquo; ethnicities, it is likely to be weak. Here again, in trying to distinguish between European-American identity and white consciousness, Professor Alba may be fashionable but he is mistaken. The racial fault lines in this country are only widening. As Poles, Hungarians, and old stock Dutchmen find that their interests are not those of blacks, Hispanics, or Filipinos, it will become increasingly clear that the culture uniting European-Americans cannot easily be separated from race.</p>
<p>          Professor Alba is right to acknowledge the decline of old-country ethnicity and has an inkling of what will replace it. But the European-American identity he describes will arrive with far greater strength and with far more consequences than Yale University Press is likely to concede.<br/>

		<p>European-American has a nice, non-racist ring to it. I think a lot of people who might feel uneasy about gathering under a banner that says &#8220;WHITE&#8221; would be willing to identify with a group of European-Americans. I&rsquo;m going to test that out on people I know who seem to be afraid to embrace their race.  </p>

Third world peoples are more of a problem because they are closer in number of generations to a culture where the best hunters and warriors had the most wives. Consequently, the best killers had the most children.<br/>

Populations that have practiced urban based civilization the longest usually have lower crime rates and higher average IQs because civilization rewards superior intelligence, while the criminal justice system of a civilized nation gradually removes those with criminal predispositions from the gene pool.  </p>

<p>I have said this for decades! There can NEVER be a melting pot with different RACES! Our Founders also knew this truth and they meant for America to be WHITE! What infuriates me the most (I heard Glenn Beck say this) that &#8220;we are all equal&#8221; and he was talking about all the RACES! How stupid does one have to be to know that is false! There is no such thing as equality among the races or civilizations. NONE!</p>

		<p>Great article.  The big downsides of looking at yourself as white first instead of your European ethnicity is that it gives white people the sense that they are a larger population than they are, lack of will to succeed and doesn&rsquo;t prepare us for life as a minority.  Bob Knight, the college basketball coach, said he rather have a poor kid play for his team than a rich kid because they have the hunger to succeed that the rich kid did not.  White people have had it too good and don&rsquo;t have the drive to succeed like past generations.  White people are the people everyone wants to be like and surpass.  Chris Rock joked that white people would not trade places with him even though he&rsquo;s rich and famous.  He was right.  No white woman goes to a plastic surgeron and says she wants epicanthal folds and a flat face.  But there are tons of East Asians who go to plastic surgerons to get surgery on their eyelids, noses, cheeks and chins to look white.  Wearing blonde hair pieces is common among Africans.  No white person dreams of Afro-textured hair.  Those are superficial examples of how non-white people try to immitate white people but not the other way around.  Some will say white people intimate black people&rsquo;s dress but t-shirts, baseball hats, jeans, boxers, briefs, athletic shoes etc. were all invented by Caucasians.  For decades white adults have tried to motivate white children into performing better in school by pointing to East Asian and Indian success.  It doesn&rsquo;t work because white people don&rsquo;t want to be them and in reality those East Asians and Indians are motivated to do good to surpass white people.  The reason Western Europeans were able to conquer the world during the Age of Exploration is because of the competition between white ethnicities.  When white people are the ones everyone including white people look to imitate and surpass then white people must re-identify with their ethnicity in order to breed competition and excellence.</p>

		<p>I prefer the pre-melting pot, narrow European identities to the larger, pan-European racial identity.  However, with most white Americans a confusing mix of English, German, Swedish, Cherokee, Italian, Polish, etc., its become impossible for most whites to identify with a single European group.  I myself comprise of six European groups and a small amount of Indian.  But I still think its a shame we&rsquo;ve had to adopt such a broad identity based solely on race.  Of course, a pan-white or White American identity is much better than the liberal identity with everyone, of every color and creed.</p>

		<p>What a lot of people do is identify with the ethnic origin of their last name.  For example, you might have a Scottish or German last name.</p>
<p>Of course, this does not have to be so narrow in scope because almost all of us are multiple ethnicities (the classic American mutt) and so we can celebrate multiple heritages.</p>
<p>In my case, basically every country in northern and western europe with an emphasis on the &#8220;Northmen&#8221; and their conquests from the British Isles all the way to the borders of Russia.  Wherever the Scandanavians/Germans went and mixed, I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>I think it would be useful for us to reorient ourselves as Euro-Americans so we can come out from under the evil whitey label.  We are more free to celebrate our heritage if it comes in ethnic packages.  Of course our identity as Americans suffers, but I see little alternative.  </p>
<p>(Ever notice how the latinos are now labelling all us white people as &#8216;Anglos?&rsquo;  Those idiots.  They think all white people are descended from the English.  I am part English, yes, but also about a dozen other things.  It&rsquo;s lke calling all latinos &#8216;mexicans.&rsquo;  See how angry a Dominican gets if you call him that!)</p>
<p>The leftists and non-white colonizers have decided that &#8220;American&#8221; must go, and they are working tirelessly to create a social justice utopia here that, unbeknownst to them, is basically Khmer Rouge communism in the offing.</p>
<p>As an aside, I went to the local Scottish day parade celebration recently.  A visiting troupe from Scotland was there also.  Marching prominently in the middle of the group, playing the big drum and wearing full scottish uniform - was a dark skinned man from India!  Inclusion gone amok!</p>

		<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s up to the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant founding majority to be the core and leadership of other Whites &amp; pro-White minorities. A pan-White identity robs the WASP of his identity, ancestral pride &amp; God-given right to rule the continent. I see this trend of preserving WASP integrity in the Tea Party.</p>

		<p>I also wanted to add that WASPs are not an ethnicity in the propper sense. Like Hispanics/Latinos they are a meta-ethnicity except WASPs are still undifferentiated. Their unrealized destiny is to form real ethnicities based on local WASP identites in Texas &amp; the South, Arizona, the Pacific NW and the Mid-West where a large enough long-settled local population can be supplemented with White migrants. At best America&rsquo;s future is Geographic Segregation IF the TP WASPs keep playing their cards right</p>

		<p>I think a pan-European &#8216;white&rsquo; identity is silly, because &#8216;Europeans&rsquo; have never considered themselves to be a single, monolithic &#8216;racial group.&rsquo; Contrary to what most people here seem to think, intra-European racial divisions ARE significant. </p>
<p>In American history, the racial &#8216;etiquette&rsquo; was developed around a basic Northwest European type, not a general &#8216;European&rsquo; type. Look at the founders of the US: All of them were Northwest Europeans. </p>
<p>I think a pan-European identity is wrong because it rejects the cultural heritage of Old-Stock Americans, such as myself, whose ancestors developed a more or less unified Northern European identity. </p>
<p>Can Amreners explain why mixing divergent European strains is a positive thing?</p>
<p>If, for instance, Italians mix en masse with Germans (or Italian-Americans and German-Americans, for that matter), then the rate of blondism will go WAY down; why would this be a good thing?</p>

		<p>Wow, so much that I want to say, but where to begin?</p>
<p>John Engelman, you are the poster I have argued with before about comparing the &#8220;superiority&#8221; of Ancient China with that of the West. You obviously come on here with a pro-Asian bias. Your ideas of Asians (including Indians) living harmoniously with whites are absurd, and you only promote them because you want to promote agendas, while they absolutely do whites no good at all.</p>
<p>In regards to Indians, are you speaking of all billion Indians in India?  I wish Amren posters would be more careful about how they lump Indians in with East Asians when it comes to civilization level.  Most Indians in India are low IQed which should be obvious.  Of course 1% of the population, (the ones that immigrate West) are going to be a biased sampling.</p>
<p>Another poster above mentioned how East Asians and Indian immigrants do well in school and appear smart compared to whites due to the fact that these groups are trying hard to outcompete whites.  YES! Bingo!  You hit the nail on the head. All this talk about how so many Indians are taking over engineering departments in Western universities is mute when you consider that when they are trying to play catch up with the West, OF COURSE this is necessary.  It by no means, means, that Indians are smarter than white people (maybe just a small percentage of course).</p>
<p>Going back to the main topic at hand, I to a certain degree, disagree with the whole &#8220;pan-European identity&#8221; idea. </p>
<p>I am from the South where most people (at least in states like Alabama) have very waspy backgrounds, meaning Irish, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, and English.  While I recognize Poles from Chicago, and Italians from New York as white, I still see them as somewhat foreign, especially when it comes to the idea of who I wish to date or marry.</p>
<p>I remember growing up, whenever I would tell my dad about a boy at school who was interested in me, my dad would immediately ask what the boy&rsquo;s last name was.  If it was something other than one of the British nationalities, my dad looked down on it to a degree. While he would tolerate German last names or other Northern European last names, Slavic or Southern European last names were out of the question for him. And it is not as if you run into many such names in the South anyways, unless you live in an urban setting, which is the type of setting I went to highschool in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think my dad was being close-minded at all.  I think he was being quite intelligent.  In fact, to this day he still does it with me. </p>
<p>While I accept all white ethnicities in this country as white, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I want to date or marry all of them.  Marriage is such an important decision, and it is best to marry someone who is very similar to you.  I myself prefer a Southern man who is Baptist. I don&rsquo;t want to marry an Italian Catholic from New York or a Lutheran Swede from Minnesota. I want my partner and I to be as similar as possible.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #5, it is almost impossible for the average American to identify with a single Euro ethnicity.</p>
<p>I would not even know where to begin as my bloodlines are all over the European map.  These were people that married people from neighboring European countries before they came to America! Many of us are in this same boat.</p>
<p>And do we ever really know for sure?  I am always reminded of that old credit card commercial where the son takes his Dad on a trip to Norway to discover their roots, and a visit to the townhall reveals that they were, um, &hellip; Swedish.  So off they go to Sweden and the search continues.</p>
<p>Do I identify with my surname (English) when there is more German?  What about the French and Polish, ignore it?  At the end of the day, it is just so much easier to say &#8220;American&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s what I understand, that&rsquo;s what I like, that&rsquo;s what I am.</p>

		<p>I can remember thirty years ago when White Americans were less homogenized than they are now.  A time when Irish spoke with an accent, when Italians lived in vibrant ethnic enclaves and many of America&rsquo;s small towns were populated with one dominant European ethnicity, creating a rich cultural tapestry on the landscape.  In those days you could many times still tell what someone&rsquo;s ethnicity was by looking at them.  So much has been lost because of the melting pot.  Interbreeding among different European ethnicities has caused many unique facial characteristics to be lost and I think people tend to look less healthy than they used to.  The overall White culture has devolved to the point it is little more than commercialization, watching black thugs play basketball or Hollywood movies.  I know White Americans had to have a single common identity and the Anglo-Saxon culture provided the impetus for this but perhaps it overreached just a little too far? </p>

<p>The quotes of the two white individuals above are examples of how divisive and provincial human nature is. Europe is a &#8216;white&rsquo; continent. Yet there are many countries and ethnicities. In the past several decades, we have witnessed the breakup of the USSR, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia further enriching the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; of the European landscape. An individual&rsquo;s or people&rsquo;s sense of identity aren&rsquo;t always rooted in race as we all know.</p>
<p>White nationalism is peculiar because it IS about race yet Europe itself is evident that race alone does not bind individuals to one another. Ultimately, white nationalism, however it is perceived, is a form of identity and an identity is a fluid concept subject to change with time and environment. </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how white nationalism evolves in the near and distant future&hellip;</p>

		<p> <i>&#8220;In mixed marriages, children are more likely to identify with only a single ethnicity, and this is likely to be that of the father.&#8221;</i><br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that is so.  In my own family, and almost all of those I know, the dominant identification is usually stonger with the mother&rsquo;s side.  That is where we usually went for Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc.  (But I am not speaking of &#8220;mixed&#8221; marriages.)</p>
<p>In mixed-race families, the identification of the children seems to be almost invariably with the &#8220;minority&#8221; side, whether it is the father or mother (as with Obama). But in Obama&rsquo;s case, his mother didn&rsquo;t like or identify with whites anyway. This leaning toward color wan&rsquo;t a decision Obama had to make; his white-hating mother already made it for him.  (Can you blame her for hating her white ancestors when her father named her &#8220;Stanley&#8221;?)</p>

		<p>The melting pot phenomenon is not unique to America.  It is the norm in all White Indo-European Christian countries.</p>
<p>In England, do you find some people clinging to a Saxon identity and others clinging to a Norman identity?  No, they long ago merged into a new ethnicity, English.</p>
<p>In the Scottish Highlands, do some identify as Irish, others as Picts?  No, they long ago merged into a new ethnicity, Highland Scot.</p>
<p>Consider the Hugenout diaspora.  Those who moved to Germany became Germans, those who moved to England became English, those who moved to South Africa became Afrikaaners, those who moved to America became White Americans (Francis Marion, Paul Rivere, John Sevier)</p>
<p>Or consider the Irish Catholics who moved to France or Spain after English conquest of Ireland- they successfully turned into Frenchmen and Spaniards, which is why France has had a President named MacMahon and Chile a President named O&rsquo;Higgins.</p>
<p>Or consider the ethno-genesis of the Irish Catholics themselves  -  can you find a single one who can say for sure that he is pure Gaelic, or pure Old English, or pure Norse - or are they all a mixture of all these?</p>
<p>I could go on and on.  Sometimes it takes longer, sometimes it happens quickly, but White Indo-European Christian people placed in proximity to one another merge to form geographically based ethnic groups.  The latest such group to emerge is White Americans.  Crevecuer saw the early stages of the emergence of &#8220;this new man, the American&#8221; who, as Paine said in Common Sense, considered &#8220;not England alone, but all of Europe our mother country.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to Middle Easterners.  For 4000 years, Jews have mostly married other Jews.  For 1000 years, the Druze have almost exclusivley married other Druze.  Roma (Gypsies) mostly marry other Gypsies.  And the list goes on.</p>
<p>I realize the name &#8220;White&#8221; has its drawbacks as a term to describe people of European ancestry, since Europeans are not the only white-skinned people in the world.  But Euro-American sounds stuffy and PC, just like African American.  White flows off the tongue easily and naturally, just like Black.</p>

		<p>I come from three White ethnicities; none of them Anglo-Saxon or Protestant.  That said it was the WASP ethic of America that drew my ancestors here.  I could not go back to my families&rsquo; originating countries and converse in their tongue with them.  Nor am I familiar with their histories.  </p>
<p>Indeed, I think I speak for the vast majority of Americans like me when I say that I am most familiar with British culture and traditions, revere British common law and feel tied more culturally, spiritually and affectionately to Great Britain.  </p>
<p>That said, I do understand Anglo-Americans like Courtney who want to preserve their own ethnic genetic heritage as much as possible, though I wonder if the need for it is as strong as it once was. However as a &#8220;Heinz 57&#8221; American I WANT all the different White European groups perfectly preserved in their own national settings.  Otherwise, it just wouldn&rsquo;t be Europe for me.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re too kind, #15. Tho&rsquo; referring to those posters as &#8220;provincial&#8221; IS an insult in my book. And an apt one at that. National origin, at least as far as it&rsquo;s concerned with racial identity, means very little. Various European groups moved about the continent fairly often througout the centuries, this fact is well-documented in several books on the subject.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve known Scots and Irish that were dark enough to scare Courtney and her neighbors, I&rsquo;ve known Italians and Iranians that wouldn&rsquo;t have been out of place on the set of the Sound of Music. Both my parents were blonde, grey-eyed Nordics, my paternal grandfather was (wholly, documented) German and gave my brother (but not my dad or my uncle)his dark brown eyes. My late sister inherited her huge blue eyes from my maternal grandmother. And so it goes&hellip; </p>
<p>  It&rsquo;s fine to have preferrences for a certain &#8220;type&#8221;, so long as you don&rsquo;t relegate unalike others within your racial group to the scrapheap. You might take a fancy to someone of a &#8220;type&#8221; that you prefer, only to find out later on that they, in spite of appearances, have substantial non-Europid bloodlines. And these differences can, and do, turn up in the offspring of such a union. </p>
<p>  Vet a potential partner, if you must. But don&rsquo;t depend on something as insubstantial as a surname, or a claimed national origin. As my dark-eyed Grandpa used to say, there&rsquo;s a reason why blacks have English last names, and not German ones.</p>

		<p>Perhaps, a large percentage of European Americans have mixed backgrounds; if that is the case, then you should be proud of that and I am not discouraging that.  At the same time, don&rsquo;t insult those of us who are still of purer backgrounds who wish to preserve it. There is nothing wrong with that, and there are a large number of Americans that still have backgrounds that are somewhat pure to one degree or another.  Don&rsquo;t assume all Americans have mixed backgrounds just because you yourself do.</p>
<p>Some of you are trying to justify your arguments further by talking about how &#8220;everyone in European is a mixed ethnicity&#8221;.  Sure the English have different strains, as do the Germans and Spanish.  But it is ignorant to say that there isn&rsquo;t a certain mix that makes an English person English which is very different from the mix that makes a German, German.  Southern Europeans overall are still very different from Central Europeans, who are different from the people of the British Isles etc&hellip;</p>
<p><br/>
It is foolish to encourage Europeans everywhere to mix it up and blur any regional distinctions.  Regional distinctions are what makes white people so interesting, and YES they still exist in America too.  </p>
<p>I think some people on here who are coming up with these whopper stories about how &#8220;everyone in Europe is mixed anyways&#8221; and how white people everywhere should &#8220;mix it up&#8221;, are coming from a biased standpoint just because they themselves have mixed backgrounds.</p>
<p>Anonymous at 1:42 AM,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is you are trying to do, but you have no  business dictating to me about who I wish to marry.  Most people in the South have British ancestory, so I won&rsquo;t have a hard time finding a man who is a lot like me. There is nothing wrong with wishing to marry somebody who is very similar to you. Don&rsquo;t try to make me out to seem closeminded about all this.  I already said that Italians in New York and Poles in Chicago are white, but why does that mean I should have to marry them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what your point is, but you are being very judgmental just because I am particular about who I wish to marry.  And what does the fact that there are dark Scots and blonde Iranians have to do with this?  Yes, I know all this.  Blondes are the exception to the rule in Iran.  You are trying to make it sound as if everyone in Iran is identical to a German.  And of course there are many people with dark hair and dark eyes in the British Isles.  When did I say that I don&rsquo;t accept them as my own?</p>
<p>And then you start hinting at this garbage about Southerners and British people intermarrying with other races. Really?</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you have a problem with me deciding who I wish to marry. Just because you have a mixed background, don&rsquo;t make me into a bad guy for wanting to marry a Baptist guy from the South who is waspy like I am.  What kind of a hateful person are you?  Don&rsquo;t worry, &hellip;.I won&rsquo;t have any problem at all finding a guy who is like me in the South.</p>

		<p>Courtney, you&rsquo;re free to marry whomever you want, but I disagree with some of what you say.  The South is easily equally Germanic to British and yes, there are a lot of similar strains to the two: mostly strains of France (Franks, Huegenots, etc) and Celts with Roman influence as well.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to be realistic about race and quite another to be so concerned about being &#8220;pure&#8221;.  Many of us Southerners also share mixed race DNA - how many people with Scots-Irish ancestry also can claim Cherokee or some other native ancestry?  I maybe 80% Scots-Irish but I can&rsquo;t help that 20% Cherokee (in spite of the fact you couldn&rsquo;t tell by looking at me).  </p>
<p>I hope you know you&rsquo;re Southern &#8220;pure&#8221; heritage and there&rsquo;s not a slave in your lineage back there somewhere :)</p>

<p>And this is something I wanted to adress in my other post but didn&rsquo;t.  In the above quote, the anonymous poster that I am arguing with, very quietly tries to insult my people by hinting at these myths about us intermixing with blacks.</p>
<p>Why is it that whenever these discussions come up, people like you are allowed to insult my people (the WASPY founding stock of this country), but people like me get accused of being divisive if I dare say anything negative about an Italian or a Polish person?</p>
<p>Let me answer you now. Black people are likely to have English last names because those were the names of their slavemasters. The English were also the ones who founded this country.</p>
<p>For all the people on here who enjoy making these sweeping insults towards the founding stock English, let me ask you why your own people didn&rsquo;t start their own Italian, German, or Russian colony somewhere?</p>
<p>As I said before, I accept all white ethnicities in America as white, and I respect all of them.  But I am tired of how some of you get away with bashing the founding stock of this country while those of us descended from the founding stock aren&rsquo;t allowed to say anything about you.</p>

<p>Okay, this is where people are misunderstanding my argument, but I am going to read the rest of your post&hellip;.</p>

<p>You sound very similar to me.  I am very proud of my Native American ancestory as I am my Scottish and Irish ancestory.  Overall, my Native American ancestory is miniscule, and I consider myself white.  Why does any of this mean that I shouldn&rsquo;t consider myself mostly British if that is what I am? I don&rsquo;t know of any other strains in me other than Irish, Scottish, and English when looking at the European side (which is like 90%).</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you know you&rsquo;re Southern &ldquo;pure&rdquo; heritage and there&rsquo;s not a slave in your lineage back there somewhere :)&#8221;</p>
<p>You are mocking me again while misunderstanding my argument.  What did I write above that gave people the impression that it is my duty to keep my bloodline 100% pure?  That wasn&rsquo;t what I was saying.  All I was saying was just because somebody on here may be Polish, German, Scottish, Italian, (an equal mixture of everything), that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the rest of us are.  I can safely say that I am British American.  My family has done extensive research to prove this.</p>
<p>Maybe you are mistaking my preference in a marriage partner for &#8220;wanting to stay pure&#8221;.  Not necessarily. I have dated Italian Catholic guys from New York and other kinds of guys, and I have found I just don&rsquo;t have much in common with them. Maybe you can blame my dad for how he raised me, which I don&rsquo;t find any fault in whatsoever. However, overall I DO think it is good that Europe has maintained its regional differences, and I also want people to realize that America has distinct identities as well, even if it is to a lesser extent.</p>

<p>I think his point is that the British are as &#8220;Germanic&#8221; as the Germans (not &#8220;German&#8221;).  I am not sure I agree with that though if you view Celtic as different than Germanic since the British seem to be more Celtic than Anglo-Saxon based on DNA.  On the other hand, southern and western Germans do have a lot of continental Celtic ancestry mixed in with their Nordic ancestry too.</p>

		<p>The British are not an ethnic group,they comprise of four separate peoples,three of whom (Welsh,Scots,and Irish) are more closely related to each other than they are to the English,who form the largest single nation in the british geographic region.Courtney is mistaken in identifying them as a single group.Quite apart from the divergent origins of the English,whom Americans invariably call &#8220;British&#8221;,there is very little commonality between the Irish proper,and the so-called Scotch-Irish who are not ethnically Irish,and only partly Scottish.Furthermore since when have the Irish been WASP.I think European American is a safer,if unsatisfactory term all round.</p>

<p>Once again, just because you have a mixed background of which you may not be able to define a particular group, don&rsquo;t assume that all of us are exactly like you.  I am not going to call myself &#8220;European American&#8221;.  Nobody on here has any right to dictate to me who I should marry and what I should categorize myself as.  Why is everyone so sensitive about it?  Get over it.</p>
<p>My ancestors (when speaking of the Scottish and Irish), just like most peoples&rsquo; ancestors in the South, were actually displaced English Protestants living in Scotland and Ireland, for the most part at least.  They were very different from the Catholic Irish who came later. So I think it is safe to call myself &#8220;British&#8221;.  Even if your assumption was correct, I would call myself British anyways, as ALL the people in the British Isles could, in fact, be treated as their own subgroup just like other groups in Europe can be treated as subgroups.</p>
<p>I think people on here just want to assume that EVERYBODY has mixed up backgrounds just like they do, and then when someone like me doesn&rsquo;t, and I am proud about my more &#8220;pure&#8221; background almost monolithically coming from the British Isles, then you people think you can point fingers at me calling me &#8220;closeminded&#8221;.  You are the ones who are closeminded.  Just because you have a mixed background, don&rsquo;t assume the rest of us do.  Get over it.  I am NOT changing my viewpoints.  </p>
<p>This is about marrying someone similar to me (just by marrying a Southern guy in Alabama who is Baptist, by default he will more than likely be ethnically similar to me, which is what people on here fail to understand), and it is also about what I wish to call myself.  If an Italian American came on here saying they want to marry another Italian American, I doubt not a word would be said about it from all of you.  If someone from Minnesota who has a mixed Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish ancestory wanted to call themselves &#8220;Scandinavian American&#8221;, I doubt any of you would be saying anything.</p>
<p>It is when us wasps ( I wasn&rsquo;t the one who invented to term) show any sort of pride that it is considered hateful.  Get over it!</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t misconstrue what I am saying or put words in my mouth.  I am not saying white Americans of all ethnicities shouldn&rsquo;t work together for a common goal.  I never said other white ethnicities aren&rsquo;t white.  I never said mixed European white Americans shouldn&rsquo;t be proud of themselves.  I never said we aren&rsquo;t all in the same fight together.</p>
<p> I am talking about intimate matters (who I choose as a partner etc&hellip;and how I wish to define myself as a white American).  Some of you sound like Big Brother Socialist Liberals&hellip;.&#8221;no Courtney, it is hateful for you to choose a mate from Alabama who is similar to you in religion and culture and ethnicity&hellip;.you MUST marry an Italian from New York or a Polish person from Chicago, so that ALL white Americans can &#8216;mix it up&rsquo;. &#8220;</p>
<p>Seriously, I can&rsquo;t believe this. Leave me alone.  Why aren&rsquo;t any of you adressing the other poster who made similar comments? Do you just like picking on female posters on here?  I am finished with this discussion until you involve his comments also.  I am tired of being harrassed over this.</p>

﻿ Old Timer you have me at a distinct disadvantage . I never went to college, never wanted to . I am one of of those dull factory workers shown in the new issue of the AR magazine . But once upon a time I was a voracious reader.Even now I collect old publications and a lot of new rightwing stuff. These days I just go to the index and find an interesting subject and read that . No one can go into an old book and change it for political correctness&rsquo;s sake . A real plus over computers .  And in high-school we were always told blond was dominant.Perhaps it is because there used to be so many blonds down here . Here&rsquo;s my original post which I decided not to submit, but maybe now it would show you exactly where I am coming from .  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  I think it should be brought up that the Balkans have been a divided region since long before there ever was a Yugoslavia . It was made that way because of Muslim conquerors . Another thing too, in the 50s we were always told blond is a dominant gene . I know that is not considered to be the common logic today .But it would seem to be true at least in my case . In my youth I was very blond . I married a relatively dark woman of Welsh descent and 1/68 Cherokee . Her Cherokee grandmother was not that long ago . She used to really look like an Indian at 19, when we married . Both of our children are very blond . I&rsquo;ve also seen on the net that I have a <br/>
Cherokee grandmother way back up the line . Plus, I have a Florida Spaniard grandmother that is within memory for my father. She dressed like a Spanish woman back in the 1930&rsquo;s, she was relatively dark (compared to most Anglo-Saxons) I would have to assume . I can safely assume most of the rest of my ancestors are from the British Isles . Based on our name and the research of our family genealogist, we are Anglicized Danish from the Viking era . My point is, this blond thing just keeps coming back out .It would be interesting to have a DNA test, but they are very expensive . Especially with the slumping dollar . Unfortunately it&rsquo;s doubtful I will get to see if it follows through with grand children because of circumstances beyond my control .  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   I would also like to add that you have blond, blue eyed, Inuits in Greenland apparently from Viking influence . You also have blond .blue eyed people in remote areas of the Middle East, apparently from where Alexander the Great rolled through (where did I read that ? Maybe Nat-Geo ?) . Like I said before, I am not a learned man, But I am thinking, eradicating this blond gene may be much easier said than done . Not that I am in favor of risking eradicating it .   </p>

		<p>Part of the problem is that the meaning of the word &#8220;American&#8221; is racially diluted. In its original formulation, &#8220;American&#8221; could be thought of as the North American analogue to &#8220;Afrikaner&#8221;-distinguishing the people of white European stock and culture from the indigenous peoples and the slaves. Like Americans, the Afrikaners include a mix of European ethnicities (mainly Dutch, German, and French, but also including celtic Scotsmen and Irishmen), though with fewer southern and Eastern Europeans. I would say that during the twenty century, before &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; took off, there was an American nationality, distinct from other white nationalities (even the English), just as the Afrikaners were distinct from their cousins in Europe. Unfortunately, the word &#8220;American&#8221; is now diluted to where it is little more than a geographic designation, such that now school children are taught that &#8220;real Americans&#8221; are descendants of the aboriginal tribes of the continent, and that Mexican mestizos (who are primarily descended from indigenous tribes) are more American than the founders of this country!</p>

<p>Sardonicus, there is not a word in your post I disagree with. It seems there are others on here who disagree with the first half of your last sentence. I don&rsquo;t know who is being more divisive, myself or those who are arguing with me, telling me I can&rsquo;t marry who I want to or be proud of my heritage while we are in this fight.  I agree that we should all work together and see the big picture.  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I should be forced to marry an Italian Catholic from New York who has nothing in common with me. If I was stranded on an island with a colony of blacks, arabs, Indians, and Chinese people, and there was just one white Italian man among them, then yes, I would marry him.  But we are hardly in those dire situations just yet. I find some of the comments directed at me laughable. Am I not allowed any sort of regional or ethnic pride?  I never said that it comes before preserving the white race. Gee whiz.</p>

﻿ &#8220;Old Timer you have me at a distinct disadvantage . I never went to college, never wanted to . I am one of of those dull factory workers shown in the new issue of the AR magazine &hellip;. Another thing too, in the 50s we were always told blond is a dominant gene . I know that is not considered to be the common logic today .But it would seem to be true at least in my case .&#8221;<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>It was never at any time &#8220;common logic&#8221; that blondness was dominant.  (But persistent, yes. See below.)</p>
<p>From your post, I can conclude any one of three things:<br/>
*Either your school was extremely deficient and your ill-informed teacher gave you the lesson upside down.</p>
<p>*Over the course of time you have become confused and remember the rule backwards.</p>
<p>*You have a misconception of what is meant (in biololgical terms)  by Dominant and Recessive genes. That&rsquo;s just an arbitrary term assigned by Mendl.  (Many blacks, for instance, think it means their genes are &#8220;stronger&#8221;. That&rsquo;s nonsense. It doesn&rsquo;t! In fact, quite the reverse.)</p>
<p>As for eradicating the blond gene, I think that will be much more difficult than you fear, because it is capable of &#8220;hiding&#8221; and re-emerging  many generations later from those who show no sign of having it (as with those blond Eskimos you mention in Greenland).  On the other hand, the &#8220;dominant&#8221; gene is actually more vulnerable because if it is there, its presence will be known. It cannot hide.</p>
<p>That is why a [pure] white mother cannot have a black baby. But a  [presumably] &#8220;black&#8221; mother could have a white baby.</p>
<p>PS. That was an interesting story about your family.</p>

<p>No they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The so called Scots-Irish were Anglo descended people from the heavily Anglo Scottish border regions of Ayrshie and Northumbira. </p>
<p>When they went to Ireland they intermixed heavily with the locals,before going to America where they freely identified themselves as Irish (setting up Irish fraternal groups like the Friendly Sons Of St.Patrick). A lot of them were Catholics who converted to Protestantism upon their arrival to the colonies.</p>
<p>They are no more different than the Scandinavian descended Irish people in the former Viking settlements of Dublin,Waterford and Wexford.</p>

<p>At this, Tso-Chin says,  &#8220;So true.  Over time, through intermarriage and lack of self-confidence, they disappeared as a distinct and unique race!&#8221;</p>
<p>Muhammed pipes in, &#8220;As their numbers diminished it became very uncool to be White especially since Big Media, Big Academia, Big Business and Big Government were against them too.  The media encouraged everyone to race mix, so it became quite fashionable to be Hybrid Tan and to have Hybrid Tan children.  After all, Hybrid Tans were a blank slate without historical baggage upon whom the social engineers pinned all their hopes and dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another example of a post from a self-righteous white person on here who is misunderstanding my argument. In fact, I think that the above quote is a pretty hateful way to distort my logic. We aren&rsquo;t children. I don&rsquo;t remember anywhere above, where I was promoting myself. I promote my race first after God and family (which includes *gasp* having pride in my British heritage), my Southern heritage second, and then other things fall into place after that.</p>
<p>If y&rsquo;all want to start a mob mentality and come after Courtney for expressing pride in her heritage then I don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with this website any longer.  This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Identifying with your ethnic ancestry first at the same time acknowledging you are apart of a white European whole doesn&rsquo;t mean you work against or take advantage of other white ethnic groups.

<p>Finally someone who makes sense. Why aren&rsquo;t the same posters who are coming after me, going after the poster above who was saying white people should unite with East Asians and Indians?  Who is doing more to hurt our race here?</p>
<p>Conan, did you read my entire argument above? We can go back and forth on what ethnicity the Scotch-Irish were, and in the end I am STILL calling myself British American. </p>
<p>I am glad all of you are losing sleep over what Courtney on American Renaissance values in a marriage partner and the fact that she takes pride in the European ethnic group she is descended from.  </p>
<p>What am I doing to hurt our race?  I have never dated a nonwhite, I am a strong advocate for the rights of white males in my work place when goofy white feminists attack them, I donate to websites like this, I am looking for a suitable white mate to have lots of children with, among other things that I could list, but that isn&rsquo;t good enough for all of you.</p>
<p>I am sick of the abuse that people like me endure on here.  Go after the white men on this website who date Asian women.  Go after white women who date black men. Go after liberals who post on here to cause trouble.  Why are you wasting your time with me?  What am I doing that is so dangerous?</p>

		<p>Professor Alba is right. Whites can only come together if they go back to their root. Euro-Americans or European-Americans is what we Whites are and should be known under such label and be proud of it.<br/>
It makes no sense to try to go back to the old divisions of who among us is whiter, or purer than the other or a better Christian like Courtney (#15) above claims.</p>
<p><br/>
Quote:</p>
<p>In American history, the racial &lsquo;etiquette&rsquo; was developed around a basic Northwest European type, not a general &lsquo;European&rsquo; type. Look at the founders of the US: All of them were Northwest Europeans.</p>
<p>I think a pan-European identity is wrong because it rejects the cultural heritage of Old-Stock Americans, such as myself, whose ancestors developed a more or less unified Northern European identity.</p>
<p>If, for instance, Italians mix en masse with Germans (or Italian-Americans and German-Americans, for that matter), then the rate of blondism will go WAY down; why would this be a good thing?</p>
<p>Courtney lives in a fantasy world and probably hasn&rsquo;t moved past a few miles from her house. Her claims of northern European identity/superiority are just claims. The fact is that the British and most other Europeans including the Germans were under Roman rule for centuries and that largely European identity and civilization is the product of two great countries: Ancient Italy and Greece.</p>
<p>Courtney should also know that there aren&rsquo;t that many Nordics in Europe and here in the USA  to save the demise of the White race.</p>
<p>Matter of fact all the little Northern Countries: Norway,Sweden,Danmark  etc.etc. with 4-5 million people in each of them are now almost taken over by  millions of non-Whites who are inter-marrying very rapidly with the local &#8220;blond&#8221; population and actually replacing it with a mulatto population. Sorry,Courtney,but that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>You cannot joke anymore about the &#8220;dark&#8221; or lesser than pure Whites Southern Europeans.</p>
<p><br/>
 <br/>
Additionally, it&rsquo;s well known that blond or non-blond women from Nordic Countries flock to sunny Southern Europe to find adventure and love, to marry and remain there and now more so as there are no more borders within the EU. </p>
<p>Courtney should also know that an Italian, Columbus with a Spanish crew discovered this continent and not &#8220;her&#8221; people.  Yes, the British came when they found out how to get here. The Spaniards came too and they possessed about half of what is now the USA.</p>
<p>My advice to people who think like this person is the following: put all the &#8220;Northern Europeans&#8221; together and save the White race and see how far you go. We&rsquo;re clearly divided and our &#8220;colored&#8221; enemies are all united against us. Blame Courtney and her  &#8220;old stock American&#8221; friends.  </p>

<p>You owe me an apology. You just quoted somebody else&rsquo;s post and then accused me of Nordic surpremacist ideas that that other poster wrote about.  When did I myself ever say Nordics were superior?  I never went into any of that stuff in my OWN posts.  You quoted someone else&rsquo;s post and then falsely accused me of saying things I never said.</p>
<p>I never said anything about America being a Northwest European country nor did I ever say anything about Southern Europeans being inferior. Somebody else above said all that. In fact I have been spending most of my time on here saying just the opposite in order to protect myself against false claims on here the whole time.  But so much for that.</p>
<p>I want everybody to read what you just wrote and then read everything I wrote before, and then come back and tell me who is being divisive, you or me.</p>
<p>Not only have you accused me of Nordic supremacist ideas that I don&rsquo;t even have, but you have also proved that you yourself are a Southern European supremacist.  The sad thing is is that more people on here are going to attack me for things I never said while ignoring the divisiveness you portray.</p>

You might take a fancy to someone of a &ldquo;type&rdquo; that you prefer, only to find out later on that they, in spite of appearances, have substantial non-Europid bloodlines.  And these differences can, and do, turn up in the offspring of such a union. &hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, I like the way Richard McCulloch has framed the issue; to paraphrase him: Racial integrity is a zero-sum matter, it&rsquo;s something you either have or don&rsquo;t have. You cannot &#8216;almost have&rsquo; racial integrity. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything against non-Northwest European Caucasoids, but I don&rsquo;t want them to mix with us. If they mix with us, then we will cease to be us. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. No, I don&rsquo;t want all Europeans to freely intermix, creating some sort of pan-European hybrid type with no secondary regional and/or ethnic characteristics. What would be the point of this? </p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a legitimate question, because I honestly believe that many Amreners actually &#8216;encourage&rsquo; such a development&hellip; Presumably, the central benefit of the hybrid type would be the solidification of a common so-called &#8216;White identity&rsquo;, which would be useful for competing in the ever-intensifying world of American identity politics. </p>
<p>The problem, though, is that this denies the racial interests of Northwest Europeans who, although similar to, are not perfectly compatible with non-Northwest Europeans. Furthermore, pan-European &#8216;Whiteness&rsquo; does NOT have a basis in history; what do you think the 1924 Immigration Act   &mdash;   the same act which is strangely praised by Amreners   &mdash;   actually did? It discriminated in FAVOR of Northwest Europeans, who at that time were still seen as representing the founding and guiding racial element of American society. </p>
<p>If you agree with Prof. Rushton, then intra-Europeans are not only meaningful, they are essential for creating more stable bonds. It is simply a matter of like clinging to like in an effort to guarantee higher survivability. Or, among Amreners, it is a case of &#8216;similar&rsquo; clinging to &#8216;even more similar&rsquo;. </p>

The same argument has been presented against Jews by anti Semites.

		<p>Courtney, I&rsquo;m looking into this thread now with very little light, so I&rsquo;m not going to reread past posts. However, if I somehow attributed to you what somebody else said I honestly apologize. In the heat of a discussion it does happen.</p>
<p>What I was trying to say is that it&rsquo;s important, extremely important, for us of European descent to be united regardless of where in Europe we originated from and whether of not some of us are the genetic product of hundreds of years of conquests which invariably have injected in some of us a non-caucasian DNA or profess a modified,reinterpreted Christian faith.</p>
<p>The main thing is that we all consider ourselves Europeans and  uphold the greatness of the European civilization.</p>
<p>With these premises I favor calling ourselves either Euro-Americans or European Americans. Peace.<br/>

<p>100% true. These people will never assimilate. Actually, in the USA there will never be any assimilation-integration between Whites and those from the third-world and our &#8220;leaders&#8221; in Congress are still talking of Diversity and the benefits derived from it. About a moth ago I crossed the George Washington Bridge in upper Manhattan,NYC to look for something in New Jersey, a ten minute-drive. I  found myself in Palisades Park. I expected to be in a White City or mostly White instead I found a City(30 years ago was White) almost totally taken over by Koreans. Korean Banks,Stores,all Korean. I only saw a White police Officer.!</p>
<p>Where all the Whites went? And this is the multiracial society our SOB in Washington,D.C. want us to embrace?</p>
<p><br/>
If we don&rsquo;t close the borders forever to non-Whites and if we don&rsquo;t start mass deportations Whites will have no future here in USA or elsewhere in their nations. </p>
<p>Mass deportation? It will not happen unless we start a liberation movement. </p>

<p>The same argument has been presented against Jews by anti Semites. Nevertheless, I have never read, heard of or observed Jews or Asians aggressively driving white Gentiles out of workplaces, business, and schools. What does happen is that they usually perform better so they achieve more, and dominate positions requiring superior intelligence. <br/>

		<p>   Old Timer, I believe I had already, more or less conceded to you . Please do not judge my high school by me, as I would certainly not be the standard bearer . I think I more or less said that too . We had a wonderful school and we were deficient  &mdash;   in funds . I believe we were being denied Federal funds because our courageous teachers and parents were refusing to capitulate to Brown vs Board . They held it off as long as they could but in the fall of 1970 that infamous ruling was fully implemented . We jumped from a &#8220;C&#8221; class school that had to play a &#8220;B&#8221; and even an &#8220;A&#8221; schedule because there were very few schools as small as ours&rsquo; that even had sports teams, to a 4A school . Out of a graduating class of 120, 15 were white . I was one of those 15 . I had two classes in which all of the other students and the teachers were black . Lucky for me it was not outside the South . It was bearable, for the most part the black students were not completely hostile . I was used to being around them already . The black high school could be seen from my house . We used to go over and play them in basketball or fly kites with them just for the fun of it in the 1960s . I was actually somewhat liberal then . But all in all, after 1970, high school became a complete joke . And in those classes where the teacher was black, the black students were in charge . I am just a little curious about this high school you attended that was so immersed in Mendl and genetics ? I appreciate all of the good info you&rsquo;ve given me but I have one more question . Have you ever seen a pre WW2 Volvo or Saab documentary ? They show up from time to time on the educational networks . Everyone in it is platinum blond . They look like the Eloi in H.G. Well&rsquo;s &#8220;The Time Machine.&#8221; Well at least in the 1962 movie . I&rsquo;ve read the book, over and over but it has all been 40 years ago, maybe I am confused on that too . How do you explain this ? All of the stark blonds in pre WW2 Sweden ?</p>

<p>Lol, yes, the fellow falsely attributed my post to you. I&rsquo;ve addressed his rather ridiculous comments below&hellip;</p>
<p><br/>

<p>&#8220;&hellip; Courtney lives in a fantasy world and probably hasn&rsquo;t moved past a few miles from her house. Her claims of northern European identity/superiority are just claims. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Northern European identity in AMERICA is a historical fact, not a &#8216;claim&rsquo;. And it has very little to do with ancient Greco-Roman history. It was present at the FOUNDING of the USA and continued up until the 20th century.</p>
<p>Ever read Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s thoughts on &#8216;race&rsquo;? I can assure you that when he refers to &#8216;Whites&rsquo; he isn&rsquo;t talking about Sicilians&hellip;</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;&hellip; Courtney should also know that there aren&rsquo;t that many Nordics in Europe and here in the USA to save the demise of the White race. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What does that mean? If there were more Nordics, what would they do? How would &#8216;enough of them&rsquo; be capable of &#8216;saving&rsquo; the White race? Would they all interbreed with Southern Euros types but still predominate genetically such that basic Northern Euro appearances/traits would remain on the surface? </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any problem with all European groups being saved and gaining control over their territories, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply complete and thorough intermixture. You seem to be making the assumption that: &#8216;Saving the White Race = All Whites intermarrying,&rsquo; and this is just simply false&hellip;</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;&hellip; Courtney should also know that an Italian, Columbus with a Spanish crew discovered this continent and not &ldquo;her&rdquo; people. Yes, the British came when they found out how to get here. The Spaniards came too and they possessed about half of what is now the USA. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lol, what is the point of such chest-pounding? I&rsquo;ve never denied the accomplishments of non-Northwest Europeans, and I don&rsquo;t have anything against them. But, my Northwest European identity is very important to me. Forgive me for having pride in the culture that my ancestors created. </p>
<p>A bit insecure, are we?</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;&hellip; My advice to people who think like this person is the following: put all the &ldquo;Northern Europeans&rdquo; together and save the White race and see how far you go. We&rsquo;re clearly divided and our &ldquo;colored&rdquo; enemies are all united against us. Blame Courtney and her &ldquo;old stock American&rdquo; friends. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that phrase again, &#8216;saving the White race.&rsquo; Look, the &#8216;White race&rsquo; (really RACES, as there are clearly multiple racial groups indigenous to Europe; they are not &#8216;subraces&rsquo; or whatever) can be &#8216;saved&rsquo; without complete intermixture between all different Euro groups. You keep assuming that pan-European whiteness is the final and ONLY solution to our problems, and you&rsquo;re simply wrong. Besides, such an identity NEVER existed in history anyways; what makes you think it can work today? People will ALWAYS branch out and create new divisions, it&rsquo;s just part of life. People are attracted to those with whom they share the most in common; this applies just as much within the gigantic macro &#8216;White race&rsquo; as it does without. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that there cannot be some sort of solidarity or broad coalition against multiculturalism, and I agree that, generally, Euro-Whites share certain basic interests in opposing this. But since when do &#8216;shared interests&rsquo; automatically generate compatible mates?</p>

1. The Worldwide Pattern of IQ Scores. East Asians average higher on IQ tests than Whites, both in the U. S. and in Asia, even though IQ tests were developed for use in the Euro-American culture. Around the world, the average IQ for East Asians centers around 106; for Whites, about 100&hellip;<br/>
 <br/>
4. Brain Size Differences. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) find a correlation of brain size with IQ of about 0.40. Larger brains contain more neurons and synapses and process information faster. Race differences in brain size are present at birth. By adulthood, East Asians average 1 cubic inch more cranial capacity than Whites&hellip;<br/>
 <br/>
5. Trans-Racial Adoption Studies. Race differences in IQ remain following adoption by White middle class parents. East Asians grow to average higher IQs than Whites.<br/>

In a review of nearly 100 studies of South Asian/North African IQ, Richard Lynn has shown that although IQ scores of Sephardi Jews are lower on average than those of Ashkenazim, they are higher than those of the populations that surrounded them historically. Clearly we are dealing with something deeply rooted in the Jewish past&hellip;<br/>
 <br/>
The estimated Ashkenazi mean of 110 translates to a ratio of 11:10 in Europe and the United States.<br/>

		<p> Unfortunately, large numbers of Asian immigrants can start demanding group rights and practice racial politics with a vengeance. I&rsquo;m not saying this happens in every case, but our affirmative action system gives minorities special access to employment and jobs. Minorities are encouraged to be aggrieved &ldquo;victims&rdquo;. The doctrine of multiculturalism encourages non assimilation of non European immigrants.</p>

		<p>Allisio Rex, I accept your apology, but you said stuff in your post that was pretty irresponsible. </p>
<p>All I ever came on here and said was that I want to marry a man who is as culturally similar to me as possible. If I marry a Baptist man from Alabama, chances are he will be ethnically similar to me by default.</p>
<p>This was the only issue I was in disagreement with over the pan-European movement idea. Yes, we are all in this together as whites, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it is necessary for all whites to mix together in regards to which whites they choose to breed with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why everyone jumped all over me for that. It is nobody&rsquo;s business to dictate to me who I wish to seek in a marriage partner and it hardly means I dislike other whites.</p>
<p>Then you came along and accused me of something terrible by quoting me as saying something from someone else&rsquo;s post.  It was so bad that now, if you haven&rsquo;t noticed, others have joined your bandwagon accusing me of the same thing.</p>
<p>I am glad you apologized but I am not sure how sincere it is after reading the rest of your post.  It is as if you are trying to justify what you did.  Please be more careful next time. Falsely accusing someone of such a serious topic is no small matter. </p>
<p>You also revealed yourself as a Southern European supremacist. I am waiting for others to give YOU the same treatment I have been given over stuff I never even said. </p>
<p>I guess wasps are allowed to take the heat when their ethnicity is ridiculed while everyone else is allowed to say what they wish.</p>
<p>I am also waiting for you to debate the other guy who&rsquo;s quotes you attributed to me; or does everyone on here enjoy beating up on female posters because that is the easy thing to do?</p>
<p>You also insulted me a few times in your post with statements mocking my Christianity. At this point, I just don&rsquo;t know if I can ever respect anything else you have to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I was trying to say is that it&rsquo;s important, extremely important, for us of European descent to be united regardless of where in Europe we originated from and whether of not some of us are the genetic product of hundreds of years of conquests which invariably have injected in some of us a non-caucasian DNA or profess a modified,reinterpreted Christian faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that you falsely accused me of saying the opposite of everything you say in this paragraph, what you say here is irrelevant.  Why do you even think you have room to lecture me further when you were already wrong to accuse me in the first place?</p>
<p>Wanting to seek out a marriage partner who is genetically similar to me hardly means I hate other whites or that I ever said that Southern Europeans have nonwhite blood in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing is that we all consider ourselves Europeans and uphold the greatness of the European civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why? You just got done explaining to all of us how Southern Europeans are superior to Northern Europeans.</p>
<p>&#8220;With these premises I favor calling ourselves either Euro-Americans or European Americans. Peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that the person I choose to marry or that which I wish to refer to myself as has very little to do with what needs to be done for the future of our race.</p>

<p>Is Amren turning into Big Brother now, dictating who we can and can&rsquo;t marry?</p>
<p>How does any of this mean that either you or I don&rsquo;t care about our race as a whole?  When have I ever been critical of Colombus or the Greeks and Romans?  How absurd.</p>
<p>I guess since we are of Northwest European descent, this is the price we pay. Other ethnicities are allowed to ridicule us but we aren&rsquo;t allowed to do the same to them.  Who is being divisive?</p>

		<p>Courtney, you have the right to marry the man you think is more compatible to you. Obviously, in the search for such a person you will consider what more that person has in common with you.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t see anything offensive here or for me to be against to.<br/>
I still believe that all those whose origin is in Europe,regardless of religion or other traits should identify themselves as Euro or European Americans here in this Country. As related to my original answer about a quote attributed to you I have already apologized if you found it objectionable and personal and as civilized people we should move on. I wish you well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty standard on Amren. Every now and again someone will mention the significance they place on their regional/ethnic heritage, or certain secondary racial characteristics (i.e. eyes, hair, height, etc.) that they admire, and then this will enrage the die-hard, fundamentalist pan-European Whiteness advocates who demand that we all renounce our unique bloodlines in order to coordinate against the rising tide of non-Whites. </p>
<p>To be fair, I think some of these types are well-intentioned, and are just seriously concerned with the undeniable issues confronting those of European ancestry. But, they don&rsquo;t seem to understand that it&rsquo;s a big jump in logic to insist that this can ONLY be achieved by promoting widespread intermixture. </p>
<p>After all, supposedly the macro &#8216;White&rsquo; category comprises roughly 8-10% of the world&rsquo;s population. This is actually quite a lot when you consider how much larger the world population is today compared with just 100 years ago (back when the share for Whites was something like 30-33%). But this figure masks the problems specifically facing Northwest European Caucasoids, who are only a very small proportion of the White category. We represent something like 1-2% of the global population. Now THAT is a small figure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not our fault that we CREATED the USA out of nothing and then transformed it into something respectable in a very short time. Of course I &#8216;identify&rsquo; with &#8216;Western Civilization&rsquo; in a broad sense, but this civilization is clearly made up of diverse groups, each of whom are unique and should be encouraged to preserve (and advance) their identities&hellip;</p>
<p>Also, just as a side remark, Courtney&rsquo;s posts have raised a very important issue: it is NEVER okay to bash/insult our females; I&rsquo;m not making specific accusations, but since she clearly felt that way I think it should be pointed out. Our women deserve much, MUCH better than that! </p>

		<p>Allisio Rex,</p>
<p>I am a decent Christian person and normally I am quick to let things go when someone apologizes.  I am also NOT the type of person who will &#8220;do to others as they do to me&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since you have apologized, I am not going to give you a hard time anymore.  And the other thing is that I don&rsquo;t know what good it will do to continue the discussion anyhow. I am sure you mean well, and that it is perhaps my fault for misunderstanding your intentions.</p>
<p>Now in defense of myself one last time, I was harassed on here for a few days straight due to people irresponsibly miscontruing innocent points I was making. And it was all in relation to a very sensitive topic dealing with white solidarity as well as pride in who you are.  I don&rsquo;t EVER want anybody on here to think I am a Nordic supremacist.  That is one of the last things I want to be labeled as.</p>
<p>And then what you did was the tip of the iceburg. It just didn&rsquo;t seem to me before, after reading your first apology, like you really understood exactly why I was upset with you and the extent of what you did which was no small matter when it comes to polite debate on Amren; especially when you weren&rsquo;t willing to go back and read the discussion again. And even in the post you just wrote it seems you are still implying that it is all in my head and there was no reason for me to be upset with what you did. Look at your last couple of sentences inparticular.</p>
<p>In any case, I am dropping it, and I am going to put the blame on myself for perhaps misinterpretting your intentions here. We all know talking through writing on a computer is a horrible way to communicate anyhow.  I also understand that men have different ways of going about these things in writing than women do, which, by the way, is not meant to be an insult to either gender. </p>
<p>I appreciate your apology, and I won&rsquo;t bring this up ever again, unless someone else wishes to discuss it or unless it ever happens again.</p>
<p>I wish you well as well. And I am glad you have such strong convictions about your race.  And in closing, I am not necessarily against all of us calling ourselves European Americans either. That topic was probably one of the more minor elements of my argument anyways. </p>

The positive side is at the end, there did seem to be a meeting of minds and creeds on the post .                                                                         Natural ability is a wonderful gift . But in my layman&rsquo;s opinion it&rsquo;s very hard to beat the desire to or the need to and the belief that you can . Despite the Asian&rsquo;s greater cranial volume almost all of Asia had to be yanked out of a Medieval existence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the West . China&rsquo;s ancient fleets never left home waters because they feared what might lay over the next horizon . It was European vessels and courage that made the world smaller. The Asians missed their chance but it was their choice .                                                                      Looking  at WW2 Imperial Japan and the rousing giant dragon of China today, you would think there would be a message in there somewhere to not educate your potential enemies .                                                                    Even the sub-Saharan African has the propensity for genius . The bandwidth may be much narrower, never the less it is still there . It was dark complected Berbers who kept their boot heels planted squarely in the backs of the Spanish for something like 700 years . Lap dogs for their Arab/Muslim masters in my opinion but they still got the job done . But that&rsquo;s little consolation for the poor Spanish . Never under estimate your competition, even if they do have smaller craniums and a poor track record to boot .    </p>

		<p>This is #15. I was the one who initially quoted Courtney and Anonoment. I apologize if my participation in anyway led to this shouting match among the various posters. That was never my intention. I regret if this is the case. </p>
<p>I have come to realize that sometimes in life certain things are left best UNSAID (pointing fingers at moir)&hellip;</p>
