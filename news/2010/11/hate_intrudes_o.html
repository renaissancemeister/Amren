<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=232421">Hate Intrudes on Thanksgiving</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Fitzpatrick, WorldNetDaily, November 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center has placed a virtual who&rsquo;s who of pro-family and Christian organizations, including the Family Research Council, the American Family Association and the Traditional Values Coalition, on a list of 13 &#8220;hate groups&#8221; for opposing the homosexual political agenda.</p>
<p>In its freshly released Winter 2010 Intelligence Report, SPLC labels five additional groups as &#8220;anti-gay,&#8221; including Concerned Women for America, the Christian Anti-Defamation Coalition, and Coral Ridge Ministries.</p>
<p>No authentic &#8220;hate&#8221; groups, by any conventional definition, are listed in SPLC&rsquo;s article, &#8220;18 Anti-Gay Groups and Their Propaganda.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No organization better defines what a hate group is all about than the Southern Poverty Law Center,&#8221; said Robert Knight, Washington correspondent for Coral Ridge Ministries. &#8220;Smearing legitimate groups merely for disagreeing about homosexuality is a very hateful act.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This underscores why many of us opposed passage of the federal hate-crimes bill, which lays the groundwork for making Christian morality into a form of hate punishable under the law,&#8221; Knight continued. &#8220;The SPLC has included several groups in the past that did not belong on a legitimate list, such as Family Research Institute, Mission America, and Americans for Truth about Homosexuality, and now they&rsquo;ve widened their smear to include even more Christian organizations that defend traditional morality in the public square.&#8221;</p>
<p>SPLC officials were not available to comment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Left&rsquo;s smear campaigns of conservatives is being driven by the clear evidence that the American public is losing patience with their radical policy agenda as seen in the recent election and in the fact that every state, currently more than thirty, that has had the opportunity to defend the natural definition of marriage has done so,&#8221; said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to form a coalition of organizations to lobby Congress to withhold funds from SPLC,&#8221; Christian Anti-Defamation Coalition head Gary L. Cass told WND. &#8220;We will also demand Congress restrict federal law enforcement from relying on the biased SPLC reports, like the discredited &#8216;Report on Right-Wing Extremism&rsquo; SPLC wrote for the Department of Homeland Security.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s disturbing that the U.S. Department of Justice takes its cue from Morris Dees&rsquo; SPLC as to which groups fit the &#8216;hate&rsquo; criteria. I wonder how many Americans would be comfortable with seeing their tax dollars go toward supporting a hate group like the SPLC,&#8221; Knight added.</p>
<p>Wendy Wright, president of Concerned Women for America, contended that SPLC is more focused on advancing a radical political agenda than on combating hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be an opportunity to point out who are actually filled with hate and bigotry,&#8221; said Wright. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the homosexual groups that have violated and invaded churches, vandalized homes and cars, that instigate death threats against people who are simply trying to uphold traditional values,&#8221; Wright observed.</p>

						<p>
							<i>J. Matt Barber, Washington Times, November 26, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Prior to November&rsquo;s secular-socialism rollback, America&rsquo;s ever-shrill &#8220;progressive&#8221; machine contorted in a desperate effort to paint the Tea Party movement as a horde of hateful, inbred racists. Judging by the results, it was an epic failure.</p>
<p>Instead, and thanks at least in part to the left&rsquo;s overreaching smear campaign, the grass-roots Tea Party groundswell  &mdash;  representing every facet of traditional American values  &mdash;  grew to become a political force of nature.</p>
<p>Now the frays of the fanatical fringe have done it again. These so-called &#8220;progressives,&#8221; led by the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center SPLC, have gifted the American mainstream with yet another teachable moment. The SPLC is a small, hard-left political activist outfit known for promoting a panoply of radical liberal causes. The center holds itself out as an objective monitor of potentially violent or subversive hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, skinheads and other white supremacists.</p>
<p>But in recent years  &mdash;  and with increasing abandon  &mdash;  the SPLC has leveraged (abused, really) its rapidly decreasing political capital and waning credibility to target and undermine organizations that, rather than dealing in the business of genuine &#8220;hate,&#8221; instead pose a direct threat to the advancement of postmodern secular-socialism generally  &mdash;  and to the Democratic Party specifically. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Following to the letter Saul Alinsky&rsquo;s admonition to &#8220;pick the target, freeze it, personalize it and polarize it,&#8221; the SPLC, in its most recent Intelligence Report, has &#8220;officially&#8221; labeled a number of highly influential mainstream conservative and Christian organizations as &#8220;hate groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most notably, the SPLC has placed alongside the Klan and other neo-Nazi organizations, the Washington, D.C., based Family Research Council (FRC) and the Mississippi-based American Family Association (AFA). Their crime? &#8220;Anti-gay .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. propagation of known falsehoods&#8221; (read: recognition of stubborn, politically incorrect scientific and theological facts that are beyond serious debate). I say &#8220;most notably&#8221; because these two groups alone contain membership rolls in the millions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the FRC and AFA play host to presidential candidates, lawmakers and top conservative leaders from around the world at Washington&rsquo;s annual Values Voters Summit  &mdash;  one of the largest conservative political gatherings of the year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So, center-right America: If you happen to believe in the sanctity of natural marriage and that, as a culture, we&rsquo;re best served by honoring the Judeo-Christian sexual ethic of our forefathers, you&rsquo;re now an official &#8220;hater.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the tired goal of this silly meme is to associate in the public mind&rsquo;s eye mainstream conservative social values with racism, white supremacy and neo-Nazism. The ironic result, however, is that, as typically occurs with such ad hominem and hyperbolic attacks, the attacker ends up marginalizing himself and galvanizing his intended target (I&rsquo;m rubber, you&rsquo;re glue and all that).</p>

		<p>This is terrific - the broader Leftwing &#8220;ant-racist&#8221; movement continues to overplay its hand at every turn, and the backlash is growing. This idea that everyone who doesn&rsquo;t toe the Left&rsquo;s &#8220;right-thinking&#8221; line across the board, is some kind of dangerous &#8220;hate-monger&#8221; has run its course. Even the mainstream, at least in many quarters, now appears wise to this game.  </p>

		<p>There should be an increased physical presence at the SPLC headquarters, complete with active protesting and constant vigilance as to who attends the &#8220;palace of hate&#8221; and a family tree researched of where their funding comes from, who is on their payroll, and just exactly what they are doing with our military and police organizations.  Their location in Ala alone should be an area where we can find those that would help.  No violence or law breaking is needed on our part.  Many good le officers and those in the mil services will be our eyes and ears of what this treasonous organization is up to.</p>

		<p>A broken clock is right twice a day, and I agree with the SPLC on this one. It&rsquo;s our tradition of tolerance and liberality in the west and among white people to support gay rights and gay relationships. Heterosexism is rampant among black Americans and non-Westerners in general. How many African or Islamic countries have same-sex marriage? If you oppose equal rights for gay people why not give up support for white causes and throw your weight in behind the gangster rappers and ayatollahs?</p>

All Christian only organisations. Now why am I not suprised. And the SPLC offers no comment. <br>

		<p>They are also sniffing out all those evil racist whites who hate Thanksgiving holiday since afterall this is the original pc multicultural misgenation day set aside for the celebration of how the races came together and broke bread for future remixation. <br>
Evenso there are pc misegenationists who swear the original US anglican colony in the new world at Roanoke Island in what is now the outer banks of NC in 1685 that became the Lost Colony was because the colonists mixed with the Croatans or even voluntarily left and thats why they saw indians with blue eyes. </p>
<p>Hopefully all the liberals who celebrated Thanksgiving enjoyed their turkey to symbolize the brotherhood of the return to the new old world order mulatto single human race currently in progress.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;d think that even the far-left press would see a problem in labeling Christian, traditional-values groups as haters.  Yet the party line must have adherence, even in the face of dangers to liberty and the nation&rsquo;s security.  The Army private who downloaded classified info is a homosexual with personal problems that may have driven him to seek revenge against the system, yet I&rsquo;m yet to hear this fact stated on TV.  Even with the DADT controversy in full gear, no TV commentator dares to mention this pertinent fact.</p>

<p>No, you are not obsessing over it. I feel the same way and that black &#8220;professor&#8221; who said on C-span (in plain view) he wanted ALL Whites on the planet murdered.  Whites seem to take it all with a grain of salt and do not realize these people MEAN IT! This is the problem with Whites, they don&rsquo;t take the genocide of their own race as real or else they are too cowardly to confront the race war against us. </p>

		<p>To Peter:<br>
Supposing that it is true that homosexuality is a White or mostly White phenomenon, it does not follow that to oppose it is anti-White. To illustrate the point, consider such ideas as tolerance, diversity, human rights, hate crimes, affirmative action, liberalism, etc. These are all thoroughly White ideas and you will find none of them in African or Islamic countries. Yet, as readers of this site well know, to champion them is to champion the oppression and eventual extinction of the White race. It is manifestly possible, hence, for a White-loving White to reject specifically White ideas and lifestyles.</p>

<p>They (SPLC) have an AGENDA and they know exactly what those people are. Their agenda is to destroy the White race and in doing so, destroy America. They HATE White people (especially White Christians) just like the ADL and their other alphabet orgs. do. Problem is, most White Christians, haven&rsquo;t a clue about their own demise and more than likely support these organizations.</p>
