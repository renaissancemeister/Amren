			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Reilly, ESPN, Nov. 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This week, John Feinstein, the Washington Post columnist, said something that reminds me of a kidney stone I once had. I just couldn&rsquo;t let it pass without some gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>Feinstein went on the Post&rsquo;s video blog and essentially called Washington Redskins coach Mike Shanahan a racist for benching Donovan McNabb in the Redskins&rsquo; loss to Detroit in their most recent game.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&rsquo;s racial coding going on here, and it&rsquo;s my belief that that kind of behavior is worth firing a coach for,&#8221; Feinstein claimed Tuesday. &#8220;Dan Snyder&rsquo;s not gonna do it, but I think it&rsquo;s out of control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just to recap, Feinstein wants a two-time Super Bowl-winning coach fired after half a season because he pulled McNabb with less than two minutes to go in favor of a white backup, Rex Grossman. Shanahan said McNabb wasn&rsquo;t as familiar with the team&rsquo;s two-minute offense as the backup.</p>
<p>Enter Feinstein.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first spin [Shanahan uses] is that [McNabb] doesn&rsquo;t know the terminology for the two-minute offense, i.e., he&rsquo;s stupid,&#8221; Feinstein opined. &#8220;The next day, it&rsquo;s, well, his cardiovascular, he&rsquo;s out of shape, i.e., he&rsquo;s fat.&#8221; And that&rsquo;s when Feinstein dropped the &#8220;racial coding&#8221; thing, i.e., Shanahan&rsquo;s a racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The head throbs. Are we really going there? In 2010?</p>
<p>First of all, so what? Maybe McNabb isn&rsquo;t as familiar with Shanahan&rsquo;s two-minute offense as Grossman was. After all, Shanahan&rsquo;s playbook is thicker than the Oxford English Dictionary. And McNabb hasn&rsquo;t had to learn a new NFL offense since he was a rookie. He didn&rsquo;t know the overtime rule last year. Was it racist to call him on it?</p>
<p>Second of all, so what? Maybe McNabb is out of shape. Anybody remember reports of McNabb dawdling to the line during the crucial minutes of Philadelphia&rsquo;s Super Bowl loss to the Patriots? Remember reports of him throwing up in the huddle?</p>
<p>What is Feinstein saying? That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not possible Grossman knew the two-minute offense better? That it&rsquo;s not possible for a white guy to be better at something than a black guy? That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not possible for a black guy to be out of shape? If that&rsquo;s the logic, what follows is: Black people are never inept. Apparently, according to Feinstein, white people have cornered the market on it. And if you think a black person is inept occasionally  &mdash;  like McNabb  &mdash;  go stand in the racist line.</p>
<p>Benching McNabb was a boneheaded mistake, of course. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how little McNabb knew the two-minute offense, doesn&rsquo;t matter how out of shape he was; I&rsquo;d rather have McNabb on one leg dragging an IV than Grossman. So Shanahan didn&rsquo;t want to cop to his mistake. Doesn&rsquo;t make him a racist. Makes him the George S. Patton I&rsquo;ve always known him to be.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it Shanahan who wanted McNabb in the first place? Convinced Dan Snyder to trade for him? Wasn&rsquo;t McNabb black then? Or was there something wrong with the racial coding on Shanahan&rsquo;s flat-screen?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If Donovan McNabb can&rsquo;t do something well, or screws up, or fails, can&rsquo;t it just be &#8220;Donovan McNabb screwed up?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if Mike Shanahan makes a dumb coaching move and is too stubborn to cop to it in front of the world, can&rsquo;t it just be &#8220;Mike Shanahan blew it?&#8221; </p>
<p>Why must it be about race? Like that kidney stone, didn&rsquo;t we pass this years ago? <br>

<p>This is precisely the message the media sends.  <i>Precisely</i>.  And believe it or not (shock!), the yakkers and scribblers pick up on it, and know the game to play if they want to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>Reilly&rsquo;s now on the watch list.</p>

		<p>Well, this Rick Reilly has taken at least half a step toward the light.  He&rsquo;s realized that it&rsquo;s okay to call a black incompetent, but only if you&rsquo;re not thinking Evil Racist Thoughts while you do it.  Sort of a &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; theory applied to football.</p>
<p>When he finally understands that it&rsquo;s okay to be a <i>genuine</i> racist, <i>then</i> his true revelation will begin.<br>

		<p>Someone once said &#8220;there&rsquo;s nothing worse than a sports lib&#8221;, and it&rsquo;s true.  Many of these sports journalists are black athlete worshipers of the highest degree.  They see black athletes as infallible and above any white athletes.  They see the world of sport like this because most are failed athletes themselves.</p>

		<p>ESPN is a liberal sports channel and for the most part they push black athletes in a positive light 99% of the time. I NEVER listen or watch ESPN any longer. castefootball.us  is what every White man needs to read.</p>

 Can Reilly keep his job at Sports Illustrated after this?<br>
I quit subscribing years ago - its much more about left-liberal<br>
politics than it is about sports.</p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s hope that Reilly doesn&rsquo;t join the ranks of<br>
Al Campanis, Jimmy the Greek, John Rocker, Don Imus<br>
and others.</p>

		<p>My My, how the tone is changing in the national public forum on race&hellip;All it took was for someone to go first, then the lid blew off&hellip;It seems as though the gatekeepers of political correctness are feverishly playing Whack-A-Mole in trying to silence the ever-growing number of outspoken White men and women&hellip;It sure feels good to finally see them flying into hysterics as their house of cards slowly crumbles&hellip;</p>

		<p>As always with Mcnabb, there&rsquo;s a sanctimonious jock sniffer in the media coming to his rescue. As a former Philly fan, I&rsquo;ll trust the judgment of a 2 time Superbowl winning coach over that of the NFL&rsquo;s sacred cow that went 1 for 4 in NFC championship games and couldn&rsquo;t manage the clock during a drive that any elite QB could have scored on.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget:</p>

<p>Uh, &#8220;racial coding&#8221;? What is that? </p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t tell me, I don&rsquo;t want to know. Are we now going to have 50 different terms for different varieties of &#8220;racism&#8221; (like eskimos have for different kinds of ice)?</p>
<p>Spare me.</p>
<p>Speaking of black athletes, this one wears diamond earrings while playing football. He lost one on the field recently, but it was found: &#8220;Bryant said he gave the security guard a &#8216;big thank you.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Mcnabb is truly one of the most overrated QBs of the last 20 years.  Among the NFL elite QBs, Mcnabb being one of them I suppose, what has he accomplished compared to the Mannings, Farve, Brees, etc?  No has really dared asking this question because he is protected, plain and simple.</p>

		<p>Never say anything negative about McNabb, just ask Rush Limbo.</p>
<p>This negates everything John Feinstein ever said, his books are now fireplace starters.  Is it possible for any of these black wunderkinds to stand on their own without some whiney white lib promoting them to star status?</p>

		<p>McNabb scored the lowest of all starting QBs on the Wonderlic exam, used by NFL to evaluate players&rsquo; intelligence.  Actually, he&rsquo;s tied for last with 2 other black QBs with 14.</p>

<p>Is that really a surprise?  I&rsquo;ve tried posting comments on some of ESPN.com&rsquo;s more, shall we say, colorful news stories.  If anyone tries to post something that remotely resembles &#8220;raciss behavior&#8221;, that quote is promptly removed and you will be banned from posting on the site for a day or two.</p>
<p>But then again, what do you expect from the uber-Liberal folks up in Bristol, CT who slobber over Black athletic performance? <br>

<p>Maybe the &#8220;racial coding&#8221; is being done by Feinstein.  It&rsquo;s my belief that that kind of behavior is worth firing a columnist for.</p>
<p>In case you don&rsquo;t know, John Feinstein is one of the most prolific authors of books about sports, ever.  He&rsquo;s a regular guest on sports radio to hawk his books.  Also he&rsquo;s on NPR a lot.  I&rsquo;ve listened to this guy countless times over many years.  Well-spoken &amp; knowledgeable.  Apparently he&rsquo;s also a PC leftist.</p>
<p>McNabb has used the &#8220;race card&#8221; numerous times; maybe he put a bug in John&rsquo;s ear?</p>
<p>The notion that a &#8220;racist&#8221; could survive as an NFL head coach in this super-PC time is absurd.  Coach Mike Shanahan is not some unknown jackass; he&rsquo;s a coaching legend.</p>
<p>I saw several former NFL&rsquo;ers on a panel on ESPN after the infamous benching.  All (white &amp; black) thought that Shanahan did this to get a message across to his new diva-esque QB that hard work was expected from him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to see the Titans v. Redskins game this week.  Very curious about it all.  I&rsquo;ll bring binoculars (as usual), so I can study the faces of McNabb &amp; Shanahan.</p>
