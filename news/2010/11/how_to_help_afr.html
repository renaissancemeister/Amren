<h1><a href="https://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/achievement-gap/how-to-help-african-american-m.html">How to Help African-American Males in School: Treat Them Like Gifted Students</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yvette Jackson, Washington Post, November 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} African-American boys drop out at nearly twice the rate of white boys; their SAT scores are on average 104 points lower; and black men represented just 5 percent of college students in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Driven by the intense focus on accountability, schools and teachers used standardized test scores to help identify and address student weaknesses. Over time, these deficits began to define far too many students so that all we saw were their deficits  &mdash;  particularly for African-American males. As a result, we began losing sight of these young boys&rsquo; gifts and, as a consequence, stifled their talents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Damaging and pervasive chasms grow between teachers and students when teachers feel unprepared to meet the needs of students of color or economically disadvantaged students. Making cultural connections and strengthening teacher-student relationships are critical to making learning meaningful and relevant to students.</p>
<p>Finally, students must be enabled to be more active in their own education. Schools should give students opportunities to participate in teachers&rsquo; professional development aimed at enriching curriculum, improving teaching and expanding the range of materials students create.</p>
<p>{snip} We must embrace a new approach to African-American males that focuses less on what they aren&rsquo;t doing and builds on what they can and want to do as the path to improving their academic performance.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We must embrace a new approach&#8221;  Exhale,Sigh,stub out cigarette&hellip;<br>
This&hellip; this acheivement gap reminds me of a scene a lifetime ago, during the end of the Vietnam war when NVA tanks were racing down Highway 1 toward Saigon. Our leaders were determining a course of action to turn things around. The consensus was to renew  limited B-52 airstrikes against the North.<br>
 One Congresswoman had seen enough and spoke out. &#8220;What will a squadron of 12  B-52`s accomplish in three to five days that a half a million troops, trillions upon trillions  of dollars and battleship after battleship for the last fifteeen years couldn`t?!?&#8221;  I sat there and realized she was right. And not only that, she was the only one who had the sense to not only cut our losses but the courage to vocalize the absurdity of continuing to try.<br>
  Thirty years later a casual friend gave me the same clear thinking to a more personal problem. I had been running a tile factory for a dozen years with barely no profit, loads of heartache and the health hazards of nurmerous  inhaled carcinogens thrown in. But I was too proud to quit, like many folks you see losing everything to chase a dream. He told me, &#8220;Jus` cause you`ve done something for twelve years doesn`t mean you have to do it for thirteen&hellip;&#8221; <br>
 I went home and realized HE was right. Folded up the shop, started banking the rent and utlity money was was breathing clear again for the first time in years. So my question is, &#8220;What will this NEW approach accomplish what fifty years and trillions of dollars couldn`t?!?&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>Driven by the intense focus on accountability&hellip;[!]</i><p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the last thing black youngsters need: accountability.  It&rsquo;ll teach them how to use their real skills instead of vaunting imagined ones, how to fulfill obligations instead of concocting demands, how to appreciate the confines of their nature rather than resenting them as unjustly imposed.  In short, it will prepare them for productive lives as respected members of the community, rather than lives full of tumult as criminals and layabouts ending in a early grave. Another example of liberal &#8220;good intentions&#8221; leading to hell for others. </p></p>

		<p><i>Schools should give students opportunities to participate in teachers&rsquo; professional development aimed at enriching curriculum&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Bon could tell us a thing or three about that.  If you want to make students smarter, you should keep them as far away from this sort of &#8220;professional development&#8221; as possible.</p>
<p><i>We must embrace a new approach to African-American males that focuses less on what they aren&rsquo;t doing and builds on what they can and want to do as the path to improving their academic performance.</i></p>
<p>The point of formal education is to force students into doing things they don&rsquo;t want to do, making them learn things they don&rsquo;t want to learn, so that they&rsquo;re better in the subject areas that are their main interest.  (Personal example   &mdash;   I was mediocre in English, language and literature through most of my school days.  A couple of great teachers in high school, then eventually hooking up with Sam Francis, changed that.  Had the education system let me ditch the subject areas of least interest to me, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here on AR being such an obnoxious know-it-all today.) As for young black men, if we let most of them do what they &#8220;want to do,&#8221; then no learning would be taking place, just goofing off, fighting, playing video games and making out with girls.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the ultimate point of this article.  If we must call black idiocy &#8220;genius&#8221; just so black men can have diplomas and high SAT scores, then why not just give them the diplomas and high SAT scores like we&rsquo;re turning them into geniuses by linguistic fiat?  I have said before, give every black man and woman a high school diploma on his or her 17th or 18th birthday (just in case s/he hasn&rsquo;t actually earned one), a Bachelor&rsquo;s at 22, a Master&rsquo;s at 25 and a Ph.D. at 28.  That way, they&rsquo;ll all be well educated, and all the social problems that are said to be a direct result of poor education will suddenly disappear.  Don&rsquo;t you feel it, too?</p>

		<p>Solution for low IQ&rsquo;s in blacks is to ask them (students) what they want to learn while in school?  Prior to civil rights, blacks were better off economically/academically because they were expected to perform at a certain standard not the reverse.  Unfortunately for the blacks, this pandering will come to an end when the Hispanics become the majority in this country.  The Hispanics will not be held hostage nor tolerate to racial shakedowns/nonsense.</p>

		<p>That is what schools used to do before liberals took over. Black (as well as non-black) guys with I.Q&rsquo;s between 80 and 100 and good attitudes were given vocational oriented schooling after they passed the 9th grade. They were taught skills that they were &#8220;gifted&#8221; in, such as: carpentry, electrical work, landscaping, etc. At that time blacks did not have to compete with immigrants for jobs, so there was no shortage of job opportunities for them. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Over time, these deficits began to define far too many students so that all we saw were their deficits &mdash; particularly for African-American males. As a result, we began losing sight of these young boys&rsquo; gifts and, as a consequence, stifled their talents.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called the truth. Whoever was directing these programs obviously saw no gifts in these &#8220;student&#8221; who wander the halls of the high schools every period and who loiter in the entryways to stairs thereby making it impossible for other students to get to class on time. The same &#8220;students&#8221; who disrupt classes every day with their clownish behavior and spend most of the time chatting up the girls, usually white. They see other students e.g Most Whites and Asians achieving in school by paying attention in class, and yet after all these years they haven&rsquo;t figured it out. <br>
I adopted an eight month old male puppy of German Shepherd and Doberman mix who squatted when he peed. One day my neighbors had visitors who brought their full bred Doberman with them. Both the Dobie and our dog who at that point was well over 80 pounds and still squatting,  played and rough-housed most of the afternoon. At one point I noticed that whenever the Doberman stopped to pee he would lift his leg. I noticed that when he did our dog would stop and watch him with the typical head cocked to one side pose. The next day when I let our dog out to pee, he immediately lifted his leg and peed like a real boy dog.<br>
After all these years the Black males haven&rsquo;t yet learned that success is achieved not by blaming the Legacy of Slavery, Jim Crow, Institutional Racism, Crackers (and their little babies), but rather by making a simple conclusion that what their successful classmates are doing is what THEY should be doing. Instead they continue on the path that is destructive not only to them but to everyone else who is unfortunate enough to come in contact with them. Those kids who go to school with them are also hurt by the dumbing down of the curriculum and the classroom disruption that takes up so much of a teacher&rsquo;s &#8220;teaching time&#8221;. <br>
As a teacher of over 4 decades, I&rsquo;m disgusted with the &#8221; blame the teachers&#8221; mentality that has taken over here. Let&rsquo;s instead focus on the irresponsible Black males whose all consuming interest is &#8220;bonin&#8221; by whatever means necessary including violent rape, the profligate females who enable them and of a culture where it&rsquo;s commonplace for a grandmother to be in her mid thirties. <br>
And lastly and sadly, we have to acknowledge the number of Hispanics who go down the same path in school and in their personal lives with so many pregnancies in their teen years and again no fathers. Many Hispanic girls clain to be &#8221; acompañadas&#8221; by the baby daddy for at least the first three months of the baby&rsquo;s life and after that, all to often it&rsquo;s Adios. Nos vemos.</p>

They have been totally convinced that their mastery of the first third of the alphabet, entitles them to live like a white man. It&rsquo;s the fault of racist whitey!

		<p>&#8220;How to Help African-American Males in School: Treat Them Like Gifted Students&#8221;</p>
<p>God, that&rsquo;s funny.  Absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>Will these moronic blacks EVER just face the truth and quit trying to fit a square peg in a round hole by coming up with ridiculous reasons why black males just can&rsquo;t succeed, as if their lack of intelligence doesn&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>Black males with average I.Q&rsquo;s of around 80 are not going to succeed no matter what is tried to help them.  Allowing them to enter certain professions after GIVING them entry into schools, grades they never earned and certification even though they can barely read and write, does no more than put the public at greater risk if they have to deal with them.</p>
<p>I imagine the above Yvette Jackson thinks she got a job at the Washington Post because she&rsquo;s competent, instead of a black PC  token.<br>

		<p> If we simply brought back segregation the black students would be competeing against other blacks and thus would have a good chance of being valedictorian. If we did away with affirmative action it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for the parents to relise that they had better get the kids to buckle down and excell as there wouldn&rsquo;t be the free goverment job for them.</p>

<p>One of the few true parts of this article. Without dedication, no one will ever succeed. Improvement ton the culture that exisst in African American homes is a good starting point. Many black parents need to start thinking of their choldren rather than themselves if they want a better future for them.</p>

		<p>So&hellip;&hellip;public government schools have gone from a curriculum designed to either prepare students for college, or prepare them for responsible jobs, based on merit - have now become institutions designed to make minorities feel good about themselves, invite students to tell the SCHOOLS what courses they want based on what THEY feel they can pass, all so blacks might deign to attend and graduate.  It&rsquo;s no longer an emphasis on how to become a useful citizen, but just obtaining a piece of paper saying you graduated something - anything - however useless.  All because blacks were forced on whites in the classroom.  Segregation, by whatever means necessary, is the only remedy to restore a civil, educated, responsible society in America.  There is NOTHING we can do to raise up the black man.  Nothing.  He is neither willing, nor capable, of being raised up.  </p>

holder of the office since Warren Harding. He has made many major mistakes - his recent Far East trip is merely the latest in the litany.</p>
<p>Yet so many keep praising him, as so many others have over the years, telling him he&rsquo;s so smart, so great, that he&rsquo;s such a great thinker, that he&rsquo;s a genius, and so forth. And he has come to believe all of this, that he is a far greater man than he could ever possibly be. As he leads us further down the road to perdition. </p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s keep doing this, and extend it to ALL black men.<br>

		<p>So, here&rsquo;s another brilliant idea from the billion dollar industry known as the &#8220;Let&rsquo;s Try Again To Teach African-Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>All you need to do is look at the author of this poppycock to see from where its flawed origins arise.</p>
<p>I sense the industry is running out of ideas designed to waste our tax money. A moron can figure out that the answer to chronically low performing students is not to suddenly place them in gifted classes. Why? Well, let&rsquo;s face it - they&rsquo;re not gifted. That&rsquo;s almost like saying, let&rsquo;s take the smartest children and put them in classes designed for idiots and see what happens.</p>
<p>I suspect a hidden agenda is for black organizations and liberals to be able to one day point to a school district and say, &#8220;But look - four out of five African-Americans are in gifted classes.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s classic black America, sadly. Don&rsquo;t change anything, just change the label. </p>

		<p>Yvette Jackson is wrong on so many points, it&rsquo;s difficult to respond to them.  First, she decries the fact so many black males have &#8216;deficits&rsquo; which need to be addressed by schools in these times of &#8216;high accountability&rsquo; that we&rsquo;re overly concerned about these and thus not able to recognize their &#8216;gifts.&rsquo;  Hogwash.  Do the deficits exist or not?  Are these not - in general - the result of dysfunctional non-existent black &#8216;families&rsquo; that abound everywhere in our society today? Have we not ample evidence that more recent immigrants - like the truly Vietnamese boat refugees and other disadvantaged groups from Asia - that America provides boundless opportunities for everyone who is willing to abide by our rules, work hard, stay out of trouble, and acquire a good education?  Do American schools not offer the widest array of sports programs, cultural arts programs and untold extra and co-curricular activities to attract, motivate and otherwise amuse today&rsquo;s students?  Are black male athletes&rsquo; &#8216;natural gifts&rsquo; not recognized enough in our high school and professional sports programs?  Have we not lowered the academic bar and bent over backwards to promote their success at the post-secondary level?  When colleges provide more quality points on the application of a black male than they award to the person who attains a perfect SAT score, something is dreadfully wrong! <br>
   Yvette blames teacher disconnect for today&rsquo;s problems and the fact that students don&rsquo;t have enough &#8216;say&rsquo; in the professional development of teachers.  Yea.  That&rsquo;s the answer.  Let&rsquo;s let our most dysfunctional children run the schools and maybe even our universities.  That should do it. <br>
   This is as about as good an idea as that coming recently out of the &#8220;Gary Commission on the Social Status of Black Males.&#8221;  That group favors - rather than emphasizing the need to hold high expectations of civil behavior and respect for the law on the part of black males - the expunging of their criminal records so that they might be better able to find a job once they complete their prison sentence!  Yea, and let&rsquo;s give them a free college education, too, while we&rsquo;re at it!  After all, now that they are in their late 20s and about to grow up, they&rsquo;re ready to study in school! <br>
   Well, I&rsquo;ve got something equally shocking for our &#8216;Miss Affirmative Action journalist&rsquo;   &mdash;   what is wrong is not that we&rsquo;re overlooking the &#8216;talent&rsquo; of black males in our society, it&rsquo;s we don&rsquo;t hold them to be responsible for much of anything anywhere   &mdash;   ANYWHERE on the globe!  It&rsquo;s the same problem in England, Scandinavia, Canada, Switzerland   &mdash;   the list goes on!  Perhaps, Miss Yvette, you&rsquo;ll come to someday realize that George Fitzhugh was right all along!  Thank goodness you&rsquo;re in the newsroom where you can&rsquo;t hurt anyone with your inane ideas instead of being a superintendent of schools.  (On the other hand, apply in Gary.  They might hire you!)<br>

		<p>What could be more frustrating to a child than insisting that he can do something he can&rsquo;t? <br>
Many black men used to perform traditional jobs like shining shoes and portering on trains.  Then liberals convinced them that such positions were demeaning  &mdash;  that all of them must attend college.  Now a large number are left to deal drugs or sponge off working or welfare-receiving mothers and girlfriends.  </p>

		<p>From my experience teaching bright students, I can identify several traits that they display:</p>
<p>1) Rarely if ever need to be disciplined<br>
2) Are self-starters<br>
3) Are honest and forthright<br>
4) Are in class solely to learn and eschew all distractions</p>
<p>Does anyone is his right mind believe that the four characteristics I listed even remotely apply to Africans, much less those who are males?</p>
<p>Just another case of an African journalist spewing untruths in pursuit of making Whitey better understand her &#8220;brothers&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Wonderful gobbletegook. Most black boys have one real talent,running. Running down the field or from the cops. Rather than draft every black kid the day he turns 16 and teach them how to kill Muslims and be on time, we waste money trying to turn low IQers into high IQers. We try to treat those with IQS around 80 like potential Rhode Scholars instead of prisoners. We think that allowing them to run amok, making babies at will, and terrorizing us is doing them a favor. I like the part about them being more active in their own educations. Does that mean beating up the pricipal as well as their weaker class mates? Put me in charge and I will raise black test scores by 50% in five years. I will only allow the educatable to take the tests, the rest will be replacing our Scots-Irish seed corn on Asian Dung Heaps and Mexicans on tomato farms. Work or army or jail no more sitting on your rear end living off your grand mother`s welfare and girl` freinds food stamps.<br>

		<p>&#8220;[Blacks&rsquo;] SAT scores are on average 104 points lower [than those of Whites].&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone takes the SAT.  Those who drop out of HS, go strait into the trades, or just decide for themselves that they aren&rsquo;t college material don&rsquo;t take the test.  So even though Blacks are less intelligent than Whites, all other things being equal, we should see a self-selection process whereby only those HS students who are sufficiently scholarly sign up for the test. This would result in roughly equal average Black and White scores, albeit, with a lower proportion of the Black population sitting for the test.</p>
<p>Instead, what this score disparity represents is a number of weakly qualified Black HS students who aspire to college (dragging down their average) out of proportion to that of Whites.  In other words, this shows that Black have a higher sense of capability, relative to their true ability, than do Whites.</p>

		<p>There is a real problem in this country and it&rsquo;s not just with black people. I remember a time when many people were just happy to have a job that would support them and their families. Just because you worked in a mill or factory there was no need to be ashamed or feel like a loser. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happened today is that if you don&rsquo;t have some sort of college degree and are not vice president of Bull Flop Inc. by the time you are 30 you are supposed to feel like a loser. </p>
<p>Many young people feel that if they don&rsquo;t make it in the academic or business world then life is over. </p>
<p>The reason the Mexicans are replacing the Blacks in the job market is because in Mexico a brick layer or carpenter is still considered a respectable job. </p>
<p>If you have an IQ of 80 then you are probably not going to be the president of General Motors but that doesn&rsquo;t mean a person can&rsquo;t earn an honest living at a respectable trade.</p>
<p>If America is ever going to put it&rsquo;s citizens back to work then we have to bring our manufacturing back home and then we have to put people back in those factories. </p>
<p>We won world war two not because we have more egg heads than any other country but because we could build ships faster than the enemy could sink them.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I Think Amren should consider Asians as Allies&#8221; <br>
This statement gives me a chance to pat some guy named Bud on the back who had commented  recently on Canada`s problems with immigration&hellip; I quote him, &#8220;The plain fact is that Canada`s White history is irrelevant to the colonizers. The don`t know Canada`s history, they don`t care and the truth is that Canada is dead as a traditional White nation anyway. And the new occupants are not the type to expend energy studying dead civilizations &hellip;&#8221; <br>
  This is why I don`t consider Asians allies. I do appreciate the fact that I can walk down the strret without fearing them. But put bluntly, Asians  in Vancouver care as much about Vimy Ridge and the commando raid on Dieppe about as much as Mexicans and Guatamalens embrace  Jim Bowie and Roy Rodgers. The million dollar questions are, Why should they?!? And what ever made us think they would?!? </p>

		<p>I just finished ready a marvelous book..&#8221;Where Blacks Rule <br>
Whites&#8221; about Haiti in 1900. The writer makes the first<br>
tour of the island after 100 years of Black Rule and is <br>
appalled at the complete collapse of the &#8220;Pearl of the Indies&#8221;<br>
into Voodoo, decay and corruption. One funny chapter is on the <br>
Haitian military where everyone has been given the rank of <br>
&#8220;General&#8221; to raise their self esteem. In an army of 12,000, 7000 are titled General. Meanwhile nothing works<br>
on the island but everyone is walking around in gold braid<br>
and flashy uniforms accomplishing nothing in reality but looking good doing it. Instead of &#8220;General&#8221; substitute &#8220;Ph.D or Dr.<br>
or Reverend, or &#8220;Educator&#8221; or Congressman and you have Black<br>

		<p>I am a former progressive, and I must say, in retrospect, it is a catastrophe that my camp won the day 50+ years ago.</p>
<p>we turned the country upside down and inside out and wasted billions of dollars in order to prove a false thesis:</p>
<p>that absent discrimination, blacks would achieve as well as whites.</p>
<p>low average cognitive ability remains the most serious obstacle facing Africans and African-Americans, and any policy which fails to acknowledge this is destructive.</p>
<p>breathtakingly few black students are gifted, many are mediocre, and most are in fact subnormal by white standards.</p>
<p>no one would dream of telling a white student with an IQ of 85 that he&rsquo;s gifted.</p>
<p>telling blacks they are gifted is just going to drives an insane, fill them with unrealistic expectations, and possibly generate enormous reservoirs of hatred and rage toward more successful people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Schools should give students opportunities to participate in teachers&rsquo; professional development aimed at enriching curriculum, improving teaching and expanding the range of materials students create.&#8221;</p>
<p>- This one had me stopped cold, and then I imagined &#8216;little&rsquo; DeQuan or &#8216;darling&rsquo; Shamika standing before us teachers, pin-drop silence, and &#8216;teaching&rsquo; us how to teach them better.</p>
<p>The young white liberals would genuflect deferentially and smile with great pride that they were being instructed by their precious little brown ones. </p>
<p>The older teachers would remember how education was until about 1990 and roll their eyes.  Then they would panic when they noticed the 25-year old black or latino or leftist female administrator glaring at them with &#8220;You are so canned, old geezer!&#8221; coming straight out of their eyeballs.</p>
<p>When results are still dismal, the same leftist teachers and administrators will cook the books, changes grades, give &#8216;credit recovery&rsquo; time, etc. and everyone will say, &#8220;The gap is closing!  Hooray!&#8221;  Until a study a few years later says it was all a fantasy, time to start over.  Roll in the billions.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see how we can help most black males.  We pour billions into their causes and communities, and they become even more violent. Our financial aid to them exponentially increases and their violent criminal behavior becomes even more horrifying and racist. They are a lost cause. The government needs to enforce zero tolerance on crime and force black men to work for their government money (and others who follow that path).</p>
<p>I remember talking with a black female high school teacher. She taught in a predominantly black school. The crime in the school was so bad that she had to be escorted to her class room by some students who befriended her. They covered her through the hallways as if she were in a war zone. (imagine if she were white??) She hated the experience so much that she left the US and moved to a whiter nation. She told me that this new country is great, but stay out of a certain region&hellip;that region is filled with people of color, it&rsquo;s just as dangerous as the U.S. I was shocked to hear this from a black woman. I won&rsquo;t write any more details, I want to protect her identity. Imagine a liberal, black, female having such an awakening? The situation will never get better. You may save a small handful, but most will only get worse. The only solution is martial law in black communities (and similar) and &#8220;workfare&#8221;. They need to become well-behaved janitors, etc or they don&rsquo;t eat. </p>

		<p>For those who is wondering who the author is (she is black as someone on this board guessed correctly), see below.  It clearly explains why our educational system is in such a mess.  This Ms. Jackson has been given numerous degrees so as to be able to get into the elite schools to influence the direction of our educational system = dumbing down to cater to low IQ blacks to make them good.  For all those degrees, Jackson&rsquo;s solution is to dress up the black kids so they all look good, never mind if they can&rsquo;t read, write, add/subtract.  This country has flipped with all its catering to blacks (morons)=craziness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Jackson currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Urban Alliance for Effective Education, founded at The College Board and Teachers College, Columbia University. She works with school district administrators and teachers across the country to customize and deliver systemic approaches to literacy development through instructional practices that integrate culture, language and cognition to expand and accelerate student learning and achievement. She is a visiting lecturer at Harvard University, a member of ASCD&rsquo;s Differentiated Instruction Cadre and a keynote presenter at national and international conferences.</p>
<p>Dr. Jackson received a BA from Queens College of the City University of New York with a double major in Education and French. At Columbia University&rsquo;s Teachers College, she was awarded an MA in Curriculum, an Ed.M. in Educational Administration, and a Doctorate in Educational Administration.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only ONE position in the PC New Amerika is allowed, sanctioned by the government, media and academia, and that is this:  All races are equally intelligent and have the same potential for achievement.  </p>
<p>All else is heresy.</p>

<p>Having students run stupid professional developments might be an improvement over what goes on now   &mdash;   and it certainly couldn&rsquo;t be any worse.</p>
<p>Student input into the educational process boil down to this:  I failed because the teacher doesn&rsquo;t like me.  The teacher is racist.  I got a low score or failed because the teacher didn&rsquo;t prepare me for the (state test, exit exam, PSAT, SAT).  The textbook is racist, I don&rsquo;t see anyone who looks like me.  The system is racist.</p>
<p>This is what the school district and the media will gleefully report.</p>
<p>Never, not ever is the student held accountable for his own failures (or shortcomings).</p>

		<p>I think the far left wants blacks to fail. These policies of ninnying and coddling low-IQed black people and telling them they can do what high-IQed white people can do ensures failure. And the failure of blacks is just what the far left wants. White people will pay any amount of money and bankrupt themselves to get away from blacks and blacks won&rsquo;t advance.</p>
