<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2108328&amp;nid=104">Blacks Struggle With 72 Percent Unwed Mothers Rate</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), November 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One recent day at Dr. Natalie Carroll&rsquo;s OB-GYN practice, located inside a low-income apartment complex tucked between a gas station and a freeway, 12 pregnant black women come for consultations. Some bring their children or their mothers. Only one brings a husband.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy-two percent of black babies are born to unmarried mothers today, according to government statistics. This number is inseparable from the work of Carroll, an obstetrician who has dedicated her 40-year career to helping black women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the issue of black unwed parenthood inches into public discourse, Carroll is among the few speaking boldly about it. And as a black woman who has brought thousands of babies into the world, who has sacrificed income to serve Houston&rsquo;s poor, Carroll is among the few whom black women will actually listen to.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Children of unmarried mothers of any race are more likely to perform poorly in school, go to prison, use drugs, be poor as adults, and have their own children out of wedlock.</p>
<p>The black community&rsquo;s 72 percent rate eclipses that of most other groups: 17 percent of Asians, 29 percent of whites, 53 percent of Hispanics and 66 percent of Native Americans were born to unwed mothers in 2008, the most recent year for which government figures are available. The rate for the overall U.S. population was 41 percent.</p>
<p>This issue entered the public consciousness in 1965, when a now famous government report by future senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan described a &#8220;tangle of pathology&#8221; among blacks that fed a 24 percent black &#8220;illegitimacy&#8221; rate. The white rate then was 4 percent.</p>
<p>Many accused Moynihan, who was white, of &#8220;blaming the victim:&#8221; of saying that black behavior, not racism, was the main cause of black problems. That dynamic persists. Most talk about the 72 percent has come from conservative circles; when influential blacks like Bill Cosby have spoken out about it, they have been all but shouted down by liberals saying that a lack of equal education and opportunity are the true root of the problem.</p>
<p>Even in black churches, &#8220;nobody talks about it,&#8221; Carroll says. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are simple arguments for why so many black women have children without marriage.</p>
<p>The legacy of segregation, the logic goes, means blacks are more likely to attend inferior schools. This creates a high proportion of blacks unprepared to compete for jobs in today&rsquo;s economy, where middle-class industrial work for unskilled laborers has largely disappeared.</p>
<p>The drug epidemic sent disproportionate numbers of black men to prison, and crushed the job opportunities for those who served their time. Women don&rsquo;t want to marry men who can&rsquo;t provide for their families, and welfare laws created a financial incentive for poor mothers to stay single.</p>
<p>If you remove these inequalities, some say, the 72 percent will decrease.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In September, Karazin [Christelyn Karazin], who is black, marshaled 100 other writers and activists for the online movement No Wedding No Womb, which she calls &#8220;a very simplified reduction of a very complicated issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The reaction was swift and ferocious. She had many supporters, but hundreds of others attacked NWNW online as shallow, anti-feminist, lacking solutions, or a conservative tool. Something else about Karazin touched a nerve: She&rsquo;s married to a white man and has a book about mixed-race relationships coming out.</p>
<p>Blogger Tracy Clayton, who posted a vicious parody of NWNW&rsquo;s theme song, said the movement focuses on the symptom instead of the cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s trying to kill a tree by pulling leaves off the limbs. And it carries a message of shame,&#8221; said Clayton, a black woman born to a single mother. &#8220;I came out fine. My brother is married with children. (NWNW) makes it seem like there&rsquo;s something immoral about you, like you&rsquo;re contributing to the ultimate downfall of the black race. My mom worked hard to raise me, so I do take it personally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Demetria Lucas, relationships editor at Essence, the magazine for black women, declined an invitation for her award-winning personal blog to endorse NWNW. Lucas, author of the forthcoming book &#8220;A Belle in Brooklyn: Advice for Living Your Single Life &amp; Enjoying Mr. Right Now,&#8221; says plenty of black women want to be married but have a hard time finding suitable black husbands.</p>
<p>Lucas says 42 percent of all black women and 70 percent of professional black women are unmarried. &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t get a husband, who am I to tell you no, you can&rsquo;t be a mom?&#8221; she asks. &#8220;A lot of women resent the idea that you&rsquo;re telling me my chances of being married are like 1 in 2, it&rsquo;s a crapshoot right now, but whether I can have a family of my own is based on whether a guy asks me to marry him or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much has been made of the lack of marriageable black men, Lucas says, which has created the message that &#8220;there&rsquo;s no real chance of me being married, but because some black men can&rsquo;t get their stuff together I got to let my whole world fall apart. That&rsquo;s what the logic is for some women.&#8221;</p>
<p>That logic rings false to Amy Wax, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, whose book &#8220;Race, Wrongs and Remedies: Group Justice in the 21st Century&#8221; argues that even though discrimination caused blacks&rsquo; present problems, only black action can cure them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks as a group will never be equal while they have this situation going on, where the vast majority of children do not have fathers in the home married to their mother, involved in their lives, investing in them, investing in the next generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Correlation between two unrelated variables does not imply that one causes they other. In other words, it&rsquo;s dishonest to say that purported inferior education quality causes black teenagers to engage in lewd, unwholesome behavior and get pregnant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legacy of segregation, the logic goes, means blacks are more likely to attend inferior schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about Muslim countries like Egypt and Yemen where poverty is rife? People from these two countries get a much lower education quality relative to black Americans, but their illegitimacy rates are negligible.</p>

There is just too much information in this one:</p>
<p><i>Carroll is among the few whom black women will actually listen to.</i></p>
<p><i>This issue entered the public consciousness in 1965, when a now famous government report by future senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan described a &ldquo;tangle of pathology&rdquo; among blacks that fed a 24 percent black &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo; rate. The white rate then was 4 percent.</i></p>

<p>Etc&hellip;</p>
<p>This is a great example of how we&rsquo;ve tried everything. Blacks can&rsquo;t get through to blacks. Whites are accused of being racists. Writers are accused of being anti-feminist. Black women who marry white men aren&rsquo;t seen as role models worth emulating.</p>
<p>If segregation was the problem, we would expect to see higher rates of illegitimate births prior to desegregation. The numbers dosn&rsquo;t seem to show that. They show the opposite. Segregation supported lower illegitimate rates.</p>

		<p>Sure single women have the right to children. No one should deny them that.</p>
<p>Just make one simple rule, if you are a single mother with a child/children and you want ANY government assistance, food stamps, welfare, anything, you get your tubes tide before assistance starts. If they have the 20k or so needed later on to get it reversed they can have more babies. If they can&rsquo;t find the money, they can just focus on raising their current &#8220;precious gifts from God&#8221; without having more.</p>

		<p>Before blacks got their &#8220;freedom&#8221; through civil rights legislation the out of wedlock births were much, much lower.  The graduation rate was much, much higher also.  There is no magic bullet to bring blacks up to whites.  It just doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

		<p>Given that black illegitimacy was much lower in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (though still higher than the white rate), it&rsquo;s rather difficult, logically, to blame it on &#8220;the legacy of segregation&#8221;. I would actually argue that the legacy of being ruled by whites was less illegitimacy, as blacks had to conform somewhat to the norms of white society. Of course, thanks to our negritude, most blacks are reverting to their natural state of affairs (polygamy and promiscuity), and are even being imitated by some whites.</p>

		<p>In the black female community, getting pregnant is a ticket to an acceptable lifestyle of having taxpayers provide their food and shelter.</p>
<p>Black women are calculating, and uninhibited by stigma.  When they get pregnant out of wedlock, it is usually planned.</p>

		<p>I live in an area with a lot of black people (planning to move soon) and I happen to be a people watcher. I think it is very strange how different black families raise girls as opposed to boys.  It is common to see an 8 year old black boy crying in a store because he can&rsquo;t have something he wants. While an 8 year old black girl is carrying an infant(sibling I hope).  The boys exhibit bad behavior from a very young age that continues to escalate without any boundaries. </p>

<p>NOT ONE of these persons EVER seems to understand why this has happened. It is all because of LBJ and the Great Society AFDC program. Give money to women with kids to bring them out of poverty AS LONG AS THERE IS NOT A MAN IN THE HOUSE!!</p>
<p>And worse is that the other groups in our society seem to emulate the Bantu in a very frightenly way. </p>
<p>&#8220;7 percent of Asians, 29 percent of whites, 53 percent of Hispanics and 66 percent of Native Americans were born to unwed mothers in 2008&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1950 the illegitimate rate among whitey was 1 %!!</p>
<p>Moynihan said that a 25 % rate was catastrophic. See what it is NOW!!</p>
<p>Every reader to this forum make proper conclusions.</p>

		<p>So now black women spread their legs for men they aren&rsquo;t married to because of white racism.  I&rsquo;m glad they explained that, because I would have found it hard to figure it out for myself.</p>
<p>Me, I&rsquo;m more worried about that 29% illegitimacy rate for whites.  It&rsquo;s now higher than the 24% black illegitimacy rate that alarmed Patrick Moynihan.  Much of the cause is the way the mass media has chosen to normalize bastardy, with pretty young actresses explaining in the tabloids and celebrity magazines why they don&rsquo;t need a man.  Feminism, of course, is fully with the program.  Note that this article itself puts the word &#8220;illegitimacy&#8221; in sneer quotes, as though to play down the seriousness of the problem.</p>
<p><i>And it carries a message of shame,&rdquo; said Clayton, a black woman born to a single mother. &ldquo;I came out fine. My brother is married with children. (NWNW) makes it seem like there&rsquo;s something immoral about you, like you&rsquo;re contributing to the ultimate downfall of the black race. My mom worked hard to raise me, so I do take it personally.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The real problem is that there isn&rsquo;t enough shame associated with bearing out of wedlock children.  One person &#8220;coming out fine&#8221; proves nothing.</p>

<p>In our society, while men sometimes still support housewives, few women seem to want to support a man. Working mothers could stand to lose custody of their children to a stay at home dad. Despite all their push for &#8216;equality&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m sure Essence magazine would claim to be at the forefront, women win custody of children in the vast majority cases. <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s getting worse, not better.</p>
<p>And with few homes having a father black whiners have the nerve to claim black &#8220;youth&#8221; are being jailed due some injustice by whitey.</p>
<p>I truly believe they&rsquo;re too stupid to understand they&rsquo;re causing degeneracy themselves, because they&rsquo;re still blaming whitey for the many pathologies that are rife within the black community.</p>
<p>The first step in solving a problem is being able to recognize there IS a problem.  They&rsquo;re just not smart enough to identify where their problems really lie.  So they just can&rsquo;t stop the deterioration they&rsquo;ve been causing to themselves.</p>

		<p> Isn&rsquo;t it interesting how, if my &#8220;legacy&#8221; is a million dollars from my parents when they pass away, and I go out and blow it, my &#8220;legacy&#8221; is gone. But the &#8220;legacy of slavery,&#8221; the &#8220;legacy of segregation,&#8221; ah, they seem to be the legacies that keep on giving forever, like a monthly earned-interest income from money in the bank.</p>
<p> See how silly these arguments made by liberals, black and White, are when put into those terms? It&rsquo;s not the &#8220;legacy of slavery,&#8221; it&rsquo;s the &#8220;legacy of the 1965 Civil Rights Act&#8221; which began the government&rsquo;s sweaty determination to look after people who wouldn&rsquo;t look after themselves   &mdash;   to, in effect, pay people to be poor.</p>
<p> In effect, the federal government and, to a lesser degree, state and local governments, have become the &#8220;daddy&#8221; to several generations of black children by making a man in the house financially unnecessary   &mdash;   and by making illegitimate children no big deal. By the debased standards of the typical black &#8220;family,&#8221; that is.</p>
<p> Seventy-two percent illegitimacy, and they talk about &#8220;victims&#8221;? How about, &#8220;people who are willfully destroying their own community&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Does anyone know the relative abortion rates for each race?  </p>
<p>It seems that the white&rsquo;s illegitacy rate has worsened at a greater pace (4% in &#8216;65 to 29% now) than the black&rsquo;s rate has.  But I think black&rsquo;s abort more &hellip; so perhaps the increase in out-of-wedlock pregnancies is somewhat equal across the board?  </p>

They cant get formally married cause the guy would get arrested. Instead he goes off and works while the mom files for free money.

<p>This is not a reason why, it&rsquo;s just a symptom of the majority of the black communitys&rsquo; larger problem. What accounts for the majority of their community acting like sociopathic narcissists? To make such bad choices? To commit the level of crime they do?I&rsquo;m sure a large part is caused from lower intelligence levels compared to other races. The other part is being raised badly by morally bankrupt parents with the emotional maturity of twelve year olds. And since we know children cannot take responsibility for their own actions and must have somebody to blame, they blame white people. Not that white people are treated better, but that no one wants to live or be around people who act like them. </p>
<p>But whatever the reasons, I just don&rsquo;t care anymore. I&rsquo;m tired of the excuses. Bad enough that blacks are the most racist people I have ever met, and I have been treated accordingly, but just as bad are the liberal, self-hating whites who believe the rhetoric being fed them. Like this article.</p>
<p>Thirty to forty years of affirmative action, section 8 and free college tuition has done little to help - things have just gotten worse, with blacks tearing this country down. We literally and figuratively cannot afford it anymore.</p>

		<p>Well cutting off all benefits to unwed mothers would do 2 things.<br>
First it would destroy the financial insentive to get pregnant thus lowering the bastard to father born children in this country. This action alone would lower the crime rate by 25% right off of the bat. </p>
<p>Second it would force these Bootymeisters to want a man who can at least help provide. Even if the guy is making minimum wage if he works 48 hours a week he can bring in $1500.00 a month. That beats nothin by a whole bunch. The problem is that she can get that much money on government subsistence, food stamps, housing and other government goodies. </p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s up at the house with her crevice creamed just waiting for her gang banger lover to come in and plop down. This has also affected whites. It is worth noting that the white illegitamcy rate is 29%. This is greater than the black rate in the 1960&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>If their survival depended upon a good man then they would want good men. This is part of the cohesion between the sexes that has become totally undermined. </p>

In 1965 Lyndon Johnson had only three more years to go. You can&rsquo;t blame everything on the Democrats.  In 1969 a Gallup poll indicated that most Americans still thought sex outside of marriage was always morally wrong.  By 1974 that had changed dramatically.  Should we blame the change on President Nixon?<br>
 <br>
One might blame the expansion of the welfare system for the increase of black illegitimacy.  White and Asian illegitimacy has also increased.  These people are much less likely to be on welfare.<br>
 <br>
The increase in illegitimacy happened because of the sexual revolution.  Now, it is true that liberals often championed the sexual revolution.  Nevertheless it did not happen because of political changes.  It happened because of changes in individual values and behavior. <br>
 <br>
The War in Vietnam contributed to the changes.  When young people rejected that war they frequently rejected the traditional morality that seemed to support it.  Also, young men going into the military to fight the war discovered that the military is not a chaste environment.  <br>
 <br>
Edmund Burke, the father of British conservatism wrote in his Letters on a Regicide Peace (1796), &#8220;War never leaves where it found a nation. It is never to be entered upon without mature deliberation.&#8221;<br>

		<p>AS been said before, the main cause of all this illegitimacy is the lack of shame associated with it. With blacks the sense of shame associated with illegitimacy (and much else) is entirely gone and hence they have the highest illegitimacy rate by far.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the zeitgeist of liberality has created a lack of shame in even the white community causing its growing illegitimacy rate which is already astounding. This is bad news.</p>

If they would stop being so &#8220;instant gratification&#8221; and teach kids to behave in school, apply themselves and wait to have children the community would do much better. However with the average low IQ this is not going to be the case and blaming &#8220;whitey&#8221; is so much easier. Inner city schools get money thrown at them with very little results.

<p>Because for blacks, in their natural environment, the African veldts and jungles, sociopathic narcissism is normal behavior.</p>
<p>What is NOT normal is expecting blacks to act like First World whites, follow white laws, compete with whites,  act with reason and logic, to adapt to First World white culture.  What&rsquo;s that old saw about putting a square peg in a round hole&hellip;.</p>

<p>Why is it that some people in this country (like the editorial staff at the New York Times) just seem to get it completely backwards? </p>
<p>What in God&rsquo;s name are they talking about, &#8220;inferior schools&#8221;? </p>
<p>Here in the New Orleans there are half a dozen &#8220;KIPP&#8221; charter schools that are 98% black. I&rsquo;m talking 99% black - one poor little blond-haired white kid in a school yard with 100 little black kids. These schools are free, they are staffed by highly-paid young Teach for America white geeks (they&rsquo;ll catch on soon) (maybe), and you can tell by looking at the facilities that the government really is spending about 15k per pupil. I mean they have been throwing money at education in the US for a long time now, to reduce that pesky achievement gap, and yet you hear over and over about &#8220;inferior&#8221; the schools are. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really getting tired of this c**p. As another poster said in the article about diversify Harvard&rsquo;s portrait collection &#8220;Let me out of here, I can&rsquo;t take it anymore.&#8221; (I actually hurt myself laughing - so perfect).</p>

		<p>Some of you don&rsquo;t understand what this is really about.  It&rsquo;s about collecting benefits, a sort of government job that doesn&rsquo;t require any work other than &#8220;gettin yo freak on&#8221; and giving birth to the next generation of America&rsquo;s criminal class.  Sixteen year old Shaniqua is tired of going to school and doesn&rsquo;t want to live with her mama anymore.  She finds someone to &#8220;hit dat&#8221;, gets pregnant and runs to the nearest welfare office to sign up for free housing, food stamps, and welfare checks.  Ka-Ching!!!!!! </p>

		<p>All sorts of things to be said here.</p>
<p>But let me note this: we have also had the Moral Majority and the Religious Right and &#8220;family values&#8221; conservatives and let us not forget Bill &#8220;Mr. Character&#8221; Bennett. And what has been the result? An exploding illegitimate birthrate. It&rsquo;s not enough to blame the liberal (though they do deserve to be pilloried for the welfare state, et alia). We might note that the aforementioned mainstream conservatives also rejected any racially based view of society. Yet their formulae have proven just as ineffective as those of the liberals. </p>
<p>Consider the statistics cited: &#8220;<b>The black community&rsquo;s 72 percent rate eclipses that of most other groups: 17 percent of Asians, 29 percent of whites, 53 percent of Hispanics and 66 percent of Native Americans were born to unwed mothers in 2008&hellip;</b>&#8221;</p>
<p>These stats correlate with the average IQs of each of these racial groupings. Regardless, these are some staggering figures, when you consider how marriage is supposed to be the central institution of society. Liberals flap around with their claims of &#8220;racism,&#8221; while conservatives pontificate about &#8220;values.&#8221; But if the real issue is race, then none of these bromides will rectify the demographic tidal wave.</p>
<p><i>Much has been made of the lack of marriageable black men,  </i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known black men with real jobs and who want to get married giving the other side of this: that black women are attracted to lowlifes and gangbangers, not decent guys; that black women are too obnoxious; that black women want to marry white men as a status symbol. So I&rsquo;d say that there is more to this than what we saw in the article. </p>
<p><i> Children of unmarried mothers of any race are more likely to perform poorly in school, go to prison, use drugs, be poor as adults, and have their own children out of wedlock. </i></p>
<p>You wonder if this is not a covert intent of welfare policies: wreck the family unit so that society becomes disrupted; then have the managerial state move in with its bureaucracies and enforcement systems to put in the boot. The left has always seen the traditional family as something of a pathology, the reserve of patriarchy and hierarchy and domestic abuse and so forth. Thus, the family is to be deconstructed and replaced with a &#8220;rainbow&#8221; of alternatives. </p>
<p>Just a thought. </p>
<p><i> The legacy of segregation, the logic goes, means blacks are more likely to attend inferior schools. </i></p>
<p>In case anyone hasn&rsquo;t looked at the calendar recently, segregation has been dead for five decades. We have had two generations of civil rights legislation, affirmative action, black studies departments, minority grants, hate crime laws, witch hunts over campus &#8220;racism,&#8221; liberal media promoting whitey-as-villain, etc.,etc.,etc. </p>
<p>The result is even more black dysfunction, and the general dragging down of the country. Liberals seem to operate in a time warp in which every day is 1954 with Brown v Board of Education just handed down from the bench. Much of the problem is that liberals do not want to recognize the failure of decades of their policies in force. Instead, they must ratchet up the propaganda machine to cover for the debacles they have created.</p>

<p>Do they ever get married in those places?  I am sure all of black nations have most of their babies out of wedlock. Commitment and monogamy has NEVER been a black trait. Even the slaves in our country practiced &#8220;their culture&#8221; and immorality abounded. Don&rsquo;t believe all these stories and films about what great family loving people they were. You can&rsquo;t change mother nature in these people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The real problem is that there isn&rsquo;t enough shame associated with bearing out of wedlock children&#8221;.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t use &#8216;shame&rsquo; anymore. Punishment, yes, for breaking the law but rarely shame. It&rsquo;s not used in a modern society. &#8216;Shame&rsquo; and repression burden the conscience and prevent citizens from reaching their full potential. Except for white men, they should be ashamed of their actions, their past and their greedy society. </p>
