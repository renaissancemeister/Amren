			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Times, Nov. 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seven months later, the effects of the boycott are coming into focus, showing that it has been a disruptive force but nowhere near as crippling as originally feared.</p>
<p>Businesses have lost lucrative contracts and conventions have relocated, performers have called off concerts, and cities and counties in about a dozen states passed resolutions to avoid doing business with Arizona. A report released Thursday says the boycott has cost the state $141 million in lost meeting and convention business since Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, signed the measure into law in April.</p>
<p>But the state&rsquo;s economy hasn&rsquo;t come to a screeching halt  &mdash;  as some who organized the boycott hoped. In fact, more people went to the Grand Canyon this summer than last year, and more stayed in Arizona&rsquo;s hotels and resorts, according to a review by the Associated Press.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many conventions decided not to move, despite questions from their members. At the Phoenix Convention Center on Thursday, about 1,300 exhibitors, distributors and buyers were attending an annual show sponsored by the National School Supply &amp; Equipment Association.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Liberal groups organized the boycott to slow the state&rsquo;s economy in much the same way that a boycott punished Arizona 20 years ago over its refusal to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. with a holiday.</p>
<p>This time, groups called on people not to fly Tempe-based US Airways or rent trucks from Phoenix-based U-Haul. There was talk of fighting Major League Baseball&rsquo;s plans for holding the All Star Game in Phoenix next year.</p>
<p>Most of those protests haven&rsquo;t come to fruition. The midsummer classic is still on, a spokeswoman for US Airways said the company saw no effect from the boycott call, and a U-Haul International executive said the same thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, year over year, we&rsquo;re up,&#8221; said Jim Pena, the Phoenix-based rental firm&rsquo;s president for Arizona.</p>
<p>Cities that called for boycotts, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, largely found themselves with few contracts to cancel and little Arizona travel to avoid.<br>

		<p>The report that said that 1070 cost the state tourism industry $141 million came from the Center for American Progress, a Soros-funded group headed by ex-Clintonite John Podesta.  Consider the source.</p>
<p>That study&rsquo;s main flaw is that SB 1070 was signed into law on April 23.  April through October are the slow months in Arizona tourism, mainly because of the heat, so you can&rsquo;t deduce anything from slow tourism business during those months.  Phoenix and Tucson are big corporate golf retreat towns, and the recession in general, not SB 1070, has eaten into that business.  However, the Grand Canyon, which does see good summer business, was up this summer compared to last, so this should bode well for the busy winter season in Phoenix and Tucson.</p>
<p>The next championship game for college football is in Glendale just after the turn of the year.  Be prepared for liberal whining about &#8220;boycotts&#8221; as the days and weeks lead up to that day.</p>

		<p>Last July I was scheduled for a business conference in San Francisco.  I cancelled and instead visited the Grand Canyon for the first time.  The South Rim was packed, with many of the tourists from other countries.</p>

		<p>For the first time ever, that I can recall, California has been running tourism ads on TV in our state.  Could it be that tourism is down because they are being informally boycotted by those who disapprove of their boycott of Arizona?</p>

		<p>I remember when the Arab League tried to impose a boycott on Isreal. That was dealt with very simply by Congress which  (pressured by the AJC)  passed a law, signed by Pres.Carter, making compliance by American companies illegal. End of story. </p>
<p>If we can fordid a boycott of another country, why cannot we do the same for our own state of Arizona? </p>
<p><i>&#8220;In 1977, Congress passed a law,signed by Pres. Carter, making compliance with the Arab boycott illegal.  For surveillance after the implementation of this law, an office called the &#8220;Office of Anti-boycott Compliance&#8221; was opened as part of the American Trade Ministry.  The Export Administration Act discourages, and in some circumstances prohibits. U.S. companies from furthering or supporting the boycott of Isreal sponsored by the Arab League, and certain Muslim countries, including requests for information designed to verify compliance with the boycott. Compliance with such requests may be prohibited by the Export Administration Regulations and may be reportable to the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s Bureau of Industry and Security.&#8221;</i>  [Wiki]</p>
<p>Since when can one state boycott another?  Is this not an act &#8220;in restraint of trade&#8221; or of interstate commerce, an area which is supposedly under federal authority and protection? </p>
<p>Things like this are warning signs of the disintegration of the United States, when the center can no longer hold the periphery.</p>

<p>Unless the state of Arizona mailed their welfare checks and other sorts of public (read paid for by taxpayers) assistance to out of state addresses, Arizona probably saved more than they lost by NOT having to spend money to support those ILLEGAL ALIEN INVADERS.</p>

		<p>I find it amusing that the City of Los Angeles would boycott Arizona. I am a business owner, and we all know that the City of LA does not pay its bills. That city owes a colleague of mine over $200K. They have owed him this bill for over two years now. This man is a small business owner, and that amount is devestating.  The City of LA is bankrupt, marxist, third world city. It&rsquo;s a pathetic excuse of what it used to be. Any boycott from LA is a blessing. What does Arizona have to loose, millions in fraudulent IOUs? Los Angeles, you&rsquo;re pathetic! You&rsquo;re a city that people avoid and move out of! You cannot &#8220;take your business elsewhere&#8221; if you don&rsquo;t have any money in the first place!</p>

<p>Several CA cities that are &#8220;boycotting&#8221; Arizona aren&rsquo;t boycotting an Arizona-based company that helps facilitate the red light camera (Cash Cows) those cities use.  Sometimes, principle takes a back seat to money.</p>
