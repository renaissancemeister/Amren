<h1>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Exacts a Heavy Toll Among Latinos</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judith Graham, Chicago Tribune, November 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s exacts a heavy toll among Latino Americans, who tend to get the condition almost seven years earlier than white Americans, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania and UC San Francisco.</p>
<p>Limited access to medical care and health insurance, lower levels of education and income, and higher rates of high blood pressure and diabetes contribute to above-average risks for Alzheimer&rsquo;s among Latino seniors, experts say.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer&rsquo;s Assn. calls the situation &#8220;a looming but unrecognized public health crisis&#8221; and predicts that Alzheimer&rsquo;s and related dementias could afflict 1.3 million older Latinos by 2050, up from about 200,000 currently.</p>
<p>In Chicago, a push to respond is being led by Constantina Mizis, a Mexican immigrant who founded the Latino Alzheimer&rsquo;s &amp; Memory Disorders Alliance, one of the few organizations of its kind in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Such efforts have to be undertaken with sensitivity, says Mizis, explaining that some Mexicans from rural areas believe Alzheimer&rsquo;s is punishment for sins of youth. Others think of cognitive difficulties as &#8220;just part of age&#8221;  &mdash;  something that families have to accept without asking for assistance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In many Latino families, however, adult day care is considered a type of warehouse. &#8220;They believe that if you leave someone there you have abandoned this person,&#8221; Mizis said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Education can be a complicating factor. People who have not had much education, including many Latino immigrants, tend to score lower on memory tests, and adjustments are needed to account for that, said Maria Marquine, a neuropsychologist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.</p>
<p>Language, too, can be a concern even when tests are translated into Spanish. Consider that car is carro in some Latino groups but auto and automovil in others, Marquine said. If the translation used in a memory test is unfamiliar, a senior&rsquo;s score could be affected.</p>

		<p>Recently there was a news story claiming that Hispanics outlived whites by a number of years, but now they have Alzheimer&rsquo;s at a higher rate, and I&rsquo;m sure that I have read they have a higher incidence of diabetes and heart disease.</p>
<p>I suppose this means we will see an increase of Hispanic octogenarians suffering from dementia, high blood sugar, and heart attacks.</p>

		<p>Are they going to say that Alzheimer&rsquo;s is a racist disease, now? They&rsquo;re dragging out the same old excuses for Hispanics having Alzheimer&rsquo;s, lack of health care, lack of health insurance, high blood pressure and diabetes.</p>
<p>I thought anyone in old age can get Alzheimer&rsquo;s. Ronald Reagan was a two-term president, had access to health care and health insurance and he wound up getting it.</p>

		<p>If true, this is a very valuable piece of information. IMO, almost all disease is diet related; diet meaning ALL things ingested in the human body. This should be one step closer to determining a possible contributing factor in this terrible disease. </p>

		<p>Is this real alzheimers (which has a strong genetic component) or just vascular dementia? The latter should be very common among americans no matter their color given the enormously large number of fat - I mean really really fat - people with sedentary lifestyles in USA. </p>

<p>But I thought old age was nothing but a social construct? </p>
<p>Sounds like it might be time for the AMA to demand the government put Surgeon General&rsquo;s Warnings on tacos. <br>

<p>There is no such thing as a &#8220;hispanic&#8221;&hellip;..but I can tell you from personal experience that white people who come from spanish speaking countries tend to not only live longer than whites but seem much younger than they are.  And alzheimer&rsquo;s and senile dementia (which are not the same things) are higher risk and more common.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is probably a cure for alheimers AND one for senile dementia.  These are just not widely in use yet.</p>
<p>For alzheimers it seems the cause is a build up of tumor necrosis factor in the brain.  This is the same thing that causes rheumatoid arthritis when it is present in the joints.  The arthritis drug Embrel, when injected into the spinal fluid at the base of the skull causes immediate and dramatic reversal of alzheimer&rsquo;s symptoms.  It probably also halts the physical damage TNF causes to the brain in the long term.  Bottom line.  Regular injection of Embrel into the spinal fluid when Alzheimers is detected early is probably a cure for the disease, halting its progression.  There are a number of research papers on this and a few Youtube clips for those of you interested in googling it.  Last time I checked, you could actually get this treatment if you lived nearby the guys researching it&hellip;.in california.</p>
<p>Senile dementia is a different disease, much more closely related to heart disease.  Basically the small blood vessels in the brain get plugged with predictable results.  Fascinating research on powerful new anti-oxident medications hint that these are likely a cure for all atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis related disease.  They were developed as a means to try and prevent restenosis (clogging up of an artery again), a common problem after angioplasty.  What was discovered is, all on their own, they cause reversal of clogged arteries.  Although not ready for consumption yet, these are probably a cure for all diseases related to plague buildup in various arteries.</p>
<p>My medical opinion is they are likely effective in treating cancer as well.  One of the aspects of cancer is oxidation damage of various types of cells.  Well known among &#8220;alternative med&#8221; types is that natural antioxidants are useful in preventing cancer.  Far more potent, drug level anti-oxidants&hellip;..well, there is alot of research to be done.</p>

		<p>Ah,HA!  So, now we are being set up to believe that millions of geezer Mestizos with Alzheimer&rsquo;s are wandering around in the desert, and unable to remember which side of the border belongs to them and which side of the border is the property of the direct descendants of the 100 percent European Founding Stock of this nation?</p>
<p>The Fix:  Build that double fence.   And, bring ALL of our troops home and station them along the border to make sure those geezers don&rsquo;t stumble across the line and start demanding free medical care for their Alzheimer&rsquo;s problems.  </p>

		<p>Everything wrong with blacks and hispanics is always some &#8216;racist conspiracy&rsquo; according to liberals.  If something is wrong with blacks or any nonwhite group, it&rsquo;s either a myth or the fault of whites (according to liberals).  Never will liberals or nonwhites with a chip on their shoulder ever hold themselves accountable for their own failures.</p>
