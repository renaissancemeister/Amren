<h1>Trident Squad Born in Response to &#8216;Executions&rsquo; on Street</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Justin Davenport, This Is London, November 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Operation Trident was launched 12 years ago in response to some of the most terrifying and brutal murders seen on London&rsquo;s streets.</p>
<p>Two victims were shot dead by a &#8220;Yardie&#8221; gang from Jamaica described later by a judge at the Old Bailey as an execution squad. One of those killed was an innocent young mother, shot in front of two of her children and her husband.</p>
<p>In the days before Trident, officers investigating so-called black-on-black gun crime faced huge difficulties, with some communities suspicious of them and potential witnesses too terrified to give evidence against the gunmen living among them.</p>
<p>Trident co-opted members of the black community to advise police on how to approach witnesses and communities.</p>
<p>However, the crime issues facing the squad are radically different today. Ten years ago most firearms murders in London were committed by so-called Yardies, Jamaican nationals who were often gang members aged about 28 to 35. Trident&rsquo;s role then was to investigate all firearms murders in London where both victim and killer were black. The motive usually involved drugs.</p>
<p>Today, the majority of killings Trident looks at are committed by British nationals, mostly in their teens or early twenties. Many are related to gang issues, or to trivial matters of respect, as well as drugs.</p>
<p>The victims and gunmen are usually black or mixed-race, with a blurring of the groups involved in gun crime and the drugs trade. This has led to some senior Scotland Yard officers arguing for a single murder squad for all homicides.</p>
<p>Trident&rsquo;s role has now evolved to cover all London shootings, black or white. Proactive teams target known gunmen and officers take an anti-crime message to schools, with lessons for children as young as six.<br/>

		<p><i>Today, the majority of killings Trident looks at are committed by British nationals, mostly in their teens or early twenties.</i></p>
<p>Translated into English, that means blacks born in the country instead of immigrant blacks.</p>
<p>If Trident is anything like similar efforts among big city American police departments, then it&rsquo;s probably the kind of thing black politicians wanted in the first place.  Then they&rsquo;ll eventually demand that it be dismantled because (surprise) it&rsquo;s netting too many black criminal suspects.  But Trident seems to be evading that:</p>
<p><i>Trident&rsquo;s role has now evolved to cover all London shootings, black or white.</i></p>
<p>So a unit formed specifically to squelch black gang violence involving guns now has to be called in to every random white murder just for the sake of fairness.</p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t have the slavery story to use as a justification in Britain, yet still manage to constitute themselves as a problem population. This seems to be duplicated everywhere they have a presence. The old, hackneyed sociological excuses sure have worn thin by now.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry White English folks. The killers and the victims in these latest cases are mostly people of color. Nothing to worry about. You should even feel sorry for these youths of color. </p>

		<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t have the slavery story to use as a justification in Britain&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, they will say it is an indirect result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. And of course &#8220;black on black&#8221; as they say. The media will now say that England has a high rate of gun crime, and compared to yesteryear, this true, BUT ONLY AMONG CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE &#8220;POPULACE&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reputation of the English, as I have said before, prior to WW2, was that the citizens of Great Britain were the MOST law-abiding persons in the world. It seems that time has passed. &#8220;Englishmen&#8221;? Ask youself.</p>

		<p>I thought that Britain&rsquo;s draconian gun laws were supposed to stop all this gun crime.<br/>
They seemed so sure it would. What happened?</p>

<p>This is just linguistic mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>All it means is that the so-called, &#8220;British nationals&#8221; are just Jamaican blacks who were born in Britain. There is nothing &#8220;British&#8221; about them other then what their passport says.</p>

		<p>Reply to anonymous at #3:</p>
<p> &#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry White English folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why use the adjective &#8220;white&#8221;? That the English are white goes without even saying. Would you say &#8220;Yellow Japanese folks&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;The killers and the victims in these latest cases are mostly people of color&#8221;.</p>
<p>And your point is? Why should these people even BE IN ENGLAND ANYWAYS?</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to worry about&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d sure be worried about being an innocent bystander being caught up in the middle, wouldn&rsquo;t you? It happens all the time. And even with most of the &#8220;victims&#8221; being blacks, I would still bet my bottom dollar more English people are killed or victimised by crime by blacks then the reverse. In any case there was ZERO black crime in Britain when there were ZERO blacks in Britain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should even feel sorry for these youths of color&#8221;.</p>
<p>WHY? I ask that again, WHY? Why should the &#8220;White English&#8221; people feel sorry for these &#8220;youths&#8221; of color? WHY? They have no business even being in Britain and are making trouble, behaving violently and engaging in homicides. Why should the English people feel anything but disgust towards these &#8220;youths&#8221; of color?</p>

<p> How dare they use the term &#8220;mixed race&#8221; in their openly racist article. This is insulting to all people of color. The term used should be &#8220;Enriched&#8221; British,  or Diverse British, or British Sun People, or Uniquely British, or Hybrid Vigorous British or better still  &mdash;   Cosmic Race, &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; British.</p>
