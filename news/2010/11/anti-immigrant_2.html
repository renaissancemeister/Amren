			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Squires, Telegraph (London), Nov. 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Right-wing political party in Switzerland has produced a provocative anti-immigration campaign in which a photograph of naked young models wading into Lake Zurich is contrasted with an image of headscarf-wearing Muslim women bathing in filthy water. </p>
<p>The campaign is meant to warn the Swiss of what could happen to the country if it allows greater immigration.</p>
<p>It comes as the Alpine nation prepares to vote on whether immigrants who commit serious crimes should be automatically expelled.</p>
<p>The online campaign was produced by a regional branch of the Swiss People&rsquo;s Party (SVP), the largest in parliament and the country&rsquo;s biggest political force.</p>
<p>The first image shows a rear view of four young women holding hands and standing in the shallows of Lake Zurich.<br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Zurich.jpg" src="/news/2010/11/22/Zurich.jpg" width="450" height="560" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span><br>
The second shows a group of elderly women, possibly Albanians or Bosnians, wearing headscarves and smoking as they immerse themselves in muddy water. It is supposed to represent a vision of Switzerland 20 years from now.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the SVP told The Daily Telegraph that the controversial images had been created by party activists in Wohlen, west of Zurich, and would not be adopted nationally.</p>
<p>Switzerland will hold a referendum next week in which voters can decide whether foreigners who have been found guilty of murder, rape, drugs trafficking and other serious offences should be deported.</p>
<p>The expulsion initiative was put forward by the SVP, which has won support by capitalising on fears about foreigners, who currently make up more than a fifth of Switzerland&rsquo;s population of 7.7 million.</p>
<p>Recent polls show that 54 per cent of Swiss voters would vote in favour of the measure while 43 per cent are against it.</p>
<p>The federal Justice Ministry has warned that a &#8220;yes&#8221; vote on Nov 28 could bring Switzerland into conflict with international obligations such as the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, colour, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>Switzerland drew international condemnation last year after voters backed a ban, proposed by the SVP, on the construction of new minarets.</p>
<p>The party also caused outrage with a poster showing a group of white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag. <br>

		<p>While I do not agree with nude bathing these images will certainly attract attention! And in politics there is probably no such thing as bad publicity.</p>
<p>Now come to the other side of the world, from time to time Muslim women wear their medievil robes into Sydney&rsquo;s surf beaches. The results are disasterous and make it very difficult for the life savers to assist them when they start to drown.</p>
<p>Again a cultural issue, but if Muslims want to come to either Switzerland or Sydney for a better life they should be prepared to accept the ways of their adopted country, INTERGRATE and exchange the Burqua for a Bikini if necessary! Better still stop them invading us in the first place.</p>
<p>In the meantime we all bow down to these &#8220;international obligations&#8221; or EU Conventions. What has happened to the sovereign rights of nations? </p>

		<p>Very pretty young women.  It&rsquo;s a shame they have to be exploited opposite such ugliness make a racial point, it almost feels like waving a flag in front of a bull to advertise how much better we are.</p>
<p>At running away.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a time when being Swiss was an exclusive club that only the ultra wealthy could join?  I coulda sworn from the 40s through the Cold War they were pretty picky about whom they let traipse across their country.</p>
<p>I also seem to recall they had some rather harsh words with the Muslims the last time they popped into their neck of the woods&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, in the end, it&rsquo;s all about the demographics.  Someone has 4-6 kids to your &#8216;1 point something&rsquo; and they win.  Go to replacement level and they -still- win.  It just takes longer.</p>
<p>Has anyone done the math to determine whether stopping the tide now will do anything for anyone, in 20 years time?</p>

		<p>Well, I must say! Quite beautiful! But couldn&rsquo;t they have brushed the sand off their bottoms?</p>
<p>But, seriously,  this points out something profound  &mdash;  the innocence of the West (after all, it is just WOMEN!) and the presumed &#8220;decadence&#8221; of the Muslim women (even when it is ONLY WOMEN). I am a firm believer in chastity and fidelity, but I also appreciate the beauty of the female form. The Muslims attach all sorts of evil to the human form, as, to be fair,  have done Christians in previous centuries.</p>
<p>But why should this dichotomy exist? Why can&rsquo;t the beauty of the female form be acknowledged, along with the higher beauty and dedication of chastity and fidelity?</p>
<p>Such things can be taught, and were done so in pagan societies.</p>
<p>But no, Semitic religion seems to have a &#8220;one-size fits all&#8221; model, and that model is that the human form is corrupt, and contemplating the beauty of the female form leads to the gateway of hell.</p>
<p>This is not the way of the West.  </p>
<p>But, to be quite honest, by looking at them, the Muslim women would display a nudity that would be quite despressing.</p>
<p>Of course, this picture is symbolic  &mdash;  a parable  &mdash;  but being such, it is so much the stronger! Brilliant! </p>

		<p>This is a terrible ad. The timeline is all wrong. If you showed someone 40 years ago the &#8216;Swiss 2010&rsquo; photo complete with naked bodies in the pool, no one would have believed it. The ad would make more sense if the second photo had the caption &#8216;Swiss 2050&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s completely inaccurate!</p>

		<p>While race-conscious whites often despise Freud, the fact is, sex drives much of what we do, positive and negative. The Muslims are sexual perverts, committing atrocious sexual acts in the dark. To the extent that sex is healthy, and empowers women, it is essential that the European nations recognize the power of sex to instill pride and self-confidence in both men and women.  The German Nazis tried the women are cows philosophy; like much of their botched Darwinism, it didn&rsquo;t work. A contemporary ideology of European pride should include the strenght, including sexual strength and beauty, of both men and women, as an essential element of power.  Freud is more complex than the Woody Allen moronic Catskills Jewish humorists have portrayed.<br>
Not only is Western art so much superior to Muslim concrete blockhouse mosques, poetry and critical thinking, but the West&rsquo;s ability to appreciate a mature version of sex and of irony can prove an attractive and effective weapon against these ignorant one-dimensional barbarians.</p>

		<p>Six years ago, when I was vacationing in europe the whitest places were the nude beaches and resorts. Non-whites hate public nudity. If you want to drive out the non-whites, encourage more nude beaches, resorts, ect.<br>
    I know a number of you may be modest, but when you see the non-whites, especially the moslems objecting, you will take off your clothes and join the fun.</p>

		<p>Deporting foreigners &#8220;who have been found guilty of murder, rape, drugs trafficking and other serious offences&#8221; sounds reasonable to me. Deporting the European Convention on Human Rights sounds even more reasonable. The EU was ushered into power over the protests of the people. Since they&rsquo;ve been in power they have orchestrated one power grab after another. They are tyrants and should be considered as such.</p>

<p>(Gee, I wonder if they should be punished? That&rsquo;s a hard one! What do you think?  Maybe we should take a vote and figure this out. After all, we don&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone! And we must be careful not to seem prejudiced or racist.)</p>
<p><br>
Take a vote???   Sorry, but all this wrangling (going on all over the Western world, about punishing criminal aliens and deporting illegals) is simply surreal. I can&rsquo;t believe there is anything to discuss!  It&rsquo;s like debating whether 2 and 2 make four. Shouldn&rsquo;t that be obvious?  Would you take a vote?  In a sane world, they would be deported instantly, and that would be that. </p>
<p>The mere fact that there is such a debate - or such a vote   &mdash;   shows how far ALL the Western countries have fallen under alien ideological control. They are no longer able to do what is good for themselves, and are paralyzed by internal bickering.</p>

		<p>Also, the diversity of the models  &mdash;  even though they are naked  &mdash;  is obvious. The different colors and textures of hair, different shoulder widths, different-sized and shaped derrières. Some have rather long backs, some are shorter. And this is just from the back!</p>
<p>I think this was also an intention of the ad, in symbolic form  &mdash;  to emphasize that Moslems want to make all women the same  &mdash;  a walking tent. </p>
<p>Women of the West are beautifully diverse; and more importantly, this White diversity is valued. </p>

<p>I advise the young, heavy-male nationalists (and understandably hormonal) to restrain their base impulses and remain tasteful - nudity okay, but this pic reveals rather much. </p>
<p>*Yes, I understand their intent perfectly. The nationalists want the population to appreciate the beauty of Swiss women. Thus oppose immigration. Thus vote SVP. But unfortunately that&rsquo;s not how the ordinary citizen will react.*</p>
<p>By advertising themselves a party of horny men they&rsquo;re apt to lose the votes of women as well as middle-aged family men (not to mention seniors) who, very naturally will question their fitness to rule.</p>

__________</p>
<p>Probably the Left would claim it was &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; punishment.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Swiss police are biased.  What else?  Why are they arresting so many foreigners?  Why so many persons of color? That&rsquo;s proof of bigotry.</p>
<p>Gotta get out there and arrest more white murders, rapists, and muggers!  Equalize those numbers and stop discriminating against non-whites!</p>
<p>Everyone knows all people are the same, race is in your head. So, all crime statistics should be the same. Until then, there is something wrong with the justice system. The Swiss are clearly a nation of bigots (like all whites).</p>
<p>One more good reason for race replacement! Gotta elect a new people. There&rsquo;ll never be Peace and Justice until the world is free of whites.  Utopia at last!</p>

<p>Here in the US the folks supposedly on &#8220;our side&#8221; are usually ~ 80 years old and insist on talk, talk, talk about taxes, monetary policies, Constitutions etc - not very sexy. </p>
<p>Our people need to get sexier.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about 20% of the Swiss population being foreigners. Turns out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland#Demographics" rel="nofollow">60% of them are fellow Europeans</a>. So the country is about 92% white. Typical misleading &#8220;statistic&#8221; from the MSM.</p>
<p>Given the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland#Foreign_relations_and_international_institutions" rel="nofollow">Switzerland is not a member of the EU</a>, I doubt if the &#8220;European Convention on Human Rights&rdquo; has any force or authority there. If I&rsquo;m wrong, then the next referendum should be on withdrawal from that convention.</p>
<p>&#8220;hcl&#8221; (#27) and others need to get a grip. Europeans don&rsquo;t get their knickers in a twist over nudity the way most Americans do. Nude beaches and other clothing-optional recreation are the rule in many countries including Switzerland, not the exception, and have been for many decades. There&rsquo;s even a German word for it   &mdash;   <i>Freikörperkultur</i> (&#8220;free body culture&#8221;), or FKK for short. Seen from a European perspective, then, the poster&rsquo;s message is perfectly clear: Clothing-optional swimming is another time-honored cultural tradition that is jeopardized by non-white (and especially Muslim) immigration, so rejecting such immigration is an essential means of preserving that tradition. I applaud the SVP for their ability to produce such powerful visual statements; this one is even better than the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/SVP-anti-minaret-poster.jpg" rel="nofollow">anti-minaret poster</a> or the <a href="/_gwEvp95dIvg/SxRqpD4cJnI/AAAAAAAAAbA/fciWdQ92Pdc/s1600/svp_01a.jpg" rel="nofollow">black sheep poster</a>. About the closest anyone has gotten over here is the &#8220;white hands&#8221; ad that got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Helms#1990_reelection_campaign" rel="nofollow">Jesse Helms re-elected to the Senate</a> in 1990.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Can somebody tell me how deporting persons convicted of serious crimes comes to be discrimination based on race, color, religion, or nationality???&#8221;</p>
<p>It implies that you prefer the criminal committing crimes elsewhere, in other words that you would rather people elsewhere be the victims of crime than your own people. That is the discrimination. The fact that this is not obvious here, when it is obvious to even to most apolitical ordinary person on the street, is telling about the moral level of the people who support this site.</p>

<p><br>
I  generally agree with your post, but some points should be clarified:</p>
<p>Switzerland is surrounded by the EU.  <br>
Switzerland&rsquo;s major trading partner is the EU.<br>
Switzerland has  filed an application for membership in the EU.<br>
Switzerland is a small country surrounded by large countries.<br>
Over 900,000 citizens of the EU   live there; many others work or have business there.<br>
The Swiss government desires entry to the EU, while the voters oppose it.<br>
There are many binding agreements with the EU, membership or not.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Thus, Switzerland has to heed pressure and opinion from the EU.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, many of  those &#8220;fellow Europeans&#8221; are Bosnians and other Moslems  from the Balkans, who are culturally and ethnically very different from the Swiss.   </p>
<p>Also,  while many of those  &#8220;fellow Europeans&#8221; may  technically  be  citizens of other European countries (as France), they are in fact Africans and Arabs holding EU citizenship.  A visit to Geneva  or its French suburbs will show you very vividly who those &#8220;fellow Europeans&#8221; really are.   To assume that they are white  (because of EU citizenship) is erroneous, and to call the country 92% white is ridiculous. Your eyes will tell you otherwise.</p>
<p>Personally, I suspect that a large part of that 43% against deportation came from Geneva and its region. If you subtracted Geneva, the vote for deportation would be much higher. If you subtracted all  of the the large cities, the vote would  be even higher still. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;To reconcile the wish for Swiss integration into the EU with the reluctance of the Swiss people to share sovereignty, the bilateral relations between the two parties have been intensified during the years without achieving full membership. On a technical level, circa 100 bilateral agreements are currently managed through a structure of more than 15 joint committees.    Being member of EFTA, Swiss FTAs are usually concluded in the EFTA framework.<br>
 <br>
Switzerland is coming continuously closer to the rest of Europe. While the integration process within the European Union continues to progress, Switzerland adopts many of its regulations, laws and norms.</i>&#8221; <br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/27q79c4" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/27q79c4</a></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Relations between Switzerland and the European Union are framed by a series of bilateral treaties <b>whereby Switzerland adopts EU law in order to participate </b> in the EU&rsquo;s single market.&#8221;</i>   [Wiki]</p>
<p>PS to hcl:  That picture is not the European concept of pornography. If it were pornograpy, you would know it! Nor does it appeal to &#8220;base impulses&#8221; and &#8220;horny men&#8221;. And it&rsquo;s not un-friendly to families. They have simply realized what toothpaste and automobile companies discovered long ago - that sex sells. There&rsquo;s no better way to get attention.</p>

		<p>There are many comments here about muslim women and most that have seen my comments know my opinion of mOOslims. But you should be aware that there is a tremendous number of fabulously beautiful muslim Arab women who desperately want OUT of the muslim ideaology of oppression, abuse and depression and desire the freedom of the West. I personally knew a number of Kuwaiti girls going to college where I live and after graduation they disappeared to avoid being DRAGGED back to Saudi. One of them, didn&rsquo;t go far enough and was found (captured) by her Saudi family and FORCED through the small local airport screaming for help and our police would do nothing, she was over 18 and wanted to stay, but our government at all levels kiss so much Saudi muslim butt that these girls were thrown back to the worse place they could have been sent to.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really partial to beautiful European women.  The immigrants don&rsquo;t help my morale in this regard.  Pointier heads can discuss merits and negatives about the broader issue.  I&rsquo;d rather be more base and discuss whether the &#8220;new ones&#8221; are eye candy or eye sore.</p>

&#8220;Take a vote??? Sorry, but all this wrangling (going on all over the Western world, about punishing criminal aliens and deporting illegals) is simply surreal.&#8221; <br>
&ldquo;all this wrangling is surreal. I can&rsquo;t believe there is anything to discuss! It&rsquo;s like debating whether 2 and 2 make four. &hellip;The mere fact that there is such a debate, or such a vote, shows how far al the Western countries have fallen under alien ideological control.

<p>I totally agree with you that this is the real point here. Can you imagine the same situation in say Saudi Arabia? The referendum would be to vote on whether such felons should be amputated in one or two limbs before deportation. The deportation itself would be a non-issue</p>

<p>Actually, most immigrants are from Germany, France and Italy, also from surrounding countries. The largest &#8220;non-EU&#8221; immigrant group are from Albania and Kosovo who are white (apart from the Gypsies among them).</p>
<p>Switzerland, just like the other countries in Western Europe&#8221; gradually darkens toward the French speaking part. Most blacks in Switzerland (whether they are from France or Africa) lives in the west, German Switzerland contains most of the Albanians, former Yugoslavians and Turks (here also not many non-whites). Italian and Romansh parts are almost completely white. </p>

<p>They seem to consider deportation &#8216;punishment&rsquo; as, to be a bit presumptuous, so apparently do you. Do you think those convicted of serious crimes should not be punished? Or even instead rewarded.</p>
