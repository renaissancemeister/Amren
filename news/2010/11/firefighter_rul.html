<h1>Firefighter Ruling Sets Stage for Damages</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Gryta, Buffalo News, October 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thirteen white firefighters were treated unfairly when the City of Buffalo voided the promotional tests they passed because minorities did poorly on the exams, State Supreme Court Justice John A. Michalek ruled Friday.</p>
<p>His decision sets the stage for a future decision on financial damages and promotions for the firefighters, should an appeal be rejected.</p>
<p>The judge noted that the city has contended in a federal court case that all promotional tests are racially neutral and job-oriented. But in the state court case brought by the white firefighters, the city argued that the tests administered in 2005 and 2006 should be voided because of racial problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In ruling against the city, Michalek cited the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s June 2009 ruling that officials in New Haven, Conn., illegally tossed out fire department promotional tests because no African-Americans and only two Hispanics scored high enough to receive promotions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michalek also cited the testimony of former City Human Resources Commissioner Leonard Matarese, who said that he let the 2005 and 2006 promotional lists affecting the 13 white firefighters expire because of &#8220;the fear of future litigation&#8221; by MOCHA about those lists.</p>

		<p>When liberal city governments toss the coin, it&rsquo;s heads, blacks win; tails, whites lose.  It&rsquo;s good that a court agreed with the unfairness of that.  Special privileges for blacks is not equal treatment under the law.</p>

		<p>Assuming the conservatives take one of the congressional houses, I would be most interested to see if a bill is introduced, reported out of the Judiciary committee, and passed and sent to the Senate, that declares affirmative action, by the Feds, states, private employers, school systems, colleges or private organizations of any type, to be illegal and not sanctioned by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or any other piece of prior legislation. </p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t happen, even if every new &#8220;Republican and/or conservative&#8221; member of Congress proclaims undying love for the Tea Party and the Constitution.</p>
<p>Time for a new Constitution.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t like the Enron case, &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t like the results, I got others.&#8221;  Aside from issues of intelligence, if one party studies and the other doesn&rsquo;t wouldn&rsquo;t you expect different results?  Its an odd game, the employees union in conjunction with the City agree to use a third party test that has been accepted elsewhere.  Then when the results don&rsquo;t come out the way the City wants, they don&rsquo;t accept them.</p>

The Buffalo Fire Department has been under a consent decree for decades.</p>
<p>Since they couldn&rsquo;t find enough qualified blacks in Buffalo to meet their &#8216;quota&rsquo; for the last recruiting exam, they had a national search.</p>
<p>People from all over came to Buffalo to take the test. Even so, they still couldn&rsquo;t find enough qualified blacks so they threw out the test which made many people justifiably angry.</p>
<p>The promotional exam and the recruiting exam are two different things but the racial jousting and reputations are common to both.</p>

		<p>Racial games that place lower qualified blacks in public safety positions will only lead to more deaths.  But hey, we can&rsquo;t let a few dead bodies stand in the way of racial progress!</p>

		<p>Firefighting is a job requiring both courage and a high level of profiency in order to save lives.  There should be no compromises in personnel requirements in recruiting applicants for such positions, any more than there should be for recruiting airline pilots, high-iron construction workers, ship captains, or commercial fishermen.</p>
<p>Safety considerations should never be waived for purposes of affirmative action, the operative definition of which is lowering performance standards in order to exhibit higher levels of minority hiring.  In a perfect (or even slightly better) world, job requirements would never be lowered in order to admit unqualified applicants, minorities or not.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s mind-blowing. These tests were given in 2005 and 2006 and the courts STILL haven&rsquo;t resolved the case. What in the world are these &#8220;justice&#8221; officials doing all day long? Why does everything take years and years and years to move through the system? What ever happened to &#8220;justice delayed is justice denied?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Jethro #5: I have been denied position after position, or told that I was competing for three out of the seven open spots for one Police exam, which I had scored 95%, so the other four spots could be used to hire women and minorities. How is any of that fair? </p>
<p>I was denied numerous Civil Service positions and the right to a career, to get married sooner, to start a family earlier, and to plan a retirement, for which I would have been retired by now, and on to another career, which I had planned for, long ago. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s alright that I and other White men struggle for a career, for which we tested, had medical and background checks, and all the right College credentials to make good Police Officers, Firemen, State Troopers, etc., but all that time working hard in High School, and College, as well as staying out of trouble,never paid off, as we all were told it would.</p>
<p>Well, at least we never went to Reform School or Prison. </p>
<p>But it sickens me for what passes for a Cop or Fireman, today, much less a Teacher or College Professor. </p>
<p>Forget Civil Service positions. Don&rsquo;t waste your time and money on the filing fees. Who needs to kill a Saturday taking an exam that you&rsquo;ll pass, then wait six months to get the results, and what seems like a lifetime for an interview, only to be passed over by the trash that does the hiring, who wants to hire more trash? Screw it!</p>
<p>Go for a profession like Engineering, or Trades like Plumbing, Electrician, Carpenter, or Locksmith. They can&rsquo;t outsource those jobs, and people will always needs tham. </p>
