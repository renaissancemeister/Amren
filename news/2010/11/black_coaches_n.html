<h1>Black Coaches? Not in SW Fla.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Dorsey, News-Press (Fort Myers, Florida), November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are about 500 African-American high school football players in Lee and Collier counties. They have zero men of their race in varsity head coaching positions.</p>
<p>The thousands before them, who&rsquo;ve played over the previous 40 years, have had four such role models.</p>
<p>Transforming high school demographics, an estimated 40 percent African-American player base and a flood of prominent black assistant football coaches have hardly changed the demographics of head coaching positions since 1969 and 1994.</p>
<p>Those years stand out for two reasons: Area schools were integrated in &rsquo;69; North Fort Myers High School graduate Larry Gary became the area&rsquo;s first black head varsity football coach in &rsquo;l;94 at Lehigh Senior High School.</p>
<p>Since 1969, there have been 101 varsity head football coaching hires in Lee County. Four times those hires have gone to African-Americans; Gary was hired twice, and counts as two.</p>
<p>Collier County has had 54 hires during that time span. Darryl Bullock, hired in 1995 at Immokalee, is the lone black man to get a job.</p>
<p>In the two counties, the five hires in 155 chances adds up to 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holloway [Cape Coral High black wide receiver Prince Holloway] said black coaches are viewed differently from their white counterparts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure how many black coaches have tried out&#8221; for head coaching jobs, Holloway said. &#8220;Most don&rsquo;t want to deal with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>By &#8220;it,&#8221; Holloway meant dealing with the stereotype black coaches coax blacks to pick their school.</p>
<p>Former Cape Coral principal Charles Dailey, who is black and one of four men in Lee County to have hired a black head football coach since integration, said more efforts need to be made to hire qualified black coaches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It needs to be culturally diverse to where kids can see minorities in leadership roles, not only for black kids to see African-American or Hispanic coaches, but for white kids to see African-American coaches and white kids to see Hispanic coaches in leadership roles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Estero High coach Rich Dombroski, who is white and was hired by Principal George Clover in 2008, said black coaches aren&rsquo;t getting interview opportunities. {snip} remains a goal. New to the area, he has not applied for a top job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Lehigh and again as an assistant at Bishop Verot, Gary said he faced a stigma that he recruited players.</p>
<p>Five players transferred from Lehigh to Bishop Verot in 1999 as Gary took a job there. But Gary said players transfer to schools with white coaches in Lee all the time.</p>
<p>Dunbar High School Principal Carl Burnside, who is black, said he guarded against another stereotype. He has hired three head coaches for his school&rsquo;s football program. All were white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NFL has the Rooney Rule, named for Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney, which requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for every vacant coaching job.</p>
<p>Former Lee County Superintendent James Browder said such a rule would not be viable at the high school level because coaches are usually hired as teachers first. Lee County teachers association president Mark Castellano concurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a business,&#8221; Castellano said. &#8220;This is an educational situation. As long as they&rsquo;re not discriminating, I&rsquo;m not going to have an issue with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The subject continues to be sensitive. The 12 Lee County School District principals who have hired a head football coach were approached for comment on this issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seven agreed to be interviewed. All were posed the same questions:</p>
<p>- When you last hired a football coach, how many men did you interview?</p>
<p>- How many of them were minorities?</p>
<p>- Why do you think that in 41 years, there have been so few black coaches?</p>
<p>Five principals indicated they liked to interview five candidates before making a decision. Of the 25 most recently interviewed varsity football coaching candidates, two were black, said the principals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look at the person, I don&rsquo;t look at the color,&#8221; said South Fort Myers Principal Tommy O&rsquo;Connell. &#8220;I look for the most qualified person that I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, if you just take the number of the teaching staff and looked at race, I&rsquo;d bet that 90 percent or 85 percent in high school are white,&#8221; said Davis [East Lee Principal Ron Davis].</p>
<p>In the 2009-10 school year, 87.6 percent of Lee County teachers were white, 5.4 percent black and 6.2 percent Hispanic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 15.3 percent of students were black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Troy Davis, the most recently hired black varsity head football coach in the region  &mdash;  by Dailey in 2005 at Cape Coral  &mdash;  coaches postgraduate Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Va.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s racist,&#8221; Davis said of why more men of his race have not gotten opportunities. &#8220;I just think that the athletic directors and the superintendent and principals need to do a better job of finding guys, more than just having the same guys rotating through.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sick of this constant nonsense claim that Black youth need to learn from someone that looks like them. Why isn&rsquo;t this true for other races? I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone crying that we need more White teachers and coaches for Whites. And I&rsquo;ve never seen that claim be made for Asians either. They seem to have no problem learning from Whites. So why is that we only hear this claim with regards to Blacks and to a lesser extent Hispanics?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this an admission that Blacks are so different from Whites that they can&rsquo;t relate to each other? If Blacks have issues learning from and being coached by Whites, then it seems clear that we really shouldn&rsquo;t be living together as they&rsquo;re a people so far removed from the White race that they lack the basic capacity to even be taught by Whites. </p>

		<p>I have to assume black guys are like white guys when it comes to football: even if they can&rsquo;t play it, they will readily teach those who can, provided it&rsquo;s on their terms.  How many are actually qualified in the tactical and athletic realities of such training, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Since 1969, there have been 101 varsity head football coaching hires in Lee County. Four times those hires have gone to African-Americans; Gary was hired twice, and counts as two.</p>
<p>Collier County has had 54 hires during that time span. Darryl Bullock, hired in 1995 at Immokalee, is the lone black man to get a job.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I wonder what the percentages of white teaching base vs. qualified (athletic) black teaching base are in each county and specifically in what economic climates a school can afford to hire someone -just- for their football skills&hellip;</p>
<p>Where there is a large white base of qualified teachers, a white male teacher with head coach material in him is both more likely to pop up and to succeed-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
In the two counties, the five hires in 155 chances adds up to 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>In the 2009-10 school year, 87.6 percent of Lee County teachers were white, 5.4 percent black and 6.2 percent Hispanic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 15.3 percent of students were black.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Against a smaller pool of black head coaches who are qualified.</p>
<p>I frankly don&rsquo;t see the issue here.  5.4 percent of the teaching body being black and 3.2 of historical head coaches being black implies that, _from a national population percentage_ of 6% black males overall, 3.2% or a little over half, have the skillset to be accomplished in both roles, as teacher and coach.</p>
<p>That sounds about right to me, even if the local percentages are a little higher, at 15%.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this reflects actual ethnic teaching percentages at individual schools either.  If these hispanic or black kids need an edge to bring them into the game, scholastically and athletically, by all means, concentrate the appropriate school population with the correct teachers in a single facility and let them have a real shot at seeing role models all around them.</p>
<p>They call it segregation as a slur and a con for more money.  </p>
<p>But is it, really?  Black charter/magnet schools seem to work when there are high aptitude student bodies brought together with highly qualified black instructors strictly to learn in a structured environment.  For those not in the top 20% of the bell curve, why can&rsquo;t black intermediate education and perhaps real world vocational training be accompanied with a successful athletics program as a draw for the rest of the population?</p>
<p>The one thing I disagree with is the assumption that white students &#8216;must&rsquo; do something to make blacks feel good as a function of trading positions of authority.  If the coach is qualified, okay.  If it&rsquo;s just more social engineering.  NO.</p>

		<p>Maybe what we need to do is bring back school segregation. Put all the black kids in black schools, all of the white children in white schools, etc&hellip; Then only hire teachers who for classes of their own race. This will provide all students role models of their own race, eliminate racial tension in schools, and provide a proportionally fair number of teaching jobs for blacks.</p>

		<p>Two out of twenty-five applicants.  That&rsquo;s eight percent.  This is the &#8220;problem&#8221; here, if you consider it a problem at all.  It&rsquo;s just not probable that the best applicant will be found in an eight percent subset of the applicant pool, even if these men were white.  When they&rsquo;re not white the likelihood drops even more.  </p>
<p>If more blacks want to be hired, more need to apply.  My father worked in a machine shop for over twenty years and told me that they hired young guys all the time off the street with no experience whatsoever, so long as they were willing to learn.  Forget finding black candidates with the aptitude, they couldn&rsquo;t find black candidates period.  </p>
<p>It must be that conspiracy perpetrated by the Evil White Man preventing black guys from getting off the bus on their way downtown to the welfare office and applying at the machine shop.  </p>
<p>Because we all know that in situations like this we must abandon logic and consider what I like to call Sharpton&rsquo;s razor: </p>
<p>The simplest explanation is usually RACISS!</p>

		<p>Having grown up in Desoto county which borders on Lee county.<br>
 I must say we had a black football coach who was also the high schools dean. I must say he was probably the black man I have respected the most in my life.<br>
 He was an old school &#8220;community leader&#8221; who believed in personal responsibility. I personally watch him many time reading unruly blacks the riot act. Telling them that when they acted like fools it didn&rsquo;t only reflect on them and their parents but on him and every member of the black community. And he usually told them while putting a paddle on their tails. About the time that rap music got big and the crime in black areas skyrocketed several young black thugs beat him so severely he wasn&rsquo;t the same again.<br>
 I guess the message of personal responsibility wasn&rsquo;t what they wanted to hear when rap encouraged their destructive behavior. When the adults among the group that beat him went to trail they got the maximum sentence possible with the blessing of the black community. <br>
Too bad there aren&rsquo;t more black men like him.  </p>

		<p>Why is no one worried about the overrepresentation of blacks in football? How many black football players finish four yr college programs, even with the easy classes, tutors, and low GPA allowances they receive?  The NFL?  Yes, most players are black, but how many are over 30? How many become coaches at major colleges or pro teams after the career ends?  Football is more than how fast you run a 40 or how high you can jump for a pass. Like all competitive sports, its a combination of intelligence and excellent physical skill. Good inter-personal talent helps, including the ability to manage all ethnic groups on a team and different psychological traits.If all you know is the hip hop narrow-thinking black youth culture, your coaching skills will be nil.</p>
<p>Some black players have the combination of requirements. They would make good coaches. They, like a Tony Dungee, will market themselves, and eventually the marketplace will find and hire them.</p>
<p>Others, the majority, are no more than 50% qualified. They had physical skills when they played. Period.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what catches up to them when it&rsquo;s time for a post-playing career.</p>

		<p>So wait a second&hellip;</p>
<p>If you have a team, which is 70% white, you must have a black coach because you need diversity but if you have a 70% black team, you must have a black coach either, because the team is majority black.</p>
<p>Liberal logic.</p>

now categorized as Black, that very visible &#8220;shades&#8221; of difference would exist in Whitey&rsquo;s absence inasmuch as correlations emerge between degrees of pigmentation  whiteness and job task complexities.  It is, as far as I know, a largely neglected topic of American historical scholarship as to what any kind  of &#8220;census&#8221;/ slave sale/  data in the old South would reveal about this correlation.  </p>

		<p>The amount of any ethnic, racial or religious representation in public schools should be in proportion to the amount of paid taxes from  each diverse grouping; since this position has never nor will ever happen; &#8220;blacks and browns&#8221; have been far and away the benefactors of such inequalities of not carrying their &#8221; own weight &#8221; socially in a positive way; &#8221; they want all the benies or percs but not the responsibility of paymentor creation of a job category.</p>

		<p>The reason that there are so few Black coaches (aside from the local demographics) is that our whole educational system was created by whites.  Africans just don&rsquo;t create the same type of educational institutions that whites do.  Black Americans are governed by white compulsory attendance laws so they have to comply with those laws.  All they can do is copy the form of the white school system, but they cannot, from their own ranks, produce the staff the school needs.  In this case, Blacks apparently expect the laws to be be bent so that Blacks get what they want: one of their own kind coaching young black athletes.  This, despite that only 5.4% of the teaches are black and only 15.3% of the students at large are black.  Undoubtedly the sports teams are overwhelmingly black, which explains the desire for black coaches. If Blacks don&rsquo;t like it they can always move to a predominantly black school where they&rsquo;d be more likely to get a black coach &amp; be taught by their own kind   &mdash;   assuming they don&rsquo;t mind the corresponding drop in academic standards.</p>
