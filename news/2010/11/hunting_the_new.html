			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"Baron Bodissey," Gates of Vienna, November 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In recent months the culturally enriched neighborhood of Rosengård in the southern Swedish city Malmö has been terrorized by a gunman who has been dubbed the &#8220;New Laserman&#8221; because he uses a rifle with a laser sight, in apparent imitation of a sniper who committed similar crimes a number of years ago.</p>
<p>Since all of the gunman&rsquo;s victims or intended victims have been immigrants  &mdash;  what else could they be in Rosengård?  &mdash;  &#8220;racism&#8221; is suspected as a motive for the shootings. Some people have gone so far as to associate the New Laserman with the Sweden Democrats.</p>
<p>The residents of Malmö are impatient to catch the killer. They don&rsquo;t want to wait for the police to arrest him, and plan to dispense some culturally enriched vigilante justice on the mean streets of Rosengård. In the news video below, the man known as the &#8220;Laser Turk&#8221; explains what he plans to do when he catches up with the culprit.</p>

						<p>
							<i>AFP (Stockholm), November 8, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Swedish police said yesterday that they had arrested a 38-year-old man suspected of murder and attempted killings in the southern city of Malmoe amid a manhunt for a possible immigrant-shooting sniper.</p>
<p>The man is suspected of one murder in October 2009 and seven attempted murders between then and October 2010, prosecutor Solveig Wollstad said during a press conference broadcast on public television.</p>
<p>Wollstad did not disclose the arrested suspect&rsquo;s name and refrained from officially linking him to a potential suspect Swedish press have dubbed &#8220;the new laserman&#8221;, who may be behind a series of immigrant shootings.</p>
<p>The man arrested possessed a licence for two weapons, which police seized during their search, inspector Boerje Stroemholm told reporters.</p>
<p>Wollstad said he &#8220;denies the crimes for which he is blamed&#8221;.</p>
<p>The arrest comes as a Malmoe police investigation announced on October 22 continues into whether a lone shooter with racist motives was behind some 15 attacks, killing one person and injuring many others.</p>
<p>The shooter may even have committed unsolved murders dating as far back as 2003, police said.</p>
<p>That announcement has spread panic in the southern city and the incidents bear a chilling similarity to the case of an immigrant-shooting sniper in Stockholm in the early 1990s dubbed &#8220;Laserman&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dozens of regional police officers have been dispatched to Malmoe to help in the hunt as of late October.</p>
<p>Authorities said at the time it might take weeks or months to find the author or authors of the attacks.</p>
<p>But at yesterday&rsquo;s press conference, Stroemholm refused to offer any details about the arrest, including how long the police had suspected him, or whether he was linked to suspected immigrant-targeted attacks.</p>
<p>He also would not comment on the possibility of other snipers linked to the attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The case is far from being resolved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The investigation has only just begun.&#8221;     He described the arrest as the result of traditional police work.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were interested in him following information obtained from the population,&#8221; he said of the suspect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laserman&#8221; was the nickname given to John Ausonius, who shot 11 people of immigrant origin, killing one, around Stockholm from August 1991 to January 1992.</p>
<p>Ausonius, who got his nickname by initially using a rifle equipped with a laser sight, was sentenced to life behind bars in 1994 and remains in prison.</p>
<p>Unlike Ausonius, the Malmoe shooter does not appear to use a laser sight rifle, but police say that the same gun has been used for several of the shootings, including the attack on the only known ethnic Swedish victim.</p>
<p>Trez Persson, 20, was killed last October when someone fired numerous shots into the car she was sitting in with a friend, a man of immigrant origin, who was seriously injured in the attack.</p>
<p>In October alone, numerous shootings appear linked to the case, including two men shot in the back, a week apart, as they waited alone in the dark at separate, isolated bus stops.<br>

		<p>The people who are going to die in Sweden as well as other White countries as a result of letting their countries be invaded by these people are going to total a very large number.  One can see how vengeful and violent these immigrants are.  If any poster here were to advocate violence or to condone the actions of whoever the shooter is, Amren probably wouldn&rsquo;t even allow the post.  But all in all, it&rsquo;s amazing how obliging and weak the Swedes are.  I mean, they&rsquo;re pathetic.  The only reason that they&rsquo;re not at the stage that the British are is because they&rsquo;re farther north.  And speaking of the British it won&rsquo;t be long before major violence erupts there.  And I guarantee you it will be those wonderful non-Whites initiating it.  Of course if the British (or any other White country) attempts to defend itself, then they will be labeled haters and racists.<br>

		<p>Having read this, I was thinking there was a laserman character in Sweden back in the 1980&rsquo;s around the time of the Olof Palme murder.</p>
<p>The only person he kills is an ethic Swedish woman.  That&rsquo;s just great.  This guy needs to be executed just for that alone.</p>
<p>That said, based on the above facts, I can state with firm conviction that the shooter did not graduate from any US Marine Corps boot camp, a la Charles Whitman or Lee Oswald.  The shooter is not a US Marine.  That should eliminate several hundred thousand suspects.</p>
<p>Just trying to help.</p>

		<p>After watching the interview with the immigrant, can anyone blame the shooter for being frustrated that this trash is allowed in his country?  Not only do they want to kill the shooter, torture him in the process, BUT HIS WHOLE FAMILY!  That&rsquo;s what we are in for with all these gangsters America allows in.  Are the Mexican or Russian gangs any different?  Wipe the whole family out.   THE STUPID GOVERNMENT keeps letting them in.  </p>

		<p>I agree with #1 &amp; #4, shameful to fire so many rounds and not kill an equal number of targets. I was in Baghdad during the infamous Blackwater shootings at the circle and the place was literally covered with spent brass and I thought what piss poor shooters these guys were. Not modestly, if I fire at 20 targets, 20 targets will be gone. NONE would have been a White woman, WELL maybe some would be. Believe this though, the muslims WILL retaliate soon.</p>

		<p>The arrested man has been identified by Swedish media as Peter Mangs. He is a loner, and suffers from Aspbergers syndrom according to himself. He is interested in weapons and belongs to a shooting club. He was there regarded as an accomplished shooter. He also has a great interest in music and played bass in several bands.</p>
<p>There is no information that he belongs to any political or racist group, but according to media he has made statements on the internet that could be interpreted as racist. He has also questioned whether Al-Qaida really was behind 9/11. His father has told media that after riots/incidents in the immigrant dominated neighborhood Rosengård (where the video with Laserturken above is filmed) he expressed worries that Sweden could become overrun by immigrants, </p>
<p>You can see photos of him in this video, some of them taken when he vacationated in the US with a friend. <a href="http://preview.tinyurl.com/petermangs" rel="nofollow">http://preview.tinyurl.com/petermangs</a></p>
<p>His father who originally is Finnish emigrated to the US several years ago, and Peter Mangs himself lived there for 3 years before moving back to Sweden.<br>

		<p>The woman &#8220;he&#8221; killed was the mattress of an albanian drug dealer and robber who had lost a 250 kilogram shipment of khat. It has all the hallmarks of a drug related crime. No major loss. The albanian survived and told his friends that there were several men present at the shooting. So no, this is unlikely to be the work of a single random gunman. It was likely the work of a bunch of angry somalis who had fronted the money for the khat shipment. </p>

		<p>Perhaps this guy sees himself as a one man partisan army defending his home country. </p>
<p>Or perhaps he thinks he has finally found a use for all the immigrants, cheap targets. </p>

		<p> What do they expect to happen when a country is invaded? Are we just going to sit down and let the invaders take over? Single men with nothing to lose will be the start but eventually whole groups will become involved in repelling the invaders. As economic times harden the pressure to be silent will just explode into violence.</p>

		<p>Like others, I find myself wondering how anyone with a laser sight could be such a lousy shot. A geek with Coke-bottle eyeglasses would get better results. I recently installed a laser on my handgun, and it definitely improves my accuracy. Of course, that&rsquo;s at the range   &mdash;   live targets are harder to hit, laser or no laser.</p>

		<p>The reason the Muslim immigrant in the video is so aggressive and boastful is because here in the UK &amp; in other EU member-states Muslims are allowed by the Marxist/globalist pro-EU governments to hold regular street demos and commit crimes, knowing full well they will be handled with kid-gloves by the police who are hamstrung by the politically-correct government and Common Purpose-trained senior police officers. We have all seen on the news and videos how they are mollycoddled in France, etc. And if a white assaults a minority he is charged with racism, but if the shoe is on the other foot a minority is seldom, if ever, charged with racism. Thus have Muslims become emboldened. Muslim youth are well aware that they are being given special treatment under the law. If these cowards (they always attack in gangs) had to face justice or face the wrath of the indigenous people then they wouldn&rsquo;t be half as cocky.</p>
<p>Emboldening Muslims is a deliberate tactic of the Marxist/globalist political elite, worried to death about the rise in nationalist parties throughout Europe (Ukraine being the latest to make nationalist electoral advances). The Marxist/globalist elite are at war with their own people and there is absolutely no doubt they are at present attempting here in the UK to engineer civil unrest in the streets as an excuse  for them to make a spectacular show of force on the streets (most certainly using the EU para-military force, and perhaps some false flag operation that will pin the blame on the legal democratic nationalist BNP) that they believe will give the brainwashed masses a strict warning not to vote for nationalist parties. Looks like we&rsquo;ve had one already as only today EU autocrat Van Rompuy said that nation-states are finished and it is a crime to want to go back to having independent nation-states. I&rsquo;ve got news for this useless, faceless Marxist/globalist bureaucrat. You ain&rsquo;t seen nothing yet you totalitarian destroyer of peoples and their nations. </p>
<p>What has happened to Europe under the Marxist/globalist multicultural EU Federal Superstate is a template for what will be coming to the USA, courtesy of the their Marxist/globalist ideological bedfellow, the Obama stooge. Don&rsquo;t be fooled.</p>

		<p>Consider for a moment how utterly odd the Western World (EU, USA) has become. It is losing its influence on world economic events even as its triumphalism in social/ethnic matters reaches new heights. When is this rubber band going to break?<br>
Riots all over Europe, depression looming in the USA, and ethnocentric cohesion is a thing of the past. The ethnocentrically united Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans are never criticised, which makes one wonder why ethnic modification is dished out continuously on the Western peoples by their own ruling classes. Worse yet, the ethnocentric nations are the ones who will lead the 21st century.<br>
I can only hope the ethnocentric advantage is imitated in the Western world. Again, how odd it is to see ostensibly capitalist nations forget how to pursue their own self-interest.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like he is thinking in terms of clans and tribes. So if one member of a clan commits a dereliction, the whole clan must pay!  Very  Middle Eastern. Tribal warfare.</p>
<p>Natural thinking for him, of course, but totally alien to us. He fails to realize that. </p>

<p>True enough. </p>
<p>Cultural Marxism has long since given up on a working class revolution. Instead, they use alienated minorities and third world immigrants in the same role that used to be reserved for &#8220;revolutionary workers,&#8221; i.e., as cannon fodder to be thrown against the middle class. The interesting thing is how much of the corporate managerial elite is in cahoots with them. By promoting globalization, both gain their goals: Cultural Marxists want internationalism, corporate elites want to reduce Western populaces to the level of demoralized, de-nationalized consumers and low wage workers. </p>
<p>The thing is, Western peoples have to realize how their own elites have betrayed them   &mdash;   and fight back!</p>

<p>I like, and agree with, every word of your post.  You are absolutely right.</p>
<p>We are in a perilous position, beseiged both from above and below, with few friends in high places.  Even our so-called &#8220;representatives&#8221; have been bought out and do not serve our interests but are in the pocket of others.  Virtually all the key institutions and choke points of our society and culture are by now under alien/minority domination.  </p>
<p>That our own people, history, and culture are being reviled in the schools is proof of this. That minorities are everywhere given prefenence in schools, government, and the workplace is further proof.</p>
<p>We are the &#8220;persecuted majority&#8221;. But many of us don&rsquo;t realize that.  They  naively assume that because they are still the (numerical) majority,  numbers mean power. Not so!  A confused, disorganized majority will always be at the mercy of a highly organized, disciplined, determined minority.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to put up with this.  But most of our people don&rsquo;t even know there&rsquo;s a war going on against them.   And that&rsquo;s how the &#8220;minorities&#8221; want to keep it.</p>
