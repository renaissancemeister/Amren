<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 15-year-old Harrisburg High School student was arrested Monday for allegedly carrying a loaded pistol at school and a 17-year-old was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly bringing a baseball bat to school Friday in what students and police are calling a feud between blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>Police aren&rsquo;t sure what sparked the disagreement, but some black students said they were harassed by a group of Hispanic students as they left school Friday, causing a 15-year-old to go home in tears. The students who were arrested were Hispanic, police said.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself. Hispanics will NEVER be on our side! They hate Whites as much as they hate blacks. Haven&rsquo;t you heard of all the racist things they say against White people and how they are going to take this country away from us &#8220;ole gringos&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Curie high school in Chicago has an elevated train stop nearby. Mexican students that are gangbangers wait at the stop with baseball bats waiting to &#8220;greet&#8221; the black students. The city school admin changed the school boundaries and did not take into account gang affiliations.</p>
<p>Mexican and black are each the tough guy on the block. Can be only one tough guy and both are competing for the same turf with bad consequences for all.</p>

		<p>Some latinos (those with affinity for gangbanging) absolutely worship blacks, rap music, sagging pants, etc.  I have seen this with my own eyes.  Funny thing is, the same latinos get scared and meek around giant bantus.</p>
<p>Other latinos (the majority) absolutely hate blacks and fear them, that&rsquo;s why the latinos will physically displace blacks anywhere they move into.</p>
<p>I truly believe the eventual dissolution of the country will be sparked by massive race riots between blacks and latinos, whose feuds will turn into open warfare leading to societal breakdown.</p>
<p>When that day comes, if I am around and have some influence, I will demand that all liberals, multi-culturalists and diversity advocates be denied (or stripped of) citizenship in the new majority white state and be forcibly deported to the new black and latino states permanently.</p>

		<p>Well, there&rsquo;s diversity you&rsquo;ve been aching for, you leftist loonies! Are you sure you can&rsquo;t find a &#8220;racist&#8221; white to blame for all this?</p>
<p>How about schools, surely building those was &#8220;oppressive&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221;, which causes the &#8220;minorities&#8221; to act this way.</p>
<p>Take it all in, God willing the sane American folks wont have to suffer it much longer.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Stanley Lawson, president of the Harrisburg Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he plans to meet with Hispanic leaders in the community this week to talk about what&rsquo;s happening at the high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just tell your blacks, Stanley, to stop trying to bully all other races.</p>
<p>Blacks are fighting with everybody from whites to mestizos to Asians.  Nobody fights them back but the mestizos.  </p>
<p>Anybody with any intelligence knows that fighting, intimidation and hassling just interferes with trying to get an education, and they usually try to avoid trouble.  But not blacks.  They perceive chaos is part of the curriculum, because most of them are too dumb to know better, and they can&rsquo;t compete academically anyhow.  A fair number of mestizos are like that also, but nowhere near the black percentage of troublemakers.</p>
<p>But the situation will change as conditions worsen.  Multiracialism is the concept of fools who live in a bubble of their own making and do not really understand reality.</p>
<p>They WILL understand it, however, when it comes upon them in the form of tribal separatism and they are the objects of beatings because of their race.</p>
<p>But, will they change afterwards?</p>
<p>Uh, uh.  They&rsquo;re just too far gone to be cured. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s seems there are only two possibilities with blacks. Either they live in terror, or they terrorize others. What&rsquo;s astonishing is how quickly they go from bullies to thumb-sucking crybabies whenever another race gets wise and deals with them in the only way they are capable of understanding. Looks like Hispanics are doing the work (white) Americans aren&rsquo;t allowed to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dealt with Hispanics for a very long time. They can be difficult, and it would suit me fine if they were living somewhere else&hellip; like the third world they came here from. On the whole they&rsquo;re not terribly intelligent, but generally they form gangs and such in response to aggression and perceived discrimination by others. Blacks, on the other hand, engage in random acts of violence and mayhem because it&rsquo;s part of who they are.</p>

		<p>Read the comments section, it&rsquo;s pathetic.  You have a student within feet of being able to put anyone within a 100yd radius at risk to a poorly placed pistol shot and you have parents arguing politics and a history of school administration corruption.</p>
<p>The only person there who makes sense is the one suggesting a return to &#8216;smaller schools&rsquo; with fewer kids in more realistically drawn up districts.  Which sounds to me like a not-so-closet plea for racial separation before blood gets spilled.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to start taking the perks out of public schooling as an incentive for unqualified AA applicants to &#8216;lay back sick, on the couch&rsquo; while armed thugs wander their halls.</p>
<p>And going enmasse to voucherism is the way to make that happen as a function of defunding.  So that the only little darlings left are those whom the cops can tag from an arrest photo before they zip up the body bags on what used to be a human life.</p>
<p>The only question is how we keep it cheap an ethnically cohesive enough that white neighborhoods can afford to host &#8216;ye olden one room school house&rsquo; with course selections that leverage our youth&rsquo;s intellects exclusively.  Restructured school years and massive online remote instruction along with computer driven subject saturation learning might be one way to go forward at less than the cost of new school building, in-neighborhood.</p>

		<p>Just another reason to either homeschool or put your kids in private school. Check out the racial demographics of the public school in your district and if it approaches 10% then get your kids out of there. There is no learning when minorities have control of a school.</p>

<p>All animals, insects, etc. compete for &#8220;turf&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<p>In this case, the turf  they&rsquo;re competing for has been vacated by Whitey.  It was once whitey&rsquo;s turf   &mdash;   not so long ago.  Whitey has fled. Where will he flee next?  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re preoccupied with each other right now. But don&rsquo;t rejoice.  When one of them has eliminated the other, they will  turn on Whitey next -  if any whites can still be found. </p>

<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Curie&#8221; high school.  What an irony!   I&rsquo;ll bet none of those blacks and hispanos have even the slightest idea where that name comes from or whom it commemorates.   Just irrelevant, dead old white folks, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised it still stands.   It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before it gets changed to either Martin Luther King or Cezar Chavez.  (The outcome of the gang wars will determine that.)</p>

<p>When you look at Chicago in the broader historical context, &#8220;Whitey&#8221; only occupied that turf for about a century and a half.  That tiny, brief span is merely a blip in the long annals of history.  Whites came and they went.  We did far more than anyone else, but we left it all to others. We abandoned it and fled; we did not stand and fight to keep what was ours. That wasn&rsquo;t OUR fault, I don&rsquo;t mean to imply, because our own government tied our hands and discriminated against us in every legal way possible. </p>
<p>Our hegemony didn&rsquo;t last long.  We didn&rsquo;t HAVE to lose it, but we did   &mdash;   all because of foolish, thoughtless, government policies (largely controlled by others)  that didn&rsquo;t have to be. We failed to learn anything from history, and so we were doomed to  repeat it.</p>
<p>About 1820, the whites replaced the Indians (who were busy - VERY busy! - replacing each other), and they were then soon replaced by the blacks who came pouring in within a century, to enjoy what whites had built. Those blacks are now being replaced by Mexicans.  </p>
<p>What demographic tidal wave is coming next?  Who will be the ultimate possessors?  I predict the Mexicans in their turn will go too. They will not last long. The fertile real estate of this country is too valuable to be left in the hands of a bunch of squabbling, disorganized gangbangers. Someone more organized, ruthless, and powerful will seize it. The Mexicans won&rsquo;t be able to stand up to them, and will get no mercy.</p>
<p>Well, so long, Chicago, you toddlin town!  It was great knowin&rsquo; you, while you lasted.  Good luck, whatever you become in the future. At any rate, it doesn&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;ll be white.</p>

<p>I agree. I don&rsquo;t believe the Latinos will be able to hold this country for very long. Another far more ruthless, agressive race in East Asia will be here before long. It should be interesting to see how blacks and latinos complain under Chinese overlords. So, they thought they had it bad under whitey? Well, they haven&rsquo;t seen ANYTHING yet!!!!</p>

		<p>I know a school in California that&rsquo;s 80 percent minority that has a violence rate of near zero and average test scores in the 96th percentile. Nearly all seniors have taken calculus and AP classes. This school is far higher achieving than most majority white schools. Anyone want to guess how that is? No, it&rsquo;s not lowered standards or affirmative action. It&rsquo;s a public school that is open to anyone who lives in the district. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious, google Monta Vista High School and Cupertino.</p>
<p>So much for the 10 percent minority rule. In fact, WHITES have moved out of Cupertino because they have trouble keeping up with the high standards Asian students set. </p>

<p>This is absolutely wrong.  Even now, America is a majority White country, and White Americans are STILL contributing to their own displacement by continuing to consent to an overtly anti-White governing establishment.  For at least the past 50 years, if not longer, White Americans have consented to and empowered a government that is hostile to their every interest.  This we can&rsquo;t blame on anyone but ourselves.</p>
<p>Voting in a &#8220;better government&#8221; is not the solution.  Your vote represents nothing but your consent to the government in power.  You need to withdraw that consent.  </p>
<p>The single most important thing to draw from the experience of losing our country is WE GAVE IT AWAY.  Nothing is forced upon you by a government that serves at your pleasure.  </p>

As of the 2006-2007 school year, Monta Vista has a student body of 2,450 students, of which 72% are Asian, 25% are White and 3% are Other (African American,Latino,Native American). 5% are limited English.</p>
<p>Wiki only has the 06 07 info.  I didn&rsquo;t see anything more current, but I doubt that your Calculus and AP mestizos raised &gt; 3% of that student population since 07.  Cupertino is full of Silicon-valley asians and liberal White elites.  Let&rsquo;s compare this to to what&rsquo;s in Oakland, shall we?  </p>

<p>No. Although whites may still be - numerically - the majority, you are making the mistake of assuming that the majority always rules. It does  not&hellip; not necessarily.  For those past 50 years, we have had a minority-run  society, operated largely for the benefit of minorities at the expense of the majority, and controlled by the Liberal-Minority Coalition (including many whites) who have profited handsomely from the arrangement. </p>
<p>America, our patrimony, has been put on sale. And the selling of America has been VERY profitable.  To a few, if not to us.</p>
<p>Through court decisions, laws, and the (legal) denial of real estate covenants, of our right of association, the jiggling of school boundaries, the imposition of quotas, whites have been left with no legal recourse to fight back. They have been blocked juridically at every turn.  The only option left them was white flight&hellip; which they did, across the country, by the millions, abandoning the great cities they had built.  </p>
<p>It was the government against the people  The people lost.</p>
<p>Obviously,  &#8220;the people&#8221; were not in control of their government.  Who was?   For the past half century, minority interests have ruled America (pretending to represent us).  Just because we are the majority does not mean we are in power!   If that were the case, illegal immigration would be zero. If that were the case, Affirmative Action would not exist. If that were the case,  blacks would be running Brazil today.   They don&rsquo;t!  And we don&rsquo;t run America either. We are the persecuted majority, but are allowed to think we are in charge.</p>
<p>Voting is part of the deception.  You can vote for the candidates they sift out and give you.  As you say, your vote is merely your ratification of the government in power. It usually comes down to a gruding  endorsement of the lesser of evils, not the ideal that we would like.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;For the past half century, minority interests have ruled America (pretending to represent us). Just because we are the majority does not mean we are in power! If that were the case, illegal immigration would be zero. If that were the case, Affirmative Action would not exist. If that were the case, blacks would be running Brazil today. They don&rsquo;t!&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
Absolutely. It should never be taken for granted.  If majority rule were an automatic thing, blacks would be running Brazil, and AIPAC would not be running the USA.  An organized, determined, well-funded  minority bloc will always prevail over a confused, disunited, clueless majority. And that&rsquo;s why we have so many policies in place that work against the American majority. In short, numbers aren&rsquo;t everything!</p>
<p>I imagine that people who are accustomed to running things as a minority have no trepidations about the coming &#8220;minority-hood&#8221; of whites in the US.  For them, it will be just business as usual, with some small adjustments to deal with a new majority.</p>
