<p><span style="COLOR: black">Pretty clear, </span><span style="COLOR: black">isn&rsquo;t </span><span style="COLOR: black">it? If any whites anywhere permit themselves the vagrant thought that it might be nice to </span>remain a majority<span style="COLOR: black"> in North America or Europe, or if it dawns on them that to </span><b>&#8220;celebrate diversity&#8221;</b><span style="COLOR: black"> is to celebrate their dispossession, they are <b>&#8220;evil&#8221;</b>. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">Well, I guess I&rsquo;m <b>&#8220;evil&#8221;</b> by Dr. Steele&rsquo;s standards. And, dear reader, you probably are, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">Nowadays, all a </span>white person needs to do is attend a Tea Party,<span style="COLOR: black"> and the </span>NAACP will call him <b>&#8220;racist&#8221;</b>.<span style="COLOR: black"> Even voting Republican can be a form of moral leprosy. </span><b>&#8220;Anti-racist&#8221;</b><span style="COLOR: black"> entrepreneur </span>Tim Wise,<span style="COLOR: black"> [</span><a href="mailto:timwise@timwise.org">Email him</a><span style="COLOR: black">] who hectors whites about their sins </span><a href="https://www.speakoutnow.org/userdata_display.php?modin=50&amp;uid=156">at $6,000 a day</a><span style="COLOR: black">, recently </span>unbosomed his joy<span style="COLOR: black"> at the thought of the deaths of millions of us.

<p><span style="COLOR: black">Mr. Wise repented of his candor and </span><a href="https://delightsome.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/tim-wise-tries-to-edit-his-hate">removed that passage from his website</a><span style="COLOR: black">. But it&rsquo;s edifying to know where we stand. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">The </span>Southern Poverty Law Center<span style="COLOR: black"> is constantly on the sniff for <b>&#8220;hate&#8221;</b>, so I thought I would call Mr. Wise to its attention. My good friend at the center, </span><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/who-we-are/staff/heidi-beirich-phd">Heidi Beirich,</a><span style="COLOR: black"> [</span><a href="mailto:hbeirich@splcenter.org">Email her</a><span style="COLOR: black">] is a </span>world-class hate sniffer.<span style="COLOR: black"> She&nbsp;assured me that Mr. Wise&rsquo;s calling me and millions of whites sons of whores, telling us to go to hell, and thrilling at the thought of our deaths </span>does not qualify as <b>&#8220;hate&#8221;</b>.<span style="COLOR: black"> I&rsquo;m greatly relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">I&rsquo;m also perplexed, though, because </span><a href="https://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/002485.html">Dr. Beirich</a><span style="COLOR: black"> thinks my publication <i>American Renaissance</i> peddles &#8220;<b>hate&#8221;</b>  &mdash;  and that </span>VDARE.COM does, too.<span style="COLOR: black"> </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">In fact, anyone who wants whites and their culture to survive, and who thinks they are not interchangeable with any other people or cultures is apparently a hater. Anyone who likes being white or  &mdash;  heaven help us  &mdash;  hopes his </span>grandchildren<span style="COLOR: black"> will be white is too awful for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">Dr. Steele, Dr. Beirich, and Mr. Wise will no doubt be outraged to know that we <b>&#8220;haters&#8221;</b> get together from time to time to discuss such shocking questions. <i>American Renaissance</i> is holding its next conference over the weekend of Feb. 4- 6 in </span><a href="/news/2004/02/20/charlotteseg.html">Charlotte, North Carolina</a><span style="COLOR: black">, and I invite all VDARE.COM readers to attend. If you are a dissenter from </span>racial orthodoxy<span style="COLOR: black"> you will have a marvelous time.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">Full details are </span><a href="/conference/2011.html"><i>here</i></a><i><span style="COLOR: black">.</span></i><span style="COLOR: black"> We will have some great speakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">There will be a mystery guest from Europe, who represents the very best of nationalist political movements. He (or she) is a prominent figure in just the kind of party we must have in this country if we are not to go extinct, as Mr. Wise so ardently wishes. This speaker seldom comes to the United States, and the </span>American Renaissance conference<span style="COLOR: black"> will be a rare and inspiring chance to hear about what works across the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">Our speaker from South Africa, </span><a href="/news/2005/03/help_dan_roodt.html">Dan Roodt</a><span style="COLOR: black">, is an </span>Afrikaner<span style="COLOR: black"> leader whose </span>people<span style="COLOR: black"> face a far sharper crisis than our own. He will offer a riveting analysis of the psychology of capitulation, and how to avoid it.</span></p>
<p>Jonathan Bowden,<span style="COLOR: black"> little known in the United States, has a tremendous following in British nationalist circles. I do not believe I have ever heard so powerful and mesmerizing a speaker anywhere. He will share a </span>British nationalist&rsquo;s<span style="COLOR: black"> perspective on America.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">Donald Thomas is one of the few people who really understand how the American </span>refugee/asylum<span style="COLOR: black"> program works. Like so many things the government does, the deeper you probe the worse the rot. His report will shock you.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">Hugh Kennedy, an expert on </span>free speech law,<span style="COLOR: black"> will talk about where thinking of the Shelby Steele kind ultimately leads: censorship. After all, if </span><a href="https://volokh.com/2010/01/22/buchana/">whites</a><span style="COLOR: black"> with a sense of their </span>group interests<span style="COLOR: black"> are a <b>&#8220;grave evil&#8221;</b>, it is only a matter of prudence to curtail their rights of speech and </span>assembly<span style="COLOR: black">. Mr. Kennedy will explain the ways the First Amendment could be neutered.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">Other speakers include </span>David Yeagley,<span style="COLOR: black"> who will offer <b>&#8220;A Comanche View of White America&#8221;</b>, and Prof. </span>Raymond Wolters<span style="COLOR: black"> of the University of Delaware, who will describe the desperate folly to which the </span>racial gap in school achievement<span style="COLOR: black"> has driven our <b>&#8220;</b></span><b>educators</b><b><span style="COLOR: black">&#8221;.</span></b><span style="COLOR: black"></span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">As usual, there will be remarks by your servant and the incomparable </span><a href="/conference/2008/2008_sam_dickson.html">Sam Dickson,</a><span style="COLOR: black"> and we will have yet another mystery guest, an American academic who, in his retirement, is finally free to speak his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">I would note </span>that in this sweet land of liberty<span style="COLOR: black">, there are so many people of the Steele-Wise-Beirich persuasion that we have to be coy about the exact location of the conference. We know that if we give the </span><a href="https://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/015715.html">lovers of tolerance and diversity</a><span style="COLOR: black"> enough time to organize, they will put </span><a href="https://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/015684.html">pressure</a><span style="COLOR: black"> on the venue to cancel their contract with us. Our venue is fully briefed and believes in freedom of speech. But just to be on the safe side, we are releasing the final location just a few days before the conference begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">In the meantime please make your plans to drive or fly to Charlotte. Roundtrip tickets are cheaper than you think: If you book now, they are under $200 from New York and under $300 from Los Angeles or Dallas.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">And when you come, be on the sniff for <b>&#8220;</b></span><b>hate</b><b><span style="COLOR: black">&#8221;</span></b><span style="COLOR: black">, will you, and let me know if you find any.</span></p><i><span style="COLOR: rgb(165,0,33)">For details of American Renaissance&rsquo;s ninth conference, Feb. 4-6 2011, click</span><span style="COLOR: black"> </span></i><a href="/conference/2011.html"><i>here</i></a>

Until the racial gap in school achievement ceases to exist, and it seems to be getting wider, The Bell Curve deserves the benefit of the doubt.  </p>

		<p>I think I will venture out of my &#8220;fortress&#8221; in the North Carolina mountains to attend this convention. I hope I will learn that something is being accomplished positively for whites somewhere, rather than just hear talk about how bad the situation is everywhere.</p>
<p>I personally think that no progress can be made until the  term &#8220;white racist&#8221; becomes a desired and sought after title.</p>

		<p>Dr. Steele&rsquo;s comments have been taken out of context. He was making a commentary on how white guilt has effectively prevented whites from having a collective identity, and that today&rsquo;s societal mores condemn white collective identity as evil&hellip; NOT saying that he personally finds it evil for whites to have a collective identity.</p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor has grown to see appreciate seeing himself as an iconoclast (as only men on a mission can do) but I hope they keep the &#8216;bad&rsquo; and negative racism to a minimum at the conference. That would really piss off the Tim Wise types.</p>

		<p> So far, so good. Mr. Taylor and the others planning the conference are learning from their previous mistakes that secrecy, for as long as possible, is an absolute necessity. Otherwise, the enemies of racial realism will try to invoke the &#8220;hate-speech veto&#8221; either at the venue where the conference is to be held, or at the hotels-motels where those in attendance are planning to stay.</p>
<p> Keep in mind, also, that if at all possible, written contracts with those lodging places should be insisted on. If they know that canceling out at the last minute will get our hands deeply into their pockets, they&rsquo;ll be much less likely to knuckle under to the anti-free speech thugs who will try to disrupt or prevent the conference if they possibly can.</p>
<p> Please don&rsquo;t let the same thing happen this time that happened in 2009 (I think that was the year). And those in attendance should keep in mind that, assuming the conference goes forward, they may have to be prepared to defend themselves from hostile picketers, etc. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we should start trouble. But it&rsquo;s been pretty obvious that local police won&rsquo;t do much to assure that free speech is not disrupted.</p>

		<p>I hope that the folks who are charged with watching over the legal details of the conference have reviewed (w/o tipping a hand) the official policy of record regarding the private hiring of off duty Charlotte-Mecklenburg PD officers to cover the venue for the duration of the conference.

		<p>I second Victoria&rsquo;s comments above. I find much of what Dr. Steele says to be in harmony with the sentiment of this website.</p>
<p>A better example of a renowned and award-winning black scholar who openly spews vile hatred of European Americans is Amiri Baraka, who teaches that all white women deserve to be raped. Baraka was rewarded for promoting sexual assault with a $10,000 government stipend when he was named Poet Laureate of New Jersey. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been honored with felloships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation Award for Drama, and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p>

		<p>I attended this conference in 2006.  It was a wonderful experience. There is nothing like being around 300 strangers who think just like you do on issues that can get you fired. It is the most wonderful bonding time you will ever have with other whites. But I must say, it was also very intimidating and a little scary at times for obvious reasons.  I have been trying to muster the courage to go again.</p>
<p>Anonymous girl, no you won&rsquo;t be the only girl.  When I went there were quite a few females but we were still in the minority.  And we also got a lot of attention. Email me if you have questions. </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind meeting many of the regular posters on here in person.  I guess if enough of you say you are going, I MAY consider it.</p>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t AmRen hold its conference on the private property of a wealthy benefactor? </p>
<p>I am sure there are a few wealthy White people, who either belong to such organizations as the Council of Conservative Citizens, or at least support what they believe in, and would be in a position to accomodate the AmRen Conference. </p>
<p>Normally, these wealthy people have considerable sway with the local Police and Sheriff&rsquo;s Departments, as well as have their own private Security personnel, to ensure that the guests and Speakers are not harassed, while in attendance. </p>

I don&rsquo;t think you need worry.  And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be extra welcome.  There were women at the last conference (though not a lot), and even family groups, including one young couple with a tiny baby. Relax!</p>

		<p>&#8220;I hope the folks charged with  the legal details of the conference have reviewed (w/o tipping a hand) the official policy regarding the private hiring of off duty Charlotte-Mecklenburg PD officers to cover the venue for the duration of the conference. The Chief is not our friend.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Charlotte if 33% black, with a black police chief. <br>
I would guess that off-duty Charlotte police officers would not be available for this conference.  Not if they like their regular jobs. I would look elsewhere for security (if such security is necessary). Can&rsquo;t the hotel provide its own security?</p>

		<p>&#8220;So far, so good. Mr. Taylor and the others planning the conference are learning from their previous mistakes that secrecy, for as long as possible, is an absolute necessity.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The TRUTH shall set you free! But not if Liberal Leftwingers can prevent it. That differeces among races go far beyond physical features and skin pigmentation is not a truth acceptable to liberals. That if all races had in reality been equal to each other   &mdash;   there would have been near identical progress through the ages. The difference between groups, in learning, knowledge, development and progress   &mdash;   would have been measurable in decades. Not in centuries, much less thousands of years as with Whites and Black African people.</p>
<p>It is the bleak reality (to liberals) that those gross differences in rate of progress and development existed, that fuels the foam-at-the-mouth outrage of liberals.</p>

		<p>Anonymous Girl   &mdash;   I hope to attend especially as it is within easy driving distance.  The gender thing doesn&rsquo;t bother me, but being a lone attendee among &#8220;groups&#8221; would be awkward. I would guess/hope a fair amount of the attendees are there by themselves and the networking events are set up to make everyone feel comfortable.</p>

		<p>I wish I could come, but Africa is a bit far from you and it is costly. I do find the secrecy thing quite intriguing; I remember of course what happened to your last conference but I still find it strange given how openly we would have done it here.</p>
<p>I never agreed with the old AWB rhetoric but did attend a speech by the slain Eugene Terreblanche in Pretoria once, swastika style flags everywhere and the hall rented from the ANC municipality or provincial legislator, and there(America) where whites do form a majority you have to plan secretly. Many off you ask when will it change and I think there is something to being a minority that sparks a kind of spiritual reaction or awakening and when you become the minority it will be the same. If the left was thinking that they will destroy the right by making whites a minority they misunderstood &#8220;diversity&#8221; and its true effects.</p>
<p>The right wing in America has not even been borne yet, but when it comes it is going to be magnificent. Good luck to all off you and if you are a white American do attend this conference you will not be disappointed, your grandchildren might even someday be &#8220;wowed&#8221; by the fact that you where such a visionary!</p>
<p>Godspeed</p>

		<p>I agree with the poster above who suggested that Amren try holding these venues on private property. Also, instead of announcing where it will be held two days prior, why not just send everyone who wants to attend, that information only?</p>
<p>I am glad that unlike the 2006 conference I attended in DC, that Amren is considering a less threatening location this time. I am a person who gets nervous real easily, and while the conference I attended in &#8216;06 was a blessing for me, it was also quite scary for me at times.</p>
<p>Also, I have noticed a lot of single females on here announcing they are going.  I don&rsquo;t want to make anybody uncomfortable, but for those of you who ARE female, feel free to email me, and we can start an email discussion about rooming situations. When I went by myself in &#8216;06 as a very young professional right out of college, I found the room situation expensive. </p>
<p>If I do decide to go, and I am STILL not really sure, maybe some of us females could discuss rooming together after getting to know each other. And I know that if I had &#8220;friends&#8221; ahead of time going into this, it might ease some of my anxieties I had last time.</p>
<p>I will also say that Amren makes you wear a name tag around the hotel that basically advertises that you are there with Amren.  Aside from my other fears, it was quite intimidating going down to the lobby by myself for dinner etc&hellip; wearing it, as a good number of people who I ran into in the elevator as well as in the lobby were most certainly NOT &#8220;with us&#8221;.  I also got many looks of death from the blacks who worked in the hotel as staff.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;[B]eyond an identity that apologizes for white supremacy, absolutely no white identity is permissible. In fact, if there is a white racial identity today it would have to be white guilt &mdash; a shared, even unifying, lack of racial moral authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you read this statement in its context, Shelby Steele is merely REPORTING what he perceives to be the present attitude of whites and others toward white racial identity, and his entire book in which the quote appears, &#8220;White Guilt,&#8221; is a lament rather than a celebration of some of the negative effects of the passing of white supremacy. On the same page as the quote above, Steele writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;But the death of white authority also meant that something culturally enormous  &mdash;  something that had brought great cohesion and coherence to society  &mdash;  began to go out of the world. If white Western societies were racist and imperialistic, they were also the centers of an indisputably great civilization (one that absorbed contributions from many other races and cultures). But when white supremacy was delegitimized, whites did not simply lose the authority to practice racism. The loss of white authority generalized well beyond that, so that whites also lost a degree of their authority to stand proudly for the values and ideas that had made the West a great civilization despite its many evils.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course Steele doesn&rsquo;t lament the defeat of white supremacy per se (&#8220;It was a good thing and overdue to boot&#8221;)&hellip;.he&rsquo;s black after all!&hellip;but his entire book is an analysis of the vacuum of moral authority that that defeat produced, and how that vacuum was filled by race hustling (affirmative action, etc) and by white toadying to race hustling, which in his opinion worked to the detriment of both races and to our society.</p>
<p>I disagree with Steele&rsquo;s underlying assumptions of racial equality and some other matters, but his DESCRIPTION and ANALYSIS of the results of the passing of moral authority out of white hands is in my opinion brilliant. &#8220;White Guilt&#8221; is a short, easy, and pleasant read, and I recommend it very strongly. It&rsquo;s increased my racial and other understandings immensely. I regret if Jared&rsquo;s manner of introducing some excerpts may give an erroneous idea of how worthwhile the book is.</p>
<p>The quotes above are from pp. 108-109 of the Harper Perennial paperback, 2006.</p>

		<p>An aspect of  AMERICAN Renaissance is the question of why such<br>
a rebirth would have to be linked (that word!) in any way<br>
to the political or geophysical future of the nation known for<br>
more than two centuries as the United States of America.  As classical Greece and Rome have had rebirth in America, our<br>
civilization might well have a future in,say, China. The larger<br>
and vital issue is that in a planet getting smothered with humans,it is less important whether in an irreversibly global world those who surmount to be the cultural custodians and propagators are more similar to present day Chinese or present day Anglo-Americans than it is that some viable group so surmount and the planet not sink into gray sameness.  AR seems not to confront this issue directly&hellip;yet. </p>

		<p>I attended the AmRen 2008 conference in Virgina, and the staff at the hotel was pleasant enough.  I didn&rsquo;t get the evil eye from any of them.  What I detected was more a look of curiosity.  Outside the conference rooms, I removed my name tag and wandered freely into the bar and restaurant.  I made sure to treat the staff with respect, and to tip appropriately. I have worked in the hospitality industry, and I can say that everyone - and I mean *everyone* - knows that not everyone tips the same if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Attendance last time was about 10% female, a fact which I hope does not dissuade women from attending the conference in February.  All the men were, of course, dressed in suits and ties.  It was a classy event. It probably does not need to be said, but here goes: I did not observe or even hear about any unruly or boorish behavior.  </p>
<p>Before attending, I had known only one person (Jared), although I was familiar with most of the speakers through their scholarship and published works. Meeting people was not at all difficult or uncomfortable.  </p>
<p>I will try to make it, but sometimes my schedule is dictated by my work so I might not be able to.  If you enjoy reading AmRen.com, then you will love the conference. </p>

<p>At conferences it is customary to require that attendees wear their name tags when they are in the meeting or show areas in order to identify them as participants. I will assume this hotel is open to the public and open to non-Amren guests which means you certainly don&rsquo;t have to display your name tag in the public areas unless you want to.</p>

<p>I agree with you! I shudder when I see a White apologize for  something he/she said as being &#8220;insensitive&#8221; to people of color! ALL races are &#8220;racist&#8221;. It is only Whites who have been brainwashed into believing it is something evil and sinful (but only Whites are &#8220;guilty&#8221; of it) and they need to run away from that label as fast as they can. The fools just went over that cliff.</p>

		<p>Does AmRen have a charter or mission statement which they can put up at the entrance to the meeting rooms, delineating what they are about or would it make a difference to the raging mobs?

		<p>I most certainly didn&rsquo;t mean to alarm anyone with my post.  If I did, I apologize.  It really is a great experience, for sure. Last time I went was also my first, and as I said, I get nervous easily, and to my credit, I think the one in &#8216;06 may have had a little more drama than other ones.</p>
<p>Sonya, I think you are right about the name tags.  But for some reason at the conference I went to I noticed everyone wearing them once they stepped out of their rooms and went in the halls, so I felt like I had to do the same, I guess.</p>
<p>But if I may make a suggestion ( I promise, that this one won&rsquo;t come out of fear), I think Amren should designate a room off to the side for those of us who post on Amren to meet each other during free time. I so much wanted them to do this at the last conference. Maybe everyone can make their own name tag for the mini-event, based on what they call themselves on the website.</p>

<p>I think I would just display my first name along with my screen name for the entire conference&hellip;in this day of googling I&rsquo;m not ready to broadcast my full name at a white nationalist conference! My hat is off to those brave enough to do so!</p>
<p>I attended the last &#8220;cancelled&#8221; conference, which evolved into just a much-reduced conference, and I had a very good time. The cream of the cream seemed to be there from the white nationalist community&hellip;it was a relaxing experience being in a gathering where I felt like one of the least knowledgeable people there..almost every conversation I initiated turned out to be a surprise: (&#8220;Well, yes, but another consideration is&hellip;&#8221;). Lol! It was such a pleasure to talk to so many intelligent people.</p>
<p>If I attend this coming conference, I&rsquo;m not going to attend expecting necessarily a smooth ride (though I&rsquo;m hoping). Certainly (?) at least one of our enemies will buy a ticket, receive the location information at the same time the rest of us do, and have made preparations to stage a phone blitz against the hotel at the last minute. Hm, but &#8220;the last minute&#8221; part might save the day. Yes, I think it will in fact&hellip;I think it takes a few days usually for that sort of campaign to achieve results.</p>
<p>If I can attend this time, I&rsquo;ll look forward to meeting lots of you.</p>

<p>At the one in &#8216;06, women wore business casual or what I would refer to as church attire. The younger women wore stylish skirts with nice tops and the older women wore nice pants with nice sweaters, or church attire.  I guess you get the general idea.</p>
<p>I was a late comer to the one in &#8216;06 and didn&rsquo;t get the memo about the nice attire.  Maybe that is another reason I got a little intimidated. Thank goodness I had a pair of slacks that were nice enough. But this time I would like to wear skirts, if I go. I think those are more fun anyways.</p>

		<p>Dr. Shelby Steele is to be commended for having the courage to speak the truth; and for stating this long-known double standard.  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll never get a job in the media; and if he is ever able to set foot in Stanford University again, I will be surprised.</p>
<p>My observations have been consistent with his claims about white people.  A White person is always free to celebrate the heritage of his or her, so long as it is identified by ethnic background.  You are free to put on a dance costume and perform a dance of a given nationality; be it Irish, German, Ukrainian, Polish, Hungarian, Serbian, Swedish, Italian&hellip;whatever.  You can even sing some songs which may be customary to a specific European nation.</p>
<p>But you must never&hellip;ever&hellip;express any pride whatsoever in regards to your race.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1968, singer James Brown reached Billboard&rsquo;s Top Ten with &#8220;Say It Loud - I&rsquo;m Black and I&rsquo;m Proud&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any White artist or singer, be it Eric Clapton or teen hearthrob Justin Bieber, would find his recording pulled from the market - without hesitation - if he expressed any lyric even resembling a statement of being White and proud at the same time.</p>
<p>Such a recording would be deemed contraversial at best; and an incitement of racial superiority at its worst.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>In regards to the scheduled Amren Conference, I have no plans to attend; but as a racially-aware Canadian, I do wish all the best to those who do and want to, whether you are able to attend or not.<br>

<p>Have you been to a conference?  The one I went to had rooms off to the side across from the conference room that were just there anyways. Some of us congregated in them after the banquet to talk randomly, but we were ushered out after a certain amount of time. </p>
<p>Also, I am not requesting for Amren to spend a lot of money. We can just congregate in the main conference room during break time after others file out for all I care, or at the bar. It would just be neat if someone suggested a place and time.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind being in charge.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t that easy to spot people who posted on the website, as most people used their regular legal names on name tags. People were very friendly, but it was only after getting to know people that I found out whether or not they posted on the website, and most of them didn&rsquo;t post regularly enough to know who I was (I was already a regular poster at the time).  In fact, just about all of the people I talked to seemed less interested in the matter than I was.</p>
<p>In regards to the tone of your post, no wonder arguments and in-fighting abrupt so easily on this website. I thought my post was a nice suggestion, and it is not as if I was demanding Amren to pay up extra money,  so I don&rsquo;t understand why you reacted the way you did. I understand that I am just as guilty as anybody when it comes to this sort of thing, but can we all just seriously calm down and not get mad at each other so easily over silly stuff?  Sometimes I feel like no matter what I say on here, even if it is nice and helpful, there are people who feel the need to react negatively. And I know there are other posters who go through this too, so I am not trying to play victim. All of us, including myself, need to calm down a little.</p>

<p>Yes. That is perfectly consonant with Marxist ideology. So that&rsquo;s allowed.   Culture and language are considered &#8220;Good&#8221;.  Race and genetics are &#8220;Bad&#8221;. Simple as that.  You can do anything in the name of &#8220;culture&#8221;, but nothing is allowed in the name of race.</p>
<p>I remember when the Communist Party used to have its bookstore on Lower Broaway, in New York, then later on 23rd St.  &mdash;   both of them beautiful stores, with couches and chairs to read and relax. You could just go in and sit; nobody hassled you.  (It was of course, subsidized by the Soviet Union.)  I used to drop in occasionally to look at the beautifully made, lavishly illustrated, magazines and other propaganda literature.  They were full of pictures of colorful folk festivals and such, all emphasizing how happy and race-free was Soviet Society. A paradise without any racial or ethnic animosity at all!   </p>
<p>That was shortly before the Sov.Union fell apart and all the ethnicities started going after one another (as they always did down through history). And then Yugovlavia fell too.  So much for the Marxist myth!</p>
<p>But the Sov. Union, and Yusoslavia, (and even the Turkish Empire) all held together so long as a ruthless central dictatorship held them together with force.  (One could even say that of Iraq under Saddam Hussein.) That seems to be the only way.</p>

 &#8220;Will you make video/audio of this available? <br>
CDs, downloads, whatever? Would be very useful for those who can not show up in person.&#8221; <br>

<p>Audio might be acceptable. I cannot speak for others, but I can understand that some attendees might feel uncomfortable with being photographed - given the hostile attitude of our government, and the unpopularity of our cause.  We are doing nothing illegal, and shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to worry about, ideally that is;  but even so, people do have jobs and positions to protect  and families to feed. They have reason to be concerned.  (For myself, I am independent and I personally don&rsquo;t care;  they can film me all they want.)</p>
<p>I recall a District Attorney (?) from Hornell(?) or Salamanca in NY State who was fired several years ago after attending such a conference.  No doubt others here remember that story. There was political pressure aplied from above (through Sen. Schumer, I believe) after the ADL called attention to him. And whether the conference was legal or not, and regardless of his constitutional rights to Freedom of Assembly,  he was fired anyway. (I wonder whatever became of that fellow. It would be nice if Amren could follow up on stories like these.)  No matter your rights, our government doesn&rsquo;t always behave legally. It will be worse now with Obama and Holder. </p>

<p>Lol! I reckon not! :) </p>
<p>Courtney, actually I think your idea of posters having an opportunity to meet is a very good one, and you would probably be a logical choice to take responsibility for it if you&rsquo;re willing&hellip;thanks. (It just made me laugh when I saw the sentence you&rsquo;d written! :)</p>
<p>I agree with you that it&rsquo;s not very evident who&rsquo;s a poster and who&rsquo;s not, at the mini-conference I attended (the &#8220;cancelled&#8221; one), so having a formally designated time and place would be helpful. The sooner in the conference, the better, probably, because then we would know who each other are for the rest of the conference.</p>
<p>Building community (ah, how easily phrases like that roll out of me after decades spent on the left) is a huge thing that we should be about, and too often aren&rsquo;t, so I appreciate your pressing the point and I appreciate the feeling behind it.</p>
<p>It may feel a little awkward, like those kids required to eat at designated tables in the lunch room, but it&rsquo;s still a good idea. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t turn into a food fight!</p>

<p>Thanks!  I am still deciding as to whether or not I should go.  Again, if I hear from enough posters who are thinking about it, I will probably consider it. :)</p>
