<h1>Jury Finds Kennesaw State Student Colotl Guilty On One of Two Charges</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andria Simmons, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Nov. 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Kennesaw State University student whose arrest and near deportation prompted a statewide debate about illegal immigration may be headed back to jail, if only for a few hours.</p>
<p>A Cobb County jury on Thursday found Jessica Colotl, 22, guilty on a charge of driving with no license. A conviction on the misdemeanor charge requires a mandatory minimum sentence of 48 hours in jail, with credit for time served. Colotl has already spent 45.5 hours in the Cobb County clink as a result of her March 30 arrest, so she would have to serve a minimum of 2 and a half hours. The maximum penalty under the law is 12 months in jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t agree with the verdict, but I have to go along with what they reached,&#8221; Colotl said after the trial ended.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jerome Lee, Colotl&rsquo;s attorney, said his client should have been found not guilty of driving without a license because she recently obtained a learner&rsquo;s permit. State law says that a person facing a charge of driving with no license shall be found not guilty if they show up to court with a driver&rsquo;s license in hand.</p>
<p>Cobb County Assistant Solicitor Rachel Bearman successfully argued that a learner&rsquo;s permit does not suffice as a driver&rsquo;s license under the law. She questioned whether the permit was valid, telling the judge &#8220;they have to lay a foundation for that, and the only person who could say that is the Department of Driver Services.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kennesaw State University Police Sgt. Kevin Kimsey testified that after he stopped Colotl, she fished around in her vehicle&rsquo;s center console and glove box as if looking for a license. She was &#8220;adamant&#8221; that she had a Mexican driver&rsquo;s license, but told the officer she might have left it in another purse, Kimsey said. He gave her until the following day at noon to show up at the police station with the license.</p>
<p>Colotl showed up at 11:55 a.m., saying she still couldn&rsquo;t find it. Her attorneys later conceded that she never had one.</p>
<p>Colotl was jailed and then handed over to the custody of federal immigration officers as part of a local-federal partnership called 287(g), which allows Cobb County deputies to check the immigration status of inmates. But after 37 days of being held in several immigration detention centers, Colotl was granted a yearlong deportation deferment to finish her studies.</p>
<p>Colotl said she is on track to graduate next spring with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in political science and a minor in French.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is still up in the air, but something positive will happen and I will get to stay here,&#8221; Colotl said.</p>
<p>Colotl, a native of Mexico whose parents brought her into the country as a child, considers herself and others like her to be &#8220;Americans without papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hank McCue, a curious Cobb County resident who attended the trial, said Colotl should have to followed the rules to emigrate legally like his own parents did in 1929.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real question is, what are we doing here?&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;We are paying jurors and we have a judge sitting here and we are spending all this time. She is an illegal immigrant.&#8221;</p>

		<p>1.  America has no need of new political science or law majors till, let&rsquo;s say the year 2100. Legal or illegal students, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. If there are illegal Russian or Chinese engineering students here, I&rsquo;d give them a hearing and consider their application.</p>
<p>2.  She demonstrated that she is an idiot let alone an unwelcome and illegal Mexican, by her statements and actions. We need to deport as they used to say, &#8220;mental defectives&#8221; as well as technically illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>3. It&rsquo;s amazing how the English language used to describe persons and objects so accurately, i.e., retarded, defective, moron, but now is prohibited by PC media and professors from doing so.</p>

		<p>If you saw the &#8220;on the street&#8221; interviews at the end of the clip, the only guy who implied that racism was at work was the Black guy. They&rsquo;re pro anything that furthers the agenda against  White people who built this country and support all these people with our sweat and  and who now are being marginalized by our own government in favor of these &#8220;interlopers&#8221; to quote the Irreverend Al Sharpton when referring to the White owners of Freddy&rsquo;s Fashion Mart in Harlem.</p>
<p>Now according to news reports we are facing the possibilty of a Cholera outbreak here; another alien killer being brought to our shores by the refugees from Haiti where the disease has already taken out 700 people.</p>

______</p>
<p>With more them 400,000 American STEM professionals out of work, why would you? </p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t need any more stinking H-1b&rsquo;s either.<br>

		<p>To Anon. #3: I am skeptical about most US born college students.They have attended the worst school system in the advanced world, and the colleges dread to give anyone who drags their body into class, or online in the increasing online curricula, anything less than a B.</p>
<p>Assume as you do that our STEM unemployeds are out of work and are competent to invent, design or evaluate products of value, the problem is the economy here dragged down by debt, excessive govt and thus resources devoted to hiring govt employees with few skills and high salaries and benefits, and massive imports because Presidents from Nixon to Obama all have shipped manufacuturing, and thus many engineering and blue collar jobs overseas.  </p>
<p>Cut the Feds down to a modest military that defends only our borders and coasts, eliminate all income taxes, cut off the colleges that don&rsquo;t produce professionals who we need and who can actually do something besides create paperwork, get the feds out of all healthcare and insurance, eliminate the EPA and NOAA,shut down the SEC, FCC, Fannie/Freddie and the &#8220;consumer&#8221; regulators Obama just rammed into being, send the EEOC to Nairobi to investigate why his talented father died in a gutter forgotten by all,and ban all immigation laws to permit only highly skilled selected talent who will have to be like old school immigrants: Red White and Blue and return to the Old Country if necessary as in the two World Wars to kill their relatives.</p>
<p>The US can always use more good, talented people. We&rsquo;ve admitted damn few of those since LBJ&rsquo;s Third World Immigrant Welcome Act of 1965.</p>
