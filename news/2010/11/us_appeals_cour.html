<h1>US Appeals Court in Philadelphia Hears Latest Arguments Over Mumia Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s Sentencing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maryclaire Dale, Canadian Press, Nov. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police widows and supporters of death-row activist Mumia Abu-Jamal listened Tuesday as federal appeals judges debated whether the former Black Panther deserves a new sentencing hearing in a police officer&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The appeals court had granted the new sentencing hearing on the grounds that the jury at Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s 1982 trial was not given proper death-penalty instructions. But the U.S. Supreme Court this year, in rejecting a similar Ohio case, ordered the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges to rethink its decision.</p>
<p>Under Pennsylvania law, Abu-Jamal should have received a life sentence if a single juror found the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating factors in the slaying of Officer Daniel Faulkner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the verdict form, under a section that begins, &#8220;We, the jury, have found unanimously  &hellip;,&#8221; the jury said it found the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating ones. The jury listed Faulkner&rsquo;s death on duty as the lone aggravating factor and Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s prior clean record, at age 27, as the sole mitigating factor.</p>
<p>The possible jury instructions flaw has turned into Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s most fruitful avenue of appeal to date. He has so far failed with his broader argument: that racism by the trial judge and prosecutors corrupted his conviction at the hands of a mostly white jury.</p>
<p>Faulkner, a white 25-year-old patrolman, had pulled over Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s brother on a darkened downtown street in 1981. Prosecutors say Abu-Jamal saw the traffic stop and shot Faulkner, who managed to shoot back. A wounded Abu-Jamal, his own gun nearby, was still at the scene when police arrived.</p>
<p>Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s writings and radio broadcasts from death row have made him a cause celebre and the subject of numerous books and movies. Hundreds of death-penalty opponents and other supporters demonstrated outside the courthouse before and after the hearing, waving banners and shouting &#8220;Free Mumia!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the courtroom Tuesday, two police widows sat behind Burns.</p>
<p>Both Maureen Faulkner and Kimmy Pawlowski were 25 when their police-officer husbands were slain in Philadelphia. Each man had been on the job five years.</p>
<p>A jury deadlock on Monday led a judge to spare the life of the man who fatally shot John Pawlowski last year. The verdict distressed his widow, who was pregnant with their first child when her husband died.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maureen Faulkner has spent much of her life monitoring Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s death-row appeals, returning to Philadelphia from the West Coast when necessary. Monday marked her 31st wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>&#8220;To think that I&rsquo;m sitting in a courtroom at age 54,&#8221; she told The Associated Press. &#8220;People need not to forget that my husband was laying on a street in Philadelphia and this man bent over and shot him, within inches, between the eyes. With malice. He wanted to murder my husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amnesty International, which published a study of the case in 2000, issued a statement Tuesday supporting the inmate&rsquo;s appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Amnesty International does not take a position on guilt or innocence, the organization maintains that Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s original trial, which was irredeemably tainted by politics and race, failed to meet international fair trial standards,&#8221; said Laura Moye, director of Amnesty International USA&rsquo;s Death Penalty Abolition Campaign.<br>

		<p>What with all the political wrangling and posturing by defense attornies, and the minions of supporters with all their overly-elaborate alibis, it completely falls short on the average citizen monitoring this case that if Mumia truly were innocent, how come HE never said who actually shot Daniel Faulkner?&hellip;He was the one closest to the action, and he was fully conscious when they recovered him at the scene&hellip;How come he never said who really did it?&hellip;Duh!</p>

&ldquo;While Amnesty International does not take a position on guilt or innocence, the organization maintains that Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s original trial, which was irredeemably tainted by politics and race, failed to meet international fair trial standards,&rdquo; said Laura Moye, director of Amnesty International USA&rsquo;s Death Penalty Abolition Campaign.<br>

<p>Liars.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The death penalty is the ultimate denial of human rights. It is the premeditated and cold-blooded killing of a human being by the state. This cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment is done in the name of justice.</p>
<p>It violates the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p>Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty" rel="nofollow">http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty</a></p>
<p>You cannot be &#8216;without exception&rsquo; against the death penalty and willing to weigh the case only on it&rsquo;s merits.  Bias _instantly_ attaches.</p>
<p>Given that this is the reality:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;To think that I&rsquo;m sitting in a courtroom at age 54,&rdquo; she told The Associated Press. &ldquo;People need not to forget that my husband was laying on a street in Philadelphia and this man bent over and shot him, within inches, between the eyes. With malice. He wanted to murder my husband.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>One wonders if you understand that murder has already been done and U.S. citizens are tired of paying for this man&rsquo;s meals while we slowly kill him with imprisonment.</p>
<p>Finish The Job.</p>

		<p>Personally, I have no idea if Mumia is guilty or innocent, or if his original sentencing was fair or not, or if he should have had a different jury or if the judge should have given different instructions or whatever. The thing that blows my mind about his case (and a lot of other cases I&rsquo;ve read about) is how long it takes for the so-called &#8220;justice system&#8221; to get anything done, especially in death-penalty cases. His original trial took place in 1982. That was over a quarter-of-a-century ago. What have the courts been doing all that time? How can they possibly justify a delay like this? All of these legal issues should have been resolved one way or another decades ago. I mean, come on. If there was a problem with the original trial, then hold another trial or change the sentence to life or let the guy go  &mdash;  whatever is called for  &mdash;  but RESOLVE the issue. DO SOMETHING. The impression I get is that these judges and lawyers are just milking the system for all it&rsquo;s worth. They wait a couple years, hold a hearing  &mdash;  maybe  &mdash;  then go back to sleep for another couple of years while the whole case floats around in limbo. Meanwhile, the convict  &mdash;  guilty or not  &mdash;  sits in prison year after year and the relatives of the victim keep getting older and older, dragging themselves off to watch the latest appeal hearing and hoping that the droning lawyers and judges will make a decision before they drop dead from old age. The thought of Mrs. Faulkner flying across the country to attend these hearings is gut-wrenching. How can these &#8220;legal authorities&#8221; look at themselves in the mirror every morning? The system as it currently exists is an absolute disgrace.</p>

		<p>I say this here at AR with every Mumia story, so I apologize to all of you in advance for being such a broken record.  But a lie is a lie, and it has to be countered every time it appears:</p>
<p>The reason the contention that Mumia is a victim of a &#8220;racist justice system&#8221; is a crock is because it happened in Philadelphia.  Pennsylvania, not Mississippi.  Now, he might have a point if it were Philadephia, MS (though I would not agree with it), but Phila., PA is a city whose civic elite has always been even bigger into kooky racial egalitarianism borne of Quaker mores and ethics, going back to the days of Ben Franklin.  About the only places in the country more hostile to &#8220;white racism&#8221; are Boulder CO and Berkeley CA.</p>

		<p>The incident happened early in the morning with multiple witnesses. Other officers arrived within 4 minutes. Officer Faulkner was laying on the ground with bullets from Jamal&rsquo;s gun in him. Jamal was laying on the ground with bullets from officer Faulkner&rsquo;s gun in him. While Jamal was being wheeled through the hospital he was screaming that he had shot the officer and hoped he dies. There is absolutely no doubt about his guilt. The only problem I see is that Jamal still has a pulse.</p>

		<p>Most of us will die of old age before cop killer Mumia is executed as he deserves to be.  And to Anonymous #3, while in prison Mumia once accidentally admitted his culpability in the murder when talking to a sympathetic visitor.</p>

		<p> This case should shame everyone connected with the U.S. justice system. This sly, manipulating thug should have been executed years ago   &mdash;   MANY years ago. Instead, pettifogging lawyers and pointy-headed judges are still finding excuses to keep him alive.</p>
<p> And they&rsquo;re doing it with the wholehearted support of Amnesty International, and of idiot White liberals everywhere. Want to know why our side is slowly losing the battle of race? Then, look at this case.</p>

		<p>Beside Maureen Faulkner there were several other wives of slain white Philly PD officers at that meeting. One of the younger widows actually said that she believed that in these cases, some jurors lied in order to get on the jury so that they could &#8220;get their peer off&#8221;. Her message was quite clear. I admired her for her bravery. That&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s been happening. </p>
<p>There used to be a universal code among the police that if someone killed a police officer and was taken alive, it was an automatic death sentence. IN some cases that sentence was carried out at the time of the apprehension. Wesley Cook, AKA Mumia Abu Jamal who was also wounded would have been ridden around in the Paddy Wagon until he bled out.</p>
<p>He screamed out in the emergency room that  &#8221; I shot the mf and I hope he dies&#8221;.</p>

		<p><i>Meanwhile, Maureen Faulkner has spent much of her life monitoring Abu-Jamal&rsquo;s death-row appeals</i></p>
<p>I cannot imagine the torture and injustice Maureen Faulkner and her family have endured for the past 29 years.</p>
<p>She has consistently gone to battle with those who have promoted the case and cause of Abu-Jamal and has been subjected to attacks on her credibility, repeated, obscenity-laden E-mail missives and death threats from supporters of Abu-Jamal, spat upon and threatened by members of MOVE and been screamed at in front of the courthouse:  <i>Nobody cares about you or that *** cop that deserved to die!</i> and <i>We&rsquo;re glad your husband is dead, he got what he deserved!</i></p>
<p>Maureen Faulkner states:</p>
<p><i>In 1982, when Jamal was unanimously sentenced to death by a jury that he helped pick, I never could have even imagined that, nine years into the next century, my family and I would still be taking time from our lives to attend appeals hearings&hellip;This process is obscene in the way it taints the survivors&rsquo; lives for so long. You can never move on. There&rsquo;s never any closure: just endless rounds of hearings and motions made by new batches of crusading attorneys. . It&rsquo;s all so wrong.</i><br>
 <br>
Yes, the injustice to Daniel Faulkner&rsquo;s family IS so wrong.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s guilty, no question about it. The cop&rsquo;s bullet was dug out of him; that&rsquo;s hard to explain away. He&rsquo;s got this noisy group of lefty radicals as his constituency who turn out for him and have made him their cause. He&rsquo;s adopted this radical pose and played along with them as they are the ones who&rsquo;ve kept him alive all these years. He&rsquo;ll probably end up dying of natural causes, freeing up the radical crazies to adopt yet another pet project.  </p>

		<p>Why anyone would advocate for this nut job Jamal is beyond me. What strikes me as incredible, is that after 27 years of judicial wrangling over nothing, never once has Jamal ever said he didn&rsquo;t do it. Not once. Ever. <br>
He&rsquo;s as guilty as sin and should&rsquo;ve been swinging at the end of a rope a long time ago. </p>

<p>Right 100 % Wesley Cook [his real name] NEVER has said he did NOT do it. Just that he did not get a fair trial, etc.</p>
<p>The brother of Wesley Cook did not even dare to testify on behalf of his brother. All the brother of Wesley said &#8220;keep me outta this!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was actually very surprised when the death sentence of Mr. Cook was reinstated. Let us hope that Wesley Cook gets his just due.</p>
