<h1>Cops Claim Wigout Over Bad Hair Day</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Heslam and Laura Crimaldi, Boston Herald, Nov. 17, 2010 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Lynn couple got tangled in a hairy situation when the cops showed up at their basement apartment after the woman went after her husband with a 15-inch knife when he wouldn&rsquo;t help her tame her tresses, according to the police version of events.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kaukauna admits the big to-do started early Saturday as she sat on her bed, taking out her old hair weave.</p>
<p>Her plan, she said, was to color her short, graying locks with Revlon jet black hair dye and put in her new hair weaves, which she had recently picked up on sale for $3 a piece at a nearby beauty supply store.</p>
<p>As she removed the old weaves, she asked her hubby, Kenneth &#8220;Kenny&#8221; Rudolph, 48, to fix her some food so she could finish the tedious task. &#8220;I was getting sort of hungry,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He had other plans. Kenny said he didn&rsquo;t feel like cooking and wanted to go out. Kaukauna said he was &#8220;tipsy&#8221; and she didn&rsquo;t want him to leave. A bitter argument erupted. Kenny, apparently alarmed, dialed 911. Meanwhile, Kaukauna claims she went into the kitchen to start cooking. Hence the big knife that was in her hands when the cops showed up.</p>
<p>Police say they heard yelling inside. Kenny answered the door and said his wife &#8220;came at me with a knife&#8221; and it&rsquo;s &#8220;all about her asking me to help do her hair and I don&rsquo;t do hair,&#8221; according to a police report.</p>
<p>Kaukauna, police said, had her knife behind her back. When a cop reached for it, she tried to shove it down her shorts. She pleaded not guilty to assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the Republicans should nominate Kaukauna for the presidential run in 2012. How else will they beat Comrade Obama, unless they out-diversity the Democrats, right? </p>
<p>And here we have diversity a plenty, and not just racial and gender diversity either. It is diversity in: cosmetics, cooking, conflict resolution, and socioeconomics, that we are looking at here. It would appear in other words, that whether sober or intoxicated, Kaukauna has the sort of can do attitude and budgeting foresight to see that self reliance is a must in beauty and culinary matters, so much so, that preventative measures can be useful in dealing with an antagonist via a butcher knife. Just the sort of Neo Con strategy we need back in the White House.</p>
<p>American multicultural politics at its finest; not even Karl Rove or Dick Morris can beat this!</p>

		<p>For a non-Bantu police officer to have to respond to a 911 &#8220;domestic disturbance&#8221; in a Bantu neighborhood, is more frightening than staring down North Korea&rsquo;s Taepdong missiles.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m surprised this neighborhood didn&rsquo;t explode in a riot.</p>

		<p>If she just recently bought new weaves how long did she have the old weaves in her hair? How often and how at all did she wash her hair with the old weaves in? No wonder the husband didn&rsquo;t want to help her or possibly even touch her! I would have ran out of there too!!!</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t most people put a 15 inch knife down on the counter when they go to answer the door?</p>

		<p>Leave it to the media to put a humorous twist on this depressing behavior. I&rsquo;m sure the cops weren&rsquo;t laughing.</p>

		<p>A 15-inch knife?  Do they even make them that large for kitchen use?  My largest chef&rsquo;s knife is 8-inches, as even 10-inches is way too much knife for me.<br>
So, who uses a 15-inch knife for food prep?  Are they counting the handle?</p>
