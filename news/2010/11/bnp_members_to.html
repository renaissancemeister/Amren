<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/nov/02/bnp-members-barred-teaching">BNP Members to Be Barred From Teaching</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeevan Vasagar, Guardian (London), November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Headteachers are to be given the power to dismiss teachers who are members of the BNP or other groups which have an &#8220;extremist tenor&#8221;.</p>
<p>The pledge by the education secretary, Michael Gove, follows the case of a BNP activist who used a school laptop to post comments describing some immigrants as &#8220;filth&#8221;. Gove said he would allow school heads and governing bodies to sack teachers for membership of the far-right party. Members of the BNP are barred from working as police or prison officers.</p>
<p>The minister told the Guardian: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe that membership of the BNP is compatible with being a teacher. One of the things I plan to do is to allow headteachers and governing bodies the powers and confidence to be able to dismiss teachers engaging in extremist activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would extend that to membership of other groups which have an extremist tenor. I cannot see how membership of the British National party can co-exist with shaping young minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crackdown was welcomed by the NASUWT teaching union, which has called for a ban. Its general secretary, Chris Keates, said: &#8220;I hope this is something Michael Gove takes forward as quickly as possible. It is an important part of safeguarding the interests of young people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adam Walker, a BNP member and teacher at a school near Sunderland, was cleared of racial and religious intolerance by a disciplinary panel in June this year. He wrote in an online forum that Britain was a &#8220;dumping ground for the filth of the third world&#8221;. But while the panel said the comments were troubling, it was not satisfied that they showed intolerance.</p>
<p>Delivering the General Teaching Council&rsquo;s verdict, the chair, Angela Stones, said: &#8220;A negative comment about immigration to the UK of itself need not be indicative of racist views or racial intolerance, since the race of immigrants is extremely varied.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GTC, the profession&rsquo;s watchdog, was abolished a week later. In a Commons statement, Gove cited the decision made on the Walker case as &#8220;quite wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>The previous government ruled out banning BNP members from teaching after an independent inquiry into racism in schools decided it would be disproportionate. Maurice Smith, a former chief inspector of schools, said a ban would be &#8220;taking a very large sledgehammer to crack a minuscule nut&#8221;. He also described it as a &#8220;profound political act&#8221;.</p>
<p>The review found that in the past seven years four teachers and two governors had been publicly identified as members of racist organisations, and that only nine incidents of teachers making racist remarks or possessing racist material had been subject to GTC disciplinary sanction.</p>
<p>Critics say this review over-emphasised the number of incidents, rather than their potential impact on a classroom. Keates said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s not an issue of scale. That was our biggest criticism of Maurice Smith&rsquo;s report. T the issue is one of making sure that a clear message goes out that membership of the BNP and other extremist groups is incompatible with being a teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gove outlined plans to ban the BNP from classrooms in an interview in which he also said he would not oppose parents and teachers if they rejected his traditionalist views on the curriculum.</p>
<p>At this year&rsquo;s Conservative party conference, Gove said historian Simon Schama would advise on an overhaul of the history curriculum to ensure that no pupil leaves school without learning &#8220;narrative British history&#8221;. English teaching will also be reformed to ensure that canonical writers such as Pope, Shelley, Dryden, Dickens and Hardy are at the heart of the curriculum.</p>
<p>He said he believed there was an &#8220;unfulfilled appetite&#8221; for a more classical education. But he insisted teachers could steer their own course. &#8220;The idea of the reforms I&rsquo;m about to bring about is that if the professional wisdom of teachers takes them in a different direction, and the common sense of parents takes that direction, I won&rsquo;t stand in their way.&#8221;<br>

<p>On any given day in British classrooms someone will preach Marxist communist dogma, anti-white hate, and open-border propaganda, but honest nationalism is the only sentiment which is censored. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be more afraid of the Labour Party shaping young minds.  I have a question for our British readers   &mdash;   is homeschooling allowed in your country?  Or is there no choice but to accept state indoctrination for your children?  </p>

<p>Apparently, the GTC wouldn&rsquo;t discriminate against the BNP so Gove had it disbanded.</p>

		<p>This unconstitutional as this is a bill of attainder.  Cummings v. Missouri, states:</p>
<p>A bill of attainder, is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without judicial trial and includes any legislative act which takes away the life, liberty or property of a particular named or easily ascertainable person or group of persons because the legislature thinks them guilty of conduct which deserves punishment.</p>
<p>U.S. v. Lovett was a case historically relevant to taking away pay checks of government workers Congress could accuse of being Communists. This was an asset forfeiture case. It states:</p>
<p>Legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a trial, are &#8216;bills of attainder&rsquo; prohibited under this clause.</p>
<p>How long will it be before these laws will be applied to you??</p>

		<p>This is absolutely the right action and serves as a useful precedent. It needs to be extended to those who write schoolbooks as well (a position much more influential than a mere teacher, and one much easier to police). Of course those who need weeded out are those who single whites out as &#8216;oppressors&rsquo; and single out all whites, no matter their history or circumstances, as privileged. It&rsquo;s the least a concerned society can do.  </p>

		<p>Even moderates were predicting that the last elections were likely to be the very last even vaguely resembling democracy.  The ruling class think they can control the immigrant voters much like Stalins useful idiots but this will only be a very short transition to a full Islamic hell hole.  </p>

<p>First of all, click on the link provided at the foot of the article and note that even &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; readers of the decidedly left-of-center &#8216;Guardian&rsquo; find this idea unpalatable.</p>
<p>Wait and see whether the ludicrous Gove gets away with this and -if so - whether or not it will be challenged in the courts of the U.K. or in Europe.</p>
<p>Concerning Adam Walker, he was alleged to have &#8216;demonstrated views suggestive of racial and religious intolerance&rsquo; while using a school computer &hellip;</p>

<p>Britain doesn&rsquo;t have a written constitution, so comparing our jurisprudence to theirs doesn&rsquo;t make much sense in this case. Oftentimes, their Parliament will pass knee-jerk legislation, especially where guns and &#8220;hate speech&#8221; are concerned.</p>

		<p>I was terminated from my teaching position by a member of Trinity Church (Rev. Wright/Obama).  They practice Black Liberation Theology which openly calls for the genocide of white people.  I think the fact that I am white and had a Ron Paul bumper sticker on my car had a lot to do with it.  One of my back co-workers even observed that she wouldn&rsquo;t have &#8220;done me that way&#8221; if I were black. </p>

<p>So true!  Just as in the good ole USA any White solidarity party will and IS demonized as &#8220;racist&#8221; (who cares to begin with, they should be!) and they are given negative attention, if any attention at all. And most of that negative attention is coming from the clueless, moronic, White population who the party is trying to save. Talk about the mindless sheep.</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t beat totalitarians by playing by the rules, if you start to win they&rsquo;ll just change the rules.  This is a major problem for Conservatives since, as Tim Wise made clear, what their totalitarian opponents want is basically them dead.  <i>What we have is ours, what you have is negotiable</i>,  and <i>We want you dead</i> pretty much sums up the bargaining position of the left.  Those Conservatives who go on about &#8220;civil debate&#8221; and &#8220;why can&rsquo;t we all just be non-hyphenated Americans&#8221; fully understand what they&rsquo;re up against and what the end result is going to be, they&rsquo;re just crooks who are gaming the system for money,  maximizing their profits by scamming the doomed victims with false hope.  </p>

		<p>Sooooo, they can sack people who belong to &#8216;other groups which have an &ldquo;extremist tenor&rdquo;&rsquo; does that include members past and present of the NUJ (National union of journalists) ? After all the head of it is the current Communist party of Great Britain leader&hellip; Or the Socialist workers party, an extreme left wing Marxist group active on many a campus.</p>
<p>Or UNITE or the ALF or or or or or, I bet not. </p>

<p>I remember seeing that movie many moons ago and at my younger age at that time I had a sinking feeling in my stomach when I saw the two different races &#8220;falling in love&#8221;. I knew nothing of the word &#8220;racist&#8221; at that time and the agenda of Hollywood at that time to incrementally bring even more interracial mixing onto the scene. Over the years I have come to see that this was all deliberate to make Whites and only Whites, to be brainwashed into believing we are &#8220;racists&#8221; if we do not follow their genocidal war against us. After years of connecting the dots, it is plain to see for anyone who has eyes to see.</p>

		<p>If the British really want to overcome fools such as this Gove character (and all of his kind), they will not be able to do it civilly.  They will have to take to the streets.  Given the UK ban on guns, there are still ways to make them hurt.  It might require some creativity, but it can be done if one has the will to do it.  How in the name of God can a land so steeped in tradition give way to this liberal nonsense over the course of the past 50 years?  How many &#8220;traditionalists&#8221; are left?  </p>
<p>&#8220;And they shall beat their ploughshares into swords and their pruning hooks into spears.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Hmmmm&hellip;.leftists in the USA still go into a frenzy about McCarthyism, yet here we have a clear example of people being denied employment over their politics. Of course, the Communist Party was working to overthrow the US Constitution, so it was OK. As for the BNP, how dare they try to defend British civilization?</p>
