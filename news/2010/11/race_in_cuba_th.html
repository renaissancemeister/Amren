<h1>Race in Cuba: The Eternal &#8216;Black Problem&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leonardo Padura, The Root, July 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><em>When it comes to race, Cuba is far from the utopia that black intellectuals like to think it is. As part of The Root&rsquo;s series exploring the island&rsquo;s color complex, Cuba&rsquo;s best-known novelist weighs in.</em></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racism  &mdash;  like prostitution, corruption and religion  &mdash;  didn&rsquo;t disappear because of a socialist magical spell: Although diminished and quiet, it survived among the people, and today, in fact, in certain nonofficial circles, its incidence in the complex narrative of contemporary Cuban society is openly debated.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem necessary to go over the reasons that forged racism in Cuba. They&rsquo;re the same that, with European conquest and colonization, were imposed on the rest of the Americas with the hegemonic focus on the metropolis, which, as we know, depended for three long centuries on the importation of African slaves to sustain the economies of extensive regions in which the indigenous Amerindian populations had been or were being extinguished.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The black problem&#8221; is so fundamental, the matter of ethnic origin among the island&rsquo;s inhabitants so dramatic, and racism so persistent among those with decision and economic power that Cuba&rsquo;s independence from the Spanish empire was delayed by almost a century precisely because of its large number of blacks. (At certain points in the 19th century, blacks made up 60 percent of the resident population.) They were a people who had been exploited and who, in a moment of institutional disorder, it was feared might try to vindicate their rights and their humanity, as had happened in the neighboring colony of Saint Domingue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The curious, contradictory and painful part is that various historians and sociologists also agree that the persistent &#8220;black problem&#8221; is still with us today, in the 21st century, urgently and tensely waiting for a definitive solution that never comes, in spite of laws, decrees and official edicts that paternalistically (but that are, deep down, racist) try to stipulate ethnic representation in certain affairs of state, government and the Communist Party. As if a few more dark faces in the official apparatus could really be an answer to the profound problems that have so much to do with economics and social thought and so little to do with the utopian volunteerism of our leaders who, in the end, are simply practicing politics with their &#8220;anti-discrimination&#8221; decrees.</p>
<p>The painful truth is that, in Cuba, the vast majority of the prison population is black or mixed-race. The most physically ruined parts of the cities are those where most black and mixed-raced Cubans, weighed down by spiritual burdens and secular misery, have lived for generations. They are also the ones who, in the economic and social climbing of the last few decades, are least represented &hellip; and let&rsquo;s not mention certain attitudes, repressive attitudes  &mdash;  in other words, the attitude of the Cuban police, where blacks are mostly concentrated at the bottom of the pyramid  &mdash;  that treat dark-skinned persons with much greater rigor &hellip; precisely because of the color of their skin.</p>

		<p>I work around a LOT of latinos of all colors and mixes.  I do agree from personal observation that there are serious differences among them based on race, class, ethnicity and national origin.  </p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re all marching around shouting &#8220;Si se Puede&#8221; (yes we can) they tell everyone they&rsquo;re united as &#8220;latinos.&#8221;  But in reality, they will never be one people.  How can they when they are so different from each other?</p>

<p>If that is the case, then shouldn&rsquo;t crime be virtually non-existent among the blacks in Cuba, just as it should be here as well, since the same charge is made about our own police? Instead, black cities in the US are so crime-ridden that virtually nobody who can afford to move wants to live there  &mdash;  including blacks themselves. </p>

		<p> Most of the Cubans I&rsquo;ve known here in America have been middle and upper class white Spanish refugees from Castro. These are fine people who fit in well in the old Creole culture of Louisiana. I can imagine that Cuba became a much darker and more violent country after these folks left. The late Caesar Romero would be a good example of this class of Cuban citizen.  </p>

		<p>Yes, the black intellectual class (is that an oxymoron?) have long claimed Cuba was a race less Utopia. Everyone else knew otherwise but black academics championed the belief with regular student junkets that were supposed to show students a true race less society.</p>
<p>Race is a genetic reality and gene expression knows no border or political ideology. Blacks in Africa, America, or Cuba will always fall to their innate station in life. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s their IQ?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s above 80, they could be one-eyed kings in Africa where 65-70 is the norm.  There is a certain &#8216;guest&rsquo; reality to be faced here people: if you are not wanted but refuse to leave, sooner or later you will be ignored.  In everything.</p>
<p>Because nobody likes you.</p>
<p>That is a -terrible- burden to have to deal with.  And I honestly am not sure that even repatriation at this point would help because Africa is even more overcrowded and under-opportunitied and of course ethnics can recognize exogroups of nominally their own race better than anyone.  And are just as discriminatory.</p>
<p>But the fact remains.  NO ONE wants these people in the Western World.  And at some point, someone or many among them must hit upon that reality as a non-entity reason for their continual denial of position on the social ladder.</p>
<p>Not that they are evil.  Not that they are stupid.</p>
<p>But simply that they are _not wanted_ by people who did not enslave their grandfather&rsquo;s X10 generation.  And want no part of the guilt for those who did.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
They are also the ones who, in the economic and social climbing of the last few decades, are least represented &hellip; and let&rsquo;s not mention certain attitudes, repressive attitudes &mdash; in other words, the attitude of the Cuban police, where blacks are mostly concentrated at the bottom of the pyramid &mdash; that treat dark-skinned persons with much greater rigor &hellip; precisely because of the color of their skin.<br>

<p>20% edge in testosterone levels.  Functional Adulthood by age 14.  Limited IQ and affinity driven access to any but menial activities where they build up good physiques and a whole lotta rage.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s saying that the laws designed to give special help to blacks are actually racist against them too? Africans have it all sewn up everywhere around the world. Commit enough crime and violence and not only do you intimidate everyone else but the smart people will do everything in their power to appease you too. </p>

		<p>I know some Cubans who came over in the early eighties.  They are spanish-drived people, quite European in their appearance.  They remain in the Cuban community, the strongest portion of which are white Spanish people.  </p>
<p>These are the people that Castro drove out, now he has a population similar to Haiti.  His human capital is a negative!</p>
<p>If we truly had wanted to see Castro fail, we would never have taken a single immigrant from that country.  Maybe shipped in some guns or money, but mostly just let the pot simmer.  But no, we essentially high-graded the population of Cuba (except for Mariel people), and skimmed off the top ten or twenty percent.</p>
<p>And do you think these people would return to Cuba given a chance to do so?  According to the answers I got from this question, none would return.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The black problem&rdquo; is due to the violent nature and low intelligence of black Africans, not that they are perceived &#8220;different&#8221;.  This &#8220;problem&#8221; exists everywhere they may be on the planet.  Even in China there are problems developing regarding Africans.  Surprisingly the Chinese have not started eating them, yet.</p>

		<p>read The Manchurian President.  There is a whole web of communists/socialist/marxists network in this country.  All the radical blacks belong to this network including obama, gates (the black radical &#8220;professor of african studies&#8221; at harvard, who got arrested = beer summit because obama called the cops stupid, &#8220;rev&#8221; wright, the main guy of black islamism, black panthers, valerie jarrett (closest advisor to obama), michelle obama (now her statement of this is the first time, i am proud of my country makes sense), etc. also non-whites, ayers, david axelrod, etc.  unfortunately, the elite unversities in this country have brought into all the racism shakedowns and are actually helping it along. all/obama have been highly trained in the teachings of saul alinsky.  one of alinsky&rsquo;s teachings, in order to collapse this country, bore within its foundations (institutions), which obama unfortunately have succeeded by becoming president.  he is a man with a mask which the public finally detected in this last election.  hopefully, there is still hope for this country.  also, this network keeps a close eye on such organizations as this one.  they are behind the difficulty of this organization in trying to find a hotel for its last conference.    </p>

		<p>This is one reason why I think America should end its embargo on Cuba and trade as much as possible with it (we trade with China. We trade with Saudi Arabia.). Cuba could implode one day and we could have a Mariel boatlift X10, or X20.</p>

		<p>Truly those who would call themselves &#8220;racial realists&#8221; are foolish.  You read an article like this and actually believe it, consider it.  Try to refute it.</p>
<p>Let me give a reality check.  The same leftists that use non-whites as a tool of genocide against whites are the ones who took over cuba.  The terms democrat, progressive, communist and nazi practically mean the exact same things.  I&rsquo;m sure each would babble on endlessly about inanities and supposed differences.  But look at their behaviors and what they enable and support.  Virtually identical.</p>
<p>Why are you so surprised that a totalitarian state like cuba has the same problems like the US?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by design.  It&rsquo;s ALWAYS by design.</p>
<p>Stop letting these people claim the moral highground with the made up term, racism.  Racism did not exist as a concept before communism.  It&rsquo;s supposed inverse of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; also does not exist.  The left is guilty of the grossest crimes imaginable.  Genocide on a scale unimaginable before they came on the scene.  Dehumanized whole races as if they were some biological warfare weapon instead of people to put against each other.  These people are monsters.</p>
<p>They give lip service to the welfare of non-whites then use them (use them against US) in the worst ways imaginable.  Stop listening to their words and pay attention to their behaviors and things will make a heck of alot more sense.</p>
<p>Cuba is a good example.  What exactly about making blacks and whites equally experienced at tasting the lash of slavery is good for race relations?  What is surprising about this?</p>
<p>Equality in terms that these people define means equally enslaved.  Equally degraded.  Equally forced to live together in ways that are unnatural. Equally turned into units of someone else&rsquo;s wealth as opposed to free men.  The very idea that this would have any positive result whatsoever is ludicrous in the extreme.  The very premise about which this author writes the article shows a divorce from reality of such extreme character that he might as well be a raving psychotic.</p>
<p>He should be treated as such.</p>

		<p>During a holiday visit to Cuba two years ago, I noticed that the labourers around the hotel complexes were mostly black people.   None of the hotel service staff or even entertainers were black.  The only black person who we came into close contact with was during immigration where my wife was rudely interrogated (on her own) and asked several times if she was Cuban.   As we came from Spain where we are retired, his suspicions were for that reason but although she speaks Spanish, my wife has the original British accent because the UK was where she was born and is obviously not Spanish born.</p>

		<p>Its unspoken and theoretically does not exist, but reality racism is alive and well in Latin America. I cant speak of Cuba, for as an a American we are not allowed to visit. But I can speak of Panama, Costa Rica, and my 3 months a year I live in Medellin Colombia. Blacks are the same there as here and everywhere, causing a disproportionate number of the problems. Speaking spanish and knowing a lot of the businesspeople in the latin countries I have lived in, I can say without doubt that the populace of these countries know exactly how blacks are and do not sugar coat thier attributes. The blacks always fall to the bottom of the barrell. Due to a lack of a level of welfare we have in the USA, the blacks have to do nominally more just to exist. An interesting thing about all of latin america that I have seen with my extensive time there is that you can about 99% of the time determine class by skin color. We dont see the white latins here, they are not the dark skinned illegals crossing in the desert that we see in the supermarket or elsewhere, but about 10ish % are completely or mostly white. My girlfreind is completely white and if you saw her in the supermarket you would just think she is a very pretty white american girl. These white ones run the countries, the banks, and the businesses, or at least until they go communist like is now happening in Venezuela with the darker skinned Hugo Chavez, and Morales in Bolivia ect. A perfect example of a white mexican is ex president Fox of Mexico, as white as any of us on this site. Remember several years ago when he was complaining and said something like this,, Mexicans in the US do jobs that not even blacks will do&hellip; Big stink with Al Sharpton after that comment. But thats how they think, they know how blacks are even though there is officially equality among all latinos.  KF </p>

 <br>
Racial prejudice is not the result of misconceptions handed down through the generations because no one thinks to examine them against reality.  Racial prejudice is reinforced by repeated experiences.  <br>
 <br>
Stereotypes are over generalizations of what is really true. Anti Semites do not claim that Jews are stupid.  They complain that Jews are &#8220;too bright by half,&#8221; as though superior intelligence is a deficiency.   </p>

<p>You insult the Chinese by saying &#8220;they haven&rsquo;t started eating them, yet&#8221;. Why WOULD the Chinese want to imitate black behavior by eating Bantus?</p>
<p>Simple arrest, trial, conviction and imprisonment suffices.</p>
<p><br>
Whenever you have different ethnic groups of people living in a territory, you&rsquo;re going to get prejudicial feelings - there&rsquo;s no way around it. No amount of government proclamations about &#8220;all men are brothers&#8221;, is going to change it. No amount of laws passed is going to change it. Heck, slavery goes on in some parts of the world to this day, by member states of the United Nations.</p>

<p>Good post about stereotypes. They are based on observations. Consider:</p>
<p>From the times of antiquity, every visitor to black Africa remarked upon the sexual proclivities and prowess of blacks, and their seeming preoccupation with sex.. From the ancient Egyptians, Greek, Romans, Arabs and others who came after them. Are all these people guilty of stereotyping what blacks themselves take a delightful (to them, anyway) pride in, namely bragging about their sexual prowess and the size of their genitals? They themselves nourish these stereotypes, and then howl &#8220;racism&#8221; whenever they&rsquo;re called on the carpet for it, by non-blacks.</p>

High crime correlates quite strongly with low IQ. Think maybe these blacks in Communist Cuba all end up in prison for the same reasons that blacks in (nominally) Capitalist USA do, i.e. that they commit a lot of dumb crimes and aren&rsquo;t smart enough to evade capture? </p>
<p><br>

Blacks have also been credited for their ability in music, although of a rather primitive kind of music.  I like jazz and rock and roll, but I do not consider either to be on the same level as classical music, or even the folk music of the British Isles.  <br>
 <br>
If blacks had not been brought over as slaves, i think American popular music would be more influenced by Celtic music, and that it would be more melodic, softer, and more romantic.  </p>

		<p>Why is it that when so called Hispanics or Latinos from Latin or South America get together with White Americans they insist on not calling themselves White? I have seen this in person and via TV or the big screen. Rick Sanchez late of CNN to my knowledge has always called himself a Cuban, a Latino, or person of color, but never a White Person. I would bet that in the company of only Hispanics he would lord it all over a mulatto or a mestizo about his complexion. </p>

<p>I am not aware of this at all. (In fact, I&rsquo;ve seen the reverse - Latinos indignant at not being considered white.)</p>
<p>But if it is so, then it&rsquo;s obviously because in the USA, in recent decades, it&rsquo;s become advantageous to claim to be non-white. If you&rsquo;re other-than-white, you qualify for all the benefits;  if you&rsquo;re just white, you get nothing. With the USA as anti-white as it is today, who would want to be white?</p>

<p>Well,  please  name&#8221;every visitor  to [so-called] black  Africa&#8221;. Herodotus visited  &#8220;black Africa&#8221;  &mdash;  assumedly &#8220;black  Africa&#8221;  is  that  part  of  Africa  where blacks  make  up  the  majority  of the  population  &mdash;  since  he  wrote  that  the  Egyptians  and their  Nubian  neighbors  were  &#8220;black skinned  and  woolly  haired&#8221;.  I  don&rsquo;t  recall  him  commenting  on  the  sexual practices  of  blacks.  Ibn  Battuta  visited  Africa and  though  he  wrote  that  there  was  much  more  gender  equality  than  in  the  Arab world  he  did not  write  as  you claim  he  should have.  Leo  Frobenius,  Marcel  Griaule,  Rene  Cailloux and  a  host  of  others  visited, and  their reporting  does  not  fit  with  what  you  claim.  </p>
<p>Engleman,<br>
The  music of  Africa  is  varied  &mdash;  with  all  kinds  of  string  instruments, drums,  xylophone/piano type  instruments, wind  instruments(flutes,etc.).  So  to  claim  carte blanche  that  African  music  is  &#8220;primitive&#8221;  is  just  wrong.  The  Kora, for  example, is  a  21 string  instrument  &mdash;  which  I  doubt  you  could  ever  learn  to  play.  The  thumb piano  is  also  not  easy  to  learn,  plus  the  one-stringed  banjo  accompanied by  singing.</p>

<p>You bring up a good point. I&rsquo;ve said before and will continue to say that the Colonial Spanish presence in what is,today,California,Arizona,New Mexico,and Texas was a lot whiter than current day activists from la raza are willing to admit.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there to observe for myself,so this is speculation on my part,but I feel reasonably comfortable with my view that men like Juan Seguin and the other Tejanos involved in the Texas War of Independence did NOT-</p>
<p>Take up arms and rebel against the established order ( or lack thereof ) so that they could be assured of having a batch of little mulatto grandchildren running around their estates.<br>

Cuba could easily deport all of its blacks there, where they would be among their own kind and by definition no longer oppressed.</p>

Now, hip hop is descended to the original level of native black music, but with the annoying, desperately unsophisticated misuse of white technology.</p>

<p>I have no disagreement with you.  I suspect that you are right. </p>
<p>However, I do note that (in tune with our times) recent accounts of the settlement of California stress (and they do make a point of this) that most of the original families were mulattoes or mestizos to some degree, and rather few were purely white.   This, I suspect, is just more of the anti-white re-writing of history that is going on all about us. Pandering to La Raza!  I do not personally know the facts, but I tend to be dubious about these claims. They are just too convenient. All of a sudden, this new information has come to light. (The reason offered being  that their present descendents were too embarassed to admit it before. All due to &#8220;racism&#8221;, you know.)</p>

<p>Loud? Pushy? Inconsiderate?  That&rsquo;s a good description of Spanish, and indeed Latins in general, even all Mediterraneans, not just Cubans!</p>
<p>I often spend the summer in Sweden and Finland. Scandinavia is indundated with Italians and Spaniards in summer, and wealthy Latin Americans.  In the hotel restaurant, you could hear the Italians (and Spaniards and Mexicans) from all the way across the room!  Likewise on the street. And they are gregarious - they travel in groups, all shouting at once.  Very typical. The Swedes and Finns spoke very softly and you could barely hear a whisper. </p>
<p>As for Cesar Romero, his father was Italian.  He was born in New York City to a wealthy family in the sugar business; his mother was a concert singer from a prominent Cuban family.  I don&rsquo;t think he ever lived lived in Cuba.  He was indeed  &#8220;a Latin from Manhattan&#8221;!  He spent his entire life in the USA. So much for Cuba!  That was a contrived  screen persona, just like Cary Grant&rsquo;s debonair gentleman of  indefinite but vaguely British aristocratic background. Pure fiction!<br>

<p></p>
<p>Exactly.  &#8220;Music&#8221;, at least as Europeans define it, consists of three parts:  melody, harmony, and rhythm.  Black &#8220;music&#8221; consists almost entirely of rhythm, with hardly any melody and virtually no harmony. And no counterpoint or sophistication. It often consists of monotonously repeated chants or phrases, over and over, to the point of being hypnotic. But that exhibits their paucity of invention, since they come up with one catchy phrase or tune and just keep repeating it without &#8220;developing&#8221; it. Mozart or Beethoven, by contrast,  could take a simple melody and &#8220;develop&#8221; it into a whole symphony. </p>
<p>It should be pointed out, too, that there is a big difference between mulatto music and black music. The sophisticated songs of Duke Ellington are definitely &#8220;high yellow&#8221; music. They are not the simple ditties of Chubby Checker, the growling of Louis Armsstrong,  or the screeching of James Brown.  In fact, they are hardly &#8220;black&#8221; at all.<br>

		<p>This does bring up something: supposing the multicultists/cultural marxists succeed in Europe or North America? Will they turn over any real power to the minorities and third world migrants that they claim to represent? Or once they have disposed of the &#8220;problem&#8221; of middle Americans-European patriotic/nationalist populaces, will they turn on their own supporters and put them back into the ghetto? This is what happened in Cuba, essentially. </p>
<p>Cuba ought to give minorities in the USA-Europe some pause for consideration about their own fates after the multicultist revolution has been completed. For that matter, it ought to give majority population groups pause for consideration. Perhaps that is what is happening with the rise of nationalist movements in Europa. </p>

		<p>As a socialist and liberal race realist, I must say there is a lot of nonsense written in these comments.</p>
<p><i>I guess racial relations as well as government took a big backward step wtih Fidel. </i></p>
<p>Not so unless you are a segregationist. Cuba had legal Jim Crow segregation and hardcore discrimination against Blacks pre-Castro. That&rsquo;s all been swept aside now, maybe forever. The Blacks complain, but it&rsquo;s better then than it is now. There is more democracy than under Batista and Castro has mass popular support while Batista never did. Pre-revolution, there was nearly a one-drop rule and there was little intermarriage, or that that did were lost to the Whites as in the South. Since the Revolution, there has been mass intermarriage.</p>
<p> <i>I can imagine that Cuba became a much darker and more violent country after these folks left. </i></p>
<p>Darker, sure. More violent? No way. Certainly far less violent. For whatever reason, Cuba has less violent crime than any other state in the Americas, and Havana is the safest large city in the Americas. And they are both full of Blacks. I&rsquo;ve long said that Blacks do well under socialism. In Mozambique under Samora Machel, you could walk across Maputo in the middle of the night and not fear a thing.</p>
<p>You are welcome to speculate why there is little crime. The Cuban justice system is hardcore and they don&rsquo;t put up with any nonsense at all. It has the 6th highest imprisonment rate in the world, and the prisons are of course full of Blacks. The typical rejoinder is that those are all political prisoners. I have no recent figures, but there are probably no more than 400 political prisoners on the island. The overwhelming majority of the prison population are common criminals. Perhaps the crime rate is due because of a &#8220;lock em up&#8221; philosophy?</p>
<p> <i>Yes, the black intellectual class (is that an oxymoron?) have long claimed Cuba was a race less Utopia. </i></p>
<p>Well, there is probably less racism against Blacks there than anywhere else in the Americas, FWIW.</p>
<p> <i>What&rsquo;s their IQ?</i></p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s above 80&hellip; </p>
<p>Good question. No one seems to know, but in the rest of the Caribbean, it is around 70-75.</p>
<p> <i>Now that we have another proof that extreme leftist policies do nothing to improve life for blacks can we please stop affirmative action, integration, Third World immigration, and diversity quotas? </i></p>
<p>Surely not the case in Cuba, as the revolution has dramatically improved life there. Sure Blacks whine, but Blacks complain everywhere.</p>
<p> <i>These are the people that Castro drove out, now he has a population similar to Haiti. His human capital is a negative! </i> </p>
<p>Not so. In the Americas, Cubans have the longest life expectancy in the Americas, the lowest rate of malnutrition, the lowest infant mortality rate, have the most scientists per capita, have the lowest doctor patient ratio on Earth, are the best educated and are the healthiest people. With 2% of the population, they have 10% of the scientists. They have more agronomists per capita than anywhere else on Earth. </p>
<p>They have hooked up the whole place to running water, electricity and sewage. Everyone has access to transportation and culture and wears nice clothes. Latin America has failed to do these things for some reason.</p>
<p>It hardly sounds like a place with garbage human capital.</p>
<p><i>And do you think these people would return to Cuba given a chance to do so? </i></p>
<p>One thing that infuriates these Cuban Whites is that they had a lot of money in Cuba, but they took off really fast and left things behind like their homes. Castro quickly confiscated their homes and businesses when they left. The exiles go back to Cuba and see their fine stately homes filled with Cuban Blacks crammed into their old home, lounging on the porch, etc. The Cuban Whites are filled with rage, but do you think there is any way in Hell those Cuban Blacks are going to give those nice homes they are living in back to the Cuban Whites who left? Not on your life. This is partly how Castro stays in power. No one in Cuba wants those exiles (they call them gusanos) back.</p>
<p> <i>Cuba could implode one day and we could have a Mariel boatlift X10, or X20. </i></p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t happen. Those Blacks have it good, and implosion would bring back the White gusanos with vengeance on their minds. Every Cuban knows this. See  above.</p>
<p> <i>Slums are the products of the people who live in them. Inferior people create inferior environments, despite governmental efforts to help them. Superior people create superior environments, despite persecution.  </i> </p>
<p>It is true that the Cuban government has recently built some very nice apartment complexes for poor Blacks in Havana. Within 6 months, the Blacks had dismantled and destroyed them. There is a big debate in the Cuban sociology community right now about why.</p>
<p><i>Fortunately there is an alternative. Just 80km across the Windward Passage sits the black paradise known as Haiti. Cuba could easily deport all of its blacks there, where they would be among their own kind and by definition no longer oppressed. </i></p>
<p>Actually, Eastern Cuba is now full up with Haitians and Jamaicans fleeing the capitalist paradises of Haiti and Jamaica. Say what you will about Cuba, but Cuba looks great to your average poor Haitian or Jamaican. Cuba just lets them and tries to integrate them into society. These Blacks think Cuba is paradise compared to the places they come from. The notion that no one ever flees *to* a Communist country is false.</p>

<p>Democratic states are also laissez faire. In dictatorships and monarchies (real monarchies) the state maintains a closely guarded monopoly on power, all power, and that includes terror.<br>
They are &#8220;the only gang in town&#8221;, and they tolerate no competition.</p>
<p>With monarchies, at least you knew whom you were dealing with! Democracies spread the power around and confuse the picture, enabling some culprits to escape unnoticed. They like that.</p>
<p>Incidentally, according to Wiki, Moscow and Riga are the two least safe, most violent, cities in all of Europe! I was VERY surprised to learn about Riga. At one time (not so long ago) it would have been the reverse.</p>

		<p>Police states tend to have less crime because they first disarm the populace they rule. That&rsquo;s what Castro did in his &#8220;Armas para que? (&#8220;arms for what?&#8221;) speech in 1961, to illustrate. Police officers have said that crime in the U.S. could be drastically reduced, but if that were to happen, it would require trampling on our civil liberties, and gutting the Constitution&rsquo;s Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>No thanks. I&rsquo;d rather arm myself for self-defense, than rely on cops to protect me.</p>
