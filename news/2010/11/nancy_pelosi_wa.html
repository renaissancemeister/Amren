			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Allen and Carrie Budoff Brown, Politico, Nov. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to push for a vote during the lame-duck session on a bill that would legalize young, undocumented immigrants if they attend college or serve in the military, according to Democratic sources familiar with a leadership conference call Wednesday. </p>
<p>A vote on the bill, known as the DREAM Act, could come as early as next week, the sources said. Pelosi asked Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) to assess the mood of the caucus, according to one source. </p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had previously announced that he plans to bring up the DREAM Act during the lame duck session. His spokesman said Wednesday that Reid still hopes to call a vote. </p>
<p>The move by Democratic leaders to put immigration back on the legislative calendar will win support from Latinos, whose strong turnout numbers in the West last week were credited with helping the party hold on to control of the Senate. Immigration advocates have pressed Democrats to move on the DREAM Act as a &#8220;down-payment&#8221; on their promise to push for a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the future. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The DREAM Act provides a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants if they were in the United States before age 16, and if they have been residents for five years before enactment of the law. They would need to attend college for two years or join the military. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The DREAM Act provides a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants if they were in the United States before age 16, and if they have been residents for five years before enactment of the law. They would need to attend college for two years or join the military.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three quick points here:</p>
<p>1.) Anything with a name like the &ldquo;DREAM Act&rdquo; or some other such revolting moniker like a &ldquo;Global Citizenship Declaration,&rdquo; has to be bad, since it at best makes one nauseated and at worst is a precursor of rabid madness;</p>
<p>2.) What is it about the word illegal and its corrosive impact on the word immigrant, that has become lost on these fools;</p>
<p>3.) Finally, since when should a &ldquo;down-payment&rdquo; ever be made on a future bankruptcy.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Just a few of the follies embedded in the proposed DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act): </p>
<p>1) Illegal alien minors brought to the U. S. before age 16 could, on reaching age 21, seek legal status for illegal alien parents, putting in motion the chain migration of extended family. </p>
<p>2) The DREAM Act would be an invitation to fraud: Only an affidavit was required for &#8220;proof&#8221; of minor status on entering the U. S.</p>
<p>3) Illegal aliens up to the age of 29 could apply. </p>
<p>4) Merely filing an application, no matter how far-fetched, confers instant legal status (immunity from deportation). </p>
<p>One can well understand why Democrats would want to push this fraud-prone measure through the Senate in a lame duck session. The DREAM Act would be another powerful reward for breaking U. S. immigration laws, and rewarding illegal entry is about the only thing Democrats can think to do about the matter.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to quibble but the DREAM act states:</p>
<p>H.R. (House Version) 1751 would allow illegal aliens of any age over five (since they have to have been present in the United States for five years) to apply for amnesty, while S. (Senate Version) 729 requires applicants to be under the age of 35. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the amnestied illegals can then petition to have their illegal alien parents (the ones who broke the law in the first place) made citizens.  Then through chain migration they can bring in their relatives.  So ultimately the DREAM Act will provide amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, not just a few hundred thousand teenagers.  </p>
<p>Call up your congressmen on Monday and give them a (polite) earful.  This horrible bill must be stopped.  If you don&rsquo;t do that much, don&rsquo;t complain if it passes.</p>

		<p>Seems we have people in Congress that cannot understand what the word &#8220;NO&#8221; means. We&rsquo;ve told them time and again that we do NOT want any privileges for people who&rsquo;ve laughed at our laws. Pelosi and Reid, the evil twins, would be more than happy to fill this country with third world inhabitants who would follow them like sheep as long as they passed out the freebies. More illegals, more future votes to keep the two bellying up to the public trough for the rest of their miserable lives.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Si se puede!&#8221;  (Yes we can) is a phrase I hear a lot from the gazillions of latino activists I work around.  (Some of them are quite militant in a very unsettling way.)  I have to feign at least minimal support (or lose my job in public education, which is controlled by extreme leftists) and it irks me to no end.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to vote, though I wanted to, this last election, and when I was asked by the latinos I&rsquo;m around if I did, I casually said no.  One of them, an illiterate mexican &#8216;gangero&rsquo; who is overbearing to the max, shouted loudly, &#8220;Why didn&rsquo;t you go and help the latinos?  You&rsquo;re probably a republican.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all eyes on me, I said, &#8220;Oh no, I never support republicans or democrats.  I always vote the environmentalist party.  Save the trees!&#8221;</p>
<p>This got a chuckle out of the gathering crowd while the big mexican was mute and puzzled.  At least the situtation was diffused and I could get back to the fiction of &#8216;educating&rsquo; them.</p>

		<p>Reid threw this sop to pro-illegal Hispanics right before the recess, and he and Pelosi know it&rsquo;s doomed to failure during the lame duck as well.  The fact that they would even dream (pun acknowledged) of bringing this up now should discredit them completely.  Most of America is concerned about the Bush tax rates expiring, and older folks like me want the $250 payment proposed in lieu of a raise in Social Security.  Yet far-left Dems are concerned about illegals, not citizens.  </p>

<p>Although I could very happily live the rest of my life never seeing another Third World immigrant, I can maybe   &mdash;   MAYBE   &mdash;   see some point in allowing military service as a pathway to citizenship. Anybody who&rsquo;s willing to lay down their life for this country deserves SOME sort of reward   &mdash;   regardless of whether the war they&rsquo;re fighting is a &#8220;good&#8221; one or not. </p>
<p>But to offer the military OR COLLEGE is just absurd, because OF COURSE the latter will be the preferred choice for 99% of illegals under the laughably misnamed DREAM Act. Why would ANY of these invaders risk their lives getting shot at in Iraq when instead they can get an affirmative-action degree at some marijuana-scented hot-bed of pro-mestizo, anti-white propaganda that is a typical 21st Century campus&hellip; and STILL get their Green Card and all the other goodies that come with it? </p>

		<p>I keep hearing how the Latino vote saved the democrats out West.  Just how did so many latins become citizens so quickly?  We are told that as many as 30 or more million are illegals.  Did they vote?  DID THEY VOTE?</p>

		<p>There is only one conclusion that any sensible person could make about the four years of Democrat control of the government.  They largely don&rsquo;t want amnesty either.  Think about it.  They had an almost veto proof Senate, numerical superiority in the House and control of the White House.  If they had wanted to they certainly could&rsquo;ve passed &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; and they still can before the changes take place in Congress in January.  This is just a smoke screen.  They&rsquo;re paying lip service to latinos and the sooner these people figure it out the better off we all will be.  Such a stupid move would result in an erosion of the White liberal and black power base within the party, especially blacks.  More than a few people in the black caucus sit in districts vulnerable to hispanic voter influence should these illegals become US citizens.  </p>

		<p>There already is a path to citizenship without the Dream Act. It&rsquo;s called application to enter the country legally, followed by fulfilling all the requirements needed to become a citizen as prescribed by the law. The path for the illegal aliens that entered the country under the age of 16 should only be the path to back where they came from. And their parents too.</p>

		<p>Anon #3,</p>
<p>Thanks for the correction.  My info on a earlier version of the Dream Act. Here is a capsule summary of the DREAM ACT from today&rsquo;s alert from the Federation of Americans for Immigration Reform, which is, along with NumbersUSA, leading the restrictionist cause: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the DREAM Act would create a tiered system of granting amnesty to illegal aliens who entered the U.S. before the age of 16 and had lived here for at least five years.   Under the DREAM Act, illegal aliens who are at least 12 years old, have lived in the U.S. for five years, and are enrolled in primary or secondary school are eligible for a stay of removal.  Going even further, illegal aliens who have obtained a high school diploma or have simply been admitted to an institution of higher education are eligible for conditional legal permanent resident (LPR) status.  If aliens who receive conditional LPR status then complete at least two years of a degree program or two years of military service, they are then eligible for regular LPR status, enabling them to become a U.S. citizen in five years.  Although the Senate version of the Act limits eligibility to aliens younger than 35, the House bill contains no age limit. That said, the most recent Senate bill also provides retroactive benefits to illegal aliens of any age.&#8221;</p>
