<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2129375&amp;nid=111">UK Imposes New Permanent Immigration Quota</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Stringer, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), November 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain will impose a tough annual limit on the number of non-Europeans allowed to work in the U.K. and slash visas for overseas students as it seeks to dramatically reduce immigration, the government said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Theresa May told the House of Commons that the number of non-EU nationals permitted to work in the U.K. from April 2011 will be capped at about 22,000  &mdash;  a reduction of about one-fifth from 2009.</p>
<p>But thousands of people who are allowed to work in Britain on intracompany transfers aren&rsquo;t included in those figures  &mdash;  or under the new quota. Critics said that means it&rsquo;s unclear how Prime Minister David Cameron&rsquo;s government will meet a pledge to cut net immigration, which also includes students and families of visa holders, to below 100,000 by 2015, from about 196,000 last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a member of the European Union, Britain must allow citizens of most other member states freedom to live and work in the U.K.</p>
<p>Business leaders had urged Cameron&rsquo;s government against stringent restrictions on non-European workers, arguing vital sectors would be left short of staff  &mdash;  particularly in health care and for energy infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Indian officials also warned Cameron over restricting the rights of their citizens to study and work in the U.K. during his visit in July.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Labour Party legislator Ed Balls criticized the government for failing to set a limit on intracompany transfers. &#8220;Can she confirm her supposed cap is in fact a con, a guess, a fig leaf, no cap at all?&#8221; he asked May in the Commons.</p>
<p>May&rsquo;s quota will have only a limited impact on Britain&rsquo;s overall immigration rate  &mdash;  as work-related visas account only for about 20 percent of migration.</p>
<p>Families of those with rights to live and work in Britain claim about 20 percent of visas, while non-European students arriving to study in the U.K. account for 60 percent of immigration.</p>

		<p>Sounds like smoke and mirrors.  Even this happens, it would only reduce immigration by not even 50% at the five year point.</p>

<p>Oh, great!  There&rsquo;s no question they&rsquo;re heading for depression, along with the entire Western world, and the fools still want to bring more third world peons into the country.</p>
<p>Ireland is going broke today, Portugal tomorrow and Spain the day after, which means Britain is close behind, waiting it&rsquo;s turn.</p>
<p>How much do they plan to pay them to show their gratitude at having an increase in crime and social costs?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so brilliant, just like our geniuses.</p>

		<p>And we can expect Cameron to ban family reunification immigration, high skill(so-called) immigration and &#8220;refugee&#8221; immigration when? I think it was the Sainted Conservative Winston that opened the doors to the dregs of the Empire, thus undoing whatever he did by dragging England into Total War against fellow Europeans.</p>

		<p>What is needed is a moratorium - with absolutely no exceptions whatsoever imposed on immigration into Britain.<br>
 Furthermore the biggest scam - &#8216;family reunifcation&rsquo; and importation of spouses needs to eliminated.</p>

<p>*** Oh my!  This means that wages for such jibs will go UP, and that there will be more of an incentive for locals to go into those fields.  Imagine that!  </p>
<p>Business &#8216;leaders&rsquo; in every western country are at the forefront of aiding and abetting illegal immigration.  That&rsquo;s why I call for jail time and property confiscation of any businesses that knowingly employ illegals.  </p>

		<p>White immigrants come to UK mainly from other EU countries and they have a right to live and work there without permits. Just like the British can do it in their countries. Some one million British live permanently in Spain. Non European students account for 60% of immigration. So the limits imposed on non-european and non-students group is quite serious. </p>

		<p>3. No Churchill didn&rsquo;t, it was the Labour government that allowed freedom of movement within the Empire and started the catastrophe of post war mass immigration. A catastrophe Winston recognised and fought against. He wanted to campaign on the slogan of &#8216;Keep Britain White&rsquo;, a lone voice I am afraid in the establishment.</p>
