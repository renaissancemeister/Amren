			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Moore, Denver Post, November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper didn&rsquo;t have to wait long Tuesday night to learn he will be Colorado&rsquo;s next governor.</p>
<p>Hickenlooper was projected to have won out over third-party candidate Tom Tancredo and the largely abandoned Republican Dan Maes a little more than an hour after the polls closed.</p>
<p>At 11:30 p.m., Hickenlooper was leading with 50.2 percent of the vote, or 690,697 votes. Tancredo, a former House Republican running on the American Constitution Party ticket, had 37.4 percent, or 514,463 votes; and Maes had 11 percent, or 151,919 votes.</p>
<p>Republicans worried that Tancredo and Maes would split the conservative vote, but Hickenlooper was on pace to garner more votes than his two main challengers combined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taking the stage as the song &#8220;La Bamba&#8221; played, Tancredo thanked more than 300 supporters gathered at the Stampede Mesquite Grill &amp; Dance Emporium in Aurora.</p>
<p>He recalled the start of his candidacy just three months ago and marveled at the money he raised and the support he garnered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still believe to this very day, every step we took was the right step,&#8221; said Tancredo, who raised less than a quarter of what Hickenlooper generated.</p>
<p>And he reminded supporters that &#8220;the loss of a race does not mean the loss of a cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Maes&rsquo; fans expressed anger at the media for what they felt was unfair treatment  &mdash;  and at Tancredo for jumping into the race.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fight starts now,&#8221; said Lana Fore, publisher of the Constitutionalist Today and a Maes supporter. &#8220;The current GOP is going down. We will see to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The initial clear GOP frontrunner, former Congressman Scott McInnis, saw his huge lead over Maes evaporate after he was embroiled in a plagiarism scandal. Tancredo issued an ultimatum to both candidates: Pledge to get out of the race if the winner was trailing Hickenlooper in the polls the day after the primary or Tancredo would get in as the American Constitution Party candidate. They both refused, and Tancredo entered the race at the end of July.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Campaigning against illegal immigration and for states&rsquo; rights, Tancredo filled the candidate vacuum for conservative voters. He spent much of his time on the campaign trail bashing his Democratic opponent and gaining in the polls.<br>

		<p> This one was a heartbreaker. But the mental and moral<br>
decay of our nation has taken 50 years. We cannot turn it<br>
around in 18 months. But Whites are coming awake. White voters<br>
in Colorado and Nevada and California are realizing that<br>
they no longer are the majority, and they no longer<br>
are in control of their destiny. This is what &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;<br>
really means. </p>

		<p>John Ritter is probably kicking himself for not running again.</p>
<p>If Hickenlooper winds up winning with under 50%, which is well possible, then I think this is blood on Dan Maes&rsquo;s hands.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that far too many voters say they don&rsquo;t like illegal immigrants or so much legal immigration and do not want amnesty yet they will vote for a candidate that will support it all. Either Colorado is full of lefty, guilt ridden Whites or the &#8220;hispanics&#8221; legal and illegal voted for this guy. Seems the western part of the country is full of traitors and morons. </p>

		<p>Tom Tancredo will be elected to a higher office one day in the not too distant future.  Things just haven&rsquo;t gotten bad enough.  There isn&rsquo;t enough support for the Constitution Party or any third party as yet but he did an admirable showing nonetheless.<br>

A heartbreaker indeed.</p>
<p>That the Republican party would keep Maes in the race to prevent Tancredo from winning is both spiteful and suicidal. The Republics essentially betrayed their own and handed the election to Hicknlooper.<br>
    <br>
Apparently, for the Republicans, it&rsquo;s better to elect a Democrat than a conservative.</p>
<p>Shame on the Republicans.</p>

		<p>I am a Colororaodan who is DISGUSTED with my state at this moment.<br>
The Republicans who voted for the idiot Maes, because he had a***** &#8220;R&#8221; on his ticket?<br>
Good God!<br>
Now, we have Lickenpooper!<br>
Ahomophile, marxist fool who actually wants to keep marijuana illegal. That&rsquo;s because he is on the payroll of the Mexican drug cartels. <br>
Tancredo wants pot legalized, regulated &amp; taxed.<br>
Yet I saw a pot doctor (BTW, a complete sheister, like a lawyer or a politician, and an utter fraud of a physician, who opposed Tancredo (probably because the pot doc was a flaming gay), and he railed about how medicinal pot had to stay legal&hellip;but he wanted Lickenpooper?<br>
Fools, and idiots, all. <br>
Even Colorado is lost.<br>
Never thought I&rsquo;d see the day&hellip;</p>

		<p>I am not happy with the results of this election.  The polls supposedly showed the race to be a tossup and yet Tancredo only garnered 37% of the vote.  I spent a lot of money supporting Tancredo while I could have been out drinking or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, #1 above has it right.  But the question remains &#8220;are whites ever going to do anything about it?&#8221;</p>

		<p>We must all look at this midterm as a tremendous step forward.  Until now, Tancredo was looked at as a joke.  Now, he&rsquo;s a man who took over 37% of the Colorado gubernatorial vote as a third-party candidate.  The MSM barely mentioned him, as if doing so would conjure up a demon!  Instead, they zeroed in on two very feminine women  &mdash;  Christine O&rsquo;Donnell and Sharron Angle  &mdash;  who, importantly, got 40% and 45% of the votes.  O&rsquo;Donnell did so in a Democratic New England state, where polls show that her primary opponent, RINO Castle, would have also lost to the winner of the general.  Angle was up against the Senate majority leader in a strongly union state.  <br>
We are at the gates!</p>

		<p>What about massive vote fraud? Tancredo was supposed to be running neck and neck with this guy. Ditto for Nevada, where Sharron Angle was actually supposed to be ahead by about four points in the polls.</p>

		<p>Yes, the worst disappointment of the day - Tancredo is great.</p>
<p>A lesson that must be learned here is that Americans are still stuck with the cursed two party system and we have to learn to play within this system, play to win.</p>
<p>It looks like at least 10% of a Colorado or most state&rsquo;s voting population will vote GOP out of habit - these are probably old voters who have fallen in to ruts.</p>
<p>All should remember that most of the US South voted Democrat for 100 years after the US Civil War and Reconstruction - these White &#8220;Yellow Dog Democrats&#8221; were still voting straight Democrat well in to the late 1960s when everything had changed and the national Democrat party had become the anti White party.</p>
<p>And we should also understand that we here on Amren are part of a 1-3% elite who are deeply involved in racial, cultural issues/activism - most White Americans just aren&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t want to think about politics all the time. These folks aren&rsquo;t up for third party challenges to the system.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan should have run for governor as a Republican&hellip; AND WON, instead of being talked in to running for President of the United States on the Reform Party ticket and winning what, less than 2%.</p>

<p>You are correct on both counts. Traditional Coloradans have been displaced by fleeing Californians, tech professionals, and illegal south-of-the border invaders since the early 1990&rsquo;s. Western libertarians and conservatives have been rapidly losing political influence statewide. </p>
<p>There has been a large Hispanic population in Colorado for centuries, but they are largely descendants of Spaniards, sharing more in common with old stock frontiersman and have no particular love for, nor allegiance with Mexicans and other illegal aliens.</p>
<p>The fact that Tom Tancredo can gain 37% while his republican challenger can pick up another 11% of the vote from a state that has been over overrun with SWPL, NPR yuppies, alien benefactors of the 1987 amnesty legislation, and invaders in a state that Obama won by a significant margin means quite a few whites woke up.       </p>

		<p>The people who fled California after wrecking the place are now doing the same thing to Colorado.  Repeating a behavior that has been shown to be destructive while expecting a different result is the height of insanity.  Is there any way we could confine these folks in mental institutions?</p>

		<p>To poster number 5 (sbuffalonative) - Yes, the Republican Party is definitely despicable.  Tancredo was a former Republican, and when it comes to issues, he&rsquo;s a lot closer to the Republicans than the Democrats.  So, the Republicans clearly showed their disregard for the people and their spitefulness towards dissenters by allowing Maes to run, even after seeing that Tancredo would be taking nearly all the conservative votes.</p>
<p>To poster number 9 (Uniculturalist) - I must admit I suspect voter fraud as well.  The news about aliens in Washington campaigning for that liberal trash Murray proved to me that Democrats are not above dirty electoral tactics.  The polls, which I watched closely on the O-Reilley Factor in the days preceding the elections, did show Angle up about four or five points the day before election night.  And since those polls are usually very accurate, I find it fishy that Reid actually won by a few points. </p>
<p>To poster number 10 (jack ryan) - I just recently finished Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s &#8220;Death of the West,&#8221; and I am about half way through &#8220;Day of Reckoning.&#8221;  Though he does not seem to be against miscegenation and is against segregation, he does agree with our views on nearly every issue, from immigration (illegal and legal alike), to demographic change, to involvement in neo-con wars, the UN, and NATO, the Confederate flag, and even the Civil Rights era (he called MLK a radical and said he identifies his views towards blacks with the more conservative black activists, such as Martin Luther King SR. and Booker T. Washington, who both advocated &#8220;seperate but equal&#8221; policies).  He would have made an excellant candidate indeed, and you&rsquo;re right, he should have started with something small like a governorship (preferably even smaller, like a seat in the House of Representatives) and worked his way up.  </p>
<p>Tancredo&rsquo;s excellent showing in Colorado does give me quite a lot of hope that this nation can, and eventually will, be saved.  His views on marijuana were a shocker but with his focus on immigration - the single greatest threat to our nation&rsquo;s survival - I couldn&rsquo;t care less right now.</p>

		<p>I still believe this vote was fixed, precisely because Tancredo is the man liberals &#8216;most like to hate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When polls A day BEFORE the election say he&rsquo;s tied with the &#8216;Hick&rsquo;, and then the RESULTS say he ONLY got 35% of the vote?</p>
<p>As in 2000, 2004, and most likely 2008, vote fraud is now the norm for the NWO types. But, I learned a lesson. ALL of he candidates I sent money to, LOST. Not because they were not good, decent, and even worthy of &#8216;change&rsquo;, but because the elections were FIXED. I KNOW it. Fixed either at the ballot box, or by legitimizing those who are not citizens of this country being given a ballot, and some nachos.</p>
<p>My money is hereafter going to my rural farm retreat in an all white state. I&rsquo;m done with this charade called the American political system, and the multicultural hellholes called &#8216;major metropolitan areas. I&rsquo;m taking care of my own, my race, and my family. The Government can go to hell&hellip;.oh, wait. It already has.</p>
