<h1><a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Mark-Kirk-Re-Segregates-the-Senate-110975684.html?dr">How Mark Kirk Re-Segregates the Senate</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edward McClelland, WMAQ-TV (Chicago), November 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Mark Kirk is sworn in this afternoon, the U.S. Senate will once again have no African-Americans.</p>
<p>Since Reconstruction, there have only been four black senators. Three of them  &mdash;  Carol Moseley Braun, Barack Obama and Roland Burris  &mdash;  have held the seat that Kirk is about to occupy.</p>
<p>For reasons that go back more than a century, all the way to the First Great Migration from the South, Illinois has led the nation in black political empowerment. We&rsquo;ve elected more black statewide officials than anyone else. We produced the first black president. And it was a matter of pride among many Illinoisans that we kept the Senate integrated. In 2004, we picked such a great black senator that he went on to integrate the presidency.</p>
<p>This is no slur against Kirk. It&rsquo;s not a slur against Illinois, either. It shouldn&rsquo;t be our responsibility to provide a black senator. It&rsquo;s a slur against the other 49 states, who refuse to elect a black politician to the U.S. Senate. African-Americans make up 12 percent of this country&rsquo;s population. Their presence in America goes back nearly 400 years  &mdash;  &#147;Before the Mayflower,&#8221; as the title of a history of black America puts. Yet after 4 p.m. today, African-Americans will make up 0 percent of the nation&rsquo;s most prestigious elective body. That&rsquo;s disgraceful.</p>

		<p>I contacted the author of the above story at the following email address:  tedmcclelland@gmail.com </p>
<p>I sent the following response to him and am including it here, not because I think it is exceptional in any way, because it isn&rsquo;t, but to show that some of us on this site want people like this journalist to know that their thinking is skewed and biased.  The email nust have irritated him, because I noticed just now that his email address has been removed.  It must have been a shock to him to get an email that criticized him, since he&rsquo;s probably used to getting applause and accolades in Chicago proper for his sick bias towards blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;No blacks in the Senate is a good thing.  Do you realize what the mindset is of the general population outside the Chicago area?<br>
 <br>
&#8220;I&rsquo;ll tell you.  We believe that blacks are a huge problem in this country, not only for their obvious lack of intelligence but because their crime figures are higher than any other racial group.  And that extends throughout the world, not just in this country.  They are but 12% of the population, yet commit 58% of ALL violent crime.  (FBI Uniform Crime Report; US Dept. of Justice.) They have the added distinction of raping, on average, 37, 500 white women per year, with the reverse almost nil.   Also, their crime rates are higher than any other group in the entire Western world.  <br>
 <br>
Thousands of tests from every Western country in the world reveal that blacks CANNOT compete in a first world country.  Group I.Q. in Africa is 70.  Here in the US it is supposed to be about 85, but that figure has been inflated due to the constant harping by the black leadership that claim tests are biased against blacks, who tacitly threaten to riot if they are not appeased.   Black women score slightly higher&hellip;on average&hellip;than black men.  So, to be charitable, let&rsquo;s say that black males in the US score&hellip;on average&hellip;.as a group, about 80 on I.Q. tests.  No group in the world can compete in a civilized society with an average group I.Q. that low.  It&rsquo;s frightening to know they are being allotted AA positions in vital professions, like the medical field, with I.Q.&rsquo;s so low.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Not having these pitifully moronic beings in government prevents a lot of chaos and disharmony there, because they cry and wail uncontrollably, placing the blame for their failures on racism or oppression, when obviously it is their own lack of intelligence and abilities that are at fault.  Too, do we need more in Congress who believe putting too many people on one side of an island will cause it to tip over like a raft?<br>
 <br>
&#8220;They are also locked into a black mindset.  They concern themselves, not with the country as a whole, but only blacks and black interests.  And this attitude embraces blacks anywhere they might be.  They&rsquo;re not only the least intelligent people on earth, they&rsquo;re the most biased and prone to crime and violence.    Sorry, old boy, but it&rsquo;s time somebody broke the news to you.  That way you won&rsquo;t be thrashing around hysterically decrying a lack of representation by an evil segment of the population that is no more than haters of whites and America.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;After Jeremiah Wright and his racist church with the black Jesus (because they can&rsquo;t stand the thought of a Jesus OTHER than black), not many of us are fooled any more about the vast number of white haters throughout the black community all over the country.  Too, we sit, listen and watch, and we realize they pursue only those things that are of interest to blacks anywhere in the world, over their non-black countrymen. <br>
 <br>
The community organizer worked diligently for years in a black racist church and the surrounding white-hating communities doing everything possible, by hook or crook, to elevate blacks somehow, because they lack the ability to succeed on their own.  It&rsquo;s preposterous to believe that this evil man wanted to be president for any reason other than to favor blacks someway, which is now revealed in his policies, and  his selection of unqualified blacks in various positions.<br>
 <br>
Blacks are the curse of the entire Western world, to say nothing of their failure rate in Africa.  They represent one of the greatest problems the Western world has.  And, as a self-hating white, you add to that problem. <br>

		<p>Burris is mentally retarded, as his actions and words in the past several years clearly show.  If he were Asian, Syrian, or white, I would make the same comment. Retarded people should nolt decide anything of importance that affects anyone other than their own family. I could care less if this offends &#8220;challenged&#8221; advocates. We are tired of supporting retarded people, pretending they are able to do anything useful. and being taxed for costs that should be born by the brainlees families that in this day and age should have made a decisionh to deprive us of the &#8220;honor&#8221; of their presence in our society.

		<p> So the Senate will have no black members again starting in 2011? How too, too bad. Boo-hoo! Both Carol Mostly-Brown   &mdash;   I mean Moseley-Braun   &mdash;   and Obama managed to sneak in under unusual circumstances. Moseley-Braun was sent packing after one term; Obama didn&rsquo;t even stay long enough to get his seat warm before he began lusting after the presidency. And no, Mr. McClelland, neither was a &#8220;great&#8221; senator. Roland Burris has had his own ethics questions which have gained him notoriety rather than fame.</p>
<p> Perhaps the reason that other states have not voted in black senators is that, for the most part, black politicians tend to be flaming, foaming-at-the-mouth liberals. Much harder to get one of them into office when they have to appeal to a whole state, than when they&rsquo;re running in one of the tailor-made, welfare-haven inner city black districts.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have a horse in this race, as an Illinois resident (only for a month more, anyway).  They can keep Mark Kirk.  I didn&rsquo;t vote for him, he might as well be a Democrat, and would be in any other state except this one is so out of whack in terms of its body politic that someone like Kirk has to be a &#8220;Republican.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Illinois has led the nation in black political empowerment. We&rsquo;ve elected more black statewide officials than anyone else. We produced the first black president.

<p>And how&rsquo;s that working out for you?  Illinois has to be about the most corrupt state in the country.  And believe me, if not for Chicago and Cook County, none of those black statewide office holders would have never won.</p>

<p>Of course not Comrade McClelland, of course not!</p>
<p>But since you have so eagerly slandered those other 49 states, perhaps you could explain 3 things to me.</p>
<p>1.) Why has Illinois not managed to land blacks on the moon and &ldquo;integrate&rdquo; it;</p>
<p>2.) Why has not Illinois managed to also elect Asians and Hispanics to the US Senate simultaneously with blacks, regardless of the two seat minimum;</p>
<p>3.) And finally, do you honestly think that your state&rsquo;s achievements on these scores so far realized, are really something to brag about?</p>
<p>Carol Moseley Braun and Barack Obama, indeed?</p>
<p>That is like taking credit for the last Ice Age!</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s &#8220;disgraceful&#8221; is that someone under the cover of respectable journalism can call the results of a fair and honest election &#8220;re-segregation&#8221; simply because a white candidate won.  Notice to Mr. McClelland:  The voters of Illinois have spoken.  They preferred Mark Kirk as their next Senator.  Barack Obama/Roland Burris&rsquo; seat is not a &#8220;black seat&#8221; in perpetuity.   </p>

		<p>Note the obsession with counting how many people of a given race are in the Senate.  If this was a monoracial society the media might actually focus on what matters   &mdash;   what are the positions of the politicians and will they uphold the U.S. Constitution?  But instead, in a multiracial society the media obsesses over racial representation so the important things go by the wayside.  That is another (and very important) weakness of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>If Elizabeth Wright of Issues and Views runs for the Senate I&rsquo;ll vote for her.  Damn few other blacks, and not very many whites, are worth my vote.<br>

		<p>McClelland is one of those pasty-faced writers who has this strange contempt for people of his own skin color and a reverence and sense of awe for Africans.</p>
<p>The seat that moderate Reopublican Mark Kirk now holds is THE PEOPLE&rsquo;S SEAT.  It&rsquo;s not Barry boy&rsquo;s seat, Carol Mostly Fraud&rsquo;s, or that of the midget-brained sycophant Burris. </p>
<p>McClelland says that the US Senate returning to all-White status is &#8220;disgraceful&#8221;.  He&rsquo;s dead wrong.  As a life-long resident of Illinois, I can tell you that what was disgraceful were the pitiful performances of the three aforementioned Africans.  </p>

<p>Typical black innumeracy and lack of logic: since the country is 12% black, the Senate should be 12% black or it&rsquo;s racist!</p>
<p>But each state is represented by 2 Senators, usually elected one at a time.  Each voter only gets to vote for one Senator in any election year.  Therefore <b><i>zero</i></b> Senators will be black (if voters vote by race) unless one of the 50 states has more than a 50% black electorate.  </p>
<p>No state is going to have a voter turnout in a Senate Election that is 50%+ black with the rise of the Hispanics, either.  Whites may vote for blacks, but Hispanics want those offices for their own people.  </p>
<p>Whites were generous enough to vote for 3 black (incompetent) Senators in Illinois.  Where is the gratitude?  <br>

		<p>Well if one group is underrepresented it follows necessarily that some other group is overrepresented. Jews make up less than 2% of the US population but 13% of the Senate. All 13 of them are Democrats. Since Democrats obsess so about underepresentation of minorities, and since blacks are underrepresented and are Democrats, and since Jews are overrepresented and are Democrats, I have a modest proposal in mind. 11 of the Jewish senators can step down under the condition they be replaced by blacks.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time political positions be based on race percentages. If Africans make up 12% of the population then let them occupy 12 seats, Hispanics 13 or 14 seats, whites 65 seats, Jews 2 seats, and so on.  We need this kind of legislation passed quickly. No one will cry foul-it will create a balance. There is only one group of people who will cry foul to this idea and you can guess what letter it starts with. Hint: Capital J. </p>

<p>NO BLACK nor Hispanic, etc. should ever hold any office in this country, whether it be city, county, State or Fed. They should never have any control over White America, period. Until Whites face that fact, they are not EVER going to have self-rule or anything resembling the Constitution whatsoever! The Constitution was NEVER set up for blacks or any other minority in this country.</p>
<p> WHY do you think the Constitution is being shredded as we speak and has been falsely interpreted for decades now and they call it a &#8220;living&#8221; Constitution to change with the PC times? Isn&rsquo;t it OBVIOUS as to the why by now to most White people and even the WN among us?</p>
<p> Even people like Mark Levin should know better since he claims to be an expert on the Constitution, yet he dare NEVER mention the fact that it is a White man&rsquo;s Constitution set up for Whites ONLY!</p>

		<p>Who wrote this insane article? The author&rsquo;s an idiot. Maybe he should be the next Senator from Illinois - carrying on in the tradition of those great lawmakers like Roland Burris and Carol Mosley-Braun. He&rsquo;d fit right in. </p>
<p>As you can see, Illinois is in fine shape - billions in the red, high taxes, 50+ shootings a week in Chicago alone - thanks to the grinning trio of dimwits - Roland, Barak, and Carol.</p>
<p>A senator should be wise and represent all the people of his or her state. Demanding a black be elected simply because of color basically trashes the wise and representative components.</p>
<p>Lastly, &#8220;Before the Mayflower&#8221;? Give me a break! It&rsquo;s ironic that history is being rewritten by people who never developed a written language. How is this <br>
possible?    </p>

		<p>I agree, it&rsquo;s our fault in every state that we haven&rsquo;t gone out and FOUND a black candidate to write in. I mean, we should know better than to vote for the candidates that are put in front of us! Now, let&rsquo;s work on the Congress.</p>
