	<p>We know sugar is bad for you. But now a new study shows that it is even worse for many Latinos. A new study out of USC find that Latinos are genetically predisposed to have increased liver fat when they eat sugar, Dr. Bruce Hensel reported. </p>
<p>Rosa Angel got a good look at her liver recently and it wasn&rsquo;t a pretty picture. &#8220;My fat, is very fat on my liver. Its 26 % fat, which is very high,&#8221; she said. Rosa has a genetic variation that makes it harder for her liver to break down fat especially when she eats a lot of sugar. Research shows that 49% of Latinos have this gene variation. Its all part of a study from the USC Keck School of Medicine. </p>
<p>Jaimie Davis, Ph.D., is one of the researchers. &#8220;It could lead to a direct accumulation of fat in the liver. They may not be able to break it down as efficiently. Diets high in sugar could be leading directly to this fatty liver disease,&#8221; Davis said. This accumulation can lead to fatty liver disease or even cirrosis of the liver.And it is especially worrying in children. When researchers tested more than 300 Latino youth 8 to 18 in the East and Central Los Angeles area  they found that a third of the youth had fatty livers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re seeing high amounts of fat in these children, much like if they were alcoholics. And when doctors first saw this fat in the liver, they questioned parents if these kids were drinking alcohol. Which they weren&rsquo;t,&#8221; Davis said. </p>
<p>The main culprit is sugary beverages. More than 40% of the sugar in the Latino children&rsquo;s diets come from sugary drinks. And not only that, the sugar that is in beverages such as soda and some juices are from high fructose corn syrup, which goes straight to the liver for breakdown. So not only does the highest amount of sugar comes from sugar sweetened beverages, but the type of sugar may also be detrimental. </p>

		<p>They do love their mango drinks and beer.  Should we be giving it away to them?  Would we save money in the longrun?  Sure, but medicaid and Obamacare will pick them up and a few tangy beverages will cost us billions. </p>
<p>Of course their beers cost us plenty now in higher insurance and highway death/injuries. </p>
<p>OK. Then just serve water in the public schools. Maybe they&rsquo;ll leave, deprived of the ample machines of Mountain Dew and juice at their subsidized &#8220;school lunch&#8221; (and breakfast, and after school)since we can&rsquo;t legally toss non-citizens from our schools, according to the Supremes, and save a few billion that way. </p>
<p>Look, we have to be creative. The current efforts to keep them out of our schools, hospitals and public welfare programs aren&rsquo;t working!</p>

		<p>Hispanics are partly American Indian.  Agriculture originated about five thousand years ago in the New World, and about ten thousand years ago in the Old World.  With agriculture there is more consumption of grains and beans, and less of meat.  In time the digestive system evolved in order to digest carbohydrates better, but this took time.  <br>
 <br>
American Indians are also more likely to suffer from diabetes. <br>
 <br>
As a related problem, they are more likely to suffer from alcoholism, because they were more recently introduced to alcohol, and the alcohol they were introduced to was distilled liquor. Before being exposed to gin, brandy, whiskey, and vodka, Europeans had had more than a thousand years of exposure to wine and beer. <br>
 <br>
In his Gallic Wars Julius Caesar described the problems the ancient German tribesmen had with wine.  These resemble problems American Indians still have, although not the problems most contemporary Germanic peoples have, because Germanics with alcoholism genes have tended to be removed from the Germanic gene pool   <br>
 <br>
The human races have evolved in response to different population pressures.  This explains different health problems.  It also explains different average ability levels, personalities, and characters. It is unfortunate that these differences cannot usually be discussed calmly and rationally.    </p>

		<p>Just today at my day job I was required to take a brief online training course related to health insurance and non-English speakers in California State law. One state law mandates that insurance companies keep racial data on all of their members. I thought race was a &#8216;social construct&rsquo;? As usual race exists when it benefits minorities, but becomes a social construct when it benefits Whites.</p>

		<p>Just what is a &#8220;Latino&#8221;?  Genetically speaking, I mean.</p>
<p>Well, this report is from Los Angeles, so they probably mean Mexicans, which means mestizos. And that means a lot of Amerindian genes.  I have read that the latter  (at least some desert tribes in Arizona, such as  Pimas) are not able to handle sugar and fats (as with alcohol) since they are not used to metabolizing it, and they do tend to become grossly overweight from a  &#8220;civilized&#8221; diet (ie. fatty, sugary junk foods). <br>
 <br>
Who says there is no difference between races?</p>

		<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s the SIMPLE carbohydrates &#8216;we&rsquo; Native Americans can&rsquo;t handle.  I have enough Native American in me that it&rsquo;s really a problem.  No candy, no Pasteurized Fruit Juice, no Alcohol&hellip;No Gummy Vitamins.  I can&rsquo;t even have cheap Pasta Sauce, or Canned Soup, because they&rsquo;re full of Sugar.  </p>
<p>On the bright side, I&rsquo;m not an ounce overweight, because the Sugar thing forces me to micromanage my diet.  Didn&rsquo;t know about the Liver Fat danger, though.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the article defined &#8216;Latino&rsquo;.  Do the Native Americans and Spanish Jews in my background make me a &#8216;Latino&rsquo;?  Or do they mean something else?  They really should tell us which component of &#8216;Latino&rsquo; imparts the problem with Sugar.</p>
<p>In any event, we keep a freezer stocked with Buckwheat Groats, Rolled Oats, Millet, Rye Flakes, Barley Flakes, Quinoa and Amaranth. And I make raw sauces from fresh fruits and vegetables. Complex Carbohydrates and unheated oils keep me on an even keel.  There are benefits, of course, but I do envy you pure Europeans, in your ability to eat or drink pretty much anything.</p>
<p>Another reason, I think, why European Stock should remain pure and undiluted.</p>

		<p>This problem is the result of racist white doctors, not genetics or dietary habits. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, then you&rsquo;re a racist too!</p>
<p>I went to college, so I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

		<p>Hm&hellip;a family I lived with in Mexico would tell me often that sugar was good for me, and that I needed sugar. They seemed to think I was missing an essential nutrient by avoiding it.</p>
