			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Lilley, Toronto Sun, Nov. 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Forget changing whether we take more family immigrants or skilled workers, a new poll shows Canadians want to shake up the selection of countries from which we select immigrants.</p>
<p>A Leger Marking poll of 1,503 Canadians found that 40% of Canadians say the government should limit immigrants from certain countries in order to change the mix of immigrants coming to Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quebec and Ontario are really looking for a different mix,&#8221; said Dave Scholz, vice-president of Leger.</p>
<p>Quebecers were most likely to agree with the statement that &#8220;Canada should limit immigrants from certain countries to provide a more balanced mix of new immigrants to Canada,&#8221; with 35%.</p>
<p>Just 25% of Albertans felt the same way.</p>
<p>In Ontario, 29% agreed with limiting immigrants from some countries in order to balance the mix but Ontarians were most likely to say that &#8220;Canada should ban immigrants from some countries that are over-represented in our country to allow other immigrants from other countries a chance to have more access,&#8221; with 14% agreeing with the statement.</p>
<p>The most popular option nationally Â¬ at 39%  &mdash;  was that an immigrant&rsquo;s country of origin should have no bearing on whether they should be allowed to come to Canada.</p>
<p>Albertans were most likely to agree with this, at 46%, while Quebecers were the least likely to agree, at 33%.</p>
<p>In 2009, close to one-third of all new immigrants to Canada came from just three countries  &mdash;  China (29,049), Phillipines (27,277) and India (26,122).</p>
<p>The fourth-place country was the United States, with just 9,723 people crossing the 49th parallel.</p>
<p>Leger did the polling online from Nov. 1-4, 2010. The company polled 1,503 Canadians 18 or older. A telephone poll of this size would have a margin of error of +/- 2.6%.<br>

		<p>What?  They&rsquo;re not happy enough with the various kinds of Asians?  (Or the Jamaicans and Haitians?)</p>
<p>Are those white liberals SO RACIST that they cannot tell Asians apart and just lump them all together?</p>
<p>Do those elitists think that the Asians are stuck up for not wanting to mix and they hope bringing in nepalise, Zambians, Hutus and Berbers will give them the &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; cultural experience they feel they&rsquo;re not getting from the Chinese and Indians?</p>
<p>Tsk.  Tsk. Tsk.</p>
<p>All you will do is increase your crime rate and social dissonance.  You can mix up the races in any combination you want.  It won&rsquo;t make your life any better and will probably make it worse.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 2009, close to one-third of all new immigrants to Canada came from just three countries &mdash; China (29,049), Phillipines (27,277) and India (26,122).&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
So a country with only ONE-TENTH the pop&rsquo;n of the USA is getting almost 100,000 immigrants EVERY YEAR strictly from a trio of nonwhite Third World countries from which immigration was virtually BANNED as recently as 1964. </p>
<p>And, pray tell, how many immigrants is Canada accepting these days from her mother countries of Great Britain and France? </p>
<p>And how many from Canada&rsquo;s other traditional European immigration suppliers, such as Ireland, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, the Ukraine, or Eastern Europe?</p>
<p>Since 1965, the answer has been &#8220;Pretty close to zero.&#8221; </p>

		<p>These results correspond to the propaganda that whites have been digesting for the past 40 years - that multiculturalism is like building a pizza &#8216;with everything on it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In entertainment media, news, and advertising, a harmonious optimum number of Asians, blacks, whites, males and females are rigourously portrayed, like a snapshot of the Star Trek crew.</p>
<p>If you poll whites who view the world according to the bias of marketing, have never been inside an ethnic enclave, and are steeped in the lies of &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo;, they will choose &#8220;multicultural equality&#8221; because they&rsquo;ve been conditioned to. </p>

		<p>Where do they find these people to form these &#8220;polls&#8221;? Are most White Canadians that stupid? Like most White Americans seem to be? They should be talking about NO 3rd world immigration period, and to return most of those that have come from these Asian countries! </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t White people wake up to the fact that there is a deliberate plan to genocide Whites all over the world through invasion and miscegenation? It is in PLAIN VIEW! Have they been so beaten down by PC and laws that punish only us (hate/speech and thought crimes)? Are we just going to go out with a whimper and on our knees as some would love us to do? A sad commentary to what we have evolved into.</p>

		<p>If you won&rsquo;t assimilate by breeding because you know your child will be less appealing to remainder whites you want to live with -no matter how smart s/he is- then you have to realize that every importation of non-assimilable ethnies is an admission by your own government that they prefer to cut you a smaller and smaller slice of the GDP pie.</p>
<p>Until you have none.</p>
<p>It is so simple.  I cannot understand why people who live and breed white in honest recognition of their genetic instincts refuse to wake up and -on a simple preferential privileged basis- give their kids the same right they reserved for themselves.</p>
<p>Not just genetically but by productive SES.</p>
<p>Take whites from South Africa.  Take whites from Europe.  If you&rsquo;re desperate, take whites from your Southern Neighbor&hellip;:-]</p>
<p>But for pities sake people, take _whites_.</p>
<p>We are less than 10% of the planetary population now.  We have -always- had the greater degrees of responsibility for environment, resource sustainment and future planning for population management than any other racial population groups.</p>
<p>Including East Asia where all these supposedly smart people live cheek by jowl in positively primitive conditions.  Do we not deserve a homeland like they have and have ruined for themselves?</p>
<p>WAKE UP WHITES!</p>
<p>Wake Up.</p>
<p>Or it will be too late to -get up-.  Off your knees.</p>

		<p>The actual financial burden just to matriculate, accomodate, and include higher numbers of immigrants from more disparate locations is something that no one seems to take into consideration.  The cost of accomodating all these languages, and cultures and provide them with services, representation, health care, etc., represents administrative costs and efforts that I believe will break all modern governments and cause their collapse.  That will be the day that &#8220;the $^!+ hits the fan,&#8221; as it is said.</p>

		<p>The American armed forces are on the Chinese frontier in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>By stationing over a million of their nationals in Canada, the Chinese are answering with an extremely cost-effective strategic response to their main adversary. </p>
<p>It could be that America is putting pressure on Canada to wise up.</p>

		<p>#2 says &#8220;<i>So a country with only ONE-TENTH the pop&rsquo;n of the USA is getting almost 100,000 immigrants EVERY YEAR&hellip;..</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Canada receives about 250,000 <i>legal</i> immigrants every year, plus thousands of bogus &#8220;refugees&#8221;, plus temporary workers, plus foreign students, plus illegal aliens, etc. etc. which totals about 400,000 incoming people annually.</p>
<p>Aside from Canada committing racial suicide with vast numbers of NON-white immigrants flooding into our country, note what this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u-mihtgTm0&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow">Swedish government sponsored video</a> is promoting for <i>their</i> indigenous white natives.    </p>

		<p>Canadians, like Americans, Britons, Australians, etc, were never asked if they wanted the dramatic demographic racial changes that have swept through their nations. In every case the answer would have been NO. In every case the betraying party was the one of the left and socialism-marxism (Liberal party in Canada, Democrats in America and Labour for the U.K. and Australia). The pattern is remarkably similar throughout the entire White world. Somebody has an agenda for us and its bad.</p>

		<p>I notice China and India are also top two countries with highest population on the planet.</p>
<p>In Canada, medical care has always been provided to all Canadian citizens and legal landed immigrants but I did hear it is becoming more and more difficult to provide free healthcare nowadays.  One of the clear proofs is, the tests performed by optometrists had always been free for all citizens and immigrants in Canada, but about three years ago, they changed the law and it now costs 75 dollars per session.    </p>
<p>Just like another person mentioned, Canada&rsquo;s poulation is only slightly more than a tenth of the overall population in USA.</p>
<p>One of reasons Canada accepts immigration is to support the domestic economic cycle&hellip;.  create a source of the tax revenue, and help create and sustain a sufficient amount of demand for all productions in the country&hellip;.  </p>
<p>and once you get out of well-known cities in Canada (the cities with NHL franchises in) you will see very few non-whites.   </p>
<p>However, whenever I hear from whites who live outside well-known cities in Canada, they all would rather live in metropolitan cities in Canada&hellip; especially people below the age of 30.  </p>

		<p>I have had enough of Toronto by the way&hellip;  I agree with AmReners.  Toronto is no longer a livable city&hellip;  Nobody does anything or says a thing when third world immigrants or blacks commit crimes.  International students started avoiding Toronto and University of Toronto as their destinations as well.  Not only is the city nasty, but also, there are too many immigrants who can speak their mother language in the city and they will have trouble learning English if they study in Toronto</p>
<p>Of course, I will gladly visit Toronto every now and then, and of course there are wonderful aspects to the city of Toronto, and I will forever remember the wonderful moments I spent in the city, but I feel it is time for me to try a different city.  </p>

		<p>These &#8220;polls&#8221; are a joke.  Like someone else already mentioned, why no polls asking whether participants agree with immigration in the first place or if it should be continued?  Instead, polls are designed only to ask participants what flavor of immigrants they prefer, akin to asking the condemned whether they prefer strawberry or vanilla flavored poison for their execution. Also notice how this strategy is used throughout the 1st world, using language about the &#8220;inevitability&#8221; of multiculturalism and how whites must be &#8220;prepared&#8221; for it.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get mad at us White Canadians and tell us to wake up (Anonymous). The fact is that most of us don&rsquo;t want any more multicultural, non-White immigration either, but if you speak out you are ignored or worse labeled as a hate monger and are in jeopardy of losing your job or being jailed (see Ernst Zundel case). We simply no longer have freedom of speech here in the once great white north. Canada has become brain washed by the left and can&rsquo;t see past it&rsquo;s distorted view of what was once a great country.  </p>

		<p>I wondered about the results of that poll. It sounded fishy since every Canadian I speak to despises the flood of non-Whites we have been subjected to by our treasonous governments. Now I know PART of the answer. 20% of the &#8220;Canadian&#8221; respondents asked in the poll were &#8220;New Canadians&#8221; (code-speak for non-White foreigner). That&rsquo;s a really unbiased poll - asking immigrants what Canadians think about immigrants! (See Norma Greenaway in the NATIONAL POST).</p>

<p>I agree with you. Just like in America, Whites can no longer speak out and defend their own country or people. WE NEVER were asked if we wanted 3rd worlders to come here in the first place. Since 1965 that immigration act along with hate crime laws have all but decimated and neutered the White race. Somehow we HAVE to reverse all of it!  Or we will die off or be miscegenated into the brown/black masses. The same people that rule America also rule Canada and all of Europe.</p>
