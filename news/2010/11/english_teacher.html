			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Lee, Korea Herald, Nov. 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of Korea&rsquo;s biggest foreign English teacher associations is taking an enlightened approach against the fight on mandatory HIV testing by correcting, rather than complaining about, the public&rsquo;s image of English teachers as promiscuous party animals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>National Communications Officer Rob Ouwehand of the Association of Teachers of English in Korea believes that the regulatory testing stems from both the fear of English teachers and HIV, both of which can be cured with knowledge.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Korea Herald, Ouwehand explained that rather than criticize the ministries and third party organizations involved, they look to themselves to polish the tarnished image of foreign English teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;ATEK prefers taking a problem-solving approach to that kind of a question, where rather than complaining about some perceived injustice, why don&rsquo;t we get to work on improving the reputation of English teachers in Korea, by going out into the community and doing good stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>And knowledge of English teachers is exactly what the association plans to distribute through several positive means which includes building internal pressure, connecting with Korean English teachers and rebuilding the Korean public&rsquo;s view of foreign teachers.</p>
<p>To reconnect with the public, Ouwehand believes they need to put themselves out there, swapping scary thoughts of English teachers with positive images.</p>
<p>The perceived reputation of foreign English teachers in Korea, fueled by the Anti-English Spectrum group and perpetuated by the media, had long been one of drinking, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and disease.</p>
<p>It is speculated that the efforts of the vigilante group helped push the ministry&rsquo;s institutionalization of the testing in 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not so much English teachers, it&rsquo;s the idea of English teachers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When English teachers go out into the community and volunteer, collect clothes for poor kids and volunteer English lessons at the orphanage nearby, than instead of being that kind of faceless, scary, English teacher, it humanizes us and by contributing to Korean society and saying we&rsquo;re not here just to drink and party and take our money and go home. We&rsquo;re part of Korean society, and we want to be responsible members and contributors to Korean society.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Korean government has already been working hard to promote the idea that Korea is a multicultural country and as they promote the idea that we can live together and understand each other, once again, that&rsquo;s building the knowledge that will replace fear,&#8221; said Ouwehand.</p>

		<p>Kind of a funny story here.  But I have to say, that South Korea is a sovereign nation, and that it doesn&rsquo;t need to accept foreigners, even if they are whites.  If only others would afford us the same respect.  </p>

<p>For the Koreans sake, I hope not.  This sounds like something only a liberal white could say, and a little investigation finds that that is the case.  I suggest the Koreans deport him immediately, while they still have a country left.</p>

		<p>I don`t know if anybody else is a fan but there was a recent Locked Up Abroad episode about an English teacher in Korea who decides to make some extra cash by smuggling in Hashish from the Phillipines. In fact, I think more than one episode has dealt with ex-pat English teachers not making it and turning to drugs to get the go home money.<br>
  The other mules are invariably duped, coerced and/or blackmailed into doing it by organized gangs. Which made me more sympathetic to their plight. But in the final act it`s always them that cross the white line with the suitcase no matter the reason.</p>

		<p>I HOPE those Koreans remember that there are now hundreds of thousands of Koreans living all over the English speaking world, mostly in New York, California and Canada.</p>
<p>If we can be so accomodating, the least they can do is put up with a few hundred of (yes, most probably) drunken young (liberal) English teachers.</p>
<p>Most of the foreign englias teachers all over the world are young and liberal.  Very liberal.  Those drug addicted loser liberals.</p>
<p>Besides, there&rsquo;s plenty of srunken Koreans here in the States, who are notorius for being wife-beaters.  In addition, Koreans ABSOLUTELY CANNOT DRIVE PROPERLY and cause innumerable accidents on our roads each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Korean government has already been working hard to promote the idea that Korea is a multicultural country&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>We have a few million Mexicans we could send you to help that process along.</p>

		<p>I work as an English teacher in Australia, and I have noticed how enclosed the Koreans are, and also how mean they are when it comes to paying for services. They very rarely do anything outside their own communities, and very few of them learn English to the level of proficiency.</p>
<p>It should also be kept in mind that Korea has very few migrants, and no programme to process permanent settlement. The Koreans simply just don&rsquo;t like foreigners, including non-Koreans in the countries to which they migrate. This article is evidence of their own xenophobia and resentment of needing expertise from outsiders if they are to communicate with the outside world and find out about developments that can&rsquo;t be expressed within the limited Korean language.</p>
<p>As for promiscuity, I read an article the other day which asserted there were about 1 million Korean women working as prostitutes, or about 1 in 5 of all Korean women of working age. This number could not be merely to satisfy the demands of frisky English teachers. </p>

		<p>Korea is a &#8220;multicultural&#8221; country, says this person Ouwehand? Maybe he should refrain from poking his nose into the  politics of other countries and stick to teaching English, which is what he&rsquo;s there for. I don&rsquo;t want to generalize too broadly but some Americans who go overseas for one reason or another are not the best ambassadors. I&rsquo;ve known a couple people who worked overseas as teachers and they were real crackpots, making me wonder what the locals might have thought. </p>

		<p>These false and negative portrayals are manufactured so Koreans feel good about themselves and can abuse foreigners without any remorse.  East Asians have a haughty disposition.  &#8220;They esteem themselves lords&#8221; wrote William of Rubruck on his travels to East Asia in 1253.  &#8220;They are alcoholics, druggies, loose and diseased&#8221; is their excuse for luring foreigners to Korea to teach English only to not pay them, put them in sub-standard living conditions and subject them to psychological abuse.  English teachers have next to zero legal recourse because they foreign and non-East Asian and the English teaching companies in Korea pretend to close down so they don&rsquo;t face any legal actions then reappear a few months later.  These abusive conditions are the NORM in all of East Asia regardless of the job.</p>

<p>NO! Korea is NOT a multicultural country. Is perhaps the most homogeneous nation on the planet. And kept that way intentionally so. ONLY a Korean person can be a Korean. NOT only is that way, but the Korean people LIKE it that way and intend to keep it that way. Korea is prosperous and deservedly so.</p>
<p>ONLY recently, there are now in such port cities as Pusan ethnic enclaves of Russian nationals seeking a better life. Tightly controlled. Who would have thought it? When I was last in Korea, over forty years ago now, there WERE NO Russians in Korea. If you did meet a Russian, they would have been a SPY! </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that Korea and other nearby countries don&rsquo;t always attract employees of the highest caliber to do jobs such as teaching English. Even expats in higher-paid professions can be total sleazeballs once they get to the playground that is Asia. </p>
<p>However, the Koreans themselves are highly, almost hyper nationalistic, as is well known, and these sorts of things are generally a sign of that more than anything. They see 5 drunk foreigners stumbling around making a racket, hitting on local women, and are incensed by it. They don&rsquo;t &#8216;see&rsquo; the Koreans all around them doing the exact same thing. Throwing up on the subway, passed out on the curb or on benches, stumbling around etc. Spend a night out in parts of Seoul and you&rsquo;ll see it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing as the Chinese for instance having a stereotype of westerners being incredibly promiscuous, when sex shops that are officially illegal are &#8216;officially but unofficially&rsquo; on every other street corner (usually under the guise of barber shops, though everyone knows their other purpose) and extramarital affairs and mistresses are commonplace.</p>
<p>In both cases it is based far more on ignorance and insecurity than anything else. It&rsquo;s their right to discriminate with their work visas and such how they please, but these exaggerated arguments or theirs seen through a tunnel-vision view of the world don&rsquo;t always wash.</p>

		<p><i>I work as an English teacher in Australia,</i></p>
<p>Why would you want to go to a native English-speaking country to work as an English teacher there?  That is like, someone from USA going to England to teach English there.  Maybe I am misunderstanding something here.  </p>
<p><i>there were about 1 million Korean women working as prostitutes, or about 1 in 5 of all Korean women of working age.</i></p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, that&rsquo;s not realistic.  1 in 5 of all Korean women of working age are prostitutes?  If that&rsquo;s true, then Korea should be having an enormous problem of STD.  I doubt even the most promiscuous country on the planet would have any more than 1 in 30 of all its young women working as prostitutes.</p>
<p>me tried so hard to learn English, me still not there to this day.  me still have a small accent when me speak English.  but me won&rsquo;t ever give up I assure you.  Ability to communicate in English with great proficiency also helps with careers whether in Korea or outside Korea and consequently Koreans will always have no choice but trying to become as fluent as possible&hellip;  </p>
<p>sorry me will continue in a couple of days. me have to go have snacks.  </p>

		<p>@7 Anonymous- William of Rubrick never even made it to China, let alone Korea. He just stayed for a couple of months with Mongols, who having amassed such a large empire would have naturally &#8220;esteemed themselves lords&#8221;</p>
<p>But you are correct in saying the stereotype is manufactured to an extent. But not so the &#8220;poor English teachers&#8221; are kept in poverty as you suggest (its just the prodcut of xenophobia). They are paid, quite decently (by Korean standards). If they weren&rsquo;t then there wouldn&rsquo;t be any English teachers in Korea, the ones who were cheated would have spread the news back home. As for the abusive conditions, they&rsquo;re pretty much non-existent in English teaching. But Asians do push their employees very hard (and I mean VERY hard), but not out of any sadistic desire to be a lord over his minions. They do it to survive in an envrionment where every other boss does the same to maximise productivity.<br>
Samsung used to force its employees to attend boot camp back in the 90s in order drill discipline and respect for quality products into them. The employees there didn&rsquo;t feel abused, they just saw it as necessary to advance their career. And now Samsung&rsquo;s the largest tech company in the world, they feel quite proud to work for it. As a rule, Asian employers never miss paying their workers, although trying to take leave (even if you&rsquo;re sick) can be a nightmare.</p>
<p>@5 Greg Deane- I&rsquo;m surprised to hear that. I live in Sydney, and Koreans (the ones I&rsquo;ve met) tend to be quite nice (but quiet). The Korean shopkeepers at Lidcombe are very friendly once you get to know them.<br>
I find 1 in 5 quite a hard number to believe (especially as 1 in 5 Korean women is something closer to 15 million than 1). I&rsquo;d like to read the article if you can still find it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many amreners are aware of this, but the younger (born after 1980) generation of East Asians (yes, even in East Asia) are quite liberal. Korea is a country where the people have effectively priced themselves out of low-paying jobs (the high percentage of people with degrees being the primary cause) and these are imported from the Phillipines. The Koreans get along with them quite well. <br>
Korea (its government) is pushing multiculturalism, despite what many posters believe. The mayor of Seoul, Oh He-Soon, is a prominent liberal and has pushed a multicultural, foreigner friendly image within the city. He is supported in this by a large number of young Koreans, with those who have returned from a couple of years in a foreign school leading his support base. He&rsquo;s also launched a bid for the presidency of South Korea, on the same platform of a &#8220;globally-concious nation&#8221;. Although he&rsquo;s not likely to succeed due to the dominance of older, racially concious voters in the elections, Korea IS liberalising, and it will only be a matter of time before it has a liberal president. The signs were there from as far back as 2006:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite aware that Korea is 99.5% Korean, with most foreigners being Chinese and Japanese, but that figure is shrinking.</p>

		<p>South Koreas have spent millions on English lessons, tutoring, classes, and especially english villages.  The english villages are staffed with native-english speaking staff living a &#8220;fish bowl&#8221; life, where schools, groups, and individuals can go to learn and improve their english speaking skills.  Conversing with native speakers in an &#8220;immersion&#8221; setting.</p>
<p>This investment is based on the thought that global business and commerce is conducted in english, and the Koreans are serious about not being left behind.  Americans fought a war to keep the South communist-free.  Unfortunately they&rsquo;re a political island, water on three sides and the DMZ to the north.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there will always be bad-apples that act poorly, like college kids on spring break, away from the parental units.  But I can&rsquo;t help but think if there may be an anti-American current growing within the South.  A nationalism that wants only a &#8220;Korea for koreans!&#8221;  And I&rsquo;m paranoid enough to think the North Communists would be behind it, an effort to weaken the South&rsquo;s ties to the USA, who keep them safe from Communist oppression for 60+ years.  Or I&rsquo;m just some crazy crack-pot.</p>

		<p>As someone who has lived in Asia and met/know plenty of English teachers I can say the Koreans definitely have a point here. </p>
<p>While there are many well intentioned westerners who go to Asia to teach English for a little excitement or to experience a foreign culture, there are perhaps an equal amount who are just aimless losers than can be found on any given night drunk at a bar trolling for Asian girls.</p>
<p>As a result &#8216;English teacher&rsquo; has practically become synonymous  for &#8216;trash&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A black guy I know in China spends every cent he earns on gambling and drinking recently got a Chinese girl pregnant. You can imagine how thrilled the parents of the girl must be. </p>
<p>So who can blame the Koreans?</p>

		<p>Wow. It was only a week or so ago my wife told me of a Korean culture experience that a friend of a friend of hers had. An American couple was involved in hosting some Koreans for some type of &ldquo;Lets enjoy the wonderful superior Korean culture&rdquo; thing. The hosts found to their dismay that the Koreans were heavy smokers, heavy drinkers and were very rowdy. </p>
<p>When the hosts asked the Koreans to refrain from smoking in their home (a nonsmoking residence) they were ignored. Apparently it got so out of hand the couple put the Koreans in a hotel at their own expense. I have to admit I was amused when hearing about this. I looked at it as a good learning experience for this naïve couple.  Hope the word keeps spreading. <br>

		<p>Jeddermann is 100% correct.  The Koreans have NEVER subscribed to this multi-cultural garbage.  They have a good handle on the fact that so-called diversity is a sham and a scam that never has worked.</p>
<p>Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, that one of the most homogeneous nations in the world has also been one of the most educationally and industrially productive in the last half-century.</p>

		<p>I think the Koreans have a point.The vast majority of English language teachers are gap-year students,and opportunistic expats.They often have only the barest knowledge of the mechanics of the language they are ostensibly teaching,and see it merely as an easy means of acquiring beer/drug money.The North Koreans play it a bit safer,they send their own people out to learn English in Denmark and Sweden.  </p>

<p>They can be nice but I also find them to be at times very insular and cliquey. I say that based on having grown up with Korean friends at school, university, and having come across them abroad. Of the East Asians I have found they will generally be the first to shut out others when their Korean circle of friends is around. As individuals some of them are very nice people, though.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many of these teachers are former soldiers. All those bars, tattoo parlors and brothels right outside US military bases overseas (especially in Asia) aren&rsquo;t there by accident. Unfortunately, US servicemen have for decades put the &#8220;ugly&#8221; in the phrase &#8220;ugly American&#8221; with their drunkenness, promiscuity and other assorted misconduct. Yet another reason to dismantle the empire and bring the troops home.</p>

		<p>End to Illusion, I used William of Rubruck&rsquo;s account as an example.  It happened to be the most to the point example describing East Asian&rsquo;s haughty nature.  Yes, it is abuse where you create a hostile environment where these foreigners are unwelcome at the same time not paying them and fleecing them of every cent they have so they struggle to leave.  We, Koreans, want English speakers to teach us English but we, Koreans, will make life hell while they are in Korea.</p>
<p>&#8220;SMOE, EPIK, and GEPIK have sent out notice to schools that they should hire inexperienced teachers because of PLIABILITY and lower salaries. In case you didn&rsquo;t know it, SMOE, EPIK, and GEPIK send out [memos] all of the time dealing with foreign teachers, and almost all of these memos deal with something negative for foreign teachers. They even send small books to schools and tell them how to &#8216;deal with foreign teachers&rsquo; so that foreign teachers get the short end of the stick. You don&rsquo;t believe me? Ask your school about the &#8220;book&#8221; that they have for dealing with foreign teachers. Go ahead. You&rsquo;ll see. SMOE, EPIK, and GEPIK are not on your side.&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/3295w8v" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3295w8v</a><br>
&#8220;Recruiters, aren&rsquo;t hiring older, experienced teachers because schools don&rsquo;t want to pay them.&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/23loflb" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/23loflb</a><br>
&#8220;They&rsquo;re the ones who HIRE the &#8216;unqualified&rsquo; NETs (Native English Teachers). They give us no training, no curriculum and no support and then say &#8216;Damn these NETs.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>
Koreans like to hire young, inexperienced foreigners so they can exploit them.  These young adults are naive and ignorant of Koreans, their nature and culture.  It is common for foreign teachers to not get paid after 3-6 months.  Their contract usually are a year long.  That&rsquo;s why you have situations like the one Tim McHugh descibed.  The Korean government recently started taxing housing stipends, flight reimbursements, settlement allowances, and overtime pay for English teaching visa holders for stuff they already paid for.  This is on top of extensive teaching evaluations, drug testing, death threats and organizations like the Anti-English Spectrum group that harass, stalk and post data about English teachers on the internet all in an effort to make life hell in Korea.</p>
<p>This &#8220;charity&#8221; work is nothing more than a scheme by Koreans to exploit young and naive foreigners into doing free labor.  Koreans know that no matter how much work these foreign teachers do they will never be well received in Korea because Koreans loathe non-East Asians and the Korean media will churn out defamatory pieces on a regular basis to override any possible goodwill the &#8220;charity&#8221; work does.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s concerning about all these comments dismissing the foreign teachers is that it shows once again white people don&rsquo;t learn.  White people think that non-white people are just like them which has been the main argument for opening immigration.  No, they are not.  The assumption among these posters is that Koreans are as open, nice, fair and liberal as white people when that is not the case.  Presenting a &#8220;good face&#8221; is apart of East Asian culture.  That&rsquo;s why articles like this one get blanketed by East Asians trying to present a &#8220;good face&#8221; while libeling non-East Asians.  The REALITY is English teachers are good, upstanding, honest people in an abusive, corrupt Korean system.  So don&rsquo;t believe the spinners who write that Korea is becoming multicultural because they allowed a couple Fillipinos in or that Korea is becoming liberal, they know what you want to hear.  Korea will be the same culturally well into the future.</p>

I&rsquo;ve known a couple of North Americans who&rsquo;ve taken English-teaching jobs in Korea in recent years, plus a couple more who did it in Japan in the &rsquo;80s. Plus, these people have told me numerous stories about their other Westerner colleagues and friends they worked with over there. </p>
<p>The profession does not, in my experience, attract the best sort of white person. The one&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve known have all been, to one extent or another educated slackers or other similar artsy weirdos. Or they&rsquo;re lazy, low-level quick-buck chancers who, having burned all their bridges here, and need to go someplace where people don&rsquo;t know them. Or crackheads trying to quit so they&rsquo;re looking for a place where they won&rsquo;t be able to find any crack. Or lusting after &#8220;cherry blossoms&#8221;&hellip; including, I have heard, taking advantage of their teaching position to indulge their unhealthy erotic interest in the <i>underage</i> females who are their students. Not exactly molestation, but definitely heading in a pedophilic direction. </p>
<p>One of them caused so much trouble in Tokyo   &mdash;   due to his abuse of various illegal substances   &mdash;   that the govt of Japan actually EXPELLED him; and blacklisted him from re-entry. </p>
<p>Consequently, I don&rsquo;t doubt that the Koreans have some legitimate complaints about their presence. I support every nation&rsquo;s right to toss out ANYBODY they don&rsquo;t like FOR WHATEVER REASON. In fact, no reason NEED be given at all. If a country   &mdash;   ANY country   &mdash;   has been kind enough to allow in someone from elsewhere, that country has the right to TERMINATE the agreement at any time. No questions asked. No appeals. No recourse of any kind. </p>
<p>Korea should have the unquestioned right   &mdash;   as should America and EVERY OTHER Western country   &mdash;   to say, &#8220;Sorry, but you&rsquo;re just not working out. So you have to leave. Now. Pack your bags immediately, because a driver is waiting to take you to the airport.&#8221; </p>

<p>White men go to South Korea &#8220;to teach english&#8221;, because, in that country, a white man can have sex with a different teenage girl every night, if that is what he wishes. I&rsquo;m not talking about prostitutes (although some white men start pimping the girls out&hellip;..something they should and sometimes are, harshly punished for by authorities).</p>
<p>That is what the entire ex-pat community is about.</p>
<p>This is a continuation of an age old phenomenon of gene theft.  White genes are superior.  Every culture except whites, not only know this, but often celebrate it.  When whites come into contact with these communities, everything possible is done to cause many births from unions with white men.  Whole ruling classes of non-white countries are deeply rooted in this concept.</p>
<p>Ahem&hellip;.don&rsquo;t believe me.  Buy a plane ticket to go on vacation.  Spend time away from the usual tourist areas.</p>
<p>You will be harassed by women.</p>

		<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t the Koreans be anti-English speaking? It&rsquo;s their country. I applaud all efforts against &#8220;diversity&#8221; training, even when they take place in an Asian country. Westerners are becoming a degenerate population, at least when compared to Asians. Drugs, gay rights, tolerance and apologetics for crime. I&rsquo;m disgusted, why shouldn&rsquo;t the Koreans be. And mandatory testing for HIV/AIDS is the ONLY way the disease will be defeated. </p>
<p>FACT: Korea, as of a few years ago, sends more Christian missionaries to the USA than the USA sends to Korea. That&rsquo;s a FACT.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When English teachers go out into the community and volunteer, collect clothes for poor kids and volunteer English lessons at the orphanage nearby, than instead of being that kind of faceless, scary, English teacher, it humanizes us and by contributing to Korean society and saying we&rsquo;re not here just to drink and party and take our money and go home. We&rsquo;re part of Korean society, and we want to be responsible members and contributors to Korean society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What no one seems to want to point out, is this. If you are White, you will NEVER be part of ANY society, other than a White one. Genetically, you stick out like the proverbial &#8216;sore thumb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Secondly, why should we call Koreans or Japanese xenophobic, as if it were a BAD thing? What we should be doing is creating, fostering, TEACHING xenophobia in America, to stop/stem the tide of non-Whites, non-Europeans who WANT to assimilate, into this nation, before it is too late!</p>
<p>I taught ESL (as it was called) for ten years. I thought (as a naive 20-something) &#8220;How nice, they want to learn to be Americans.&#8221; What I found, after seeing some of the graduates after they left our language school, was that they were looking ONLY for their nation&rsquo;s/family&rsquo;s SELF-interest, and how to make MONEY off the American.</p>
<p>I no longer teach ESL. Let the foreigners learn their own darned languages, and LEAVE US ALONE. As I have noted on this forum, and others, things are so clearly defined to me now, that even OUR kids, in learning another language, should not learn the language of the &#8216;oppressor.&rsquo; To that end, I always say, &#8220;In the USA, Learning Spanish should be considered an act of treason.&#8221; Let the Taco Bell employees learn English&hellip; but better yet. ship them all back, and let Americans do the jobs, we &#8216;supposedly&rsquo; won&rsquo;t do. In today&rsquo;s economy, I bet a lot of Anglos would be GLAD for a f/t job with benefits, and a healthy &#8216;all white&rsquo; work environment.</p>

		<p>Poster #25 - I am in agreement with you and believe me, I would be the first to say these people have no business being in Australia. I was merely making a general observation based on the statement I had quoted in my previous post. I think the part that I consider important in my observation is that Koreans maintain their cliquey nature even when overseas. They will tolerate and talk to others, but they have a very strong sense of who they belong with. Which is all the more reason we don&rsquo;t need them mass-migrating over.</p>

		<p> Korea is a sovereign country with every right to limit immigration, as well as temporary residents to their country. Korea should preserve its ancient racial stock, customs and folkways. White/European countries should be extended the same rights and not be accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; every time they attempt a rational immigration policy. Unfortunately, the controlled media depicts any attempt to limit Third World immigration by whites as &ldquo;Nativism&rdquo;.  Why don&rsquo;t they use the same word for restrictive Asian countries?</p>

<p>That is exactly the experience white men have in many non-white countries.  There is actually an underground community of whites who spend extended periods of time in various non-white countries for exactly that purpose.</p>
<p>This has been going on for hundreds of years lol.  It&rsquo;s why you see whole communities of non-whites in some places with white racial features.  They are descended from ancient white sex tourists.</p>

		<p>To #26 &#8220;Almost Music Phd&#8221; I think your comments sum it up perfectly.</p>
<p>The large Korean community here in Sydney seem to be exactly that, here to get what they can get out of our society. While they may be polite if running a business, that is all, they otherwise keep to themselves and get very angry if you get on the wrong side of them.</p>
<p>As for showing respect for their culture in their own country whether as teachers or tourists, I agree. It is a pity that the influx of foriegners to the West are not prepared show the same respect for our ways and traditions.</p>
<p>As for teaching English, it still is the language of trade and commerce, but for how long? I get the feeling we will soon be a minority in this world, and with the USA embracing Spanish the outlook is not good. We even have Spanish inflicted on our kids by the medium of &#8220;Sesame Street&#8221;</p>
<p>A final comment on Korean Culture, they eat dog meat, can we really have much in common with them. It is enough to turn me off from ever driving a Hyundai or using Samsung appliances!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Korean living in Korea. Like all other Korean parents, I want  my kids to speak/read English fluently because, as I see, if they can speak English, they can access more easily to the vast ocean of human knowledge. As for this point, all you have to do is to compare Wikipedia pages written in English and in other languages. </p>
<p>So I had to send my kids to one of these English cram schools. The biggest worry was if teachers in the cram school were &#8220;normal&#8221;. By &#8220;normal&#8221;, I mean someone who don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be smart but are sane enough not to do drugs or not to do bad things. You may accuse me being a xenophobia but I&rsquo;m not and I&rsquo;m educated enough try to judge things based on facts. I saw plenty of bad English teachers (in the cram schools). Of course, this does not mean that I support any absurd discriminatory laws against all foreigners. I also know many good people. </p>
<p>Anyway, I was very fortunate to have a good teacher for my kids. She is from a rural Canadian family. (Incidentally, Canadian female teachers are favorite among Korean parents). I can&rsquo;t say she is bright, but she is warm-hearted and genuinely likes to play with kids. I&rsquo;m very happy with her and I&rsquo;m willing to write a petition to my government if any law is bothering English teachers like her (but not for druggies and perverts). </p>

		<p>Yes, the Koreans have the right to not let anyone come into their country for any reason and to have any immigration rules they want. However,Koreans like others will be one of the ones that yell &#8220;racism&#8221; when coming or wanting to come to a &#8220;White country&#8221;. While some Whites do act bad in Asia, there are plenty of them that act up here in the USA too.</p>

		<p>Regarding SamSung, trust me, while SamSung indeed is the most successful electronics company in Korea (there is a distnict difference between an IT company and an electronics company and SamSung is not an IT company.) not everything SamSung puts their hands on turns into pure gold.  SamSung experienced their share of failures in the past.  </p>
<p>I am a big fan of Google and Adobe, but not everything those two powerful companies put their hands on turns into pure gold either.  </p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing search engine, the knockoff attempt from Microsoft to challenge Google, has just reported a net loss of 560 million dollars this quarter only&hellip;  that means, over a year, the Bing search engine most likely ends up with a couple of billion dollars in loss for Microsoft.. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/33xeq8f" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/33xeq8f</a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make too much of a fuss about this issue, as its relatively minor, even to Koreans. For the record, I disagree with the &#8220;huaghty&#8221; nature of the East Asian individual (haughtiness lies in East Asian governments), but I suppose everyone&rsquo;s perceptions are different. I&rsquo;ll focus on the issue in the article now, as its more relevant.</p>
<p>The majority of English teachers in Korea are not mistreated.The sources you give are a blog, which is not exactly reliable. The writer has some supporters, so I won&rsquo;t be so foolish as to dismiss your point outright, but I do have some things to add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recruiters, aren&rsquo;t hiring older, experienced teachers because schools don&rsquo;t want to pay them.&rdquo;<br>
That&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening and I won&rsquo;t even attempt to deny it. Even in Korea schools must run on a budget, and despite the attempt by the Government there to increase English education, its still a very secondary consideration in the minds of most principals at schools. Those hired are informed of their pay and are paid on time in the vast majority of cases (and I mean maybe one out of a thousand might be cheated, if even that). The vast majority of English teachers are young expats who want to experience another country without having to have money beforehand. English teaching is the ideal (temporary) solution. Once they&rsquo;ve spent enough time in South Korea, they head home. I doubt there are many English teachers in Korea that are older than 40. I don&rsquo;t know about Korea, but in Japan, they&rsquo;re looked down upon as they&rsquo;re seen to have no worthwhile activity to head home for, and are often shunned (even by other expats).<br>
So these teachers aren&rsquo;t &#8220;exploited&#8221; in the conventional sense, they&rsquo;re just employed as they&rsquo;re willing (not forced) to be paid less. Also, the blog that you cited is overwhelmingly pro-Korean in tone, and it&rsquo;s quite obvious the (white) writer has enjoyed his time in South Korea (he even states he maintains a &#8220;connection&#8221; with the people), so it can&rsquo;t be that bad to teach English there can it?</p>
<p>Moving back to the point&hellip;<br>
Both Koreans and English teachers there must accept a portion of the blame. There have been crimes by English teachers in Korea, and there was a particularly notorious incident last year where a rape occurred with the teacher in question shared the files over the internet. On the korean side, you have a fanatic &#8220;Anti-English Spectrum&#8221; AES (ironically abbreviated in English) that has now started harassing English teachers after a gang of teachers disturbed passengers on a Seoul subway and posted the video on the expat site &#8220;English Spectrum&#8221;. So neither side is blameless.<br>
But the Korean media is the most guilty party. Newspapers in Korea are heavily sensationalist and blow small incidents out of proportion, and agitate both sides of any issue (just look at the Korean media&rsquo;s cries about the &#8220;epidemic of bullying&#8221; that&rsquo;s sweeping tha nation, apparently inspired by Korean movies)</p>
<p>Better understanding is required from both sides. Finally where did everyone here get the idea that english teachers HAD to be white? Wasn&rsquo;t there an article on amren a couple of months back about a black English teacher in Korea?</p>
<p>@22 Anonymous<br>
I doubt it, unless you go to Itaewon. Women there will do anything to get foreign citizenship.<br>
One of my friends who went to Japan and no girl would approach him. He was Spanish, so maybe they didn&rsquo;t think he was their version of white? Who knows?<br>
If you haven&rsquo;t been to an Asian country, then I don&rsquo;t think its wise to comment on their sexual habits. Korea (along with Taiwan and China) are very conservative nations that are gradually liberalising. Despite this a third of young South Koreans only have sex after marriage, and you have to go through quite a number of dates to even kiss, let alone anything serious. Korean women are more than happy to date outside their race, but I don&rsquo;t see any real preference for white men. These are just my observations.<br>
In Taiwan though, women will almost NEVER go out with a white (or non-Taiwanese) man, it&rsquo;s still a virulently racist country. They won&rsquo;t even consider the Chinese, who are exactly the same as they are.</p>
