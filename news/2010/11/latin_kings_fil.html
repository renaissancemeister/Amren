<h1>Latin Kings File Federal Civil Rights Complaint Against Greensboro Police</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News &amp; Record (Greensboro, North Carolina), November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The local faction of the Almighty Latin Kings and Queens street gang has filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the Greensboro Police Department, that alleges officers have violated their civil rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The gang is accusing the police department of violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights act of 1964, alleging unlawful racial discrimination.</p>
<p>The gang alleges the police department has continually harassed members since 2005 because of their race, color or national origin by filing numerous baseless charges against them, subjecting them to discriminatory traffic stops, non-consensual searches and false arrests that use excessive force, according to a news release.</p>
<p>They also allege officers have continually visited their workplaces and residences, causing them to lose their jobs and homes.</p>

		<p>wow, i&rsquo;d much rather see these gangs conduct business by lawsuit than gunshot. Are they an official social club now? Wont the police just use this information (their membership rolls) to better track them? </p>
<p>More police brutality&hellip;</p>
<p>The police did do this type of thing across the country starting in the 1980&rsquo;s. Area&rsquo;s were named &#8216;known drug areas&rsquo; and constitutional rights inside them were curtailed to varying degrees. Are these named &#8216;known gang areas&rsquo; or something? It doesn&rsquo;t help to have these kind of programs as a deterrent if the citizens living in them are not fully informed about these changes. They can notify everyone about sex offenders but not this? Don&rsquo;t we pay enough taxes already? </p>

		<p>The lawyers for the LKs better be careful, or they could be creating a paper trail enough for the Feds to come right back and prove RICO.</p>

		<p>Ah, gee whiz!  My heart really bleeds for hispanic thugs feeling like they&rsquo;ve been discriminated against.  They&rsquo;re such innocent little darlings that would never hurt a fly!  </p>

		<p>  This complaint is only the latest public display of arrogance<br>
 by a blatantly illegal group of thugs, who have as supporters local civil rights churches, black members of the Greensboro Police Department and of course the local &#8220;media&#8221;. Even as they roam our streets terrorizing poor citizens and jacking up buisnesses to &#8216;support&rsquo; them, they are lauded by the local civil rights mouthpieces as &#8220;community organizers&#8221;. In the eyes of the local media they can do no wrong. Meanwhile, last weekend was a particularly bloody one on our city streets- Two downtown shootings and several muggings and an unknown number of robberies due to the fact that the media WILL NOT cover these crimes out of fear of retribution/bad publicity. <br>
  Until our State Government decides to crack down on these illegals, the future will only be worse for citizens of the &#8216;Gate City&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gang members suffer from racial discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.  But since they don&rsquo;t have jobs and they dropped out of school,  they now are known as the Latin Losers. </p>
<p>But they did win something.  Now they get a free set of bracelets, plus a free ride to the slammer everytime they&rsquo;re caught selling dope, and a good portion of them are pulled out of the slammer for an all expense vacation back to mexico.<br>

		<p>Why do mestizos and amerindians insist on calling themselves &#8220;Latin(os)&#8221;  They are not of the Latin tribe of Italy.  They have no connection to the latin language even.  </p>
<p>So they speak spanish, so what?  They didn&rsquo;t invent it.  It was imposed on them.  If I learn to speak Spanish it doesn&rsquo;t make me a &#8220;Latino.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The French speak a derivative of Latin also.  We don&rsquo;t call the French or Portuguese or Romanians &#8220;Latinos&#8221;.</p>
