<h1>Hot 97 and Kiss FM Executive Terrence Battle Says NYPD Racially Profiled Him With Frisk</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rocco Parascandola, New York Daily News, November 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A manager at popular radio stations Hot 97 and Kiss FM says cops ordered him out of a cab and frisked him right in front of his Brooklyn home just because he&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>Terrence Battle, creative services manager at the stations, said the incident on Saturday left him feeling humiliated and furious.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was outrageous,&#8221; Battle said. &#8220;But the sad part about it is it&rsquo;s an everyday occurrence. I can&rsquo;t say this is true for all police officers, but dealing with these officers, I was obviously considered a suspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When the [taxi] driver stopped to drop Battle at his home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, three plainclothes cops from the 81st Precinct got out of their unmarked car, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They said it was a routine stop, nothing personal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Battle said he told the two officers and a sergeant that he lived there and had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eventually, Battle got out of the car and let police frisk him, search his bag and jot down his personal information.</p>
<p>The NYPD said the officers stopped the livery because it had a decal that allows police to stop the car at any time to ensure the driver&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Cops said the partition was open, suggesting a robbery, and that Battle matched the description of a man  &mdash;  black, 6 feet tall and 250 pounds  &mdash;  wanted in eight robberies in Bed-Stuy and East New York.</p>
<p>But Battle, who is 280 pounds, said police mentioned only the decal program. He has one out-of-state arrest in his past; it is sealed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Battle has filed a complaint with the Internal Affairs Bureau and with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;ll use the experience to explain to his sons, 11 and 13, how to deal with police.</p>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t he be proud he was doing nothing wrong? Or does he have a guilty consciences? </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me he&rsquo;s an expert on ethics, as are all blacks, and he simply knows this is wrong?</p>
<p>Or maybe he&rsquo;s been reading too many newspaper articles where every cop is a criminal and every person of color a saint and minorities in prison are all &#8216;victims&rsquo;. .  because any other kind of article would be &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;.</p>

If he didn&rsquo;t fit the profile of a group of people who commit a great proportion of crime, he wouldn&rsquo;t be profiled.</p>
<p>He needs to be blaming his brothers for painting a target on his back.</p>

<p>I notice its out of the question for this guy to blame, let alone sue, the cab company.</p>

<p>Taxi driver used to be the number two least safe job, after airline pilot. Almost certainly do to robberys and killings of drivers. I guess this guy being &#8216;offended&rsquo; is more important that that. </p>

		<p>This must be a way to get off free if you&rsquo;re black or hispanic and you are a criminal.  Just whine and complain about your civil rights being violated</p>

		<p>Presumably, these frivolous complaints are going to either lessen or grow ever more complicated now that the NYPD is officially majority &#8220;minority.&#8221; Yes, that&rsquo;s correct, non-whites now make up the larger portion of the enormous army of police-officers known as the NYPD:</p>

		<p>St. Louis City has a similar car decal program, called H.E.A.T.   &mdash;   &#8220;Help Eliminate Auto Theft.&#8221;  If you take the sticker, then you give the SLPD the right to pull over the car if it&rsquo;s being driven between 1 AM and 5 AM in the City, to check to see if the driver either is the owner or has proper links to the owner (spouse, children, parents, other family, etc).  If not, the car is assumed stolen.</p>
<p>The main problem with the program is that car thieves, especially in St. Louis City, aren&rsquo;t that willing to pull over when the cop sirens go off.  They usually hit the gas, and since they&rsquo;re only &#8220;car thieves,&#8221; the cops aren&rsquo;t allowed to chase.</p>
<p>The NY program seems different because it&rsquo;s not just limited to the overnights, and not just for the expressed purpose of stopping auto theft.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that there is a lot of anti-white and anti-police rhetoric spewed on &#8220;Hot 97&#8221; and &#8220;Kiss FM.&#8221;  Several St. Louis black music station personalities have taken such &#8220;liberties&#8221; over the year, (&#8220;shoot that m-word f-word white cop,&#8221; &#8220;the white cops are the nazi 3K,&#8221; &#8220;white cops fire machine guns into the skulls of black babies and love doing it,&#8221; are some of the niceties that black music and talk radio personalities in this town have said over the air), and have found that, at least for awhile, that the SLPD would pull them over frequently based on the flimsiest pretext.  (Do you blame them?)</p>
