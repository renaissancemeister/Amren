<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/31/cologne-mosque-german-far-right">German Far Right Emerges From Shadows to Join Cologne Campaign Against Mosque</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Connolly, Guardian (London), October 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The buzz of drills and whine of cranes fill the air as scores of workers in yellow hard hats scuttle around the concrete shell of a building which, even in its unfinished state, dominates the working-class Cologne district of Ehrenfeld. For the thriving local Turkish community, the sprawling complex represents the chance for an entire infrastructure under one roof  &mdash;  from a mosque to a hairdresser&rsquo;s to a travel agency.</p>
<p>But for others in the city the new mosque and cultural centre has provoked fears that the multimillion-euro project will do little to encourage integration and give the Turks free rein to live in their own autonomous world. The right-wing populist Pro Cologne movement has campaigned against the mosque and moved a step closer to its goal last week after joining forces with Austria&rsquo;s far-right Freedom party (FPO).</p>
<p>&#8220;Every new movement needs a unique selling point,&#8221; said Bernd Schöppe, of Pro Cologne. &#8220;Ours is the mosque. If ever you needed a sign of the real threat of Islamisation in Germany, it&rsquo;s that mosque, with its huge dome and 55m-high minarets.&#8221; Pro Cologne, a small but growing movement which recently won seats on the city council, hopes to boost its profile by associating itself with the FPO, which made its name a decade ago after sweeping to power under the leadership of the late extreme-right firebrand Jörg Haider.</p>
<p>This month the FPO was celebrating another feat, after securing 26% of the vote in the Vienna elections. One of its slogans urged Muslims to &#8220;go home&#8221;, and among the election paraphernalia it dished out was a computer game where players score points for shooting at mosques and minarets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We share similar views,&#8221; said Judith Wolter, Pro Cologne&rsquo;s deputy leader. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a good partnership. They need us to build a rightwing faction on the European stage ahead of the 2014 EU parliamentary elections, we need them to help us win more voters. We&rsquo;d be happy to adopt their name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her party, she admitted, is working hard to polish its public image, and is fighting through the courts to be removed from the watchlist of Germany&rsquo;s Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which has the movement under surveillance for its anti-foreigner rhetoric.</p>
<p>The timing of the collaboration could hardly be better. Ever since the release this summer of a polemical book by a former finance senator and central banker arguing that Germany is being &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; by &#8220;over-breeding&#8221; foreigners, the country has been gripped by a fierce immigration debate that has seen the chancellor, Angela Merkel, enter the fray. Thilo Sarrazin&rsquo;s Deutschland Schafft Sich Ab (Germany is Digging its Own Grave) has sold more than a million copies and led to 20% of Germans saying that they would consider voting for a Sarrazin party.</p>
<p>Rightwing populists, meanwhile, have interpreted it as a direct invitation to them to form a new party. Mindful of this, Merkel has been forced into making comments that smack of desperation to claw back disillusioned voters who think she has moved her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Socialist Union (CSU), too far to the left; she recently declared that Germany&rsquo;s attempts at multiculturalism had &#8220;utterly failed&#8221;. The CSU&rsquo;s head, Horst Seehofer, also stoked the fire with his call for a halt to immigration from Turkey and Arab nations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anti-immigration utterings of Sarrazin, backed up by the comments by Merkel and Seehofer, are like a gift to the far right. They have had a door opened to them that has previously been closed, because it is now socially acceptable to say things that before nobody dared to voice,&#8221; said Alexander Häusler, a social scientist and neo-Nazism expert at Düsseldorf&rsquo;s University of Applied Sciences.</p>
<p>At present, Germany&rsquo;s far right lacks unity and cohesion. But according to Häusler they could reverse that situation with the help of the Austrians under the leadership of the charismatic FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache.</p>
<p>Häusler described the fact that the push for Germany&rsquo;s far right is coming from the small neighbouring republic of Austria as &#8220;history repeating itself as farce&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Austria&rsquo;s political culture has developed differently from that of Germany&rsquo;s,&#8221; he said, because Germany underwent a postwar denazification process that Austria was largely spared. &#8220;You have been able to say things on the Austrian political stage that would not have been acceptable in Germany,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Nurhan Solkan, general secretary of the Central Council of Muslims, said: &#8220;Personally, it scares me. The inhibitions towards voicing your opinion about Muslims are fast breaking down. Nowadays I only need to park my car slightly badly for an old lady to come up to me and shout that I&rsquo;d better go home to wherever I came from.&#8221;<br>

<p>Nope, no bias in this article. No siree!</p>
<p><i>&hellip;and among the election paraphernalia it dished out was a computer game where players score points for shooting at mosques and minarets.</i></p>
<p>Is this even true?</p>

<p><i>Wah waaah waaaaaaaaaaaaaah</i>, people are saying things I don&rsquo;t like, we&rsquo;ve got to censor them <i>WAAAAAAAAAAH!</i></p>
<p>The need for censorship: hallmark of ALL totally-not-contemptible ideas, y&rsquo;know.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Austria&rsquo;s political culture has developed differently from that of Germany&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said, because Germany underwent a postwar denazification process that Austria was largely spared.</i></p>
<p>&hellip;and here we have them setting the stage for persecution of anybody with sense, by tying Nazism, the leftist exemption from all decency and reason, into whatever they want quashed.</p>
<p>Also, this bit holds similarity to something found in the &#8220;Victory In Sweden&#8221; American Renaissance piece linked to by the &#8220;Breakthrough!&#8221; banner on the right of the site. From it:</p>
<p><i>Naturally, the SD got the most support in those parts of the country with the largest numbers of immigrants. In Scania, at the country&rsquo;s southern tip, 10 percent of voters supported the Sweden Democrats, resulting in calls that Scania be handed back to the Danes, from whom the Swedes conquered it in 1658. The Danish People&rsquo;s Party, whose influence has given Denmark one of the most sensible immigration policies in the European Union, has been a model for the SD.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s those damned Austrians corrupting our pure, tolerant nation!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s those damned Danes corrupting our pure, tolerant nation!&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it has any significance, but it struck me.</p>

		<p>I always take these &#8220;far right&#8221; stories with a grain of salt. In Germany, anything to the right of Lenin is considered &#8220;far right&#8221;. What they really mean is that people are getting fed up with the socialism.</p>

Häusler described the fact that the push for Germany&rsquo;s far right is coming from the small neighbouring republic of Austria as &ldquo;history repeating itself as farce&rdquo;.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The sad part is that it&rsquo;s not farce, certainly not from the perspective of Hitler&rsquo;s prognostications and the way the center-left has made them come true in Germany.</p>
<p>A good dose of pride in country and people would do the Germans a LOT of good right now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;Austria&rsquo;s political culture has developed differently from that of Germany&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said, because Germany underwent a postwar denazification process that Austria was largely spared. &ldquo;You have been able to say things on the Austrian political stage that would not have been acceptable in Germany,&rdquo; he added.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>What, the truth you mean?</p>
<p>The truth is ugly and if there is any justice, it&rsquo;s about to get even uglier.  People don&rsquo;t want to mate outside their race because their race is a concentration of all that has made prior generations successful, genetically.  By all historical indications, the SWA region has nothing to be proud of in recent times or they would not be trying to take over Europe.  Throw in the realities of IQ by genetics and one can only HOPE that the Germans get _really mad_.</p>
<p>At the right people.</p>
<p>They are great organizers.  They can do this, they can flagship Europe out of the clutches of EU/EADS and make Europe an ethnic safety zone again.</p>
<p>What can&rsquo;t happen is another Hitler.  Literally.  Hindenburg put him in office with less than 37% of the vote for the simple reason that he (President Hindenburg) was himself rabidly against the &#8216;social democrats&rsquo; who were Marxists in all but name.</p>
<p>Three years later, Hindenburg was gone and Hitler was Chancellor by defacto referendum (he quite honestly put out a vote-of-confidence request) and shadowy second-government takeover of functional institutions.  Acts which he spent the better part of five years setting up.</p>
<p>NONE of which could happen, today, without being noticed.</p>
<p>So ignore the Nazi label good sirs and make this -your- homeland again.  Europe will follow you as they never followed ol&rsquo; Adolph.</p>
<p>Let the madness stop.</p>

		<p>A left wing newspaper like the <i>Guardian</i> loves to throw around labels like &#8220;far right&#8221; and &#8220;extreme right&#8221;.  When have they <i>ever</i> labeled a party &#8220;far left&#8221; or &#8220;extreme left&#8221;?  The mass media is sufficiently far to the left that nothing looks &#8220;far left&#8221; to them.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Austria&rsquo;s political culture has developed differently from that of Germany&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said, because Germany underwent a postwar denazification process that Austria was largely spared. &ldquo;You have been able to say things on the Austrian political stage that would not have been acceptable in Germany,&rdquo; he added.</i></p>
<p>In other words, due to being spared denazification, there is still some semblance of free speech in Austria.  If we oppose any sort of totalitarianism, including both Communism and National Socialism, as I do, then shouldn&rsquo;t we be consistent and actually allow free thought, free speech, and a free press?  We look like bloody hypocrites when we claim to promote freedom and then work to undermine countries when their people don&rsquo;t vote for the candidates our government wants (as happened with Austria) or when we tolerate laws that make certain opinions and ideas illegal.<br>

		<p>Things are slowly starting to happen, aren&rsquo;t they ??</p>
<p>White America has been awoken by the Obama administration&rsquo;s arrogance and ignorance.</p>
<p>In Europe whites are starting to take note of the damage done to their countries by the liberal traiterous elite.</p>
<p>Australians are getting a taste of the wry fruits of multi-culturalism, and rejecting it in their own way.</p>
<p>In South Africa whites are not yet allowed to critisise any black or non-white, but the years of absolute criminality and ineptitude has caught upwith the government, and they are panicking in a big way - especially seen in the light that the white man&rsquo;s aid is rapidly drying up, and patience running out.</p>
<p>For the White world it is now time to go back to the drawing board - the drawing board being the Bible&rsquo;s TRUE meaning ( not religion, but faith ).</p>

<p>Why should they need a &#8220;gift&#8221; to make it possible to speak? Was that the only way?</p>
<p>How did we, the West,  get to this bizarre point, where patriotic expressions are condemned as &#8220;Far Right&#8221;?  Where love of country and one&rsquo;s people are viewed as contemptible expressions of hate?  Where objection to being invaded by hordes of unassimilable foreigners is held as equivalent to advocating concentration camps and gas chambers?  Where citizens hardly dare open their mouths for fear of lawsuits, prison, personal disgrace, and being labeled as racists and nazis?  Where citizenship itself has less value than alien status, and  &#8220;persecuted&#8221; refugees will be entitled to all the benefits on a golden platter?  Where Christian is bad, and non-Christian is good?  Where white is automatically inferior to color, and natives inferior to aliens?</p>
<p>How did we get to this unbelievable, appalling point where we hate our own kind and are required to love others more than ourselves? </p>

		<p><b>&#8220;How did we get to this unbelievable, appalling point where we hate our own kind and are required to love others more than ourselves?&#8221; </b></p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>How?   Well, it goes like this.  Two thirds of a century after the central event of our time and the most heinous crime in  all human history,  we  (all whites)  are still expiating the bottomless guilt from that monstrous event  (not to mention working off the additional crime of slavery).   By now, the taint of guilt has spread to all whites, who stand  condemned  before the world as  <i>&#8220;the cancer of history&#8221;.</i> Whether we shared in the initial guilt of either genocide or slavery, we all  now share the common taint as somehow complicit, or insensitive, or at least indifferent  in  the commission of those unpardonable crimes against humanity. </p>
<p>This is a new kind of &#8220;original sin&#8221;, a secular kind that afflicts whites alone. They must be made to feel and understand their guilt,  and wallow and grovel  in it, not just to pay for it.</p>
<p>The  obvious conclusion is that whites are, per se, a dangerous group and a menace to all  human kind&hellip;  especially to all &#8220;minorities&#8221; [minority being a euphemism for  non-white or non-European].    Whites,  by definition being congenital racists,  must not be allowed to congregate anywhere in any numbers or to form a majority in any place or country, even in their homelands.  Whites, even when apparently friendly and well intentioned, are intrinsically dangerous by their racist nature.   Whites must thus be minoritized and if necessary even eliminated to  pay the price for their past sins against minorities and to  make the world at last safe for non-whites. </p>
<p>We are living in a minority-loving culture where  all values have been cunningly skewed to see whites as responsible for everything that is bad or goes wrong   (because whites are the majority, hence powerful)  and minorities are never wrong  because, by Marxist definition, they are powerless. </p>
<p>Some people  here have welcomed the idea of  whites becoming a minority when we can at last relax and  enjoy the benefits of our new minority status.  But I wouldn&rsquo;t count on that!   I suspect that when we reach that  point, the rules will  suddenly change. </p>
