<h1>Colleagues Deny Rangel&rsquo;s Plea for Delay in Trial</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Margasak, Yahoo News, Nov. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shortly after veteran Rep. Charles Rangel of New York walked out of his ethics trial in protest, a House panel began closed-door deliberations Monday on 13 counts of alleged financial and fundraising misconduct that could bring formal condemnation.</p>
<p>Only recently one of the most powerful members of Congress, Rangel was reduced to pleading in vain for colleagues to give him time to raise money for a lawyer before taking up the charges. The 80-year-old congressman left when they said no, and the rare proceeding   &mdash;   only the second for this type of hearing in two decades   &mdash;   went on without him.</p>
<p>An ethics committee panel of four Democrats and four Republicans was sitting as a jury in the case late Monday. The official acting as prosecutor said the facts were so clear there was no need to call witnesses, and panel members apparently agreed.</p>
<p>If the panel members decide Rangel violated any House rules, the full committee will hold a hearing on how he should be punished. The most likely sanction would be a House vote deploring his conduct.</p>
<p>Rangel, a 20-term congressman representing New York&rsquo;s famed Harlem neighborhood, implored the ethics panel for further delay, saying that &#8220;50 years of public service is on the line.&#8221; But the panel basically decided that the 2&frac12;-year-old case had gone on long enough   &mdash;   and Congress had little time left to deal with it in the lame duck session that commenced Monday.</p>
<p>Rangel said he had run out of money after paying his previous attorneys some $2 million and needed time to set up a legal defense fund to raise an additional $1 million.</p>
<p>Until last spring, Rangel had wielded great influence as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, a gravelly voiced, outgoing figure who raised millions for fellow lawmakers&rsquo; campaigns. He relinquished that chairmanship in March after being admonished by an ethics panel for taking corporate trips to the Caribbean in violation of House rules. There was no further punishment for that, but the current charges are another matter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the ethic panel finds that Rangel broke the rules, the House ethics committee could recommend that the full House vote to condemn his conduct. </p>
<p>&#8220;My family has caught hell&#8221; in the investigation, Rangel said in asking for more time. Earlier this fall, he had pleaded for a quick decision before the November elections. He won re-election. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I truly believe I am not being treated fairly,&#8221; Rangel said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The charges allege violations of: </p>
<ul>
<li>A House gift ban and restrictions on solicitations. Rangel is accused of using congressional staff, letterhead and workspace to seek donations for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York. The requests usually went to charitable arms of businesses with issues before Congress, including Rangel&rsquo;s Ways and Means Committee. </li>
<li>A U.S. government code of ethics. Several allegations fall under this code, among them: accepting favors (the Rangel Center donations) that could be construed as influencing Rangel&rsquo;s congressional duties; acceptance of a rent-subsidized New York apartment used as a campaign office, when the lease said it was for residential use only, and failure to report taxable income. </li>
<li>The Ethics in Government Act and a companion House rule requiring &#8220;full and complete&#8221; public reports of a congressman&rsquo;s income, assets and liabilities each year. Rangel is charged with a pattern of submitting incomplete and inaccurate disclosure statements. He filed amended reports covering 1998 to 2007 only after the investigative ethics panel began looking into his disclosures. He belatedly reported at least $600,000 in assets.</li>

		<p>As an aside, Australia recently held Parliamentary elections.  I am glad Julia Gillard, who took over as Australian Labour Party leader and therefore PM after Kevin Rudd resigned in disgrace (can&rsquo;t remember why), eked it out over the Liberal (lamestream conservative party) Party and its leader, Tony Abbott.  He&rsquo;s the one who headed the effort on the part of John Howard to railroad Pauline Hanson into prison over a matter of a few misplaced pennies, more or less.  (All the while, Howard co-opts her platform).  So I&rsquo;m glad he lost   &mdash;   Unfortunately, I have not heard that he stepped down from LIB leadership, so it might be he vs Gillard again in 2013.</p>
<p>That might be a good time for Pauline Hanson to get back in.</p>

		<p>I hope it is not lost on people that now, all at once, corrupt blacks are being done in.</p>
<p>The reason it is happening is the unholy alliance among identity groups that IS the democratic party, has been shattered.  The various factions are now warring against each other.  Blacks, represented by Obama, are blamed for the massive failure of the current administration&hellip;..and are being punished.</p>
<p>This will reach a climax with the impeachment of Obama.</p>

Even if he&rsquo;s found guilty, he gets nothing more than a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>The only punishment he got is that he lost his chairmanship of Ways and Means.</p>
<p>He won re-election with 80% of the vote. He&rsquo;s not going anywhere. &#8216;He may be a scoundrel but he&rsquo;s Harlem&rsquo;s scoundrel&rsquo;.<br>

		<p> Is it possible that the &#8220;race card&#8221; has been maxed out? Decades of charges have been placed on it and; as far as I can see; not one thing has ever been paid back.<br>
 A lot of whites that will talk about race relations are beyond fed up with the current situation.We simply cannot continue with the status qou.<br>

		<p>The only punishment he got is that he lost his chairmanship of Ways and Means.</p>
<p>The Ways and Means committee is the most powerful group of people in the country.  Without his position on that board, Rangel is literally nobody.</p>
<p>What we are seeing here is nothing less than the negro hand in the white man&rsquo;s pocket being lopped off at the wrist.</p>
<p>Racism among blacks has reached such an extreme that blacks will ONLY vote for other blacks, now.  Further, nothing matters about the candidate except that he is black and a closet communist.  Rangel isn&rsquo;t really loved (or even KNOWN) among those who vote for him.  His skin is just the right color.  Black on the outside&hellip;.red on the inside.</p>
<p>And this has become THE issue within the democratic party.  Although you will never hear it openly discussed, you will see evidence of it in what they do.  Blacks will no longer cooperate with the greater agenda of the party&hellip;..so they are being marginalized.</p>
<p>Which is WHY Rangel is being confronted with this issue at all&hellip;.after getting away with it with such raw impunity for so many years.</p>
<p>Something drastic has changed in the democratic party.  And that something was the election of Obama.  Blacks now have a widely held opinion that they rule America since Obama&rsquo;s election.  That compromise with others politically is no longer necessary.  They are no longer controllable and can&rsquo;t be harnessed for votes anymore.  They can&rsquo;t even be bought off anymore.  Literally, random crackheads are overwhelmingly supported over those who wish to buy their votes with socialist policies&hellip;.black voters neither knowing or caring about any other issue than skin color.  The phenomenon would be humorous if it weren&rsquo;t so grim.</p>
<p>After decades of promoting the racism of blacks, the democratic party has pushed it past a point of no return&hellip;.way, way, waaaaaay out of line with the reality of their actual power and no understanding of this whatsoever.  And no desire to understand it either.  All they care about is that there is a black man in the oval office.  And to their way of thinking that means they rule now and there is no longer any need or use for others.  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on who you are) they don&rsquo;t have anything even close to the power to back that up.</p>
<p>So they are being marginalized to minimize the damage and let&rsquo;s be honest here, to punish them for their hubris.  The easiest evidence of this to see is with regard to money.  Suddenly, there is no money for blacks, black causes, black candidates or fancy lawyers to defend blacks like Rangel.  </p>
<p>And no tolerance either.  The House panel basically laughed in his face at his lame excuses and (probably true) protestations of poverty.  Rangel&rsquo;s last move will be to call the panel &#8220;racist&#8221;.  When this is flat out ignored, even ridiculed, the issue will become much more clear&hellip;..at least to Rangel, I think.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s exactly like his predecessor, Adam Clayton Powell, still considered a saint in Harlem. And Marion Barry, etc.<br>
Blacks don&rsquo;t get upset;  they admire a big thief. The bigger the better.  That&rsquo;s called sockin&rsquo; it to whitey.</p>

		<p>Just another crooked black public servant. Career politicians like him make me puke&hellip;they have no idea what working for a living is like. They think taxes are for the &#8220;little guy.&#8221; I hope he gets the book thrown at him.</p>

		<p>When a New York City policeman was murdered inside a Harlem Mosque, Charlie (I think that his first name is really Carlos) Rangel worked with Mayor John Lindsay to sabotage the investigation and prevent the indictment of the murderer.</p>

		<p>The man is 80, he probably doesn&rsquo;t belong in such a high seat, just by his age.  He certainly has no business being down in the Caribbean on a fun&rsquo;n&rsquo;sun junket.</p>
<p>His sole functional use for a Democratic &#8216;stand together or swing apart&rsquo; agenda stops at censuring because no other member of the House will profer charges against him nor, apparently, will The President.</p>
<p>What about a Special Prosecutor or Grand Jury, relative to IRS tax fraud charges?  Even a petition by public citizens?</p>
<p>To me it&rsquo;s bound to come off snide, racist and ultimately as  pointless posturing because if it was serious, one of the above avenues of impeachment would be investigated.</p>
<p>So if the man has an 80% vote in his home district, why are we doing this again?  Does Ways &amp; Means offer something special to Harlem that his losing it could convince them to go to a different person?</p>
<p>Or is this just the aftermath of putting a different person in his seat to begin with?</p>
<p>I always hate drama that has no point of conception.</p>
