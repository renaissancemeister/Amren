<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Businesses have a free, simple way to check that their new hires are legal. Although far from perfect, it could reduce the lure of employment that draws illegal immigrants, experts say.</p>
<p>But most employers who depend on illegal workers  &mdash;  including the vast majority of agriculture businesses in the Central Valley  &mdash;  won&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>And Congress, under pressure from business leaders, refuses to make them  &mdash;  despite a clear voter mandate to stop illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Called E-Verify, the online government program uses records from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security to instantly check an employee&rsquo;s legal status after being hired. When word gets around that an employer uses the program, illegal immigrants stop applying, experts say.</p>
<p>A law requiring all businesses to use E-Verify would make it much more difficult for illegal immigrants to find work, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration enforcement. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The program has run into strong opposition from business groups that say it creates an administrative burden. But experts say the real reason is that E-Verify makes it harder to hire illegal workers.</p>
<p>Manuel Cunha, president of the Fresno-based Nisei Farmers League, an association of agriculture businesses in the Western U.S., acknowledged as much.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may work for Costco, but Costco doesn&rsquo;t have the problem I have&#8221;  &mdash;  a shortage of legal residents willing to work in agriculture, he said.</p>
<p>The debate over E-Verify has put local conservative groups in a tricky position: They oppose illegal immigration, but they support businesses that rely on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Farmers, meanwhile, say they&rsquo;d rather have a legal workforce but need to hire illegal immigrants. Without them, crops would rot and their competitors  &mdash;  who all hire illegal workers  &mdash;  would have an unfair advantage. In the end, they say, it&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s job to make sure their workforce is legal. <br>

		<p>A high rate of immigration means more job applicants and more customers.  By the law of supply and demand this means lower wages, higher prices, and consequently, higher profits.  <br>
 <br>
If you are in the employer - investor class you benefit from the present high rate of immigration.  If you work for a living, your standard of living is lower than it would be if immigration was restricted.  </p>

		<p>Now because of the Supreme Court ruling in favor of Citizens United these businesses, foreign and domestic, can donate huge amounts of money into political campaigns anonymously.  You know they will support every candidate whether Republican, Democrat or Independent who is for immigration deregulations (open borders would be the best) and deregulation of all aspects of their business.  White people expect too much for these business owners.  A safe working environment and a fair wage will &#8220;hurt&#8221; their profit margins.  White people don&rsquo;t learn from past mistakes.  Bringing Africans to the Americas for cheap labor was the biggest mistake in the modern era.  It laid the foundation for bringing in any non-white person for cheap labor into white societies everywhere.  It won&rsquo;t stop until white people can&rsquo;t create their own businesses and by that time non-white people will move their non-white brethren in by themselves.  The populations of every white created country will look like Bangladesh.  The place where I worked replaced the entire white cleaning staff with Central Americans in one day.  Literally, one night I left work seeing the white cleaning staff doing their work and the next the staff was entirely Central American who couldn&rsquo;t speak any English.  I live in a place that is 96% white.  It&rsquo;s a quite place but I can tell you that I now hear fire trucks and police sirens every week.  Five years ago and prior I would go two or three months before hearing a fire truck or police siren.  I think it has to do with illegal immigrants moving into the area.  An area near where I live was designated by the Bush Administration as one of the top five places in America with increasing violence about five years ago.  The area once was a tranquil place with a lot of farm land and new shopping malls.  Within 10 years it transformed into a slum.  Most of the stores in one shopping mall left and were replaced by small Mexican and Chinese/Korean businesses who placed sheets of clothe over their entrances to mark their businesses.  Part of the shopping mall was dark.  Litter and boarded up stores and houses are now a common sight.  White business owners with their desires for cheap labor have put white societies everywhere on a course for total destruction.</p>

<p>This is hypocrisy.  They say it&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s job to make sure their workforce is legal but will oppose the most effective way to enforce it   &mdash;   crippling fines on any business that hires illegals.  Competitors would have no advantage, because those laws would apply to them too.<br>

<p>Business greed, federal court-mandated social engineeering   &mdash;  - Plyler v. Doe (1982) requiring states to pay for the schooling of children brought illegally to the U. S., the nullification of Proposition 187 (which would have curbed services to illegal aliens in California) by a single Jimmy Carter-appointed federal judge (1994), the 14th Amendment corruption resulting in &#8220;birthright citizenship&#8221; for children of illegal aliens   &mdash;  - AND Congressional incompetence and vice (the 1986 amnesty of 3 million illegal aliens, the 1965 immigration act that made extended &#8220;family reunification&#8221; the driver for legal immigration) have combined to turned California from the economic powerhouse in the 60s (the place everyone wanted to be)   &mdash;  - when it was 92 percent white   &mdash;  - into the economic basket case in the 2010s when white public school enrollment is at 27 percent and climbing and Latino public school enrollment is at 50.4 percent and climbing.   </p>

		<p>What I&rsquo;d like to see:<br>
A proclamation going out to the residents of California. &#8220;If you are here illegally, GET OUT, AND GET OUT NOW. We are coming for you with the military. You, your spouse (includes live-ins, boy/girlfriends, co-parents of your anchor babies) and your 14th Amendment children will be deported immediately with the clothes on your backs, nothing more or less. If you are a legal citizen of the United States, a legal resident or a visitor with a legitimate reason for being here, a legal passport and a return ticket, you will not be molested. YES, we will be using RACIAL PROFILING to find you  &mdash;  get used to the idea. Have your papers ready to show the officer at the door. **Driver&rsquo;s license, State-issued ID, Green card, Passport/Visa, SS Card, etc.** Obvious forgeries will be spotted immediately and their users deported with the rest. More skillful facsimilies can be spotted later.<br>
Sure, we expect there will be a few mistakes, but there is always a fraction of a percentage of collateral damage and we are not overly concerned about it.<br>
We are taking OUR country back from millions of illegal invaders. You can return to your country of origin (or elsewhere as long as you leave here) but you cannot hide and you cannot stay.&#8221; </p>
<p>This sounds cold and hard, but I really think forceful expulsion at the end of a gun is the ONLY way to get rid of them at this point. This is a matter of life and death for free-born Americans and they have brought it upon themselves, admittedly with our compliance, but our compliance has worn out. </p>

		<p>The only way to stop the invasion is to go after the corporation owners and managers that hire illegal aliens. Take away the bait and the illegals will stop coming.<br>
Use draconian measures. Impose heavy fines. A flat rate for hiring any alien, plus an additional fine for each and every one found to be working for the company. Immediate forfeiture of the asset, business, factory, or establishment, to be disposed of at public auction. Mandatory prison time, again a flat rate for the offence, plus additional time for each illegal in employ. No bail, no parole and no time off for good behavior. This will be served in a regular state prison or something like Sheriff Joe&rsquo;s tent prison, no &#8220;Country Club&#8221; prison. A few, well-publicised reports of enforcement of this sort will start use of the E-verify, quick, fast, and in a hurry! Couple this with the deportation of the &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; found as well and the problem of illegal immigration will grind to a near-halt in short order. </p>

<p>I would like to see that extended to &#8221; legal immigrants&#8221; from 3rd world countries since 1965. That law was passed without our consent and was meant to drastically change the demographics of America and thereby UN-constitutional to say the least. It was a deliberate act of genocide and displacement of White Americans.  </p>

		<p>The only real conservative in America is the one who wants to preserve Western culture and values as handed down from the Roman and Greek cultures, preserved by the Church, developed by the Renaissance and polished by the entrepreneurs of the 19th and 20 th centuries prior to the LBJ/MLK Third World Revolution of the 1960&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>There is one conservative position on immigration: starve the illegals out and slash the number of legals from overseas to only Europeans who have needed skills.  Indians and Chinese doctors and businessmen: we know how much you want to help the poor of your own nations. Do it.  </p>

<p>The Constitution was written BY White men FOR White men/women, period!

<p>But of course no one will ever dare mention this fact and especially the neocon &#8220;Republicans&#8221;,(they follow the left on this issue) traitors on TV and radio and in print. That is why I will never vote for either party. Christian radio is just as bad.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me how people still buy newspapers when we have to do so much of their authors&rsquo; work for them.  E.g., unpack the above quote, which really means, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have to pay legal citizens a fair wage, because I can pay illegal aliens slave wages.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>I imagine most of the angry posts here are made by folks who don&rsquo;t own their own business, and have only their own labor to trade for their necessities.</i></p>
<p>Your imagination isn&rsquo;t much of a basis for argument.  Even if it was, your argument would still constitute an ad hominem attack.</p>
<p><i>It is the the poor uneducated whites who haven&rsquo;t figured out how to benefit from the U.S. system and feel threatened by cheap labor.</i></p>
<p>Another ad hominem attack, likewise not even based in reality.  People who don&rsquo;t want privatized profits and socialized costs (not exactly the parlance of the uneducated or poor, is it?) are against cheap illegal scabs, too. But again, even if your ad hom <i>was</i> valid, so what?  Poor uneducated BLACKS, for example (since they&rsquo;re more likely to compete with illegals, they&rsquo;re a far more germane example, but not PC, which is why you passed them over), don&rsquo;t have rights?  Their concerns and interests aren&rsquo;t valid?</p>
<p><br>
<i>Those of us who own our own, see immigrants as a cheap labor source and a solid customer base.</i></p>
<p>Oh, please.  You haven&rsquo;t a clue what any of us does for a living, so your third draw at the ad hom well falls flat, too.</p>
<p><i>Wake up</i></p>
<p>To what?  The fact that you couldn&rsquo;t argue your way out of a paper bag?</p>
<p><i>and stop whining.</i></p>
<p>I LOVE this one.  As if whining about whining isn&rsquo;t, itself, whining.</p>
<p><i>If you think that by being white you are entitled to economic protection your dead wrong.</i></p>
<p>As I said, blacks are most vulnerable to the depredations of illegal alien scab labor.  Put that in your Politically Correct pipe and smoke it.  There are limits to your economic freedom.  We don&rsquo;t allow pimping, prostitution, fraud, slavery, drug-dealing, organ trafficking, child labor, etc.  Why should we allow scab foreign labor?</p>

		<p>Strict enforcement of immigration laws is the key to maintaining a legal workforce. As matters stand, under lax enforcement, any business that pays the higher wages necessary to procure legal labor will quickly go defunct at the hands of less-scrupulous competitors. By contrast, strict enforcement will allow businesses to pass along increased labor costs to customers. Will this cause consumer price inflation? Probably just a negligible amount, as labor costs of crop harvesting are a tiny fraction of retail food prices.</p>
