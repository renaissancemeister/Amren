<h1>NAACP Voluntarily Dismisses Bias Suit Against US Airways</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Loyd, Philadeophia Inquirer, November 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What began as a startling NAACP suit accusing US Airways Group Inc. of discriminating against its African American employees at Philadelphia International Airport has ended with a settlement and a pledge by the airport&rsquo;s largest carrier to strengthen workplace diversity.</p>
<p>On the matter of the monetary terms and whether the three former US Airways employees named as plaintiffs in January&rsquo;s federal class-action suit would get  &mdash;  or even want  &mdash;  their old jobs back, no one would say.</p>
<p>The case before U.S. District Judge Petrese Tucker was voluntarily dismissed Friday, the same day the NAACP and US Airways issued a joint statement that the airline would continue a &#8220;strong commitment&#8221; to diversity and equal opportunity and would work with the NAACP to enhance its workplace-diversity programs at the Philadelphia airport and at Reagan National Airport in Washington.</p>
<p>In the statement, the NAACP and US Airways pledged to collaborate at the two airports on equal-opportunity programs, training, personnel, policies, and procedures, and to &#8220;maintain a direct dialogue&#8221; in the future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>US Airways&rsquo; human-resources staff in Tempe, Ariz., and the Philadelphia NAACP will work &#8220;closely&#8221; together, Lehmacher said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NAACP is very pleased that US Airways has agreed to work with us,&#8221; Philadelphia NAACP president J. Whyatt Mondesire said Monday. {snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP settled the case on behalf of &#8220;60-odd people that we represented, most of them here, but a couple in D.C.,&#8221; Mondesire said. {snip}</p>
<p>In the future, US Airways workers with diversity complaints can contact the Philadelphia NAACP, which will discuss the cases with airline human-resources personnel, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Jan. 5, alleged a &#8220;pervasive and severe hostile working environment&#8221; for African American US Airways employees at Philadelphia airport and claimed that blacks were discriminated against in hiring, termination, discipline, promotion, and benefits, as well as gate, terminal, and ticket-counter assignments based on color.</p>
<p>The NAACP alleged that US Airways managers referred to airport terminals where African Americans were predominantly assigned by derogatory code names, such as &#8220;Compton&#8221; or &#8220;Camden&#8221; in Terminal C  &mdash;  references to communities composed primarily of minorities  &mdash;  and &#8220;The Ghetto&#8221; in Terminal F.</p>
<p>Areas with more white employees were called &#8220;Frankford/South Philly&#8221; in Terminal B, and &#8220;King of Prussia&#8221; at international Terminals A-West and A-East, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are definitely a diverse airline, I can say that,&#8221; Lehmacher said. &#8220;But we would not talk about the specific breakdown by ethnicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Nooooo Eric!  Diversity all the way.  I&rsquo;m talking black docters, black pilots, black air controllers, black firefighters; hey, we could even let them in off the street since grades and performance don&rsquo;t matter.  </p>
<p>I think we should let them have all the diversity they say they want.  </p>

		<p> So U.S. Airways, instead of &#8220;manning up&#8221; and fighting these shakedown artists, caved in to them like a house of cards. Same old routine, different day. And did anyone note the name of the presiding judge: &#8220;Petrese Tucker&#8221;? Now, I wonder what color SHE is? Or possibly &#8220;he,&#8221; as the names they give their kids are often so weird you can&rsquo;t tell male from female.</p>
<p> The way to stop all these extortionate lawsuits by the NAACP, is to start suing them right back. Readers of AmRen probably get tired of hearing me say that, over and over again, but it&rsquo;s true. Keep them so busy, and strapped, defending themselves against a barrage of lawsuits, that they don&rsquo;t have time to cause trouble for other people any more. Hey, the Bible says, &#8220;As ye sow, so shall ye reap.&#8221; It&rsquo;s about time the NAACP reaped a whirlwind.</p>

		<p>Eric,</p>
<p>I was thinking exactly what you were thinking before I even read your post.  I am so thankful that affirmative action hasn&rsquo;t crept to the cockpit yet.  It terrifies me every time I look in the cockpit while boarding a plane and I see either a woman or a minority sitting up there.  Thank goodness at least one of the pilots is always still a white man.  In fact, well over 90% of the time it still seems to be TWO white men.  And walking around the airports when I am connecting flights, white male pilots are still overwhelmingly what I see. Thank Goodness!</p>
<p>Lord help me the day I look in the cockpit and see two minorities, a woman and a minority, or two women.  If it gets that bad I would probably turn right around and walk off, which is something I have never done before.</p>
<p>As for diversity within the airport terminal itself, yes it seems blacks occupy most of those positions now, at least in airports in the South.  And many of them are foreign blacks too.</p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed how there is always an African or Jamaican of some sort sitting in each of the airport bathrooms with a jar of money?  What do they do anyways other than hand us paper towels when we need them?  They are usually very nice, but I am confused on what their services are and why someone like me should feel pressured to pay them just because I walk to a stall, urinate for 10 seconds, use a little bit of toilet paper, wash my hands with some soap, wipe them with a paper towel, and then maybe use the mirror to make sure I look okay as I am walking out.</p>
<p>I also notice they usually have a foreign minority with an accent of some sort, whether they are black or not, manning the ticket booth.  It disturbs me when they don&rsquo;t ask for my ID like they are supposed to.  The white ones usually do.</p>
<p>It is also usually blacks (I think usually regular American ones, not foreign ones) who handle my luggage, put it on the conveyer belt, and taxi it around outside on the asphalt before loading it onto the airplane. While waiting to board my flight I sit and look out the window and I have seen these black luggage &#8220;taxi drivers&#8221; drop peoples&rsquo; suit cases out on the asphalt due to speeding too fast, and not even noticing until much later. </p>
<p>When looking out the window I also notice that the pilots of the airplane I am about to board (usually white men), are the ones in charge of walking around the plane inspecting everything before take off. Thank goodness for that.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say is, even though I am a woman, I think we should go back to the days of female flight attendants wearing skirts and keeping their appearances attractive.  They should also have good attitudes and smile a lot.  These days the new flight attendant uniform has been down graded to a sweat suit at times. Sheesh!</p>

		<p>One Lawyer says:  &#8220;If we lose this case, you have to pay X amount to the government and Y amount to the NAACP -in addition to- rewarding the plaintiffs&#8221;</p>
<p>A Second Laywer says:  &#8220;I work for the NAACP, we&rsquo;ll cut you a special one-time discount if you just agree to join our bigot&rsquo;s anonymous club and let us shake you down privately every six months&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And The Third Lawyer breaks the tie:  &#8220;As representative of the stockholders association for whatever holding company actually owns U.S. Airlines, I forbid you to risk that much money.  Settle now, quickly, out of court!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the acting managers/CEOs and personnel/union people who are willing to fight to the bitter end to make it clear just how much damage is being done by blacks that they -get- these labels applied to them are shut out of the decision process altogether.</p>
<p>And for the guy who says that the pilots had better stay pale, let me make it clear sir: pilots stand tall on a lot of shoulders.  From the baggage handlers who need to make sure the plane is within weight/CG limits while packing bags at light speed to the fuelers who need to make sure the JetA-1 isn&rsquo;t watered up in the bowser or ramp tank.  To the deicers and the walk around maintenance parties.  To the rapid turn engine changers who work through the night, up to their armpits in carcinogenic fluids, trying to switch out three working engines through four jets.  Even the people running ticket counters who have to get people rapidly and safely herded onto and off of the jet to keep delayed traffice from bottlenecking at the terminal or on final.  While also serving as a last line of defense &#8216;hairy eyeball alert&rsquo; for the odd behaving fanatic.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want incompetence at any level in aviation, especially commercial aviation.</p>
<p>There are quite a few blacks that can accel at those jobs.  That come out of the military thriving on the stress and the energy.  But if it&rsquo;s worth a lawsuit to get those people their just dues, it&rsquo;s worth being public rather than shaking people down behind closed doors.</p>

<p>I respectfully disagree Sir, The end of Affirmative Action is when blacks are forced into the cockpits as pilots. That&rsquo;d be great. Of course, I don&rsquo;t fly at all. but a plane poloted by such people has to come down somewhere, So I&rsquo;d be taking a chance like everyone else, although a smaller chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d think black people would be lining up to get seats on those planes flown by black pilots.</p>

<p>You have me lost.  I have no idea what you are getting at in your first paragraph.  Can you rephrase it, because right now I can&rsquo;t even comprehend what your point is at all.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t agree with your closing sentence (the one thing I DO understand). Blacks won&rsquo;t support affirmative action when it puts their lives on the line.  You and I know that.  I don&rsquo;t know where you are getting these ideas from.  Do blacks enjoy staying in black neighborhoods or do they follow us wherever we go?</p>

		<p>I love to fly. Love it. Or, more accurately, used to. When the airlines actually treated you like humans instead of cargo.</p>
<p>However, I quit flying years ago due to crammed, smaller seats, bad attitudes, unruly passengers, and the shake downs at the security (term used loosely) gates. As a white, fair-skinned, middle-aged American female I refuse - REFUSE - to be searched, patted down and in general treated like an enemy of the State just to fly from one American city to another, while massive numbers of foreigners causally walk across our borders and we legally import obscene numbers of foreigners of the very breed who are trying to wipe us out. It&rsquo;s absolute insanity to think airline security is more important than the foreigners our government allows to swarm and take over our nation. With the overwhelming numbers of Equal Opportunity hires in the terminal side of flying, I knew it was only a matter of time before the ineptness spread to more important parts of aviation. </p>

<p>Just tongue in cheek malarkey. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t express myself too well.</p>
<p>But I stand by my main premise. I&rsquo;d really like to see blacks forced on the airlines as pilots, whether or not they&rsquo;re qualified. I&rsquo;ll add to that, as mechanics too (I&rsquo;m not joking). That&rsquo;d pretty much take care of the Affirmaitve Action baloney real quick.</p>

		<p>One way to avoid these problems is to fly a foreign airline. <br>
Lately, I&rsquo;ve been using Finnair.  Excellent service with a smile; efficient, courteous, all-white crew;  baggage arrives intact; everything goes smoothly.  No problems!  (And  I might add, the stewardesses are invariably pretty too.)</p>
<p>As an American, I regret having to say this, but this is what our national mania for Diversity has done to our competitiveness. American lines are known for  brusk personnel and lousy service; the foreign lines are known for excellence.  No doubt, many other people feel this way (even if they don&rsquo;t admit it). </p>

<p>DIVERSITY IS IN THE COCKPIT.  </p>
<p>What made you think it wasn&rsquo;t?  United had a lawsuit that required them to hire unqualified minorities.  American had a &#8220;females and friends&#8221; hiring policy that also catered to minorities.  Diversity in the cockpit has been around for years.  I am surprised that any regulars around here would think otherwise.</p>

<p>I too have wondered why, in our modern era, it is necessary to have bathroom attendants.  My theory is that they are mainly there not to hand out towels or even mainly to clean, but rather to discourage use of public toilets as convenient places for gay men to meet for sex and for drug users to engage in their pastime.</p>

<p>Okay, you are catastrophizing way too much.  This is what I don&rsquo;t like about the way many of the posters on this website go about things. Yes things are bad, but is it the end of the world yet?  NO. </p>
<p>If things were as bad as you claim they are, there would be more planes crashing in this country and I can guarantee you that I most certainly would never be stepping foot on any airplane and  neither would many other Americans.  I have been on at least 100 American airlines in my lifetime (I am only in my late twenties) and I have never felt unsafe on any of them.  The same goes for every family member of mine who has ever flown in the same time period, let alone every single person I know that flies!<br>

<p>I am a pilot for a major airline.  I know what I am talking about. I didn&rsquo;t say you shouldn&rsquo;t feel safe.  I was just stating facts about the hiring.  Everyone here knows it.  Affirmative action in pilot hiring has been around for decades.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the motivation to at least get some rudimentary training is still a barrier to most incompetents.  Also, aircraft systems are far superior to what they were in the past.</p>
<p>We are told if we are about to hit the ground or another aircraft.  That technology did not exist years ago to the level it does today. </p>

		<p>I fly a lot, and I have seen black pilots and occasionally some female ones.  Not a great many, but they are there. They appeared competent, and I assume they are qualified and fit for the job. Surely an airline would not put an unqualified person in such a vital position in the cockpit. I trust that they are well screened and trained. I did not feel uncomfortable with them. </p>

		<p>I live just outside of Filthydelphia and have flown out of it&rsquo;s airport many times. If any group is underrepresented in any section of the airport it is whites. The airport is literally crawling with black employees and they literally control everything that goes on there. This lawsuit is an insult of the highest order. Only when whites are exterminated will blacks be happy. I am sick of this constantly caving in to this pathetic races never ending whining and complaining about non-existent white oppression. </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting observation; I have seen the same thing. In fact, a whole black community seems to grow up around large airports. This is true from Seatac in Seattle, to JFK in New York, to DeGaulle in Paris. Every large international airport seems to attract blacks and create a new Harlem around it.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, many of those airport services and jobs are controlled by <i>foreign  </i>blacks (such as Ethiopians and Somalis in Minneapolis), rather than native blacks. They have nearly a monopoly in MSP.  And the Algerians in Paris. Probably Pakistanis in London.  I should add that a great many of them are Moslems. (Even in Ottawa and Vancouver there are Somalis at the airport.)  This does not bode well for security, despite all our government&rsquo;s elaborate pretenses of protecting us.  What good are all those fancy, expensive screening devices as well as the intrusive searches and pat-downs when there are Somalis all over the airport?  </p>
<p>Ah, but you can&rsquo;t discriminate, can you?  What idiocy!<br>
We&rsquo;re just sitting ducks. This is the price we pay for Diversity. (Obviously, somebody in the background feels this price is worth it.)</p>
