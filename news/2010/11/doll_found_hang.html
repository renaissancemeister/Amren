<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/01/AR2010110106604.html">Doll Found Hanging From Noose at Church</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Zapotosky, Washington Post, November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A maintenance man found the doll, which was hanging from a tree in front of the City of Zion Church, about 7:30 a.m. Sunday, said Gregory Strong, the pastor. Someone had written racial slurs on the doll, along with references to President Obama, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Strong said he called police, and the doll was removed before congregants arrived for services. He said he thought the doll was meant to scare congregants in the days before Tuesday&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not coincidence,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jim Collins, a Laurel police spokesman, said that officers collected fingerprints from the doll and rope and remained in the area, undercover, looking for suspects. There were no leads Monday, he said.</p>
<p>He said the words used and the way they were written indicated that the incident was not an act of teenage vandalism but an orchestrated effort by an adult. {snip}</p>

<i>&#8220;Laurel police were trying Monday to determine who hung a doll from a noose in front of an African American church&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Who indeed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet if we ever find out, we&rsquo;re all supposed to learn an important lesson. </p>

		<p>Hmmm..Fingerprints from a rope? Never head of that one before and I spent a large portion my career in a forensic investigation unit. Sounds like another of those incidents where someone of color is trying to gin up some racist sentiment against whites. Whatever.</p>

		<p>Naturally I&rsquo;m willing to bet that it was a hoax perpetrated by a black person who felt that white folk needed some sensitizing, and that it would be fun to see the media preach about the evils of white racism yet again.  I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone here will take the other side of the bet.<br/>

		<p>In the NY Daily Post today there was a story about a local cabbie (Greek American) who was scattering little notes about killing jews all along his route through jewish neighborhoods.  </p>
<p>When he was finally caught he said that he wanted to inflame the jews against the muslims.  I presume he hates muslims due to the greek/turkish rivalry.  </p>
<p>In any case, it shows how people purposefully do things to promote racial hatred.  How many nooses and bad messages have been found to be hoaxes done by liberals to frame whites as evil racists? </p>

<p>Flag burning is &#8220;free speech,&#8221; but apparently this is a federal crime.</p>
<p>Okay, it was done a couple of days before the election, so presumably it was an act of voter intimidation. And yet, Obama&rsquo;s Justice Department dropped a voter intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party in which two Black Panthers in paramilitary garb brandished a nightstick near a polling place and made racial threats.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say what color the doll was, meaning it was probably a caucasian doll.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that the perp was a Bantu. I just can&rsquo;t see a white going into a Bantu neighborhood in D.C., simply to hang a doll in front of a Bantu church. A white in that neighborhood would stand out like a polar bear in a field of coal.</p>

		<p>Like the other article posted about &#8220;racist graffiti&#8221; the actual writing was considered so horrible that it was not directly quoted. Obviously it was considered so horribly upsetting to blacks it was cloaked as &#8220;adult orchestrated&#8221; to paraphrase. I grew up in the deep south and a dummy dressed as a Union Soldier hanging was a common Halloween decoration. Chances are this is another hoax.</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight.  We need to investigate a noose when we have no proof it was a white person, yet the DOJ won&rsquo;t prosecute the Black Panthers for an obvious racial civil rights violation that was caught on camera?  Okay&hellip;.</p>

<p>I would image a lot of them, especially since painting Whites as racists is more considered &#8216;consciousness raising&rsquo; than racial hatred and considered a good thing. This story reminded me of the previous president. If something made fun of president bush, such as showing him in the image of a chimp, etc, it was considered amusing and perhaps hip and cutting edge. <br/>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised that, if caught, the person who did this is black.  It&rsquo;s happened many times before with the intent of advancing the myth of how much whites hate blacks.  If not identified then whites are put in the position of defending against the notion of &#8220;but I never beat my wife&#8221;. </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s funny is if a white person committed this crime, it will be denounced as racism and a call to do something. If a minority is caught perpetrating this is a hoax, he wont be punished even harder, for this attempt to raise hatred against whites, or even for just committing the crime. . no, the incident in this case will also be seen as a call to do something and to fight against white racism. After all, it could have happened. It offers us another chance to highlight this important &#8216;issue&rsquo; - that of whites behaving badly. </p>

<p><br/>
No, it was not a coincidence. It was most likely done by the people in the church. It was used to scare blacks into voting for candidates who favored blacks. Maybe the DNC did it.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s stunning to me that such childish symbols, though they may be in bad taste, still have such an impact. It&rsquo;s an embellished impact so as to desperately cling to their guaranteed pot of gold. </p>
<p>Personally, if I saw something like that in my yard, I&rsquo;d just shake my head, take it down, throw it in the trash and go on about my business.</p>

<p>Or for that matter, how many liberal programs have demonized Whites in the media, and on the university campuses? Or diversity brainwashing sessions on the job or in schools? <br/>
