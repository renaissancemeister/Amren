<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The head of the U.N. Commission for Human Rights says nations should expand opportunities for legal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although states have legitimate interests in securing their borders and exercising immigration controls, such concerns do not trump the obligations of the state to respect the internationally guaranteed rights of all persons,&#8221; said Navi Pillay, U.N. high commissioner for human rights.<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Pillay said nation states must halt criminalization of international migrants, an estimated 214 million people globally, and lower barriers preventing legal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The principle of non-discrimination is fundamental in international human rights law and runs across all international human rights instruments inspired by the Universal Declaration (of Human Rights), notable the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,&#8221; she said. </p>

Many persons here may not have heard of Navanethem Pillay.<br>
&#8220;Navi&#8221; Pillay is a member of the Indian community of South Africa. She is actually a Tamil(Ceylonese)  by descent. <br>
 <br>
As a lawyer in South Africa, she fought Apartheid and represented Nelson Mandela.  When he came to power, Mandela nominated Pillay as the first non-white woman to serve on the High Court of South Africa. She is rated by Forbes as the 64th most powerful woman in the world.<br>

		<p>I absolutely DETEST the UN! It was set up in the first place to demonize European nations and peoples and especially White America! It was set up to destroy us economically, transfer our wealth to the 3rd world peoples, to flood our lands with nonwhites by the hundreds of millions, to promote White genocide through miscegenation and anti-White crimes from these &#8220;immigrants&#8221;.</p>
<p> WE had better realize just how evil the UN is and what their agenda really is and stop them dead in their tracks. What will it take to shake Whites out of their stupor? You would think by now that most Whites would have awoken to what is being perpetrated against us and the reason why. But, no, most Whites are still in denial.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see, first they say states have legitimate interests in securing their borders and exercising immigration controls, then they say they say nation states must halt criminalizing international migrants. So if a country cannot make it a crime to immigrate unlawfully what is the point of all this? In the UN scenario, a nation can&rsquo;t exercise immigration control if it&rsquo;s not a crime to illegaly enter another country. Another example of the lunacy coming out of the UN.</p>

		<p>This is the sort of statement we can expect from the UN.</p>
<p>The UN is an unelected left-leaning organisation, the majority of it&rsquo;s members are 3rd world nations, many of which are little better than corrupt, incompetent overpopulated dictatorships.</p>
<p>The UN has no right to tell individual sovereign nations how to run their affairs.</p>
<p>Obviously the UN would like nations such as the USA, Canada, Australia etc, nations which have rule of law and generous welfare to take in unlimited numbers from Africa South Asia etc. What happens when the pot of welfare gold runs out? What about the social cost of unrestricted immigration? I think many EU nations are already finding this out the hard way.</p>
<p>I think it is time for the UN to re-evaluate it&rsquo;s very existence.</p>

<p>Well, what about the right to self-determination? Should a nation not be allowed to determine who to let into their country? Why should the &#8220;principle of non-discrimination&#8221; negate the principle of self-determination?</p>

		<p>9mmMax - good ideas, but for one thing.  The UN does not own the building and grounds it inhabits.  The US pays over one half of it&rsquo;s funding, and the US owns the land.  I pray daily that the next President is fed up with the UN, pulls us out unilaterally, abrogates all treaties signed previously, boots them OFF our land, ceases all funding, and tells them to go to hell.  In short, pretty much what Japan did with the League of Nations.  Except We own the land and pay half the costs of the UN, and without US, they cease to exist.  Time they made do with whatever funding their beloved third world nations care to provide.  I hear land can be got cheap in Haiti.  Let them go there.</p>

You should be delighted to support millions of third-world parasites with your taxes. Also gratefully, joyfully endure the crime and social problems which are an inseparable part of massive immigration. Listen to our enlightened liberals who know what&rsquo;s best for us [NOT]!</p>

		<p>1.  No free race should adhere to &#8220;international obligations&#8221; unless they are clearly in that race&rsquo;s interest (i.e., test visitors from abroad for AIDS or tuberculosis).</p>
<p>2. And just where are these &#8220;obligations&#8221; found? Certainly not in any treaty ratified by the US.  We legally I suppose, admit &#8220;refugees&#8221;, but we don&rsquo;t have to, and we shouldn&rsquo;t, given the gross abuse of that term by would-be immigrant Africans and Latin Americans, and now everyone in the Middle East, who wants to make a fast buck in the US. </p>

<p>The first sentence in the above referenced link provides us with a definition of a refugee:<br>
&#8220;a refugee is a person who (according to the formal definition in article 1A of this Convention), &#8220;owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmm, seems like the first Europeans to settle here (Pilgrims) could be classified as refugees.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Hmm, seems like the first Europeans to settle here (Pilgrims) could be classified as refugees.&#8221;</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>No quite!  They did not come here seeking the protection of this country. On the contrary, there was no &#8220;country&#8221; to come to or protect them, until they founded it. There was only a wilderness, with no government, no laws. And many Indian tribes warring among themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, they were not being &#8220;persecuted&#8221; in England. In fact, England was trying its best to be tolerant towards the various bickering religious groups, to maintain the peace and keep them from each other&rsquo;s throats.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Puritans objected to the laxity and tolerance of the English government, which they considered wicked and godless.  They wanted a MORE STRICT (and intolerant) government. So they came here to found their own, where only their beliefs and way of life would be allowed, no tolerance given to others.   Later, they even exiled dissenters from their own midst (to Rhode Island and Connecticut) and even burned some.  THEY were the ones who did the persecuting!  </p>
<p>They were not refugees; others were refugees from them!  (Check out Roger Williams and Anne Huchinson.)</p>
<p>[..most colonies enforced a uniformity at least as strict as in the country they had left. There was considerable Puritan intolerance in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Hutchinson&rsquo;s particular &#8220;heresy&#8221; was to maintain that it was a blessing and not a curse to be a woman.]Wiki</p>

<p>Yes.  I think that a great part of immigration practices of the WEst are perpetrated by Capitalists partnered with Marxists for their mutual benefit.  Filling cities and towns with strangers break up communities and families, creating bueaucractic offices to assist this using &#8220;Diversity&#8221; programs is all part of the game.  Isolate people in the midst of stangers and they won&rsquo;t be able to rely on anyone but the government.  And if that government decides to abandon you, you just die out.  </p>
<p>Nazis did this in WW2 with their concentraiton camps.  They avoided imprisoning people in camps near their hometowns.  So Yugoslavs were plentiful in France and French were plentiful in Yugoslavia, etc.  So even if someone escaped, they were not in familiar territory and were not likely to have sympathetic parties nearby.  That&rsquo;s is an example of the strategy in a direct fashion.  What is going on the West today is a more complex model, but the same principal.<br>

<p>Here is a better definition of a &#8216;refugee&rsquo;   &mdash;   and the one used by the US:</p>
<p><i>Congress can name whatever group it wants to be refugees.</i></p>
<p>Here are a few more &#8216;fun&rsquo; facts about the UN pushing 3rd world refugees on the US:</p>
<p> In recent years up to 95% of the refugees coming to the U.S. were referred by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or were the relatives of UN-picked refugees&hellip;The U.N. is effectively dictating much of U.S. immigration policy.</p>
<p>UN personnel often sell access to the program and once here refugees make false claims of family relationship in order to facilitate wider immigration. </p>
<p>And lastly:</p>
<p>In Fiscal Year 2009 the U.S. resettled almost three times as many refugees as all the rest of the countries in the industrialized world combined.　</p>

<p>our government spends loads of taxpayer money and uses our churches to sponsor refugee relocation and temporary assistance.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intelligent program for ya - with unemployment on the rise, lets bring 3rd worlders into the country with absolutely no chance of gaining employment capable of paying their own way.  Then expect the sponsor communities to pick up the tab through social services after the &#8220;migration loan&#8221; runs dry.</p>
