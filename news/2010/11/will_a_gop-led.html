<h1>Will A GOP-Led House Mean The End of &#8216;Sanctuary Cities&rsquo;?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elise Foley, Washington Independent, Nov. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), who is expected to run the House Judiciary Committee, has spoken out against these cities, claiming they violate a 1996 law that expanded the government&rsquo;s reach on illegal immigration. After the Justice Department decided to sue Arizona for taking on immigration enforcement with SB 1070, conservatives argued there should be a similar crackdown on sanctuary cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the Justice Department to suggest that they won&rsquo;t take action against those who passively violate the law  &mdash;  who fail to comply with the law  &mdash;  is absurd,&#8221; Smith, the chief author of the 1996 immigration law, told The Washington Times in July. &#8220;Will they ignore individuals who fail to pay taxes? Will they ignore banking laws that require disclosure of transactions over $10,000? Of course not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 1996 law, the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act, requires local governments to cooperate with immigration enforcement authorities. Most lawmakers in sanctuary cities  &mdash;  San Francisco being one notable exception  &mdash;  deny that the label applies to their city&rsquo;s policies because they do not prevent immigration authorities from policing immigration in their areas. They claim their policies are meant to enhance public safety by making undocumented immigrants feel comfortable about reporting crime to the police or seeking help from health officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s possible Smith will attempt a bill explicitly banning sanctuary-style policies. Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the pro-enforcement Federation for American Immigration Reform, told TWI that his organization hopes to see the Republicans in the House take a tough stand against sanctuary policies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>GOP House members might also try to pass legislation specifically giving states the right to crack down on immigration, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates stricter enforcement. &#8220;They might propose a bill to specifically assert states&rsquo; authority to participate in immigration enforcement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I could see that passing the House relatively easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>That type of law, though, is far less likely to gain support from Democrats. Krikorian said he was almost certain such a bill would be vetoed by Obama, if it were able to get past Senate at all.<br>

<p>So maybe the incoming US House of Representatives should simply withhold any new funding of any kind to the US Government, as Article I, Section 7 of the US Constitution stipulates they can: &ldquo;All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.&rdquo; This does not mean &ldquo;shutting down&rdquo; the federal government, only a freeze on raising new revenue. I am not a lawyer, but this does seem to be a constitutional maneuver worth trying, while also looking at introducing articles of impeachment on the grounds of treason for those elected officials that refuse to enforce standing immigration law, even up to and including the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Just a thought,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

<p>Can he House do much so far as passing bills are concerned, as long as the community organizer can veto them?</p>
<p>There could be investigations in the house that might cause heads to roll, and there&rsquo;s a lot that can be done in refusing to fund various bills already passed, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Republicans will try to do what a lot of the rank and file want, knowing they&rsquo;re being closely watched, but they&rsquo;re limited in what they can do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see them work to bring out the racist side of Obama, though.  He&rsquo;s an arrogant egotist.  If he&rsquo;s pressured intensely without let up, I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;ll crack and show a really ugly true self.<br>

		<p>There is a linear relationship between how many illegal aliens are in a city and how much money is spent on public services.  The two go hand in hand.  There is also a linear relationship between the number of leftists / socialists and their need to cultivate ethnic allies (latino shock troops).  Not only will defunding hurt sacntuary cities but it will target ground zero or the leftist heartland where it hurts them most.  Huzzah!  </p>

<p>Good!  Let&rsquo;s get this dog and pony show on the road.  Let TOTUS veto bill after bill after bill.  Push him to do it, hard.</p>

		<p>Forcing Obama to either sign or veto such bills is an excellent way to cause a rift between either him and the far left and pro-illegal Hispanics or between him and most of America.  In either event, he will be finished as far as reelection. <br>
In the new Senate, there will be more Repubs, of course  &mdash;  as well as right-leaning Senators like WV&rsquo;s Joe Manchin.  A majority for such a bill might be possible, and when leftist Dems filibuster, Fox News and right-wing radio will be full of stories about this and that Senator being on the side of illegals.  If the bill passes, Obama will be on the hot seat.  And he&rsquo;s no Bill Clinton.</p>

		<p>NumbersUSA has confirmed that we now have a majority of anti-immigration politicians in the House and enough in the Senate to pass just about anything with a little wheeling and dealing.  A dramatic change that will become very useful, immediately, if people are willing to engage in minimal effort to lobby their politicians.</p>
<p>Now is the time to move in for the kill with these issues.  Pass tough new laws to force the immigration issue to be addressed.  These bills will be presented immediately and will work their way up in intensity over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>First up, it seems, is ending sanctuary cities.  A fine choice.</p>
<p>Understand that you have the ability to answer the question, will there be an end to sanctuary cities?  The house will easily pass such a bill.  However, to make it law you (you personally) are going to have to demand it of the senate and demand that Obama not veto it.  Both are spineless and will easily fold with enough pressure.</p>
<p>So join NumbersUSA.  Send faxes non-stop that they provide you.  Call.  Show up at town hall meetings.  Make it clear you want the immigrants gone and that your voice is a heck of alot louder than La Raza.</p>
<p>And you will get results.  Now is the time.  We gained substantial ground recently and have strong momentum.</p>
<p>Time to press the advantage.</p>

		<p>While the House may <i>finally</i> pass some laws that would promote bona fide immigration law enforcement we still have a Democratic Senate and the most left wing President in history.  So such bills are unlikely to pass the Senate and if passed will be vetoed by Obama.  We are stuck for at least two years.  But watch the Republicans offer up another unpalatable candidate (Sarah Palin, say) and hand the next Presidential election to Hillary Clinton.  The Evil Party may turn off white voters, but the Stupid Party can&rsquo;t attract them.</p>

		<p>If Federal Judges refuse to allow us to enforce the law, or if they refuse to enforce the law then impeach these judges.  Who says Congress cannot impeach hundreds of judges who refuse to take their oaths seriously.  Most of the 9th Circuit Court needs to be impeached.  Let this be our destiny.</p>

<p>There is no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties. Having spent sometime inside the belt way myself I can assure my friends here that outside of the posturing for votes most Democrats and Republicans socialize together and have similar political views. </p>
<p>The real demarcation is between the Hamiltonians [strong central governments] and the Jeffersonians strong state governments].</p>
<p>Of course Obama, along with his so called economic gurus, all of whom are abysmally incompetent, have destroyed this country beyond all recognition.  Were I to have my way I would immediately put Ron Paul in charge of the country but I think even with so bold a move it is probably too late. </p>
<p>The secret is not outlawing the cities but rather outlawing &#8220;free&#8221; social services and fining employers who hire them. That, plus the fact, that they can make more money in Mexico than here will automatically solve the problem - but their employers have political clout and politicians want both their money and the Hispanic votes. Nothing will change.</p>
<p>If you think this year has been bad economically just wait until next year when all of the liar loan mortgages begin reseting. Already there is talk of a QE IV.</p>
<p>You only get to kick the can down the road for so long until, sooner or later, the can will come back to kick you! </p>

		<p>MoMo - Very well said.  Regardless of the hype, the two major parties are fundamentally very similar on the things that really matter.  The next few years are going to be interesting, but it&rsquo;s my hope that nationalist (A3P perhaps?) political movements here in the US can gain at least the level of participation and support that they are in Europe.  For now, Bubba is content to swill beer and watch sports while cursing at the &#8220;liberals&#8221; when something political comes up.</p>

		<p>I doubt there will ever be any effort to denying illegal aliens sanctuary anywhere in the U.S. on the part of Republicans. The rich want the cheap labor and wealthy whites do not care about or have any racial solidarity with less fortunate whites. Ultimately, that could ensure our demise literally as a race. Nay, the only way illegals will be driven out of &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221; will be whites driving them out by force. It&rsquo;s getting to the point where whites are going to need sanctuary cities to protect themselves from these vile invaders, one of which was arrested for bursting into a white family&rsquo;s home and stabbing a 4-year old boy to death. It us who need a safe sanctuary, not these illegal alien invaders.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind that the secure fence act of 2006 passed with veto-proof majorities in the house (283-138) and senate (80-19.) (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Fence_Act_of_2006)<br>
   Granted the GOP had a slim majority in the senate unlike at present, but cracking down on sanctuary cities seems like a less drastic measure than requiruing the constuction of 700 miles of double layered fence. (which has yet to be compeleted, btw) Moderate and conservative Politicians need to have their feet held to the fire on immigration, including things like birthright citizenship.  The clock is ticking, time is running out. Do we want the country to resemble Brazil?! </p>

<p>Yes, inevitably so.  They are The Establishment.  They are just two sides of <i>The Establishment Party. </i>  They trade power back and forth among themselves, periodically, but keep it away from outsiders.  And naturally, they will defend each others&rsquo; interests (which are not really that far apart on most basic issues). They may bicker about  trivia and minutiae (and make much ado about it);  but when it comes down to stuff that has by now come to be considered basic to the American ideology, there is little or no disagreement &hellip;nor even discussion.  (Immigration, integration, miscegenation, affirmative action, Middle East wars, hate speech laws,  etc.,etc.)  Where is the difference?  We need a complete housecleaning! But they have the system locked up and will never allow that. It is a closed system guaranteeing that the insiders remain inside, and the outsiders stay out.</p>

		<p>Since all spending bills originate in the House and the Republicans control the House it is really quite simple, if the Republicans have the backbone. They need to simply cut off any government funding to sanctuary cities.They also need to cut off federal funding to schools that admit illegal immigrants and La Raza. </p>

		<p>Regarding the notion of &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221;, I am almost at a loss for words to discuss it. It is simply boggling and baffling to me that our country has degenerated so far that there even is such an issue tormenting us. Other countries must marvel to observe our decomposition, the helplessness of Uncle Sam to control his own territory (while he tries to bully the world).  The great and powerful USA cannot even control its own cities! The provinces are dictating to the metropolis.</p>
<p>It is baffling to me that there are cities which chose to conduct themselves in the manner of independent little principalities which follow their own policies in defiance of the federal government. And more baffling, that they allowed to get away with it by a passive or indifferent Uncle Sam! And mind-boggling too that federal authorities themselves, even the president, simply place themselves above the law, above their oaths, and refuse to enforce their own laws! Worse still, they try to punish those states that do attempt to follow the law!  Is this still a &#8220;nation of laws&#8221;, as we have always been told (in proud and bragging tones)?  What law do we have, when there is no one to uphold the law? </p>
<p>So this the degree to which our &#8220;union&#8221; has fallen   &mdash;   that everyone is going their own way, giving Uncle Sam the finger!  Uncle Sam himself has become such a hypocrite that he doesn&rsquo;t even enforce his own laws, so why should anyone else respect them?  And if you can now  pick and choose your laws, why should anyone comply with any?  Why not disregard them all? It&rsquo;s everyone for himself.</p>
<p>It was not always so! Can you imagine any mere municipality refusing to participate in WW1 or WW2, offering &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; to Nazis?  The mayor, administration, entire city council, judiciary, etc. would have found themselves under arrest, instantly, and in prison for treason. The city would be under occupation by troops and the administration taken over by federal authorities.</p>
<p>Is the contined flow of federal dollars the only thing still holding us together?   When that shuts off and there are no more bail-outs and the dollar has become worthless,  will everything fall apart?  Are we  as a nation going to continue to decompose gradually, and just crumble apart softly   &mdash;   as the Soviet Union did?  Or, when it comes, will it be violent and bloody   &mdash;   as with Yugoslvaia?  We shall see.</p>
<p>Well, I did think of a few words after all.  This amazing situation boggles my mind, but not my tongue. It recalls the decline and collapse of the Roman Empire, which fell not in a day, and from within as much as from without. When/if the  formerly great and proud USA, grown feeble and helpless,  does collapse, we can be sure the world&rsquo;s jackals will be circling around to enjoy the feast. That&rsquo;s when the real nightmare begins. Let us be ready.  We former Americans may chose to be  tolerant and generous toward each other, but we can expect no mercy from the jackals.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Correct, but I wouldn&rsquo;t quite say &#8220;never&#8221;.<br>
  <br>
At one time it was realized that German was becoming established in the South because of the large number of German immigrants there. Brazil quickly put a stop to that and required only Portuguese   &mdash;   quite the opposite of us with our multilingual teachers and  multyculty &#8220;outreach&#8221;  programs.  </p>
<p>Brazil had no use for multi-culturalism and made it clear to all immigrants that they were one country with one language. Period. That is why they don&rsquo;t have any language problems today, and all the Germans there speak Portuguese.</p>
