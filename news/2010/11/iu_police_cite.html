<h1>IU Police Cite Race in Attack on Asian Students</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Indianapolis Star, November 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Indiana University police say a group of African Americans used racial slurs before attacking and robbing a group of Asian students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a news release, university police say eight Asian students were walking to a dorm on the Bloomington campus when five black males and three black females approached them.</p>
<p>Police say the blacks used anti-Chinese slurs and words were exchanged.</p>
<p>Police say four of the Asians were assaulted or robbed. They say one was treated at a hospital for facial injuries and released.</p>

		<p>This report is a lie!  Don&rsquo;t you know that blacks CANNOT be racists!  All the blacks I ever heard talk about this say so!</p>
<p>The clueless Indiana police are in need of diversity training ASAP!</p>
<p>Those Asians were just random victims!  Why, they could have been attacked by anybody, even whites!  (Oh snap, then it would be a racist hate crime.)  </p>
<p>Uh, oooh, I got it: The Asians must have used the &#8220;N&#8221; word first, provoking the blacks and inflaming their wounded pride!</p>
<p>Wait, what about the wonders of diversity and the vibrancy of it all?  I guess we had better fund a million dollar study!  We had better send more funding to the black community so they have enriched self-esteem, because obviously they were only acting out of pent-up anger at white racism!</p>
<p>Oh, brother.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, among themselves, they refer to even whites as animals or sub-fully human. To black thinking, I suppose that makes things even. If there&rsquo;s even a rumor an Asian person said something about a black, it&rsquo;s more than justified for them to do one of these beatdowns. What a coincidence. Our leaders feel the same way. Words spoken against blacks are taken more seriously and treated more harshly than physical violence committed by them against others.  </p>

		<p>At Illinois State University, only ~ 9% of the student body is Black, but 3/4 of the recent assaults, robberies, and muggings are by blacks.  Lately, groups of Black females have been attacking single white females, beating them and stealing their purses.</p>
<p>Likewise at the University of Illinois, blacks go on &#8220;polar bear hunts,&#8221; randomly attacking lone whites and beating them. </p>
<p>This is the nature of Africans.  You cannot change it   &mdash;   it is in their genes.  Anywhere on earth, where Africans congregate, you will find violence. </p>

		<p>How comes it that the worst thing blacks complain about is always that someone treated them in a racist way or just looked at them in a racist way,</p>
<p>where else none-blacks always complain about being insulted AND being beaten down or attacked by blacks? </p>

<p>They better have it on tape, otherwise they&rsquo;ll never catch anyone.  Asking other blacks for leads will get them nowhere.  In Orlando we have a couple of mostly black areas.  Crime is always high, and often there are dozens of bystanders.  But when the cops ask, no one ever sees anything.  I&rsquo;ve decided that blacks, on average, are unable to remember anything about their surroundings.  Wonder why?</p>

		<p>Frequently, black groups of &#8216;youths&rsquo; confront whites, or now Asians, taunt them, and then rob them. We all are used to verbal taunts between different races-this was common between different white immigrant groups prior to and even after WWII. But I don&rsquo;t recall from personal experience, and I&rsquo;ve had some in verbal battles, and my Dad did decades ago, that whites robbed each other after calling members of the other nationality-well choose your non-PC moniker. Did we fight? Sure. With fists. Mostly, just profanities and &#8220;slurs&#8221;, as they are now termed by the PC elite.</p>
<p>Do blacks do this as a planned prelude to robbery, or do they just rob people they decide to insult as part of the confrontation? It makes of course no difference-this  African race lacks any concepts of private property as a right as important as speech or &#8220;equality&#8221;. But this robbery/nonsense didn&rsquo;t happen between feuding whites.</p>

<p>The other 1/4th of robberies being by other vital people of color? More and more of these anger beat downs, that don&rsquo;t involve robbery, seem to be by black women against what other not properly respectful women there are. Blacks are always about respect and good manners&hellip;  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a long standing &#8220;sport&#8221;. Happens all over but the Asian angle made it just slightly different and thus passed the censors. If they are foreign exchange students then they can appeal to the ambassador of their country to request greater police protection, and get it, to avoid having the US image abroad be sullied. Students and bookworm types are easy prey and that is what draws these thugs. It&rsquo;s not enough fun to merely beat the victims up, they have to taunt and humiliate the victims. For icing on the cake they&rsquo;ll not only rob them, just for the payday, but rape them also if circumstances permit.   </p>

		<p>Again we have the instance of the big strapping Bantu attacking the much smaller Asian kids. The bully in action. The predatory mentality, finding the least path of resistance. Deriving a perverse pleasure of being a bully - - all the time a latent coward to boot. I am so impressed over and over with the Bantu. If I just could be just like them! OH YES!</p>

<p>As Martin Amis wrote in &#8216;London Fields&rsquo;, &#8220;&hellip;racketeering meant fighting with black people about drugs - and black people are better at fighting than white people, because, among other reasons, they all do it (there aren&rsquo;t any civilians).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;black groups of &lsquo;youths&rsquo; confront, taunt, and then rob&hellip;Do blacks do this as a planned prelude to robbery, or do they just rob people they decide to insult as part of the confrontation?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>A partial explanation is &#8216;checking&rsquo;.  Black criminals check potential victims for vulnerability.  Had the eight (!) Asian students responded loudly in authentic Oakland housing project argot the blacks would have moved to other potential targets.  </p>
<p>Or, if the Asians had been body builders, or displayed weapons, or threw bananas in one direction and ran in another direction.  Or, if Asians developed the habit of simply shooting any black who approached them, then blacks, though averse to education, would eventually learn to be wary of approaching Asians.  I think Oprah did a show about it.       </p>

		<p>Indiana University is amazing; they&rsquo;ve been able to increase their African-American student population from 4.3% in 2007 to 7.2% in 2009!  It&rsquo;s right there on their Website, under the &#8220;Diversity&#8221; section  &mdash;  see &#8220;Fast Facts&#8221;&hellip; Sadly, the moral glory of their diversity data does not include graduation rate statistics.  </p>

__   __   __   __   __   </p>
<p>Of course! You are absolutely right, Jay.  Anybody who&rsquo;s had some edjumication knows that. Those Indiana police should be sued for making false allegations against a minority. ANYONE can be a victim;  it just HAPPENED that Asians came walking along at that moment. It was only a coincidence. This was just a random crime of desperation&hellip;. What is this nonsense about BLACK crime?   This has NOTHING to do with race.</p>
<p>And if the blacks truly did attack them (which I even doubt) then it was  only because they were FORCED to do so out of poverty and desperation   &mdash;   poverty inflicted by a cruel racist system run by whites. It was an understanbable reaction against a lifetime of  racist oppression and abuse.  Who could blame them for such a natural response? Everyone knows that blacks are peaceful and gentle by nature. In normal circumstances they don&rsquo;t do such things! Look in your newspaper and see how many black crimes you can find.  Probably none!  It was just unfortunate in this rare case that Asians got in the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s elementary.  Any fool who&rsquo;s been to Sociology 101 knows that much.</p>

_____________</p>
<p>Yes, I have noticed that. I noticed it even back in the 50s and 60s. </p>
<p>California blacks, in particular, were uninhibited, loud, and accustomed to doing whatever they pleased without any concern for the opinions of whites or any worry about the authorities.  They were &#8220;emancipated&#8221;! (i.e. out of control) Southern blacks by contrast were better behaved and more controlled. They knew they couldn&rsquo;t get away with violence and rowdyness.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nauseating to watch the ads for the re-make of &#8220;Karate Kid.&#8221; Is there anything more ludicrous and 180 degrees opposite reality than the concept of a black being bullied and discriminated against by low IQ Asians?</p>

		<p>I,m sure many of your readers have noticed like me, that blacks have no respect for anything, if it interferes with their &#8220;plans&#8221;.  They are rude in traffic, and rude in public places. Of course they think whites won&rsquo;t say anything, but geuss I&rsquo;m not only too old to care about what others think, I&rsquo;m a former Marine and originally grew up in New York City.  More and more, I see evidence that  blacks just can&rsquo;t function in western civilization; nor do they want to. Just the other day, as a police car was speeding up a neighborhood street with its emergency lights and sirens on, the obnoxious black driver behind me could&rsquo;nt be bothered to stop for emergency vehicles as the law requires. Instead he cursed me out for stopping and swung around me to continue on his merry way. Wish I bothered to get his tag number.  Utimately my point is, that whites have got to expect decent behaviour of any form from blacks: it just won&rsquo;t happen.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never known blacks to be too particular about who they steal from. Good grief, they kill more of their own more than any other race. Anyone who has something they want is fair game.</p>
<p>GNW #20, they kill each other more in the South than other races simply because there are more of them than other races. They are among more of their own kind. Again, anyone who has something they want is fair game.</p>

<p>Very true. I believe the main reason is that many Southern Whites are armed. I have never heard of any polar bear hunting incidents in the deep South, I am sure it might occur in some of the urban yuppie areas but even that seems to be quite rare.<br>

		<p>Indiana University may have increased FRESHMAN enrollment of blacks, but it remains to be seen how many of those blacks will be there for their sophomore year. From my experience, loud, troublemaking blacks were gone by the end of the first year in college. They were not there for the second year. In some way, most (but, to be fair, not all) were trouble makers in some way. If they didn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t resort to physical violence, they resorted to nasty gossip, rumors (often untrue),name calling, bad mouthing, and the most vicious backstabbing I have ever seen. It was something for which I was not prepared. I can only think of two black students who were studious and not vicious. Just two. <br>
The few Latino students were about as bad, even the ones from Latin America. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because in the South, you can carry a gun or mace in many places and Southern men on average are more likely to fight. Of course, it happens on occasion in the South but it&rsquo;s much,much more frequent up North.</p>

		<p>A few thoughts..</p>
<p>I would bet my bottom dollar those Asian students were much smaller then the attacking blacks. They seem to have an almost predatory-like instinct to find the weakest target like a lion running down the weakest animal in a herd.</p>
<p>I always thought it curious that the great race riots of the 1960&rsquo;s occurred in cities well outside of the deep south - Watts in L.A. in 1965, Detroit in 1967 etc - while the southern places seemed relatively quiet.</p>
