			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Al Lewis, Dow Jones Newswires, November 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bank of America has reached an undisclosed settlement with an African-American contract employee who quit her job after a manager wore a white hood to work during a &#8220;crazy hat&#8221; celebration.</p>
<p>Lisa House, who worked in the bank&rsquo;s Greenwood Village, Colo., office as a contract mortgage closer, said she was terrified and reduced to tears by the sight of a Ku Klux Klan-like hood. And when she complained, she said she got a less-than-sincere apology.</p>
<p>She quit her job and turned to Denver civil rights activist Alvertis Simmons, who brought her complaint to Dow Jones Newswires. The complaint was never brought to court.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have met with Mrs. House and Mr. Simmons. We take their concerns very seriously and have taken appropriate action to address those concerns,&#8221; Bank of America spokeswoman Kelly Sapp said Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, we will continue to provide resources and sensitivity training to the associate and others at the site,&#8221; Sapp said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Simmons said, &#8220;That shows that Bank of America cares about the black community.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Trust me, she wasn&rsquo;t terrified when she saw the unfortunate costume, she was ecstatic.  This is what the black community calls &#8220;winning the lottery.&#8221;  If you throw a racism accusation against a corporation like B of A, no matter the absurd nature of it, more likely than not they will quickly pay out.  </p>

		<p>I question the sanity of an employee who would wear a 3k hood to work although I seriously doubt that it was anything even close. I also have to wonder at the maturity of an adult that would burst into tears at a hat. Likely the other poster was right and her tears were tears or joy!</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the trouble with having Blacks in the workplace. White&rsquo;s have to walk on eggs and weigh their every word and action to make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t offend any low-functioning descendants of grass hut dwellers. </p>
<p>Six or seven years ago while I was contracting at an engineering shop in Macon, Georgia my sister bought an old trunk at a yard sale in Gray, Georgia. The trunk was packed full of old clothes and papers. When she started emptying the trunk my sister found a pointy old white hate and a matching white one-piece pullover robe that had an a hand-embroidered round patch on the left side of the area that covered the chest.</p>
<p>She allowed me to take that outfit to work for show-and-tell. The shop crew was all White, so we were able to view, wear and joke about the unusual antique without hurting the feelings of any partially evolved but legally equal co-workers. </p>

		<p>To be honest, every time I see a young Bantu lad sauntering along with the exaggerated walk and having the hood of his jacket over his head I do pay close attention.</p>
<p>Especially on those hot days at noon time when the lad has the hood up and up over his head. Sometimes it is even hard to tell it is a young Bantu lad.</p>
<p>Can I too get something for this? And from whom?</p>
<p>See, the woman had a reasonable fear. See?</p>

		<p>Is it even remotely possible that the offending individual was wearing what was supposed to be a dunce cap? Conical dunce caps were regularly featured in cartoons and other popular communications when I was a kid and if the offender is middle aged,he might have remembered them too.</p>

Why do black folk believe we would want to work with or befriend people who have no sense of humor?</p>
<p>Frankly, I have no intention of befriending blacks. Knowing that one perceived inappropriate comment, act, gesture, joke, or mis-heard word could cost me money or my freedom isn&rsquo;t worth the risk.<br>

No blacks, no problems.<br>

		<p>Company parties in general should be minimized. Work should be for the purpose of making money. Except for gvt work which in general, although I am fond of national parks and the Postal service, should not exist. A company party should be by definition boring. Or there is something wrong with the company. You want fun? Have a party in your own house or go to a bar where the people look and think like you.</p>

		<p>It never fails to amaze me how many people buy into the &#8216;dress casual, we&rsquo;re nice people, reeeeally!&rsquo; attitude of their employers on any whackadoodle event, rather than CYA&rsquo;ing all the more judiciously in protection against backbiting from their fellow salary slaves.</p>
<p>After all, you are there to work.  Not to pretend to be one big happy multicult.</p>
<p>Having said that, I have a hard time seeing a Jew &#8216;reduced to tears&rsquo; at the sight of Adolph Hitler or an SS Uniform at an office Halloween Party.</p>
<p>Generally because they are expected to know the difference between reality and make believe and could never sell the &#8216;panic attack&rsquo; reaction to something neither they nor their parents nor (increasingly) their grandparents had ever seen.</p>
<p>Maybe if we sent blacks back to being janitors for a few more decades, they would mature and be ready for the big bad nasty world of office work.</p>
<p>By then the government ought to be completely broke and all the Lawyers safely resting at the bottom of the sea too.</p>

		<p>Will the pandering to brown people never cease? We need more people in positions of authority to grow a pair and tell these fools looking for a ghetto lottery win NO! If enough corporations take a stand against such blatant shakedowns this kind of nonsense would greatly diminish or stop altogether. The amount of cowardly managers and other authority figures afraid of being labeled racist is just mind-boggling. Where&rsquo;s their self respect? Where&rsquo;s their courage?</p>

		<p>She had better not visit  Spain then during &#8220;Semana Santa&#8221; - Saints&rsquo; week/Easter week, when the big religious processions take place all over Spain and penitents wear tall hooded garments.  But I think that Anon &amp; Eric are correct.  Such &#8220;victims&#8221; must have night school for such people to research/teach ways to become rich overnight.  But until the Courts laugh off such claims they will continue.</p>

`I think what he was wearing is called a hoodie and almost everyone including myself has one. It is great at keeping the head warm and hiding faces during a hold up. Just watch some of the crime shows.</p>

		<p>What if a white woman claimed that she was traumatized by an employee showing up in blackface?  Certainly, her claim would be far more legitimate, given the huge black violent crime rate in the US.</p>

		<p>A quick google of Alvertis Simmons will shed some light on what this was all about, he is a black lawyer &#8220;ambuhlants&#8221; chaser of sorts, any minor complaint of racism becomes front page news when he gets involved, no matter how frivolous.</p>

<p>I remember reading a story not long ago that Prince Harry was in the costume you described and was he ever castigated and made to apologize. There have been other incidents such as this that ended the same way.  WE are not allowed to offend ANY minority, period, Jews included.</p>

		<p>Since you mentioned it, Anonymous, I wore my battle-reenactment uniform (yes, Waffen SS) to a Halloween party this year.  My wife went as a French maid.</p>
<p>Some folks looked shocked, but nobody complained; the group was mature enough to know she&rsquo;s not a French maid and I&rsquo;m not a nutzi.  It seems maturity is a scarce commodity anymore.</p>
