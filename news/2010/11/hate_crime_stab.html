			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New York Post, November 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The estate of an Ecuadorean immigrant filed a $40 million civil rights lawsuit Monday that blames police inaction over prior violence for the man&rsquo;s stabbing death during a confrontation with a mob of teens who had made a sport of targeting Hispanics.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn against county and municipal governments and numerous officials who work for them.</p>
<p>Marcelo Lucero, a 37-year-old dry cleaning worker, was walking with a friend near the Patchogue Long Island Rail Road station around midnight in November 2008 when a group of seven teenagers confronted them. During the ensuing brawl, Lucero and his friend were peppered with ethnic slurs and one of the teens fatally stabbed Lucero in the chest.</p>
<p>The killing focused attention on Suffolk County, which has seen an influx of immigrants from Central and South America in the past decade, and prompted a U.S. Justice Department investigation into the way police respond to bias attacks in the community. {snip}</p>
<p>The seven teens were convicted of hate crime-related charges. The teen who actually stabbed Lucero was convicted of manslaughter and was given a 25-year sentence; the others are serving lesser sentences. Most of the seven also admitted participating in prior attacks on Hispanics, including two earlier on the day Lucero was killed.</p>
<p>Fernando Mateo, leader of Hispanics Across America and a spokesman for the Lucero family, said police and political inaction contributed to an atmosphere where the teens felt they could attack immigrants with impunity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Advocates also have claimed harsh anti-immigration rhetoric by Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy and others created an inflammatory climate.</p>

<p><i>Advocates also have claimed harsh anti-immigration rhetoric by Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy and others created an inflammatory climate.  &ldquo;When the leaders are engaging in hate language, what do you expect impressionable teenagers to do?&rdquo; asked Kevin Faga, the attorney for Lucero&rsquo;s estate.</i></p>
<p>The average teenager can&rsquo;t identify his county&rsquo;s executive or supervisor.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The average teenager can&rsquo;t identify his county&rsquo;s executive or supervisor&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they have attorneys and the average black or hispanic teen ager usually cannot identify their fathers.</p>

		<p>&#8220;police inaction over prior violence&#8221; </p>
<p>And if the police had acted in earlier violent incidences, they would have have been accused of hate crimes, racism and  racial profiling.</p>

		<p>This is another minority shakedown. </p>
<p>Not mentioned in the article: was the hispanic a legal or illegal immigrant? What was the race of the perpetrators? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;re black. That&rsquo;s why the mestizo&rsquo;s lawyer had to reach all the way up to the Suffolk County Executive to find a white perpetrator. Without a white perpetrator there can&rsquo;t be a hate crime.</p>
<p>Official policy of the Obama/Holder Justice Dept. is whites can&rsquo;t be victims of hate crimes. They can only be perpetrators. That&rsquo;s the unofficial definition of a hate crime: any white-on-minority crime.</p>
<p>This will win just to set a precedent that anytime a minority is a victim of a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; there&rsquo;s gonna be a $40 million (or more) lawsuit and somehow somewhere a white perpetrator must be found. If the victim is white there can&rsquo;t be a lawsuit because there&rsquo;s no &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear where this is going.    </p>

		<p>As I recall the story, the attackers were of various races: white, latino Dominican, mixed.  It was the white kid who got the book thrown at him for hate crimes.  The others have done much better in the courts than him.</p>
<p>It was wrong of these young men to attack a guy for nothing.  Hey, we complain when non-whites do that to us.  It was a tragic action and I don&rsquo;t know what it is with our youth these days, of all races.  They have poor judgement and more prone to random attacks than ever before.  </p>
<p>We all expect that from poor blacks and gangbangers, but now white kids all over America are doing &#8220;beat downs&#8221; &#8220;jumping&#8221; others - even girls are becoming wild and fighting all the time.  I&rsquo;ve seen a lot more of that lately.  The average white kid out here where I live (a mostly non-white city) acts like they&rsquo;re black.  It is so sad.  Sometimes I am just speechless.</p>
<p>I blame the influence of black culture as expressed in the hip hop/gangsta rap lifestyle that is promoted in EVERY teenager show, song and event out there.  Couple that with a decline in family values among whites and you have a real crisis for the survival of our civilization that is just as serious as being swamped by third worlders.</p>

		<p>Jay #6: Let&rsquo;s put it this way: If the Illegal Alien was not in our Country, he would still be alive. </p>
<p>Just recently an Illegal Alien struck and killed an elderly White couple. The Illegal was drunk. Big surprise. </p>
<p>But, no high profile statements on the part of the DA, and the other Headline grabbers. They were just old, and White, so who cares, right? </p>
<p>If we had a dime for every Black and Brown &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; committed on White people, we could pay off the National debt. </p>
<p>Even though the group that attacked the Illegal was a mixed Race group, only the White Teen was treated harshly. So much for Equal Justice Under Law. What a bad joke we have become. </p>
<p>As far as White Teens acting Black, we have MTV, and the Movies to thank for that. </p>
<p>My kids have never seen MTV, or any anti-White hate filled Movie, either. They are quite familiar with Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s work, and Alan Ladd, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Gary Cooper, Chuck Connors, among so many others that were my favorites. </p>
<p>White kids need to be asked directly, &#8220;Why are you acting Ghetto, idiot?&#8221; Say it in a demanding tone, and look right at them in the eyes, and then watch them turn away. </p>
<p>They want to fit in, like the kids did in the time of &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;. The problem is they are not getting any positive direction, or a constructive group to fit in to. </p>
<p>AmRen needs to step up and fill this gap. It&rsquo;s not going to be just Boy Scouts, and Baseball Teams. We need to have these kids become Racially aware, and proud of themselves, and their families. Then you will see young people with pride, holding their heads up high, and defying the trash that is thrown their way.</p>
