<h1>National Unity Day Marked With Nationalist Marches</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>RT (Russia), November 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Several nationalist marches have been held across the country as Russia is celebrating the Day of National Unity.</p>
<p>In Moscow, authorities gave permission to several nationalist groups, including the &#8220;Movement against Illegal Immigration&#8221; (DPNI) and &#8220;Slavic Force&#8221;, to stage a rally of up to 5,500 people.</p>
<p>Chanting &#8220;Russia is for Russians, Moscow is for Muscovites&#8221;, the activists  &mdash;  mainly youngsters  &mdash;  marched from Lyublino to Maryuno subway stations on the capital&rsquo;s outskirts. They were holding flags with nationalist symbols and slogans demanding that immigrants be sent back to their countries.</p>
<p>According to Interfax news agency, several people were detained after a scuffle during the rally.</p>
<p>Similar nationalist gatherings have been staged in other Russian cities including St Petersburg and Novosibirsk.</p>
<p>In recent years Russia has seen a huge increase in immigration with thousands of migrant workers from former Soviet republics  &mdash;  mainly Central Asia  &mdash;  coming to the country to seek better life conditions or simply to earn money to support their families. Many Russians are not too happy about that and want the government to address the issue and come up with a balanced policy on immigrants.</p>
<p>However, allowing nationalists to stage their rallies causes concern among human rights activists, especially since xenophobic crimes are on the rise in Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is necessary to guarantee freedom of expression to people, but I do not think that such actions can bring any benefits,&#8221; the head of the Federal Migration Service, Konstantin Romodanovsky, told Interfax. &#8220;What ideas are they expressing? What are they protesting against? Against the grandchildren of those who defeated the Nazis? What is good about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pro-Kremlin youth movement &#8220;Nashi&#8221; (Ours) along with the &#8220;Stal&#8221; (Steel) and &#8220;Our Homes&#8221; staged a 20,000-strong rally  &mdash;  the so-called &#8220;Russian March&#8221;  &mdash;  in the capital&rsquo;s center. The activists were waving placards reading &#8220;Russia&rsquo;s Pride&#8221; and portraits of the WWII veterans. Another group was marching through Moscow with portraits of those they consider to be the country&rsquo;s &#8220;shame&#8221;  &mdash;  drug dealers, illegal casinos owners, and people who have sold alcohol to minors.</p>
<p>The activists also appealed to the new Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, suggesting he enlist their help in making the capital better.</p>
<p>After the rally, the youngsters split into small teams in order to film video clips on places that sell expired products and other cases of violation of the law in the capital. The results of the investigation will be passed to the Moscow government and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Russian March is a march in support of Russia,&#8221; Nashi leader, Maria Kislitsyna said earlier, as cited by the movement&rsquo;s official website. &#8220;Tens of thousands of young people have united to make their contribution to forming an attractive image of the capital. It is our country and we will live here. Therefore, we are going to fight against the disregard of law which we witness almost every day,&#8221; she stated.</p>
<p>One of the newest public holidays in modern Russia, the Day of National Unity, was introduced by then-president Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s decree in 2004 and has been celebrated on November 4 since 2005. It replaced the main holiday of the Soviet-era, the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, which was celebrated on November 7.</p>
<p>The roots of the holiday date back to the 17th Century. In November 1612 (October in the Julian Calendar) a Russian volunteers corps led by Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky managed to expel the Polish-Lithuanian occupation force from Moscow, which also led to the end of the Time of Troubles and foreign intervention in Russia in the Polish-Muscovite War (1605  &mdash;  1618). In that rather harsh period of the country&rsquo;s history, there was no tsar to guide the people. However, the entire population, no matter which social class, nationality or religious group they belonged to, united for the sake of the statehood future and pushed the aggressors out of the country.</p>
<p>In 1649, Russian Tsar Alexey Mikhailovich Romanov declared November 4 (October 22) a public holiday, which was celebrated until the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917.</p>
<p>The revived holiday, though, has not become popular with the majority of the population. While people quite enjoy having an extra day off, many still have no idea of what actually is being celebrated. According to a poll carried out by Russia&rsquo;s Public Opinion Research Centre, VCIOM, only ten per cent of the population are aware that November 4 is the Day of National Unity and can explain why it is celebrated. Only one per cent of those questioned consider this holiday important.<br>

		<p>If you look at the comments on the RT site, a user named &#8220;Russian&#8221; posts a link to the youtube video of the march. There were zero swastikas. The media keeps trying to portray us as racists, but were not. Russia for the Russians! Vladimir Putin and Medvedev are heroes!</p>

		<p>I get infuriated every time I see the word &#8220;human rights&#8221; associated with such demonstrations in European nations. It seems to me that it&rsquo;s the &#8220;human rights&#8221; of people who been responsible citizens of the country that are being violated by unwanted, socially deviant immigrants with a total disregard for law. Human rights are not civil rights, and any nation without a constitution like that of the US owes nothing to non-citizens, and as sovereign nations, they should be free to exercise civil policy without criticism.  </p>

		<p>If White Americans keep playing their cards right, the scenes described in this article may well play out in Washington, New York &amp; LA in 10 years. America &amp; Russia were allies when America&rsquo;s policy was Isolationism &amp; Segregation, in fact Alaska was sold to the Americans for a fair price.</p>

		<p>You gotta love the Russian YOUTH.  They are way ahead of American youth in race consciousness and national pride.  American youth, as a voting bloc, are almost as lock step for multi-cult, welfare statist, minority advantaged mindset as American blacks, and too often not only champion their causes, but mingle their blood with them through fornication and marriage.  One of the reasons Government pushes for every kid to go to college is so that they can be further indoctrinated for another four years.<br>
Call it Socialist/Marxist finishing school.<br>

Even in a good article, that could have ended upbeat, and pro-patria, this sort of thing smacks of yellow journalism, or at best, Pravda-style journalism.</p>
<p>As this holiday has not been part of the Russian national consciousness, OF COURSE it&rsquo;s going to take time to take root. I doubt may Tenneseeans understood why we first celebrated July 4th, back in 1790, either. Patriotism takes time, precisely because it is racial, religious, and ORGANIC.</p>

		<p>1.  It&rsquo;s A Safety Valve.<br>
Used by Putin&rsquo;s crew to monitor and catalogue the malcontents while providing a false-front of old-Slavic solidarity on &#8216;the yellow brick road&rsquo; (paved in urine) of universalist globalism.  At any price.  Including wholesale replacement of populations.</p>
<p>2.  WWII Doesn&rsquo;t Count.<br>
The Nazis defeated the &#8216;Russians&rsquo; within the first four months of the war, on the way to the gates of Moscow.  The last major fight was in October at the Pinsk Marshes outside Kiev which resulted in a headlong flight by a shattered Red Army which could bolster no more than 90,000 men for the defense of the capital.  They fought brave holding actions at Vyazma and Mozhaysk but they were doomed.  Until a &#8216;negotiated truce&rsquo; allowed 30 divisions and 1,000 tanks and planes to be redirected from the Far Eastern TVDs (Theater Of Operations) in under a month.  The resulting 600,000 men turned the tide completely because &#8216;someone&rsquo; knew that dragging the Germans around the vast Russian countryside while surging reinforcements only to protect the COGs where Hitler foolishly forced the issue would let them use the &#8216;Siberian&rsquo; troops as blood-sponges to aborb every attack.  With more recent, accurate, admissions of Russian losses approaching _40 million_, not 20, we now know who won the second world war.  It was not the Caucasian Rus who at the beginning of the campaign had no more than about 17 million total, living, souls, west of the Urals.  It was the expenditure of the remnants of the Czarist slave populations in the East that the Germans faced, again and again and again.  Indeed, the basis for the Russian -industrial- recovery came much earlier, in the period 1923-33 when so many Kulaks were forcibly translocated to &#8216;labour colonies&rsquo; which provided the basis of a factory population, almost as if by plan&hellip;</p>
<p>3.  Economics is like a car with a bad transmission trying to haul a load, uphill.  Getting that car into gear as a function of generating productivity with a population that has suffered near continual (brain drain) negative growth since the 1950s, thanks to famines and demographic misbalances between the genders in a monogamous population as much the actual losses of WWII, is well nigh impossible.  Stuck in &#8216;high gear&rsquo;, they are just smart enough to exploit what is there and just selfish enough to fear the risk of trying to build something more.  Instead, if you can import the greatest number of (dumb, arab and asian) peoples for the simple pleasures of four walls and a cook stove that doesn&rsquo;t run on dung, you can use mass effect to turn the wheel an inch at a time in low gear.<br>
If 1 million buy a car you are not generating economic motion.  If 100 million buy a loaf of bread, that car is gonna move uphill, albeit slowly but with increasing (junk consumerism = short periodism) acceleration.<br>
The hype as the hope being that you can afford to get the higher gears &#8216;repaired&rsquo; (industrial productivity to go with high consumer good base turnover to pay for endless loans for material goods import) so that you can drive on a level economic ground once you reach a given speed.<br>
It never works.  Inevitably, you hit an population load density vs. social progressiveness entropy factor from which continued advancement up the scale doesn&rsquo;t happen because there simply isn&rsquo;t enough collective higher IQ level leadership percentages within the population (which has &#8216;rewarded itself&rsquo;, genetically, using different survival metrics) to change gears and form a new class system within the remnants of the old.  While the old remains all too willing to exploit the new in denying them betterment options through (bank loan) wealth isolation, taxes and &#8216;government services&rsquo;.  Trapped, the little people form hostile exogroups with a huge population but no incentive to sustain growth.  Which is why nationalism works and socialist globalism does not.  Because the latter is by-for-and-of a given gene line&rsquo;s benefit, rewarding intelligence immediately with limited effects (by the wealthy) against it.</p>
<p>It is the mediocritous burying the meritorious, by sheer numbers.</p>
<p>Because the wealthy can&rsquo;t see what importing their own race&rsquo;s replacements does to break down social bonds by which society exists to begin with.</p>

		<p>When the Soviet Union dissolved, many republics chose to leave. Those who support ethnic based republics can&rsquo;t disagree with the concept. Sometimes it is practical for two or more ethnic groups to share a sovereign nation, but compatibility on mutuality is necessary. These immigrants come from Central Asia or the Caucasus. They were Soviet citizens. But now Russia is sovereign. Perhaps some day the republics will re-unite. Until they do,  or if they do,it is absurd to claim that Russia for Russians is racist or hostile to those who used to be Soviet citizens who now want to reside in Russia.</p>
<p> Armenia is for Armenians, Lithuania for Lithuanians, Uzbekistan for Uzbecks. Russia for Russians.  </p>
<p>All of these statements are logical and legal.</p>

		<p>This warms my heart, too!  Russians are the most pro-white people I&rsquo;ve ever met.  I hope whites the world over will start to think this way soon.  I can tell we are more and more.  Yes, we still have a lot of work to do and enemies who don&rsquo;t want us to reclaim our race and countries, but we can do it.</p>
