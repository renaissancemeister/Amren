			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aislinn Laing, London Telegraph, November 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Winnie&#8221; is due for release next year and stars American actress Jennifer Hudson in the lead role. It tells the story of struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela&rsquo;s journey from rural childhood to Johannesburg social worker to wife of one of the world&rsquo;s most famous men.</p>
<p>Directed by South African Darrell Roodt and based on Anna Marie du Preez Bezdrob&rsquo;s biography &#8220;Winnie Mandela: A Life&#8221;, it first made the headlines when Mrs Madikizela-Mandela threatened to sue unless she was allowed to see the script.</p>
<p>There were fears that the film would boost the negative image of the woman who once notoriously declared that &#8220;with our boxes of matches and our necklaces, we shall liberate this country&#8221;  &mdash;  a reference to the placing of fuel-filled tyres around the necks of suspected apartheid informers.</p>
<p>Under apartheid, she was convicted of kidnapping a 14-year-old boy who was later found beaten to death in Soweto, and she later stood trial for multiple counts of fraud.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr Roodt opted to make the &#8220;ultimate women&rsquo;s movie&#8221; portraying Mrs Madikizela-Mandela as just as deserving of the praise heaped on her former husband, played by US actor Terrence Howard, for liberating South Africa from repressive white rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;What he did was extraordinary, of course, but what she did was equally as extraordinary, if not more,&#8221; Mr Roodt said when details of the film were first revealed at this year&rsquo;s Cannes Film Festival in May.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he spent a long period in jail but she kept the struggle alive and was in the firing line. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Winnie Mandela, South Africa might have ended in ruin and chaos. It is, for me, the great untold story about South Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>South African actors including John Kani have protested about the film&rsquo;s lack of local stars, and those commenting on the leaked clip have criticised the accents of the Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accents are terrible and the makeup is questionable. When we see the real Winnie speak, with all that passion and even at 70 she is mesmerising, and she is both dangerous and beautiful  &mdash;  you can&rsquo;t help but love her,&#8221; wrote one, named Luso, on a local paper website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Jennifer, you&rsquo;re not Winnie, and we can see that from just a trailer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trailer was reportedly stolen by computer hackers from the website of the film&rsquo;s sales representative, Filmbridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;The material was not formally edited, graded or sound-mixed. At this stage, the producers have elected to make no further comment and are investigating the matter,&#8221; an insider told South Africa&rsquo;s Times newspaper.<br>

		<p>&#8220;If it wasn&rsquo;t for Winnie Mandela, South Africa might have ended in ruin and chaos.&#8221;</p>
<p> If it weren&rsquo;t for the resourcefulness, hard work, vision, courage and determination of white people, there would be no South Africa.  All the Mandelas have done is to feed off what was created by others, spread the wealth (which was quickly dissipated, without being increased) and brought a once thriving economy and nation to ruin.</p>

		<p>Winnie Mandela at a political rally sang, &#8220;Kill the Boers.&#8221;  This can be seen on a PBS program about her.)  She was involved in the kidnapping of a 14-year-old Black, and handed to Winnie&rsquo;s football team (her thugs), and then he was killed.  She got off at the trial, but some were afraid to testify against her.  (NPR carried reports of the trial as it occurred, and the results were hards edifying to the Left.)  This article quotes one as saying she is dangerous.  On that, I can agree.  She is a murderous woman who seeks to exterminate whites.  If you like Farrakhan and the New Black Panther Party, you should love Winnie Mandela.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -Hugh Murray</p>

		<p>Blacks and Liberals just love that &#8220;passion&#8221;..like the children they are they are addicted to emotion. All this vicious black<br>
bitch has to do is start screaming about &#8220;freedom&#8221; and &#8220;we shall overcome&#8221; and the blacks are mesmerized..just like they are hypnotized by the mindless thump of rap, the flash of bling bling<br>
and the bouncing of a orange basketball.</p>

<p>Is this piece taken from The Onion? I&rsquo;ve never been to South Africa, but from what I understand and read, the place is a hell hole: crime, Aids, incompetence, lawlessness, etc. Indeed ruin and chaos seem to be the order of the day, and the people can thank the post-apartheid government and people like Winnie Mandela for all her contributions. </p>

<p>Every new movie needs its promotional giveaways and trinkets with the logo of the movie on them, to give to the press, etc. For this Winnie Mandela biography, may I suggest the film&rsquo;s distributor give out little rubber-tire necklaces? With the &#8220;Winnie&#8221; logo printed along the tire&rsquo;s whitewalls, maybe? </p>
<p>Just a thought. </p>
<p>Also, something else I&rsquo;m curious about with this movie: Will the theme song be &#8220;Come On Baby Light My Tire&#8221;?</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s a murderer, a criminal and a racist first, last and always.  That the fool who wrote the above story doesn&rsquo;t see that is absolutely amazing.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that nobody mentioned the &#8220;necklacing&#8221;  in the subtitle.  In case you don&rsquo;t know, or have forgotten, what necklacing is, let me explain it to you.  An old, used tire is put over the head of the victim resting on his/her shoulders.  It is then doused in gasoline and lit, while the thugs dance and laugh and sing watching the victim scream in torment until his lungs cease due to acrid, toxic smoke and fire being drawn in.  Not to mention the agony melting, burning rubber must inflict.  This woman and her kind used this as a weapon and punishment for those who opposed her, worked willingly for Whitey, or otherwise didn&rsquo;t give enough toward the &#8220;revolution for freedom&#8221;.  And they made a movie of her?  Well, I guess I am not surprised at the depravity and utter anti-social bent of the liberals, Hollyweird, and media.  They are quite adept at putting history down the memory hole while applauding the very dregs of humanity and memorializing them in film.</p>

		<p>If extrajudicial murders are &#8220;liberating&#8221;, I imagine Algeria must be an absolute paradise, given the no-hold-barred civil war between Islamic fundamentalists and government death squads they are having there.</p>

		<p>Nelson was in prison for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Do our little, white, liberals ever ask why?</p>
<p>As I have it, he was a bomb maker.  He had others place the bombs in population centers, knowing in advance that he would be killing people.  White people&hellip;black people&hellip;he didn&rsquo;t care.  As most all leftists, he didn&rsquo;t like people.</p>
<p>My question is simple.  Did Winnie help Nelson make any bombs?</p>

		<p>A FAVORABLE biopic about serial child murderer Winnie Mandela?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?? a biopic glorifying Jeffrey Dahmer??</p>
<p>Hitler??</p>
<p>Jack the Ripper??</p>
<p>Charles Manson??<br>
 <br>
Pol Pot??</p>
<p>By these demented criteria, all are great &#8220;liberators.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is needed here is a BOYCOTT &amp; a concerted internet and media campaign to discredit this film and its psychopathic anti-heroine.</p>
