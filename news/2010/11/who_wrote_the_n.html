			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meredith Jessup, The Blaze, October 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two weeks before a potentially game-changing midterm election, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has given its endorsement to a report labeling the tea party as a self-preserving movement of racist bigots. It&rsquo;s no wonder given the fact that NAACP&rsquo;s political agenda conflicts with the vast majority of the tea party platform of smaller government and reduced spending.</p>
<p>With Wednesday&rsquo;s release of the report, however, the news media is once again dropping the ball, not only by not pointing out the NAACP&rsquo;s obvious conflict of interest with the tea party movement, but in failing to do their due diligence in reporting on where the report comes from and why it was written.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reports that the NAACP-endorsed &#8220;Tea Party Nationalism&#8221; was &#8220;put together&#8221; by the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, but doesn&rsquo;t report further on who the IREHR is. Politico reports that the NAACP &#8220;commissioned Leonard Zeskind and Devin Burghart&#8221; to write the study, but makes no mention of who Zeskind or Burghart are other than noting their association with the Institute.</p>
<p>The IREHR is a group with &#8220;long-held dreams for social and economic justice,&#8221; who condemn the &#8220;so-called Christian right, paleo-conservatism, and other far-right movements&#8221; for their &#8220;symbiotic relationship[s] with nativism and white nationalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But who are Zeskind and Burghart, the two authors the NAACP &#8220;commissioned&#8221; to write the report? The New York Times reports that Zeskind, a lifetime member of the NAACP, has &#8220;written extensively on white nationalism,&#8221; a serious understatement. Zeskind&rsquo;s career has revolved around an obsession of the &#8220;abyss of mayhem and murder&#8221; America faces at the hands of &#8220;white nationalists.&#8221; He has worked to establish himself as an &#8220;expert on extremist groups&#8221; various media outlets routinely rely on for comment, but few have bothered to expose his own extremist past.</p>
<p>Laird Wilcox, a civil rights activists who is known for examining extremists on the right and left ends of the political spectrum, has previously had Zeskind on his radar. Like many notable modern liberals, Zeskind reportedly got his start working with the Sojourner Truth Organization (STO) where his primary role was motivating the working classes &#8220;to make a revolution.&#8221; The STO&rsquo;s role model: Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, whose &#8220;iron discipline&#8221; the STO idolized.</p>
<p>In a 1978 article he wrote for the group&rsquo;s journal, Urgent Tasks, named after V.I. Lenin. Zeskind wrote about &#8220;Workplace Struggles in Kansas City&#8221; and discussed the value of a grassroots &#8220;school of communism&#8221; that would &#8220;destroy the marketplace, not sell at it.&#8221; In a 1980 article for the same publication, Zeskind denounced the American military &#8220;as a tool of U.S. Imperialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to reports, Zeskind spent the 1980s as a member of one pro-Stalinist group who worked to provoke the Ku Klux Klan and stir up racial tensions between blacks and whites. In 1986, this National Anti-Klan Network changed its name to a more benevolent-sounding Center for Democratic Renewal. In 1989, with Soviet communism on the way out, Zeskind told the Jewish Chronicle that he was &#8220;never the kind of Marxist-Leninist that they think of&#8221; and claimed his Stalinist ideology was no longer a &#8220;defining feature of my politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, the CDR and other leftist groups were busy re-branding themselves as well. According to Wilcox, rather than present socialism or Marxism-Leninism as their goal at the time, they chose to change tactics and &#8220;piggy-back it onto anti-racism which is far more popular.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, Zeskind&rsquo;s co-author, Burghart, expanded his work studying &#8220;white nationalism&#8221; to include condemning anti-illegal immigration groups like the Minutemen on the country&rsquo;s southern border, claiming the group was not patrolling the border to enforce American immigration laws, but only to prevent non-whites from entering. According to Burghart, the Minutemen represented &#8220;Klan-style&#8221; border patrol.</p>
<p>While working for the Center for New Community, Burghart participated in programs of the Center for Democratic Values, the think-tank arm of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the summer, Zeskind and Burghart turned their focus toward the tea party. On July 11, Zeskind delivered a presentation to the NAACP&rsquo;s National Convention specifically addressing the &#8220;dire threat&#8221; of the tea party {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The IREHR also convened a July meeting in London during which, as Burghart notes, the growing momentum of the tea party was discussed on an international scale {snip}:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An old Stalinist standby for undermining opposition is &#8220;ritual defamation,&#8221; as Wilcox has noted, &#8220;to call people names in the hope of defaming, discrediting, stigmatizing or neutralizing them.&#8221; From decrypted Venona files, we now know that the KGB routinely used race to divide people and British author Mark Shields has observed how the Soviets hoped &#8220;to weaken internal cohesion of the United States and undermine its international reputation by inciting race hatred.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP and the report&rsquo;s authors clearly have a stake in undermining the growing influence of the tea party and it&rsquo;s hardly coincidental that the report has been unveiled just two weeks from election day.</p>

		<p>Near the end and after the break-up of the Soviet Union many of them became &#8216;Anarchists&rsquo; and not only just anti-racists. The anarchists share some of the same goals as the Libertarians in the tea party, but I doubt they will every become good friends. Personally, while I can sympathize with the tea party and allie with them, I prefer the idea of a strong federal government.  </p>

		<p>Racist is simply an incendiary term that has lost its sting, and has even become counter productive; calling the people who stand for constitutional values too white, too male, too racist has backfired. Tea Parties are forming all over the country and we are incited by the monikers of racist, bigots, and haters. The Tea Party is an ideology that strictly constitutional based; we will not show favoritism to any group, party, or organization that refuses to adhere to the Constitution United States and the Bill of Rights it&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>The Tea Party has been castigated by the media as too white, too male, to racist. This divisive tactic has come back to bite the mass media, and other groups who seek to control and circumvent the aim of preserving the values, rights, and practices of the American people.<br>

		<p>It is becoming quite clear that selling &#8216;human rights&rsquo; and &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; is the snake oil of the age.</p>
<p>A segment of people who otherwise have no productive role in society live on grants, tax-free charity status, speaking engagements, commissioned reports and tabloid articles, all because they attach the magic, legitimizing words &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; and &#8216;rights&rsquo; to their song and dance.</p>

		<p>The NAACP is a self-preserving movement of racist bigots, who have to hire out anything that requires brain work to radical leftist honkies who are self-hating whites.</p>
<p>The NAACP; the SPLC; the ADL, all are politically driven organizations that promote certain politicians and agendas, while opposing those who are conservative.  </p>
<p>And a large part of what they are involved with is forbidden under their status as tax-exempt, non-profit organizations.  Anymore they don&rsquo;t even try to hide their violations.</p>
<p>Consequently, they need to have their tax exemptions declared null and void.</p>
<p>That they are still able to operate tax free is one of the biggest disgraces in the country today.</p>
<p>Congress MUST investigate the IRS and determine who is responsible for aiding and abetting what amounts to a crime of major proportions.</p>

		<p>Liberals are usually the most racist  &mdash;  and certainly the most race-conscious political group in existence.  They treat blacks like inferior beings who must be indulged and coddled.  No matter how outrageous a black&rsquo;s contention is, the left will never question it, just as no one bothers to argue with a toddler who tells you his teddy bear just talked.  </p>

		<p>AR exposed this geek a decade ago. See the final article listed on amren.com today:</p>
<p>&#8220;More recently, the CDR was behind the 1996 church-burning scare, which has been widely exposed as completely artificial. Writing in Commentary, former attorney for the U.S. Civil Rights Commission Michael Fumento called the alleged wave of church burnings &ldquo;a deliberate hoax&rdquo; and noted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I established that the CDR had systematically failed to count fires set by blacks in black churches, had labeled as arson a number of fires which responsible authorities insisted were attributable to other causes, and had altogether ignored fires in white churches.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Although it was exposed as a fraud, the church-burning scam was good business for the CDR. It brought in over $9 million dollars from donors in just the first month of the campaign &mdash; 27 times the CDR&rsquo;s annual operating budget &mdash; and at one point contributions were rolling in at the rate of $100,000 a day. Mr. Wilcox does not say how much of the money the CDR passed along to churches and how much it kept.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Excellent article. The racist goals of these marxists remain the same, even though their rhetoric might have changed: to destroy (white) America and white culture in general.</p>
<p>I think the best strategy is to provoke THEM. Start talking about race and white america, without inhibition, without the fear they want to instill. Call them out, force them out in the open. In the end, they are cowards.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Exactly.  And well put!  The NAACP has been used for a century as a convenient  battering ram to attack and  bring down the essentially  white Christian  character   of the USA,  by those who wish to destroy it.  This racial assault  being promoted  under the lofty titles of &#8220;Human Rights&#8221;, and &#8220;Social Justice&#8221;. I am sure that most of its gullible (black) members  haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea how they have been  used.   Blacks have provided the foot soldiers, but the organization was founded by non-blacks  and has always gotten most of its funding and direction from non-blacks. The same with this report.  But, as you say, blacks will take the fall-out when something goes wrong and backfires.  The true authors behind the curtain will evade any responsibility   and will move on to their next endeavor.</p>

<p>With notable exceptions e.g. the two White SOB/bastards who raped and murdered the mother and her two daughters, the majority of murder and mayhem comes to us cortesy of the male Black population. Nothing trumps that but it&rsquo;s interesting how much (deserved) coverage such an atrocity received whereas the equally egregious atrocities committed against Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome in Knoxville and against the five young White people in Wichita got only local coverage. The less information that Whites have about how much danger they face, the better for the agenda of the likes of Tim, George Soros,Eric Holder et al.<br>

		<p>from the article- <br>
With Soviet Communism on its way out, the Center for Democratic Renewal &#8220;and other leftist groups were busy re-branding themselves as well. According to Wilcox, rather than present socialism or Marxism-Leninism as their goal at the time, they chose to change tactics and &ldquo;piggy-back it onto anti-racism which is far more popular.&#8221; </p>
<p>I always found it interesting that while Soviet marxism was disapating in the late 1980s and early 90s, Western Europe and America suddenly became enthraled with the dogmas of polical correctness. Was this a mere coincidence or something more? Yes, the far left has been obcessed with &#8216;anti-racim&rsquo; since at least the 1960s but things really started to accelaerate in the 1990s after communism supposedly died. The term &#8216;political correctness&rsquo; dates back to the 1970s but it effects became all consuming a few decades later. As late as the mid 1980s, PC terms like &#8220;African American&#8221; &#8220;Native American&#8221; and &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; were infrequently used by most people. But after the collapese of Russian communism black people suddenly became &#8220;Afican Americans&#8221; Indians became &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; and if you were opposed to the radical elements of the gay rights movement, you were &#8220;homophobic.&#8221; And housewives, well they suddenly became &#8220;stay at home moms.&#8221; Marxism hasn&rsquo;t really disapeared, its just been rebranded and anyone is a fool to think otherwise.</p>

I wish I could agree with you.  Unfortunately, the fear of being called a &#8220;racist,&#8221; and indeed the fear of losing one&rsquo;s job if one is even suspected of &#8220;racism&#8221; inhibits a public discussion of black social pathology and the importance of genetics to the human situation.  </p>

		<p>Zeskind is a talentless carnival barker who practices &#8220;McCarthyism&#8221; (reckless, unsubstantiated charges made without regard to the truth along with guilt-by-association)in a purer form  than McCarthy ever did. In fact, when the Communists spoke of &#8220;McCarthyism&#8221; it was mostly a case of projection. Zeskind, almost predictably, was once the recipient of a $295,000 MacArthur Foundation &#8220;genius&#8221; grant. </p>

<i>One methodology of choice is that old Stalinist standby, &#8220;ritual defamation.&#8221; Says Wilcox bluntly, &#8220;The primary purpose of Watchdog organizations seems to be to call people names in the hope of defaming, discrediting, stigmatizing or neutralizing them.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>As to Zeskind, he has imagined an impending &#8220;white Christian nation&#8221; that somehow manages to accomodate both anti-statist Christians and pagan Nazi socialists. He and his acolytes have made this oxymoron work in the public mind by routinely linking what he calls &#8220;the God, guts and guns crowd&#8221; with racists and fascists.</i></p>
<p><i>This strategy has helped evoke an hysteria in Johnson County that would be laughable were it not so deeply felt. Indeed, when the Reverend Robert Meneilly made the outrageous claim that the harmless Christian conservatives of Johnson County were &#8220;a threat far greater than the old threat of communism,&#8221; he was applauded widely for his wisdom and courage. Zeskind must have been heartened. He could not have said it better himself.</i><br>

<p>Jack Cashill is a national treasure.  I own all of his books, they remain among my most prized, placed prominently, in full view, on my main bookshelf.  <i>What&rsquo;s the Matter with California</i> and <i>Hoodwinked</i> sit in honor, right next to Charles Murray&rsquo;s <i>Real Education</i>, and Harry&rsquo;s Browne&rsquo;s <i>Fail Safe Investing</i> and <i>Why Government Doesn&rsquo;t Work.</i></p>
<p>I especially recommend <i>Hoodwinked</i> to one and all.</p>
<p>Plus, M. Cashill is a Boilermaker, from Purdue, my dad&rsquo;s alma mater.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Peyolo #13: True. How many Americans heard about the beating death of 14 year old Christopher Jones, a year ago, in a suburb outside Baltimore, MD.? </p>
<p>Thanks to Section 8 Housing, a group of wild Black kids, in Christopher&rsquo;s class, caught up with him while he was riding his bicyle on his block, and beat him to death. Yet, I never hear anything about it, until it was sent to me by several friends who found it in the internet. Outrageous. </p>
<p>Also, we never saw any &#8220;Hate Crimes&#8221; charges for the wild animals that kicked a young White teenager into a coma in Jena, La. </p>
<p>But we were inundated with protest marches around the Country, and fat Rev. Al was calling for Don Imus&rsquo; firing, after he made a joke about the Rutgers&rsquo; female Basketball Team calling them &#8220;Nappy Headed Hos&#8221;. I can see why this would capture constant attention from the talking heads on Nightly News. </p>
