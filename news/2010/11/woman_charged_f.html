			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ruth Manuel-Logan, Black Voices, November 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A New Jersey model was criminally charged for running an illegal butt-boosting injection business that sent six of her female clients to the hospital with serious infections.</p>
<p>Anivia Cruz-Dilworth was indicted Tuesday for practicing medicine without a license. According to court documents, Cruz-Dilworth told the women that she was a trained professional and that she would inject them with a substance the 28-year-old called &#8220;hydro-gel,&#8221; which is supposed to enhance the buttock.</p>
<p>Instead, the New Brunswick resident injected her clients with a silicone sealant, the very same material used to caulk bathtubs. The injection sites were also sealed with Krazy Glue. Cruz-Dilworth, who has never been medically trained or educated to perform these injections, subjected the women to serious infections, ranging from cellulitis (a serious bacterial infection of the skin that spreads) to necrosis (tissue death). Several of the woman had to undergo multiple surgeries.</p>
<p>According to investigators, Cruz-Dilworth would charge her clients a discounted rate of $650 to $1,200 for a procedure that would normally range from $10,000 to $15,000. The plus-sized model would usually travel to a client&rsquo;s home, but sometimes they would come to her apartment, located in a gated community, to receive the services. {snip}</p>

		<p>Re: &#8220;Crazy Glue&#8221;. The merits of the amateur plastic surgeon not withstanding, &#8220;Crazy Glue&#8221; is a recognized alternative to sutures, especially in cosmetic surgery.  From Wikipedia (there are references):</p>
<p> Butyl cyanoacrylate has been used medically since the 1970s outside the US, but due to its potential to irritate the skin, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not approve its use as a medical adhesive until 1998 with Dermabond.[3] Research has demonstrated the use of cyanoacrylate in wound closure as being safer and more functional than traditional suturing.[4] The adhesive has demonstrated superior performance in the time required to close a wound, incidence of infection (suture canals through the skin&rsquo;s epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous fat layers introduce extra routes of contamination),[4] and final cosmetic appearance.[5][6]</p>

		<p>Actually, cyanoacrylate glue is used in surgery to close up wounds. The type used has been tested and licensed for surgery, but is the same chemical as Krazy Glue. So that&rsquo;s not the source of the problem. </p>

<p>According to noxious pop-culture mythology yes - in reality, that assertion is patently false. The mainstream-media, especially the MTV&rsquo;s and the like have been peddling this ghetto-flavored &#8220;booty&#8221; obsession for over a decade now as a means to engage in a rather transparent orgy of adoration for non-white women. While many an impressionable White teenager may embrace, or at least pay lip-service to this nonsense, I have seen no evidence whatsoever that among Whites over the drinking-age that this supposed love-affair with enormous rear-ends persists. In that sense, and fittingly so, it is a lot like rap &#8220;music.&#8221;</p>
<p>One day, providing we haven&rsquo;t wiped ourselves out by then, White women will look back at this big &#8220;booty&#8221; craze with a mixture of utter confusion and horror&hellip;and possibly a lot of snickering as well.  </p>

		<p>While laughing through the article, I did say, &#8220;I have to be fair. While what she did and her customers accepted seems idiotic and probably unsafe, is it in fact unsafe and does it work?&#8221; I know it&rsquo;s a scam, but on the other hand our society is obsessed with licensing for everything. Licensing doesn&rsquo;t slow down medical or legal malpractice, crooked accountants, or lousy teachers.Anyone dumb enough to endure the crazy glue treatment really ought not to be allowed to use our courts. </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m open minded on this important issue. What do you think?</p>

<p>Maybe for certain people but I don&rsquo;t notice any White women rushing out to get a Niecy Nash special.  I have to ask this because it just doesn&rsquo;t register in my head.  Instead of spending up to $1200 to have someone shoot bathroom caulk into your behind, why not just eat out at all the fast food joints for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next few months?  That way you can have a big thick ole booty that jiggles and gyrates like the liquid in a lava lamp.   </p>

		<p>She is an idiot. Anytime you&rsquo;re breaking the skin barrier, much less injecting some goop into a body part, it would be nice to know what you&rsquo;re doing. </p>
<p>Even if Krazy Glue is used in surgery, big deal. There are larger issues ranging from sterile technique to allergy awareness in case an individual reacts to the injection to muscle anomalies and so on.</p>
<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s a slippery slope. What&rsquo;s next - nose jobs? </p>

		<p>I have heard of this kind of medical procedure a couple of times before. In the other two cases the &#8220;doctor&#8221; was a Black transvestites who sought to enhance the boobs of other TV&rsquo;s who couldn&rsquo;t afford real implants. Both of them killed some of their patients with the same type of silicon sealant that the brainy pseudo-doctor in this article used.</p>
<p>The breast implants that doctors installed in the 1960&rsquo;s were filled with silicon. It is from that small bit of information that the problem stems. The would-be doctors hear &#8220;silicon&#8221; and they think, &#8220;I can do that!&#8221;, and off to the home improvement center they go.</p>
<p><br>
It is enterprising &#8220;doctors&#8221; such as these who keep me from joining the ranks of the compassionate, genuinely concerned social conservatives who want to shut down Planned Parenthood.  </p>

		<p>A lot of posters are picking up on the &#8220;Crazy Glue&#8221; aspect of this story. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine. Cyanoacrylate is indeed a very good bonder of human skin, as anyone who happens to have gotten some on his hands can attest. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the problem. Injecting these women&rsquo;s rear ends with silicone bathroom caulk  is the problem. </p>
<p>And while our society may be &#8220;obsessed with licensing,&#8221; I think most of us would agree that licensing of surgeons, cosmetic or otherwise, is probably a good thing.</p>

		<p>Interesting.  I spent some time googling this and found out that this is actually a common thing done in many countries, and usually not done by an actual doctor.  Many people actually travel from the US to other countries to have this dangerous and highly medically unsound procedure done.</p>
<p>Knowing that krazy glue was a commonly used medical substitute for sutures (no not actual krazy glue but the medical equivalent), I wondered if in fact, silicon sealant was used, just in a more medically oriented product.  The answer is no (at least not in the buttocks).  Instead, body fat is sucked out of one place and injected elsewhere.  The effects being temporary.</p>
<p>But many other countries, this procedure is legal, and quite common&hellip;.use of actual bathtub silicon caulk, lol&hellip;..despite all the infections and other medical problems it causes.  This doesn&rsquo;t keep customers away it seems.</p>
<p>I guess what I am trying to say is this woman likely did not scam anyone.  They actively sought her out to have a commonly done, yet highly illegal procedure, knowing full well she was not a doctor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to do such a thing, assuming safe and sound medical cosmetic surgery and then get preyed on by an unscrupulous criminal.  It is quite another to KNOW what the deal is and purposefully seek this out.</p>

		<p>I happen to like a woman with a large butt. Not every white male wants what the gay-run Hollywood says a woman is supposed to look like: an adolecent boy with breasts.<br>
Perhaps that&rsquo;s what you think a woman should look like. But not me.<br>
With that said this whole injection story is just another reporting of a scam on stupid people.</p>

		<p>Feller;  As someone who practiced for 25 years, I think licensing does slow down incompetence and malpractice.  Alternative medicine is worse than mainstream, but mostly as a money drain, whereas, invasive proceedures are always highly risky.  My head spins when I try to imagine what would be going on now if there were no regulations, education, and licensing laws.  I DO think they ought to be tightened up a great deal more.  But the worst thing going on would likely be hugely damaging drugs available without a perscription.</p>

		<p>As other stated krazy glue is fine, but injecting silicon gel from the hardware store is disasterous. The stuff isn&rsquo;t sterile and the goop cannot be easily removed (plus it moves around once in the body). I have heard this is even more common in the ghetto transexual community (filler for hips, cheekbones, etc&hellip;).</p>

<p>  I remember over a year ago hearing an impressionable, attractive young white female say to her black male and female friends that she &#8220;wished she had a butt&#8221; like a huge and grotesque black dog, of unknown breed, who could hardly walk straight because of its enormous rear end. The dog was being walked without lease by the admiring mixed group of &#8220;youths&#8221; loitering on a local street corner. </p>

		<p>Buttocks are muscles which perform the same function for the legs that shoulders do for the arms.</p>
<p>As such, they should be in proportion to the legs, or in proportion to the activity that the legs do.</p>
<p>If these women want bigger derrieres, they should take up ice-skating or ballet. Then their gluteus medius muscles would become bigger from lifting the leg in a lateral motion, and would have the pleasing appearance of muscle, not fat as is so prevalent among the questionable persons they seem to want to immitate.</p>
<p>This muscle would also be alive, vibrant, and cling to the trochanter protrusion of the femur and the pelvic girdle; it would not shrink, harden, or turn brittle and yellow like bath-tub caulk. </p>

But with the MSM, MTV and Hollyweird promoting this as desirable, then I guess you will have dumb White women falling for this ugliness. Just look at the injected huge lips that some White women love. UGLY is all I can say.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>That explains a lot.  I ended up at a famous gay club in DC watching black drag &#8220;performers&#8221; (it&rsquo;s a long story) featuring two black transsexuals with enormous amounts of facial fillers in their cheeks.  I&rsquo;m talking about grotesque deformity that looked like the old horror movie &#8220;Killer Clowns from Outer Space&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I remember thinking, &#8220;How did they get that done?  Did they leave the country for surgery?&#8221;  No US doctor would do something that extreme, and cheek implants don&rsquo;t come in that size.  It would be an automatic malpractice verdict once the jury sees it, plus a loss of license if the medical board investigated.  </p>
<p>I guess the &#8220;ladies&#8221; just got someone in the DC gay ghetto to inject something into their cheeks until their faces looked like diagonal squares.  We&rsquo;ll probably see a lot more of it once Obamacare is available to correct any back-alley surgical complications.  I wonder if tax payers will be required to cover sex-change surgery, too?  <br>

Notice how all the micro thin Hollywood actresses have had cesareans to be able to have children.

		<p>Is this story for real or just multicult garbage jinned up to make nonwhite women proud of their fat behinds?  Most people go to the plastic surgeon to have the fat sucked off a giant behind not add to it.  For that matter why do you even need to see a surgeon or a even a quack when it&rsquo;s so easy to add the pounds on.  </p>

<p>You need to go to some rural and lower income urban areas. You will find some fat fellow Whites with REAL big butts and pretty much everything else.<br>

<p>Come on David, you know exactly what I am talking about! I am talking about the PROTRUDING backsides of blacks, not &#8220;fat&#8221; people! </p>
<p>Since it is obvious that you just HAD to bring fat White people into this discussion makes one wonder just what is your real agenda here?  I have noticed this of late, a few posters here can&rsquo;t wait to put down Whitey and defend whatever the minority of the day may be.  Exactly what is your agenda? </p>

		<p>This addresses a very real difference between the White race and the Black race  &mdash;  average body shape. If you look at white women, they are wider from side to side, and thinner from front to back. Black women are exactly opposite, thicker from front to back, and narrower from side to side. This is just a biological fact in most cases. Even slender black women tend to have &#8220;bubble butts&#8221;. Of course there are exceptions to every rule, and there are always some women of every color who are so obese that you can&rsquo;t tell where they are wider. Having &#8220;junk in the trunk&#8221; is  highly desired and praised within the black culture.</p>

<p>Is it really about that or is it about making sexpots out of black women with big West African behinds? <br>
