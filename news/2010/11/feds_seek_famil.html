<h1>Feds Seek Families: Kenney</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Lilley, Timmins Press (Ontario), November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Harper government is changing the mix of immigrants it plans to admit to the country over the next year.</p>
<p>While the overall target for permanent residents will remain between 240,000 and 265,000, the government will seek to admit more children and spouses through the family class and fewer economic migrants. The annual number of economic class immigrants selected for their job skills will drop by 5,000 to 6,000 while the number of family class immigrants will go up by between 1,500 and 2,500.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canada&rsquo;s postrecession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong,&#8221; Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said in a statement. &#8220;At the same time, we are maintaining our commitment to family reunification and refugees.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2009, Canada admitted 252,179 immigrants as permanent residents plus 178,478 temporary foreign workers and 85,140 students. The annual report to Parliament states that the number of foreign workers decreased by 7% as a reaction to the recession and lower demand for foreign workers, while the number of foreign students increased by 7%.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2008, the number of foreign workers grew by 71% from 82,151 to 192,519.</p>
<p>NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow blasted the government for what she sees as an unacceptably high level of temporary foreign workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of continuing the destructive trend of bringing in 178,478 temporary workers to Canada each year, the Conservatives should allow for even more families to join their loved ones in Canada,&#8221; Chow told QMI Agency.</p>
<p>Kenney said the immigration department doesn&rsquo;t set out to bring so many foreign workers to Canada each year, but instead responds to the demands of businesses who can&rsquo;t find workers. In order to be given permission to bring in temporary foreign workers, businesses must show that they have advertised the job and cannot find Canadians who can fill the position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within five years, there will be no growth in the Canadian labour market,&#8221; Kenney said while defending the level of immigration. &#8220;You cannot pay for our pensions, our health care and all the services Canadians want with a shrinking tax base.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenney said that leaves Canadians with two options, accept higher immigration levels or have more children.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;You cannot pay for our pensions, our health care and all the services Canadians want with a shrinking tax base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our pioneering forefathers had no such luxuries.  We too could survive without resorting to Ponzi-scheme financing.</p>
<p>It is likely that social programs will suffer cuts anyway. The real reason for high immigration in Canada (and the U.S.) is to appease the wealthy who sit at the top of the pyramid scheme. </p>

		<p>I wonder if jobless Americans would be interested in going to Canada for jobs.  Seems that everyone EXCEPT white people will leave their family and go to a foreign land for grueling work.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s because we value being with family more or are smarter.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>

		<p>Canadian Immigration Minister Jason Kenney: &ldquo;Within five years, there will be no growth in the Canadian labour market.  You cannot pay for our pensions, our health care and all the services Canadians want with a shrinking tax base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor George J. Borjas is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy School of Government and among the nation&rsquo;s foremost labor economists. Except below from a 2001  interview with Peter Brimelow, editor of VDARE.COM:<br>
https://www.vdare.com/pb/071226_borjas.htm</p>
<p>BRIMELOW: What about the argument that there&rsquo;s a demographic structure problem and the Baby Boomers need immigrants to pay for their retirement?</p>
<p>BORJAS: That&rsquo;s a different issue. That problem exists because of the way that we have built our insurance system for the elderly. We have a security system that is basically a Ponzi scheme. We need more people to pay the benefits. </p>
<p>But immigration is still not a solution for two reasons: One, the kind of immigrants we get on average need government services. So even if the immigrants provide for retirement costs, we have to support their social assistance programs. </p>
<p>Two, what&rsquo;s going to happen when the immigrants retire? Do we have to let more immigrants in to pay for them too? It&rsquo;s not a viable long-run solution &hellip;</p>

		<p>Beyond resource extraction, immigration is the only thing keeping the Canadian economy alive.</p>
<p>The hum of residential construction and commercial property development from Atlantic to the Pacific is driven by mass immigration.  Free Trade agreements and global outsourcing have decimated the branch plant industries which created the post-war Canadian middle class. </p>
<p>With few exceptions, the Canadian construction industry is wholely dependant on rapid population growth. Remove immigration, and unemployment in Canada would soar.</p>
<p>It is a sad reality that Canada is a resource rich country, badly managed by recent arrivals and people who care nothing for its future. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Kenney said that leaves Canadians with two options, accept higher immigration levels or have more children.&#8221;: This is again only half of the statement. It should read something like this: &hellip;accept the easy way of higher immigration and the destruction of the our nation, or the more difficult way of halting immigration and developing policy to encourage internal population growth. Actually, no matter what the citizens want, big business, in conjunction with corrupt, treasonous politicians will drive immigration and extreme population growth at the expense of the nation. All to gain a temporary increase in wealth for the few who hold power. Everyone else will pay in terms of money, safety, and community.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Try robotics.  Try higher wages.  Try not giving into the WTO to control market values by depressing the West to raise up the ROW.</p>
<p>Ponzi Schemes based on Immigration only serve short term capitalist societal piracy.  Long term, they dispossess the nation of it&rsquo;s internal identity and the cultural ethics which -support- the social welfare state.</p>
<p>Canadians: Time to take care of your extended families again.  Time to keep a large enough percentage of your adult caregivers at home so that you can -raise- those &#8216;large families&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t trade ethnic homogeny for cheap foreign wage slaves.  Because they will breed you into the gutter and then laugh at your appeal to help support your own group over theirs.</p>
<p>These are people who are USED TO dying at 50 folks.  They only move up in their world when their parents kick it.</p>

<p>I doubt it. It works the same way in Canada as in America.</p>

<p>Of course option (3) is never given:  Stop operating public pension systems as Ponzi schemes, dependent upon an exponential growth of population forever.  Accept that people will have to pay more in and retire later.<br>

<p>Most of these immigrants are 3rd world and often end up taking more in taxes than they contribute. Why is it that Canada&rsquo;s tax base is suddenly shrinking, it&rsquo;s population was smaller 50 years ago yet it did just fine. </p>
