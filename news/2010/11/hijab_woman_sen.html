<h1>Hijab Woman Sentenced to Six Months</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Malik, ninemsn (Sydney), November 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Muslim woman has lodged an appeal after she was sentenced to six months in prison for falsely accusing a police officer of forcibly removing her veil.</p>
<p>Carnita Matthews, a 46-year-old mother of seven, broke down in tears as Magistrate Robert Rabbidge described her crime as &#8220;deliberate, malicious and ruthless&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not a shadow of doubt in my mind, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she knew that the complaint she was making was false,&#8221; he told Campbelltown Local Court on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system would collapse, of course, if people are making false and wrong complaints to authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthews was charged with one count of making a false complaint against police in August, after signing a statutory declaration claiming an officer forced her to remove her hijab, or face veil.</p>
<p>It was made three days after she was pulled over by Senior Constable Paul Fogarty at Woodbine, in Sydney&rsquo;s southwest, for a random breath test on June 7 this year.</p>
<p>A video of the incident, which was played to the court, shows Matthews accusing the officer of being a racist after he handed her a fine for not displaying green P-plates properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look at me and see me wearing this and you couldn&rsquo;t handle it. All cops are racist,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The magistrate rejected her lawyer&rsquo;s argument that the prosecution could not prove it was Matthews herself who made the complaint and signed the declaration.</p>
<p>But police prosecutor sergeant Lisa McEvoy said there was no doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her signature on that affidavit coupled with the signature on her driver&rsquo;s licence is exactly the same,&#8221; she told the court.</p>
<p>Despite the fact Matthews has no previous criminal record, the magistrate said her crime was serious and demanded a &#8220;denunciatory&#8221; sentence.</p>
<p>He said highway patrol police faced an &#8220;onerous duty&#8221; in issuing fines to irate members of the public, adding an allegation of racism was serious and could jeopardise a career.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an absolute and clear duty on police to satisfy who they are dealing with,&#8221; he told the court.</p>
<p>Stephen Hopper, Matthews&rsquo; lawyer, immediately lodged an appeal to the District Court against the conviction and sentence. His client was granted bail.</p>
<p>&#8220;The defence disagree with the learned magistrate&rsquo;s decision,&#8221; he told AAP outside the court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accordingly, we have lodged an all-grounds appeal for the matter to be heard in the District court.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Hopper said he couldn&rsquo;t comment personally on the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, that doesn&rsquo;t stop other people forming their own views,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure some people will agree with the magistrate and some people will disagree.&#8221;<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to collapse anyway from the exorbitant burden of paying for the influx of unskilled labor, not to mention the trouble, mayhem and murder caused by imams preaching hate and jihad in the mosques.</p>

		<p>Aside from the view of this woman&rsquo;s ugly face, why can&rsquo;t a govt legally view her face?  What do you have to hide? Your virtue? Sorry, your idea of virtue is our idea of perversion. </p>
<p>The veil may work in Saudi or Afghanistan. The west has every right to remove it, and imprison those who wear it.</p>
<p>What is it about the West that is not Muslim (or Orthodox Jewish), that you don&rsquo;t understand?</p>

		<p>Well finally, a judge has got it right. It&rsquo;s time to hold the race-hustlers responsible for their slanderous charges. If I were George Bush I would have sued rap idiot Kanye West for his unproven charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; that he leveled at Bush after Hurricane Katrina. It&rsquo;s time to make the race-hustlers prove their charges in a court of law.</p>

		<p>Carnita Matthews.   Is this an American black woman?  Sounds like it to me.  She&rsquo;s certainly not a Middle Easterner.</p>
<p>And mother of seven!  My, my.  Who is supporting them?</p>

The faceveil works in Afghanistan, Saudiarabia and so on simply because women there have no rights, and therefore no need to identify themselves.</p>
<p>They are not allowed to drive, and aren&rsquo;t really allowed outside of their homes without a male escort.<br>
So identifying them is not a problem, it&rsquo;s just their &#8220;guardian&#8221; who has to identify himself.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t quite work in a western society tho, drivers license and photo ID becomes kinda useless if you cannot see their face.</p>

		<p>Several Comments actually:</p>
<p>This incident took place in Southwest Sydney, sadly this is now Sydney&rsquo;s Muslim heartland thanks to waves of uninvited Muslim immigrants.</p>
<p>The name, Ms Matthews, not very Arabic, this is a traditional Anglo Christian or Surname.</p>
<p>7 Children! Only 3 more to go before she has the obligatory 10. It is possible that even here in Sydney Australia that at least one of these (heavily taxpayer subsidized) children will be groomed for Jihad. It is also very probably that the daughters will be put into forced marriages (Overseas) as soon as they reach puberty.</p>
<p>The NSW Highway Patrol is polite but efficient, no one likes being pulled over, but these people (Muslim Invaders) consistently feel they are ABOVE the law in such matters. Does their medieval code of law extend to traffic matters, I doubt it.</p>
<p>If Ms Matthews was living in a Muslim Nation it is unlikely that she would even be allowed to drive.</p>

		<p>No wanting to take off their masks to be photographed for identity purposes reminds me of the Muslim genius here in the US who told all their Muslim women to tell TSA thugs they would &#8220;pat down themselves.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How can they expect a cop to verify that the person pulled over is the person depicted on the driver&rsquo;s license with what amounts to a ski-mask for girls on her face? Did she have to remove her precious veil to get her license picture taken, or is that another arena where these intruders gain a special privilege denied to the rest of us?</p>
<p>What a joke, in summation, their argument is something along the lines that mere identification is unreasonable search? Adapt to our culture or go back to your own.</p>

<p>You miss the point.  Carnita???<br>
In America, that would raise the flag.  It would be considered most likely a &#8220;black&#8221;  name.  Just like Laqueesha or Damita.</p>
<p>And Matthews, like Jackson and Jefferson, is common in the South.  Is this a black American who has migrated to Australia?</p>

		<p>In the Old West, Outlaws used to wear neckerchiefs up around their faces when robbing a Stage Coach or Bank. That&rsquo;s what these &#8220;women&#8221; seem to be like, when they walk around with their head towel, and mask over their faces. </p>
<p>Not that they are anything to look at, going by the few that don&rsquo;t wear the face masks. Which begs the question: </p>
<p>&#8220;Why do the majority of Musim women not wear this face mask, but still wear the head scarf, while the minority insist that it is their Religion to not only wear it, but not take it off in public?&#8221; </p>
<p>Obviously, these people use their Religion as a crutch of convenience to sidestep, and get away with things, that no Western person would be allowed to get away with. I am sick of it, and I am sick of them. Send them all back to the sandbox they came from!</p>

		<p>Muslim women and Muslims in general are the most thin skinned people in the world, especially regarding womens clothing. Since they also have a built in superiority complex, nothing a non- Muslim does is right or applies to them. To give you an example- I knew a Muslim woman who was an American convert who wore Islamic dress. Her son was in counseling due to custody issues and this required a physical description of all parents and stepparents involved. Since nothing of this woman could be seen but her face and hands the counselor wrote &#8220;a woman in Islamic dress&#8221; for her description. This offended her to no end but seriously how would school authorities be able to identify her if she showed up at the school to take the kid unauthorized?</p>

		<p>First the authorities pretend to take the side of minorities. And for a couple of years, there is a lot of deferring to their culture at the expense of white people. Then, the authorities turn on them.</p>
