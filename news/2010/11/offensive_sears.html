<h1><a href="http://wvwnews.net/story.php?id=9521">Offensive Sears Ad Gone After Angry Whites Complain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Western Voices World News, November 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A small victory like this can logically lead to bigger and better ones.</p>
<p>A racially provocative Christmas commercial aired by Sears has disappeared after angry whites left negative remarks about the ad on YouTube.</p>
<p>The commercial, which featured a black man repeatedly kissing a blonde white girl under mistletoe, was broadcast on all three networks during morning news shows. The ad was posted on YouTube where it received over 15,000 views. Comments left by vistors to the YouTube site were overwhelmingly negative, and ranged between harsh to hostile. After the commercial stopped running, the YouTube version also disappeared.<br>

		<p>This advertisement made me want to vomit and I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s gone but I saw a different version of it on the TV yesterday. This time it shows White women kissing White and black men, as if that would be less offensive.  This has been a long time coming but I&rsquo;ve decided to get rid of my satellite dish.  There is so little to watch on TV anymore but when I do find something, and it&rsquo;s usually something that&rsquo;s over twenty years old, some offensive commercial like this will air between segments. I can get a service like Netflix and watch all the vintage TV I want at a fraction of the cost of paying for satellite.  </p>

		<p>the Sears ad just was just on the west coast, 3:30 pm, and i just called sears customer service, 800 549-4505, (select#5), very nice service reps, explained how disgusted and repulsed we were, and we were going to return what we had bought over the weekend</p>

Blacks should have protested the ad too.</p>
<p>Black women should have protested the loudest.</p>
<p>Black women complain there aren&rsquo;t enough eligible black men. Black women should be giving their men hell for passing them over for blonds.</p>

		<p> There&rsquo;s hope for us yet, if Whites were angry enough about that offensive ad to brow-beat Sears into taking it down.</p>
<p> I noticed a similar situation in a TV ad by one of the on-line dating services recently. The ad as originally aired showed a smiling, lascivious-appearing black man &#8220;chatting up&#8221; a blonde White woman. Just &#8220;gittin&rsquo; acquainted,&#8221; you know. The portion of that ad which showed the above scenario disappeared after a couple of days, I noticed. Hopefully it was due to other White protests.</p>
<p> The liberal diversity pushers who air ads like those are testing the waters, the same as a person would who had stolen your credit card number, then bought a few small items with it to see if his theft would be detected. If miscegenation is presented in TV ads as &#8220;normal,&#8221; then they&rsquo;ll push for it harder and harder. There&rsquo;s enough of it going on in this society already, without our giving a green light to the glamorization of it.</p>

		<p>Really surprised that an outcry of &#8220;white racists&#8221; would lead Sears to pull an ad.  There are so many of these commercials that insinuate or outright show white female/black male intimacy that it&rsquo;s hard to say one is worse than the others.  One thing to keep in mind about these ads is that nothing in them is done by accident.  If they show a wf/bm couple it&rsquo;s because they want to, it isn&rsquo;t random at all.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a giant photo on the wall in the Bedroom department <br>
of Sears&rsquo; Crystal River, Florida&rsquo;s store showing a dark skinned man and a very white woman lying together.</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s their contribution to multiculturalism, childishly thinking that their &#8220;open-mindedness&#8221; is going to bring the non-white hordes rushing to their location, even though the entire area is lily white.  Such stupidity.</p>

		<p>In 1958 an absolutely overwhelming majority of Americans, a whopping 96%, disapproved of black/white unions. It wasn&rsquo;t until the early 90s that a plurality claimed support. What was once considered a manifestly logical view held by virtually all whites -and I mean virtually all whites- is now decried as &#8216;bigotry&rsquo; &#8216;intollerance&rsquo; &#8216;ignorance&rsquo; &#8216;hate&rsquo;, etc. Apparently the unwashed masses will believe just about anything if they&rsquo;re told it over and over again, despite what their best instincts would have them believe. </p>

		<p>Is there a still from this ad posted anywhere? It sounds no more offensive than the military anti-AIDS poster reported on here a few days ago.</p>
<p>I also wonder why the MSM isn&rsquo;t all over this story? It sounds like the perfect &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; for them to lecture and hector whites about their latent and inherent &#8220;racism.&#8221; Maybe they&rsquo;re keeping quiet to avoid embarrassing Sears, a major advertiser.</p>

<p>Ummm&hellip; of course, there was me for awhile dating black women, but at least the media wasn&rsquo;t in some sort of frenzy to promote my personal choice (a bad one, it turned out) as the very definition of &#8220;normal.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The most important thing to notice about this is that every last trace of this incident has been literally scrubbed from the internet.  It&rsquo;s as if it didn&rsquo;t happen and soon will be treated as if it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>These things are not accidental.  And they aren&rsquo;t political correctness gone too far.</p>
<p>This is intentional brainwashing.  Every single channel of the TV, 24/7, both the content and the commercials, nonstop, works at this form of brainwashing.  It&rsquo;s all encompassing and is being done by a specific, identifiable group of people.  Their goals are obvious.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t time we started talking about it?</p>

		<p>Someone&rsquo;s re-posted it. It is truly..as my Grand Dad used to say.. &#8220;Vominatin&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve found that department store advertisements pedal this nonsense more than any other type of business. Target and Old Navy ads are way up there on the urrp-inducement scale as well.</p>
<p>I always loved Sears..it was the one department store where men, women and kids could all have a ball in, even if you didn&rsquo;t buy anything. It&rsquo;s long since succumbed to me-tooism. The store you could always trust has stooped to this sort of thing. Very, very sad..    </p>

		<p>That is what I have written before and you can see those commercials with nearly only negative response all over youtube.</p>
<p>What is most interesting about this is that the average youtube user is young! That means even the young whites are already awakening. The changes are getting so fast, that most of them notice it even if they are only 17 years old. They know who they have to fear if they come back home late.<br>
And if they than see on TV only commercials with black male blond girl couples, they understand it pretty sure.</p>
<p>I have seen a video in which a blond girl an a black man were kissing and one of the highest rate comments was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually I am not racist. But this video makes me racist!&#8221;</p>

		<p> And some deluded whites actually believe that there is no media campaign to promote miscegenation? This is all part of the privileged elites &#8220;great liberal dream&#8221; of the elimination of racism through miscegenation. Years ago, I actually heard the late famous Kennedy historian Arthur M.

		<p>The same corporate cowardice that responds so rapidly to black and brown squealing is now shown to be an advantage to us as well. We should press that, for despite having declining percentages of the population whites have several characteristics not available to the People of Color. We have the capacity for organized, intelligent and sustained effort once mobilized behind a governing idea, whereas the black/brown folk have had to be constantly corralled and their organization done for them by certain non-black/brown leftist zealots. This is why I am not as concerned about absolute numbers (up to a point, of course) as I am getting the message out. So who says boycotts can&rsquo;t work? </p>

		<p>These kinds of shock ads are outrageous. White fathers and mothers everywhere pray to God that their sons and daughters don&rsquo;t come home one day with a non-White because they think it&rsquo;s a cool thing to do.

		<p>Imagine a board room at an ad agency.  It is 100% fear driven I&rsquo;m certain.  The creators of these ads probably work off of charts that prescribe the &#8220;proper&#8221; amount of racial diversity which must be shown in an ad.  Anything less than the &#8220;proper&#8221; amount could be caught by the editor and jobs would be at stake.  I gaurantee they have policy that insists precribed amounts of diversity for every situation.  </p>

		<p>Thank you nooffensebut, it was your post I linked to, it seems.</p>
<p>Re: my previous post-&#8220;pedal&#8221;=&#8221;peddle&#8221;. I&rsquo;m not a complete ignoramus.</p>
<p>  As if this ad campaign wasn&rsquo;t enough, Our local Sears now features bilingual store announcements!  First in English (I&rsquo;m am SO grateful for the consideration!), then Spanglish. And they are far from infrequent. On my last, or perhaps I should say FINAL..visit to Sears, those damned things literally drove me out of the store. It was like having a &#8220;Chopsticks&#8221; played on a toy piano in your head. </p>
<p>  I&rsquo;m sure that these ads went right over the (empty)heads of urban hipster types on both coasts, but this time it seems that Sears tapped into the REAL America and got bitten. You&rsquo;d  think the CEOs of the traditional brick &amp; mortar retail stores would wise up, after being smacked so hard by Internet merchandising, and not make mad what&rsquo;s left of the folks that have never heard the term &#8220;e-commerce&#8221; &amp; only shop in real time. Too much to hope for, I guess.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black women complain there aren&rsquo;t enough eligible black men. Black women should be giving their men hell for passing them over for blonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black women know as well as anyone else, if not better, that their men are like children. They have no self control, and like children they will always reach for the brightest toy on the Christmas tree (blonde-haired White women) and they will eschew any trace of adult responsibility such as getting an education or holding a job and supporting a family. </p>
<p>That said,  my husband will NOT be getting Craftsman tools this year, and I long ago stopped buying anything else at Sears, due to other issues. </p>

<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s always a black male with a blonde white female. If it&rsquo;s really about &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; and &ldquo;fairness,&rdquo; and not about eliminating the White race, why is it always, always that combination?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extension of the &#8220;Black on Blonde&#8221; porn website that some of us have stumbled upon.  I found it years ago when I was looking for info on &#8220;white and black relations.&#8221;  That is what came up and it made me sick for days. It was part of what drove me to become an Amren poster and subscriber, along with the race realities Katrina exposed.  Online porn degrades white women, especially blondes in ways far too horrid to imagine.  Imagine that children can find it and watch!  A great deal of racial taunting goes on too. What I can&rsquo;t understand is the apparently huge amount of white women who sell-out after 40+ years of feminist criticism.  I guess it is that money talks and black pop culture is stronger than any individual&rsquo;s self esteem, especially when they are under 25 and brainwashed liberals as well.  But there does seem to be something about being female that allows corruption more readily than the male.  Even though I am a non-believer, there is something to the Adam and Eve parable.  But the online porn situation is a horrid, horrid, situation that ought to be policed and shut down firmly, especially when it is clear that a form of racial hatred is being expressed in black on white sites.  Online porn is undermining any measure of human morality, ethics, and one of the main reasons that ads like this, as well as some of what is out there on &#8220;normal&#8221; television.  The spiral always goes down, unless a concerted effort is made to combat it.<br>

		<p>Lexus has a Christmas car commercial out that is just as bad, gorgeous white woman with black man.  I wrote an email complaint to them yesterday and already got a response.  If you care about this kind of propaganda and want to put a stop to it you need to take the time to at least write emails to the companies.  They all have web customer service email addresses that you can complain to and they do respond and make record of them. It is time to stand up and be counted if you give a damn instead of just watching as the culture deteriorates around us.</p>

		<p>#1 Anonymous, You won&rsquo;t miss your Satellite Dish.  We stopped Cable years back, and finally, prompted by &#8216;The Switch to Digital&rsquo; we put our Lie Boxes (Televisions) back in their crates.  We thought we&rsquo;d get one out of the storage room to watch a DVD every now and then.  But Youtube movies are easier.</p>
<p>We thought we&rsquo;d watch news and weather on the cardio machines at the gym.  But we seldom do.  Our news comes from Amren and Vdare, plus videos from channels we subscribe to on Youtube.</p>
<p>We were tired of the incessant anti-White lies and distortions on television, and decided to make room in our lives for other information venues.</p>
<p>Even if Internet Freedom is abridged, we won&rsquo;t be going back to MSM sources.  It&rsquo;s nice being able to go for days at a time, without seeing Obama&rsquo;s face.  </p>

		<p>What is interesting about this is that Sears is a for profit company. Someone in the organization must have thought they could make money with this ad. With the economy the way it is and years of Affirmative Action for not only blacks but white females, perhaps white males don&rsquo;t have the clout they used to. Note Gubmint workers are only going to be subject to a freeze-not layoffs and if you&rsquo;ve seen gov&rsquo;t workforces you would know it is all about the diversity and not the actual results. Black females should care, and there probably is some squawking, but there is still a getting back at whitey amongst even them that prevents any rational assessment.  Heck that black lawmaker from Michigan was not looking at Black skin magazine he was looking at white women in Playboy.</p>

		<p>#41 Lauren, we did the same thing!  Our satellite receiver box broke and, while waiting for them to ship us a new one, I realized that we were better off without it.  Didn&rsquo;t hook up the digital converter, either.  We do watch DVDs from the library - much cheaper and I can monitor and guide what my daughter watches.  Recently we were at a friend&rsquo;s house and my little girl actually complained that my friend&rsquo;s children spent too much time watching TV instead of playing and having fun!  </p>
<p>Oh, and the white woman/black male propaganda in advertising isn&rsquo;t limited to adults - it seems to be everywhere in children&rsquo;s ads, as well.  I just received a catalog from a local children&rsquo;s clothing store where I shop often.  Photo on the cover of  two little, pre-teen kids - a black boy and a blue-eyed blonde girl with their arms around one another, and their heads touching, smiling.  A very intimate pose, and not one that children would naturally adopt.  And this is a store whose black clientele must be practically zero.  I have literally never seen a black customer in their stores.  It&rsquo;s just not the right demographic for their clothes.  </p>
<p>Northeast Asians shop there, Indians, etc., yet their catalogs are curiously free of Asian kids, or indeed any but white and (light-skinned, often obviously mixed-race) black kids.  They&rsquo;re holding hands, they&rsquo;re having slumber parties, the propaganda could not be more blatant.  It&rsquo;s not advertising, it&rsquo;s social engineering!           <br>

Complaining to companies that run white race mixing ads is exactly one of the things that needs to be done.<br>
At Sears.com in the customer service section with some effort you can find a place to leave your complaint or call Sears National Customer Relations at 1-800-549-4505. </p>

But, I don&rsquo;t leave negative comments on youtube or elsewhere.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll now change that strategy, if it does work.

		<p>Anon #3: A few years back, I was ill treated by Sears, and this had followed making over a $400.00 purchase from them. </p>
<p>I called the Sears Customer Service line, and explained to them what had happened, and how we were not happy with how we were treated, especially on the heels of our large purchase. </p>
<p>Well, I told the Representative that we were in the market for a new Dishwaher, but now, would not even consider Sears for that purchase. </p>
<p>Further, I told this woman that my wife and I were cutting up our Sears credit cards, and wanted confirmation that our account was closed out. This really mattered to Sears, because we had excellent credit,with several thousand dollars available to us on our Sears cards. </p>
<p>Soon the Manager got on the line, and made all sorts of apologies, and tried to get us to keep their credit card, but we stood firm and said &#8220;No&#8221;. </p>
<p>I have not made one single purchase from Sears since that time. </p>
<p>With this added insult to me, and my family, and Race, I will again tell Sears why I will never shop in one of their Stores. </p>
<p>Action is what is needed. Demonstrate how you feel about this disgusting Ad with your purchasing power, by not shopping at Sears for anything, no matter what the reason. </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go to Sears today, if they were giving their merchandise away. </p>

		<p>The large Sears store in my town went broke and left.  At first I was sad about this but after seeing the ad referenced in this article I say good riddance.<br>
  <br>
Awhile back I took J.C. Penney and Wal-Mart to task on these types of white female/black male ads.<br>
   <br>
I used to receive Penney&rsquo;s weekly flyers by mail, and with each one the miscegenation angle grew stronger and stronger.  The last straw came when one publication showed eight teenage boy-girl ads and six of these paired black boys with drop dead beautiful white teenage girls.<br>
  <br>
It took some doing but I found the CEO in charge of advertising and cut up my credit card and sent it to him along with a letter of complaint, in addition to the offensive weekly flyer.  I used the strongest terms to describe my disgust to him.  </p>
<p>Sometimes I walk through Penney&rsquo;s at the mall and thumb through their advertising brochures.  So far they have been clean. I&rsquo;m sure I wasn&rsquo;t the only one to complain.  </p>
<p>I did the same thing with Wall-Mart. I cut up credit card and sent a letter of complaint to key officers.  I told them that never would I or my business buy anything from them again.  And, I&rsquo;ve stuck to that. They did write me back, but it concerned an admin matter. But I know they read my letter.    </p>
<p>The Wall-Mart offense concerned their baby slings for women.    These ads pictured strikingly handsome young white women using the sling to carrying a black baby around. The message was clear.  It&rsquo;s ok and even desirable for young white girls to have black babies.</p>
<p>Yet all is not lost.  I live in a very traditional part of the country.  It is still common to see young white women at the grocery stores and in the mall with a couple or three white kids in tow. It&rsquo;s also common to see the husband and father with them. </p>
<p>Occasionally I&rsquo;m cast into the role of career counselor. If a young man is considering the military, I provide him with alternatives he may want to consider. <br>
 <br>
As far as the young women, most will eventually admit that all they really want is to marry and have kids like mama did. Many of these girls already have the unsuspecting long legged white boy in their sights. Nevertheless, modern day feminism has some of these girls awful confused. <br>
 <br>
Yes I saw the Lexus commercial.  I will at least send to them an e-mail in protest.   <br>

		<p>Sears ads in the circulars they distribute through the Raleigh News and Observer have been depicting this sort of thing for several years now, so I don&rsquo;t spend my money at Sears any more.  There are several other area retailers who have taken it upon themselves to promote inter-racial romance as a part of their advertising and I believe we need to point out who these culprits are.  By sharing the names of offending retailers Amren visitors and contributors can identify and boycott businesses run by the most openly aggressive of our racial enemies.  The three worst offenders among department stores are JC Penney, Sears and the regional chain Belk&rsquo;s.  As I remember it JC Penny has been hyping miscegenation longer than the other two so I think of them as leaders of the campaign.  This in-your-face advertising garbage has picked up momentum recently, so that now it&rsquo;s hard to find a retailer who hasn&rsquo;t fallen in line with the trend, at least to some extent.  On a second tier of repulsiveness I would add K Mart (sister of Sears) and Macy&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>Corporations led by those who have chosen to join forces with an international elite yearning for our racial destruction don&rsquo;t deserve our money.  We are free to shop where we please, so why should we help fund a bunch of despicable fat cats who hate us?<br>
I hope other Amren contributors will help our cause by naming additional commercial institutions we should avoid whenever possible.     </p>

<p>Remember, these Stores have to pay lots of money toward Employee wages, various Insurance costs, lighting, heat/AC, property rental space, taxes, and yes, even Advertising, which will be  their undoing if they don&rsquo;t get their acts together.</p>

<p>As a white man, I don&rsquo;t much care whether white women date black guys. If they&rsquo;re dating a gang-banger then they&rsquo;re a white girl I wouldn&rsquo;t want to date anyway. If they&rsquo;re dating a good man then, well, good for them and my loss. As it is, ALL of the white women I&rsquo;ve known who&rsquo;ve had a &#8220;thing&#8221; for men of color had something wrong in the head.</p>
<p>As for the commercial, when I see something like that what offends me isn&rsquo;t the act itself, but the (safe) assumption that I&rsquo;m getting lectured to.</p>
