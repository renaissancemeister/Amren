<h1>There&rsquo;s a Shortage of African-American and Latino Jurors in Alameda County. Why?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rina Palta, KALW-FM (San Francisco), Nov. 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new report by the ACLU of Northern California has found that Alameda County&rsquo;s superior court &#8220;suffers from systemic underrepresentation of African-American and Latinos in its jury pools.&#8221; In other words, there&rsquo;s a big shortage of Black and Latino jurors serving on trials. The ACLU took a sampling, looking at jurors in 11 felony trials and broke down in the juror pools by race:</p>
<p>•	While Latinos are about 12 percent of eligible people in Alameda County to serve on trials, they represented 8 percent of the juror pool. Which means one-third of eligible Latinos are not appearing at the courthouse.<br>
	<br>
•	While African-Americans represent about 18 percent of eligible Alameda County residents, 8 percent are appearing for service  &mdash;  less than half of those who are eligible make the juror pool.<br>
	<br>
•	Caucasians are exactly represented in the pool according to residency and eligibility.<br>
	<br>
•	Asian-Americans are actually overrepresented  &mdash;  26 percent of the jury pool; 15 percent of the eligible population.<br>
	<br>
The report identifies several reasons why Alameda County might be suffering this disparity: first, the county uses a computer system that may not do a good enough job of updating people&rsquo;s addresses as they move, which could skew those called in by their likelihood to move (and therefore their income level); second, the county doesn&rsquo;t follow up if people fail to appear for service (don&rsquo;t tell anyone!)  &mdash;  studies have shown that courts can increase their pools by about 25 percent if they do simple things like sending a letter after someone doesn&rsquo;t show up. Interestingly, Alameda County nevertheless summons about five times as many jurors as it actually uses.</p>
<p>Diana Tate Vermeire, the Racial Justice Project director at the ACLU of Northern California, who authored the study, says that attorneys who work in the county have been noticing these disparities for years. The county doesn&rsquo;t seem to be deliberately excluding Latinos and African-Americans from juries, she says, and there are a number of options for remedying the situation. Mainly, updating the juror summoning computer program and starting to respond to those who fail to appear. Vermeire says the county does seem like it wants to act, and it should. &#8220;This is critically important,&#8221; she says. &#8220;People have a right to be tried by their peers and if you don&rsquo;t have racial diversity in the jury, it&rsquo;s calling into question the justice system itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, they have a right to be judged by their peers, not their friends.  Prosecutors know that blacks or latinos on a jury won&rsquo;t convict a black or latino defendant.  But this isn&rsquo;t the case here.  This is about blacks and latinos not showing up for jury duty.  That&rsquo;s it.  No conspiracy.  Just laziness and contempt for the law as I assume it is the law to respond to jury duty in California.  </p>

		<p>If the county court system actually takes these steps, then these same ACLU and racial justice kooks will be screaming &#8220;racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>As someone who has been called for jury duty twice while I was a St. Louis City resident, (not once in many of my new jurisdictions since I moved away), I know first hand why juries might have a relative paucity of blacks   &mdash;   Many prospective black jurors, even the ones that are eligible to serve, (no felony sheet), try every excuse in the book they can to get out.  If they make it to voir dire, then they make any statement they can, whatever they can so that either side&rsquo;s lawyers will reject them.  I am convinced that I have seen and heard prospective black jurors I&rsquo;ve been with at the v.d. stage willingly and knowingly lie, (even though they&rsquo;re under oath), because they&rsquo;ve made statements about somehow knowing the plaintiff or having some links to the plaintiff, and then when I look at the plaintiff, he shrugs his shoulders as if he&rsquo;s clueless, like he really doesn&rsquo;t know this person.  That and their residential geography is rather far apart for them really to be linked so closely.  </p>

<p><br>
What is this nonsense about one&rsquo;s peers?   That is an ancient concept from the Middle Ages, which referred to social station in a highly stratified medieval society, not race. It assured noblemen that they had a right not to be tried by mere commoners. In America&rsquo;s present racial hodgepodge, the original intent is meaningless.  Just what ARE my &#8220;peers&#8221; anyway?  Any ghetto resident from the projects? Any welfare queen seething with hatred against whitey?  What will protect me from these &#8220;peers?</p>

		<p>Jury duty is widely regarded as a civic function, something one does for the betterment of the community. Look at the low percentage of black and Latin parents at PTA meetings. Look at the tiny percent of minorities who are blood donors. Ask a black mother why her son cannot find a compatible kidney donor. See who shows up when a cry goes out for volunteers to fill sand bags. Now tell me you expect whole cultures to turn on a dime and all of a sudden want to contribute?</p>
<p>Call me cynical. </p>

You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m cynical too.  I was called to jury duty in Manhattan (which is full of &#8220;minorities&#8221;). My memory may fail me, but I don&rsquo;t recall ANY black faces there.  None at all! No other &#8220;minorities&#8221; either!</p>

<p>Our peers?  So, she&rsquo;s suggesting that blacks and Hispanics aren&rsquo;t being represented by their peers, because thier peers apparently have to be of the same race as they are.  Isn&rsquo;t that, by definition, &#8220;racist?&#8221;  What if I wanted to be judged by an all-white jury?  Would I be afforded the privilege, nay, the right, to be tried by my peers?</p>

		<p>I live in Southern California, in an area that is less than 30% white.  The last time I went on jury duty, I looked around the waiting room, and I&rsquo;d say 90-95% of the prospective jurors were white.  It actually felt strange to see that many white people all in one place; I&rsquo;m not used to it anymore!  The few nonwhites present were young Asians; they looked like college student types.  There were very, very few blacks or Hispanics.</p>
<p>I figure the reasons are 1. Many of the Hispanics are illegal and thus do not have legitimate driver&rsquo;s licenses or voter registrations.  2.  Even legal blacks and Hispanics tend not to register to vote.  3.  Blacks and Hispanics tend not to care about those silly &#8220;White Man&#8221; rules and laws, and they probably ignore or throw out their jury summons.  (They used to threaten that you could be fined $1,600 for ignoring a jury summons, but I assume, as soon as they discovered that blacks and Hispanics were &#8220;disproportionately affected,&#8221; that was probably the end of that.)</p>
<p>Another thing:  Recently I, and many other people I know, have noticed that we&rsquo;re no longer being sent to serve jury duty at courthouses close to home.  They seem to be forcing people to travel as far as possible now.  I figure this is for &#8220;racial balance.&#8221;  Just one more way we have to be inconvenienced due to &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Since I&rsquo;m not American, this is just a guess:- or, if you prefer, the curse of the White race, deductive, logical thinking. These jury duty letters must emanate from the Court House or similar office and will be in envelopes bearing an official logo or crest as postage is probably free. The recipient will be addressed by their real name, not street slang, and this will be of concern as this can only be bad tidings requiring an immediate move to the next block. &#8216;They know where I put up&rsquo; etc. Even if things progress, the court is a place where criminals are brought and is big and clean, free of graffiti and obviously built and maintained by Whites, has lots of honest looking people with briefcases (which I must not steal) carrying out their official business and there are many police wandering around, some who look as though they know stuff some potential jurors would not like to be identified with. &#8220;What? I can&rsquo;t wear my hooded top and I must pull up my pants and pass through a metal detector? Forget it. Then they expect me to sit still for hours at a time over several days, pay attention and remember boring facts? I didn&rsquo;t do that in school and I&rsquo;m certainly not doing it now. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t know the others, some are White and some from other places. There are some other blacks but I don&rsquo;t recognize their gang colours so this could mean trouble. The accused is black so is probably guilty but I must find him not guilty as I don&rsquo;t know his connections. There must be way out. Anyway, I heard what &#8216;Question Diversity&rsquo; posted on AMREN so I&rsquo;m out of here then I can use my phone, have a smoke, sleep in until noon then hang around and do stuff far more interesting than my civic duty&#8221;</p>

		<p>Number 6, Big Steve has it correct.  Do challenge your thinking by answering the questions presented&hellip;.certain peoples just aren&rsquo;t good citizens.</p>
<p>Peers should mean citizens, not by race, nor by religion, but by citizenship.  Remember when it went unspoken as we all lived our lives?  These diatribes and studies validate the argument that liberalism is a mental disorder, protect your family from these lies at all costs.</p>

		<p>It`s not the blacks who turn black thugs loose,it`s whites who are scared of the repurcussions in the community if blacks riot. The last thing most blacks want on a jury are decent respectable black folk. These people are like NCOs on court martials, they always convict because they know the truth about  thugish blacks. In death penalty cases blacks seldom give a black the chair since they know that alot of blacks were zapped when they didn`t deserve it. Many young blacks don`t show up for jury duty because they fear the warrant man or the child suppport guy.<br>

<p> I lived in Alameda County and have served on juries in the Oakland and Hayward courts. Anytime a white person or white owned company is being judged for &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; the jury will be close to 100% non-white. There are enough white bleeding heart liberals in the jury pool; the lack of color has little effect on the outcome. Sometimes people are so guilty even a racist minority wouldn&rsquo;t set them free. And most victims  of minority crimes are minorities. </p>

		<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Alameda County is very large. It contains all of Oakland and all they way to Livermore. Blacks and latinos are the majority of the population there, they are also the majority of the ones committing the crimes. Who wants criminals deciding the fate of other criminals?</p>

		<p>I have lived in Oakland for forty years and blacks now only constitute 30% of its population but 80% of its criminals. <br>
In San Francisco across the Bay blacks are 6% of the population but at least 60% of the criminals.<br>
Alameda County has notorious leftist Judges, both elected and appointed, who bend over backwards not to find blacks guilty.<br>
Berkeley is also in Alameda County but its black population has been decreasing for decades. However blacks still commit most of the crime in Berkeley. <br>
The political division in California is between the liberal coast,LA and the Bay Area versus the Central Valley and the Inland Empire of Riverside-San Bernadino in southern California.<br>
The Latin factor is crucial here as four million middle class whites have left California since 1990 and a million blacks have also left. Watts and South Central LA is largely Latin now.</p>
