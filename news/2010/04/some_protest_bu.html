<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 100 protesters walked out on former congressman Tom Tancredo as he spoke Monday night on the values of Western culture at UNC-Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>The group stood in unison, yelling, &#8220;No human is illegal,&#8221; before moving outside the Student Union and into the Pit, a concrete courtyard at the center of campus activity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the demonstrators filed out of the union auditorium, Tancredo said fear of debate was driving them away.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re welcome [to leave], but there&rsquo;s nothing democratic about this,&#8221; Tancredo said. &#8220;Believe me, this is a lot better than last time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the fewer than 100 left behind, most shared Tancredo&rsquo;s pro-Western perspective. But when he suggested that conservative student activists never behave as badly as those who broke a window and disrupted his speech last spring, another protester shouted, &#8220;No, you lynched people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m glad that they showed what they really do believe in, and that&rsquo;s censorship,&#8221; Tancredo went on.</p>
<p>Thirty-six UNC public safety and Chapel Hill Police officers guarded the auditorium, four times as many officers as those who forced about 30 protesters out of Bingham Hall last spring.</p>
<p>Last year, officers threatened demonstrators with a Taser weapon and dispersed them with pepper spray.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The event was co-sponsored by the Patrick Henry Center for Individual Liberty and the Leadership Institute.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Pit, student groups held a pro-immigrant rally and accused Tancredo of racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hateful discourse amplified by money and access to media create the foundation upon which Minutemen and the KKK operate,&#8221; wrote Feminist Students United in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Tancredo] said Democrats view immigrants as potential votes and Republicans view them as cheap labor, sapping any political will to tighten borders.</p>

							<i>Kevin DeAnna, Youth for Western Civilization, April 27, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>I just returned from our event at the University of North Carolina where Congressman Tom Tancredo spoke to a supportive audience. Conservatives from around the state  &mdash;  and even outside the state  &mdash;  attended to hear Congressman Tancredo&rsquo;s common sense message about border security, conservative resistance to big government, and pride in our shared Western Civilization. Thanks to both the Patrick Henry Center and CampusReform.org for their help in funding and promoting this event.</p>
<p>The media is reporting that 100 protesters walked out of the speech. I think they added a zero to that estimate. The fact is, after all the talk, and all the posturing, and all the militant rhetoric about shutting us down, all we had to deal with tonight is a tiny group of little kids who couldn&rsquo;t even summon the numbers to form a halfway decent drum circle. We barely noticed when they left and were laughing hysterically. This is it? This is the great left wing vanguard? I&rsquo;ve seen more leftists at half price day at Starbucks.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s speech was well received by the audience. During the question and answer period, Tom was able to speak on a wide range of topics and mingle with audience members afterward for more discussion. A number of people approached me afterwards and asked, &#8220;What exactly is controversial about this?&#8221; I&rsquo;ve been asking the same question for a year now.</p>
<p>This is a great victory for Youth for Western Civilization. In the year since our last visit, even with the loss of some major grant programs that we used to fund speeches last year, we&rsquo;ve built a full time staff, formed new chapters around the country, and gained increasing legitimacy within the conservative movement. We are immeasurably stronger than last year. We are poised for a strong finish to this school year and will shock the country with our presence next fall.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Daryl Ann Dunigan, chairman of UNC YWC, for making this possible. </p>
<p>We will have pictures, video, and more reports about this event tomorrow. This is a big week for us so stay tuned to WesternYouth.org for more updates about events from around the country.</p>
<p>Conservatives, YWC is the campus resistance. We are growing, and we will win. Join us today!</p>

Yes, all humans should be able to migrate to the USA. I believe 50% of Mexicans want to, which would add another 50 million. Then there is China and India. With over a billion population each, I&rsquo;m sure would could gather at least another 500 million to our population.</p>
<p>As I have stated before, the most disastrous laws ever enacted were the 1965 immigration and civil rights laws. We already know that it is a civil right to have health insurance, so how could we deprive them of food, which is even more necessary than health-care. But wait, there is another civil right that every person is entitled to &hellip; shelter. </p>
<p>Now if I am thinking properly, if a person was guaranteed food, shelter, and health-care for free, no one would need to work. Of course we know how this ends. There would be a new law requiring people to work as slaves for the government to pay for all these &#8220;free&#8221; benefits. If they don&rsquo;t comply, they would be thrown into<br>
prison with hard labor. </p>
<p>Sounds to me like a Police State. But this is what it is all about. The Democrats and the Republicans only care which of the two parties can be supreme leaders over all these slaves.<br>

<p>This little dork is getting hysterical, because he&rsquo;s been told that Tancredo is part of a conservative element that &#8220;lynches&#8221; people, and he&rsquo;s just too dumb to understand he&rsquo;s being used, and he&rsquo;s been fed propaganda and lies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to really dig into the backgrounds of these types to find out how they are so easily duped into believing whatever they&rsquo;ve been programmed to believe.  If they would submit to intensive interrogation, much could be learned also about why they are effected so greatly while others regard propaganda with a wary eye.  These types are more apt to commit vandalism and tear things up than the average nut case, also.</p>
<p>Who could get so bent out of shape he/she would break windows, throw molotov cocktails, strip nude and run through the streets, all because they detest some kind of capitalist summit?  Or a speaker at a university?  Or a speaker on White Nationalism?  Or somebody like Tom Tancredo or Ann Coulter who are really part of the establishment?</p>
<p>If and when this country separates&hellip;peacefully or through civil war&hellip;.into ethnic enclaves, it would be important to recognize which white individuals have a propensity for gullibility so intensely as to break apart hysterically, unable to control themselves, because these types would NOT be ones I would want to have around no matter what their mindset was at the moment.  Anybody that unsophisticated is just a blooming idiot that hasn&rsquo;t yet reached maturity but will soon after the right verbal fertilizer is applied to their brains.</p>
<p>After many centuries it&rsquo;s beginning to become evident that a portion of the population just can&rsquo;t handle living in a free-speech society, because they can be easily turned anyway an unscrupulous fools wants them to.</p>

<p>Tom Tancredo, former civics teacher, seemingly polite, mild-mannered and monotonic, has become a speaker feared far and wide: bunnies spontaneously combust, frogs fall dead from the sky, rivers run backward, and open-border university students flee and jump heedlessly into a bottomless &#8220;Pit,&#8221; or we can only hope. <br>

		<p>I would love to camp out on the doorsteps of these protesters&rsquo; homes and demand to be let in, and when they threaten to call the police, I would scream belligerently at them, &#8220;Hey, no human is illegal! You said so yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>The idiocy of these people is just hard to fathom.</p>
<p>And fewer than 100 stayed to hear Tancredo speak? That seems disappointingly low, but I understand this was not an official convocation.</p>
<p><i> Meanwhile, in the Pit, student groups held a pro-immigrant rally and accused Tancredo of racism.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Racism&#8221; is the word liberals use when they&rsquo;re losing the argument.</p>

		<p>I am at least gratified that my alma mater allowed Tancredo his say.  But I am thoroughly DISGUSTED with the childish antics of the students of liberal persuasion.  When I was at UNCCH in 1976-77, there was respect given to ALL viewpoints.  Everyone was allowed to speak, and audiences were polite and attentive.  These people today have no manners, are incapable of self-discipline, and behave like lower-class ghettoites.  In my day they were called &#8220;common;&#8221; and that word was synonomous with low class, disgusting, and it was something no one wanted to be.  These kids and adults of today, though, don&rsquo;t seem to care how low they go, as long as they get to hear themselves scream.  My 94 year old Aunt Kay would say, &#8220;Now, that&rsquo;s awfully common, don&rsquo;t you think?&#8221;  Yes, Aunt Kay, I do.</p>

Did exactly that to a furniture refinisher who had kept our family heirlooms for over a year and a half. Actually it was his mothers home which made it that much sweeter and more effective. The first day of the siege he told me to follow him to the shop. Then he ditched me at a light in traffic. The second day, I wouldn`t move my truck out of his  mom`s driveway till he let my friend ride in his. Got my stuff back but not my $800.00 I still considered it a victory.<br>
  That very night there was a story on the local news about a woman who showed up at  yet another shop with a reporter. They could see her  Great Grandmother`s writing desk through a crack in the  warehouse door. The man refused to give it back even as the woman cried cause it was soo close. He said he intended to &#8220;finish it soon&#8221;. The reporter finally talked  some sense into him. The woman`s  gratitude to the reporter  was so genuine it moved me to tears. I found out later that roofers and furniture refinishers have more consumer complaints by far than any other trade&hellip;</p>

		<p>If Tancredo really wants to have an impact than he should hire a bunch of specialists propaganda and manipulation (just like the left does) and come up with an appeal that works on these people (the ones heckling him).</p>
<p>What he is talking about directly effects their own self interest.  Yet, when simply describing how that is so, they put their fingers in their ears and shout &#8220;lalalalalal&hellip;..I&rsquo;m not listening to your fascist hate filled diatribe&hellip;..lalalalal&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, something more than logical arguments is at work here.  Some carefully planned and implemented brain washing.  But, here is the thing.  Since the position they take IS so far outside their own best interests, the denial involved demands incredible mental energy to maintain.  It&rsquo;s always teetering on the edge of collapse (which is why so many liberal college students turn into conservatives a few months after they graduate).</p>
<p>Tancredo needs an emotional appeal designed to burst their bubble.  For example, a giant, blow up picture of a crime scene where a family was killed by mexicans.</p>
<p>When, they shout their slogans, he can turn to them and tearfully ask how they could be so hard hearted as to turn their backs on suffering victims like in the picture.</p>
<p>Just an example of what is possible and what the focus should be with regard to issues like this.  I could make the same observation about Amren and Jared Taylor.  The logical arguments and facts are on your side&hellip;.and that works for a certain small segment of society.  But you should seriously consider co-opting the methods of the enemy (they did, after all, get the worst of the worst elected president using these methods).  Being right isn&rsquo;t enough.  Winning the argument isn&rsquo;t enough.  You need to be persuasive.</p>

		<p>Today&rsquo;s NYT printed the following in its &#8220;National Briefing&#8221; column today : <br>
 <br>
Judge William F. Downes of Federal District Court ruled Tuesday that the University of Wyoming must allow William Ayers, a member of the radical Weather Underground in the 1960s, to speak there. The university had cited threats of violence in canceling his speech at an event planned for Wednesday. But Judge Downes ruled that threats could not be used as a reason to deny Mr. Ayers&rsquo;s right to speak. Mr. Ayers, a professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, was invited by the Social Justice Research Center at the university.</p>
<p>&hellip;/&hellip;</p>
<p>I had to read this briefing twice: naturally, thoughts of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s conference being shut down came to mind. </p>
<p>Also: Amrenners should check out the Youth for Western Civilization site sited above. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.westernyouth.org/authors/kevin-deanna/" rel="nofollow">http://www.westernyouth.org/authors/kevin-deanna/</a></p>
<p>It is a refreshingly well-written site. <br>

		<p>This whole problem comes down to one thing, and one thing only: freedom of association.</p>
<p>Is it wrong for white people to want to live in their own countries, with their own people? If so, why?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t white people allowed to have their own countries any more?</p>
<p>Ask any of these liberal protestors these simple questions, and they won&rsquo;t have an answer.</p>
<p>The real answer is: white people aren&rsquo;t allowed to have their own countries any more, because third world people want to TAKE what they cannot make - a successful civilisation, with all the benefits it brings.</p>
