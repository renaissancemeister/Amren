<h1>Animosity Between Light and Dark-Skinned African Americans Causes Division</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Courtney Bledsoe, The Famuan (Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University), April 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Skin color has been an issue in the black community for years. Hostility between light and dark- skinned African Americans has caused a skin divide within our communities. It was not until the topic, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like my hair texture or the color of my skin,&#8221; on the Michael Baisden Show, when I was awakened to a world of self-hate, which saddened me.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Young girls were calling and saying, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like that my dark is skin&#8221; and &#8220;I hate the texture of my hair.&#8221; Young boys called in to say that they would not talk to a girl of a darker complexion.</p>
<p>Since the days of slavery, color has been used as a tool of separation and preferential treatment among African Americans. The residue of the &#8220;house&#8221; and &#8220;field&#8221; negro divide has long remained with us even during the 1970s as we celebrated black pride.</p>
<p>Allison Samuels of Newsweek states, &#8220;House slaves were usually products of the slave master and a female slave so they usually had lighter skin. The masters&rsquo; mixed children, although not always given the best treatment, were more likely to receive the special favor of doing housework. Thus, making them exempt from the hard task of working in the sun. They learned to read, write and often ate better.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A study was published in 2006 in the Race, Gender and Class Journal, indicated that lighter complexions were considered more attractive among African-American communities. The results were taken from a sample of 100 students who indicated that 96 percent of men preferred a medium to light complexion in women, while 70 percent of women found light skin of value in men. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What makes the African-American culture unique is the complex shades of our skin; embrace it.</p>

<p>Really? Then why is there a similar schism among blacks of different shades in all white countries, including those that never practiced slavery? This is just another attempt to excuse the bigotry and prejudice of blacks and blame them on someone else. And by the way, it&rsquo;s been a long time since the 1970s, not to mention slavery days. But the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; will be milked for ten times ten thousand years if it will continue to serve some kind of benefit.</p>

		<p>Whites have the same problem, but from the opposite side.So many of us spend so much time in sun tanning saloons and in the sun.But at least we dont blame it on black racism, or black supremacy.And a lot of dark complected black women are quite attractive.</p>

		<p>If we&rsquo;re all the same &#8220;except&#8221; for skin color why do different shaded Blacks fight with each other?</p>
<p>In any case the media relentlessly promotes Black men with lighter skinned or White women.  Look at newspapers, magazines, companies on the Internet, TV, movies - EVERYWHERE - we see it, relentless images of Black men with lighter skinned or White women.  And it is increasing.  The media and advertisers are increasing their pace with this.  The purpose of this is to condition our subconscious minds to become accustomed to seeing Black men with light-skinned or White women.  As we see more and more of this we begin to believe that it is society changing naturally or literally by itself.  This however is not the case.  Because the conditioning is so slow - year by year, decade by decade, generation by generation, most people don&rsquo;t perceive it as someone&rsquo;s or some group&rsquo;s agenda, Joe Sixpack and Sally Soccer-mom just think it&rsquo;s natural and think there&rsquo;s nothing they can do about it.</p>
<p>The images are also becoming less and less subtle.  For example I viewed a well-known job-search company&rsquo;s website today, and in a photo on one of their pages were 5 people depicted:</p>
<p>3 White women and 2 non-White men AND -<br>
The Black man was in the center<br>
The Black man was the Tallest<br>
The Black man was leaning to his right and had his arm around the two White women to his right!</p>
<p>The image&rsquo;s message is quite obvious to me.  As more and more White people become awakened this agenda should become more and more obvious to them as well.</p>

		<p>Once again the blacks seem to believe that all of their envies and miseries are rooted in slavery.  And for the millionth time we hear the highly improbable story that miscegenation was the case of slave masters raping female slaves.</p>
<p>What seems far likelier is that light skin is a universal standard of beauty, and female slaves occasionally seduced field hands (not &#8220;the master&#8221;) in hopes of giving their children an advantage in life, that which comes with lighter skin and greater intelligence.</p>

		<p>One thing that I find weird is that a lot of the top fashion models are dark skinned such as Iman and Alek Wek, who are both from Africa. There are not many light skinned top models walking the runways either. I guess the light vs dark skin issue is more of an American one than an problem worldwide.</p>

		<p>I highly doubt that house slaves were actually any less black than the field slaves.  The reason I think that is that the first real wave of mulattoes (outside of southern Louisiana) came after the WBTS, and was a result of well paid enemy occupying soldiers procuring the services of recently freed black women who had no economic prospects otherwise.  </p>

		<p>I can attest to the fact that blacks DO get on each other&rsquo;s case for their skin color.  When I was teaching first grade in a black area, a father came in to complain that his (very light) black son had been called a &#8220;n****r&#8221; by a darker-skinned girl out on the playground.  He said it happened all the time, and wanted to know what I would tell his son if he was my kid.  I stupidly thought he wanted honesty, and so I told him I&rsquo;d tell my kid to deal with it, because it WAS a reality and would happen again and again.  I said I&rsquo;d tell him to realize that the kids who were picking on him were jealous, and to pay them no mind.  Finally, I told him I&rsquo;d tell his kid to tell the teacher on duty if it got way out of hand.  The father was furious and had his kid taken out of my class - I hadn&rsquo;t been PC enough.  So it&rsquo;s a reality all right - but it&rsquo;s a reality that the blacks themselves are going to have to deal with and solve.  It isn&rsquo;t our problem.</p>

		<p>I wish I weren&rsquo;t attracted to black women. It&rsquo;s been more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth. I&rsquo;ve tried to wean myself and to see the beauty in white females, but there&rsquo;s something about a smooth dark complexion that floats my boat. People who know me  &mdash;  black, white, or otherwise  &mdash;  think it&rsquo;s cool though a little odd; apparently few men of any race find black women particularly attractive.</p>
<p>Like #5 said, a lot of the top models are dark skinned Africans. I&rsquo;d jump over ten white women to get to one! What the problem is with African-American males, I don&rsquo;t know. The white women they end up with aren&rsquo;t even attractive as white women most of the time. Just part of the demographic&rsquo;s endless dysfunctionality, I guess.</p>
<p>My problem has never been with the way black women  &mdash;  other than the morbidly obese ones  &mdash;  look; it&rsquo;s with the way they ACT! Maybe black males feel that lighter skinned ones or whites will be easier to bully around.</p>

		<p>Several have touched upon it already but indeed, this has nothing whatever to do with slavery! This phenomenon is global  and apparently persists among ALL &#8220;people of color&#8221; the world over. American blacks see everything through the prism of the slavery experience - which is just what they have been taught to do.  </p>

		<p>I was immediately concerned about the value of the article as it originated with Florida A&M; University (FAMU).  This is an all black state university that is not much shy of being a diploma mill.  The students are accepted with much lower standards than any other university in the state system and receive free tuition and living expenses almost to a one.  The highest crime rate in any section of Tallahassee is that which includes FAMU.  The school has been on probation more times than the Animal House frat.  Just recently the school was on academic probation from the accreditation agency.  Prior to that, an audit discovered millions and millions of missing money.  The audit also uncovered nepotism as a school &#8220;policy&#8221; and so much missing inventory and property that the state just wrote it off.  No charges were filed by the State Attorney&rsquo;s office, a political arrangement.  There is so much more unbelievable information to give about this place&hellip;  So you see the real story is not the subject of the article.</p>

		<p>In the early 20th century, there were clubs where light skin was a requirement for becoming a member. Another example is that the chorus line at Harlem&rsquo;s Cotton Club, which was owned by a white gangster required that the girls be tall, tan and terrific. They had to be at least 5&rsquo;6&#8221;, they had to be lighter than a brown paper bag, and under 21. The owner wanted the girls to be cotton colored.Darker skinned dancers were allowed to join the chorus line in the late 1930&rsquo;s.</p>

I fail to understand what was wrong with your answer. What did this father WANT?  <br>
And why should he ask YOU what to tell his kid? That&rsquo;s not within the scope of teaching. He&rsquo;s the kid&rsquo;s father;  let HIM deal with it. It&rsquo;s his responsibility.</p>

		<p>In related news the sky is blue, grass is green and church services are still held on Sundays.  More on this at 11.</p>
<p>In all seriousness however, I think this more than anything else is why the darker races marry out of their race, while the whiter ones tend to stay in it(say what you will about mixed couples, when you look at percentages in places like the UK/US you see that whites stay within their race moreso than any other racial group - it just looks like we don&rsquo;t because we&rsquo;re a majority in both countries and thus there are a lot more of us).</p>

		<p>To poster #3.  I have noticed this same technique in advertising for a long time now, and now it&rsquo;s gotten far worse.  I get a lot of teacher magazines, and in the adverts and photos for the news stories, there is rarely - if ever - any white male teacher shown.  The diversity fantasy always has a tall, confident black man in the center of attention surrounded by women of various races.  Sometimes there is an asian man or latino, but almst never a white male.</p>
<p>In kids advertising or in Target catalogs, etc. you see that even with montages of kids, the carefully chosen races and postures are there.  The white boys are always paired with an asian or black girl.  The black boys are always with white girls, etc.  </p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t mind interracial relationships per se, and I&rsquo;m in one myself, but this push in the media shows you how widespread the diversity cult is in corporate america.  Cultural and racial interactions should not be forced or promoted as a mandate.  Let people be with who they want and don&rsquo;t pressure them to make some rainbow multicultural utopia.</p>

		<p>#4 I think you got a better handle on the lighter skinned blacks origination than the slave master theory.</p>
<p>If I owned Black slaves in any era and impregnated one or more &hellip;the last thing I would do is have that constant reminder to my white legitimate  children (and their mother especially). I would send the kid to the furthest end of the plantation or better yet&hellip;sell to another plantation.</p>

		<p>The attitudes about dark- vs. light-skinned blacks is universal&hellip;in the Dominican Republic it is blatant, with light-skinned blacks treating dark-skinned blacks with contempt on a sliding scale. Likewise in Brazil, Cuba, and throughout Africa. The whole thing is so stupid&hellip;when Martin Luther King said people should be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin, he wasn&rsquo;t talking about just white vs. black, but black vs. black, too.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Allison Samuels of Newsweek states, &ldquo;House slaves were usually products of the slave master and a female slave so they usually had lighter skin&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This contention of &#8216;House slaves as a product of slave/slave master&rsquo; (implying White rape) is taken, of course, without a shred of proof by the msm and passed on to the general public as an axiom.  To counter, question or challenge what this AA journalist writes is racism and hate.</p>
<p>It has been my experience around American blacks that to call another black a &#8216;House N&rsquo; is one of the worst insults possible.  Every once in a while a black caller would manage to get around the call screener on Larry Elder&rsquo;s late show in LA and call him &#8216;nothing but a House N doing massa bidding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But to black thinking House Ns, whom they so scorn and who they believe to be &#8216;half White&rsquo;, are to be emulated, their lighter visage considered desirable and attractive:  &#8220;96 percent of black men preferred a medium to light complexion in women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, which is it?  Blacks claim to hate and despise us (as do most other non-Whites) but fall all over themselves to imitate us by lightening their skin and hair (yes, I know it&rsquo;s envy).  </p>
<p>Found in Michael Jackson&rsquo;s house:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; a stash of 19 tubes of the skin-bleaching agent hydroquinone and 18 tubes of Benoquin, a skin-whitening cream commonly prescribed to those suffering from extensive vitiligo, a disease that attacks pigmentation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But that was only to treat &#8216;vitiligo&rsquo;, right, just like the multiple, painful, plastic and laser surgeries to make the shape of his face and nose more White and his insistence on adopting children that are so obviously White (except, perhaps, &#8216;blanket&rsquo;).</p>
<p>This black journalist should be called out and asked why blacks find light skin so attractive, why they don&rsquo;t darken themselves in solidarity with their truly dark slave ancestors from the mother country, those who toiled for master in the fields, those that didn&rsquo;t have a drop of White blood in them, the ones they constantly remind us to this day were so mistreated that every living White should turn over his wealth to the black community (for squander).</p>
<p>Blacks hate us so much that they fall all over themselves to not only copy us but to look like us as well.</p>

		<p>True story: Back in the seventies I worked Summers on a family farm. Without exception, all young black female migrant workers made known the sexual availability to me in no uncertain terms. The most likely reason was perceived favors I might offer in return. A secondary consideration is a reproduction strategy as the available black males had very little on the ball if absolutely nothing (most blew their paychecks on malt liquor and drugs then ate cat food the rest of the week). This reality was likely in overdrive one hundred and fifty years ago. </p>
<p>Additionally, once generous welfare and social programs kicked in during the seventies, black migrant workers vanished within a two-year period. Mexican migrants replaced them on the farm and these individuals were much more hardworking, so it was a &#8220;win&#8221; in the hearts and minds of farmers. Of course, now that we are down the road, it appears blacks cannot get enough free stuff and those initial migrants went home and let their friends and families know a much higher standard of living was available in El Norte. Sadly second generation hispanics are far less productive than their parents and highly prone to crime, teen pregnancy, joining gangs and dropping out of school.</p>

		<p>21 Bon: The pitch that slave women were raped by their masters is questionable on two counts.  First, it assumes that the women did not offer themselves to the men, when they would have benefitted by doing so.  They would have ingratiated themselves with their betters, and would have gotten more intelligent children at the same time.  In turn, the more intelligent children would have risen in the slave hierarchy and been in a position to help out Mama.  (This is, BTW, what Filipino internet brides are all about.  Marry some old White guy, move to America, the land of running water and electricity, and send money home.)  Women have been offering themselves to powerful men forever, so there&rsquo;s no reason to imagine that African women are any different.  And they&rsquo;re hardly chaste, in America or Africa.<br>
     Second, why assume that it was the master who donated the seed?  There were a lot of other White men around, many of whom would have much more direct contact with the Blacks.  Most American Blacks are African with some White trash thrown in. </p>

		<p>Authoritative studies have now show that certain standards of beauty are universal:  those indicating health, youth, and fertility.  In every culture, lighter skin is interpreted as more beautiful, probably because it is seen as youthful on a subconscious level.  Lighter skinned and white women therefore appeal to men in this instinctual way.  There are, of course, a few exceptions, but they are statistical outliers.  For black men, then, white women may represent a kind of hyper-youthfulness to their subconscious.</p>
<p>But human beings are complex, and this is only part of the explanation in the case of black men.  Malcolm X, is his more revolutionary days, exhorted black men to take the white man&rsquo;s woman.  Sex can be political, too.</p>
<p>On the subject of advertising:  I have also noticed that in the majority of TV images, whether in product advertising or in the shows themselves, a white, blonde woman is placed in direct proximity to a black man.  The advertisers do this consciously (the director says, &#8220;you stand over here next to her and you both lean into each other&#8221;).  All of the media, obviously, are political in their perspective.  They are promoting miscegenation as furiously as possible.</p>
<p>The real problem white advocates face is the weakness of white men.  Women are always attracted to the most powerful men, and white men have become passive in the face of assaults on our culture, our status, our very existence.  Therefore, white men are less attractive to our own women.  I am not disgusted with blacks.  I am disgusted with the current generation of pansy white men.  Earlier generations of white men would not have tolerated waves of dark invaders or leftists who wage psychological warfare against us.</p>
<p>I have decided not to be so passive.  For example, at the college where I work, everyone knows that I will speak up against &#8220;diversity hiring&#8221; and call it what is its  &mdash;  racism against whites.  Everyone knows they&rsquo;re going to have a tough fight when they bring up their PC.  I wish I had more comrades to stand with me!</p>

<p>Black men pursue white women relentlessly so they are going to have some success. (If I stand on a corner and ask every women who walks by for a date eventually one is going to say yes)</p>

		<p>Once again, we come upon that myth of white slave owners &#8216;raping&rsquo; their black slavewomen, as the primary source of the white genes in American blacks.</p>
<p>So, once again, I feel the need to urge everyone to research The Highland Clearances and the enslavement of whites in Colonial America.</p>
<p>In the very same way that America&rsquo;s elites today glorify blacks and demonize their less-ascendant white kin, the elites of the colonies greatly valued their black slaves, while vilifying and brutalizing their white &#8216;indentured servants&rsquo;.  The blacks were well cared-for, while the white men were deliberately worked to death.  </p>
<p>In such a world, it is easy to imagine how white women, their menfolk having &#8220;died of exertion&#8221; might have voluntarily (or as the result of direct or implicit duress)taken up with Africans.  The hybrid children, it was hoped by the slave-owners, would possess some of the higher intelligence and docile behavior of Europeans, but would also possess the heat-resistance and physical strength of the African.  </p>
<p>And please note that in addition to white slave owners and overseers, there were other white men on the plantations; most notably white male slaves.  Knowing black women, I do not find it unlikely that some might have taken a fancy to the blond Scots and Irishmen there in the slavequarters. I sincerely doubt that these women were frigid: so why NOT go for the pretty white man?  And as for the plantation Owner&hellip;.it is only natural for many or most females to go for STATUS.  Bedding the &#8216;boss man&rsquo; would be the ultimate conquest.  We&rsquo;ve all seen the portraits: the Plantation Aristocracy were thrillingly BEAUTIFUL people.  Assignations with members of that group would hardly have been noxious chores.</p>
<p>However, as a Southerner, I can quite easily distinguish between black-white-Indian admixtures.  I can spot Arawak heritage in the blacks of Mobile, Mediterranean White/French in the blacks of South Louisiana, and flat-faced Scotch/Irish in the blacks of the inland South.  Simply from that casual observation, my guess is that the primary source of non-African genes in black Americans is from Scotch/Irish slaves and Native Americans, and not from Norman English slave owners.</p>

		<p>&#8220;To poster #3. I have noticed this same technique in advertising for a long time now, and now it&rsquo;s gotten far worse. I get a lot of teacher magazines,&hellip;there is rarely - if ever - any white male teacher shown. The diversity fantasy always has a tall, confident black man in the center of attention surrounded by women of various races [always lighter]. Sometimes there is an asian man or latino, but almst never a white male.&#8221;   &mdash;  - Jay<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
It&rsquo;s the same with recruiting materials for the Armed Forces. Or for police departments, etc. Indeed, it&rsquo;s everywhere.   Hardly a white male ever to be seen. Always blacks in positions of very obvious authority, and an occasional tough white female who&rsquo;s &#8220;in charge&#8221; but preferably a Hispanic or Asian female. Never a white male in a position of authority. Never!  When and if white males are shown (however rare), they&rsquo;re in the background as underlings and obvious menials. </p>
<p>Why do we so passively put up with this phony social engineering?  It&rsquo;s sheer Marxist brainwashing rubbish!  The whole country seems to have capitulated to it without a whimper. </p>

&ldquo;&hellip;Allison Samuels of Newsweek states, &ldquo;House slaves were usually products of the slave master and a female slave so they usually had lighter skin&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
This contention of &lsquo;House slaves as a product of slave/slave master&rsquo; (implying White rape) is taken, of course, without a shred of proof by the msm and passed on to the general public as an axiom. To counter, question or challenge what this AA journalist writes is racism and hate.<br>
    &mdash;  -BON <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The French, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies, with their more relaxed  Latin attitudes towards sex and human frailty, were more accepting of the master&rsquo;s illegitimate children, who were often raised and educated alongside his own.  The Anglo-Saxon colonies, with their stricter  Protestant morality, were much  less forgiving   &mdash;    or tolerant of these sexual strayings.  But in France, Spain, and Portugal, where kings customarily had their mistresses and their illegitimate families on the side   &mdash;   quite openly  (and sometimes several of them)   &mdash;    even giving them titles and positions at court,  this was not viewed askance.  After all, if the king did it&hellip; well, who was to criticize?  It was socially acceptable.  In fact, even the Popes did it, at that time. So, among Catholics it was not considered anything unusual.  Nor morally shocking.   </p>
<p>If so, the master may have had offspring  (as in the Jefferson  &mdash;  Hemmings example, if we just assume for the moment that it&rsquo;s true)   &mdash;    not by a &#8220;black&#8221; slave but by someone who was already considerably lightened up.  (Sally Hemmings was already one-quarter or one-eighth white and was his dead wife&rsquo;s half sister.)  It seems highly improbable that a fastidious  aristocrat would have been raping unwashed black slaves out of the field!  Nor  hanging around the slave quarters at night!  That&rsquo;s sheer fantasy in the overheated brains of modern novelists.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it was not &#8220;rape&#8221;   &mdash;  - not as normally portrayed.  Neither here nor in Europe.  A European nobleman would not have to chase, pin down, and  rape a servant!  Nor would he.  And the servant would have been grateful for the position in the house;  she would also have benefited from having a child by the master. She would be taken care of and the child would be educated and given a good position.  But if not rape, it could certainly be called exploitation, from our own modern point of view.   However, seen in the larger historical context, this sexual exploitation was what had been going on in feudal society, in Europe, <b>for many generations and many hundreds of years,</b> where  the master of the estate    &mdash;   and the nobility in general    &mdash;   had access to the servants at his  pleasure.    (Ever heard of Droit du Seigneur?)   This is simply how it was in Europe,and always had been, and the pattern was transferred to the New World.  A Southern plantation was just a replica of a feudal estate in Europe, as the gentry had known it,  but with black peasants in lieu of white.   White servants had been going through this for centuries.  It was simply the norm.</p>
<p>It was also, btw, the pattern in the Turkish world, and the Arab world. Doubtless  even more so there!  And also in Persia and India. Probably China  and Japan as well.  That is to say, the rich and powerful have always taken advantage of the humble and the weak&hellip;. no matter where.  This  exploitation was NOT a characteristic unique to the American South!   Nor was it a racial thing, since it happened everywhere. It seems to be a human thing.  (How many executives today take advantage of their secretaries?   How many view the typing pool as their own private harem?)</p>
<p>And, yes,  though the idea contains some basic truth  (but less so in North America than elsewhere),    it&rsquo;s been fed by journalists, movie makers, and novelists who generally have an axe to grind (or a dollar to make).   I still remember a 1993 TV series, &#8220;Queen, the Story of an American Family&#8221;.  This allegedly  &#8221; historical documentary series&#8221;   was written by Alex Haley, a known plagiarist and inventor of  self-serving &#8220;history&#8221;.  I only remember the memorable Ann Margaret who played the matriarch of a Southern plantation, embarrassed by her husband&rsquo;s infidelities,  who sternly warned  the  mixed-race protagonist, &#8220;Queen&#8221;  (upon discovering who her real father was), &#8220;You are NEVER to speak of this!  You understand me?   NEVER!!!&#8221;   Dramatization, yes.   But doubtless some grain of  truth iit.</p>
<p> [Queen: &#8220;a partly factual historical novel,  starring Halle Berry,  describing the plight of the children of the plantation: the offspring of black slave women and their white masters, who were legally their fathers&rsquo; slaves&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen:_The_Story_of_an_American_Family" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen:_The_Story_of_an_American_Family</a> ]</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It has been my experience around American blacks that to call another black a &lsquo;House N&rsquo; is one of the worst insults possible. &#8221;  </i>    </p>
<p> Mine too.   Much like &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221;.  But I suppose, in the revolutionary lexicon, &#8220;House N&#8221;  is  worse. It is definitely a revolutionary term, designed to arouse rage (against whites).</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But to black thinking House Ns, whom they so scorn and whom they believe to be &lsquo;half White&rsquo;, are to be emulated, their lighter visage considered desirable and attractive: &ldquo;96 percent of black men preferred a medium to light complexion in women.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>And the greatest irony is that virtually ALL of their leaders today are descendents of those  &#8220;HouseNs&#8221;. Without them, they would have no leaders.   (And even Obama, although not of slave descent, is also  only part-black.   I understand he does have white slave-owners on his mother&rsquo;s side.  So he can pass for a &#8220;HouseN&#8221;. )<br>

<p>One thing about this light skin/dark skin debate is that there is a limit to the light side for at least some of us. I don&rsquo;t think too many whites, like myself, go for the ultra-white, never-absorbed-ray-of-sunshine types of white people. To me, a super-white woman is just not attractive, but, on the other hand, she is still more attractive that most any black woman (I don&rsquo;t really care for black women&rsquo;s appearance. But the &#8220;attitude&#8221;, racism and manner of speeech so common among them, and, of course, those same things likely found in her family members are the worst part.)</p>

<p>Regardless of whether anyone cares to believe in the Sally Hemmings allegation or not (and I take no position on it), the undeniable fact remains that Sally was the half-sister of Jefferson&rsquo;s wife and was thus the aunt of his children.  Very simply, she was &#8220;family&#8221; in the most literal sense of the word.  Her father was Jefferson&rsquo;s father-in-law.  Naturally, Jefferson provided for her and took care of her for the rest of her life. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply a romantic liason, but just a family relationship&hellip; and a deep sense of obligation.</p>
<p>Thank you for the correction.  I don&rsquo;t know how I could have let slip such a foolish mistake!<br>

 &#8220;I highly doubt that house slaves were actually any less black than the field slaves. The reason I think that is that the first real wave of mulattoes (outside of southern Louisiana) came after the WBTS&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Sorry, but I have to disagree with you on that. Look, for example, at the Hemmings story (mentioned above) which was already the case one hundred years BEFORE the war.  A lighter house slave would have been considered prize material by all the other slaves (no different from their attitudes today); and a male house slave (often the butler who was in charge of the others) would have had access to all the other blacks on the plantation, most of whom would have glad for his attentions. </p>
<p>Thus, you could say,  &#8220;the butler did it&#8221; &hellip; quite literally. He probably had many children by many women, and thus spread the genes around the plantation. It would not have been necessary for the master to get involved with the slaves, personally, once you had a few mulattoes taking advantage of their status. They were the Jesse Jacksons and Rev. Wrights of their day, looked up to and sought after (in every way!) by the others. Just as they still are.<br>

 &#8220;One thing that I find weird is that a lot of the top fashion models are dark skinned such as Iman and Alek Wek, who are both from Africa. There are not many light skinned top models walking the runways either.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Those truly &#8220;black&#8221; models are there for their contrast and shock value, not their beauty. There is a very conscious effort in the industry to be as diverse and as representative as possible. Thus, to be politically correct, you need to have something of this and something of that. Wek is Sudanese, about as exotic and unusual as you can get.  But would you consider her beautiful?<br>
