<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36572428/ns/health-kids_and_parenting/">More US Babies Born With Syphilis</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More U.S. babies are being born with syphilis, many of them to women in the South who use crack cocaine and work in the sex trade, according to a U.S. government report released on Thursday.</p>
<p>The troubling trend reverses a 14-year decline and shows the infection, already on the uptick among gay and bisexual men, is worsening in the heterosexual community, the team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;After declining for 14 years, the congenital syphilis rate among infants aged under 1 year increased 23 percent, from 8.2 cases per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 10.1 during 2008,&#8221; the CDC team reported in the agency&rsquo;s weekly report on death and disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;That increase followed a 38 percent increase in the &hellip; syphilis rate among females aged more than 10 years from 2004 to 2007.&#8221; The biggest increases were in the South and among black women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recent increases in &hellip; syphilis among black women in the south have been linked to crack cocaine use and commercial sex work,&#8221; the report added. Increases &#8220;might portend a larger increase in the congenital syphilis rate in 2009 and future years.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last November, CDC officials said squeamishness about talking about sex had helped keep sexually transmitted infections common in the United States, which has among the highest rates of STDs of any developed country.</p>
<p>The CDC says 13,500 syphilis cases were reported in 2008, an almost 18 percent increase from 2007, with 63 percent of them among men who had sex with men.<br>

		<p>This article only tells part of the story.  Up until the 1970s, because of antibiotics and public awareness campaigns, syphilis was actually on its way out in America.  Thanks in large part to the so-called &#8220;Gay Rights Movement&#8221; that began back then (complete with gay bathhouses), the disease made a comeback.  It started first amongst homosexuals, spreading to bisexuals, spreading to&hellip;you guessed it.</p>
<p>Blacks have now &#8220;picked up the ball&#8221; and ran with it.  An old scourge of mankind that should have been extirpated (like smallpox) is going to go nowhere but up.  Make no mistake about it: as White rule over this country relaxes, venereal diseases like syphilis will engulf it, as they have done in places like sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

		<p>2 Anon: A bacteria is an animal and is subject to the same evolutionary process as any other.  A bacterial infection that kills off its hosts before they can pass it on will die with that host.  Therefore, reproductive success among disease causing bacteria requires that the disease not be so lethal as to deny the bacteria the opportunity to spread.  As it is, AIDS and syphilis take years, even decades to kill someone.  Africa may die of starvation, but not from VD.  </p>

		<p>This is another example of how uncivilized blacks are and how impulsive they act.  Notice the term &#8220;men who have sex with men&#8221;.  Among whites most men are heterosexual with a small percentage born homosexual.  Most sexual relations that white men have fall into one or the other category.  There is little cross-over which is why AIDS was never a large threat to the white community.  Blacks, on the other hand, are so implusive and sexually driven that if one sex isn&rsquo;t available the other will do.  Thus the term &#8220;men who have sex with men&#8221; since these men do not identify as gay or even bisexual.</p>
<p>They not only do not remain loyal to one female for any length of time they find it hard to remain loyal to one sex.  They just want satisfaction right now.</p>

		<p>To 4-Schoolteacher:</p>
<p>Under the three domain taxonomic classification system established in 1991, bacteria (formerly classified as being in the Monera Kingdom) are now classified in the Bacteria Domain, Kingdom Eubacteria.  Animals are classified in the Eukarya Domain, Kingdom Animalia.</p>
<p>That being said, a bacteria that kills off its host doesn&rsquo;t necessarily die with that host.  Some bacteria, like certain members of the genus Clostridium, have evolved the capacity to surround themselves with endospores thus enabling them to survive long periods of time lying dormant in the soil.  Still others, like Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax, can linger in the flesh of a dead host until eaten by either a human or predator, infecting a new host.</p>
<p>AIDS, by the way, is caused by a virus, not a bacterium.  </p>
<p>In the case of bacteria that cause venereal diseases, however, your analysis is probably spot on.</p>

Curiously enough, one reason the Ottoman Empire lost the Balkans was because the Turkish population shrank over the 1800s due to syphilis. With the advent of antibiotics in the early 1900s, the Turkish population started to rise again after World War I.</p>

		<p>To 3-Karl Ketzer:</p>
<p>There, there now.  In all fairness to blacks, if you&rsquo;re going to criticize their behaviors you should quote the most updated science.</p>
<p>The following is a direct quote from the booklet &#8220;Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2008&#8221; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (pgs. 2 &amp; 3).</p>
<p><a href="/std/stats08/surv2008-Complete.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/surv2008-Complete.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Although wide disparities exist in the rates of STDs among racial and ethnic groups, there has been a reduction in these differences for syphilis over the past ten years. The P&S; syphilis rate for 2008 in blacks was eight times the rate in whites, which is substantially lower than the disparity observed in 1999, when the rate among blacks was 29 times greater than that among whites (Table 34B).  </p>
<p>However, since 2003, increases in syphilis among blacks have been higher than increases among whites, reversing some of the gains made in this health disparity. In 2008, increases were observed among both black men (28.0 cases per 100,000 population, up from 22.9 in 2007) and black women (7.6 cases per 100,000 population, up from 5.5 in 2007).&#8221;</p>
<p>Note the WIDE disparity in syphilis transmission rates between black males and females.  I know I don&rsquo;t have to tell anyone here why that exists.  Istvan hit the nail right on the head.  Disgusting!</p>
<p>Some other gems gleaned from this booklet.  I STRONGLY recommend anyone reading this put this URL in their &#8220;favorites&#8221; as well as download this article.  Pass it around.</p>
<p>From page 8 (Chlamydia)</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2008, chlamydia rates increased for all racial and ethnic groups (Figure 6, Table 11B). The rate of chlamydia among blacks was over eight times higher than that of whites (1,519.3 and 173.6 cases per 100,000, respectively).&#8221;</p>
<p>From page 65 (Gonorrhea)</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, the rate of gonorrhea among blacks in the United States was 20 times greater than that among whites. This disparity has changed little in recent years (20 times higher in 2003, 19 times in 2007) (Figure P, Table 21B). This disparity was higher for black men (27.6 times higher) than for black women (16.0 times higher) (Figure Q).&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, note the sizable disparity between black men and women.<br>

		<p>6 Anon: I stand corrected. <br>
     I know that AIDS is a viral disease, but doesn&rsquo;t the same reasoning apply?  If I get HIV tomorrow and die next week, won&rsquo;t the virus die with me, unless it quickly finds a new host?  </p>
