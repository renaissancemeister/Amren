			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Oscar Avila, Los Angeles Times, April 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An individual&rsquo;s responses to census questions are confidential, but one of President Obama&rsquo;s answers on the 10-question form adds more fodder to the ongoing conversation about how America sees itself.</p>
<p>After media inquiries, the White House confirmed that Obama checked only the racial box that says: &#8220;Black, African Am., or Negro,&#8221; the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>Obama could have checked more than one racial box, given that his father was an African from Kenya and his mother was a white woman from Kansas. He could have checked &#8220;white&#8221; as well, or even &#8220;some other race&#8221; and written in &#8220;multiracial.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The news quickly made the rounds among not only political commentators but citizens with mixed racial ancestry. Some second-guessed Obama&rsquo;s choice while others said there are no right or wrong answers to that question.</p>
<p>Michelle Hughes, president of the Chicago Biracial Family Network, said she received several e-mails from surprised friends within moments of Obama&rsquo;s decision being made public.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think everybody is entitled to self-identify. If he chooses to self-identify as African American, that&rsquo;s his right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That being said, I think that the multiracial community feels a sense of disappointment that he refuses to identify with us.</p>

		<p>Most mixed race or &#8216;mulattoes, classify themselves as &#8216;Black&rsquo;.  This is not technically correct.  However, it presents a message to White people.  Not only does miscegenation destroy Whites as a race, but the resulting mixed race individuals do not identify in most cases with the White part of themselves.  It is as if they&rsquo;ve appropriated White genes and applying the positive traits to being Black.  The phrase for this is &#8220;Genetic theft&#8221;.  A robin hood sort of mentality; in other words White woman has Black man&rsquo;s baby, resulting baby grows up and gives no credit to White side of himself.  Any positive traits are immediately credited to the Black side.  Carried on long enough with more and more Whites the end result will be the cessation of the White race.  Blacks will then have White genes and have the capabilities for civilization-building.  If and when that happens, Blacks will blame any problems faced by humanity on the past evilness of the White man - which is basically what they&rsquo;re doing right now, except now they blame past AND present Whites.  The only difference is there won&rsquo;t be any more White people to give a counter-argument.  Everything about us from works of art to great scientific achievements will be credited to Blacks - Unjustly.  (Unjustly to Whites that is)  I hope I didn&rsquo;t get too far ahead there.  Hopefully we can stop this juggernaut before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>It is telling. At one time, mixed race or mulatto individuals, whenever feasible, would go out of their way to identify or &#8220;pass&#8221; as white. In recent decades, of course, the tendency has been turned upside down, and it is far more advantageous in so many ways to identify as black, whether financially, culturally or what have you. Yet still, we hear the endless moaning about the horrors of &#8220;racism&#8221; in everyday America and those with even a drop of black &#8216;blood&rsquo; in them join right in the chorus. It could not be further from reality, and truly shows what total fraud modern society really is.  </p>

		<p>I agree with Awakened (#2) and I&rsquo;ll add that this is further evidence that white women who breed with black men are essentially declaring their own heritage worthless and void while, at the same time, elevating black heritage to the point where it&rsquo;s considered the only one that counts.  I&rsquo;d venture to say that the same even applies to white men who breed with black women - but, in this case, there is no historic precedent for it; the woman generally takes the man&rsquo;s sir name.  In a sense, white women who breed with blacks are reinforcing the same age-old male-centric paradigm that most of them claim to despise.  They subjugate both their race and their gender in one thoughtless, selfish act.  They typically fancy themselves iconoclasts while, in fact, they behave as mindless drones, vacuously obeying, like lemmings, the propaganda that is pumped into their heads.</p>

		<p>Funny, I&rsquo;ve noticed all my life that biracial &#8220;blacks&#8221; are actually MORE self-righteous and hateful than are blacks that are, indeed, mostly black. In fact, in biracial persons, the more white they have in them, the more they try to identify with negritude and the black community. </p>
<p>However, their white DNA apparently holds nothing back from typical black entitlement and opportunism; they&rsquo;re black when it suits them or white when it&rsquo;s convenient. Our so-called &#8220;president&#8221; is a prime example of this. I&rsquo;ve met very few half black/half white individuals that were any different.</p>
<p>That said, though: Blacks, biracials and even quadroons never miss a chance to grieve about racial issues; real or imagined. I imagine that Obama is perfectly aware of this census and identifies with the &#8220;none them want to be white, anyway&#8221; mentality. </p>

		<p>Poster #2, Awakened:  The reason they identify with the black part of themselves is historical - in the South, if a person had a drop of black blood, they were black, no if&rsquo;s and&rsquo;s or but&rsquo;s.  Mark Twain wrote a fascinating story about it, called &#8220;Pudd&rsquo;nhead Wilson.&#8221;  It was about a white guy who was experimenting with fingerprinting people, and he fingerprinted two baby boys, one a VERY light black and the other a pure white.  Well, the black mother switched the infants in their cribs, as she took care of them both - and so the black kid grew up white and vice versa.  It was eventually discovered, and the trauma to each of these now-men was horrific, as the &#8220;white&#8221; man had to be a slave and the former slave had to be white, and it was impossible for either to adjust.  Point being, there is a very strong historical precedent for mixed-race persons to identify with their black blood.</p>

		<p>So by focusing so much on separating every race for celebration, yet while insisting on there being only ONE race (kind of a contradiction, don&rsquo;t you think?) we&rsquo;ve created even one more category of minorities that we must please. It appears that our illlustrious leaders use separation when it benefits them, and integration when it benefits them.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I think everybody is entitled to self-identify.&#8221; So says Ms Hughes&hellip;.. </p>
<p>That being said, I have refused to provide any racial data for the past 18 years. No black, no white, no nothing. I ignore the questions on forms, or check them all just to mess with the data. I am tired of government fencing us into small enclaves of white or latino or whatever. Its my little act of defiance. </p>
<p>As for the census, when asked my race, I checked OTHER and put down HUMAN. Thats how I self Identify Ms Hughes!! I refuse to play the game anymore! </p>

		<p>I might point out to:  7  &mdash;  jewamongyou and 10  &mdash;  DixieProud<br>
that it is the White part of the mixed-race individual that provides the intellectual capabilities for a certain kind of rebellion; I mean, and this might sound crude or maybe just street-smart, I know if I were half-Black and half-White I would be angry at the fact that I wasn&rsquo;t all White.  In other words I would have jealousy toward White people, jealousy that I, me, wasn&rsquo;t All-White.  Did you ever see Eric Holder the Attorney General?  He&rsquo;s got many White features.  He&rsquo;s a mixed-blood if there ever was one.  These are the angriest Blacks, the ones that are only part-White, I believe they hate the fact that they&rsquo;re only part-White and therefore want to hurt Whites in any way that they can simply because they themselves can never be completely White.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Blacks in general have some underlying wish to be White. Wouldn&rsquo;t you if you were them?  I&rsquo;m not trying to sound facetious either.  I believe it to be the case.  Blacks who can get a White woman or girl to date them like to put them on display.  They have some realization, and this may sound racist, but I&rsquo;m sorry, that Whites ARE &#8220;better&#8221; than they.  They prove it themselves in their own behavior.  Except the phenomenon that I wrote of before - &#8220;Genetic Theft&#8221; actually takes from us and gives to Blacks, while they still retain their identity as Blacks.</p>

		<p>I remember reading Obama was disgusted by his mother&rsquo;s jungle fever.  His mother had jungle fever (self hate) and she left him to pursue her own interests (selfish).  What child would want to honor a self hating and selfish mother?  I get the feeling he has shame for her and his life story.  Also mulattos almost never look white so they can&rsquo;t relate to their white family.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s review:</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s black &#8220;father&#8221; abandoned him when he was 2 years old (there&rsquo;s a shock)</p>
<p>Obama was raised by his white mother, Indonesian stepfather and later white grandparents in Indonesia and Hawaii</p>
<p>But he considered himself &#8220;black&#8221;. Quite an insult to the people who raised him.</p>
<p>Of course the Osmond family probably know more black people growing up than Barack did. </p>

		<p>Obama says in his book &#8220;Dreams From My Father&#8221;, &#8220;I ceased to advertise my mothers race at the age of twelve or thirteen, when I began to suspect by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Obama is a good example of why whites should never mix with blacks at all. Period!  No amount of guilt-tripping or PC is going to make whites, for the long term, accept inter-racial relationships or children as being normal and healthy.  The fact a man hates the very people who raised him and got him to where he was when they didn&rsquo;t have to speaks volumes.  Blacks are a selfish, hateful, ungrateful race of losers and whiners.</p>

		<p>&#8220;These are the angriest Blacks, the ones that are only part-White&#8221;  &mdash;    Awakened</p>
<p>I fully agree with Awakened. That has been my observation too. And the whiter they are, the angrier and more bitter they are. (Look at Rev. Wright and Elijah Muhammad as outstanding examples of this.)  These mixed-breeds are also, almost always, the leaders in the black community and of almost any black movement. (Vernon Jordan is the only truly black exception I can offhand think of.) On the other hand, by contrast to these angry mulattoes,  I have known jolly, easy-going, relaxed black folks who were comfortable with their blackness and were not bitter or hateful about anything.  Basically, I&rsquo;d prefer a good-natured black man to an embittered, sullen half-white one. It&rsquo;s the mulattoes who are dangerous.</p>
