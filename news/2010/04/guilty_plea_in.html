<h1>Guilty Plea in Death of UNC Student President</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Baker, Google News, April 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the men accused in the killing of a student body president at University of North Carolina&rsquo;s flagship campus pleaded guilty to federal crimes Monday, avoiding a death penalty case prosecutors were pursuing.</p>
<p>Demario Atwater pleaded guilty to several charges, including carjacking resulting in death and kidnapping. Prosecutors agreed to drop their plan to pursue the death penalty and Atwater agreed that he will face a life sentence.</p>
<p>Eve Carson, 22, of Athens, Ga., was found shot to death in the middle of a Chapel Hill street in March 2008. She had been shot five times, including once in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Atwater is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 23, and he still faces charges in state court along with Laurence Lovette, who was only 17 at the time of the killing and is ineligible for the death penalty.</p>
<p>Authorities believe Atwater and Lovette kidnapped Carson from outside her Chapel Hill home just before 4 a.m., stole her sport utility vehicle and took her to several ATMs, eventually withdrawing $1,400.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. attorney Anna Mills Wagoner said Monday that the plea avoids the uncertainty and pain of a drawn-out trial and endless appeals.</p>
<p>&#8220;A life sentence in the federal criminal justice system means just that: life without the possibility of parole or early release,&#8221; Wagoner said in a statement.</p>
<p>Federal executions are rare. {snip} Executions are even more rare in Orange County, which hasn&rsquo;t returned a death sentence in about 70 years.<br>

		<p>There is a de facto ban on giving any black who murders a white the death penalty.  I cannot think of one instance in the last 10 years in which it has happened.  Those that say life in prison is worse don&rsquo;t understand the black low IQ mindset.  To them jail is only an inconvenience, not punishment.  Add to that fact the very real chance that one or both of these criminal blacks could walk out of prison in fifteen or twenty years.  Don&rsquo;t expect justice from the injustice system we have now.</p>

		<p>Will this beast be doing any productive labor to repay his debt to society and in exchange for his keep, or will his sentence merely consign him to a life of mundane routine that includes eat, sleep, watch TV, and do &#8220;business&#8221; out in the yard?   </p>

&#8220;Eve Carson&rsquo;s murder was a senseless, random act of violence,&#8221; Wagoner said. </p>
<p>One of many inane and feckless statements made in recent press conferences by this Libby Dole/Bush cowardly AUSA holdover that Eric Holder hasn&rsquo;t gotten around to firing yet and no less coming from &#8220;Black Voices&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://conversations.blackvoices.com/entertainment/99435682aaea4564b24369ed6fc90973/21-22-and-rest-of-life-in-prison/2ba5267e3e7643fba42fd36df0752343?sn=21" rel="nofollow">https://conversations.blackvoices.com/entertainment/99435682aaea4564b24369ed6fc90973/21-22-and-rest-of-life-in-prison/2ba5267e3e7643fba42fd36df0752343?sn=21</a></p>
<p>There was absolutely nothing &#8220;senseless and random&#8221; about the cold blooded murder of Eve Carson, the posterchild Kool-Aid swigger of tolerance and multi-culturalism. It all made perfect sense and conformed to the ice cold calculations of a couple of racist predators zeroing in on a defenseless easy target perceived to be (correctly) affluent, white, female, with a high balance/credit limit ATM card, and a set of keys to a fine ride.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s keep track of the trend.</p>
<p>High profile murders of Whites by the afrovoodoo Diversity result in life sentences only and not death penalties, which serves to perpetuate the stereotype that Whites can be killed without  afrovoodoo  killers&rsquo; worrying about the ultimate consequence.  This tactic in the War of Races only serves to devalue the lives of Whites and embolden the Diversity to do more robbing, raping, and murdering.</p>
<p>The subtle message to Whites is that their lives are worth less than blacks, and they shouldn&rsquo;t complain while being robbed, raped, and murdered by the blacks, because if being robbed, raped, and murdered by a black was truly an injustice, then the blacks would have been given the death penalty.  They weren&rsquo;t, so you and your White Race Skin must not be as valuable to society as you think.  </p>
<p>Giving capital offence afrovoodoos life only for murdering Whites is a weapon of justice against unearned White privilege. </p>
<p>Devaluing Whites makes their privileges less secure.</p>
<p>White Eve Carson, White Channon Christian, White Anne Pressley were all killed by blacks and none of their killers got the death penalty, only life. That&rsquo;s a judicial trend.</p>
<p>What does it take to get the death penalty these days if you are an afro diversity and kill a White American Citizen?</p>
<p>As a parent, why do I fear that a N-stereotype can rob, rape, and murder my beautiful blonde daughter and then live out his natural life span under the care and protection of the federal government while my taxes pay for his privilege of not being loose on the streets where I can find him?  </p>
<p>There was a time when our People would not have stood for this injustice. Jim Crow had its good points and times like these remind us how to revere the memory of racial segregation and apartheid.</p>

<p>Truly. The poor misguided Carsons who naively raised their beautiful daughter to be a victim now join the ranks of the Christians, Newsomes, Pressleys, the families of the Wichita victims et al ad infinitum for the endless nights of thinking about the last horrific moments of their innocent loved ones and of the beasts who are living out their worthless lives in prison while eating three meals a day, getting health care, recreation and perhaps conjugal visits all of which are being subsidised by their taxes. The most hurtful part is that those life sentences will never be served.</p>
<p>I remember the interview with Channon Christian&rsquo;s dad who spoke of the terrible rage that he had in his heart. His voice cracked when he spoke of his little girl. I imagined myself in his place and didn&rsquo;t sleep that night. THe rest of my life would be dedicated to getting those puta madres. On the day of their release and believe me that day WILL come, I&rsquo;d be waiting there and I&rsquo;d get to them even if it meant my death at the hands of the police.<br>

		<p>The fact that Atwater pleaded guilty means that the right to appeal his conviction on some absurd technicality is gone like a puff of smoke.  He can later appeal the sentence, but that&rsquo;s it, and I doubt he&rsquo;ll get any traction there, due to the circumstances attendant on the crime.</p>
<p>Since someone mentioned conjugal visits, I think it is fair to point out that this was federal court where he pleaded guilty, and there are no conjugal visits in the BOP.</p>
<p>No; he won&rsquo;t be executed, but he&rsquo;s also not getting out.</p>

<p>There was a time when our People would not have stood for this injustice. Jim Crow had its good points and times like these remind us how to revere the memory of racial segregation and apartheid.</p>
<p>I blame Eric Dyson and Cornell West and Leondard Pitts and Cynthia Tucker for the failures of their race.  Time they spent complaining about White People could have been spent in outreach to the black community teaching &#8220;their people&#8221; how to stay in school, read books, not get pregnant, get married, stay married, stay out of jail, etc.  These &#8220;African American&#8221; leaders didn&rsquo;t do any of that, Whites were killed, and to these blacks goes the blame.  We are under no obligation to them whatsoever. The time has come for the black race to prove to the White Race that they can take care of themselves.</p>
<p>We want Eve Carson back, and if they can&rsquo;t give her back to  us, then we owe them nothing, and nothing is what they shall have from us in abundance.</p>
<p><br>
We must hold the Civil Rights Community accountable for the failures of their &#8220;communities of color&#8221; at disproving all the dire warnings of those vile and evil antebellum racists who accurately predicted our current horrors and plight.</p>

		<p>One of the killers of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom did get the death penalty, but only one. Lemaricus Davidson, the ringleader of the gang, received a death sentence last November. Two others were given &#8220;life without parole.&#8221; The trial of the female suspect takes place next month. </p>
<p>Yes, it was unusual. Knox County had not handed down a death sentence since 1997.</p>
