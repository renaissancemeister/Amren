			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katie Drummond, AOL News, April 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Geological Survey is blaming day-to-day seismological changes for Sunday&rsquo;s 7.2 earthquake along the U.S.-Mexico border. But Deepak Chopra, the famed alternative-medicine practitioner and transcendental meditation guru, is pretty sure he knows what really happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had a powerful meditation just now  &mdash;  caused an earthquake in Southern California,&#8221; Chopra wrote to his nearly 179,000 Twitter followers shortly after the quake.</p>
<p>And then, to clarify: &#8220;Was meditating on Shiva mantra &amp; earth began to shake,&#8221; he tweeted. &#8220;Sorry about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deepak Chopra, here in San Jose, Calif., sent messages on Sunday to his thousands of Twitter followers apologizing for causing an earthquake in Southern California with powerful meditation.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hindu transcendental meditation guru thinks he and Shiva are to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s not the reason, then it is due to white racism and oppression. <br>

		<p>Deepak Chopra is a clown and the jokes on the saps (mostly White) that buy his books, CDs, and DVDs. <br>
The guy has made millions off of the gullibility and the spiritual emptiness of the Western sheep. </p>
<p>One of the many examples of how American education has failed to transmit the glories of our own cultural traditions for two generations. The sheeple, not knowing anything of Western Civilization, seek to associate with the &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; cultures of Asia, Africa, or Native America. </p>
<p>Chopra reminds me of the Indian Guru that died a while back (80s or 90s). He promoted himself as a living god and his thousands of followers kept his body on ice in the Indian heat waiting for him to resurrect. As the body started to turn black around the extremities, the most fanatical actually drank the melting icewater!! Finally the Indian army had to storm the leaders tents and dispose of the body. </p>

		<p>Due to work I have become acquainted with many Indians. They are very superstitious. Past lives, the will of God, fate, and fortune telling are just part of what I&rsquo;ve heard. As basically an agnostic or at best partly lapsed Catholic I have had to roll my eyes more than once listening to such talk. There&rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with this, just diversity at work. <br>
I&rsquo;d like to point out white people&rsquo;s lacking in regard to the immigration scheme and modern 2010 realities. We like to sneer and laugh at these others-make fun of an Indian accent, etc. but they are for the most part having the last laugh. They wield a lot of power  where I work and not at all based on work done well (some are very competent but many are lazy and incompetent yet many of the latter move up the chain because they stick together and whitey doesn&rsquo;t and at any rate Dieversity is the Law now). I believe Indian Americans are the wealthiest ethnic group in the Us. They dominate many key small business fields-hotel/motel, cigar/newspaper, and gas station. I heard grumbling on the commute home the other day by two white guys complaining how they unfairly dominate the IT field in which they work. Many I encounter can barely communicate in English yet thrive. <br>
So poking fun at their superstition really can&rsquo;t get us far. Taking their example of sticking together as a people would be a much more productive endeavor. </p>

<p>A few years ago, I read an article, I think it was in the University of Missouri Law Review, that outlined how a lot of these Indians get away with bank and other kinds of illegal fraud in owning all these American hotels and motels.  Key to the scam is &#8220;Patel&#8221; or some variant being the surname in India that means innkeeper.  </p>

		<p>This is a story I definetly have to comment on. I have often had conversations with a few buddies of mine, on the topic of Deepak Chopra and his books, and other activities. He got rich preaching and writing the Eastern Meditation stuff, through seminars and mail order courses, as well as a retreat in San Diego, California, that, in my opinion, rich women and men with to much time on their hands go to. It costs thousands of dollars to hear the &#8220;Doctors&#8221; healing advice.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve always wondered about is, why doesn&rsquo;t he return to India, and meditate by the Ganges River, to clean it up, or on the sidewalks of Calcutta and other cities in poverty stricken India, in order to help the sick and handicapped people there. This is where his powers are really needed. Don&rsquo;t be looking for him to go there soon. As a buddy of mine used to say, &#8220;they take all denominations, but prefer twenties and hundreds.&#8221;</p>
<p>P.S. I don&rsquo;t mean to offend any Indians who consider the Ganges holy, etc., but I&rsquo;m mainly commenting on Chopra, whom yes, I consider a &#8220;classic con man&#8221;, in the best tradition that implies. If you listen to the guy for just a few minutes, it becomes apparent how utterly full of himself he is.</p>

		<p>This is megalomania at its finest. I suppose he gave up traditional medicine because he found it more lucrative to ply so much New Age nonsense while enjoying the attention and material trappings of a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; guru.  So when this cash cow passed some gas, did that induce the Haiti earthquake?</p>

		<p>My guess is that Deepak Chopra was joking - he&rsquo;s a well-educated man, both in medicine and in Scriptures, and he has a good sense of humor.  I have studied the various systems of spirituality my whole life, and I&rsquo;m 65 now   &mdash;   and the Hindu system is by far the deepest and most profound of them all.  Chopra is no amateur, like most of the people judging him.  On the other hand, it is known by the rishis (the ancients who provided us with the Hindu texts that defy intellectual comprehension) that earth events do result from the composite thought energy of all souls   &mdash;   so it may be that Chopra was simply reminding us all that each of us is important to the God we love; &#8220;not a sparrow falls to earth without His knowledge.&#8221;  You and I both count - it DOES matter what we think and say.</p>

<p>Because the Ganges is a very dirty river he won&rsquo;t go there, he won&rsquo;t go to Calcutta because it is full of sick, handicapped but mostly POOR people which, of course, do not fit in with his scheme of getting richer.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s remember this the next time someone tries to sell us on NAMESAns (North African, Middle Eastern, South Asians) as fellow &#8220;Caucasians&#8221; or on Indians as &#8220;Aryans&#8221;.  Some, such as &#8220;Savitri Devi&#8221; even embraced Hinduism.  Madness.</p>

<p>Your comments reminded me of an article I read on VDare some years ago. It started out something like, &#8220;Have you ever wondered why all the convenience store owners are named Patel?&#8221;<br>
It went on to talk about the SBA scam that is giving out loans basically to any foreigner that has a pulse. If they don&rsquo;t speak English there are plenty of &#8220;advocacy&#8221; groups out there that will do the paperwork for them and write up a business plan. </p>

		<p>#10 Varina, right you are. Rather than constantly thinking about the Grand Plans white people need to take into consideration in order to &#8220;save&#8221; themselves, thinking about how many scams any immigrant who comes to the U.S. yesterday might be of more use. Many of these scams, as Varina points out, are enriching these newly minted &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, and impoverishing the European founding stock that has to support the scams. As always, the devil is in the details where the solution to so many problems are concerned. Unfortunately, most Eurpean Americans don&rsquo;t care about the very details that are helping to ruin them and their nation.</p>
