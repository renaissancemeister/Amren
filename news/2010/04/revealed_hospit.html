			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophie Borland, Daily Mail (London), April 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An NHS hospital has staff from a staggering 70 countries on its payroll.</p>
<p>The huge number of overseas nurses, cleaners and porters has forced health chiefs to send them on ten-week English courses because many do not understand basic medical phrases.</p>
<p>Among the terms some workers from countries such as Burma, the Philippines and Poland can&rsquo;t follow are &#8216;nil by mouth&rsquo;, &#8216;doing the rounds&rsquo; and &#8216;bleeping a doctor&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They highlight the language problems throughout the Health Service, which critics say are putting patients&rsquo; lives at risk.</p>
<p>The lessons follow several &#8216;near-disaster&rsquo; cases, including one where a meal was delivered to a patient because a member of staff did not understand that &#8216;nil by mouth&rsquo; meant the man could not eat or drink.</p>
<p>Although all doctors from outside the EU must pass an English language test set by the General Medical Council before they can practise, the same rules do not apply for other hospital workers.</p>
<p>Instead, they are usually assessed on their grasp of the language at interview.</p>
<p>The problem has become so acute at Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals that foreign workers are being encouraged to attend ten-week, taxpayer-funded &#8216;English For Speakers Of Other Languages&rsquo; courses, which are run by a nearby college.</p>
<p>Research has found that up to a quarter of nurses  &mdash;  more than 60,000  &mdash;  working in London are foreign, with the largest number coming from the Philippines.</p>
<p>Hospitals in the capital that recruit a high number of overseas workers include University College Hospital, the Royal Free, and Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Manchester Royal Infirmary also has a high proportion of foreign staff from countries including India, Ghana, Spain, Germany, Iceland and the Yemen.</p>
<p>Jacquie Pearce-Gervis, of the Oxford Radcliffe Patients&rsquo; Forum, called last night for English lessons to be made compulsory rather than voluntary.</p>
<p>&#8216;Patients and relatives have been calling for this for a long time,&rsquo; she added. &#8216;The language barrier can be a real issue. The most common problem is &#8220;nil by mouth&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;There have been cases when porters have delivered a patient food despite the fact there is a clear sign on their bed saying &#8220;nil by mouth&#8221;. Obviously this could have led to disaster but fortunately the patient has been intelligent enough to point out that they are not allowed the food.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think it should be compulsory. There can often be problems with common slang terms used on the ward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A member of staff at the trust, who did not wish to be named, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s a real problem here and the language lessons can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have so many foreign employees here and it&rsquo;s very worrying if they don&rsquo;t speak English.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There have been increasing concerns over the language skills of overseas medical staff since the death of David Gray, who was unlawfully killed by a foreign out-of-hours doctor in 2008.</p>
<p>The 70-year-old died after Dr Daniel Ubani, 67, a German GP whose English was so poor that he had been rejected by other health authorities, gave him a massive overdose of painkillers.</p>
<p>It was later revealed that although Dr Ubani had already failed an English language test in Leeds, he was still allowed to sit a different trust&rsquo;s less-stringent test.</p>
<p>Last night, Mr Gray&rsquo;s relatives called on the Government to take a tougher stance on NHS staff who could not speak English.</p>
<p>His son Dr Stuart Gray, 49, a GP based in Belbroughton, West Midlands, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s an appalling state of affairs. It is paramount that all NHS staff should be able to speak English. Our father died at the hands of a doctor who had in fact taken an English test and failed it.</p>
<p>&#8216;But the GMC and the Government are unable to enforce any rules on doctors recruited from within the EU. As a result they are having to rely on Primary Care Trusts to enforce their own testing system which  &mdash;  as the tragedy with Dr Ubani demonstrates  &mdash;  isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>&#8216;All NHS staff  &mdash;  be it doctors, nurses or other workers  &mdash;  must be able to speak English.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rainy Faisey, deputy director of human resources at Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals, said the courses were a way of giving staff in lower-paid jobs a chance to develop their skills.</p>
<p>&#8216;As an employer, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust offers a wide variety of training and development opportunities to its staff to help them to provide excellent care for our patients and further their career in the NHS,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Like all good employers we give all staff the opportunity to develop their reading, writing and numeracy skills, whether their first language is English or not.&rsquo;<br>

<p>I suspect this Dr. is NOT German but Kenyan or Nigerian. Daniel is a popular name in those countries and Urbani is certainly NOT German, or at least no German name I have EVER heard. There is criticism of the Filipinas here too, though in my experiences with Phhilipine people, I have only ever met 2 that did not speak English fairly well. I believe close examination would reveal the problems are with Africans, Pakistanis and Indians&hellip;those nationalities that are running England into 4th world status. Englanistan does love it&rsquo;s muslim Pakistannis.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an important lesson as to how this happened. Their socialized medicine increased demands while using the monopolistic power of government to dictate costs. The result was to force local healthcare workers (ie doctors, nurses, etc) out of the profession. The short-fall was then made up by importing health-care workers from the 3rd world.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s English?  Who would&rsquo;ve guessed?  I&rsquo;ve been speaking English all my life, and I wouldn&rsquo;t understand it either!</p>
<p>Better sign me up for the remedial course.</p>
<p>PS. I agree with Schoolteacher that Dr. Urbani sounds like a strange sort of &#8220;German&#8221;.  Sure he is!  I&rsquo;ll bet!</p>

		<p>Hmmm, the name &#8220;Urbani&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t sound at all German????? How about they start hiring only English doctors,nurses and such. THAT would solve the problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just don&rsquo;t see how a &ldquo;German&rdquo; doctor could even get through gymnasium (German academic high school) without learning English.&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, the quality of the German school system has deteriorated a lot since the 1960s. I can personally testify to that. Some of my former fellow students were enrolled in advanced English courses and are still barely capable of speaking a smattering.<br>
Besides, how can you expect a non-citizen of the UK to grasped British colloquialisms like &#8220;nil to mouth&#8221;? &#8220;Gut rot&#8221; is another example for one of those slang expressions frequently encountered in the medical field and it took me quite long to figure out the meaning, although I consider myself fairly proficient. Instead of making ample use of vernacular phrases that are not self-explanatory like &#8220;nil to mouth&#8221;, one could simply say &#8220;patient is not allowed to eat or drink&#8221; or &#8220;no oral ingestion&#8221;, it`s hardly more cumbersome.<br>
Anyways, is there such a lack of British willing to opt for a career in medicine?</p>

		<p>If these third-world hospital workers were so competent whites would travel in droves to third-world countries to receive superior medical treatment.  </p>
<p>Hospitals hire the cheapest workers they can find and they don&rsquo;t care one bit about how many patients die at the hands of these third-world imposters.  </p>
<p>Government run health care makes it impossible for patients to levy malpractice suits against imported second-rate medical staff and the hospital execs who hire them&hellip;    </p>

		<p>&#8220;Urbani&#8221;.. sounds like a Middle-east transplant to the EU who gained German citizenship in order to get to Britain.  In any case, given the current immigration policy, Britain, Germany and the whole of the EU countries are in a suicide race with the U.S.</p>

		<p>Is it really too much to expect a British hospital to use &#8220;Nothing by mouth&#8221; instead of this pretentious Latinism &#8220;Nil&#8221;?</p>
<p>By the way, educated Germans who were educated in the former East Germany often do not speak English.</p>

<p>Phrases such as &#8220;nil by mouth&#8221; are common in the medical field. In the U.S. it&rsquo;s NPO. Can you imagine a doctor having to write on a chart &ldquo;patient is not allowed to eat or drink&rdquo; or &ldquo;no oral ingestion&rdquo; 20 times or more a day? How about, one tab &#8220;four times a day&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;qid&#8221;? </p>
<p>Most of these medical abbreviations have Greek or Latin roots and so they shouldn&rsquo;t be that unfamiliar to anyone with medical training. If you&rsquo;re going to practice in a foreign country you need to make sure you&rsquo;re familiar with all the medical abbreviations used in that country. It&rsquo;s very easy. Just go out and buy yourself a book on medical abbreviations in the language of that country. If these so called foreign medical personnel are so stupid they can&rsquo;t figure that out, they&rsquo;d be better employed as street sweepers or something.  <br>

		<p>While out of work in 2005 I gained temporary employment working as a Porter in a large hospital near London. I was horrified by what I saw.</p>
<p>Foreign nurses were common place many were unable to speak English clearly enough to tell what they wanted from stores, some were unable to write it down so I could read it. </p>
<p>A locum sister (yep white) walked out after one night due to the many foreign staff being in IHO incompetent, she submitted a complaint in writing.</p>
<p>This complaint resulted in senior Dr coming down to find out what happened, the foreign nurse started screaming (yes screaming) about racism. Complaint over, Dr walked away, problem unresolved but left the nurse concerned grinning ear to ear.</p>
<p>English nurses (aka white) would give a much higher standard of care often holding patients hands while I took them to the operating rooms, I never ever saw this with foreign nurses.</p>

		<p>I am not in any way putting Britain down ( I have almost 100% British ancestory), but is there any profession in that country other than politics that has not been taken over by immigrants? I have seen British posters come on here before and claim that it is really hard to find a white doctor in Britain now, and that most of them are from India.  And then there is that other article that was put up right below this one that goes into how Indian students are doing better in school than white students.  I find that completely unacceptable.  I understand that America has the exact same problems, but it just seems to me that Britain has the same problems America does except to the nth degree.  What is going on over there?  I am tired of hearing about Third World immigrants running most of everything over there.</p>

<p>More likely that the locals couldn&rsquo;t stand the heavy demands, probable harrasment, and low pay from the NHS. Very likely coming to a neighborhood near you in the good ol&rsquo; USA.</p>
