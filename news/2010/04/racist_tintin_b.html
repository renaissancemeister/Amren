<h1>&#8216;Racist&rsquo; Tintin Book Faces Ban in Belgium</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Williams, Sky News (Isleworth, Middlesex), April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eighty years after it first went to print, a Tintin comic could be stripped from shops in his home country of Belgium.</p>
<p>Judges are set to rule whether to remove the story of the intrepid explorer&rsquo;s first African adventure after a Congolese man claimed it is racist.</p>
<p>Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo wants Tintin in the Congo  &mdash;  the second in the celebrated children&rsquo;s series  &mdash;  to be axed for its ignorant depiction of native Africans.</p>
<p>Creator Herg√© defended his book, first published in 1930, in later life and said any stereotypes merely reflected contemporary colonialist views.</p>
<p>The Belgian courts may follow a recent compromise decision in Britain and place a sticker warning of offensive content instead.</p>
<p>That was the result when the UK&rsquo;s Commission for Racial Equality called for the comic to be banned in 2007.</p>
<p>Mr Mondondo has put his case to Belgian and French judges before, but his latest legal challenge faces some scepticism.</p>
<p>Online comic magazine actubd.com accused him of lying about his profession, amid other doubts that he will be unable to pay his own lawyers.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many White people are offended by the comic characters Popeye and Wimpy.  Then there&rsquo;s the insulting model that Popeye&rsquo;s girlfriend, Olive Oyl, projects.  Oh, the sadness and shame of it all! The vicious cartoonist who invented these characters should be publicly chastized and banished to poverty! </p>

		<p>Tintin comics are one of my fondest childhood memories. If you have children I strongly encourage you to look into buying some for your kids. They are well written and superbly illustrated. They are a far cry from the dumb and vaguely homoerotic &#8220;superhero&#8221; comics.</p>

		<p>Hark hark the dogs do bark, do I see some correlation twixt this and the Idris Elba movie? Is one not just as ludicrus as the other. Though so far it seems not, since as I am posting at this time it says no comments. It seems everyone is far more upset over the latter cartoon. Let us have a moment of silence for all the cartoon lovers whose heroes have been mocked. Perhaps we can all get back to the real world problems, once we iron out the make believe ones. Is it any wonder we are such a screwed up country, since we are so far removed from reality?</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t see that the caricatures of the black Congolese are any more insulting than the depictions of the various european characters.Tintin is a rather weedy adolescent with a silly tuft of red hair,and professor Calculus makes Danny de Vito look like Clint Eastwood.The two bowler-hatted buffoons,Dupont et Dupont(In America they have been anglicised into the Thompson Twins)are the embodiment of petty bourgeoise drearyness and hardly strike an heroic pose. I sincerely hope that the Belgian authorities treat this man&rsquo;s risible challenge with the contempt it deserves.</p>

<p>This is a <i>Belgian</i>?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pathetic than any White nation would take this arrant PC nonsense seriously in the first place.  But Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo, though he may <i>live</i> in Belgium, is no more Belgian than I am.<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>This is really nothing compared so some old Walt Disney comic books. I still remember one I had as a kid   &mdash;   about Uncle Scrooze and De Wile Woman from Borneo.  (I&rsquo;ll let you guess who she was.)</p>
<p>Uncle Scrooge Tames the Wild Woman:  She escaped from her cage in a carnval where she was featured as the Wild Woman of Borneo.  She had been on a binge and was so ferocious that she had everyone terrified.  But Uncle Scrooge spotted the truth as to where she was really from, and knew how to tame her. </p>
<p>After many years, I can still remember the words (more or less).<br>
Fearlessly approaching the the snarling, foaming Wild Woman, and putting his best Southern drawl,  he said.. &#8220;Say dere, Wile Woman, what you be doing dere, chile?  Lawdy girl, ain&rsquo;t you got no better manners than be bitin&rsquo; at peoples?  Ah&rsquo;m sure yo wasn&rsquo;t raised by yo manny like dat.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she, awestruck that he spoke her dialect, exclaimed,  &#8220;Well, shut ma mouf!  If it ain&rsquo;t a gennilman from de Souf!&#8221; <br>
Right away, they became the best of friends,  and she calmed right down and went back in her cage.   </p>
<p>When I was about nine, I was enchanted by that story; and I didn&rsquo;t see anything &#8220;racist&#8221; about it. I never even heard the term &#8220;racist&#8221; and didn&rsquo;t know what it was. Obviously, neither did Disney.  But back then, white children weren&rsquo;t being constantly scolded about the sins of their race and admonished to be more &#8220;sensitive&#8221; to minorities.   In other words, minorities hadn&rsquo;t been deified yet.</p>
<p>But that was another world.</p>
<p>Did anyone else have that comic?  I&rsquo;m sure there must be others out there.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;If the laws are to be trampled upon with impunity, and a minority is to dictate to the majority, there is an end put, at one stroke, to republican government.&rdquo; - George Washington, 1794.</p>
<p>That one man (who&rsquo;s not even a native) could seriously threaten the existence of a cultural icon shows how utterly effete that country has become.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the result when the UK&rsquo;s Commission for Racial Equality called for the comic to be banned in 2007.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Commission for Racial Equality&rsquo;  Ooooooooh!  There&rsquo;s something so wonderfully Orwellian about that name!</p>

		<p>I am a HUGE fan of Tintin. Absolutely love him. There&rsquo;s an error in Wulfstan&rsquo;s comment though, the publishers who changed the names to Thompson Twins are BRITISH. Not AMERICAN.  The translations are UK products.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Native American and had no beef with Tintin in America  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s a parody. Just like Congo is.  There&rsquo;s a LOT of parody in these books.  If people don&rsquo;t get that, they don&rsquo;t have to read them. </p>

Exactly!   It&rsquo;s only a comic, for goodness&rsquo; sake   &mdash;  - it&rsquo;s SUPPOSED to humorous.  It isn&rsquo;t meant to be a historical documentary.  Can&rsquo;t these touchy Aficans understand that? There&rsquo;s spoofing of white people too, but we&rsquo;re not protesting and demanding that it be banned.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the Ministry of Truth will hunt down all copies of Tintin comics, rewrite and redraw them in accordance with the principles of Newspeak, and then issue them to goodthinkers everywhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Belgian kids late at night will sneak out their tattered copies of the original books and read them under the blankets via flashlight. </p>
