<h1>Black or Biracial? Census Forces a Choice for Some</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Buffalo News, April 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Friday was the deadline to mail 2010 census forms. Although the results are expected to show an increase in the number of multiracial people, some African-Americans with one white parent are deciding to simply &#8220;stay black.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is only the second census to allow people to identify themselves by more than one race. About 7 million people, or 2.4 percent of the U.S. population, chose that option in 2000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to know how many of the 35 million people counted as &#8220;black alone&#8221; in 2000 have a white parent. But it&rsquo;s clear that the decision to check one box  &mdash;  or more  &mdash;  on the census is often steeped in history, culture, pride and mentality.</p>
<p>Exhibit A is President Barack Obama. He declined to check the box for &#8220;white&#8221; on his census form, despite his mother&rsquo;s well-known whiteness.</p>
<p>Obama offered no explanation, but Leila McDowell has an idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put a hoodie on him and have him walk down an alley, and see how biracial he is then,&#8221; said McDowell, vice president of communications for the NAACP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being black in this country is a political construct,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Even though my father is white and I have half his genes, when I apply for a loan, when I walk into the car lot, when I apply for a job, they don&rsquo;t see me as half white, they see me as black. If you have any identifying characteristics, you&rsquo;re black.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is evidence, though, that while some may be resistant to the idea of identifying as multiracial, white attitudes are moving in that direction. In a January poll by the Pew Research Center, 53 percent of white people said Obama is &#8220;mixed race&#8221; and 24 percent said he is black. In contrast, 55 percent of black people said Obama is black and 34 percent said he is mixed.</p>
<p>This also may represent a new twist on the &#8220;one drop&#8221; concept, which for centuries held that even one black ancestor made a person black. Now a brown-skinned man is president, and for many white people, one white parent means you are NOT black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most experts say there is very little genetic difference between people of different races  &mdash;  as little as 1 percent. &#8220;Race is a social concept, not a scientific one,&#8221; goes a much-repeated quote from J. Craig Venter, who led one of the first projects to decipher the entire human genome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one reason why the American racial system is &#8220;facing taxonomical meltdown,&#8221; said Nell Painter, a Princeton University history professor and author of &#8220;The History of White People.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The complications of the classification system, the resistance that people are mounting, the weight of immigration and marriage mixing, young people are checking more than one box,&#8221; Painter said. &#8220;The system might just all fall away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which would leave blackness to be defined person by person, according to how they think, the way they look at the world  &mdash;  blackness as a state of mind.</p>

<p>There is nothing with a biracial person deciding one race or the other. It is not a rejection of other people or races. In fact, I have a number of frieds of all races. My parents encouraged me to be opened minded and accepting of others. </p>

		<p> What a bunch of multi-culti claptrap! Scientists can swear on a stack of Korans that there&rsquo;s &#8220;no such thing as race&#8221;   &mdash;   that our genetic makeup across the spectrum is &#8220;less than 1 percent different&#8221;   &mdash;   but I don&rsquo;t believe it for a New York second. They&rsquo;re saying that because they believe in mixing the races all up, to the maximum degree possible, in the Western world, until you can&rsquo;t tell who is what, and the White race has disappeared altogether.</p>
<p> Race is not a &#8220;social construct.&#8221; If it was, then Whites, blacks, and Asians would look like we were all the same race   &mdash;   and we don&rsquo;t. These people who are half White   &mdash;   nearly always the mother&rsquo;s half   &mdash;   want to call themselves &#8220;black&#8221; because that&rsquo;s the &#8220;cool&#8221; thing to be. &#8220;Ain&rsquo;t cool to be White, man!&#8221; But I&rsquo;ve noticed people that are a White-black mixture seldom look like a White person with a deep tan; they usually look like a black who is a quart low.</p>

<p>We share 96-98% of our dna with chimpanzees, so it&rsquo;s apparent just how much 1% of difference in genetic coding will do.  Or are we pretending that being a chimpanzee is simply a &#8216;social construct&rsquo; now and that they&rsquo;re people just like you or I, albeit with a bit more body hair and an unhealthy obsession with bananas.</p>

		<p>Typical MSM article riddled with falsehoods and misleading statements.</p>
<p><i>Exhibit A is President Barack Obama. He declined to check the box for &ldquo;white&rdquo; on his census form, despite his mother&rsquo;s well-known whiteness.</i></p>
<p>This writer is seemingly totally ignorant of the real controversy. As reported on this site, the bi-racial community was upset that Obama checked the box for &#8220;black&#8221; rather than bi-racial. The writer has it backwards.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Put a hoodie on him and have him walk down an alley, and see how biracial he is then,&rdquo; said McDowell, vice president of communications for the NAACP.</i></p>
<p>She sounds resentful, but who is it that demands such a strict classification in this country? It&rsquo;s the blacks, not the whites. They want to expand their power base by counting everyone they can as &#8220;black.&#8221; If McDowell doesn&rsquo;t like it, she should move to Brazil, where they have many racial classifications.</p>
<p><i>Now a brown-skinned man is president, and for many white people, one white parent means you are NOT black.</i></p>
<p>A total lie. It&rsquo;s the blacks that are not going to be satisfied with Obama. They&rsquo;re going to want a blacker and blacker man in the Oval Office. History will record the blacks in this country as having come to regard Obama as &#8220;not authentically black.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Most experts say there is very little genetic difference between people of different races &mdash; as little as 1 percent. &ldquo;Race is a social concept, not a scientific one,&rdquo; goes a much-repeated quote from J. Craig Venter, who led one of the first projects to decipher the entire human genome.</i></p>
<p>This is why I think the human genome project is not going to uncover the liberal myths about race. Uncomfortable findings will just be covered up. Here we have a silly quote from somebody who was involved with the project with the implication that this was an official finding of the project, which it most decidedly was not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s as little as 1% genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees. What of it?</p>

		<p>The vast majority of U.S. blacks have some white (and often Native) ancestry.  Thus, I find the term &#8220;biracial&#8221; to be silly.  If someone looks like he has African heritage, he will be treated like he&rsquo;s black.  And, of course, the press loves to point out that successful politicians are black, when some  &mdash;  like Bill White of Texas  &mdash;  look like they might be 1/32% at the most.</p>

		<p>race is a biological category like sex.</p>
<p>racial identity is a cultural and psychological category, like gender.</p>
<p>my father is Jewish, my mother - who raised me single-handedly - is Catholic/Protestant.</p>
<p>if I were to identify myself as purely Jewish, I would be insulting my mother and all of her English, Dutch, Irish, and Italian ancestors.</p>
<p>this is what Obama has done, and it is shameful.</p>
<p>cutting through all the politically correct blabber jabber for a moment:</p>
<p>mixed race individuals like Obama benefit from racial quotas designed to help blacks.</p>
<p>most of the blacks who qualified are, like Obama, middle-class mixed race individuals who also benefit from having 50% or more Caucasian genetic material.</p>
<p>most real blacks cannot qualify to go to Harvard - with or without affirmative action as, because blacks (not mixed-race people who identify themselves as African-Americans, but individuals whose genetic material is exclusively or virtually exclusively African) almost never have the intellectual capabilities to attend a top university.</p>
<p>it is not exactly a secret (just open your eyes!!!!) that the African-American elite consists of individuals who are predominantly Caucasian genetically, and they are the ones who really benefit from race quotas designed to help black people.</p>
<p>it is a scandal, a fraud, and a shell game.</p>
<p>most real blacks are left behind.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s OK with mixed race charlatans like Obama, because identifying yourself of African-American is  a good business move in the USA.</p>

I culturally identify with White people, which my &#8220;diversity&#8221;-loving White friends disapprove of.</p>
<p>However, it would be just as inaccurate for me to call myself Black as it would be to call myself White. I always check &#8220;two or more races&#8221; or &#8220;other&#8221;. I was surprised that most Mulattoes identify as Black, but if they made up a larger amount of the population (such as in Haiti&rsquo;s history) it would be apparent that we are a distinct race. That being said, I wouldn&rsquo;t wish it on anybody to feel as though you have no true cultural identity, to be different from both sides of your family.</p>

<p>According  to  genetic  tests(Haplogroup and  MtDNA) approximately 30% of  U.S. blacks show genetic  evidence  of European  ancestry(Haplogroup R and I especially).  On average  U.S.  blacks are  87%  African  in terms  of  genome and  carry  negligible Native  American  genes.</p>
<p>Given  too  that  the  European genome  is  already  30%  African  in genome structure(Cavalli Sforza), then  people  like  Barack  Obamawould  be  predominantly  African  in genome  structure. It  is  the  African ancestry  in  the  European  that  explains  why  the &#8220;biracial&#8221;  offspring  of  blacks  and  white  often  &mdash;  to  use  colloquial  parlance  &mdash;  look  more  African than  European.  In  Africa Obama  could easily  blend into  a  Tuareg,  Moroccan or  Egyptian  crowd.  In Europe  he  would  always  be easily  spotted.</p>

<p>I think there may be a political dimension to this too. People who are of the same racial combination but who are more marxist in outlook will slant more toward the minority race, but who are more conservative will slant more toward white. Anne here is a case in point; she identifies as biracial, whereas Obama identifies as solely black.</p>
<p>Another great example is white Americans with a small fraction of Amerindian background, of whom there are millions. If they&rsquo;re conservative, they&rsquo;re more likely to say they&rsquo;re only white, that the Amerindian is small enough not to matter (and at any rate declaring Amerindian ancestry would only harm themselves and their friends by worsening affirmative action for Amerindians); but liberals will check both boxes or even say they&rsquo;re Amerindian only. This has led to the absurd situation where Amerindians are shown as having a lower fertility rate than non-Hispanic whites in CDC statistics; these liberal mostly-whites who check &#8220;Amerindian&#8221; tend not to be very fecund.</p>

<p>Oh really?!     </p>
<p>That pseudo-scientific quote from Mr. Venter about race being a social concept gets repeated over and over again because it fits with the political agenda of those that who want to only blame the environment as the reason why there are group disparities in income, education, welfare use, illegitimacy, crime, et cetera. But a quote from James Watson, a man of far greater scientific prominence than Venter who not only co-discovered the structure of DNA but was the first head of the Human Genome Project rarely gets any airtime. In his last book, this is what the Nobel prize winning geneticist ahd to say- &#8220;There is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically. Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Haha. I&rsquo;m American of English, Hispanic, German, Irish and Native American backgrounds. I grew up around &#8220;all white&#8221; people and have only ever dated &#8220;all white&#8221; people so I guess, according to you, I&rsquo;m helping bring the other &#8220;all white&#8221; people down. </p>
<p>Seriously, if you want to only date your race, that&rsquo;s OK w/me. In fact, I sort of agree. After all, if all the races get together then all of our differences will be muted. Italian people will no longer look Italian, Irish girls won&rsquo;t have their distinctive red hair and green eyes, Swedes&hellip; well you get the idea. But &#8220;race traitor&#8221;? Geez. Let&rsquo;s try not to alienate everyone on this board.
