<h1><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/23/study-east-haven-police-ticket-hispanics/">Study: East Haven Police Ticket More Hispanics</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FOX News, April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students at Yale Law School on Friday released an analysis showing that more than half of the tickets East Haven police issued along two main roads went to Hispanic drivers, even though Hispanics make up less than 6 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Their report comes as the police department faces a federal investigation into bias allegations.</p>
<p>The report, aided by Yale statisticians, also said East Haven police officers substantially underreported the number of tickets issued to Hispanic drivers by reporting most of them as white. It cited one officer as reporting virtually all of his tickets were issued to white drivers and none to Hispanics, although nearly 80 percent of his tickets were issued to Hispanic drivers.</p>
<p>The Rev. James Manship, who was arrested last year while videotaping police officers in an attempt to document alleged harassment of Hispanics, said he was troubled but not surprised by the findings. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;These numbers support the stories of racial profiling and police abuse that I have heard from my parishioners,&#8221; Manship said in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Justice Department opened an investigation in December looking into nearly two dozen allegations of police misconduct.</p>
<p>The Justice Department sent a letter last week to East Haven officials saying the police department lacks modern rules of conduct for officers, written guidance on the use of force and cited concerns the department may not require officers to thoroughly report all uses of force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But East Haven Mayor April Capone Almon, citing the letter, sent a suspension letter this week to Police Chief Leonard Gallo, who was placed on administrative leave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study by Yale Law School students focused on 376 traffic tickets issued on two main thoroughfares in East Haven, a New Haven suburb. It concluded that 210 tickets, or 56 percent, were issued to drivers with Hispanic names. The Hispanic population in East Haven is 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report compared the names of people on the tickets to what it called authoritative lists of Hispanic names developed by the U.S. Census and other researchers.</p>
<p>The report acknowledged the limited nature of data on ticket forms makes it impossible to conclusively explain the disparity but said the percentage of Hispanic drivers pulled over was well beyond their makeup in the town. The disparity virtually disappears when East Haven police participate in programs under state or federal guidelines, such as seat belt enforcement, the report said.</p>

		<p>Parking tickets are small potatoes, but what is not, is passing off Hispanics as White.</p>
<p>How many ( 90%?) beatings, rapes and murders of Whites are passed off by the establishment police as being done by fellow Whites, when in fact they are Hispanic, Pakistani, Arab, Indian Indian, American Indian, quadroons/octoroons, Iranians or even Asians-anything to hide the fact that these crimes are committed by non-Whites against Whites.</p>
<p>These crimes by non-Whites against the White Race are really low-level guerilla warfare.<br>

		<p>I was recently perusing the &#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; of one Southern California county and was amazed at the number of &#8220;whites&#8221; on the list born in Mexico with spanish names- some of which looked like Aztecs. So what&rsquo;s the big deal ticketing them as whites if they are also wanted as whites? </p>

		<p>I can see it coming now! The police will count Hispanics as white in order to cover up and downplay the rate of Hispanic lawbreaking, and the left-wingers will interpret it as the police trying to cover up their &#8220;racism&#8221; in charging and arresting more Hispanics than whites! In other words, in the political correctness game, you just can&rsquo;t win!</p>

		<p>It seems that when it is to Hispanics advantage to call them white, we call them white.  When it is not, we call them Hispanics.  Simple, huh?</p>

		<p>Go to any major city in Connecticut (Hartford, New Haven, Waterbury, Bridgeport, New Britain) and you&rsquo;ll find an abundance of Puerto Rican drivers with one or more of the following: illegally tinted windows, illegally loud mufflers, booming stereos that can be heard a quarter-mile away, and license plates displayed in windows rather than on the vehicle. Of course that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. Then you&rsquo;ve got speeding, running stop signs and red lights (encouraged in Puerto Rico at night due to so many carjackings), no license, no insurance, no registration, drugs in vehicle, weapons in vehicle, DWI, etc., etc., etc. All of this may be part of their &#8220;culture&#8221; but it&rsquo;s also something that smaller towns in Connecticut aggressively seek to keep out. </p>

		<p>Most of them don&rsquo;t even have licenses, or let them expire, or drive with it revoked.<br>
The only interest they have in obtaining driver licenses is to use as a form of ID for renting, loans, etc.  They don&rsquo;t care about our driving laws, nor about keeping the license current once they&rsquo;ve gotten one.  Almost every horrific accident committed by a hispanic results in the findings that (1) they were drunk and/or (2) they did not have a valid license.  They drive HERE and behave HERE like they do in lawless Mexico.</p>

		<p>Well, this doesn&rsquo;t surprise me a bit. I work in a law enforcement related field, and have known that the FBI counts Hispanics as white for the purposes of calculating crime rates. It&rsquo;s nothing new. Here in Ohio Hispanic inmates are counted as &#8220;hispanic white&#8221; or &#8220;hispanic black&#8221; in the prison system. And by far and away the majority are &#8220;hispanic white&#8221; of course. Once the statistics are reported outside the system the &#8220;hispanic&#8221; is dropped and they are simply reported as black or white. This has been standard practice for years, and I can&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s suddenly a problem when a police department follows the FBI&rsquo;s own rules and system. Someday when you&rsquo;re not busy have a look at the FBI&rsquo;s website and notice the racial makeup of the most wanted lists, and the places where said perpatrators were born. If that&rsquo;s not a wake up call, nothing will be. </p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Students at Yale Law School on Friday released an analysis showing that more than half of the tickets East Haven police issued along two main roads went to Hispanic drivers, even though Hispanics make up less than 6 percent of the population&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ridiculous, giving the disparate rates of drunken and unlicensed driving between Whites and hispanics.</p>
<p>Hispanics SHOULD be profiled.  The Color of Crime reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;there are no reliable national statistics, but state figures may give an indication. In California, Hispanics were 42 percent more likely than Whites to be arrested for drunk driving&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Brenda Walker writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Traditionally, drinking to excess is valued in Mexican and Latin culture, where it is seen an expression of machismo. Moreover, MADD reports that Hispanics believe it takes 6-8 drinks to affect driving, while Americans think it takes 2-4 drinks&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/24jtmg4</p>
<p>The article concludes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The disparity virtually disappears when East Haven police participate in programs under state or federal guidelines, such as seat belt enforcement, the report said..&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.  The disparity disappears when average cops, under threat of prosecution, accusations of police brutality and harassment of non-Whites and real fear of having their careers destroyed, look the other way.</p>
<p>Yeah, better to ignore all those drunk, uninsured, unlicensed hispanics driving unregistered cars than be accused of racism.  Better to pull over Whites that may not have their seat belt buckled (as I was recently, I am small so I put the seat belt under my arm instead of over my shoulder  &mdash;  I was very very lucky.  The cop threatened to tow my car and slap me with a hefty fine, I only got a lecture and a stiff warning).</p>

		<p>If the powers that be start holding officers accountable for the ethnic makeup of those they ticket, the result will be large numbers of Hispanics who drive as they please without fear of punishment.  In the end, people will die because of such insane policies.</p>

It concluded that 210 tickets, or 56 percent, were issued to drivers with Hispanic names. The Hispanic population in East Haven is 5.8 percent.&#8221;<br>
1. Did the Hispanics break the law?  <br>
2. 376 samples is not statistically valid.  It&rsquo;s way too small. 1,200 minimum would be a better size.<br>
3. It is well known that those that learn to drive later in life are less accomplished drivers.  Much like learning any skill or sport.  <br>
4. While East Haven may have a low Hispanic population, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t attract a high number of Hispanics.  Do they have entry level jobs such as restaurants and yard work there?<br>
5. Is East Haven a town inline with a Hispanic enclave and either another Hispanic community or entry level work resources.</p>
<p>As stated the study is a poor foundation for fair legal action.</p>
