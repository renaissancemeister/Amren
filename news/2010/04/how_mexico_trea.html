			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Malkin, Townhall, April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} While open-borders activists decry new enforcement measures signed into law in &#8220;Nazi-zona&#8221; last week, they remain deaf, dumb or willfully blind to the unapologetically restrictionist policies of our neighbors to the south.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The Mexican government will bar foreigners if they upset &#8220;the equilibrium of the national demographics.&#8221; How&rsquo;s that for racial and ethnic profiling?</p>
<p>  &mdash;  If outsiders do not enhance the country&rsquo;s &#8220;economic or national interests&#8221; or are &#8220;not found to be physically or mentally healthy,&#8221; they are not welcome. Neither are those who show &#8220;contempt against national sovereignty or security.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Illegal entry into the country is equivalent to a felony punishable by two years&rsquo; imprisonment. Document fraud is subject to fine and imprisonment; so is alien marriage fraud. Evading deportation is a serious crime; illegal re-entry after deportation is punishable by ten years&rsquo; imprisonment. Foreigners may be kicked out of the country without due process and the endless bites at the litigation apple that illegal aliens are afforded in our country {snip}.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Law enforcement officials at all levels  &mdash;  by national mandate  &mdash;  must cooperate to enforce immigration laws, including illegal alien arrests and deportations. The Mexican military is also required to assist in immigration enforcement operations. Native-born Mexicans are empowered to make citizens&rsquo; arrests of illegal aliens and turn them in to authorities.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Ready to show your papers? Mexico&rsquo;s National Catalog of Foreigners tracks all outside tourists and foreign nationals. A National Population Registry tracks and verifies the identity of every member of the population, who must carry a citizens&rsquo; identity card. Visitors who do not possess proper documents and identification are subject to arrest as illegal aliens.</p>
<p>{snip} There&rsquo;s been no public clamor for &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; in Mexico, however, because pro-illegal alien speech by outsiders is prohibited.</p>
<p>Consider: Open-borders protesters marched freely at the Capitol building in Arizona, comparing GOP Gov. Jan Brewer to Hitler, waving Mexican flags, advocating that demonstrators &#8220;Smash the State,&#8221; and holding signs that proclaimed &#8220;No human is illegal&#8221; and &#8220;We have rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>But under the Mexican constitution, such political speech by foreigners is banned. Noncitizens cannot &#8220;in any way participate in the political affairs of the country.&#8221; In fact, a plethora of Mexican statutes enacted by its congress limit the participation of foreign nationals and companies in everything from investment, education, mining and civil aviation to electric energy and firearms. Foreigners have severely limited private property and employment rights (if any).</p>
<p>As for abuse, the Mexican government is notorious for its abuse of Central American illegal aliens who attempt to violate Mexico&rsquo;s southern border. {snip} In late 2008, the Mexican government launched an aggressive deportation plan to curtain illegal Cuban immigration and human trafficking through Cancun.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexico is doing the job Arizona is now doing  &mdash;  a job the U.S. government has failed miserably to do: putting its people first. {snip}</p>

		<p>The empire is falling apart.  </p>
<p>A nation that can&rsquo;t&hellip;.or won&rsquo;t&hellip;. control it&rsquo;s border isn&rsquo;t a nation at all, and in the case of empires like this one, an empire is only as strong as its central core.</p>
<p>This core is weak and getting weaker every day.</p>

		<p>Well&hellip; Back in my younger days I worked illegally in Mexico for a semester, putting together a new university program for a major institution. I was on a tourist visa, and the university said it was just too much of a hassle to try to get me a working visa.</p>
<p>I joke about this sometimes with Latinos. Don&rsquo;t mean to make light of the sanctimonious bluster of the open-borders crowd, but for a time I WAS an &#8220;undocumented worker&#8221; in Mexico myself! </p>
<p>Actually, it makes it harder for them to come down on me as a &#8220;racist&#8221; when I advocate controlling the border now. Afterall, I wouldn&rsquo;t have put up a peep of protest if caught and told to leave. Gotta respect other country&rsquo;s laws, you know.</p>

		<p> The facts reported by Malkin are precisely the same ones I mentioned in a column I wrote about the Arizona immigration law on my website, www.oldcorporal.com . I notified two of my cousins who live in Arizona about the column; both read it. One liked and agreed with it completely; the other sent me a nasty e-mail about it, questioning what I said about Central American illegal immigrants into Mexico being brutalized by the army and police. Glad to see I was right.</p>
<p> Malkin&rsquo;s column shows conclusively that Mexico is being a colossal hypocrite about this issue of illegal immigration. Calderon&rsquo;s motto apparently is, &#8220;Do as I say, don&rsquo;t do as I do.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This country is failing due to the self serving agenda of our elected officials. In my eyes, they are committing treason by not only allowing the illegals to flow freely across the border but also fighting to keep them here. We need an immigration policy that mirrors Mexico&rsquo;s, then let them call us racist.</p>

		<p>Well, HERE&rsquo;s a plan:  why don&rsquo;t we just copy Mexico&rsquo;s laws and procedures for the handling of illegal aliens, word for word, and adopt them here?  Doesn&rsquo;t that epitomize international cooperation?  It&rsquo;d suit me just fine!</p>

		<p>Mexicans are a racist lot, in the extreme, even if they are by and large mestizo &hellip; a mix. Ironic, save for the nature of the source. Mexican Machismo is totally un self-aware.<br>
No surprises here. Just hairy-chested, mustachioed bluster, with a bottle of tequilla and a lecherous spirit.<br>
Mexico would devour the world if it were only COMPOTENT, instead of being clueless.<br>
Of course they abuse foreigners.<br>
Of course they demand a favored place at the table of  the nationss they invade.<br>
They understand nothing, and demand everything. Infants with guns, drugs, and a dangerous appetite.</p>

		<p>Mexico is the most hypocritical country in the world! Why isn&rsquo;t there anyone in the US (are you listening, Washington) brave enough to say, &#8220;no mas!&#8221; Can&rsquo;t we seal the border (after all the illegals are gone)and forget that third world narco-state exists?</p>

		<p>I know for a fact that Guatemalans who try to make their way through Mexico to the US are routinely robbed, beaten, and much worse at the border. Yet Mexican illegals in this country holler about their &#8220;rights&#8221; and make demands left and right.<br>
Stupid is as stupid does&hellip;</p>

		<p>Tit for tat, great laws the meztizo&rsquo;s have, we should reciprocate in kind. How could they possibly realistically be offended if we, the dumbo pushover nation from the north, must model our laws after the brilliant border invaders from the south. I have always had hopes the south would rise again. However this was not the south I&rsquo;ve been hoping for.</p>
