<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8631775.stm">Iranian Cleric Blames Quakes on Promiscuous Women</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Women who wear revealing clothing and behave promiscuously are to blame for earthquakes, an Iranian cleric says.</p>
<p>Hojjat ol-eslam Kazem Sediqi, the acting Friday prayer leader in Tehran, said women should stick to strict codes of modesty to protect themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many women who do not dress modestly lead young men astray and spread adultery in society which increases earthquakes,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have died in Iran earthquakes in the last decade.</p>
<p>Mr Sediqi was delivering a televised sermon at the Tehran University campus mosque last Friday on the need for a &#8220;general repentance&#8221; by Iranians when he warned of a &#8220;prevalence of degeneracy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do to avoid being buried under the rubble? There is no other solution but to take refuge in religion and to adapt our lives to Islam&rsquo;s moral codes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Disappoint God&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Correspondents say many young Iranians sometimes push the boundaries of how they can dress, showing hair under their headscarves or wearing tight-fitting clothes.</p>
<p>Mr Sediqi also described the violence following last year&rsquo;s disputed presidential election  &mdash;  the result of which prompted thousands of people to hold mass protests  &mdash;  as a &#8220;political earthquake&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if a natural earthquake hits Tehran, no one will be able to confront such a calamity but God&rsquo;s power, only God&rsquo;s power. So lets not disappoint God.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 25,000 people died when a powerful earthquake hit the ancient city of Bam in 2003.</p>
<p>Seismologists have warned that the capital, Tehran, is situated on a large number of tectonic fault lines and could be hit by a devastating earthquake soon.</p>
<p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said many of Tehran&rsquo;s 12 million inhabitants should relocate.</p>
<p>There are plans to build a purpose built new capital near Qom.<br>

		<p>Wow, where did THIS Muslim cleric get his degree in geology?  It&rsquo;s really different from everything I ever learned in my science classes!  This is a totally clear example of the dismal ignorance of most of the Muslims in the Middle East.  They&rsquo;ve got a religion that tells them men are superior, which they love; it gives them an excuse to blame women for all their own problems; it gives them an excuse to abuse and torture women (as the common practice of surgically removing the clitoris makes devastatingly clear), AND - it gives the Muslim males an excuse to run around in large groups yelling, shaking their fists, and shooting their guns, for all the world like out-of-control 14 year olds.  They are immature, male-centered, and hopelessly uneducated for today&rsquo;s world.  The religion spreads fastest amongst the least educated - the males love it, and force their equally-poorly-educated females to join with them.  It&rsquo;s really pathetic.  </p>

		<p>Okay, okay, let me try again&hellip;.  God creates man, then creates woman for him.  But God doesn&rsquo;t want man to look at her, so he shakes up the world, Iran in particular.  After all, that is the only world that counts in this disscussion.  God is insulted because man likes to look at God&rsquo;s creation.  Could it be that God wants the women all to himself?  He sure seems to be holding a great deal of virgins in reserve.  One has to wonder what really goes on in haven.</p>

		<p>Is this &#8220;cleric&#8221; kidding? Can anyone really be that stupid? Women causing earthquakes? My God, I always felt Muslims were evil and uneducated. I really didn&rsquo;t know they could be so incredibly dumb and uniformed. Is there one single thing that is good about this so-called faith so many blindly follow? I think not. I also think Obama is a muslim. God help us. </p>

<p>   Iranian women are quite attractive but you&rsquo;d never know it under all those dark layers of clothing. Radical Feminists condemn white American men for oppression  &mdash;  let them try Iran, or any Muslim country for that matter. They would get on the next flight out after only three days. </p>

<p>Actually that is not true. I am a very independent minded American female and I spent 2 weeks in Iran with no problem. I did not feel oppressed or in anyway a second class citizen, if anything I felt overly protected.</p>
<p>It is true Iranian women are on average quite beautiful, but they aren&rsquo;t all covered under layers and layers of clothing. Sure a scarf and hijab (loose jacket) are mandatory but that hardly hides their charms, many are quite fashionable with makeup, jeans, boots, etc&hellip; The only thing the hijab really somewhat disguises (intentionally) is the waisteline and chest size to &#8220;some&#8221; extent.</p>
<p>The women that wear the full chador (black material head to toe) are typically the political conservatives (maybe 15% of the population) and many wear it as a political statement. Many of those women that inspire a &#8220;Yes Ma&rsquo;am&#8221; attitude with one sharp look and they know it.</p>

<p>  Sonya, with all due respect, I would say that you are the exception. Most &#8220;independent&#8221; American women don&rsquo;t like being &#8220;overly protected&#8221; or told by religious authorities how to dress or act in public. You are right about most Iranian women wearing the hijab rather than the chador, particularly in Tehran. </p>

<p>The Iranian government does not want tourists harassed over minor things. As a lone female I was waived through customs, even metal detectors, and given personal assistance whenever needed. The very low crime rate and strict &#8220;no touching/oggling&#8221; rules made it a very comfortable place for the single woman traveler, plus the people are very polite.</p>
<p>Compared to countries with lots of crime and rude men some of the middle eastern countries are very safe travel destinations for women.</p>
