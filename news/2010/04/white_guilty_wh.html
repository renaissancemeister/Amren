			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Johnathan Kay, National Post (Toronto), April 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sandy, Jim and Karen work at a downtown community centre where they help low-income residents apply for rental housing. Sandy has a bad feeling about Jim: She notices that when black clients come in, he tends to drift to the back of the office. Sandy suspects racism (she and Jim are both white). On the other hand, she also notices that Jim seems to get along well with Karen, who is black. As the weeks go by, Sandy becomes more uncomfortable with the situation. But she feels uncertain about how to handle it. Test question: What should Sandy do?</p>
<p>If you answered that Sandy&rsquo;s first move should be to talk to Karen, and ask how Jim&rsquo;s behaviour made her feel, you are apparently a better anti-racist than me.</p>
<p>That, for what it&rsquo;s worth, was the preferred solution offered by my instructor at &#8220;Thinking About Whiteness and Doing Anti-Racism,&#8221; a four-part evening workshop for community activists, presented earlier this year at the Toronto Women&rsquo;s Bookstore. </p>
<p>My own answer, announced in class, was that Sandy should approach Jim discreetly, explaining to him how others in the office might perceive his actions. Or perhaps the manager of the community centre could give a generic presentation about the need to treat clients in a colour-blind manner, on a no-names basis.</p>
<p>The problem with my approach, the instructor indicated, lay in the fact that I was primarily concerned with the feelings of my fellow Caucasian, Jim. I wasn&rsquo;t treating Karen like a &#8220;full human being&#8221; who might have thoughts and worries at variance with the superficially friendly workplace attitude.</p>
<p>Moreover, I was guilty of &#8220;democratic racism&#8221;  &mdash;  by which we apply ostensibly race-neutral principles such as &#8220;due process,&#8221; constantly demanding clear &#8220;evidence&#8221; of wrongdoing, rather than confronting prima facie instances of racism head-on. &#8220;It seems we&rsquo;re always looking for more proof,&#8221; said the instructor, an energetic left-wing activist who&rsquo;s been teaching this course for several years. &#8220;When it comes to racism, you have to trust your gut.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt the urge to pipe up at this. Racism is either a serious charge or it&rsquo;s not. And if it is, as everyone in this room clearly believed, then it cannot be flung around casually without giving the accused a chance to explain his actions. But I said nothing, and nodded my head along with everyone else. I&rsquo;d come to this class not to impose my democratic racism on people, but to observe.</p>
<p>Most of the other 13 students were earnest, grad-student types in their 20s  &mdash;  too young to remember the late 1980s and early 1990s, when political correctness first took root on college campuses. The jargon I heard at the bookstore took me back to that age  &mdash;  albeit with a few odd variations. &#8220;Allyship&#8221; has replaced &#8220;solidarity&#8221; in the anti-racist lexicon, for instance, when speaking about inter-racial activist partnerships. I also heard one student say she rejected the term &#8220;gender-neutral&#8221; as sexist, and instead preferred &#8220;gender-fluid.&#8221; One did not &#8220;have&#8221; a gender or sexual orientation; the operative word is &#8220;perform&#8221;  &mdash;  as in, &#8220;Sally performs her queerness in a very femme way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instructor&rsquo;s Cold War-era Marxist jargon added to the retro intellectual vibe. Like just about everyone in the class, she took it for granted that racism is an outgrowth of capitalism, and that fighting one necessarily means fighting the other. At one point, she asked us to critique a case study about &#8220;Cecilia,&#8221; a community activist who spread a message of tolerance and mutual respect in her neighbourhood. Cecilia&rsquo;s approach was incomplete, the instructor informed us, because she neglected to sound the message that &#8220;classism is a form of oppression.&#8221; The real problem faced by visible minorities in our capitalist society isn&rsquo;t a lack of understanding, &#8220;it&rsquo;s the fundamentally inequitable nature of wage labour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The central theme of the course was that this twinned combination of capitalism and racism has produced a cult of &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; which permeates every aspect of our lives. &#8220;Canada is a white supremacist country, so I assume that I&rsquo;m racist,&#8221; one of the students said matter-of-factly during our first session. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not about not being racist. Because I know I am. It&rsquo;s about becoming less racist.&#8221; At this, another student told the class: &#8220;I hate when people tell me they&rsquo;re colour-blind. That is the most overt kind of racism. When people say &#8216;I don&rsquo;t see your race,&rsquo; I know that&rsquo;s wrong. To ignore race is to be more racist than to acknowledge race. I call it neo-racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the students were white (to my eyes, anyway). And most were involved in what might broadly be termed the anti-racism industry  &mdash;  an overlapping hodgepodge of community-outreach activists, equity officers, women&rsquo;s studies instructors and the like. Most said they&rsquo;d come so they could integrate anti-racism into their work. Yet a good deal of the course consisted of them unburdening themselves of their own racist guilt. The instructor set the tone, describing an episode in which she&rsquo;d lectured a colleague of colour about his job. &#8220;When I realized what I was doing, I approached him afterward and apologized,&#8221; she told the class. &#8220;I said to him. &#8216;I&rsquo;m so sorry! I&rsquo;m unloading so much whiteness on you right now.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Another woman described her torment when a friend asked her to give a presentation about media arts to a group of black students  &mdash;  an exercise that would have made a spectacle of her white privilege. &#8220;Should I say yes? Or is it my responsibility to say no?&#8221; she said. &#8220;But then [my friend] may say, &#8216;I want you to do it  &mdash;  because you have a particular approach .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8216;</p>
<p>&#8220;But wait! Could it be that the reason I have that &#8216;particular approach&rsquo; is that I&rsquo;ve been raised to think that I could have that particular approach, that I have the ability, that I am able to access education in a particular way? All these things are in my head, in my heart, not really knowing how to respond. On the other hand, I also recognize that the person asking me has the agency to decide that I&rsquo;m the right person .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so I say yes!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But then I&rsquo;m still thinking &#8216;I don&rsquo;t know if I did the right thing.&rsquo; I still struggle with this all the time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>An especially telling moment came when someone raised the subject of Third World nannies who immigrate to Canada under government-sponsored caregiver programs. The instructor told the class that the practice was inherently &#8220;super-exploitative.&#8221; She also pointed us to an article included in the week&rsquo;s reading, &#8220;Black Women and Work,&#8221; in which Canadian author Dionne Brand argues that cynical employers use appeals such as &#8220;You know that you&rsquo;re part of the family&#8221; to emotionally blackmail nannies, housekeepers and elder-care workers into the continuation of abusive work relationships. </p>
<p>One of the students  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll use the name &#8220;Chris&#8221; (having promised not to identify any attendee by name)  &mdash;  interjected, apologetically. Chris couldn&rsquo;t help but confess that her own family had employed just such a nanny, who truly did seem &#8220;part of the family.&#8221; For several minutes, Chris gave details, describing all the touching, intimate ways in which the nanny&rsquo;s family had become intermingled with Chris&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>This speech from the heart caused a ripple of discomfort. One woman suggested that the nanny has adopted a &#8220;coping mechanism&#8221; to deal with her subordinate situation. This led to a discussion about how we must recognize the nanny&rsquo;s &#8220;agency&#8221;  &mdash;  a popular buzzword signifying that minority members must not be seen as passive victims. The instructor listened attentively  &mdash;  but didn&rsquo;t offer much more except that the example demonstrated the &#8220;contradictary-ness&#8221; of anti-racism studies. We moved on while Chris sat there, looking somewhat confused, and attracting my sympathy.</p>
<p>In fact, I felt sympathy for just about everyone in that class. In private conversation, they all seemed like good-hearted, intelligent people. But like communist die-hards confessing their counter-revolutionary thought-crimes at a Soviet workers&rsquo; council, or devout Catholics on their knees in the confessional, they also seemed utterly consumed by their sin, regarding their pallor as a sort of moral leprosy. I came to see them as Lady Macbeths in reverse  &mdash;  cursing skin with nary a &#8220;damn&rsquo;d spot.&#8221; Even basic communication with friends and fellow activists, I observed, was a plodding agony of self-censorship, in which every syllable was scrutinized for subconscious racist connotations as it was leaving their mouths.</p>
<p>While politically correct campus activists often come across as smug and single-minded, I realized, their intellectual life might more accurately be described as bipolar  &mdash;  combining an ecstatic self-conception as high priestesses who pronounce upon the racist sins of our society, alongside extravagant self-mortification in regard to their own fallen state.</p>
<p>As I watched, I tried to detach myself from this spectacle, and imagine what this unintentionally comic scene  &mdash;  a group of students sitting around, self-consciously egging each other on to be ashamed of their skin colour  &mdash;  would look like to, say, civil rights protesters from a half-century ago. If the instructor and her students ever allowed themselves to laugh, they might have found it funny.<br>

		<p>I almost gave up on this article half-way through, it was so full of incomprehensible anti-concepts.  But it actually ends up in a very different place than I expected from the outset, so I encourage everyone to jump down to the last three paragraphs when you feel you&rsquo;re about to barf.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;state of sin&#8221; described here is that historically we whites imported cheap labor - some of us getting rich in the process, but also sowing the seeds of today&rsquo;s multiracial, multicultural societies. If we didn&rsquo;t have minorities to deal with we wouldn&rsquo;t see our kids going through these ridiculous intellectual contortions to make their egalitarian ideals compatible with today&rsquo;s multiracial reality.</p>
<p>In the end, it seems there&rsquo;s really only two choices: Keep your homeland as homogeneous as possible, and avoid this multicultural nightmare. Or, to accept that we are a people who have ruled in the past and can easily rule again. At some point, we Western men have forgotten what made us rulers of the world, and let ourselves be talked out of what our fathers won. We can channel this trait in different directions, but have we allowed ourselves to be talked out of who we truly are?</p>

<p>How laughable; my solution to the problem is that  Jim and Karen, should denounce Sandy to all their coworkers for being a workplace Marxist troublemaker and &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; harlot extraordinaire, and then ostracize her without mercy, while encouraging others to do the same. </p>
<p>Indeed, a novel approach, but one that is long overdo; after all, Sandy doesn&rsquo;t qualify as a &ldquo;human being,&rdquo; because she is a treasonous white Multi Cultist and Red!</p>
<p>What else could she be, for even starting this little bit of &ldquo;street performance art&rdquo; on the job?</p>

		<p>This is just too dumb.  This is another contrived scenario that imagines the white guy is guilty of something.</p>
<p>First, Sandy might just be overly suspicious due to her brainwashing.</p>
<p>The real question should be is Jim doing his job or not.  If he is, then Sandy should shut her trap and stop causing trouble.  </p>
<p>The &#8216;preferred answer&rsquo; given is to ask Karen (who is black) about it.  You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding.  That is just fostering gossip.  In reality, Sandy would be instigating a racial issue about Jim that might have no basis. In that scenario you would have two women gossiping behind his back and he would have no way to defend himself.  Karen would then start giving him dirty looks and he would then retaliate by staying away from her. </p>

		<p>How about a more realistic situation:</p>
<p>Karen (who is black) often shows up for work, late.  She sometimes doesn&rsquo;t come back after lunch.  Jim, who is white, has to pick up the workload.  He complains to Sandy (a white woman who is now Jim&rsquo;s boss thanks to AA), but Sandy doesn&rsquo;t want to do anything because Karen was hired under an AA program.  </p>
<p>Karen (who is black) knows she can do whatever she wants because they will never fire her or she will threaten to sue.  Jim knows if he complains too loudly he could get fired.</p>
<p>Jim also suspects some of the poor blacks that come in for assistance are just looking for a handout.  Jim shows them a few possible jobs, but they seem uninterested.  They just want free rent.  Jim knows fraud is rampant and the whole office seems chaotic.  Jim suspects the whole country is falling apart.  What should Jim do?  Just keep being friendly and acting as though he is unaware of any problems?  Just keep his mouth shut and go with the flow?  Yes, that is what Jim will do.</p>

<p>Of course. These people hate the concept of due process and the other principles upon which this nation was founded  &mdash;  especially capitalism. Capitalism sorts people out according to abilities, and that is something the &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; cannot stand, for under such a system, any difference between the performance of the various races becomes glaringly obvious.</p>

		<p>Good God, if we can&rsquo;t simply get away from their abuse, this shows we are guilty!</p>
<p>&#8216;White privilege&rsquo; or at least, the experience of being white, is most closely related to growing up in a dysfunctional family, where not allowing the parent or older child to abuse you results in even more abuse. Better just let the abuse go unchallenged. Thank you, may I have another.</p>
<p>In a sense. . this &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; moderator is right. . the white Canadians in that class do seem privileged, being they are forced to &#8216;interact&rsquo; as little as they do with people of color. </p>

		<p>I have the solution.  They should divide the caseload evenly.  As the &#8216;clients&rsquo; enter the building they are assigned to Sandy, Jim and Karen in a rotating manner.  Each worker would be assigned the same caseloads.   Then if Jim &#8216;drifts&rsquo; or &#8216;takes a break&rsquo; it is his own business, as by the end of the day he will have performed the same number of caseloads as his co-workers.</p>
<p>But that will be rejected as too logical, too metric, too orderly.</p>
<p>Another solution would be to send black &#8216;clients&rsquo; to Karen and white &#8216;clients&rsquo; to Jim.  Then all suspicions of racism would end.  Sandy would not like that, however, and neither would the diversity workers as both would be out of a job.</p>

		<p>It should be remembered that the attitudes of the people in this class,  both teacher and students, directly leads to racist violence against whites in the streets, including the murder and rape of children.  They&rsquo;re not misguided naifs, they&rsquo;re low-level war criminals, they know what&rsquo;s going on.     </p>

		<p>Do the Chinese in China waste their time in self-flagellation about &#8220;Yellow&#8221; privilege? How about the Japanese? </p>
<p>On a positive note, I suspect more and more whites are growing very tired of all this nonsense about their alleged privilege and all the discrimination supposedly experienced by non-whites. One look around themselves on any given day puts the lie to this broad-reaching mendacity about race in America, and hopefully, white Americans will become angry enough and brave enough to begin again to speak out in their own collective self-interest&hellip;as all sensible, healthy mammals would!!</p>

<p>I think those white self-haters need to go to Mexico and address the Mexican priviledge that causes people in Mexico to oppress Guatemalans and other immigrants.</p>
<p>Better yet, go to China and adress the Chinese priviledge that permeates every facet of society and works to keep non-Chinese ethnic groups in perpetual poverty.  Or maybe go to Japan and really lay ino them for the Japanese priviledge thing.</p>
<p>I mean, how dare people who are a historical majority in a land build a society that has them at its center!</p>

		<p>&#8216;I was guilty of &ldquo;democratic racism&rdquo; &mdash; by which we apply ostensibly race-neutral principles such as &ldquo;due process,&rdquo; constantly demanding clear &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; of wrongdoing, rather than confronting prima facie instances of racism head-on.&ldquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There you have it. They don&rsquo;t even believe that you need proof that people are racists. They don&rsquo;t believe in such horrid, &#8220;race-neutral principles such as &#8216;due process&rsquo;&#8221;!

		<p>people should stop using the word white privilege..thats what the liberals want you to use. that way it criminalizes whiteness. then they can say you are guilty of privilege, and therefore need to be punished. there is no such thing as privilege, and if some liberal accuses you of it, then stop them in their tracks. whites enjoy the standard of living they have because of hard work, getting educated, honesty campassion, ingenuity, kindness, order, etc. this is a very scarry word to start throwing around. tell people immdiately that you are not privileged, you have worked for everything you have.  these liberals that teach this suff should be arrested and put in the loony bin for the rest of their lives. after the class someone should follow them home to their all-white gated communities, and expose them for the hypocrites they are. they should be ashamed of the profession they have chosen. if they were doing this to children, it would be child abuse.</p>

		<p>LOL, these people hate low self-opinion?  Maybe.  But you can bet they regard themselves as morally and spiritually superior to other whites (non-whites are cardboard cutouts and outside this status game).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourselves; they&rsquo;re buying into the kingdom of heaven, and their penance, conveniently, involves displaying their moral superiority to the rest of humanity.  You can bet their noses are stuck high in the air.  In fact, what is this class but moral preening?  A bunch of kids one-upping each other in the moral purity stakes, then going back amongst the neanderthals to <i>really</i> get the full effect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d buy the idea that most of them are trying to compensate for low self-opinions, but they&rsquo;re doing it to give themselves a boost, not because they hate themselves; and they aren&rsquo;t wallowing in self-hate, they&rsquo;re declaring their superiority.</p>

<p>Speak for yourself. The facts show that  roughly two-thirds of whites who came to the colonies arrived in bondage.</p>
<p>At the peak of slavery in the American South, only six percent of whites owned slaves. And many of those black slaves displaced white slaves &mdash; that&rsquo;s what they were called rather than the far gentler revisionist term &#8220;indentured servant.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This reminds me of when I went back to grad school at age 52 and found all of this PC garbage lying in wait for me.  I put it down every chance I got.  I also refused to get a &#8220;study group&#8221; to prepare for the comprehensive exams - we were told that nobody had ever passed the comps without a study group prep.  I passed 3rd in the class.  And I never got onto the PC band wagon, which caused me a great deal of stress as I was teaching in a public school.  Eventually that stress became so great that I lost my health and had to quit.  This PC apcray is a total nightmare, and anybody who is about to go into teaching as a career, think again.  You will be forced to teach things you don&rsquo;t believe in, and if you complain you&rsquo;ll be out on your behind as fast as they can trump up charges against you - and they will do exactly that.  I&rsquo;ve seen it happen many times.</p>

Then they could denude herself since everything she wears was made on machines designed by evil white males, using metallurgy and engineering demonically invented by other evil white males. Next she could toss everything electrical and mechanical. She would soon find herself sleeping in a hollow log and eating bugs&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>I once stumbled into a training session for anti-racism activists and teachers. I was struck at how much it resembled a Protestant religious gathering, with the emphasis on constant confessional. </p>
<p>The church essentially preaches the following syllogism: the world is full of suffering, suffering is caused by evil, evil is banished by faith; therefore, the further existence of suffering is proof that our faith is not strong enough, moreover, we bear a measure of guilt for the suffering by our failure to maintain an adequately pure heart. So devotees of the faith get together to confess their sins of impurity and omission, and pray for the day when they are worthy of living in a perfect world. They believe that by purifying their own souls, they can banish evil in the world, so of course they have a moral obligation to do so. </p>
<p>The anti-racism gathering was just like a church group, except for &#8220;evil&#8221; (or &#8220;devil&#8221;) substitute &#8220;racism&#8221;. The emotional dynamics were exactly the same. </p>

		<p>To poster #28.  I work in public education and you&rsquo;re absolutely right.  The PC stuff is so thick you can cut it with a knife.  </p>
<p>No offense against females in general, but it is largely the female staff of all ages that pushes this social justice/caring/diversity/feelings stuff.  (It has long been recognized that the model of education today is very female-centric in outlook.  Look it up on google.)</p>
<p>The (few) male staffers either go along with the PC stuff or they joke about in private.  On the rare occassion when crack remarks are made within earshot of the PC thought police types, the way they get their dander up is frightening to say the least.  </p>
<p>Ex: I once was asked by an older, very marxist oriented south american latina to fix something in the office (paper jam in the copier) that she had no clue about, and I joked (in a very non-threatening, good-natured way) afterwards that that was why God made men, and she flared her mane and got all uber feminazi on me. She even said I might need counseling for my passive aggressive anti-female attitudes. I was like, whoa!  (I&rsquo;m the most well liked male by the female staff and students in the building and have been told so more times than I can count!)</p>
<p>The 20 something crowd is the epicenter of this plague.  These &#8216;teachers&rsquo; have almost NO content knowledge.  I mean, it&rsquo;s so sad that it&rsquo;s ludicrous.  </p>
<p>English teachers that don&rsquo;t know any literature, or grammar rules, etc. and admit it in public over and over! History teachers that admit they know nothing about what they&rsquo;re teaching - week after week.  Science and Math teachers are still okay, but appear to be in retrenchment mode.  It&rsquo;s just the liberal arts topics that have looney social justice activist types.  </p>
<p><br>
I say this sadly as an old-school history teacher who is a walking encyclopedia of the story of mankind, and I&rsquo;m not old yet.  I am just one of the lucky ones who was born and raised before the internet took over our lives.  So I can read, synthesize, act upon my curiosity, write, etc.</p>
<p>Poster #28 also mentioned the phenomenon of group study sessions.  This goes hand-in-hand with the nauseating &#8216;collaboration&rsquo; thing.  Whereas until 15 years ago people were expected to be competent enough to do things by themselves, today the &#8216;I&rsquo;m helpless by myself&rsquo; ethos is widespread.  </p>
<p>Students are now taught in groups and are given group &#8216;work&rsquo; to foster an environment of &#8216;collaboration&rsquo; because that is the &#8216;workplace of the future&rsquo; where &#8216;diverse&rsquo; groups of &#8216;problem solvers&rsquo; will come together to bring their &#8216;unique perspectives&rsquo; to bear on the problem.  Ex: CSI Miami where such a thing is shown.  </p>
<p>But for the life of me I cannot understand why the people who promote this do not realize that to get those (few) kinds of jobs (engineering, advertising, corporate think tanks, etc) the person would have to be highly intelligent from the get-go.  Not four grade levels behind in eleventh grade and barely graduating with a lot of pretend credits.  Such people get jobs at Target or in basic construction where those models don&rsquo;t apply.</p>
<p>(The project-based learning model and &#8216;differentiation&rsquo; business is just a sham of pretend learning to give an excuse to pass the &#8216;students&rsquo; many of whom are 4-5 grade levels behind where they need to be if this was 1985.)</p>
<p>All teachers (save for the racial marxists) know this is a crock and is another way for the multitudes of slackers and thugs to get credit to pass.  (Story is always the same: 1-2 smart and/or industrious kids do all the work, 3-4 slackers add their name to the final product.)</p>
<p>This needy-group thing is widespread among the 20-somethings because they are the generation that was forced into the self-esteem curriculum when they were in grade school.  There are about eight such female teachers in my school right now.  They are so god-awful helpless it&rsquo;s unnerving.</p>
<p>They constantly have to co-plan, have meetings for reassurance, etc.  They cannot do lesson planning solo like real teachers have always done. And in big all staff meetings, they are the ones who are always raising their hands and expressing their inability to understand even the most basic things.  Sometimes the realists among us are left jaw agape and eyes rolling.  (&#8220;And these are &#8216;teachers?&rsquo;&#8221;) </p>
<p>By the way, nearly 95% of their collective students (the 8 helpless teachers I mentioned) just failed the last Regents exams in February.  &#8220;I guess they just aren&rsquo;t taking multiple intelligences into account in their lesson delivery!&#8221;  It&rsquo;s funny because now that tenure is about to be linked to student test scores they&rsquo;re all panicking.  (I have an excellent Regents pass rate, and I don&rsquo;t do collaboration, differentiation or social justice, thank you very much.)</p>
<p>This is why American education is dying.  The attacks on teacher unions are really about breaking job security for older teachers who still cling to notions of personal integrity, grades that are earned, individual excellence and true scholarship in the Western tradition.</p>
<p>When the teacher unions are broken, the mass firings (which are already taking place) will cut loose the cream of our educated teaching force, allowing districts nationwide to bring in 20-something Teach for America types and A/A flunkies who will do group work, social justice and marxist indoctrination.  Then they will quit after 2-3 years and others will take their place.</p>
<p>The collective knowledge of the schools will be in the hands of needy no-nothings who put on a good show and then disappear back into their world of &#8216;white priviledge.&rsquo;  Those who decide to stay will find that when they are pushing 30 (and noticing that their students never really get better) and getting higher salaries, that their admins will be able to push them out at will to get another 22-year-old replacement.</p>
<p>And the walls came tumbling down&hellip;</p>

		<p>It is tempting, but very mistaken, to discount the potential of<br>
applied  authentic psychological science to the profiling of individuals  so as to expand the self-awareness, self-control responsibilities people have about their own interface with issues like differences along lines of gender, race, social class, relgion. Because so much of what passes as encounter groups, discussion groups,etc. are in the hands of lefties (and quacky lefities at that )should not obscure the possibilities of applications that are sound within organizations in the law-abiding dimensions of populist, libertarian, conservative opposition to the PC tyranny. Nothing truly scientific should be  alien to our values and practices.  There are individuals whose own personal equation adequately understood by them would strongly suggest they desist from, say, gender equality issues while expressing themselves moderately and securely, say, in the domain of racial equality issues.  If we cannot use genuine science to help each of to &#8220;police&#8221;  ourselves, there are organizations  &mdash;  some tax supported  &mdash;  who are glad to do it for us without our knowledge or consent.   In fact, they&rsquo;ve been underway for quite some time.  </p>

She doesn&rsquo;t have any authority or responsibility over Jim, does she?  So, isn&rsquo;t that the proper business of the manager to handle?   Then Jim should tell her so!

<p>There is no suggestion that Jim had done anything wrong, nor slighted any black people, nor even the suspicion that he is somehow &#8220;racist&#8221;. There&rsquo;s merely the uneasy feeling that he is not &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; ENOUGH to suit her demanding requirements.</p>
<p>But worse than that is the subtle implication conveyed in the story that everybody should be watching and judging everybody else, and that it&rsquo;s their right and moral obligation to do so. A totalitarian nightmare!<br>

<p>This group &ldquo;work&rdquo; nonsense, has its roots in the 1980s; this was the period where American individuality, was seen as inferior to the Japanese beehive model of social organization.

<p>All that I ever found it to accomplish, was that myself and maybe one or two other capable individuals did all the work, while four or five other useless fools got equal credit for our efforts. Moreover, what little the four or five other useless fools did &ldquo;contribute,&rdquo; caused more harm than good. </p>
<p>The same holds true for me in the workplace today, with the exception that normally &ldquo;teamwork&rdquo; is segregated to the atrocities know as &ldquo;staff meetings.&rdquo; In this controlled forum, grandiose idiots can shoot their mouths off, but do little damage otherwise; while more productive individuals endure the momentary torture and then get something worthwhile done. </p>
<p>Thus is work &ldquo;life,&rdquo; in the good old US of A.</p>
<p>All the best to you Jay,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p> <i>&#8220;Sandy, Jim and Karen work at a downtown community centre where they help low-income residents. Sandy has a bad feeling about Jim: She notices that when black clients come in, he tends to drift to the back of the office. Sandy suspects racism&hellip; On the other hand, she also notices that Jim seems to get along well with Karen, who is black.  Test question: What should Sandy do?&#8221;</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>What a moronic question!   A question posed by an idiotic instructor in an idiotic course for cultish fanatics!   Not only is the instructor an idiot, but Sandy is a zealot and a busybody;  and Jim ( being a white male)) is of course  assumed to be  the guilty party in the story   &mdash;  -   as taught, I note, in the &#8220;Toronto Women&rsquo;s Bookstore&#8221;.  Furthermore, Jim is simply assumed to be guilty,  without any evidence whatsoever, but &#8220;in cases of racism you have to go by your gut&#8221;, thus dismissing all traditional legal protections for the innocent.  Under the new PC regime, you are now   &#8220;guilty until proven innocent&#8221;,  and evidence is irrelevant   &mdash;    only gut feelings matter.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p><b>As for the recommended solution,  I checked back to see, and here&rsquo;s an update on how it all worked out:</b></p>
<p>Sandy, disregarding Jim&rsquo;s privacy and  &#8220;full humanness&#8221;, approached Karen behind Jim&rsquo;s back, regarding the racist suspicions that she harbored in her gut.  Thus,  by treating Karen &#8220;like a full human being&#8221;  (while disregarding Jim&rsquo;s humanness),  Sandy drew Karen  - who had nothing to do with this   &mdash;    into the mess.  Karen, being a friend of Jim&rsquo;s, of course mentions to him Sandy&rsquo;s dark suspicions about his secret racism.  Jim,  taking offense that anyone would accuse him of such a hideous crime, went to Sandy and demanded why she didn&rsquo;t speak to him directly instead of going behind his back, spreading racist allegations based on nothing but her own paranoid suspicions.  </p>
<p>He also demands to know how any of this concerns her in the first place.  How is this her business?  Why didn&rsquo;t she speak to the manager if she had an official concern?   And, while on the subject, he also mentions to her all the deficiencies that he has noted in her own work performance   &mdash;   which he had kept discretely to himself thus far.  He even mentions the rude and brusque treatment that she customarily shows to white clients and the obvious favoritism she very conspicuously lavishes on non-whites   &mdash;  -  thus confirming his &#8220;white racism&#8221; in Sandy&rsquo;s mind.  Sandy bluntly tells him off,  calling him a crypto-racist and a male chauvinist pig, which her gut had known him to be all along,  letting out all her ugliest suspicions about him. Karen comes into the room  and takes Jim&rsquo;s side, calling Sandy a busybody and a meddlesome troublemaker.  Sandy then calls Karen an  Auntie Tomasette! &hellip;causing an explosion.  They all get into a very nasty argument, drawing in other persons in the office, each taking sides, producing a rupture down the middle of the office.  Interestingly,  the blacks took Jim and Karen&rsquo;s side, while the whites (all females) took Sandy&rsquo;s.   Thereafter, in the atmosphere of mutual bitterness, neither side is any longer  talking to the other, and the office barely manages to function. </p>
<p>Due to the sharp racial rupture that now exists in the office, the manager  (who failed to deal with this or even have any knowledge of it)  was dismissed,  and Sandy is promoted to manager.  She summarily fires Jim, and Karen resigns in protest.  Sandy then issues a memo that henceforth gut feelings shall rule  and anyone suspected of male chauvinist racism shall be considered automatically guilty. (However, that is problematic, as there are no white males left to whom it could apply.)<br>
