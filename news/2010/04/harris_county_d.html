<h1>Harris County Deputy Launches Caucasian Law Enforcement Association </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Courtney Zubowski, KHOU-TV (Houston), April 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A deputy, who says Caucasians are now the minority, has formed a new Anglo organization affiliated with the Harris County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department.</p>
<p>Deputy Daniel McCool says he&rsquo;s not a racist and he&rsquo;s not a bigot, but he is the president of the Caucasian Law Enforcement Association.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 20-year veteran deputy started the association about two months ago. He said it&rsquo;s not about race, but about fair and equal opportunity.</p>
<p>There are 30 members right now, and anyone is welcome to join, he said.</p>
<p>McCool said he believes since Sheriff Adrian Garcia took office, it&rsquo;s Caucasians who are sometimes discriminated against.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chief of staff type folks, or the directors, different leaders.  It&rsquo;s all pretty much filled up with some type of what we used to call minorities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, now in our own department, as far as the command structure, the Caucasians are actually the minority and it trickles all the way down.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past, three unions have been affiliated with the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. One known as the Harris County Deputies Organization, another called the Mexican American Sheriff&rsquo;s Association and a third called the Afro-American Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy League.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t where they are going with this,&#8221; said Afro-American Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy League President James &#8220;Smokie&#8221; Phillips.  &#8220;We are beginning to heal in this department.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phillips said he doesn&rsquo;t believe there is a need for McCool&rsquo;s new group.</p>

		<p>Well, this story made me laugh. Clearly Blacks can never see the irony of condemning Whites for the practices that they themselves commit. The good news is that it&rsquo;s been two months since this group has been formed and Reverend Al hasn&rsquo;t shown up while flapping his useless lips about racism.</p>

		<p>Well, this is a step in the right direction. Sadly, it&rsquo;s accompanied by the same groveling, apologies and disclaimers that we&rsquo;re used to seeing so many places. And what&rsquo;s with the &#8220;anyone is welcome to join&#8221; business? Are blacks and Hispanics welcome to join? If so, then what&rsquo;s the point of having it?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this plays out before we start showering accolades upon Deputy McCool.</p>

		<p> A look at the station&rsquo;s website shows that, oops, the original article already has been deleted. Guess somebody got to them pretty quick, huh?</p>
<p> Deputy McCool has the right idea, of course. If Mexicans and blacks have their own, race-exclusive organizations, and Caucasians/European Americans are now in the minority on the department, why shouldn&rsquo;t they have theirs, too? But of course, the mainstream media, the NAACP and the powers-that-be in government will shout this down as &#8220;racist,&#8221; and shut the new organization down, just as someone made the TV station pull the original story from its website.</p>
<p> One final observation: I was sorry to see Deputy McCool go through the usual, ritual breast-beating (&#8220;I am not a racist, I am not a bigot&#8221;) while announcing his new organization. When I post on some blog, and receive a reply to the effect of, &#8220;You sound like a racist/bigot,&#8221; I generally answer, &#8220;You make whatever you want to of what I said,&#8221; or, &#8220;Just how do you define &#8216;racist,&rsquo; anyway?&#8221; Don&rsquo;t give them the satisfaction of seeing you stammer and make excuses.</p>

		<p>I wish the guy luck but I really don&rsquo;t know how he is going to keep his job when the usual media thugs start to hammer him nightly.  Oh he&rsquo;s already got his twenty years I see.  Good thing he can retire when the harassment gets too much but I worry about the other guys in his group.  </p>

		<p>If there&rsquo;s no need for the Caucasian Law Enforcement Association than there&rsquo;s no need for the Afro-American Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy League or the Mexican American Sheriff.  One thing we know is that once blacks are in a majority in a government they discriminate ruthlessly against all non-blacks.  So I suspect the Caucasian Law Enforcement Association will have plenty to do.<br>

		<p>When a black man or a black organization tells you that things are &#8220;beginning to heal&#8221; you had better watch your back!  That&rsquo;s code for &#8220;the black man is in power, and we&rsquo;s gwanna stick it to Whitey now, and BIG TIME.  Nothing is ever &#8220;healed&#8221; with the black man until he has been given the power, the purse, and the majority numbers to begin slaughtering whites either in the employment office, or in actual fact.  And when Whites wise up and complain and organize, only THEN do you hear that &#8220;things were just beginning to heal.  They should back off&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Good for them. And don&rsquo;t play stupid Deputy Phillips. Where do you think they are going with this? The very same place you and yours went when the Afro- American Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy League was formed. Deputy McCool is looking out for him and his. And just what are you all beginning to &#8220;heal&#8221; from, and why would whites forming their own organization bother you? The double standard makes you look (gasp)like a RACIST!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t where they are going with this,&rdquo; said Afro-American Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy League President James &ldquo;Smokie&rdquo; Phillips. &ldquo;We are beginning to heal in this department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah right, does anyone here think that &#8220;Smokie&#8221; wants &#8220;healing&#8221;? He knows that his very existence depends on keeping the wound open.</p>
<p>Phillips said he doesn&rsquo;t believe there is a need for McCool&rsquo;s new group.</p>
<p>Well guess what &#8220;Smokie&#8221; Phillips, President of the Afro-American Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy League, we don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a need for YOUR group! Will you disband it now? Didn&rsquo;t think so. Bottom line &#8220;Smokie&#8221;, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t have much hope for this Caucasian Law Enforcement Association. I&rsquo;ve already heard that they will let ANY race join. Go figure.<br>

		<p>	No racial or ethnic group should have the right to exist, unless all racial and ethnic groups have that same right. <br>

That said.</p>
<p>	Showing favoritism to any individual simple because of race is not only incongruously wrong, but harmful; true equality may only be achieved by merit, and intellectual capacity.<br>

		<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not for the &#8220;anyone is welcome to join&#8221; thing either.  But it&rsquo;s a positive sign to see this type of organization coming into view and hopefully more will follow as the U.S. becomes less and less white.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The Caucasians, the white deputies in the department, were never faced with issues we faced. They weren&rsquo;t locked up in cell blocks and taken pictures of, they weren&rsquo;t called names,&rdquo; Phillips said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s because they haven&rsquo;t committed crimes to the point where they are out-of-control like blacks.  </p>
<p>This black crybaby wants people to think that innocent blacks were treated like that.  Too, he probably thinks black criminals shouldn&rsquo;t be charged.</p>
<p>With the lack of intelligence this black crybaby displays, I have no doubt he was hired strictly because he was black, and I&rsquo;m willing to bet the ranch that he couldn&rsquo;t pass a qualification test for police work.</p>
<p>Chittum in his book, Civil War II, relates how the police always break down in multicultural/multiracial/multiethnic societies along lines of race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing the beginning of that in Houston, and I suspect it&rsquo;s occurring in other large cities where non-whites dominate as well.</p>
<p>The empire is cracking badly.<br>

		<p> I think that the reason that they will allow any race to join is it is probably illegal to have an exclusive white trade group. It&rsquo;s a good sign that we are finally sick of being pushed to the back of promotion lists and being affirmative actioned to death. What I want to see though is this group filing lawsuits when white applicants are discriminated against by the administration.</p>

		<p>  Either US law is about all of US or their is no equality.  Law enforcement is for everyone.  There should be NO ethnic or colorline to enforce laws. Special interest groups have created the need for caucasions to do the same.  Fair is fair for all.<br>
Law is about behavior.        V</p>

		<p>Just as Afro-American Sheriff&rsquo;s Deputy League President James &ldquo;Smokie&rdquo; Phillips says there&rsquo;s no need for this new &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; Law Enforcement Association, so did Carol Swain argue, in a roundtable discussion back in 2003 that included Jared Taylor, that whites shouldn&rsquo;t be practicing identity politics. Basically, both see whites regaining some of their lost power, and we can&rsquo;t have that, now can we? They are saying that power is good for minorities (especially blacks), but it&rsquo;s not good for whites. In a way, whites regaining power is not good, but only because minorities will suffer some loss of priviledge, especially blacks who have gamed the system for so long (with plenty of help from their white liberal bretheren.)</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about Mccool or this association. But I would cut him some slack on two areas. First, I&rsquo;m not convinced he was groveling. The reporter probably asked him if it was a racist or bigoted organization and he simply said, &#8220;no&#8221;. You&rsquo;ll notice it wasn&rsquo;t in quotes. And, second, the reporter probably asked him if anyone could join and he, of course, answered &#8220;yes&#8221;. Just as I&rsquo;m sure the heads of the mexican and black law enforcement associations would. It would be stupid to say otherwise. But I would be greatly surprised if any of those 30 members are non-white. The important part is that he made no bones about it being caucasians who are discriminated against. And that tells you that they&rsquo;re serious about sticking up for their members.</p>

		<p>The white gentleman should have just responded with something like:  &#8220;Well, I was brought up and have long served in an environment where minorities were encouraged and expected to band together to assure equal treatment. And for the life of me, I  can&rsquo;t understand why my people are somehow not expected to or not worthy of the same collective representation. Is it because I&rsquo;m white?</p>
