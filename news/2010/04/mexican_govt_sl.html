<h1>Mexican Gov&rsquo;t Slams Arizona Immigration Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! Finance, April 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Mexican government criticized Wednesday a tough immigration law approved this week by Arizona legislators, saying it could result in rights violations and racial profiling and affect cross-border relations.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Relations Department said in a statement relayed through Mexico&rsquo;s U.S. embassy that it viewed the measure with great concern and said it &#8220;could have potentially serious effects on the civil rights&#8221; of Mexican nationals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexico views with concern the possible negative effects the measure could have, if approved, on the development of the ties of friendship, culture, commerce and tourism that have characterized Mexico&rsquo;s relations with Arizona for generations,&#8221; according to the statement.</p>

		<p>I may be wrong, but it seems apparent that Mexico has more important things to worry about-like civilians being killed on the streets, judges and cops being executed, children slaughtered at parties. Little things like that. But what gets them going? A bunch of gringos standing up to enforce their own laws!<br>

		<p>Mexico is at war with the U.S.  Islam is at war with the West.  They use similar tactics in that in public they claim their friendship, but in private continue to push their invasion and attacks.  Arizona appears to have finally gotten the message, so maybe there is hope after all.</p>

		<p>The sheer nerve of Mexican officials is breathtaking! Imagine a nation whose people illegally INVADE a neighboring country(often for the reason of fleeing that nation&rsquo;s utter dysfunction in the first place), having the unmitigated gall to be critical of how that neighbor country&rsquo;s authorities deal with said INVADERS, and suggesting that this will cool relations on their won behalf!! It is beyond comprehension that Mexico&rsquo;s leaders can be this brazen and obtuse&hellip;until you consider who it is we are dealing with.  </p>

		<p>Wait a minute. We might have something here.</p>
<p>If the Mexican government finds the Arizona law oppressive to Mexican nationals, the normal response would be for Mexico to order their citizens to evacuate the USA. (The US State Department would do that if Americans were involved.)</p>
<p>When will they order the illegals out of my country?<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s really pretty humorous.</p>
<p>Mexico is fighting for it&rsquo;s existence&hellip;literally&hellip;.against well-armed, well-funded drug cartels who could take over the country probably anytime they decided to quit squabbling with each other, yet some fool in the Mexican government seems to regard US decisions on sovereign issues unbearable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for a cartel(s)to takeover one of the states they now control, like Sinaloa, and declare it independent from Mexico.  Or, maybe, two or more states could be involved.  That way they could carve up the entire country, which would make a complete takeover much easier.  Or, could it turn out that other cartels will take over other states and Mexico will be transformed into divided nation, with only a small part controlled by the federal government?</p>
<p>Its hard to say what might happen, but I think it&rsquo;s a given that the situation will continue to get MUCH worse.  </p>
<p>Whatever happens the US is going to be severely affected.  Not securing the border could spell big, big problems for the Obama administration, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he won&rsquo;t increase security.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mexico&rsquo;s relations with Arizona?&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there a Mexican embassy in Phoenix or something?  The only &#8220;relations&#8221; that country has with Arizona involve exporting large numbers of Mexican nationals as illegal border-jumpers.  If Mexico wants to cut of <i>those</i> &#8220;relations,&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure that many other states will want to join Arizona on the embargo list, too.<br>

		<p>A word on Mexico&rsquo;s dysfunctionality and hence its efforts to export its poverty to the U. S.</p>
<p>Mexico has many quasi-monopolies in vital services. These keep prices high, make the nation uncompetitive and maintain a parasitic class of multi-millionaires and billionaires.</p>
<p>Mexico has 11 billionaires, including the world&rsquo;s richest man, Carlos Slim, worth an estimated $65 billion.</p>
<p>Professor George W. Grayson, senior associate, Center for Strategic and International Studies, elaborated on Lou Dobbs Tonight, May 3, 2007: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mexico&rsquo;s elites live like maharajas. But they spend extremely little on education and health care and transportation to upgrade the quality of their citizens. They pay about  &mdash;  as a percent of gross domestic product  &mdash;  the same percentage that Haiti pays, 10.4 percent. So as a result, even though it&rsquo;s an immensely wealthy country  &mdash;  gold, silver, beaches, oil &hellip; they prefer to neglect their problems at home, turn a blind eye to them, and let U.S. taxpayers pick up the tab.&#8221;* </p>
<p>The U.S., you see, is the maharajas&rsquo; safety value.<br>

<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t have a reflexive opposition toward Hugo Chavez.  I think (or rather, concede), that forceful, economic redistributionist center-left populist governments are the only way the average Indoamerican can have anything out of life.  I wish for the PRD to win every election they can in Mexico, because they don&rsquo;t want to push every Mexican peasant northward.  They want them there in Mexico to keep the PRD in power.  </p>

		<p>The dirty little secret about Mexico&rsquo;s official attitude toward our immigration laws is that the Mexican government views our nation as a safety valve for Mexican discontent.  Without license for Mexicans to move northward Mexico would be faced with a revolution that would frightfully threaten the Mexican ruling class.</p>

		<p>Since when did Mexico&rsquo;s goverment suddenly become concerned with its citizenry? As Anon at 8:23 PM says, they don&rsquo;t really care for anyone but themselves. It&rsquo;s all talk.</p>
<p>If there is one country we should invade and take over, it would be Mexico. I&rsquo;ve seen the idea expressed here in comments on various stories about Mexico, and I agree that it would be a good thing. Plus using our own military forces to expel each and every illegal here, and to control the border from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

		<p>Push your dirt-poor, unwanted, surplus population into a neighboring country to &#8216;let the neighbors take care of them&rsquo;, drive your unwanted, least productive over the border and onto the neighbor&rsquo;s welfare system (and perhaps avert a revolution against the oligarchs) and then claim these same neighbors are &#8216;racist&rsquo; when they object?  </p>
<p>Yeah, who&rsquo;d a thunk a country would be SO STUPID as to fall for this scam and not only allow hostile, parasitic foreign colonies within its borders but welcome it!</p>
<p>Unless&hellip;. the government of the rich neighbor to the north has some kind of hidden motive in taking in the poorest, least educated, least intelligent, least healthy jetsam from another country.  Maybe the ultimate goal is to overwhelm and terrorize the NATIVE BORN WHITE POPULATION by driving them out of their neighborhoods, overburdening them with excessive taxes to pay for the new colonists&rsquo; every need and locking their children out of colleges, careers and scholarships in favor of the new foreign colonists&rsquo; children.   </p>
<p>One would think the government of the northern country  HATED its native population and wanted to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Could never happen, could it?  Our benevolent government would never actively seek to  eliminate the Native Born White Population would it?</p>
<p>No, couldn&rsquo;t be  &mdash;  guess I&rsquo;ve been watching too many conspiracy-type TV shows lately&hellip;..</p>

<p>Note that when a Mexican sneaks across the border and has a baby, that child will receive Affirmative-Action preferences for college admittance, financial aid, and jobs, over native citizens.  </p>
<p>Now, what would happen if a White person entered Mexico illegally and had a baby.  Would that White child receive similar Affirmative-Action benefits in Mexico?  Would that White child be given college fellowships and jobs based on his/her skin color?  After all, Whites are a Minority in Mexico.  </p>

		<p>This will come as a surprise to a great many Americans, but Mexicans actually have a country of their own.  It&rsquo;s called Mexico, and it sits just to the south of the USA.  It is a country incredibly rich in natural resources, including oil, copper, silver, timber, etc.  The surrounding oceans are teaming with fish.  The soils are fertile, and in the south, there is plentiful rainfall.  With its varied climate, they can grow virtually any crop known to mankind.  They have a young work-force and low wages, hence, they should be able to produce things at low costs.  Finally, with beautiful beaches, warm semi-tropical waters, diverse ecosystems, and interesting archeology and diverse cultures, Mexico is a tourist&rsquo;s paradise.  there is absolutely no reason for Mexicans to come to the USA.  It is time that Mexico took care of their own citizens.</p>

		<p>If you are concerned about the Mexican illegal invasion (and we all should be) you could end 90% of the problem without ever physically arresting a single illegal&hellip;and certainly you don&rsquo;t need to shoot anybody.  1) Change the law that allows for anchor baby citizenship and revoke citizenship of all children of illegal parentage.  2) End all welfare benefits of any kind for non-US citizens.  3) Pick two CEO&rsquo;s and two Human Resources Directors from each state that are responsible for allowing their corporations to hire illegals from each of the fifty states.  Imprison those 100 traitors for one year in a minimum security prison.   </p>
<p>Trust me just as soon as that first CEO hits prison you will see mass firings of illegals.   Within six months there won&rsquo;t be an illegal left in the country other than drug gang members and the police will easily be able to deal with them when the &#8220;sea&#8221; they swim in has been drained.  No violence and no immigration sweeps and mass deportations are required to solve this problem. No action needs be taken against foreign citizens or governments.  All this requires is willpower by American leaders and our citizens.</p>

		<p>Mexico has two reasons to squawk about this law - the free flow of illegals and their contraband is a huge source of their income, and perhaps most importantly, this sort of anti-US rhetoric plays well at home.  I say that the second point is more important because few Americans realize how deeply Mexicans hate us, and our awakening is long overdue.  Thus far their parasitic relationship with us, their low IQs, their seemingly intrinsic laziness combined with our own mulicultural delusions have kept the warfare at low and insidious levels.  This changes when we no longer agree to be their victims.</p>

<p>If the USG had ANY interest in protecting the Native Born Population and the sovereignty of the US,  the border would be secured by tomorrow, and guarded with deadly force, invaders shot on site, legal immigration completely halted and any/all illegal colonists expelled, green cards, work permits, H-1Bs rescinded and canceled permanently, refugees sent packing.

		<p>Here is Mexico&rsquo;s laws concerning immigration:<br>
Immigrants and foreign visitors are banned from public discourse.<br>
Immigrants are denied equal employment rights.<br>
Immigrants and foreigners are denied certain basic property rights.<br>
Immigrants and naturalized citizens will never be treated as Mexican citizens.<br>
Immigrants and naturalized citizens are never to be trusted in public service.<br>
Immigrants and naturalized citizens may never become members of the clergy.<br>
Private citizens may make citizens arrests of lawbreakers (illegal immigrants) and hand them over to the authorities.<br>
Immigrants may be expelled from Mexico for any reason without due process.<br>
    Keep in mind these are laws for &#8220;LEGAL IMMIGRANTS&#8221; one can only imagine what is done to &#8220;ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS&#8221;.  You will probably find them buried in a hole in the basement of a local Police station.<br>
    So Mexico doesn&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on when it concerns U.S. laws on immigration and needs to keep their hypocritical big mouths shut.<br>
    Like so many posters have already said, Mexico could care less about their citizens when they are living in Mexico, but suddenly they are so concerned about their citizens welfare when they cross the border!      <br>

		<p>Enough, if I had the power to do that, I would personally have those CEO&rsquo;s who profit from hiring illegal aliens put to death as the seditious traitors they really are. They aid and abet the non-white hordes who want us dead, literally. Therefore they are our enemies as well, and should be treated as such. Definitely the anchor baby law is a law that must be repealed, and all benefits to these invaders be cut off. If the parents are illegals, the child should be considered permanently ineligible for citizenship. I would go one step further, illegal aliens would be subject to arrest, imprisonment and execution without trial, charges being filed or appeal. They are not citizens, therefore they have no rights or protections under the Constitution. Enemy soldiers don&rsquo;t, why the Hell should these terrorists and invaders have them?</p>
