<h1><a href="https://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=136868&amp;catid=339">Murdered Grad Student Was Hunted, Gang Members Say</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey Wolf, KUSA-TV (Denver), April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A graduate student was murdered in Centennial last fall by a juvenile gang member who followed him to try and get money, 9Wants to Know has learned from search warrants which detail first-hand accounts of the murder by other gang members.</p>
<p>Despite the first-hand reports and admissions from the gang members, no one has been arrested for Andrew Graham&rsquo;s murder in Centennial last November. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The 23-year-old graduate student was targeted because the Denver Crips gang wanted to rob a &#8220;white&#8221; person and Graham &#8220;looked like he might have money,&#8221; according to the affidavits. </p>
<p>Graham was gunned down in the early morning of Nov. 6, 2009 and discovered in the front yard of a home in a neighborhood near the Park Meadows Mall in Centennial. He was going home after looking for a place to live in Boulder where he had just been handpicked by his professors to take part in a new master&rsquo;s program for mathematical engineering at the University of Colorado. </p>
<p>In a polygraph interview with Denver Police on Dec. 9, gang member Clarissa Lockhart said she and four other gang members followed Graham after he got off the light rail and went down a busy street for two blocks. </p>
<p>Lockhart said gang member Allen Ford spoke to Graham. Lockhart says another gang member nicknamed &#8220;Baby Low&#8221; then shot and killed Graham. </p>
<p>Another gang member, who is a minor, told investigators he was responsible, directly or indirectly, for providing weapons to Baby Low and said Baby Low told him he was the shooter, according to the affidavits. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>9Wants to Know has learned some of the gang members involved in Graham&rsquo;s murder were part of the racially-motivated violent attacks on white people in Lower Downtown Denver and along the 16th Street Mall last summer, according to the affidavits. </p>
<p>Denver Metro Gang Task Force members say the Crips were targeting white individuals for robberies for about six months before Graham&rsquo;s death. Police say the gang was responsible for robbing, assaulting and attacking as many as 26 people during that time. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Denver Police arrested Lockhart and Ford later on Nov. 19 in connection with the robberies and assaults. That was 13 days after Graham&rsquo;s murder. </p>
<p>9Wants to Know asked the Denver Police chief, the Denver District Attorney&rsquo;s office and the Arapahoe County District Attorney to comment on the delay in arresting and charging at least two of the gang members in the initial attacks, which may have prevented Graham&rsquo;s murder. </p>
<p>All agencies declined to comment. </p>

		<p>Horrible but common story. Here&rsquo;s a young person making the sacrifice of being a graduate student having his life ended senselessly young by some marauding low life losers. And what can you then do to these types of perpetrators? Sending them to prison is like tossing Br&rsquo;er Rabbit into the briar patch, they&rsquo;ll just feel at home there.  </p>

		<p>Given their incredible propensity for violent crime it would seem perfectly reasonable to establish ordinances forbidding blacks to gather in groups of more than three and establishing a curfew for them of sundown local time.</p>
<p>If whites attacked blacks with the same frequency of the obverse, that&rsquo;s exactly how the whites would be handled. </p>

		<p>This past week 3 black escapees from a La prison were caught in Miami.  Found in their vehicle was an id of a student attending Florida State University in Tallahassee.  A search for the male student began after he was missing on the way home from a friend to his apartment.  A large on campus vigil was held for him as he remains missing.</p>
<p>What do these stories have in common?  Many of this country&rsquo;s universities and colleges are targeted by gangs who have easy access within liberal LE jurisdictions.  The increasing integration of low-lifes into the college campus has turned what was once one of the safest environments for our children into one of the most deadly.  As with the rest of our society, we are being hemmed into a corner, fearing for our lives and fearing for protecting our lives.  It is a nightmare that is becoming ever more impossible to awaken from.  God help us.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Denver Metro Gang Task Force members say the Crips were targeting white individuals for robberies for about six months before Graham&rsquo;s death. Police say the gang was responsible for robbing, assaulting and attacking as many as 26 people during that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How odd it is, that in a story where it is admitted &ldquo;targeting white individuals for robberies&rdquo; was the goal of an established criminal terrorist group that led to a murder, the concepts of &ldquo;hate crimes&rdquo; or &ldquo;racial motivations&rdquo; are never expounded upon. While typical of the Marxstream media in the multicultural sensitivity mode, it is really stranger in a secondary fashion. This being, that neither they or the police agencies seem to want to wade into the pool of &ldquo;fashionable&rdquo; excuse making, that indicates the whites were targeted for only &ldquo;socioeconomic disparities,&rdquo; and not race. </p>
<p>Have these &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; and &ldquo;tolerant&rdquo; idiots finally figured out that being too blatant with their masking propaganda, doesn&rsquo;t work anymore? Or, have they really begun to worry about how a serious white backlash, might really view such openly stupid treachery?</p>
<p>In any event, it is a sign of change; and, we are not talking Obama &ldquo;change&rdquo; here, in the least!</p>
<p>May God let it be so!!!!</p>

		<p>This is only indirectly about the story above; this is about white men pulling their thumbs out and finally starting to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Today, in the United States Government, white men have been rendered defenseless against racial and sexual discrimination!  According to the Government&rsquo;s administrative law, only blacks, Hispanics, women, and the handicapped can be considered victims of discrimination.  These are called &#8220;protected groups.&#8221;  White men are not designated &#8220;protected,&#8221; so white men are not permitted to enter a defense against racial or sexual discrimination.  This is a flagrant, blatant violation of not only morality and common sense, but also civil rights laws and the Constitution of the United States.  </p>
<p>Now, gentle readers, are you going to continue to sit like a bunch of capons on the way to the oven, or are you going to call your Senators and representative and demand to know why they are holding still while this outrage continues?  This is a legitimate target, clearly outlined.  </p>

		<p>So they have a whole lists of names, of who did what, but no arrests yet? </p>
<p>And lets see the police strung video cameras down town due to the anti-white violence, knew it was going on, and did nothing for months and months while people were brutalized?</p>
<p>The justice system there in Denver Metro doesn&rsquo;t move all that fast, does it?</p>

		<p>Andrew Graham had an IQ higher than that of all his assailants added together. I can&rsquo;t help but think of the ending of Schindler&rsquo;s list where the Talmudic inscription on his memorial is shown:&#8221;He who saves a life eventually saves the world.&#8221; Think of all the wonderful, creative math-capable children and grand children who will not be born to this man. Now imagine the violent people that will be spawned by Baby Low and Clarissa Lockhart.</p>

<p>And the reason these attacks and others take place and are so numerous and vicious is because blacks are incited constantly within their communities and by leftist whites and black demagogues with the lie that they can&rsquo;t get ahead because of white racism and oppressiion, when the truth is that they just don&rsquo;t possess the mental abilities to compete in a first world society anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>Myths about treachery by whites abound in every black community:  Whites introduced aids and drugs into their neighborhoods to kill them off, just as they blew up the levees in N.O. to drown the ones there, etc., etc.  </p>
<p>Also, non-stop, 24/7, the main topic of conversation among blacks is about mythical injustices by whites of one kind or another, until the most ludicrous stories imaginable are accepted as absolute fact.  </p>
<p>Black leaders and white radicals are responsible for every black on white mob attack that occurs, just as they are responsible for these mob attacks occurring now.  Blacks are looking to even the score against whitey.</p>
<p>The police are guilty of encouraging black on white crime as well, by refusing to call an obvious hate crime a hate crime.  It happens time and again, and their willing accomplices in the media are even more apt to not only ignore the hate in the crime but many times they refuse to report the incident at all as being perpetrated by blacks.</p>
<p>But look at the situation when it comes to whites!  Bizarre allegations of tea party members screaming the &#8220;n&#8221; word and spitting on blacks is accepted as fact even though anybody with half a brain knows it&rsquo;s a lie, and it is reported over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Black crybabies and liars are a big problem for us, but an even greater one involves whites who take up the mantra of political correctness.  They&rsquo;re our greatest enemies, because they&rsquo;re so gullible, stupid and easily swayed with propaganda.</p>
<p>It is the radical whites who should be our primary targets. <br>

		<p>I often think about how lucky I have been in my life. I went to grad school in DC and was the only non-black in my neighborhood on South Capitol St. </p>
<p>I can handle myself man to man but all that Bruce Lee/Steven Seagal garbage about one man fighting off a gang of ten is nonsense - especially if they are armed. And blacks always attack in packs anyway.</p>
<p>To the government/police/media he was just an evil white man but Andrew Graham was someone&rsquo;s son, brother, nephew, friend and would have been someones father and husband. </p>

The police seem incapable of arresting those whom they know are responsible for this and other like crimes and they certainly aren&rsquo;t going to be able to arrest every White person in the country.<br>

		<p>And how many more of us are going to be hunted and killed before we finally realize that we&rsquo;re in a war for survival?  Our very lives and futures are at stake and I feel that not enough people are in full realization of what lies ahead.  I&rsquo;ve read all about South Africa and the wanton murders of White farmers.  I didn&rsquo;t believe it until I met a White South African in person and she told me basically the same as what I was reading.  The same thing is going to happen in the United States and elsewhere unless we start educating ourselves to this growing threat against our race.</p>

		<p>Are you surprised that you&rsquo;ve never heard of these sickening attacks based on racial hatred? You didn&rsquo;t see saturation coverage on the news. You didn&rsquo;t hear politicians decrying racism.  That is, because its  just white victims beaten and murdered based completely on racial hatred. Because of that, the national media  and civil rights leaders ignore them.  If these acts of savagery had indeed happened with the blacks being the victims you would have heard about them. But because they were perpetrated by blacks against whites, even though they were based completely on racial hatred, the national media, politicians, and civil rights leaders ignore them. And even in the local news, the races of the people involved are often not mentioned. </p>

  One wonders what would have been the lifetime contribution to the American economy if Andrew Graham had not been murdered? How much tax would he had paid into the system?, Would America and the World in general would have benefitted from work or inventiveness Andrew Graham displayed?, could he have discovered a new process?, be in charge of capital intensive projects?, would the World have benifitted from his talent?<br>
  Now one wonders of the intellectual prowess of his murderer.Likely to spend the rest of his life in prison (thus costing the taxpayer a small fortune), even if he ever did a day&rsquo;s work in his life, just what value would it have? Another point, how many women has the murderer impregnated?, how many descendants carry his genes and personality traits?<br>
  - What an utterly, utterly sick World we live in today.</p>

		<p>From Post # 8, above: &#8220;Notice that we aren&rsquo;t hearing about this from the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; media, right wing talk radio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talk radio CANNOT BE TRUSTED.  Their goal is to make money by getting more listeners, which allows them to charge more to advertisers.  They are a dog &amp; pony show.  To generate more listeners, they do touch on topics of concern to the White, traditional majority, and tap into our pent-up frustrations.  However, there are a great many topics that they will not touch, and, in fact they actually take an opposite view to many of our views.  </p>
<p>Follow the money.  Once you know who owns the radio stations, then you will know their &#8220;agenda.&#8221;   In some ways, talk radio is a diversion – it allows the letting off of steam, without actually solving the real cause of our problems.  Talk radio can mislead us down the wrong path.  </p>
<p>Be very careful about Talk radio   &mdash;   think for yourself.<br>

		<p>To poster #3.  It&rsquo;s true. Colleges used to be the one place where everyone you met was civilized to one degree or another (in the context of being young 20-somethings, of course).  I know because I&rsquo;ve attended three different colleges around the country for many years.</p>
<p>Near the end of my college run, I began to notice more &#8216;disadvantaged students&rsquo; running around the campus, acting the fool, as they say.</p>
<p>The other day, I was passing by my alma mater and was shocked to see bona fide gang bangers walking into the campus, unchallenged by the african american guard sitting in the booth, staring blankly into space.  (In the old days, uncaring guards used to at least read the paper!)</p>
<p>Since most whites have moved away from the city centers, college students ARE the new walking ATM machines.  I won&rsquo;t send my kids to any college that is surrounded by a growing ghetto.  (I read the other day that Yale has such a nearby ghetto and that many city colleges across the nation are now magnets of crime.)  </p>
<p>Combine these factors and get the big picture:</p>
<p>#1  There is a general assualt on the teaching profession in public schools.  (Get rid of the higher paid, old school teachers to bring in 20-something &#8216;at-will&rsquo; temp teachers who know nothing of their subjects, but do promote social justice in everything.  Read: group poster board projects made up of cut-and-paste web stuff and glitter and glue titles on some aspect or &#8216;legacy&rsquo; of oppression.)</p>
<p>#2  Colleges are getting on the diversity, social justice bandwagon and are denying tenure to professors left and right.  Your child has a 70% chance now of being taught by a grad student or &#8216;adjunct&rsquo; (read: temporary) professor rather than a real, dyed-in-the-wool qualified professor who is an expert in their field.  Did I mention they are now rating college professors on their pass (&#8216;success&rsquo;) rates?  This shifts the burden to succeed from the student to the professor, who is now made afraid for his job.  Don&rsquo;t forget the new &#8216;diversity&rsquo; hiring also!</p>
<p>#3  American college campuses are becoming more dangerous, er, sorry, more &#8216;integrated&rsquo; places of &#8216;inclusion&rsquo; and social &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;  Read: there&rsquo;s more black kids to beat up your white son and &#8216;get it on&rsquo; with your white daughter.  Gang bangers and illiterate &#8216;disadvantaged&rsquo; third worlders welcome, of course, to &#8216;reflect&rsquo; more diversity.</p>
<p>The free land of the westward migration is no more.  The manufacturing base has gone to China.  The neighborhoods are now targeted for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and becoming unsafe all over the nation.  </p>
<p>Wildly different ethnic groups - illiterate and uncivilized - are being sprinkled all over the land where there&rsquo;s not enough blacks to move in.  Mexicans are being brought in in such numbers that they will be half our country in 30 years.  And finally, our educational system is being warped and mangled under a shower of &#8216;social justice&rsquo; inititatives. Whites are fingered as guilty for all the ills that affect mankind everywhere, and American whites, in particular, are forced to feel as if they have oppressed every single solitary human on the planet, and they must serve those people and given them freebies to no end to make amends! </p>
<p>Where do you think we will be in 10-20 years?  Ah, how a superpower falls with a whimper.  It has happened before.  It will happen again.  It is happening now, and the juggernaut cannot be stopped now. I&rsquo;m just sad that I&rsquo;ll be too old when things really hit the fan to really make a stand for my few surviving compatriots and family members.  IT was a good ride while it lasted, my friends, but whites are slated for permanent dispossession, even in our historic homelands in Europe.</p>

		<p>Until I lived in Birmingham for a while, I had never even considered carrying a weapon of any kind.  Now thanks to the increasing thuggery around us, I&rsquo;m always armed with at least pepper spray.  Besides raising hell to legislators, it&rsquo;s time for all whites,especially females to think in terms of refusing to be a victim.  I do not go looking for trouble, but I absolutely refuse to back down when confronted by one of these<br>
thugs. Again, get armed with a weapon or at least pepper spray, stay in good physical condition, and stay aware of your surroundings.  I&rsquo;m a 5&rsquo;7 white female, and it has been my experience that when blacks are confronted by a white who refuses to show fear, they back off.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The increasing integration of low-lifes into the college campus has turned what was once one of the safest environments for our children into one of the most deadly&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was in college a white man was murdered by the black gangster non student boyfriend of a filipino girl student who lived in the same apartment as the murder victim.</p>
<p>The black man met the girl in junior high and never let her go.<br>
The girl was desperate to end the relationship but the black guy kept her with threats of death and retribution against her family (she said)</p>
<p>The black boyfriend murdered the white man because he lived next door to her in the apartment house.  The murderer arrived at his girl friends one late afternoon.  He held a gun to her head and told her &#8220;call that guy and ask him to come over or I will kill you and my homeboys will kill your family.&#8221; (she said)</p>
<p>She did call the white man.  His roommates were there when she made the call.  He went to the girl&rsquo;s apartment.  Boyfriend and 3 buddies seized him and shoved him down on the bed.  They had a silencer and also smothered the sound with a pillow.</p>
<p>They shot the white man.  They were caught about 36 hours later.<br>
They dumped the body in a public park that has very sparse bushes. Naturally he was found 7/am next morning by park workers.</p>
<p>He had his wallet in his pocket so he was quickly identified.Roommates told the police &#8220;she called him and he went over there and that&rsquo;s the last we saw of him.&#8221;<br>
The murderers had even left the bloody mattress, sheets and blankets.</p>
<p>Wonder what the IQ of the murders was 65? 70?</p>
<p>Or maybe they expected to get off on &#8220;evil whitey deserves to be killed&#8221; defense.  They actually pled guilty.</p>
<p>Police questioned the girl, the man&rsquo;s roommates and others who knew them both.  All claimed that there was nothing but a normal neighbor aquaintance between the girl and the murder victim.  Girl passed a lie detector test.  Girl was not charged with  anything.</p>
<p>A big problem is that so many colleges and universities were built in nice neighborhoods 150 years ago and are now surrounded by some of the worst ghettoes in the country.</p>
<p>Colleges and universities are the most anti white pro black racist institutions in the country.  I really don&rsquo;t mind when staff are robbed or even murdered by the blacks they love so much.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard on the students.</p>
<p>In New York City, many top students who get accepted at Columbia law, med or grad schools choose not to attend because Columbia is in Harlem and Harlem has been victimizing Columbia for 70 years.</p>
<p>A black basketball player at University of San Francisco, a Jesuit private university not a state university invaded the dorm room of a White girl when she was asleep.  The University did its best to cover it up.  The girl made the mistake of calling campus police who were told to cover it up.  She later called the city police and the rapist was prosecuted and sent to prison.  No NBA career for him.</p>
<p>Had the rape happened 10 years earlier the rapist would have gotten off with the &#8220;To Kill A Mocking Bird&#8221; defense.  That every White girl lusts after blacks.  If she is beaten it&rsquo;s just becaue not only does she like blacks but she like rough stuff.</p>
<p>But Praise The Lord, the liberal Whites and racist blacks of San Francisco have been replaced by race realist Asians who are very enthusiastic of ridding the streets of their city of black criminals.</p>

		<p>There are certain areas of our country; mostly in major urban communities, where the chances of being randomly chosen as a victim, has to do with being white or Asian. I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again&hellip;we are chosen as victims because the gangsta/thug element view whites and Asians as unlikely to put up a fight. That must change. Teach your children to be alert, suspicious and armed. There is a great book entitled &#8220;The Gift of Fear&#8221; by Gavin De Becker. His central objective is for us to re-establish intuitive awareness of danger as our prime tool in assessing dangerous situations and people. The modern popular culture has attempted to deaden this intuitive awareness. I have a mind-set now, that when I go into certain areas&hellip;I expect to potentially be attacked. I am prepared mentally and physically for such an incident. So should we all be. Never take anything for granted. Your life or the lives of your loved ones may depend on it. </p>

		<p>When I read things like this, it only reinforces my belief that the collective US federal, state, and local governments, the news media, and the wealthy elites allow blacks to terrorize whites in an organized fashion without it ever being acknowledged as an organized, racist pogrom against whites.   The same stories with the same kinds of characters with the same kind of violent and deadly results have happened all over the country for years now, and it never gets reported in the same way as K attack would.  </p>
<p>A classic K tale would be a bunch of white guys donning uniforms, going after blacks, and assaulting or murdering them.</p>
<p>A classic black on white crime involves a bunch of black guys donning gang uniforms, going after whites, and assaulting or murdering them.  </p>
<p>&hellip;and yet, these two actions are treated very differently with the former be treated more harshly and sensationally than the latter even though the latter happens much more often and claims many more lives.   White on black murders are treated with grave seriousness while the much more common black on white murders are virtually ignored and occasionally even treated as a joke, like it doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</p>
<p> The level of hierarchical organization amongst gangs like the Crips or Bloods is relatively similar to that of the K, only there are way more Crips and Bloods.   So why are white gangs and black gangs treated so differently by the government and news services when they basically do the same thing, only the black gangs do way way more damage, assaults, and murders based on race?   </p>
<p>I think the answer is the culture of the elites.   The elites keep the majority white population down by promoting black terrorism against whites to keep them in a position where they are unable to take back control of their own country and lives.   The black terrorists also do a good job of keeping blacks down too, never being able to achieve much without being assaulted or murdered for being &#8220;too white&#8221;.    There is an organized effort in government and media circles to destroy our country, and it has been going on ever since the so called &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement.   The goal isn&rsquo;t equality.  The goal is a country without poor or middle class white people. </p>

<p>Myths about treachery by whites abound in every black community: Whites introduced aids and drugs into their neighborhoods to kill them off, just as they blew up the levees in N.O. to drown the ones there, etc.  <br>
Also, non-stop, 24/7, the main topic of conversation among blacks is about mythical injustices by whites of one kind or another, until the most ludicrous stories imaginable are accepted as absolute fact. <br>

I came upon a traffic accident in NY&rsquo;s Lower East side, a heavily &#8220;minority&#8221; area. The victim was a white man. The ambulance soon arived to help; meanwhile a large crowd of onlookers had gathered. There was nothing racial about this situation at all.   But one black guy among them started haranguing the crowd that if this had happened to a black man the ambulance wouldn&rsquo;t have arrived so quickly, that he would have been left there to die,  that he was only getting such prompt treatment because he was white,  etc.  (Btw, how would the ambulance crew even have known the victim&rsquo;s race before they arrived?)</p>
<p>Sheer nonsense!  But a typical attempt by a racist troublemaker to stir up something. And no doubt many in the gullible crowd believed him. This is how riots start:  a hate-filled troublemaker spreading misinformation.  <br>

They&rsquo;d send one (geeky looking) guy into a bad neighborhood and when the &#8220;vic&#8221; was about to be robbed/beat up, about 20 of them would pounce armed with bats, golf clubs, etc. The thing is, they were high school &amp; college-aged.

Don&rsquo;t be too confident.  Sorry to tell you, but that can have its downside (besides being illegal in many localities). You could find yourself facing more trouble than you bargained for.</p>
<p>I knew a man who worked in the post office. One morning, on his way to work, he was accosted by a black thug. He used his pepper spray on the assailant.   Worked just fine!</p>
<p>Next morning, that thug along with friends was waiting for him. They beat the man with iron pipes,  gave him broken ribs and a concussion and put him in the the hospital for a long time. It&rsquo;s a wonder he wasn&rsquo;t killed.   </p>

		<p>I was once a student at UC Berkeley, working in the main library during spring break.  The campus was dark in the evenings.  As I walked off the campus alone and in the dark, a gang of black youths emerged from the darkness and asked for money.  One lifted his shirt to show me a gun tucked in his crotch.  In a split second, I turned and ran like hell into the lights and traffic 200 yards away, nearly being run over by a semi.  I was lucky to be alive.  I walked the long way home and called campus police, who came and picked me up, treated me like I was the criminal and of course did nothing. </p>

<p>I disagree about the K and the Bloods/Crips being so similar.  A lot of states tried to enact laws either to crack down on black gangs, or punish other acts of violence more harshly if they were gang-related or gang-motivated.  The problem is, those laws turned out to be impossible to enforce, and many were struck down by the courts using the substantive due process clause of the 5th Amendment. </p>
<p>The reason is is that the concept of a black &#8220;gang&#8221; is far more fluid than with the K.  With the K, it was fairly easy to tell who was a K and who was not a K   &mdash;   There was virtually no gray area, no in-between.  With the Bloods, Crips and a lot of other black gangs, there are the real known bangers, and there are people who aren&rsquo;t bangers.  But there is a huge gray area of kinda sorta wannabes.  </p>
<p>As far as the news media double standard, well, I think the answer to that is self-evident.</p>

		<p>I used to live in Denver back in the 90&rsquo;s, and I recall one of those very rare cases where a white punk killed a black guy at a bus stop in Denver. One of those &#8220;man bites dog&#8221; stories and the media ran with it. This is what happened. One night these two white guys, supposedly skinheads, approached a black guy, an immigrant from some country in Africa, and one of the white guys shot this black guy and killed him for no apparent reason, and also shot this white woman in the back when she tried to get involved, wounding her. The media ran with this story for weeks. A fund drive was set up for the family of this black guy living in  Africa, so among other things his body could be sent back there. Even the Denver Broncos got involved!!! The wounded white women also was hailed as a hero for getting involved. This case was talked about on radio and even made the national tv  when Tom Brokaw reported it on the news. He did not hesitate to bring up the fact that this was a racial incident and that a poor black immigrant from Africa, in the U.S. trying to make a living working in a hotel, was killed by a white &#8220;racist&#8221; skinhead. This white guy was caught and sentenced to death. The guy with him was given life even though he wasn&rsquo;t involved in the shooting. One newspaper reporter had the guts to look into the past of the guy who did the shooting. He came from a dysfunctional home, had a tough childhood. But what I find ironic is no liberals made excuses for this guy&rsquo;s behavior. Now fast forward to what happened in Denver to this white grad student. It was obviously a racial killing, but you won&rsquo;t hear it in the MSM or by Tom Brokaw It isn&rsquo;t newsworthy. And will there be a fund drive for this guy&rsquo;s family? Will the Denver sports teams get involved? I think not. The racial aspect of this crime will never be reported. To the MSM the lives of whites murdered by blacks mean nothing. It is just a consequence of having poor underprivliged and misunderstood blacks living among us.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Black leaders and white radicals are responsible for every black on white mob attack that occurs, just as they are responsible for these mob attacks occurring now. Blacks are looking to even the score against whitey.</p>
<p>The police are guilty of encouraging black on white crime as well, by refusing to call an obvious hate crime a hate crime. It happens time and again, and their willing accomplices in the media are even more apt to not only ignore the hate in the crime but many times they refuse to report the incident at all as being perpetrated by blacks.</p>
<p>But look at the situation when it comes to whites! Bizarre allegations of tea party members screaming the &ldquo;n&rdquo; word and spitting on blacks is accepted as fact even though anybody with half a brain knows it&rsquo;s a lie, and it is reported over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Black crybabies and liars are a big problem for us, but an even greater one involves whites who take up the mantra of political correctness. They&rsquo;re our greatest enemies, because they&rsquo;re so gullible, stupid and easily swayed with propaganda.&#8221;</p>
<p>- - Well put Ice. Don&rsquo;t overlook the media though, because they are the ones reporting and demonizing Whites.  We have to look at who the people are behind all this negative media propaganda to really understand who and what the forces are leading all these non-White to hate Whites.  Another factor is groups like the ADL, who actually TRAIN many police departments and while doing so convey their own ideas to the police officers being trained.</p>

		<p>In the late 1960s Detroit had a program called STRESS (Stop The Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets).  This program involved cops dressing up like vulnerable older, weaker citizens and walking in areas of high crime.  When accosted, they were extremely successful in &#8220;taking out&#8221; the criminals as many of the criminals &#8220;met their maker&#8221;.  As almost all the criminals dispatched were black, coleman a young made geting rid of this successful &#8220;crime reduction program&#8221; a staple of his run for mayor.  Hence, Detroit gained its title of &#8220;murder capital&#8221;.</p>
