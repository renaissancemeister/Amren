			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A British family is at the centre of am astonishing legal case in America after telling a luxury hotel they did not want to be served by a black waiter.</p>
<p>Their apparent racist request was entered into the computer of a five star Ritz-Carlton hotel on checking in and a black waiter was later stopped from serving them.</p>
<p>Haitian born Wadner Tranchant claims he was turned away from serving the family during their recent stay at the hotel in Naples, Florida, to avoid upsetting them.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing the 40-year-old named the principal family member as Rodney Morgan.</p>
<p>Court papers did not list an address for the family but identified them as a British family who were registered at the hotel from February 28th.</p>
<p>&#8216;My client was prevented from waiting on this couple because he was black,&rsquo; said lawyer Michael McDonnell.</p>
<p>According to a court papers filed against the beach front Ritz-Carlton hotel, managers breached the Civil Rights Act by stopping Tranchant from serving the couple.</p>
<p>His lawyers say that around February 28th, the Morgan family arrived as guests and specified their preference to not be served by &#8216;people of colour&rsquo; or with &#8216;foreign accents&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Their preference to be served by whites only was typed into the hotel&rsquo;s computer system to alert senior staff.</p>
<p>The note in the hotel&rsquo;s computer system said the family were &#8216;very very prejudice&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr McDonnell said nine other staff members at the hotel have said they were told the British family didn&rsquo;t want to be served by blacks or anyone with an accent.</p>
<p>On March 12th Tranchant, who is a US citizen, was due to serve the family at the hotel&rsquo;s Grill restaurant.</p>
<p>With Morgan&rsquo;s seated in the restaurant he was switched to other duties.</p>
<p>The lawsuit calls the £200-a-night hotel&rsquo;s conduct &#8216;pervasive and severe&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It said the waiter, who has worked at the hotel for 15 years, was left &#8216;humiliated and embarrassed&rsquo; The lawsuit, filed in Fort Myers District Court on Wednesday, claims Tranchant was so offended he has had to seek medical and psychological help.</p>
<p>His lawyers have used the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which was passed a year after blacks were freed from slavery following the end of the American Civil War,to bring the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The Act makes it illegal to discriminate in jobs and housing on the basis of race or colour. The Ritz-Carlton hotel and its manager are named in the legal action in which Tranchant is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ritz-Carlton refused to comment.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s either a race crime hate hoax ginned up to shake down the Ritz, or it&rsquo;s reason to have a bump up in esteem for White Brits who still have natural race pride in themselves and a god given race revulsion at those who are unlike them in the extreme.</p>

		<p>If nothing else, these people aren&rsquo;t very bright.  You never, ever do this sort of thing to service people.  They&rsquo;re bringing you your food for God&rsquo;s sake!  Black service people are bad enough without getting them into a racial tizzy.  And the white service people would have a very hard time opposing a &#8220;righteously aggrieved&#8221; black back in the kitchens.  God only knows what these poor people were eating.</p>

<p>Oh please. This guy has dollar signs in his eyes. I wonder what lawyer is pulling the strings here.<br>
 On the other hand, it could be a great scam. I walk into Hotel, tell the desk I don&rsquo;t want to be waited on by anyone except white people. Hotel worker puts it into computer, stops black waiter from waiting on me. I leave country. Black guy assumes righteous indignation pose, hires lawyer, sues hotel, gets cash, splits it with me and colluding lawyer. Stranger things have happened. </p>

		<p> It seems to me that a family paying the kind of prices demanded at such a luxury hotel as the Ritz-Carlton should be able to specify pretty much what they want, short of a murder contract or nude dancing girls in the dining room.</p>
<p> So Mr. Tranchant was &#8220;due to serve the family&#8221; in the restaurant? What &#8220;other duties&#8221; was he switched to? I&rsquo;d guess, another wait station. Happens all the time in restaurants. Or   &mdash;   and I suspect this may have been the case   &mdash;   were they deliberately seated by the maitre &#8216;d on Tranchant&rsquo;s station, so he could be &#8220;moved to other duties,&#8221; thereby giving him what a lawyer can massage into grounds for a &#8220;discrimination&#8221; lawsuit? Remember, the article says that a number of hotel employees were aware of the Morgans&rsquo; unusual request. If in fact the Morgans were &#8220;set up&#8221; by hotel employees displaying the usual &#8220;outrage&#8221; at said request, it appears the employees may have wound up harming their own employer, instead of the British family.</p>
<p> And here&rsquo;s another thing: If the British press manages to track down the Rodney Morgan family, I hope reporters ask the members why they made such a request. The answer might be very interesting   &mdash;   and also one that the mainstream media, in the UK or the U.S., will want to keep hidden.</p>

		<p>This seemingly obscure issue may seem to be comic relief. The workings of Government courts, though, rely heavily on precedence in order to provide cover for Government judges making future rulings. Once the Government consolidates its control over the medical industry, what chance will patients have in rejecting the services of non affirmative Action graduates of American medical schools or graduates of medical schools based in the Caribbean?</p>

		<p>This episode demonstrates an excellent way of combining our founding principles of liberty and individual freedoms with a new principle (not mentioned by the Founders only because it was obvious and thus invisible to them)   &mdash;   namely, that of preferences for founders&rsquo; or compatible ethnicity and culture, especially in admitting immigrants.<br>
Since our constitution-gutting, tyrannical Federalissimo-in-Chief seems to prefer positive freedoms to America&rsquo;s traditional &#8216;negative&rsquo; ones, how about sabotaging the multiculti/PC/replacement agenda in the following way: fight tooth and nail to allow the broadest interpretation to freedom of association. If business owners and patrons were allowed to hire (American) employees and contractors and select service and goods providers (in America and by Americans) based on any criteria they will, and government entitlements were drastically reduced (and eliminated altogether for foreigners   &mdash;  - including legal immigrants and even naturalized citizens for, say, twenty years),then the free market itself would drastically reduce immigration, especially from third world countries, and would also restore the old social pressures for cultural and linguistic assimilation of all those already here. Many would self-deport under such a scenario (and the Federal government would have more resources at its disposal to perform its legitimate tasks, including securing our borders and deporting illegal invaders). I would add that the citizenship of anyone foreign-born (e.g. Muslim) even so much as hinting at attempts to impose foreign creeds and legal frameworks on Americans   &mdash;  - e.g. Sharia law, or intimidation of lampooning Muhammad, etc.   &mdash;  - should be summarily revoked, on the grounds that such a person&rsquo;s &#8220;Oath of Allegiance&#8221; (taken upon naturalization) was obviously proclaimed in bad faith. In order to survive, this nation and its elites (if there are any such left worthy of the term) must regain common sense when it comes to our positive and negative freedoms; republicanism (the form of government, not the party) versus direct democracy; and the proper roles of federal, state and local governments. And ditto for the other Western-founded nations, according to their respective traditions. As a side benefit, consistent implementation of the above ideas would also reduce the chance of any future B. Hussein-like pseudo-elite demagogue rising from affirmative-action-enabled education, through street agitation and White cowardice, to the loftiest heights of power and arrogance.</p>

<p>This was my impression as well. It could have been a wealthy, &#8220;well-to-do&#8221; White family that did not wish to be served by blacks or other &#8216;unfortunate&rsquo; minorities due to past slavery and &#8216;injustice.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>If the family was really, really prejudiced against blacks, why would Wadner Tranchant want to serve them? And were he to have served them, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have tipped him. Besides, he&rsquo;s paid by the hour, not by the customer, so clearly he has suffered no financial harm from the incident. The whole thing reeks of a shakedown for a payday.</p>

		<p>We never go out to eat, stay in hotels, or take public transportation, including cabs, any longer. It is a fact of life that Blacks and Browns hate and despise White people. They have every opportunity to spit in your food or worse. There is no telling what would set them off, or they may just do it out of pure hatred and spite.</p>
<p>Plus, even assuming the minority food handlers and servers have no hostile intentions towards Whites, Blacks and Browns typically have much lower personal cleanliness and self-care standards than Whites. </p>
<p>Restaurants are usually staffed by an array of minorities and minority managers. Do you think any of them give a damn about whether the food is kept at the property temperature prior to preparation or if the food preparation areas were properly sanitized? I doubt. I see how they live their lives and I am not risking allowing them to prepare my food. Poor food standards is one of the many reasons why third-world countries are awash in disease and squalor, and now those same people, along with the descendants of African slaves, are handling your food and they all have an ax to grind. Think about it.</p>
<p>The same holds true for hotels. Many hotels, even the five star ones, allow sheets, pillows, and comforters to go unwashed for extended periods of time and certainly between guest stays. God only knows what type of person was sleeping and fornicating in the same bed and linens moments before you arrived. No thanks! </p>
<p>Likewise, NO public transportation for me. Public transportation, including taxis, are comprised of filth, stench, and squalor. No thanks!</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, America is a borderline third-world country in most respects now, and slipping fast! Many major cities ARE third-world countries. It&rsquo;s what the most elite Whites want for us. They&rsquo;ve traded away our standards for their luxuries. It is the way of things. Think about it, my friends!<br>

		<p>&#8220;It is of the upmost importance to do things for a guest, anything&#8221; -Concernicus<br>
I also worked over 35 years in the food and beverage industry. And I have to say, to dispel others beliefs or impressions, in all that time, &#8220;ONLY ONCE DID I EVER SEE AN EMPLOYEE TAMPER WITH SOMEONES FOOD!!&rsquo; And it that case it was boredom and a bad practical joke, not vengence or retribution. And no bodily fluids were involved, just squishing their pasta in the hand. I also worked with a lot of minorities in the kitchen and they, like everyone else, understood two things. One, that an act of revenge, undeclared and unseen is pointless and not worth commiting. Two, what goes around comes around or as the French say, &#8221; You never look under the bed till you`ve been hiding there.&#8221; Most waiters and kitchen staff both want to just complete the transaction with as liitle grief or interuption as possible. No matter how they are treated. And that includes the staff as well as most of  the customers. Finally think of it this way. In all of  the  trillions of day to day transactions, why is there so litle shortchanging of someones money? It`s because everybody knows that one moment they`re making change, the next time they`ll be getting it. Don`t belive the urban legends about anyone or everyone wanting and waiting to sabotage your food. It simply isn`t true folks.</p>

		<p>Just to anticpate other posters ready to pooh-pooh my comment about spitting in food etc. being an urban legend, think about this. Those guys in the kitchen don`t hate you, why would they?!? They never  even see or interact with you. They hate the waiters badgering them for their food orders!! And they  know that spitting in a customers food isn`t going to hit back  at  the front of the house staff at all, cause they ain`t the ones eating it!! As for front of house staff doing it, most of them are of a little more intelligence than that&hellip;</p>

		<p>Taken at face value, this was a stupid thing for those Brits to do.  For the record, over the course of our latest Amren informal conference, we always had the same bartender - and he was black.  As far as I could tell, nobody had a problem with this.  He did his job well, was friendly and he probably made a lot of money in tips during those two days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m left wondering what the reaction would be if that same family, eating at a Chinese restaurant, specifically requested a Chinese waiter.  What would the reaction have been if the family, eating at a Mexican restaurant, requested a Mexican waiter?  What if they were dining at a Creole restaurant and requested a black waiter?  Would anybody have complained then?  I think it is fair to say that the waiter contributes to the ambiance of an establishment.  Perhaps those Brits simply wished to have a white American ambiance as their dining experience.  The fact that they didn&rsquo;t want anybody with an accent seems to support this possibility - if by &#8220;no accent&#8221;, they meant an &#8220;American accent&#8221;.</p>

- - Oh boy are you spot on!  Most White people are not aware that Blacks, Hispanics and others don&rsquo;t like them.  Really it&rsquo;s not difficult to figure out.  One thing you didn&rsquo;t mention, Anonymous, is the situation in hospitals, which, unfortunately many times we DON&rsquo;T have a choice about, the Black and other non-White workers just don&rsquo;t give a damn about Whites, they treat them harshly, without concern - and - in the most important type of situations too - life threatening situations.  You do not want your loved ones treated in a medical or hospital setting by Blacks and/or Hispanics or other non-Whites!  The hospital is the worst possible place to have to be and be treated or watched over by non-Whites.</p>

		<p>Fortunately customers DO have the right to ask and have preferences, though as others have pointed out if you plan to eat there it is a stupid thing to do.</p>
<p>I have openly asked about the race of local doctors when I was calling for an appointment (the receptionist didn&rsquo;t know what &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; meant so I had to say &#8220;White&#8221;). When I rented a house recently I asked the agent if the landlords were white (he said that is the first time anyone ever asked about the landlord&rsquo;s race as they usually ask about the tenants).  We have the right as consumers to be as prejudice as we like.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It said the waiter, who has worked at the hotel for 15 years, was left &lsquo;humiliated and embarrassed&rsquo; The lawsuit, filed in Fort Myers District Court on Wednesday, claims Tranchant was so offended he has had to seek medical and psychological help.&#8221;</p>
<p>  So the waiter was embarrassed and humiliated, does he deserve thousands or millions of dollars in damages from the Ritz Carlton for hurt feelings? Maybe, the manager deserves a reprimand and probation from headquarters and the waiter should get an official apology and a few dollars for lost tips. Would that be enough? No, this seems like another attempt by ambulance chasing lawyers and minority grievance mongers to strike it rich at the expensive of American business.</p>

Nonsense!!!! Human beings are very individual and need to be treated as such and not on the basis of being a common group sharing the same traits and personalities values etc.Americans come in all different colours and it&rsquo;s not acceptable to request to be served by a &#8216;white American&rsquo; and not a black person.Which planet are these people from!!!</p>

<p>Natalia, if you really, really believe that group characteristics don&rsquo;t matter, then buy your children a pit bull.  Leave your children alone with that pit bull for long periods.</p>
<p>Now, don&rsquo;t try to tell me that pit bulls are a dangerous race of dog.  You already suggested that members of each group should be treated as individuals.  Perhaps that individual pit bull is a very loving gentle individual?  If you buy a poodle or a cocker spaniel for your children, instead of a pit bull or a rottweiler, then you are an evil dog racist, who needs to attend a canine sensitivity session.  Remember, race is a social construct   &mdash;   all dog breeds, like human breeds (races) are exactly equal.</p>

<p>Agreed. Somehow it just doesn&rsquo;t ring true - and I&rsquo;m not trying to excuse fellow Brits. We wouldn&rsquo;t dare say such a thing on this side of the pond and wouldn&rsquo;t expect to get away with it in the US, First Amendment or not. Occasionally, however, one meets people over the age of 70 who remember the UK as it was and don&rsquo;t mince their words.</p>
<p>If they were East European, I could understand it. They tend to speak their mind and don&rsquo;t give a care about minorities&rsquo; sensibilities.</p>

		<p>29 Natalia Busel: We are not &#8220;living in the stone age&#8221;, nor are we &#8220;out of date&#8221; with regards to race relations.  It is Blacks who are stone age, and we are ahead of our time with regards to race relations.  Why do I say this?<br>
    <br>
Blacks are, by every indication of economics, psychology, or sociology, at the far back of the pack.  Their homicide rate is 11 times that of Whites.  70% of their kids are born to unwed mothers.  Their average IQ is 85.  Their rates for the various sexually transmitted diseases are many multiples of White rates.  Whatever pathology you care to measure, Blacks win the prize.  Has anyone does any scientific research on Black cleanliness?  I don&rsquo;t know, but in the absence of that data, the best bet is to recognize that impulsive people who have high rates of homicide and illegitimacy are less likely to trouble with washing their hands than people have more self-control. Yes there are fine, upstanding, intelligent Black people, just not very many.  </p>
<p>When a White sees a Black, the probability is very high that he is looking at a person who is less intelligent, more violent, less responsible, more sexually promiscuous, less willing to work, and more careless than himself.  Why should a civilized person want to have any dealings with such a person?  True, these are generalizations, but so are warnings against drunk driving.  Every adult liberal lives by these generalizations just as we do.  They choose to pay higher prices for housing to avoid living near too many Blacks and Hispanics.  They even pay to send their kids to private schools that are mostly White or Oriental to keep them safe, and to allow them to learn in classrooms that are not chaotic.  We merely say aloud what most liberals say by the choices they make in schools and housing.  </p>

I read somewhere that in Chinese culture a refusal by the customer to let the busboy refill his tea glass, even when no more is wanted, is an insult. It is considered better form to waste a little bit of liquid, than rebuff a man trying to do his best to do his  job. After reading that I began to notice the look of chagrin on busboy`s faces every time they approached my table with pitcher at the ready only to be blocked by my hand over the mouth of the glass.

		<p>@ Tim McHugh,</p>
<p>as citizenX reminded us, Jesse Jackson said that he spat in white peoples food. If Jesse did it, and admitted to doing it, then I would imagine the practice was/is very commonplace amongst black kitchen staff/waiters, etc.  The fact that you never witnessed it in 35 years proves nothing.  They&rsquo;re not going to do it when whitey is around, or whitey would &#8220;snitch&#8221; on them and they would get fired.  </p>
<p>And your supposition that blacks would not do such a thing because the white customers would never know it had been done to them really displays a poor understanding of black  psychology, which is childlike.  I&rsquo;m surprised at you Tim..!  </p>

		<p>What an odd story.  I haven&rsquo;t stayed at the Ritz - most of us haven&rsquo;t - but I assume that the service there is all first-rate, regardless of skin tone.  It&rsquo;s not the House of Pancakes after all. And what, someone doesn&rsquo;t want to listen to a french accent?  since when?  That alone makes the story suspicious. </p>
<p>I recall reading that a similar issue came up a while back with a black hospice patient whose dying request was not to have to look at any more white faces.  Practical, staffing issues aside, is it really wrong to deny him that, if that&rsquo;s what he truly wants?  I personally have no problem with a request like that, as long as it swings in both directions.  </p>
<p>Everyone just needs to take a breath, use some common sense, &amp; stop running to lawyers for every damn things.  Just saying.</p>

<p>I think it was *Fast Food Nation* that described a burger-chain worker  &mdash;  my image is &#8220;white high school boy&#8221;  &mdash;  putting sperm in the salad dressing.  He sneaked a bottle of dressing home, did his thing, shook up the bottle, and returned it the next day. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thing against specific customers, or the next layer of staff  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s wanting some control, in a boring and rule-ridden environment; it&rsquo;s wanting to pull off a malicious hack and get away with something.  Much more likely among those whose psychology is childlike&hellip;.</p>
