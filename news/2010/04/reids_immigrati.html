<h1>Reid&rsquo;s Immigration Push Vital to His Reelection Hopes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Ferrechio, Washington Examiner, April 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigration reform, once considered dead for the year, has been thrown a lifeline by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., whose revival of the legislation could energize his state&rsquo;s Hispanic voters and help save himself from defeat in November.</p>
<p>Reid made a startling announcement earlier this month at an immigration rally held in downtown Las Vegas. He told the crowd of about 6,000 people that, despite a packed congressional agenda, he wanted Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In football terms, immigration reform may be Reid&rsquo;s attempt at a political Hail Mary pass.</p>
<p>Reid has been trailing in Silver State polls by double digits when paired against likely Republican opponents. While state political analysts say Reid can still win, he is without question in the toughest political battle of his career.</p>
<p>The latest Las Vegas Review Journal/Mason-Dixon poll, taken April 13-14, shows Reid 10 points behind GOP opponent Sue Lowden.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly, Hispanics are a huge voting bloc here in Nevada,&#8221; said Jon Ralston, a longtime political analyst in Nevada. &#8220;Reid has very little margin for error, If he does not get the Democratic base to turn out in large percentages, he has no chance of winning. He needs to get the Hispanic vote to coalesce behind him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Reid may not be able to keep his rally pledge, because few lawmakers in Congress have the desire to take on immigration reform, especially after the politically bruising battle over health care and with polls showing the public wants Congress to focus on the economy.</p>

		<p>In HG Wells &#8220;War of the Worlds&#8221; the Martians have landed and <br>
London is in flames from the Heat Ray. The narrator speculates that the next phase will be for the Martians to recruit Earthlings to their side to<br>
betray the whereabouts of those hiding in return for a place in the new Martian Order. Someone says&hellip;&#8221;No! Surely no human would do that!!&#8221; The narrator replies ..&#8221;You dont think so?..plenty would!&#8221; I can just see Harry Reid scurrying out of his hole to make just such a deal.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t get. If a Democrat votes against what Hispanics want are the Hispanics then going to vote for Republicans? C&rsquo;mon. Hispanics are going to vote for Democrats no matter what. Surely most Democrats realize this, yet they continue to cater to the Hispanics. So why should Reid or any Democrat worry? What am I missing here? </p>

		<p>If the Democrats were able to &#8220;ram through&#8221; government health care, which put their jobs on the line, think how hard they will work to create millions of fake voters through illegal voting and felon voting in order to save their jobs. <br>
But all Americans should remember this: <br>
IF they Neo Marxists manage to consolidate their hold on power through Felon and Illegal &#8220;votes&#8221;&hellip;.the results will NOT be legitimate&hellip;it will be &#8220;Coup D&rsquo; Etat&#8221;&hellip;the results will NOT be accepted by the American people, who screamed for decades to close the borders. <br>
No, Americans won&rsquo;t accept it and there will be a terrible trouble come upon our land. <br>

		<p>Political correctness, hate crime laws, and affirmative action are examples of legislation conceived and passed by communists to attack and destroy the white middle-class.  </p>
<p>The local, state and federal politicians responsible for these travesties are traitors and enemies of liberty who have won themselves a place at the wall.  </p>
<p>However, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned a blindfold and one last cigarette is far more than they deserve&hellip; </p>

		<p>Mr. Reid is old and perhaps doesn&rsquo;t have much concern for the future of the US.  He does, however, have five children and their futures should concern him.  Even Barney Frank, who is gay and childless, has nieces and nephews who will suffer if things continue to fall apart.  The Bushes have grandchildren.  Even the Clintons have a daughter.  Yet none of these folks give a rat&rsquo;s behind to their futures.  How very sad!</p>

		<p>If the point is simply power&hellip;.for the democrats to get re-elected, then why don&rsquo;t they completely undermine and co-opt the republican voter base by giving us what we want, that the republicans (despite lip service) have REFUSED to give us for generations now.  Lock down that border, deport all 50 million or so illegals.  Cut off 90% of legal immigration.</p>
<p>This would give them a permanent lock on power that the republicans would never recover from.</p>
<p>There is a reason they don&rsquo;t do something obvious like this&hellip;..it&rsquo;s not about votes.</p>
<p>And never was.</p>

		<p>Vlad, there actually is something missing from your calculus, and I don&rsquo;t mean third party voting.  You&rsquo;re right that for hispanics switching over to the GOP is not really an option, but there&rsquo;s a third way - not voting at all.  You have keep your base mobilized, even if you intend to screw them over.  Thus we have both parties pandering to them, the stupid party to woo them away, and the evil party to make sure they show up at the polls.</p>

		<p>At least Harry Reid is honest.  He can&rsquo;t get white people to vote for him, so he wants to replace the electorate.</p>
<p>My great fear is that the Democrats will succeed in getting an illegal alien amnesty rammed through before the next election.  That&rsquo;s their grand plan to lock in a permanent majority.</p>
