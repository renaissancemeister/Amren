			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed O&rsquo;Keefe, Washington Post, April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics accounted for 8 percent of federal workers in the year that ended June 30, about five percentage points lower than the 13.2 percent of Latinos employed across the country&rsquo;s civilian workforce, according to a report by the Office of Personnel Management. The percentage of new Hispanic hires dropped to 7.3 percent, down two percentage points from 2008. But the overall number of Latinos in the government climbed to 144,288, up from 137,767 in June 2008. The overall percentage remained flat because the government made other hires and retained a high number of Hispanics, the OPM said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government is not fully tapping the talent in the Hispanic community for public service,&#8221; the report concluded.</p>
<p>National Council of La Raza President Janet Murguia agreed, calling the findings &#8220;unbelievable.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jorge E. Ponce, co-chairman of the Council of Federal EEO and Civil Rights Executives, said that years worth of &#8220;blue ribbon commissions, tiger teams, work groups and the generation of voluminous reports and strategic plans&#8221; have yielded few gains.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ponce&rsquo;s statement strikes at the heart of a pledge made frequently by OPM Director John Berry to make the federal government the nation&rsquo;s &#8220;model employer.&#8221; In a letter to President Obama accompanying the report, Berry said the new numbers signal that &#8220;there is room for improvement.&#8221; The report said the OPM has established three offices to recruit and retain more Hispanic workers, with a special focus on promoting Latinos into the Senior Executive Service and recruiting Hispanic college students. Berry also noted that Obama has appointed a higher number of Hispanics to political positions than previous administrations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>OPM Deputy Director Christine M. Griffin noted that her agency cannot force or mandate hiring numbers for other agencies but said her colleagues are working on hiring changes with a special focus on disabled Americans, military veterans and minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is a piece of all of this. That&rsquo;s one of the things we&rsquo;re making sure we think about and how it permeates everything,&#8221; Griffin said in an interview.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s OPM study follows a February report by congressional staffers that found the Senate has one Latino chief of staff and one Latino committee staff director and that Latinos account for just 5.6 percent of House staffers. Congressional leaders have launched diversity efforts in hopes of hiring more minorities across Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>{snip} DHS and its 23 components generally hire a larger number of Hispanics, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection has a higher percentage of Latinos than any other agency. {snip}</p>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;.?</p>
<p>Am I missing something here, or am I just plain obtuse?</p>
<p>If only 8% of these &ldquo;enriches&rdquo; are employed by the feds and another 13.2% are in the civilian workforce, just what are the other 78.8% of them doing?</p>
<p>Going to La Raza rallies and demanding &ldquo;rights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t employees are generally required to keep rather regular hours, and have specific holidays off, and a specific time for a vacation.  The Hispanic students I taught would often suddenly be absent for up to 6 weeks because Tia Maria in Tres Pedos got sick or died, so of course the entire family had to drive down to Mexico and be with her, and spend some time visiting while they were there.  These people did not keep regular schedules of any kind, and refused to work weekends because they&rsquo;d rented a jumper for the kids and had the whole &#8216;hood go in on &#8220;pay per view fight night&#8221; on Saturday.  So I think that just because of the comparatively rigorous scheduling required by guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t jobs, the Hispanics would generally not be inclined to accept them.</p>

<p>It already employs, I would guess from personal observation of government offices, a 75% black work force. Add the 13% that will be demanded to be Hispanic (initially) and that leaves the remaining 12% of Whites (maybe!) to do the work.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s not enough whites working in Detroit either.  There&rsquo;s not enough whites that are cops in China. There&rsquo;s not enough whites that are whites that are in black fraternities.  See?  Too many whites, racist.  Nothing but non-whites, diversity.</p>

		<p>Well, I guess turnabout is fair play. We must indeed allow more &#8220;Latinos&#8221; to work in US government jobs. After all, look at the many Americans working for the Mexican government - Luis Gutierrez, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Lindsey Graham, Al Sharpton,<br>
Raul Grivijala, and the list goes on.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that low number of hispanics in the federal workforce is due to the requirement that you be a LEGAL US citizen to be employed by the Feds.  I&rsquo;m also guessing that at this point in time, the majority of hispanics in this country are NOT here legally.  Good question by the other guy though - if 25% of hispanics are employed in civilian or federal government WHAT ARE THE OTHER 75% &#8220;EMPLOYED&#8221; AT?????  Gangs, ripping off welfare, crimes of various sorts, and living ten to a room waiting for amnesty I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>

		<p>Probably for the same reason that too many Hispanics ride busses and not enough go as passengers on a jet. Lack of valid documents or disproportionate acrophobia?? You tell me.</p>

		<p>Not enough hispanics working in the Federal Government!!</p>
<p>There sure as hell are enough hispanics working in the California government, county, city,state. I once wondered how many of these people received the &#8220;great communicators&#8221; amnesty in 1986? When they did, they immediately had more rights, and more relevance in the U.S. than the average American of Eurpean descent, simply because Latino&rsquo;s are classified as a &#8220;protected group&#8221;. Nice racket to further your own racial interests, huh?</p>
