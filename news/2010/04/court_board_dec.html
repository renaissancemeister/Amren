<h1><a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5068989">Court, Board Decide to Retire Nickname</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ESPN, April 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A state Supreme Court ruling and a Board of Higher Education decision have retired for good the University of North Dakota&rsquo;s Fighting Sioux nickname after a four-year legal battle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A motion later Thursday at the board&rsquo;s regularly scheduled meeting in Mayville to reconsider its vote in May to retire the nickname died after nobody seconded it.</p>
<p>Claus Lembke, the board member who made the failed motion, said the board was &#8220;giving in to a minority of people on the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UND president Robert Kelley, who was hired in part to help the school in its transition from Division II to Division I athletics, said he&rsquo;s looking forward to managing the nickname transition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In their ruling, the justices said the board had the authority to change the nickname before a Nov. 30 deadline set in a settlement with the NCAA. A group of eight Spirit Lake Sioux tribal members who want the school to keep the nickname were seeking to have the court bar any decision before the deadline.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters believe the logo shows pride and tradition. But the NCAA considers the nickname &#8220;hostile and offensive&#8221; and said UND cannot host postseason events without approval from the state&rsquo;s two Sioux tribes. Under the settlement, the board and UND agreed to begin retiring the nickname if they couldn&rsquo;t obtain permission from the Spirit Lake and Standing Rock Sioux tribes by Nov. 30.</p>
<p>Spirit Lake tribal members have voted to support the nickname, but the Standing Rock tribal council has resisted calls for it to change its bylaws to allow a vote on the issue.</p>

		<p>I have always said, forget any Indian/native American names entirely. Rename the state of Illinois, Indiana, everything and destroy every reference to the American Indian. Out of respect, of course!  Once society has whitewashed over their history, what will they complain about then? </p>

		<p>Quick! Someone call PETA!</p>
<p>People pushing this agenda need to go back to school and learn a little cultural anthropology because Indians have been guilty of the same crime(?) FOR MILLENNIA!</p>
<p>Anthropologists have a term, totemism, for naming yourself after some observable entity. A totem is &ldquo;an animal, plant, or natural object serving among certain tribal or traditional peoples as the EMBLEM of a clan or family and sometimes revered as its founder, ancestor, or guardian.&rdquo; (dictionary.com.) Thus, an Indian might call himself &#8220;Standing Bear&#8221; to tell the world he has all the desirable attributes (courage, strength, etc.) of a &#8220;standing bear.&#8221; Even the United States, a modern &ldquo;clan&rdquo;, has a totem: the eagle. Individual states have totems (flowers, animals, etc.) The purpose of a totem is to conjure up POSITIVE feelings in an observer.</p>
<p>Today, we have lost sight of the importance of a name. A name had a function in antiquity: it MADE PRESENT the reality of what that individual stood for, what he WAS. So a name was very important – an individual will BECOME what his name means. I don&rsquo;t think any Indian, unlike whites, ever took a name that meant nothing.</p>
<p>For an athletic team, the taking of a mascot name is the same: simply the use of a METAPHOR, a figure of speech in which a word or phrase literally denoting one entity or idea (e.g., Indians, animals) is applied to another (i.e., teams), thereby suggesting A LIKENESS or ANALOGY between them. By taking the name, they become the KEEPERS of the mascot&rsquo;s reputation. Note that this is actually the REVERSE (so what else is new?) of what the PC police CLAIM is happening (insults, discrimination, offense, etc.). Once more, liberals show they are &ldquo;ThOpp-ers&rdquo; – Think Opposite of what they say in order to get closer to truth.</p>
<p>Since the custom of taking a mascot name is an attempt to suggest a likeness between the team and its mascot, you will never encounter a team that calls itself the &#8220;Hamsters&#8221; or the &#8220;Butterflies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless there are third parties with big bucks driving the NCAA agenda (always a possibility), the inescapable conclusion is that those who would deny a team its name would deny the team its IDENTITY. Why would they want to do that? Simple. Because they can; and since all aspects of life, to the Leftists, is a class struggle, they must exert their power over whomever they can, in this case, innocuous athletic teams. And since the Left&rsquo;s agenda cannot win elections, there is no one or nothing remaining but the dog to go home and wage jihad against. Pretty small, wouldn&rsquo;t you think? George Will calls it &#8220;Chief among the silliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, may the next Trail of Tears be for Leftist liberals.<br>

		<p>If I understand this rather confusing piece, the Sioux themselves don&rsquo;t object to the name Fighting Sioux at all.  And why should they?  It honors them as the brave warriors they were, making a hopeless but courageous stand against the overwhelming and finally irresistible encroachments of the white man.</p>

		<p>My dad, a loyal grad of UND, will turn over in his grave about this. When I was a kid, my dad put me to bed with prayers and songs we would do together. My favorite &#8220;song&#8221; was the UND &#8220;fighting Sioux&#8221; sports chant (from the 1930s) which I think AmRen readers would appreciate  &mdash;   </p>
<p>Oh, the cannibal king<br>
with the big brass ring<br>
fell in love with a Zulu maid.<br>
And every night<br>
while the moon shown bright<br>
across the canal he would wade&hellip;<br>
To hug and kiss<br>
his dusky miss<br>
under a bamboo tree.<br>
Whenever they met<br>
they sang a duet<br>
that sounded like this to me&hellip;<br>
AY-ZIe-ZIe!<br>
RYE-RYE-RYE!<br>
HiYa! HiYa!<br>
North Dakota!<br>
WOOOWOOOOWOOOOOO !!<br>
(The last line was an old fashioned Indian war whoop, with your palm hitting your mouth over and over.)</p>
<p>Today my dad would probably be arrested by the thought police for passing on such a &#8220;raciss&#8221; chant to his children. He was a career Marine, many medals in WWII and Korea, including the Distinguished Flying Cross for bombing the hell out of the Chinese. I am so glad he died before he could wonder (like many of his generation) why he had sacrificed so much.</p>

		<p>DH once worked in a school where the mascot was a well-known indian tribe.  The school board declared this insensitive, racist and intolerable even though when the tribe was asked they indicated they had far bigger problems than worrying about whether some high school wanted to honor them with its image  &mdash;  mainly drug use, alcoholism and FAS, early deaths from violence, unemployment and high rates of  TB, mainly in their young.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t  matter, the school board demanded the immediate removal of the racist, offensive image.</p>
<p>This is in an age when procuring textbooks (in a non-Title I school) is difficult.</p>
<p>Lack of funds and budget shortfalls didn&rsquo;t matter.  The image representing White America&rsquo;s genocide against innocent, peaceful indians who worshiped natured  had to be smitten immediately.</p>
<p>Hoards of workmen (some privately contracted it looked like) descended upon the school  &mdash;  the new gym floor that hadn&rsquo;t quite set was scraped up and replaced,  any and all buildings with the hated image were sanded down and re-painted, all school stationary was tossed and replaced, the scoreboard was taken down, all band uniforms were ordered replaced  &mdash;  along with PE clothes, athletic team logos, book covers, everything had to go   &mdash;  any and all vestiges of the hated image were erased within a week.</p>
<p>Cost?  Who knows but it had to have been expensive, not to mention an utter waste of educational dollars.</p>
<p>PC trumps common sense, but then after all, when it&rsquo;s other people&rsquo;s money were talking about, what should the commies on school board care?</p>

		<p>So let them be forgotten.  Perhaps the Euro-Americans there can come up with something more reflective of their own heritage.  How about &#8220;The Fighting Christian Zealots?&#8221;  But if they import too many African Americans for their team, they might have to take on a name reflecting African heritage.  How about &#8220;The Fighting Zulus?&#8221;</p>
<p>Poster #1 is right, what were whites thinking when they retained tribal names for entire states?  In totalitarian regimes, all references to the old regime is destroyed, names, statues, even historical references, as the Roman Catholics did in Europe and the Soviet Bolsheviks later in the Russians.  </p>
<p>As I have written before, Amerinds are experts at shooting themselves in the foot.  Their hatred of whites is blind.</p>

<p>I agree. The United States Army has often named their helicopters after Indian tribes. And who would be in a better position to judge the martial qualities of those tribes? For a century or more,the words &#8220;Comanche&#8221; and &#8220;Apache&#8221; and &#8220;Kiowa&#8221; and  the like were names with which to conjure. There was a reason for that. Naming military equipment after those Indian tribes is a tribute and an honor to a foe that fought well,and fought to the bitter end.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see an attack helo called the AH-64 Gangbanger or AH-64 Homie,do you? There&rsquo;s a reason for that,too.</p>

<p>There is even a web server program named Apache.  Notice that the tribes who provide names for helicopters and mascots are, as you said, put up a good fight.  They may not have won, but at least we respect their effort and courage.  This is why the Army doesn&rsquo;t have any Pueblo helicopters, nor is there a web server program called Chippewa.</p>

<p>If that occurred, numerous civil rights marches would be held immediately to confront the &#8220;racism&#8221; associated with the use of a White nickname and the denial of the Sioux nickname.</p>
<p>I can hear it now? &#8220;What&rsquo;s up, cracker? Ain&rsquo;t the term &#8216;Sioux&rsquo; good enough for your White team? </p>
<p>We see this type of insanity routinely.</p>
<p>I recall a story from last year.</p>
<p>Black students were denied admission to college because they did not meet the minimum requirements. Charges of racism were leveled against the school. So, the school board backed down and waived the requirements. A short while later, as the Black students failed out of college, new charges of racism were level, accusing the school of predatory admissions. Remember that one?</p>
<p>This is no different.</p>
<p>In this case, some of the minorities leveled charges of racism against the school for using the term &#8220;Sioux&#8221;. Yet, if the school changed the nickname to &#8220;The Fighting Norsemen&#8221;, which would greatly please most Whites, new charges of racism would be leveled, accusing the school of not giving a fair chance to other groups, such as the Sioux.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable the way unintelligent minds work.</p>
