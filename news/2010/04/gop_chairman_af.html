<h1>GOP Chairman: African-Americans Not Given Good Reason to Vote for Party</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Abdon M. Pallasch, Chicago Sun-Times, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Why should an African-American vote Republican?</p>
<p>&#8220;You really don&rsquo;t have a reason to, to be honest  &mdash;  we haven&rsquo;t done a very good job of really giving you one. True? True,&#8221; Republican National Chairman Michael Steele told 200 DePaul University students Tuesday night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A week after his Democratic counterpart, Tim Kaine, told 200 activists at an Ethiopian Restaurant four miles away that the Tea Party movement was causing a &#8220;civil war&#8221; in the GOP that could help Democrats in November, Steele said he is telling Republicans around the country to work with the Tea Party activists to elect Republicans this fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have advised our state chairs: Don&rsquo;t turn your nose up, or turn away those who are active in the Tea Party movement. Embrace them. Welcome them. Talk to them,&#8221; Steele said. &#8220;Those activists have now become a very large part of our voting bloc. They represent a third or more of the voting age population, so they&rsquo;re going to have a profound impact on elections and in some cases in the primaries this November and this spring. Both parties had better pay attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have lost sight of the historic, integral link between the party and African-Americans,&#8221; Steele said. &#8220;This party was co-founded by blacks, among them Frederick Douglass. The Republican Party had a hand in forming the NAACP, and yet we have mistreated that relationship. People don&rsquo;t walk away from parties, Their parties walk away from them.</p>

		<p>Oh, us awful White people.  We actually want a party that will represent our own interests, just like the Democrats represent black interests.  How dare we?  We must all work harder to make the GOP even more of a clone of the Democratic Party than it already is.  Because&hellip;</p>

		<p>The old saying comes to mind, &#8220;With friends like this&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So what of the much-vaunted economic principles of the GOP? Those apply only to whites, not blacks? This is a repudiation of everything the GOP supposedly stands for.</p>
<p>But black rejection of the GOP is going to change now that Steele is chairman? In other words, he&rsquo;s arrogant as well as backstabbing? And the GOP elected this oaf?</p>
<p>it truly is the stupid party.</p>

		<p>The association of the Republican party with blacks is half a century out of date.  Bringing up Frederick Douglas is a century older than that.  </p>
<p>The parties traded places during the 20th century.  Of the 44 states that voted in the 1896 election, 36 voted for the OPPOSITE party in 2004.  </p>

The challenge for the Tea Party movement is whether it can make the Republican Party bend to their will or will the Republican Party co-opt and corrupt the Tea Party movement and destroy it in the process.</p>
<p>If the Tea Party movement keeps turning to established Republican speakers and politicians, the latter will turn out to be true and the movement will fade away.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;Why should an African-American vote Republican?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You really don&rsquo;t have a reason to, to be honest &mdash; we haven&rsquo;t done a very good job of really giving you one. True? True,&rsquo; Republican National Chairman Michael Steele told 200 DePaul University students Tuesday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The larger question is why should European Americans (or as I like to call them, Real Americans) vote for your party either?</p>
<p>We really don&rsquo;t have a reason to, to be honest &mdash; because it has never done a very good job of really giving us one. This is particularly true, when one considers its &ldquo;functions&rdquo; and fictions, since 1994.</p>
<p>What might these be?</p>
<p>For starters:</p>
<p>1.) That it actually gives a care or consideration to the survival of whites, that are their only base of support;</p>
<p>2.) That it isn&rsquo;t an imperialistic party of plutocrats and pigs, that only wants stolen white money and support to fund its cushy Trotskyite version of  Marxist &ldquo;global stability;&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.) Or, that a Michael Steele or a Bobby Jindal, really represent anything of value, beyond genocidal greed and diversity whoredom?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Imagine the CEO of IBM or G.E. saying, &#8220;&ldquo;&lsquo;Why should you buy our products/services? You really don&rsquo;t have a reason to, to be honest &mdash; we haven&rsquo;t done a very good job of really giving you one. True? True,&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Steele is a buffoon but the GOP is worse for making him the affirmative action king of The Stupid Party.</p>
<p>I hope the GOP gets beat in November and in 2012. They are terrible.</p>

		<p>Republican Steele almost got it right, the statement should be:</p>
<p>Why should Americans vote Republican?<br>
&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t have a reason to, to be honest &mdash; we haven&rsquo;t done a very good job of really giving you one. True? True,&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Republican party stands for nothing except electing Republicans. It is a political party without political goals. It&rsquo;s effect is to prevent any serious opposition to the Liberal agenda of the Democratic party. Love it or hate it, the Democratic party is a real political party, with real goals that it has been making an effort to achieve.</p>

		<p>So many reasons for a black person NOT to vote Republican.</p>
<p>Republicans believe in the free enterprise system. Blacks for the most part want the socialist state with guaranteed employment.</p>
<p>Republicans believe in individual rights. Blacks believe in group rights.</p>
<p>Republicans believe in rugged individualism. Blacks believe in the welfare state.</p>
<p>Republicans believe in civil discourse. Blacks are for &#8220;in your face&#8221; confrontational politics.</p>
<p>Etc. Blacks and the Republicans are JUST NOT compatible. Just a fact.</p>

		<p>The only black people who should vote Republican are the ones who believe in getting a good education, getting a good career, saving money, disciplining their kids, staying away from drugs and alcohol, and investing intelligently.  Oh, and they need to believe in working hard to better themselves.  Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe in the above shouldn&rsquo;t vote Republican.  That&rsquo;ll let out all the ghetto folks, the entitlement-consciousness people, and the lazy SOB&rsquo;s who want to lie around sucking the teat of the government, regardless of who&rsquo;s in charge.</p>

		<p>Interesting the the republicans are the party of lincoln and the blacks won&rsquo;t vote for them. So much for any idea of thankfulness on the part of blacks. As for steel, just another black guy carrying on a bit until he&rsquo;s shown the door.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think these poor slobs who&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re republicans are going to do one thing to help White people or this nation as a whole. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve long since crossed the Rubicon and the die is cast as far as how all this has to play out.</p>

		<p>Every election, it&rsquo;s the same old story. Ninety-nine percent of blacks vote for the Democrats. They&rsquo;ve been voting as a Democratic bloc for decades now and they always will, regardless of who&rsquo;s running. Always.</p>
<p>If the GOP is really basing its comeback strategy on appealing to blacks  &mdash;  if they really think they can get blacks to vote Republican in any significant number  &mdash;  then they deserve being called the Stupid Party.</p>
<p>But never mind the Republicans. It won&rsquo;t be long before they&rsquo;re completely irrelevant as a national party. Eight years of Bush destroyed their credibility and &#8220;demographic changes&#8221; are going to finish them off in the next ten or twenty years, maybe a lot sooner.</p>

		<p>A great many black people want a handout.  Aside from those that are flat out living on AFDC and food stamps, much of the black middle class has an affirmative action government job.  So naturally they favor the big government, pro-hand out party, the Democrats.  There&rsquo;s nothing Steele can do about that, other than turn the Republican Party into a clone of the Democratic Party, which no doubt is what he hopes to do.</p>
