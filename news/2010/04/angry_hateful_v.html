<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/apr/28/angry-hateful-violent-extremist-liberals/">Angry, Hateful, Violent, Extremist Liberals</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Times, April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Imagine a group of angry demonstrators toting swastika-festooned protest signs calling politicians Nazis, shouting obscenities and racial remarks and throwing rocks and bottles at police officers sent to keep order. No, these are not Tea Partiers. They are the mob that turned out last week to protest Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration-enforcement law. This group of liberal rowdies has been dubbed the Tequila Party.</p>
<p>{snip} Typical headlines described the protest as &#8220;mostly peaceful,&#8221; with media outlets avoiding details about why they had to use the qualifier &#8220;mostly.&#8221; Reporting a near-riot by the opponents of the Arizona law doesn&rsquo;t fit the dominant media storyline.</p>
<p>Some of the editorial bias is blatant. An Associated Press story about the Arizona immigration law quoted a 13-year-old Hispanic boy saying, &#8220;We can&rsquo;t be in the streets anymore without the pigs thinking we&rsquo;re illegal immigrants.&#8221; The Washington Post sanitized the boy&rsquo;s views towards law enforcement by replacing the word &#8220;pigs&#8221; with &#8220;[police].&#8221; If a Tea Partier used a slur of any kind, it&rsquo;s doubtful it would be given the square-bracket treatment. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} There was no press coverage, however, when supporters of illegal immigration used physical intimidation tactics and made threats of violence against demonstrators on the National Mall the same day.</p>
<p>At a Tea Party rally in Searchlight, Nev., on March 27, supporters of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid threw eggs at buses carrying attendees and later harassed and threatened some of them. The limited-government advocates at FreedomWorks have begun publicizing the hateful e-mail and voice messages they have received, as well as documenting other examples of angry leftist violence, intimidation and extremism.</p>
<p>The most press coverage on this effort to expose hateful liberal extremism came when voice-over actor Lance Baxter stupidly left a voice mail asking for &#8220;the percentage of people that are mentally retarded who are working for FreedomWorks.&#8221; As a result, he lost a high-profile gig with Geico insurance. Mr. Baxter&rsquo;s crime was his politically incorrect use of the word &#8220;retarded.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Tequila Party and gangsters like them represent the core and the pride of the liberal base. If an angry, shouting mob throwing bottles at police is the face of contemporary liberalism, it&rsquo;s no wonder Americans are turning against them in droves.<br>

		<p>Make no mistake about it.  These mestizos were worked into a violent frenzy mostly by none other than Obama himself whose lying, inflammatory rhetoric caused these people to riot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any other president that I&rsquo;m aware of has ever did the same in any situation, but rather always urged calm and caution.  That even the conservative talk show hosts and bloggers didn&rsquo;t pick up on this is curious to say the least.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very good chance that these people will resort to violent action when they protest, and will certainly do so if there is more fiery condemnation from the community organizer or his minions.</p>
<p>I think the very least that will occur is that we will again get to see the face of outlandish mestizo behavior from people who are illegal or from people who are no more than anti-white racists who want to bring in as many of their tribal kin as possible so they can steal our country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d utterly love to see them raise the Mex flag high over their heads and carry signs as in the past that demanded, &#8220;Whites!  Go back to Europe.&#8221;  But I think that&rsquo;s probably too much to hope for.</p>

		<p>In the late sixties the major networks presented wall-to-wall coverage of hippie demonstrators. But instead of spreading the left wing gospel it brought the Silent Majority to their feet and to the polls   &mdash;   and Nixon was elected. Now, all the guys in hard hats are Hispanics, unfortunately, but the white middle and working class still have clout, and by now they must realize that this is an existentialist battle they must win for their children. Otherwise, we are doomed to becoming a violent, crowded, second rate Latin American country. </p>

<p>I would say this kind of media coverup is simply outrageous, but since it&rsquo;s the same kind of coverup that&rsquo;s been going on for the past 40 years or so, all I can say is, &#8220;So what else is new?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Thus hateful type rhetoric comes as much from the federal, state and local governments as any place else, and it is outrageous in the amount of out and out lies that are told.</p>
<p>However, SPLC and ADL influence within various governments around the country are at the bottom of the misinformation and lies, with a great amount of assistance from the mainfringe media, but the danger of disiminating all these obfuscations and lies is that there could well be another Waco type incident by a government entity just as outrageous and unjust as before, and the links below indicate that another government debacle could very well occur.</p>
<p>But, let me first explain that the Prison Planet site (below)has mostly good but, not often, a bit of bad information, however, most of it is valid and can be supported with facts from other sources.  The site goes a bit astray from time to time with a kookie conspiracy theory, but I disregard those and pick up on only that news I can validate.  Judge Andrew Napolitano is a guest from time to time as are Gerald Celente and other high profile, mainstream figures, so the site does have a good measure of credibility.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the links.  It involves the same people that demonize white nationalists so badly&hellip;including the horrendous biased media especially.  Make your own decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Riot Police Sent to Intimidate Tea Party During Obama Event <br>
When the crowd didn&rsquo;t move and began singing &ldquo;God Bless, America&rdquo; and the national anthem, Quincy Deputy Police Chief Ron Dreyer called for members of the Mobile Field Force to walk up the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;U.S. Army Trains To Confront Tea Party &lsquo;Terrorists&rsquo; <br>
In a shocking development that outstrips even the infamous MIAC report, it has emerged via whistleblowers that the U.S. Military in Kentucky is training to confront Tea Party protesters and anti-government demonstrators, who in official intelligence advisories are described as bomb-making terrorists.&#8221;<br>

<p>When I was in school we had to learn about how striking workers were peaceful, and employers used violent &#8216;goons&rsquo;. I believe these were actually security guards hired to defend person and property from striking workers angry at the company. </p>

		<p>We know leftists will happily use death threats to prevent people from meeting to express points of view they don&rsquo;t like.  And we know the media (aside from Russia Today) will censor that fact.  Because leftist activists know they have the backing of the press, the universities, and the politicians they are emboldened to carry out far more frequent and extreme acts of intimidation, violence, and vandalism than any conservative would dare contemplate doing.  There will be nothing in the SPLC Intelligence report about the violence of the illegal immigrants and their backers.  But the SPLC will never tire of telling us that militias are a dire threat to the republic.</p>

		<p>While you get the occasional anarchist or gay riot,  most political violence for the left is carried out by non-whites. For example,  the racist prison rape of whites is a system maintained by the left to control the white population in general.    Republicans and establishment Conservatism have enabled leftist political/racial violence for decades, because it helped them get along with the media and their Democratic colleagues so they could cut money deals for their Big Business clients.   They helped to entrench the idea that leftist political violence, particularly when it is done by non-whites,  is a morally justified reaction to &#8220;oppression&#8221; by traditional white society.    The chickens are coming home to roost for the Republicans and the pseudo-Conservatives.   </p>

		<p>Americans have to wake up and realize the Media is not &#8220;biased&#8221;. It is deliberate Psychological Warfare waged against Americans.</p>
<p>Time and Newsweek are especially bad. Want to know what the Neo Marxists and Globalists want you think and feel&hellip;.just pick up a copy and scan through it. Does it have any relation to objective reality? Not a bit.  </p>

<p>And then Nixon increased the welfare state and entrenched the idea of affirmative action.  He also instituted wage and price controls and detached the dollar from Gold.  How did that all work out?</p>
