			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Jones, Guardian (London), April 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Race debate stirs after London-born star of The Wire wins role as Norse deity Heimdall in Kenneth Branagh&rsquo;s new film Thor</p>
<p>Even for an actor who has played a vampire-hunter with a guilty conscience, a Baltimore crime lord with a taste for Adam Smith, and an asset manager with a stalker, the role of the Norse deity Heimdall  &mdash;  guardian of the burning rainbow bridge between the world of men and the world of gods  &mdash;  was always going to be a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>But playing a god in Kenneth Branagh&rsquo;s forthcoming film Thor has turned out to be the least of Idris Elba&rsquo;s worries, after fans of the comic books turned on the star of The Wire for reasons that have nothing to do with his acting ability and everything to do with the colour of his skin.</p>
<p>When news emerged late last year that the 37-year-old black Londoner had been chosen to play Heimdall, &#8220;the whitest of the gods&#8221;, a being who can hear the sap flowing in trees and look across time and space, many devotees of the Marvel comics on which the film is based flocked to online forums to weep, gnash their teeth and unleash a tide of indignation.</p>
<p>A fortnight ago, the actor told Jonathan Ross that his take on Heimdall was &#8220;Norse by way of Hackney, Canning Town&#8221;. And at the beginning of the month, he told a press conference that he saw his casting as an encouraging step.</p>
<p>His view was not shared among the more vehement of the comic books&rsquo; fans. &#8220;This PC crap has gone too far!&#8221; wailed one. &#8220;Norse deities are not of an African ethnicity! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s the principle of the matter. It&rsquo;s about respecting the integrity of the source material, both comics and Norse mythologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fellow fans were quick to nod their horn-helmeted heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the risk of sounding like a bigot, I think this is nuts!&#8221; said another. &#8220;Asgard is home to the Norse Gods!!! Not too many un-fair complexion types roaming the frigid waste lands up there. I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to see many Brad Pitt types walking around in the [first mainstream black superhero] Black Panther&rsquo;s Wakanda Palace!&#8221;</p>
<p>Elba, who was born in Hackney, north-east London, to a Ghanaian mother and Sierra Leonean father, has addressed such concerns in a string of recent interviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a big debate about it: can a black man play a Nordic character?&#8221; he told TV Times. &#8220;Hang about, Thor&rsquo;s mythical, right? Thor has a hammer that flies to him when he clicks his fingers. That&rsquo;s OK, but the colour of my skin is wrong?</p>
<p>&#8220;I was cast in Thor and I&rsquo;m cast as a Nordic god,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you know anything about the Nords, they don&rsquo;t look like me but there you go. I think that&rsquo;s a sign of the times for the future. I think we will see multi-level casting. I think we will see that, and I think that&rsquo;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elba, who shot to fame as the erudite and thoughtful gangster Stringer Bell in critically acclaimed US television serial The Wire, also used his interview with TV Times to warn viewers against pigeonholing his new BBC crime drama, Luther, just because it was about a black policeman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&rsquo;ll put ourselves in a corner if we just describe Luther as a black detective,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There haven&rsquo;t been many in the past, but the fact that he&rsquo;s black is neither here nor there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actor added that while it was &#8220;great to have a character who happens to be black in the central position .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he still bleeds, just like anyone else&#8221;.</p>
<p>Elba is working in the US and was unavailable for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>However, his publicist flatly dismissed any suggestion of a row between fans and film-makers, telling the Guardian that the actor was merely being mischievous. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no controversy,&#8221; said Rupert Fowler. &#8220;Idris was being flippant in the [TV Times] interview.&#8221;</p>
<p>His UK agent, Roger Charteris, said Elba had chosen the role of Heimdall on artistic rather than political grounds. &#8220;He just wanted to do the movie and work with Kenneth Branagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;He liked the script and he liked the movie and he had always wanted to work with Kenneth Branagh. It wasn&rsquo;t like a statement: &#8216;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to do this.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s always a purely creative decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or perhaps Elba was seeking to emulate his fellow British actor and Wire costar Dominic West. Last year, West  &mdash;  who has played the Ukrainian-Russian son of Pablo Picasso, a Spartan statesman and a French detective  &mdash;  revealed he had decided to accept the part of the Australian scientist Professor Howard Florey in a BBC TV drama about the discovery of penicillin, in protest against non-English actors playing famous English roles. &#8220;I was sort of smarting from Russell Crowe coming over here and playing Robin Hood and all these foreigners coming over here and stealing our great heroes,&#8221; he said, his tongue lodged firmly in his cheek. &#8220;I felt I was striking a blow back by being a Brit playing a foreigner.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s up to the casting director and producers to decide who is suitable for a role. It is not actually illegal to discriminate for authenticity purposes in the theatre. There is an exception under the Race Relations Act which says if it is required for the role, you can ask for someone of a certain colour.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Colour-blind casting: how cinema has lagged behind the stage</b></p>
<p>Idris Elba is not the first black British actor to play a Scandinavian icon. In 2001, Adrian Lester played Hamlet in Paris, receiving rave reviews for his portrayal of the melancholy Dane in Peter Brook&rsquo;s stripped-down production.</p>
<p>In the same year, David Oyelowo became the first black actor in the Royal Shakespeare Company&rsquo;s history to be cast in the role of an English monarch when he played Henry&nbsp;VI in Histories.</p>
<p>In 2002, colour-blind casting came to Noël Coward when Chiwetel Ejiofor played Nicky Lancaster in The Vortex at the Donmar Warehouse.</p>
<p>Lester, who played the lead role in Nicholas Hytner&rsquo;s satirical updating of Henry&nbsp;V in 2003, also joined the cast of the first all-black Broadway production of Cat On a Hot Tin Roof. Debbie Allen&rsquo;s take on Tennessee Williams&rsquo;s play, which opened in New York in 2008, starred James Earl Jones as Big Daddy and Phylicia Rash®°d as Big Mama. It transferred to the West End last November, with Lester as Brick, who was played in the 1958 film by Paul Newman.</p>
<p>Although the tradition of white actors such as Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles &#8220;blacking up&#8221; to play Othello has all but disappeared, gentile actors  &mdash;  such as Al Pacino  &mdash;  still routinely play Shylock in Shakespeare&rsquo;s The Merchant of Venice.</p>
<p>Cinema, which is far less reliant on existing, classic material, has lagged behind theatre when it comes to colour-blind casting.</p>
<p>Rumours of a black James Bond remain just that, although his CIA friend Felix Leiter has been played by two African-American actors, Bernie Casey in 1983&rsquo;s Never Say Never Again, and Jeffrey Wright in the Daniel Craig films Casino Royale (2006) and Quantum of Solace (2008).</p>
<p>In 1999, another originally white US lawman, Captain James West, was played by Will Smith in Wild Wild West, which also starred Kenneth Branagh.</p>

		<p>Kenneth Brannagh likes the arts, but like many artists, shows distain for real life.  He played noble English leaders (despite being born Irish), yet turned down an appointment to the Order of the British Empire.</p>
<p>In the same vein as his casting a black to play a white, Branagh&rsquo;s ex-wife Emma Thompson adopted a 16 year old Rwandan African so she could put him through the English school system.  She was heard to complain there weren&rsquo;t enough blacks in the boy&rsquo;s school.</p>

		<p>One to boycott then, thank you for the forewarning AmRen. This really irks me because it&rsquo;s a denial of the integral value of Norse mythology: that it was a culture bound to those who originated it. This attempt to &#8216;universalise&rsquo; it really robs the mythology of its intrinsic value: it denies the value of the concept of &#8216;volk&rsquo; and thus of a people&rsquo;s transcendent myths and traditions. Something disconnected from its origins and capable of being appropriated by anyone is ultimately meaningless.</p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t much of a Thor reader back when I was a kid. His &#8220;yeah thou art&#8221; dialogue was too much for a kid honing his reading skills. I watched his old cartoons instead. </p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t have a problem with the occasional nonwhite in Asgard, I do have a problem with a well known ancient god like Heimdall being portrayed as a nonwhite. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with Idris Elba portraying an Asgardian god, but just not Heimdall. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already turned formerly white characters Nick Fury and Alicia Masters (Fantastic Four Thing&rsquo;s girlfriend)black, and they turned the Fantastic Four&rsquo;s Invisible Woman into a half Mexican. Whose next, making the Black Panther a white guy?</p>

		<p>I would like to see the reaction from non-whites if Paul Bettany or Stellan Skarsgaard landed the role of Malcolm X,or even if Al Pacino was cast as Othello.The comic book stories themselves were a trivialisation of the great northern myths,but this film is a deliberate insult and will hopefully be shunned.</p>

		<p>  Do you remember the demands of Black Power groups that demand that all civilization was developed by blacks and stolen by whites and orientals ? This is intended to be more &#8220;in your face&#8221; diversity like the immigrantion into the US,UK and other countries that demands that the whites change to accomodate the non-white immigrants.<br>
  If the film is produced no one should go to see it and whites should sue, demonstrate, clog complaint lines for actors unions and politicians until its distribution is stopped as racist.<br>
  Whites need to return the same objections to all the PC (is politically correct communism - just look up what communism wanted to force upon everyone to remake the world and compare it yourselves) and racists black,hispanic, hindu, muslim or whatever need to have the same claims they make used against them by whites. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good to know this casting choice ahead of time. Now I will definitely not watch this garbage. The decision to have a black Heimdall is a deliberate insult to Whites. This reminds me of a BBC miniseries on the quest for the Golden Fleece. One of the Argonauts was Narcissus played by some ugly black actor. Traditionally Narcissus was portrayed as a red-haired Thracian, but the multiculties at the BBC were inspired by the old film &#8216;Black Narcissus&rsquo; to make the demigod an African. <br>
I wonder if we&rsquo;ll ever have our culture back? I&rsquo;m sad and pessimistic about it. </p>

<p>Thor&rsquo;s hammer flies in the myths, so it makes sense that it flies in the movie, too.  Heimdall&rsquo;s the whitest of a white pantheon, so it makes no sense at all that Heimdall is black in the movie.</p>
<p>But grade-school-level logic aside, these are white myths.  That&rsquo;s the only reason whites are interested in paying to watch them on the big screen.  If Hollywood want black gods, they should make a movie about a black mythos.  See how many tickets they sell then.  They don&rsquo;t get to have their cake and eat it too, exploit our myths for profit then corrupt them for diversity&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll put ourselves in a corner if we just describe Luther as a black detective,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There haven&rsquo;t been many in the past, but the fact that he&rsquo;s black is neither here nor there.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Nonsense.  This is an actor being thrust into ludicrous roles for the sake of diversity, telling us his &#8220;diversity&#8221; is meaningless.  Can&rsquo;t have it both ways; either you&rsquo;re an AA hire, or you aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><i>The actor added that while it was &ldquo;great to have a character who happens to be black in the central position &hellip; he still bleeds, just like anyone else&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>All mammals fit that description.</p>
<p><i>His UK agent, Roger Charteris, said Elba had chosen the role of Heimdall on artistic rather than political grounds. &ldquo;He just wanted to do the movie and work with Kenneth Branagh.</i></p>
<p>His presence fails on artistic, more than political, grounds.</p>
<p><i>The Equality and Human Rights Commission said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to the casting director and producers to decide who is suitable for a role. It is not actually illegal to discriminate for authenticity purposes in the theatre. There is an exception under the Race Relations Act which says if it is required for the role, you can ask for someone of a certain colour.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Neat how the entertainment industry gets a pass from the stuff they push on everyone else, isn&rsquo;t it?  There&rsquo;s something similar going on in America, though I&rsquo;ll be damned if I can find anything concrete online about it.</p>
<p><i>In the same year, David Oyelowo became the first black actor in the Royal Shakespeare Company&rsquo;s history to be cast in the role of an English monarch when he played Henry VI in Histories.</i></p>
<p>In 2002, colour-blind casting came to Noël Coward when Chiwetel Ejiofor played Nicky Lancaster in The Vortex at the Donmar Warehouse.</p>

<p>Notice how they cite several examples of blacks poaching roles of white historical and mythological figures, but give no examples of whites playing black historical or mythological figures.</p>
<p>Anyone else heard the uproar among the fans over M. Night Shyamalan&rsquo;s <i>Airbender</i>?  Fans are incensed over the decision in that production to cast quasi-Asian <b>cartoon characters</b> as Europeans in the film.  You don&rsquo;t hear any cries of bigotry or racism against those fans.</p>
<p><i>Rumours of a black James Bond remain just that, although his CIA friend Felix Leiter has been played by two African-American actors, Bernie Casey in 1983&rsquo;s Never Say Never Again, and Jeffrey Wright in the Daniel Craig films Casino Royale (2006) and Quantum of Solace (2008).</i></p>
<p>Jeffrey Wright&rsquo;s about as black as Obama, that is, about half.  He could almost pass for an Arab.  And whites in general don&rsquo;t buy tickets to Bond films to see Felix Leiter.  They buy tickets to see Bond.  If Bond is ever black, prepare for a flop, or at the very least, a dramatic drop in ticket sales.</p>
<p><i>In 1999, another originally white US lawman, Captain James West, was played by Will Smith in Wild Wild West, which also starred Kenneth Branagh.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not angered by what Hollywood does with its own silly properties as I am by what it does with my heritage.  If Branagh wants to demean himself as the sexually impotent, crippled blond villain to the potent black hero with white sidekick in tow, let him.  Jim West is Hollywood&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p>The Norse mythos is not.  Goodbye theater, goodbye DVD sale, hello Netflix.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to admire Branagh, but no more benefit-of-the-doubt for this cultural marxist  &mdash;  and I refrain from saying what he deserves to be called in his local pub, out of respect for this forum.</p>
<p>As always, flip the polarity  &mdash;  think Kunte Kinte or Malcolm X played by, oh, <i> Tom Cruise</i>. Just think about that&hellip;</p>
<p> OK with you, Mr. Elba? Mr. Branagh? I&rsquo;m so sure &#8216;you be down with that&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lest we forget: writer of the column Sam Jones is happy to make fun of whites like this: &#8220;Fellow fans were quick to nod their horn-helmeted heads.&#8221; Was Mr. Elba &#8220;shaking his corn-rowed head&#8221; in response? Gee, I wonder. But he sure looks dumb in that helmet. And the T-shirt tells me all I need to know.</p>

		<p>This has been going on for years.  Othello is usually portrayed by a black actor when the character was actually a Moor.  The Moors were essentially an Arabic peoples, not black Sub-Saharan African.</p>
<p>The Discovery channel has started portraying ancient Egyptians as black Sub-Saharan Africans.  I have even seen shows where the Egyptologists are examining an obviously non-black mummy but when they do a reenactment of the mummy&rsquo;s life he is portrayed as black.</p>
<p>Pretty soon Emperor Chin and even the little green men from Mars will be portrayed as black.<br>

		<p>Does Kenneth Branagh really think that hysterical laughter will not erupt at the entrance of his black Norse god?</p>
<p>It is too ridiculous, too ridiculous.  I once thought that Mr. Branagh was an asset to white cultre, after his release of Henry V.  But clearly, he has caught the white elitist entertainer disease - WEED.  He probably smokes too much of it.</p>

		<p>Branagh did this to please his Masters, the people who run the entertainment industry, most of whom are anti-White and anti-West to the core. In fact, the way casting is actually done for most films, the decision to cast a black male in the role was quite likely decided long ago. Then Branagh and crew went through the motions. What people don&rsquo;t realize is that 90% of all TV and film auditions are to satisfy union rules. Most of the time, the major roles and middling roles have already been granted to someone&rsquo;s nephew, son, friend, whatever. Actors hate to hear this, but it&rsquo;s a fact. To keep the unions from raising hell, the auditions are held to make it appear as if the production company or studio is actually looking for an unknown. That&rsquo;s actually very rare. It happens, but rarely. </p>

		<p>What if a new version of the TV series &#8220;Roots&#8221; came out, with exactly the same name and media hype but this time with all white actors and telling the story of white slavery down through the ages. How would blacks and liberal writers respond to that?</p>
<p>I remember reading about a row caused by blacks when white dancers won a dance contest involving a form of dance originated by blacks. The blacks claimed this was &#8220;cultural theft&#8221; and, as i recall, the dance committee was forced to award a joint prize to include black dance teams as well. I think the term &#8220;cultural theft&#8221; is a good one and apropos in the case of black actors appropriating formerly white film roles.</p>
<p>I would name some black legends that blacks would be outraged if whites appropriated, but the fact is that blacks have created no enduring legends or memorable fictional characters for whites to appropriate. The &#8220;cultural theft&#8221; is entirely one way.</p>

		<p>Oh, for the love of&hellip;look, I loved The Wire and I think Idris Elba&rsquo;s a fine actor, but enough with the social engineering already, all right? James Bond, the guy from &#8220;The Wild, Wild West&#8221;? Fine, cast Gary Coleman for all I care. I thought Todd Haynes&rsquo; casting several actors, including a woman and a small Black child, in the Bob Dylan role in &#8220;I&rsquo;m Not There&#8221; was brilliant. But I&rsquo;m with V and Oldman here, this is just deliberate &#8220;in your face&#8221; provocation. The Norse Gods may have long ago passed into mythology, but still, I&rsquo;m sure, resonate with the people of the region as a part of their cultural history and should thus be accorded some respect, even if it is just a comic book retelling. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to love the whole &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t like it you&rsquo;re a <i>racist</i>&#8221; aspect, too. What if they cast Betty White instead? If I objected would that mean I hate little old ladies? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not against actors beased on their color.  I see movies with people of all races.  But I am a purist when it comes to ancient history and mythology.  Can you imagine going to a movie about Shaka Zulu, and seeing him or one of his love interests played by a white person?  It would be too incongruous and your brain would be shouting that this is not real history.</p>
<p>I am saddened at the choice of a black to play a very white god from white european mythology.  I am sad because I would in fact normally go to see such a film, but because of the incongruous nature of the casting, I will not be able to see this film with a clear mind.  My brain would not be able to stay within the fantasy of the film when it is jarred by an obvious historical error in who the people (or gods) involved were.</p>

		<p>The movie might be worth seeing if they are smart enough to use makeup to narrow his nose and make him white skinned.  Separating the behavioral nuances  of blacks from the appearance of blacks will be a good thing for people to see. It will strengthen race realism. Maybe the left is so against the use of blackface because it causes people to notice that even when the skin differences are removed there are still other drastic differences between the bodies and the behavior of blacks and whites.</p>

		<p>I follow the Gods of the North. I am not a Christian. That being said, it should be remembered by all that Tuesday is named for Tyr, the Norse god of war and law. Wednesday is named for Odin, king of the gods. Thursday is named for Thor, god of thunder and the protector of man. Friday is named for Frigg, the queen of the gods. The naming of this black actor to the role of Thor is like naming Jack Black to the role of Martin Luther King. The affront to all of us who honor the Gods of the North is beyond description. When Kenneth Branagh must cross the bridge to Asgaard, it will not be a black actor that blocks his way to the Great Hall, but a red-haired, red bearded, white god. Mr Branagh, and any who have a hand in this sacrilege, prepare to be cast out, and spend your eternity with Hel, the goddess of Hell ( another name with a Norse, not Christian origin . </p>

		<p>Frankly, I am not as upset by the injecting of a black into a white myth, nearly as much as I am at the daily injecting of the myth that blacks are a benefit to society when in fact they are nothing but a curse on any society that accepts them, and injecting this myth into our reality day after day after day.  The injecting of this opportunist black into a movie about a white myth causes no real harm.  Folks just won&rsquo;t pay to see it.<br>
The injecting of the myth that blacks are NOT a curse, but are beneficial, into our everyday reality causes GREAT HARM.  It brainwashes our white kids, so they become easier victims, or foolishly try to emulate blacks.  It forces folks to quash their innate and natural fear and aversion to evil and danger walking amongst us.  It drains our taxes trying to make the innately uncivilized and violent into civilized and peaceful citizens.  In the one case, we can avoid the theaters.  In the other case, we cannot avoid the extremely dangerous playground the multi-cults have imposed upon us.  We have NO choice but to pass through it, at risk, day after day.</p>

In fact, fact, the Berbers are understood to have absorbed a great deal of Celtic genetics.

<p>You may not look or feel you look Norse enough to play such a part, but you may not know that Sicily was conquered by the Normans.</p>
<p>below;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the 11th century, mainland southern Italian powers hired Norman mercenaries, who conquered Sicily from the Arabs under Roger I.[28] After taking Apulia and Calabria, he occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger was victorious at Misilmeri, but the most crucial battle was the siege of Palermo, which in 1072 led to Sicily coming under Norman control.[30]</p>
<p> Kingdom of Sicily<br>
Main articles: Kingdom of Sicily and List of monarchs of Sicily<br>
 <br>
The Cathedral of Monreale <br>
One of the towers of the Cathedral of MonrealePalermo continued on as the capital under the Normans. Roger&rsquo;s son, Roger II of Sicily, was ultimately able to raise the status of the island to a kingdom in 1130, along with his other holdings which included the Duchy of Apulia and Calabria and the Maltese Islands.[30][31] During this period the Kingdom of Sicily was prosperous and politically powerful, becoming one of the wealthiest states in all of Europe; even wealthier than England.[32]</p>
<p>Significantly, immigrants from Northern Italy and Campania arrived during this period. Linguistically, the island became Latinised. In terms of church, it would become completely Roman Catholic; previously, under the Byzantines, it had been more Eastern Christian.[33]</p>
<p> <br>
Depiction of the Sicilian VespersAfter a century the Norman Hauteville dynasty died out, the last direct descendent and heir of Roger; Constance married Emperor Henry VI.[34] This eventually led to the crown of Sicily been passed on to the Hohenstaufen Dynasty who were Germans from Swabia. Conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy, led in 1266 to Pope Innocent IV crowning Angevin Dynasty duke Charles I as the king of both Sicily and Naples.&#8221;</p>
<p>Observation, I have seen a few tv clips (which I turned off imediately) of that dumb reality show where Swedish beauty Brigit Neilsen portrays herself as the lover of rapper &#8220;Flava, Flav, who was always - along with his dumb, gigantic timepiece, bling watch, wore a horned Viking helmet.  (Vikings actually never used cow horns on their headgear).</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that Carthage  [i.e.North Africa] was allied with the Celts of Spain and Gaul (France), and  Hannibal invaded Italy through this route. Many or probably most of Hannibal&rsquo;s troops would have been Celts.  This is understandable, as an expansive Rome  had been engaged in a war of annihilation against the Celts that went on for several centuries. Originally, all of northern Italy  (&#8220;Cisalpine Gaul&#8221;) was Celtic.  Genetically, much of it still is. The Celts were slowly conquered and reduced to slavery, but their genes survived.</p>
<p>As for North Africa (i.e. Carthage) after Rome, it was later invaded by the Vandals, a Germanic tribe of Scandinavian origin,  who settled and remained there.</p>

<p>Roger II, the half-Norman, half-Ligurian founder of the Kingdom of Sicily, is one of my favorite historical figures.  His biography makes for fascinating reading.  I highly recommend it!</p>

<p><br>
YOU may not know this, but even to this day he is fondly remembered by many historians and history buffs on the island of Sicily.  His reign is considered a &#8220;golden age&#8221;.  The Hohenstaufen dynasty that followed was but a pale imitation, and Angevin rule was an unmitigated disaster! (Hence, the Vespers)</p>
<p>Your little factoid on the history of Sicily (which by the way, has nothing to do with the subject matter of this thread) doesn&rsquo;t deter from my contention that getting anyone other than a Scandinavian (or someone who LOOKS like a Scandinavian) to play Heimdall in a movie is meant to be a slap in the face to people of Scandinavian heritage.<br>

<p>It is an insult, no doubt about that.  The Norse Gods were NOT african blacks, none of them.  If they made a movie about african gods does anyone think the blacks would be ok with them making some of them White?  Please.  I for one am sick of this intrusion into our history and myths by blacks.  Who the hell do they think they are?</p>

		<p>Interesting comments here about the &#8220;Normans&#8221; in Sicily. <br>
Please allow me to add this little  &#8220;factoid&#8221;.   </p>
<p>The Normans, grandsons of Vikings who settled in France, were a very aggressive and warlike bunch, still quite unruly and &#8220;uncivilized&#8221; by Christian standards. They only grudgingly accepted the suzereignty of the French king, but pretty much ignored him otherwise. Even before the conquest of England they had been engaged in such warlike activities as training and selling warhorses and renting themselves out as mercenaries around Europe. So they were well acquainted with the arts of war, and prepared to take advantage of what opportunities they found.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they were only a few, and after the conquest of England   &mdash;   a kingdom much larger than little Normandy   &mdash;    every Norman was outnumbered by a great number of Anglo-Saxon subjects. (Then, after subduing England, they advanced into Ireland and Wales too.)</p>
<p>Therefore, the Norman conquest of Sicily (and Southern Italy   &mdash;   and extending all the way to Cyprus and the Levant) was called &#8220;Norman&#8221;  because of the French-speaking lords who lived in the castle and ruled it. But they were never numerous [rather like the Spaniards in Mexico]; and for every Norman lord or knight, they would have been accompanied by hundreds of Anglo-Saxon footsoldiers, retainers, servants who did the actual work  (but didn&rsquo;t get the credit). </p>

		<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Black American and I&rsquo;m insulted a bit by this casting. Of course, biased as a Black man, here are certain roles that I think could be toyed with and given to various races (especially in comic books/movies based on comics where there are alternate universes or multiple heroes that bear the same name, such as the Green Lantern). In this case, however, I believe that this is a bad decision. To be honest, few Blacks will probably go to see this movie. There is no point to casting a Black actor in this role, and they&rsquo;ll end up alienating the people that would be most interested in seeing this movie, thus losing profit.</p>
<p>As a regular (well, maybe not regular by statistics or what many people on this site might say) Black guy that dabbles a bit in story-writing myself,  I can assure you that I did not call for this casting decision, and I would not be upset to see Thor played by a Nordic-type White man (as he should be). I would be dreadfully upset if one of my stories were ever released in the mainstream and important main characters had their races (or appearances, characteristics, etc.) changed.</p>

Beats me. I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how The Beast became blue and furry.</p>
<p>And a black Kingpin? He&rsquo;s supposed to look like King Kong Bundy or Butterbean.<br>

		<p>That Hollywood is, for the most part gratuitously stupid is not exactly news.  I recall the movie &#8220;Dune&#8221; which seemed to have some promise, as I greatly enjoyed the books.  What a disappointment!  The producers eliminated the entire &#8220;Bene Gesserit&#8221; religion from the story line - which had been the core plot element in the books - and replaced it with a module that strapped to one&rsquo;s arm that blew things up.  A truly excrable adaptation of a good novel.</p>
<p>If the same morons had produced &#8220;Star Wars&#8221;, they would have dropped that whole pesky &#8220;Jedi Knights&#8221; and &#8220;Force&#8221; thing, and replaced it with a module that strapped to people&rsquo;s arms that blew things up.</p>
<p>Good work from Hollywood is like the proverbial blushes on a prostitute&rsquo;s cheeks; rare, and nice to see, but not to be depended on.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is an insult, no doubt about that. &hellip; I for one am sick of this intrusion into our history and myths by blacks. Who the hell do they think they are?&#8221;     &mdash;   Reality</p>
<p>&#8220;As a regular Black guy who dabbles a bit in story-writing myself, I can assure you that I did not call for this casting decision&#8221;     &mdash;  - Amateur<br>

<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t blame black people for this. It wasn&rsquo;t their doing.  This type of casting decision was made by other people, not blacks, who are imposing this on the public for IDEOLOGICAL purposes of their own. </p>
<p>Of all the excellent comments here, I think that #16 (NotSurprised) hit the nail most perfectly on the head.</p>

		<p>Looks like Idris Elba will NOT be playing Thor after all - the role has gone to Chris Hemsworth, the white, fair haired actor who played Captain James T Kirk in the last Star Trek movie. </p>
<p>While I personally think he&rsquo;s too wimpy to play the mighty Thor, at least he&rsquo;s white. Perhaps the howl of protests from white comic book fans changed the minds of Disney and Marvel? </p>
<p>Hail Thor! </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know anything about Chris Hemsworth,  but this  looks more like a Thor to me.   A vast improvement! <br>

		<p>Ever notice all the flurry of Australian actors lately?</p>
<p>How sad that Britain has to go all the way to Australia to find white actors nowadays!  What silent comment does that say about the state of the mother country?</p>
<p>Even Hollywood has to go fishing in Australia to find good-looking, articulate, white actors anymore.  What does that say about the USA?  </p>
<p>Where will they go when the gene pool in Australia dries up?  Iceland? Patagonia?</p>

		<p>In response to how Nick Fury is black in the Marvel Comics universe<br>
Marvel has a line of comics called &#8220;The Ultimates&#8221; which are<br>
based in a parallel universe to the main Marvel Universe where<br>
some things are the same and others are different. The black Nick Fury character which was actually created based with Samuel Jackson as the physical model is one of the differences. The funny thing is that the character also resembles Samuel Jackson&rsquo;s role in the Triple X series with the eyepatch. </p>

		<p>What the heck is this?</p>
<p>Thor moves to the ghetto?</p>
<p>This is so stupid, that movie will probably be a major flop, and forgotten in a year or so&hellip;</p>
<p>But I am very much disappointed, because I thought kenneth Branagh catually had a working brain, and both artistic and personnal integrity.</p>

		<p>I (once) thought Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson were wonderfully talented actors.   </p>
<p>Whatever were the marital differences that broke them up, it obviously couldn&rsquo;t have been any difference over politics!<br>
They&rsquo;re both in complete lockstep with the far Left.  </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the price of having a career in the movies   &mdash;   even more so in Britain than in Hollywood. If you don&rsquo;t toe the line, you don&rsquo;t get the jobs.</p>
