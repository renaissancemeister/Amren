<h1><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-dyehudson041210">Hudson Hints at Racism for Blacks in Free Agency</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Passan, Yahoo! Sports, April 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As Major League Baseball prepares for its annual Jackie Robinson Day on Thursday, one prominent African-American player questioned teams&rsquo; commitment to employing black players past their prime years.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see guys like Jermaine Dye without a job,&#8221; Minnesota Twins second baseman Orlando Hudson said Monday. &#8220;Guy with [27 home runs and 81 RBIs] and can&rsquo;t get a job. Pretty much sums it up right there, no? You&rsquo;ve got some guys who miss a year who can come back and get $5, $6 million, and a guy like Jermaine Dye can&rsquo;t get a job. A guy like Gary Sheffield, a first-ballot Hall of Famer, can&rsquo;t get a job.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both know what it is. You&rsquo;ll get it right. You&rsquo;ll figure it out. I&rsquo;m not gonna say it because then I&rsquo;ll be in [trouble].&#8221;</p>
<p>What Hudson wants to say: He believes there is a racist element to the free-agent market in baseball, and that it&rsquo;s paralyzing the 36-year-old Dye&rsquo;s ability to earn what non-blacks with commensurate numbers received in the offseason.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hudson&rsquo;s comments came on the heels of Dye turning down a one-year contract offer from the Washington Nationals for less than a quarter of his $11.5 million salary with the Chicago White Sox last season. After a first half in which he slugged .567 and hit 20 home runs, Dye spent the second half of 2009 in a deep slump from which he never emerged, batting .179 and slugging .297 while playing subpar defense in right field.</p>
<p>Hudson believed Dye&rsquo;s credentials  &mdash;  164 home runs in the last five years and an OPS 21 percent better than the league average  &mdash;  would buy him the benefit of the doubt. Dye hoped to play for a contender, and while he understood he would take a pay cut, he expected a deal in the $4 million-plus range. Hudson said he and Dye spoke on the phone this offseason about his status, though they never broached specifics about why the market never materialized above $3.5 million, a number approached or exceeded by a number of players with inferior credentials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Baltimore Orioles guaranteed $4.5 million to first baseman Garrett Atkins, 30, after he hit .226 and slugged .342 in 354 at-bats last season. Thirty-three-year-old Aubrey Huff&rsquo;s on-base percentage was 30 points lower than Dye&rsquo;s and his slugging percentage 69 points lower, yet the San Francisco Giants gave him $3 million. The Chicago Cubs paid 31-year-old Xavier Nady $3.3 million after an elbow injury limited him to 28 at-bats last season.</p>
<p>Whether teams with first base openings didn&rsquo;t trust Dye&rsquo;s ability to convert or others with outfield slots preferred different players, his presence on the open market in mid-April is particularly puzzling when coupled with the fates of other black players.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are other factors, of course. The free-agent market has shifted drastically against older players. The game places a greater emphasis on defense. And in the individual cases, Lofton came with a difficult-to-handle reputation, as did Sheffield, who once alluded to possible racism from his manager with the New York Yankees, Joe Torre  &mdash;  an accusation backed up by Lofton.</p>
<p>Never has Dye been lumped among the malcontents, and his case lends credence to a belief among some black baseball players that should frighten MLB: They&rsquo;re treated differently. True or not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The specter of racism in a game still haunted by its history  &mdash;  and trying to rejuvenate itself among black youth  &mdash;  is a disturbing reality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps Hudson&rsquo;s stake is personal. Two years ago, he entered free agency seeking a multiyear deal. He ended up taking an incentive-loaded $3.4 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. This season, the 32-year-old hoped for multiple years again. He signed with Minnesota for $5 million over one year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So as players receive their special jerseys this week with the No. 42 on the back and the sport celebrates Robinson breaking the color line, baseball will examine itself again and wonder how it can change a perception that is now six decades old and seems to be going nowhere.<br/>

		<p>Orlando Hudson should buy a team.  He can then pay his bruthas whatever he wants to.  Until then, Orlando, you are an employee and you should keep your mouf shut.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s another factor too, not just for older blacks, but also for older whites and older everyone else   &mdash;   Since the enactment of the COMPETE Act several years ago, which allowed for unlimited visas for professional athletes and &#8220;prospects,&#8221; there is now a glut of Afro- or mulatto- Hispanic Caribbeans in the minor leagues, working far cheaper than white or black American natives would want, and ready to bust into the majors.  Most of them will make at or not very much more than league minimum. </p>

		<p>Anybody here watch baseball in April? It is a great game &#8220;on paper&#8221; but the 4 hour length of most games makes it unwatchable. Add to that the fact that a fourth of the players are aliens who don&rsquo;t speak English, and there is little of interest. Most teams would be bankrupt without TV contracts, and most TV networks are bankrupt, too. There is a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; coming in pro sports, based on the recession, low TV ratings, and owner greed as witnessed by the &#8220;personal seat license&#8221; for season tickets. Without his contract, Hudson would be lucky to work in a Nike sweatshop.  </p>

		<p>Waaaaaaahhh!  I only make $3 million per job while all the whites (allegedly) make a teeny, itsy bit more. I&rsquo;m such a victim.  Please cry for me, donate more money to the anti-racism fund, and to another worthless black organization that hates whites and the US but will gladly take our money.</p>

		<p>I agree with Hudson, it is racism.  So what?  Characteristics other than skin color are associated with blacks.  Characteristics that don&rsquo;t go well with team play or hustle.  While the black man thinks it&rsquo;s the skin color, the white man knows it&rsquo;s the afrotude.  When whites were forced to treat blacks like they were equal (when they aren&rsquo;t) blacks got a chip on their shoulder and decided to stick it to whites by seeing how much they could misbehave and force whites to tolerate - knowing they had Uncle Sambo to drop the hammer on any uppity whites not wanting to put up with it. I absolutely refuse to put up with afrotude.  Act white or hit the road.</p>

		<p>.242 hitters who can&rsquo;t play first rate defense should be coaching minor league or college teams, assuming they have a brain. Not all baseball players, black, white or brown, have a brain.</p>

		<p>Note that nowhere in the article does Passan consider the huge influx of imported Hispanics into baseball. From what I have read on the internet, this influx has had a negative effect on all American baseball players. </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t all aggrieved black ballplayers go on indefinite strike?</p>
<p>Surely withholding their services for a season or two would teach baseball fans a lesson in remuneration justice.  Or even better, let&rsquo;s have a new form of double-A ball, the African American League, which could showcase the skills of black ballplayers, capped with a World Series between the all-white league leaders and the double-A players.</p>

		<p>I thought the best player&rsquo;s make the team.  Its not suppose to be about racism.  So your telling me in 2010 that white player have more opportunies them black player&rsquo;s?  I guess Hudson needs to look at his pay check next time.  Hudson needs to look in the stand&rsquo;s next game and see who pays for his contract, i believe its every race</p>
