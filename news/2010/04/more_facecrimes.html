			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Spencer, Alternative Right, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Peter Brimelow has discussed the expansion of speech codes to cover not just &#8220;hate speech&#8221; but &#8220;hate facts&#8221;  &mdash;  that is, data that is objectively true, sometimes even deriving from government sources, but which might darken the public&rsquo;s outlook towards multiculturalism and thus must never be mentioned. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate facts&#8221; can be visual, too, as in you&rsquo;re not allowed to believe your lying eyes.</p>
<p>In Sweden, the press is regularly suppressing and altering pixelated crime photos in which the race of the alleged perpetrator is still discernible. Blurry images of brown and black faces are being digitally bleached in order to make criminals seem less African and Arab.   </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Why stop at making pixilated images of black and brown people seem white? Most people can guess a criminal&rsquo;s race by hearing the neighborhood in which the crime occurred. Why doesn&rsquo;t the Swedish press simply take the next logical step and start falsely reporting on a white-on-Arab crime wave sweeping Scandinavia.</p>

		<p>I simply do not understand the whole &#8220;we are one people&#8221; thing.  White countries go out of their way to prove that, lets say. Swedes and Arabs are interchangeable.  Time and time again they are proven wrong.  Yet like an alchemist trying to turn base metal into gold they continue.  Just as in the middle ages it now seems that, in order to fool the King, they are covering lead with gold leaf.  Yet underneath the gold leaf all they have is lead.  At what point does the King say enough is enough?  At what point do his subjects say enough is enough?  I can only suppose that white people have so much lead damage to their nervous systems that most are unable to see beneath the gold leaf and make the rational conclusion that Swedes and Arabs are not interchangeable<br>

		<p>Are the Swedes really this dumb? Not that I believe political correctness hasn&rsquo;t gone this far, but what would be the point of showing a picture of a perpetrator of any race, and then blotting out his face to hide his identity, much less his race? If the rationale is to protect the identity of juveniles who haven&rsquo;t yet been found guilty in a court of law, fine, but then why show a picture of them in the first place? Maybe it&rsquo;s because I was just reading an article about urban legends, but this definitely sounds like it falls into that category.</p>

<p>Multiculturalism/multiracialism could not exist in any country without propaganda and lies.</p>
<p>And both have to be maintained at a certain intensity or the entire system will fold.</p>

Yes, Swedes for the most part are really that dumb. Just look at the Swedes in America. Most are liberal and naive to say the least&hellip;Not to mention many are &#8220;Judeo&#8221; Christians!</p>

<p>Tim, The Swedes are losing it.  That&rsquo;s why they do this.  Their society is going down fast, just all the other White societies, including ours.  If people think that&rsquo;s insane, they&rsquo;re right.  But it&rsquo;s going to get worse, much, much worse.  Whom the gods destroy, they first make mad.</p>

		<p>All you posters wondering about Swedes mentality are missing that many of our local papers have been leaving off the names of perps in police reports for some time to hide the fact of high Hispanic crime rates in regions (like Northern California) where the real estate &#8220;industry&#8221; was afraid to loose sales.  But this is done in many areas, and sometimes just because it became considered politically incorrect to finger the perps as a racial/ethnic group.  So here it is also done to preserve the profits of Christain businesspeople who I have always noted in real estate, tend to be not just Christians, but Republicans.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy goes on.</p>

		<p>We are doing it HERE but just in a different way.  Watch any news on any channel when they report a crime and ask for help in finding/identifying the criminal.  They either give you NO information as to description and tell you to call a crime number, or they give you meaningless information - such as the perpetrator is between 5&rsquo;8&#8221; and 6&rsquo; tall wearing a black hoodie and baggy jeans.  When they finally catch they guy, he is 99% of the time a black male.  Though recently we had several black females holding up local banks.  And all we got for a description was &#8220;female&#8221;.  They did show a security camera shot of the two women, and you could barely make out they were black.  But you could tell.  Barely.  The news just refuses to indicate race, because if they did, we would have NO other choice than to realize that blacks and hispanics commit 75% of the crimes among us.  They don&rsquo;t want us to have that realization.  So they hide it.  But when a WHITE commits a crime, you get the full description, and photos if they have them, and they make SURE you understand it was a white doing the crime.</p>

<p>Although white societies as a whole are going down, as you mentioned, keep in mind that not all of them do so at the same rate. I´d say Sweden is in a particularly bad shape, along with Great Britain (the latter is at least fortunate enough to have the BNP). However, Eastern and Southern European countries (Italy, Poland, etc.) do not embarrass themselves with ueber-political correctness and the indoctrination of their people into self-hatred.</p>

		<p>I am Swedish American. We understand racial reality here in America because we have lived through it for generations. I was horrified to learn about how Sweden let in so many third world immigrants. Sweden now has the highest rape rate in Europe. The Swedes are so horrifyingly stupid, they still embrace &#8220;diversity&#8221;. They let third world rapists and murderers steal their country. They continue to be stupid. A gallup poll shows that only 11% of Swedes believe that immigration is a problem, one of the lowest rates in Europe. Surprisingly, the highest rate of anti-immigrant sentiment comes from South African blacks. Even they have more common sense than Swedes.</p>

<p>In another recent story just a few days ago, a young Toronto woman was &#8220;<i>sexually assaulted</i>&#8221; (gang-raped) by &#8220;<i>three men wearing hoodies</i>&#8221; (3 Black males) near York University. </p>
<p>How do I know the race of the rapists? Because I was listening to a 5:30 AM radio news broadcast when an investigating police officer uttered that description to a radio reporter. </p>
<p>But during the rest of the day&rsquo;s hourly news broadcasts, the gang-rapists&rsquo; descriptions were downgraded to just &#8220;<i>three men wearing hoodies</i>&#8221;.</p>

		<p>And now the smug Europeans, who have crowed for years about our high rates of violent crime, are facing the riches of diversity and seeing, firsthand, what happens when a society is no longer majority white. Perhaps we Americans aren&rsquo;t such evil &#8220;racists&#8221; after all. Perhaps we&rsquo;re just experienced.</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t comment on Sweden, but I know it doesn&rsquo;t work here.  Check out the (otherwise liberal) SF Gate website, specifically whenever there&rsquo;s a violent crime in Oakland.  The first comments are always &#8220;what were the races involved&hellip;?&#8221; followed by anger that the various print &amp; cyber news sources are all clearly trying to hide the facts.  </p>
<p>People, even liberals, are wise to it, &amp; they&rsquo;re angry about it. </p>

<p>She said that before the break-up of the USSR if someone wanted a more desirable house or apartment they went to the KGB and claimed the occupants had bad mouthed communism or the KGB or the leader.  </p>
<p>As a reward for being an informant they got the innocent person&rsquo;s home and the innocent person was sent to a gulag for life.  </p>
<p>Under communism everyone is considered guilty until proven innocent and no attempt is made to prove a person innocent.</p>

 &#8220;I am Swedish American.  I was horrified to learn about how Sweden let in so many third world immigrants. Sweden now has the highest rape rate in Europe,  [yet]  they still embrace &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;.  A gallup poll shows that only 11% of Swedes believe that immigration is a problem.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
 <br>
These are interesting points.  Of course, the problem is complex,  with many roots, but it&rsquo;s interesting to consider that both Sweden and Britain are  insular cultures on the periphery of Europe.  They are not &#8220;stupid&#8221;   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re just inexperienced with these things.<br>
 <br>
Think of it as something similar to vaccination.  A person who has never been exposed to a disease has not developed any resistance to it, no antibodies.   To my best knowledge, Sweden  has NEVER been invaded   &mdash;   by  ANYBODY  (if we disregard Denmark which is essentially the same). Thus, they have no historical experience with invasions or threats from foreign cultures.   Ever!  What is going on now is a totally unprecedented experience for them.   They are like birds on some remote Pacific island who have never known any danger and are  without fear of predators.   <br>
 <br>
Britain  too is similar, being (at least for the past thousand years) free of foreign invasion, thus unworried about foreigners and feeling unthreatened by them,   Also, Britain, having been a  great empire and sea power,  is used to being in control and thus  with no reason to fear foreigners from backward countries whom they regard at most as &#8220;quaint&#8221;  rather than dangerous.<br>
 <br>
But places like Serbia, Sicily, Spain, have been border societies for centuries, fully exposed to the  ever-present external menace.  They are suspicious about outsiders.  Places on the eastern and southern boundaries of Europe, unlike the   (hitherto secure) British Isles and Scandinavia, have no illusions about the innocuousness of foreigners or the delights of multi-culturalism.  They don&rsquo;t want it!   Unlike those trusting Swedes, who lack any experience with predators, they&rsquo;re leery about foreigners.<br>
