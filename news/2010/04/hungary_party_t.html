			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Traynor, Guardian (London), April 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It has been a good few weeks for racists, populists and rightwing radicals across Europe. A comeback for Jean-Marie Le Pen&rsquo;s National Front in French regional elections. Big gains in Italy for the anti-immigrant Northern League. The Islam-baiting campaign of Geert Wilders in the Netherlands has taken his Freedom party to 25% and poll position ahead of June&rsquo;s general election.</p>
<p>And this weekend, Hungary is facing its biggest political earthquake in 20 years of democracy. On Sunday, the mainstream right and the neofascists are expected to take over the Westminster lookalike parliament on the banks of the Danube. It will be a landslide victory.</p>
<p>The left and the liberals who have run the country for eight years, taking Hungary to the brink of bankruptcy and into the arms of the International Monetary Fund, will be reduced to a rump.</p>
<p>The next prime minister, Viktor Orban, a combative populist, is leading his centre-right Fidesz party to a huge majority, running at more than 60% in the opinion polls. He may even secure a two-thirds majority enabling him to rewrite Hungary&rsquo;s constitution at will.</p>
<p>But the biggest breakthrough will be for Jobbik, the extremist antisemitic and antigypsy movement &#8220;for a better Hungary&#8221;, which will win seats in the parliament for the first time and may emerge as the second biggest party.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a flood that&rsquo;s coming. Everyone knows it&rsquo;s coming. We&rsquo;re just waiting for it. Will we drown or will we swim,&#8221; said Pal Tamas, director of Budapest&rsquo;s Institute of Sociology. &#8220;People are trying to use the antifascist argument against Jobbik. But it&rsquo;s not working. It&rsquo;s being very poorly received.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the past week a rabbi&rsquo;s home in the capital has been attacked during Passover and a Holocaust memorial was defaced. Budapest Jews have taken to the streets to protest. The country&rsquo;s large and marginalised Roma and gypsy communities are bracing themselves for a surge in racism and harassment.</p>
<p><b>Roma solution</b></p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of the gypsy issue, the situation in certain parts of the country is akin to civil war,&#8221; said Jobbik&rsquo;s young leader, Gabor Vona. &#8220;Now only drastic interventions are capable of helping .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we must produce an environment in which gypsy people can return to a world of work, laws and education. And for those unwilling to do so, two alternatives remain: they can either choose to take advantage of the right of free movement granted by the European Union, and leave the country, because we will simply no longer put up with lifestyles dedicated to freeloading or criminality; or, there is always prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though banned, Jobbik maintains a &#8220;Hungarian guard&#8221; of paramilitaries who dress in 1940s fascist paraphernalia. Vona wants this &#8220;gendarmerie&#8221; to police Roma &#8220;ghettos&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jobbik is openly legitimising anti-Roma violence. It is openly antisemitic. And it will do very well on Sunday,&#8221; said Anton Pelinka, an Austrian political scientist working in Budapest.</p>
<p>Gaspar Miklos Tamas, a liberal and veteran anticommunist dissident, wrote this week that &#8220;a national tragedy&#8221; was befalling Hungary. &#8220;There are many factors, but the most important is the success of the post-fascist Jobbik party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jobbik won 15% of the vote in last summer&rsquo;s elections to the European parliament and could repeat the trick on Sunday, threatening to push Hungary&rsquo;s governing socialists into third place.</p>
<p>The breakthrough comes as the far right across Europe becomes more than a fringe presence. In France a fortnight ago, the xenophobic National Front won 11% of the vote in regional elections, with 20% of those who voted for Nicolas Sarkozy three years ago opting for the far right.</p>
<p>Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s rightwing coalition coasted to victory in Italian regional elections last week, but the real winner was Umberto Bossi&rsquo;s Northern League which captured the regions of Piedmont and Veneto and made big inroads in the working-class areas of northern Italy, normally a stronghold of the left.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Dutch elections, Wilders appears to be going from strength to strength, while later this month in Austria, the far-right mother of 10, Barbara Rosenkranz, whose husband publishes a neo-Nazi newsletter, will contest the Austrian presidency with the support of the country&rsquo;s bestselling tabloid, the Kronen Zeitung.</p>
<p>In Belgium the extreme right separatist Vlaams Belang party has been joined by mainstream rightwing parties, so secessionists now enjoy almost 50% support among Flemish voters, according to the polls.</p>
<p>A conventional explanation for the breakthrough of the far right sees the success as a protest vote, waxing and waning depending on the performance of the mainstream parties of the centre-right and left.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not such a big victory for Jobbik and Fidesz, more a result of the failures of the previous government and its incredible incompetence,&#8221; said Julius Horvat, head of European studies at Budapest&rsquo;s Central European University.</p>
<p>But analysts detect a more durable pattern, particularly in western Europe, entrenching the far right as an established presence in politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no longer a sudden surge that then vanishes. The far right has become a permanent fixture in our societies now,&#8221; said Jean-Yves Camus, a specialist in European radical movements at the Paris thinktank the Institute of International and Strategic Relations.</p>
<p>In France, Le Pen has been a major factor in politics for 25 years. In Austria, the far right has been a key player since the late Joerg Haider hijacked the political agenda in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Today in Rome, the &#8220;post-fascist&#8221; National Alliance of Gianfranco Fini held a centre-right conference on whether Italy should be transformed into a presidential system modelled on France. This week Bossi held a &#8220;summit&#8221; with Berlusconi to push his agenda of federalising Italy, meaning his wealthy northern power base stops subsidising the south.</p>
<p>The Northern League has been in government in Italy for seven of the past nine years. In Denmark the far right has long been propping up a conservative government in parliament, and in Switzerland it is the strongest party. The far right leaders are now central and not peripheral players in their national politics.</p>
<p><b>Disaffected conservatives</b></p>
<p>Political scientists note that while there is much talk of &#8220;neofascism&#8221;, in western Europe some of the most successful parties are rooted less in 1930s European fascism than in disaffection with mainstream conservativism. Whether out of opportunism or conviction, many have shifted to the far right to exploit the potent issues of immigration and Islam and to broaden their electoral base. This has occurred in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s new is that some of the conservatives have moved to the radical right, rejecting multiculturalism, Islam and immigration,&#8221; said Camus. &#8220;It&rsquo;s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a radical right that is disconnected from the traditions of European fascism.&#8221;</p>
<p>In colonising the far-right territory, these former conservatives are winning over traditional leftwing voters. Where previously their powerbase was made up from small businesses, shopkeepers, and lower middle class, they are now making inroads into the working-class vote among those hostile to immigration and worried about job losses.</p>
<p>In Hungary and in the young democracies of central Europe, the situation is different.</p>
<p>&#8220;In post-communist Europe, it&rsquo;s the old-fashioned far right. In Western Europe, it&rsquo;s the postmodern far right,&#8221; said Pelinka. &#8220;In central Europe it&rsquo;s still the old enemies  &mdash;  the Jews, the gypsies, the national minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>If wealthy societies of western Europe are seized by new phobias, in the east old prejudices die hard. While 55% of Hungarians do not want Romas as neighbours, half are opposed to a homosexual or lesbian next door and 22% are averse to having a Slovak, Romanian or a Jew for a neighbour,according to a poll by Pal Tamas, leading Hugarian sociologists.<br>

<p>Maybe they see the truth, comrade, and no longer want to fear rape, abuse, and murder at the hands of muslims. You can tie immigration and Islam together since in modern-day Europe, that&rsquo;s pretty much all you get!<br>

<p>Would that this would happen in the U.S. but it did make me wanna move to Hungary. ANON is correct saying this too &#8220;You can tie immigration and Islam together since in modern-day Europe, that&rsquo;s pretty much all you get!&#8221; nothing but African black muslims, Jamaican blacks or Haitian blacks&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Yes the opinion polls are good in Britain too. The BNP and UKIP are establishing a significant electoral presence. In England, ignoring left wing Scotland, we could see as much as a 65% vote share for the centre and hard right. Of course Northern Ireland is always solid right and Wales is catching up with England with a move away from the previously dominant left.</p>

<p><i>The country&rsquo;s large and marginalised Roma and gypsy communities are bracing themselves for a surge in racism and harassment.</i></p>
<p><br>
Translation: Gypsy communities are bracing themselves for no longer being able to inflict <i>their</i> racism and harassment on white Europeans. Good lord, some of them might even have to (shudder) get <i>a job!</i> </p>
<p>And if not, as Gabor Vona says, &#8220;there is always prison.&#8221; </p>
<p>I must say, though, I&rsquo;m a little worried about Jobbik&rsquo;s &#8220;antisemitism.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t know how important this plank is in the party&rsquo;s platform, but Jew-baiting is, to me, always a mistake   &mdash;   not only because it&rsquo;s going after the wrong target (Jews are not the problem); but also because it&rsquo;s the surest way to get yourself branded &#8220;Nazi&#8221; by the media. When, for instance, the BNP   &mdash;   who have formally renounced antisemitism under Nick Griffin   &mdash;   get called &#8220;Nazi,&#8221; they can truthfully respond with, &#8220;No we&rsquo;re not, we have Jewish members and we even have an elected Town Councillor who&rsquo;s Jewish.&#8221; But when Jobbik get called &#8220;Nazi,&#8221; and they are in fact harassing Jews, the charge might actually stick. </p>
<p>Also, are uniforms   &mdash;   especially ones reminiscent of the 1940s   &mdash;   really necessary for a legit political party? The other so-called &#8220;Far Right&#8221; parties in Europe (the BNP, France&rsquo;s FN, Switzerland&rsquo;s PVV, etc) all seem to get by just fine without any official dress code. My advice to Vona and Jobbik would be to lose the Halloween costumes and stick to suits and ties. </p>
<p>That way the enemy won&rsquo;t see you coming. </p>

<p>I read some of the actual official proposals of these &#8220;far-right&#8221; parties, and they read to me like official American Republican Party platforms before 2000.  Now, I know that they were nothing more than words on paper; Bob Dole, who actually won a Republican nomination at the same time a conservative platform was adopted at his own nominating convention, said as such.<br>

		<p>As a Hungarian, I can assure Amren readers that the &#8216;national tragedy&rsquo; has been the eight years of Socialist/Liberal rule.<br>
Jobbik speaks for the little guy, and in the current political environment, they will do well tomorrow.<br>
The left wing media as we all already know calls any and all nationalist (patriotic) parties &#8216;fascist&rsquo; and &#8216;neonazi&rsquo;. The word gets thrown around much like &#8216;racist&rsquo; does in the US.</p>

<p>  One of the few honest statements in this otherwise biased report. Other conventional &#8220;conservative&#8221; parties won&rsquo;t address either immigration reform or minority crime and favoritism. Jobbik addresses both. It is not a &#8220;fascism&#8221; party in that Jobbik doesn&rsquo;t advocate either dictatorship or one party rule. Jobbik also upholds the rule of law, not arbitrary government tyranny.  Any party that opposes leftwing multiculturalism is termed &#8220;fascist&#8221; by the vulture media.</p>

		<p>Well, despite the fact that Europe has its ridiculous &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; laws, they&rsquo;re still far ahead of us in terms of loyalty and consciousness. They&rsquo;re finally beginning to recognize that they have legitimate interests to defend their people and their nations. In no way does that make them &#8220;extremists.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Japan, South Korea, and China were to experience massive black and Muslim immigration, would they stand for it? Of course not. If any non-white nation were to experience a massive influx of outsiders, they would take quick steps to show them the door, and there would be nothing extremist about it. </p>
<p>Every other group is allowed to have their homogenous nations and preserve a solid identity. Only white nations are expected to open up their borders and embrace their dispossession at the hands of aliens. Yeah, I know, the multiculturalists and anti-racists will insist that diversity is a wonderful and beautiful thing, and that even if it is a negative presence, we deserve it due to colonialism and imperialism. Still, why so many whites continue to tolerate this madness is beyond me. </p>

		<p>I am ALL for countries moving to the right politically, to amend the multitudinous mistakes of the Left all over the world.  However, I do find it unfortunate that SOME of the right wing reformers find it necessary to go so far as to murder and deface property belonging to those they deem as &#8220;inferior.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t believe judging a race or group as &#8220;inferior&#8221; is appropriate for ANYONE to be doing, much less physically attacking members of such groups.  In this country, I believe that ghetto-mentality blacks and all Muslims are a clear and present danger to our society; but I do not believe it is right to go out and simply murder them or destroy their property.  There are legal means to restrain or get rid of those who are destructive forces in our society.  I would much rather stick to those than become a member of the lower classes myself.</p>

		<p>#7, I agree with your view on anti-Semitism, however I think the charges fail to stick on Jobbik.</p>
<p>The &#8220;1940&rsquo;s paramilitary garb&#8221; is based on traditional Hungarian dress, not the SS. As for Jews, read this:</p>
<p>http://www.jobbik.com/hungary-news/3015.html</p>
<p>Also note that Mrs. Morvai is married to a Hungarian Jew. I don&rsquo;t think Jews have much to worry about. Jobbik does seem  to carry a grudge against Israeli businesses that have made deals with the Hungarian government, but who knows, maybe there is some foreign corporate corruption hurting Hungary. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not conceding anything to the anti-racists. I&rsquo;m simply pointing out the arguments they use. I was also mainly referring to Western Europe, not Hungary. Still, such logic is used by leftists to justify &#8220;diversity.&#8221; </p>

<p>Hi #14 John McNeill, it&rsquo;s #7 Anon here. </p>
<p>Tanx for tip, pal! I visited Jobbik&rsquo;s website and had a read. You&rsquo;re right: they sound like the BNP, and even have Jewish volunteers and supporters like the BNP. The &#8220;antisemitism&#8221; charges are probably just MSM smears and hyperbole   &mdash;   just like the nonsensical &#8220;neofascist&#8221; scaremongering that all of Europe&rsquo;s so-called &#8220;Far Right&#8221; parties suffer in the press.</p>
<p>Jobbik does, however, have something against the gypsies   &mdash;   as well they should. Hungary has a serious problem with these perennial professional parasites, and Jobbik appears to be the only party who are serious ABOUT the problem. I fully support Gabor Vona on the &#8220;Roma&#8221; issue: the Magyar people (white Hungarians) infinitely financing foreign layabouts, pickpockets and crystal-ball readers, is unacceptable   &mdash;   so get a job or go to jail. </p>
<p>Nice, professional looking site too, with all articles translated into smooth, readable English. Here, have a look for yourself: </p>

<p>&#8220;The BNP and UKIP are establishing a significant electoral presence. In England, ignoring left wing Scotland, we could see as much as a 65% vote share for the centre and hard right.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to see the effects that the BNP and UKIP are having throughout Britain.  I do have to confess that it grieves me that Scotland is, at least in its political strata, so left-wing.  Granted I&rsquo;m not that well informed in British politics, so further enlightenment is welcomed.  Is the left-leaning in Scotland primarily among the politicians or are the people at large becoming lefties, too?  I&rsquo;m glad to see Northern Ireland and Wales holding their own.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Scot&rsquo;s left wing bias has anything to do with the genocide of race replacement.  But if I am wrong I would be dearly interested in reading how a Scottish &#8220;Liberal&#8221; could justify it.</p>

<p>I guess they couldn&rsquo;t find a native Hungarian to defame his own people, so they brought in an Austrian.  Maybe there&rsquo;s an Austrian paper somewhere quoting a Hungarian expat willing to defame Austria.</p>
