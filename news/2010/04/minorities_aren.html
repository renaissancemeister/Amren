<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36529727">Minorities Aren&rsquo;t Following Steele into the GOP </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Perry Bacon Jr. and Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, April 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele, under fire recently from members of his party for what they view as his shortcomings in management and communication, has also made little headway in another area: winning over minority voters to the GOP cause. </p>
<p>When Steele took the helm of the RNC last year, he said expanding the party beyond its traditional base was one of his main goals. But he has not been able to chip away at a current political reality: The vast majority of non-white voters are Democrats who generally approve of President Obama. </p>
<p>In a recent Washington Post  poll, 23 percent of non-white registered voters said they had favorable views of the Republican Party, compared with 72 percent who viewed the GOP unfavorably. Those numbers were similar to polls taken in 2008, before Steele took over as RNC chairman, when 28 percent of non-white voters had favorable views of the party and 67 percent unfavorable. </p>
<p><strong>Views mostly unchanged</strong></p>
<p>African Americans&rsquo; views of the GOP have barely budged since Steele&rsquo;s tenure began: In Post-ABC News polls following Steele&rsquo;s becoming the GOP&rsquo;s first-ever party chairman, 78 percent of blacks say they view the GOP unfavorably, again virtually unchanged from two years earlier. </p>
<p>Beyond a handful of speeches by Steele before minority audiences, there is little evidence the GOP has launched an &#8220;off the hook&#8221; public relations offensive that would take the party to &#8220;urban-suburban hip-hop settings,&#8221; as Steele promised in an interview with the Washington Times shortly after taking the RNC reins. Steele has made some high-profile moves to woo minority voters, most notably a speech in July to the NAACP. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When he was selected, there was a hope he would present a different image that would attract more African Americans to the Republican Party so that the party would seem more welcoming to people other than old white guys,&#8221; said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst who writes the Rothenberg Political Report . &#8220;He&rsquo;s been in the middle of so much controversy that he hasn&rsquo;t been able to do that.&#8221; </p>
<p>As the conservative Web site Daily Caller noted in a recent article, more than two dozen black candidates are running in House races across the country, some with enthusiastic backing from Republicans in Washington. </p>
<p>But only a handful, such as Ryan Frazier in Colorado and Allen West in Florida, are expected to emerge as victors in primaries against other Republicans in districts where they could then also win the general election. Many of them either won&rsquo;t win primaries or are running in districts with strong Democratic incumbents. It remains likely that, after this year&rsquo;s elections, the number of black Republican members of Congress will remain the same as it has been since Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.) retired from the House in 2003: zero. </p>

<p>Gee, that&rsquo;s terrible.  And I was <i>so</i> hoping that the Republican party would join hands with the Democrats in swooning over &#8220;African Americans&#8221; while they mock White men as &#8220;old White guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice, by the way, that the above quote comes from one &#8220;Stuart Rothenberg,&#8221; who is described as a &#8220;nonpartisan political analyst.&#8221;  In today&rsquo;s Wonderland World, being flagrantly anti-White is &#8220;nonpartisan,&#8221; while merely questioning the orthodoxy of Diversity makes one a &#8220;hateful right-wing extremist White supremacist Nazi.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Could anybody be so delusional as to think that men such as Michael Steele, Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, or Alan Keynes are going to attract typical blacks to the Republicans?  These men are regarded as race traitors, sellouts, and far worse by mainstream blacks, who have been indoctrinated by liberal whites to believe that their fate is completely out of their hands and dictated by the evil white man.  Their only relief from their condition lies in plundering the wealth created by others, who include the white man.  This is their central core belief, and nobody&rsquo;s going to change it by telling that their fate is theirs to control.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that this was indeed what the reps were after when they appointed Steele. Just more confirmation that calling the republican party, the &#8220;stupid party&#8221; is an apt description. All that giving the reps a hip hop makeover would accomplish is to provide a good laugh for blacks and other minorities, who would never abandon their golden goose, the dems. That and alienate their White base. What White conservative wants to be associate with hip hop? When I hear the term, I think of a black thug &#8220;rapping&#8221; about killing cops and Whitey.  </p>

<p>Am I missing something, or is the polling data actually reflecting a negative trend with Neo Comrade Steele&rsquo;s ability to attract nonwhite voters to the Republican party?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see: a 23% favorable rating now versus a 28% rating prior to his chairmanship, is a 5 point negative difference; while surprisingly, the 67% unfavorable rating has gone up to 72% recently, or another 5 point differential.  </p>
<p>How flabbergasting!</p>
<p>Comrade Chairman Steele is a joke; he has no appealing &ldquo;bling&rdquo; or &ldquo;sting&rdquo; for nonwhites, and most whites know he was picked only because of pigmentation and not his political prowess. Moreover, why would any racial group take the fool serious, when he cannot even present himself as mildly competent?  </p>
<p>Kinky S&M; fundraisers, please God!</p>
<p>The Republicans had better face a hard fact, they have only one power base, whites. Thus, maintaining and preserving a white majority of 65% or greater, is their only hope for their survival as a party of attainable power and consequence. Furthermore, they need to ruthlessly suppress and outlaw all: Marxist, terrorist, and racially incompatible &ldquo;organizations&rdquo; in this country, when they do hold power. </p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t, to hell with them; but may God help the rest of us!!!</p>

		<p>Republicans would do much better if they concentrated on winning the white vote.  Here&rsquo;s a list of actions that would achieve that goal:</p>
<p>1.  Enforce immigration law.</p>
<p>2.  Reduce legal immigration.</p>
<p>3.  Don&rsquo;t get us into stupid wars in the Middle East or anywhere else.  Hint:  None of the 911 terrorists were Iraqis.  None of them were Iranians.  Every April 15 I am reminded of how much more damage the U.S. government does to me than Ahmadinejad could ever do.</p>
<p>4.  Balance the budget.  The Republicans had 6 years under Bush when they controlled the presidency and both houses of congress.  Never once did they pass a balanced budget.</p>
<p>4.  Get rid of affirmative action and other anti-white racist laws.</p>
<p>5.  End the Department of Education.  Put a stake through it.  Dubya doubled its size.</p>
<p>6.  Uphold the Constitution.  Get rid of the Patriot Act and other evil attacks on the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Except for (2) all of this is part of Ron Paul&rsquo;s agenda   &mdash;   the Republican most hated by his own party.  That&rsquo;s why the Republican party is a hopeless wreck that deserves to die.</p>

		<p>Does the writer actually believe ANYBODY  was fooled by Steele&rsquo;s appointment?  There&rsquo;s a common phrase for what Steele is, but let&rsquo;s be a little more PC and just say it was clear from the get-go that Steele was appointed as a token black.  Kinda like the media was wetting their pants seeking diligently a black, ANY black, who they could champion as a Presidential candidate, the RNC was wetting THEIR pants diligently seeking ANY black to appoint as RNC chair.  And the pickin&rsquo;s is slim for blacks that are Republicans.  Always has been.  Putting a token black in as RNC chair had as much hope of persuading blacks to give up the party of entitlement as Lincoln had of persuading the South he was their friend.</p>

		<p>Like the other posters here, I have no tears to shed for the Stupid Party, which has betrayed virtually every principle it claims to stand for.  It&rsquo;s almost hard for me to believe that I was an officer in my college&rsquo;s Republican club.  </p>
<p>I have to point out, however, that articles like this one illustrate that virtually any institution in our society that&rsquo;s predominantly white is ipso facto suspected of covert racism   &mdash;   that includes NASCAR, the Tea Party movement, country music, etc., etc.  If an organization exists for a certain purpose, and minorities aren&rsquo;t interested in that, somehow that&rsquo;s the fault of the organization, and it&rsquo;s expected to alter its ways however may be necessary to attract minorities.  Yet no one would suggest, for instance, that the NAACP should abandon its support of affirmative action to attract white members. </p>
<p>Whites need to adopt a simple mantra   &mdash;   no more apologies, period.</p>

		<p>The GOP is the only game in town.  There is no viable 3rd party option and there isn&rsquo;t going to be one in the near future.  The Democratic (sic) Party is a racist, anti-white party that is doing everything in its power to cripple white middle-class America.  </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the Republican Party, then you change it by getting involved at your local and state level.<br>

		<p>Lets face it. Allot of White people are voting republican simply because they believe it&rsquo;s the worst of two evils. </p>
<p>I think the real way to create change is to have someone in the Tea party take up Affirmative Action as a priority issue. I think  this would put the republican party in a tight spot. Either Represent the interests of the majority of it&rsquo;s party (and America) or be completely transformed by the tea party. That transformation would also mean an ending of the Federal Reserve and that&rsquo;s the ABSOLUTE last thing the ultra wealthy want.</p>
<p>Force Steele to be the point man for ending Affirmative Action. We need to focus less on immigration and more on Affirmative Action. Affirmative Action appeals to peoples sense of fairness and is a winning issue.     </p>

		<p>What do you expect when it&rsquo;s understood that 96% of the African American vote went to Obama, a liberal leftist? Granted that the GOP has behaved like lefty lite, but Blacks show their preference to anything left of left. This is why they don&rsquo;t support Tea Party activity as well which stands for lesser government. </p>

		<p>The Republican Party is ignoring and mocking its most powerful base, hardworking, white conservatives.  Most blacks and hispanics won&rsquo;t be conservatives, nor will most whites want a party that gets a sizeable number of non-whites.  The Republicans are following a stupid business plan.  Steele is an insult to whites.</p>

		<p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but the GOP and the Tea Party are all just more of the same old same old. Both push the multi-culti agenda just like the libs. All are more interested in protecting and promoting vested interests than in finding real solutions. The real solution would be to do away with all immigration, affirmative action and racial preferences, etc. Steele&rsquo;s appointment was an act of desperation and clearly misguided. Its effect has been zero or even negative for the GOP.</p>
<p>It is impossible to form a true pro-white, pro-western civilization political party here. First, the enshrined 2 party system we have won&rsquo;t allow it. Second, such a party would be subject to sanctions and oppression from the moment it appeared, as has been the case with the so-called white supremacist organizations. White people are just not allowed to defend themselves or to even choose congregate with each other without being declared &#8220;racist,&#8221; or worse.</p>
<p>Why? Because they fear us. The last time white people started a pure white, whites only movement they needed a world war to squash them. It was called The Great Crusade - the Liberation of Europe. What a tragic joke&hellip;. We took Europe from the whites and gave it to the non-whites. We are doing the same here in the USA. The GOP, the Tea Party, and certainly not the libs will or can change that. Only white people can change that by their individual action, which can be as simple as refusing to buy into the &#8220;white guilt&#8221; mantra - that somehow all whites owe non-whites for the abuses committed by their progenitors. What has slavery and colonialism got to do with me?, they must ask. If you truly look back into the past you will find that many whites were as oppressed and abused as were non-whites. Yet whites themselves acted to fix all that. Slavery is gone (at least in the western world), colonialism has been repudiated and amends made and laws allow everyone to sit at the same table, so to speak. White laws made everyone civilly equal, subject to the same laws. Non-whites have even been granted special &#8220;rights.&#8221; The check has been paid in full - with interest.</p>
<p>It would make me happy to be able to turn the clock back 200 years or so and start over, and think about all this &#8220;it&rsquo;s all good&#8221; and &#8220;we&rsquo;re all equal&#8221; nonsense we now accept as given. It ain&rsquo;t all good, that much is clear.</p>

		<p>Steele was Ehrlich&rsquo;s knuckleheaded sidekick here in Maryland&hellip;for obvious reasons. O&rsquo;Malley has one too, Anthony Brown&hellip;for the same obvious reasons. I can&rsquo;t believe the black community doesn&rsquo;t raise hell that both of these black men are nothing but stage props. </p>
<p>Installing Steele as the Director of the RNC? Are you serious? I guess there wasn&rsquo;t an interview panel - the candidates just submitted head shots and the winner matched the desired color palette. </p>
<p>And how many hardworking white Republicans did the RNC throw under the bus when, by choosing Steele, they essentially said &#8220;Now, even in your private political interests, we&rsquo;re going to flagrantly promote afro-centric interests at the expense of the white people who do all the work around here.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I have received GOP spam email nearly every day, all with Steele&rsquo;s name on it, proclaiming one &#8220;emergency&#8221; after another, all begging me for money.  Ben Stein went on national TV complaining that the GOP was calling him at home nearly every day, begging for money.</p>
<p>Where does this money go when the GOP actually gets it?  It funds Presidential campaigns for crypto-Democrat neo-cons like John McCain and pays for the white strippers Steele is so fond of (he recently spent $1900 of donors&rsquo; money at a strip club).</p>
<p>My wife has taken to calling Steel &#8220;Shoe-Shine Boy&#8221;, and I think the Republicans deserve to have their behinds kicked in every election until they wise up.</p>
