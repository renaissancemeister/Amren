<h1>Minority Contractors Halt City Project</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Flener, KXAN-TV (Austin), April 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African American and Hispanic contractors in Austin said the city is not including them in big projects in town.</p>
<p>Thursday, they pitched a major protest in front of the Austin City Council more than a $67 million Austin Energy project.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
But Mele [said Austin Energy Deputy General Manager Cheryl Mele] and other Austin Energy staff faced major resistance from the Austin City Council Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s appropriate to award this today,&#8221; said Austin Mayor Pro-Tem Mike Martinez.</p>
<p>Martinez and council member Sheryl Cole led a postponement of the contract because both the African American and Hispanic Contractors Associations in town felt they were left out of the $67 million contract.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Austin has a law on the books saying contractors have to meet certain goals to include minorities, women and small businesses in construction projects in town.</p>
<p>The groups said no participation goals were met by the contractor, DPR Construction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So the council will keep the existing center in Downtown Austin at least until Austin Energy staff comes back with more answers by May 27.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And that future Austin Energy building will sit in East Austin waiting to include more people to remodel it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think today was a win for the entire city,&#8221; said Fuentes.<br>

		<p>Voters in St. Louis passed a sales tax increase this month just to keep the local public transit system functional.  The reason for the budget shortfall was that the most recent leg of the light rail was 2 years late and $200 million over budget, thanks to incompetent affirmative action contractors.</p>

<p>Racist, sexist, and un-Constitutional. Besides, I thought government agencies used the bid system and took the lowest bids? What the heck does that have to do with race or gender?</p>

		<p>The thing is this. They&rsquo;ve had this type minority fovoritism in contracting for years now. But most White owned businesses get aound it by either setting up a front minority owned business of their own (many times the White owners wife), or working with an actual minority who has set up shop just for the purpose of being a front to get minority contracts, but now do any actual work or man the job with minorities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how corrupt setaside contracting just breeds more corruption.</p>

		<p>Bid system? HAH!</p>
<p>Why would the bid system matter when governments are EAGER to pay for any cost overruns?<br>
They give the money to companies with the most amounts of bribes and non-whites and women.</p>

		<p>Just out of curiosity, did the Hispanic and black contractors ever show up and bid for the contract?  Or are they waiting for gilt-edged engraved invitations?</p>

		<p>Translation:</p>
<p>The City of Austin did not allow enough time from initial public announcement of projects and close of bidding to allow minorities to somehow or another organize a business entity that would be eligible to provide the services in question. Being &#8220;eligible&#8221; of course would require (among other things) capital which in many cases would require behind the scenes white equity and it would require that the nominal or actual minority owners of record be bondable, which usually would mean that the minorities not have histories of fraud and contract non-compliance.</p>

		<p>why do they deserve to be angry, and get coverage? Obviously, by the looks of the &#8216;white pride article&rsquo; which appears later, for starters, they think it&rsquo;s just great excluding whites.</p>

		<p>My brother is a sheetmetal worker. It used to be that a large part of his companys&rsquo; buisness was tearng out the work of minority firms and redoing it. Of course we taxpayers are the ones who pay the premium on the freight.  </p>
