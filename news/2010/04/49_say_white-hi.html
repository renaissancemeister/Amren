<h1><a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/april_2010/49_say_white_hispanic_relations_getting_worse">49% Say White-Hispanic Relations Getting Worse</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen Reports, April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Forty-nine percent (49%) of U.S. voters now believe relations between whites and Hispanics in America are getting worse, up 15 points from 34% in December. But voter perceptions of black-Hispanic relations are unchanged.</p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that just 28% think white-Hispanic relations are improving.</p>
<p>In the previous survey, 40% said relations between white Americans and Hispanics were getting better.</p>
<p>The survey taken Monday and Tuesday nights follows Arizona&rsquo;s passage of a controversial law to crack down on illegal immigrants. Sixty-four percent (64%) of voters in the state support the new law. So do 60% of voters nationwide.</p>
<p>But 58% also favor a policy that would welcome all immigrants except &#8220;national security threats, criminals and those who would come here to live off our welfare system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twenty-eight percent (28%) of voters now say there is more discrimination these days against Hispanics than against African-Americans or women, up seven points from December. Twenty-one percent (21%) say women are more discriminated against, while just 13% say the same of blacks. Thirty-eight percent (38%) are not sure. In the previous survey, voters put women at the head of the list, with Hispanics second and blacks third.</p>
<p>There has been virtually no change over the past four months in voter perceptions of black-Hispanic relations. Nineteen percent (19%) say the relationship between blacks and Hispanics is getting better, while 37% believe it&rsquo;s getting worse.</p>
<p>Fifty-five percent (55%) believe relations between blacks and whites are getting better, down from 62% in December. Twenty-three percent (23%) say that relationship is getting worse, and 17% say neither is the case.</p>
<p>Seventy-seven percent (77%) of voters say relations between whites and blacks are better today than they were in the 1960s, marking very little change from the previous survey. Eighteen percent (18%) say relations between the two are not better today.</p>

<p>58%? What percentage of those polled are white? Assuming a &#8216;conservative&rsquo; disagrees with how diversity or multiculturalism is being run, what percentage would fear giving a pollster their true opinion because of fears of big brother or uncle Tom? And what exactly do them mean when they say a regions been &#8216;polled&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>Well, Anonymous, I&rsquo;d guess that the poll was taken in heavily hispanic States.  The tipoff is the related poll saying 77% say relations between blacks and whites is BETTER than in 1960.  Had to be blacks answering that question.  Back in 1960 whites weren&rsquo;t being raped, murdered, robbed and assaulted en masse by blacks.  Nor, by the way, were blacks being raped, murdered, robbed and assaulted by whites back in 1960.<br>
Nor are they now.  But WE whites are now routinely murdered, raped, and assaulted by blacks who have been &#8220;empowered&#8221; i.e. unleashed upon us and told they had the right to kill us for past grievances.  Actually, it&rsquo;s just American blacks behaving like blacks world wide now that the common sense restrictions upon them were lifted 50 years ago.</p>

		<p>I think what divides Hispanics and whites the most is the very touchy issue of illegal immigration.  The Hispanics want amnesty and the whites don&rsquo;t, plain and simple.  So that issue is the main bone of contention between our two groups.  Personally, I like the Hispanics for the most part, and I get along with them very well.  I can speak Spanish when I need to, although I am not completely fluent.  I love Mexican food, Spanish food, and I enjoy the Spanish flamenco.  I find Mexican music boring - for musicians, it&rsquo;s I-IV-V-I over and over again, with 2 trumpets, a tuba, guitars, and a bass guitar.  Yawn.  But for a shrimp burrito about now&hellip;.</p>

		<p>White-Hispanic relations are getting worse? How could they not be? Whites sense, correctly, that they are on the wrong side of history. They are the one group it is safe to attack and belittle. Hispanics sense just the reverse. They are a &#8220;protected&#8221; class or race or group. And so they become ever more boldly Hispanic and in your face, whitey. It would not be nearly as bad if Hispanics were like the Irish, the Poles or the Italians before them and passionately wanted to assimilate, to be Americans. But with rare exceptions they don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t want to have any part of &#8220;the gringo,&#8221; his ways or his language. Unless tough minded whites recapture our government the loss of the southwest is almost guaranteed. </p>

		<p>The fact is that Hispanics are going to be more of a problem than Blacks ever were. Already you see spanish only signs in cities. Spanish is the official language of Miami, Florida. California has all but become Mexifornia. It is really sad. </p>
<p>Just two weeks ago I was in the grocery store and I saw three Hispanic men arguing with a White male. Thy were loud, yelling and sounded like they were about to get violent. </p>
<p>Some of you have discussed the coming Hispanic problem years ago. You were correct. Now it is coming to full fruition. </p>

<p>The ticket sales people did NOT speak English!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also lived in a West Texas neighborhood where the &#8216;locals&rsquo; made me feel most unwelcome (and I bet ALL of them were illegals).</p>
<p>Good job, Arizona, and may Texas find similarly-sized cajones to do the same.</p>

		<p>Relations between all the races in this multicultural nightmare are getting worse.  They&rsquo;ve been seriously deteriorating now for <br>
the last 30 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too bad that these multicults don&rsquo;t understand that the greatest divisions are between blacks and Hispanics, despite the happy face the racial leaders try to put on their relationship.  Right now they want to appear as unified, under the same umbrella, in order to take advantage of the additional clout larger numbers give them.</p>
<p>But the rank and file are too busy persecuting,fighting, and murdering each other to pay much attention to what kind of pretenses they&rsquo;re expected to show.  Riots between both groups are commplace, especially in California.</p>
<p>There are growing divisions between blacks and all other races too, since they like to try to intimidate and bully anyone no matter what race they are.</p>
<p>Writing about a widening gap between whites and mestizos, because it might be growng, is expected and old hat, and really isn&rsquo;t a newsworthy item.</p>
<p>The real newsmaker regarding the subject of inter-racial compatibility is anything that would indicate there was peacefulness, integration and comraderie between ANY racial groups in this country&hellip;&hellip;or Europe for that matter.</p>
<p>Break up started to occur when the 08 economic drop hit us and was exacerbated when an anti-white president was elected.  It&rsquo;s accelerating somewhat now, but it&rsquo;s still not as bad as it&rsquo;s going to be as the economy slips back into another recession, this time much worse than the one we&rsquo;re still trying to recover from.</p>
<p>There are tough times just ahead, folks.  Much tougher than most people can imagine.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s why I think they&rsquo;re getting worse. Illegal immigrants care <i>nothing</i> for becoming an American citizen. Sure, they want the social services and jobs but when it comes to really being a part of this country - loving it enough to go to war to defend it - they&rsquo;re not there. And most Americans know it.</p>
<p>When I read about how immigrants from Mexico died and requested their bodies be sent back to Mexico for burial - it spoke volumes. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care to see my great country used by immigrants as if our largesse is owed to them. We are not obligated to take in everyone who wants to live here. Other countries are requesting that those who immigrate bring something unique to benefit their new homeland. It isn&rsquo;t a given that they&rsquo;ll be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>I am tired of the world expecting the U.S. to continue welcoming illegals without any thought to the safety of our our own citizens. If people really want to make a better life, why not start with their Mexican home? Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that they wouldn&rsquo;t dare to hold a protest rally in their own country but yet somehow feel justified &#8220;demanding&#8221; justice in a country not their own? It truly is hubris at its extreme.</p>
<p>Most Americans are noticing that this current wave of immigrants (most illegal), do not care about assimilating into our culture. They are insisting upon retention of their own culture and as a result, eroding American values. That is why Americans are getting more fed up with a government that refuses to protect and preserve our nation.</p>

		<p>The survey question regarding black/white relations is somewhat misleading.  When people my age (born in the 50s) think about black/white relations in the 60s, we think of the civil rights struggle, with peaceful black demonstrators being attacked by police dogs and sprayed with fire hoses.  Black/white relations in the 60s were TERRIBLE from that perspective, although much better in other ways.  (Blacks behaved decently on public transportation, they usually didn&rsquo;t have hopelessly delusional ideas about being entitled to a quota in every career field, etc.).  </p>
<p>A more interesting question would have been to ask if black/white relations have improved since the 1970s or 1980s.  Personally, I had a significant degree of hope for diversity and multiculturalism in the 70s and 80s that I most certainly do NOT have now, and I truly fear for the future.  In my parents day, if you had enough money, you could move away from minorities and crime, and that isn&rsquo;t possible anymore.</p>

		<p>Arthur I disagree unless you are referring to sheer numbers. Blacks are far worse to deal with on every level and the hatred they have for whites is intense. Hispanics are a problem DUE to sheer numbers but they are not anywhere as threatening, and they are capable of living among whites without a constant level of hatred.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration is a problem as well as gangs profiting from the drug trade but often times hispanics can and do blend in with white populations seamlessly. I have worked with both hispanics and blacks and I can say there is no comparison between the two, I have never felt the racial tension that is nearly always present around blacks. Most hispanics still have foreign roots yet they manage to blend in much better than blacks that have been in this country for 200 years.</p>

		<p>2) I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it.  I think any whites that answered the question weren&rsquo;t looking at it from the white point of view.  They weren&rsquo;t thinking about crime statistics and the &#8216;war in all but name&rsquo; being waged against whites by blacks and other minorities.</p>
<p>They probably saw 1960, thought of jim crow/slavery/MLK and went, &#8220;Yeah I guess things are better now.&#8221;<br>

		<p> I left a job in Prescott Az where the employer had 2 classes of workers: College educated White technicians, and uneducated illegal Mexican labor. My position put me working directly with the illegals and sometimes having to direct the work flow. This was some kind of affront to them which resulted in one guy asking me to talk with him outside - where he promptly took a swing at me, yelling about how they run the shop and I&rsquo;d better learn my place.<br>
 I&rsquo;m a Marine Corps Veteran and 45yo, and don&rsquo;t play this game. After shutting this idiot down and reporting the incident to the owner, I was treated as the antagonist.<br>
 My point is this: US Citizens have been treated very badly by illegals here in Arizona for a very long time, and this &#8220;blame the White Guy&#8221; attitude from Mexico, Other US States, and our own Federal Government has created this. Myself, and many others have had enough - do you really believe the new law came out of the clear blue sky? We voted for one proposition after another to stem the tide just to have then Gov. Napolitano veto them.<br>
 Arizona hasn&rsquo;t turned it&rsquo;s back on anyone, we&rsquo;re just fed up with those responsible turning their backs on us. If anyone wants to call us the bad guys now, well&hellip; we simply just don&rsquo;t care.<br>
[Fact: there are more Arizona Citizens who carry sidearms in day to day business than don&rsquo;t, because the violent crime here].</p>

<p>The one question that is never asked is &#8216;Who thinks whites are more discriminated against these days?&rsquo;.  After all it is we who are the victims of affirmative action, etc, etc, etc.  That is state sponsored, legal discrimination.  We are discriminated disproportionately when our government robs us of our money (via taxes) to give to non-productive Others.  And yet they don&rsquo;t even ask if we feel more discriminated against.  It&rsquo;s a rigged and dishonest poll from the jump.</p>

<p>To be honest, I have to agree with Arthur on ths one. The fact is that Blacks can be a major (pain in the a..), mainly the lower income and poor ones. Actually I have had some positive experiences with a number of professional ones. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite Black cries for preferential treatment, entitlement programs etc&hellip; there is no American city where Black english or ebonics is the official langauge. I have yet to see pamplets with standard english and Black english on them spoken. I do not see teachers being pressured to learn Black english or school districts may lose funds. When I call to order a plane ticket or other service over the phone I have not heard the recording say &#8220;press one for english, press two for Black english&#8221; etc&hellip; it goes on and on. </p>
<p>On another post on this board, they have a most wanted list from the FBI. Guess who dominates it? Not Blacks, not Whites. <br>
Our nation is becoming the United States of Mexico. </p>
<p>I see Hispanics as far more problematic.</p>

		<p>@ El Cerotito:</p>
<p>You wrote: «&hellip;and I enjoy the Spanish flamenco».</p>
<p>But you see, Cerotito (what does your moniker mean?), flamenco is Spanish, and it belongs to a culture which is not the same as what you call Latino culture.</p>
<p>Flamenco was inspired by gypsie music, and the gypsies themselves were originally a group of people who lives in far flung India. They were banned, and migrated all the way to Europe. That&rsquo;s why flamenco, especially when the guitarists are playing in minor scales, I&rsquo;d say, can sometimes have an oriental flavor.</p>
<p>Mexican culture is a mixture of the culture of the American-Indian tribes that lived there before White men came from Europe (such as the Aztecs), and the culture of the White Spanish conquerors, mainly. But there have been other influences as well, because long after the conquest, there has been an influx of European immigration to Mexico.</p>
<p>I met a Mexican citizen, and he told me that Mexican society, more or less has a caste system: the Whites, who are generally richer and more educated, and who are called Criollos; the indigenous population, the Indios, who are often very poor ; and the people of mixed White and Indian blood, called the Mestizos.</p>
<p>Most of the immigrants to the US, both legal and illegal, are Mestizos.</p>

		<p>I would agree with Arthur also.  I would also say that hispanics and blacks are rather similar.  Given their obvious differences, that statement may seem strange, but let me explain.</p>
<p>Blacks are many generations removed from their home countries, and few have returned to see first hand what sort of societies they create.  Piled on top of their inflated self-worth, we have massive propaganda for black supremacy, entitlements, reparations, etc.  So the black behavior we see is a product of black nature plus white liberal coddling.</p>
<p>Hispanic illegals are no better at civilization, but having fled from themselves, on some level they seem to know that their relationship with us is parasitic and they better lay low.  They are here to steal, and to steal only.  It may seem strange, but you will find more humility and less hostility from illegals than you will from their anchor babies.  It&rsquo;s precisely these anchor babies that destroy everything they touch.  In that regard, they&rsquo;re just a bad as blacks if not more so.  </p>
<p>Hispanic nature plus more white liberal coddling is a truly toxic mix.  And of course as an area becomes overrun with illegals, all humility and friendliness disappears.</p>

<p>What do they hope to gain?  If we give their tribesmen amnesty, where are they going to earn money to live on?  The economy is crashing.</p>

<p>Questions: Of that 77 percent, what proportion was in adulthood and witnessed firsthand white-black relations in the 1960s? And what proportion of that 77 percent knows all about white-black relations in the 1960s only through government schools, Hollywood, and popular culture in general? </p>

		<p>Several posts on this topic have commented on the arrogance and rudeness, even violence, of some of the illegal alien Mexicans/Latinos in both Arizona and California,etc. I have no problems believing it at all. Here in Southern California, many houses have had Mexican flags hanging from their porches? Dozens of small and several huge marches have taken place for amnesty and other demands by illegal aliens. Several years ago,in the city of Montebello,Southern California, high school students at Montebello High School lowered the American flag from its pole mounted a huge Mexican flag and replaced the smaller American flag below it. Thousands of people saw this Mexican flag, flying at a high school in California. In the city of Baldwin Park, Southern California, a vile racist monument, that has an inscription reading that things were better before whites came to California, was the object of a demonstration by an anti-illegal alien group. Things became violent, when illegal aliens showed up and started throwing things, just like they did in Arizona a few days ago.</p>
<p>One could go on and on, literally filling up pages of examples, showing what so many Mexicans really think about their relationship to this state of California U.S.A., yet I&rsquo;m sure some leftist kook would call the average American racist for doing it. The simple fact is, there is most definitely an invasion taking place from Mexico, and it was all organized for years, as is now becoming clear. Building Contractors brought these people in by the thousands, farms, immigration firms, bus companies, businesses of all kinds throughout the United States.  I doubt most Americans relish the idea of an open border with Mexico and Mexican politicians in Mexico city, actually having influence in our lives.</p>

		<p>Each day I wait at the bus stop in New York city early in the morning and I&rsquo;d say that over half of the people who enter the bus are illegal immigrants. They are on their way to low paying jobs in restaurants, hotels and other establishments which most likely would not be filled by anyone with a green card, much less a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you look at the population of young people in the public school system you see at least half of the students really should not be part of the &#8220;No Child left behind&#8221; students, but they should really have not been allowed to continue beyond Middle School since their social behavior and basic intelligence is really too low to be doing high school work towards the Regents exams which give a full diploma.</p>
<p>Many of these students are the &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; of illegal immigrants who are doing the low paid and unpleasant jobs, but do you think any high school students will want to do these jobs as they get acculturated into the ghetto, youth sub-culture of the big cities of the U.S? - no way! If these same illegals had remained back in their Latin American countries as part of the working poor there, their children would not have so many false expectations created for them, and they would eventually be part of the labor pool needed for the maids, restaurant workers and hotel employees.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve basically created a situation here in the United States, where given a lax welfare system for the U.S. citizens in the U.S., and setting up a totally unrealistic public school system which is supposed to somehow prepare every student for college, the only source of workers to fill the most difficult and undesirable low paying jobs are illegals, mostly from Latin America. This is why the educational tie in needs to be looked at in addition to the question of how we can stem the tide of illegals flooding this country. One way or another, the capitalistic system will simply require these poorly paid jobs be filled, and if the only available workers are illegals these will fill such positions.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Forty-nine percent (49%) of U.S. voters now believe relations between whites and Hispanics in America are getting worse, up 15 points from 34% in December. &#8220;</p>
<p>I agree completely with the other posters who expressed suspicion that the areas selected for this idiotic poll were likely heavily non-white areas.   </p>
<p>The hard, cold, undeniable facts are these:  Every non-white, be they black, Mestizo, or any other third world born individual who isn&rsquo;t white - two seconds after their feet are planted upon American soil, they - thanks to our hostile, rabidly anti-white, alien ruling elites - are eligible for affirmative action, for racial preferences and for every other government sanctioned, discriminatory advantage over every white man, woman or child who were born in America and who&rsquo;s 100 percent White Founding Fathers built this nation - and who fully and un-apologetically intended for it to be passed down to THEIR posterity.   Their EUROPEAN descended posterity.  </p>
<p>And, remember - these virulently anti-white policies were enacted and thrust upon America while it was overwhelmingly a nation where whites were the huge majority of the over all population. And, every new set of non-white feet that cross our borders adds to the deliberate and planned disenfranchisement of that same white majority.  </p>
<p>So, any white American who doesn&rsquo;t understand these simple facts is a white American who is dumber than a box of rocks.  Any white American who is unable to see where all this is heading is a white American who needs to get their name added to the waiting list for a brain transplant, because the one they currently have in their thick, hard-headed skulls has some very serious malfunctions and is failing them miserably.</p>
<p>In short, the increased presence of ANY immigrants of non-white ancestral origins is not - in any way - an advantage to the dwindling white majority. Oh, and if whites think all these anti-white discriminatory laws are bad now - just wait to see what will most certainly happen, if non-whites are allowed to seize full and unchecked numerical advantage over whites and find themselves as the new ruling majority.    Fact:   These laws will be dramatically expanded and the discrimination against whites will accelerate until our race has had the life choked out of it.  </p>
<p>Another fact:  Non-whites know how to play hard ball when it comes to ethnic identity politics and to them, life is a racial spoils system.   Whites had better get a clue and fast - and cleanse themselves of the 50 years of white-guilt brainwashing that our hostile media has planted inside their brains.   We are in the biggest fight for our survival in the entire recorded history of the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic peoples, and we must be willing to get as ruthless as necessary in order to win  this battle. </p>

<p>Politics aside blacks are much much scarier to me personally. They are rude, violent, ignorant, and many hate Whites.

I work with a lot of Hispanics because my company is based in L.A. and occasionally visit the Hispanic metropolis on business. I do NOT feel the same unease around them.

<p>Yeah, the ones who hoisted it are so dumb they don&rsquo;t know the oligarchy in the country they are so honoring discriminates against them far more than any White here  &mdash;  to the point of pushing them across the border to get rid of them.</p>
<p>Not only that, they have little to no understanding that the Whites they so revile CREATED and PAY FOR the cushy life-style they enjoy here-from free First World medical care to preferences over Whites in employment to free K-university educations for their children  &mdash;  to the cars they drive without licenses, the  cable TV, lap top computers and cell phones they steal (and can&rsquo;t live without) all would not be possible without the White race.</p>
<p>Not a bad deal, I&rsquo;d say, as they scream about &#8216;racist&rsquo; Whites and our government discriminates against us for objecting.  </p>
<p>And from Luke&rsquo;s well-written post:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In short, the increased presence of ANY immigrants of non-white ancestral origins is not - in any way - an advantage to the dwindling white majority&hellip; thanks to our hostile, rabidly anti-white, alien ruling elites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, exactly right.</p>
<p>I would only add that there will be violence against Whites once we are a minority, and lots of it, just as there was in Russia and is in South Africa.</p>
<p>As I quoted from Kevin MacDonald a few threads back; this bears repeating, and often:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger. From the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution to contemporary Africa, the lesson is the same: Loss of political power means murder and mayhem directed against Whites by minorities with deep historical grudges&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tell everyone you know and Spread The Word.  And while you&rsquo;re at it, tell your White children and grandchildren to be proud of who they are and about the great achievements and accomplishments of the White race  &mdash;  to counter the lies and vitriol against our children spewed by the White-hating msm, government and especially academia.</p>
<p>Start here, with the March of the Titans:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.white-history.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.white-history.com/</a></p>
<p>I have never seen a White given credit for anything in school texts of the last 30 years  &mdash;  White children are told that Whites are evil colonists and genocidists.</p>
<p>Every day I plan to expound on White achievements with my loved ones, some of whom are amazingly resistant.</p>
<p>I asked my son yesterday, after I spoke about White-generated space travel and space exploration, to imagine a world without White creations.  What would be left?  What if, instead of a &#8216;day without mexicans&rsquo; (O! The Horror!), we had a &#8216;day without Whites and their creations?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Non-Whites would be living under rocks eating bugs with a live span of 20 years or less.</p>
<p>They certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be traveling in space, talking on cell phones, driving anything with an internal combustion engine, listening to iPods, watching plasma TVs, drinking clean water or receiving anti-biotics.</p>

<p>Luke: &#8220;I would like to point out what should be the glaringly obvious fact that the two primary organized, and well-funded, anti-White organizations in America (and their tentacles also reach out across the globe and into every majority White European nation)are #1: The Anti-Defamation League of B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith, and #2: The $outhern Poverty Law Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luke: &#8220;These two anti-white, subversive organizations (ADL, SPLC) are not funded or heavily staffed with the Blacks or Mestizos that Mr. Ranger inaccurately assigns blame to, for being opposed to &lsquo;all things white&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luke: &#8220;Let&rsquo;s not forget the importance of prioritizing the opposition, fellow AR readers.

		<p>I have not been a direct victim of black on white violence because I have learned to avoid blacks, and especially black communties.  In the past, I had a black friend here and there, but whenever there was a problem of any kind, the blame whitey ethic was predominant.  If there was a question of money, the buck stopped with me.  On the other hand, I have been repeatedly victimized by Hispanics, my home robbed several times and in one very life changing incident, my professional office was broken into and ransacked, putting me out of business.  I have never financially recovered from that setback.  Some Hispanics are very pleasant people and they have a culture that can be quaint and folky.  But what comes with that is a culture of resentment for anyone, especially white, who has more than them.  Like Amerinds in the 19th century, they feel that if they can lay their hands on it, it is okay to take it.  That includes females as sex objects too.  It is the overwhelming numbers of Hispanics and there presence in rural and suburban areas that has made them so dangerous to Americans.  Blacks still tend to congregate in large cities and most of their impact is limited to those regions (but that is changing too).</p>

<p>  I agree that the huge numbers of Hispanics are changing the dynamics of race relations between Hispanics and whites. In some places in the Southwest Hispanics are so numerous that they have created self contained colonies in constant contact with Mexico or Central America. There is a growing wave of media sanctioned racial/ethnic politics in the Hispanic community that was less apparent when their numbers were fewer.  If trends continue, I can see a day when the country may fracture alone linguistic and ethnic lines. </p>

		<p>I side with those  who say Mexicans are the bigger danger. Hispanics already outnumber blacks in the USA and will outnumber them by about 2.5 to 1 by the year 2050. Unlike blacks, Mexicans tend to believe they&rsquo;re taking back a country that belonged to them in the first place. Once more white Americans realize what &#8220;La Raza&#8221; means and what it intends to do, perhaps their delusions about tolerance will evaporate.</p>

		<p>Although I agree that illegal immigrants are a problem, I also have to agree with others here that I feel far less fearful around Mexicans than I do blacks. I lived in Houston Texas for 30 yrs. and I have to admit that the vast majority of Mexicans I encountered were hard workers and were civil with me. Very seldom did I have any problems while being around them, even when I was the only &#8220;gringo&#8221; around. I CANNOT say the same about blacks.  Just imagine this nightmare folks - - can you imagine how much worse off we&rsquo;d be if we were neighbors of Africa and had 20-30 million illegal AFRICANS in this country!

<p>I fail to see where I was inconsistent in any of my remarks.  I stand by my earlier contention that the ADL and SPLC are the two primary anti-white &#8216;organizations&rsquo; - and these organizations are very well funded.</p>
<p>Obviously, each and every non-white minority does not have a personal race-hustling &#8216;coach&rsquo; assigned to them by the ADL or SPLC, who follows them around 24/7, 365 and gives them their cues on when and where to pull the race card on the White man.  However that sort of behavior by minorities is both encouraged and, I think - to a large degree, promoted by the ADL and SPLC and their sympathetic anti-white mouthpieces in our mainstream media.   These two organizations plant the seeds into the heads of every non-white that every failure they encounter in their lives is the fault of the White man.  This message is constantly repeated and reinforced by a mainstream media that is intensely hostile to the interests of White Americans. </p>
<p>This brings us to the reality of how literally every non-white minority is hardwired to see the world around them from a racial self-interest perspective. This is a characteristic that all racial groups should have, assuming they are healthy in a racial sense - and the ADL and SPLC merely fan the natural instincts of each ethnic group, EXCEPT for whites.  We alone are to be  excluded from being able to think, act, behave and organize in a manner that would help whites protect and promote what is in their best and most legitimate ethnic interests.  </p>
<p>So, prioritizing the threats to our survival does place the ADL and SPLC at the top of the threat list.   These organizations are attempting to prevent whites from doing the very things that non-whites are celebrated for doing, namely, expressing pride in their culture, and advocating for their specific ethnic interests - interests that, if satisfied, always come at the expense of white ethnic interests.    </p>
<p>If the ADL and SPLC were to be abolished tomorrow, would  all of our problems be solved?</p>
<p>Answer:  Not likely.   But, one thing is certain - that whites would no longer be demonized and criticized by these two organizations for simply fighting back against what is clearly a declaration of intent by aggressive minorities to take this nation away from the descendants of our European Founding Fathers and transform it into a replica of whatever failed third world dump of a nation that the majority of them came from.   </p>

		<p>Question to all.  What ethnicity dominates the &#8220;Anglo&#8221; population of Arizona?  Is it WASP (plus maybe closely-related ethnicities like Scotch-Irish and German)?  Do these WASPs have their traditional bias against expression of emotion?  Are they &#8220;ice queens&#8221; or have &#8220;stiff upper lips&#8221;?  It is my guess that much of the Anglo population in the SW is of the managerial class, had recent ancestors all of the managerial class and who moved to the SW after having attained managerial class, at a time when managerial meant mostly WASP.  </p>
<p>Could it be that &#8220;gringo&#8221; and &#8220;pinche gabacho&#8221; refer directly to WASPishness that stings deeply-emotional Hispanics particularly strongly?  For instance:  a Hispanic school student has a bad run-in with an old prissy WASP guidance counselor, who communicates to the student (maybe indirectly) that one needs an &#8220;ice queen&#8221; personality to succeed in any professional career.  Or, adult Hispanics simply interpret WASP personality as mean and nasty and saying &#8220;you have to be a cold person to truly belong in the United States&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Both sides need philosophers and deep-thinking sociologists, which aren&rsquo;t there.  El Cerotito (#3) has a point which he isn&rsquo;t making clear because (my guess) he doesn&rsquo;t have the conceptual tools with which to do so.  Someone needs to spell out what *is* good about Mexican and other Hispanic cultures, not leave it as a vague &#8220;I like&hellip;&#8221;.  (And those who &#8220;don&rsquo;t like&#8221; need to spell out more precisely what about these cultures eats at them and how and why.) </p>
<p>Point of curiosity on flamenco:  the chant is largely Jewish with Muslim and Greek influences (many Spanish churches used a Greek-type liturgy for a while).  I was at a flamenco concert recently and it sounded like Rosh Hashanah services (though that may have been deliberate emphasis to illustrate Jewish roots). </p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because &#8220;familiarity breeds contempt.&#8221; The more we get to know hispanics, the less we like them&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Which is of course the EXACT OPPOSITE of what the Multicult has been telling us for the past half century. The entire Civil Rights movement was based on the psychological premise that once whites stopped pre-judging blacks and browns, and actually got to know them, we&rsquo;d learn that they were &#8220;really just the same as us.&#8221; </p>
<p>Instead, all this cross-racial interaction that&rsquo;s been forced upon us is only confirming our forefathers&rsquo; suspiciions about racial differences: it teaches us that they are NOT the same as us. This study proves that this dynamic applies not just for &#8220;haters&#8221; like us at AmRen, but for the white population as a whole. </p>

In our own country, we shouldn&rsquo;t have to, but it&rsquo;s not exactly our country anymore.  We need to better understand our own feelings in order to be more persuasive to the brainwashed masses.<br>
     I don&rsquo;t have a sociological dissertation in me, but I can say that I like certain aspects of Mexican culture just as I like certain aspects of Japanese or Sioux or Spartan culture.  They are interesting in some ways, admirable or not, but none of them are my culture and they have no place here.  <br>
     My particular objection to Mexican culture is that it is simply a lower level of civilization.  Maintaining the physical and social infrastructure of our civilization calls for a degree of diligence that few Mexicans can muster.  They are, compared to Whites, careless, uninterested in education, tolerant of disorder, and content to just get by.  They cannot sustain what we have built.  What we see as squalor or decay is the high life to them, and they think us unreasonable to insist on First World standards.  There&rsquo;s a reason that Mexico is lawless and poor and that Japan, with far fewer resources, is not.  <br>

<p>ranger:  Do you find that the above comments are incorrect?  If you do, why not address why you think they are wrong instead of bringing up the ADL and the SPLC which have nothing to do with non-whites causing whites to unify?  Non-white organizations are <br>

<p>You are saying the ADL and the SPLC have few non-whites, so the argument pointing out non-white culpability is invalid, because it is those organizations who are solely to blame.</p>

Considering that MOST Americans are only too well aware that Hispanics come here to live off our welfare system, why would anyone think White-Hispanic relations are improving? The reality is WE KNOW Latinos tend to be parasites, living off our taxes!<br>

Fed Up, I concur with you 1000% on your statement but just remember this if nothing else:  It was your race of people who allowed these UNLAWFUL, UNWANTED ILLEGALS into this country in the first place and it&rsquo;s gonna have to be the whites like yourself who step up to the plate and eradicate this increasingly growing problem!  </p>

		<p>What hypocrites these demonstrating &amp; angry illegal Mexican aliens are:</p>
<p><i>&#8221;   &mdash;   The Mexican government will bar foreigners if they upset &#8220;the equilibrium of the national demographics.&#8221; How&rsquo;s that for racial and ethnic profiling?</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;   If outsiders do not enhance the country&rsquo;s &#8220;economic or national interests&#8221; or are &#8220;not found to be physically or mentally healthy,&#8221; they are not welcome. Neither are those who show &#8220;contempt against national sovereignty or security.&#8221; They must not be economic burdens on society and must have clean criminal histories. Those seeking to obtain Mexican citizenship must show a birth certificate, provide a bank statement proving economic independence, pass an exam and prove they can provide their own health care.</p>
<p>  &mdash;   Illegal entry into the country is equivalent to a felony punishable by two years&rsquo; imprisonment. Document fraud is subject to fine and imprisonment; so is alien marriage fraud. Evading deportation is a serious crime; illegal re-entry after deportation is punishable by ten years&rsquo; imprisonment. Foreigners may be kicked out of the country without due process and the endless bites at the litigation apple that illegal aliens are afforded in our country (see, for example, President Obama&rsquo;s illegal alien aunt   &mdash;   a fugitive from deportation for eight years who is awaiting a second decision on her previously rejected asylum claim).</p>
<p>  &mdash;   Law enforcement officials at all levels   &mdash;   by national mandate   &mdash;   must cooperate to enforce immigration laws, including illegal alien arrests and deportations. The Mexican military is also required to assist in immigration enforcement operations. Native-born Mexicans are empowered to make citizens&rsquo; arrests of illegal aliens and turn them in to authorities.</p>
<p>  &mdash;   Ready to show your papers? Mexico&rsquo;s National Catalog of Foreigners tracks all outside tourists and foreign nationals. A National Population Registry tracks and verifies the identity of every member of the population, who must carry a citizens&rsquo; identity card. Visitors who do not possess proper documents and identification are subject to arrest as illegal aliens.</p>
<p>All of these provisions are enshrined in Mexico&rsquo;s Ley General de Población (General Law of the Population) and were spotlighted in a 2006 research paper published by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Security Policy. There&rsquo;s been no public clamor for &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; in Mexico, however, because pro-illegal alien speech by outsiders is prohibited&#8221; </p>
