<h1>Illegal Alien Wins Defamation Case for Being Called a &#8216;Criminal&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kimberly Dvorak, Examiner.com, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An illegal-alien day laborer who attacked a U.S. photographer at a notorious San Diego day labor site in 2006, was awarded $2,500 in damages for &#8220;defamation per se&#8221; by Judge Ronald Styn in a non-jury trial in San Diego Superior Court.</p>
<p>The Mexican national plaintiff, Alberto Jimenez, who was illegally in the country at the time of the attack of Los Angeles photographer John Monti, sued San Diego Minutemen founder Jeff Schwilk for defamation for calling the illegal immigrant attackers &#8220;criminals&#8221; when he forwarded an email with Monti&rsquo;s pictures of Jimenez and six other suspects who were at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>Initially the lawsuit was filed in October 2007 and all seven men shown on the flyer sued Schwilk, Monti, and Fox News Corporation for defamation. However, Fox News and Monti were eventually dismissed from the case in 2008 and 2009 and six of the seven plaintiffs dropped their lawsuits against Schwilk in February, leaving only Jimenez vs. Schwilk for the one-day judge-only trial.</p>
<p>When the trial began, Jimenez was not in the courtroom to meet his accuser. Schwilk immediately asked Judge Styn for a directed verdict to dismiss the case, but the judge opted to start the trial without him and gave Jimenez additional time to appear in court as his attorney said he was running late. The plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney, Dan Gilleon, claimed his client was trying to get across the border and needed more time because he was a Tijuana, Mexico resident.</p>
<p>As testimony began Schwilk admitted that he had forwarded Monti&rsquo;s &#8216;wanted&rsquo; flyer by email the day after the attack. The email was sent to a dozen law enforcement and trusted community leaders so they could be on the lookout for the suspects who were still at large. He explained anyone with knowledge of these pictured men needed to notify San Diego Police Department.</p>
<p>The victim, Mr. Monti then testified that Jimenez was indeed one of the seven men who attacked him from &#8220;behind and knocked him into the busy boulevard that Saturday morning in 2006.&#8221; Monti explained he had gone to the day labor site to investigate the connection between the street-side illegal alien hiring site and child prostitution in the nearby the migrant camps where many of the day laborers live.</p>
<p>Monti also said under oath that Jimenez had previously testified in his criminal trial in 2007 that he was an illegal alien and had no legal papers to gain employment legally in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After a lunch break the defense called Jimenez to the witness stand, but Jimenez still had not arrived in court 4 1/2 hours after the start of the trial.</p>
<p>Gilleon then claimed that &#8220;Jimenez&rsquo; wife was having surgery and he could not attend the trial that day.&#8221; Judge Styn was clearly tired of the excuses, however he allowed the trial to continue. It became clear the real reason Jimenez could not come to the trial was because he was not eligible to enter the country legally from his home in Tijuana, Mexico. </p>
<p>Schwilk again asked Judge Styn for a directed verdict, but again the judge declined, he wanted to proceed with closing statements. Schwilk pointed out to the judge that he had a right to question his accuser and the judge seemed to agree, but he also wanted to conclude the trial without the plaintiff.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After a 15-minute recess, Judge Styn returned with his verdict finding Schwilk liable for one count of defamation for &#8220;carelessly&#8221; calling Jimenez a &#8220;criminal.&#8221; Schwilk plans to appeal.</p>
<p>Asked about the verdict, Schwilk said, &#8220;Judge Styn not only ruled against our protection of free speech, he is attempting to de-criminalize illegal aliens and the crimes they commit on American soil. Styn is yet another example of a bad judge attempting to legislate from the bench.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fellow San Diego Minuteman Barry Shipley observed the entire 5-hour trial and agreed. </p>
<p>&#8220;The judge completely ignored the court testimony that Jimenez was a criminal illegal alien and that the truth is a defense in a defamation case. Judge Styn should be removed from the bench,&#8221; Shipley explained. &#8220;He is a danger to our American Constitutional rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>The plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney Daniel Gilleon was obviously pleased with the outcome of the trial. &#8220;We are very pleased with Judge Ronald Styn&rsquo;s ruling. Once again, the Court system has shown that defamation is Schwilk&rsquo;s chief weapon in his &#8216;war&rsquo; against illegal immigration. The judgments against Schwilk are starting to pile up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schwilk saw it differently; &#8220;Of course La Raza and agents of the Mexican Government (Gilleon&rsquo;s employers) are pleased that they have been able to chip away at the U.S. First Amendment. Their greatest fear in the border and immigration debate is truth tellers like myself and other leaders fighting daily to secure America from the mass criminal invasion from Mexico. Unfortunately for them, they will never shut down our free speech&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Judge Styn should be removed from the bench</p>
<p>I think what people should pay attention to are the consequences of so many judges like this NOT being removed from the bench.</p>
<p>States have the ability to dissolve these courts.  Anger them enough and they will do so permanently.  Combined with many of them seeking to challenge the very validity of federal law itself, the potential exists to simply kick out all federal officers, judges and institutions lock stock and barrel.</p>
<p>The most radical part of the whole thing is the number of militias being raised under control of these states.  You have several states now openly stating that the purpose of these troops (and that is what they are&hellip;.not officers of the law but troops&hellip;.in much larger numbers than the current federal armed forces) is to guard against unwanted federal intrusion.</p>

		<p>So calling an illegal alien who assaults someone a &#8220;criminal&#8221; is defamation?  Hmmm.  If I call someone who commits first degree murder would that be defamation?  The judge should be removed.  Does Mr. Schwilk have a legal defense fund?<br>

		<p>Dear Judge Styn:  Is it or is in not illegal to cross the border illegally?  If it is indeed against the law to illegally cross the border, then doing so would make a person a criminal (i.e., one who commits an illegal act).  </p>
<p>Dear Judge Styn:  It seems that you do not have the foggiest idea about how the criminal system works.  I look forward to your recall by the citizens of California.</p>

		<p>I would suggest this Minuteman ignore this judges&rsquo; ruling just like this illegal invader ignores American immigration laws. Anarchy begets Anarchy.</p>

		<p>Just say NO! Ignore this judge&hellip;target him for impeachment.<br>
It is time for a fight. Let the message go out to the Liberal Activist/Legal Goon Squad that we have had enough and there<br>
actions will bring retribution.<br>
We are getting stronger by the day. Fight on.</p>

		<p>This ruling will not stand. SCOTUS has already ruled that illegal aliens are inelligible to sue for punitive damages and this idiot judge&rsquo;s award could in no way be construed to be compensatory damages.</p>

		<p>Remember the 1970s fictional TV movie &ldquo;QB-II&#8221;? The story involved a Polish doctor suing an author for defamation of character because the author identified him as the one who performed medical experiments on Jews in Nazi death camps.</p>
<p>The defense proved that what the author wrote was true. When the verdict, &#8220;We find for the plaintiff&hellip;&#8221; was announced by the jury, the whole courtroom gasped &hellip; that is, until the jury followed with, &#8220;&hellip;and award him one penny, the lowest coin in the realm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps $2,500 is all the judge thought the plaintiff&rsquo;s reputation was worth.<br>
