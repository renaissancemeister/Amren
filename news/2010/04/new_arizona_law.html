<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63P5WK20100426">New Arizona Law Forcing Hard Choices on Migrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Gaynor, Reuters, April 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With Arizona&rsquo;s crackdown on illegal immigrants looming, Guatemalan Samuel Roldan is swapping the family&rsquo;s battered Chevy Suburban, which he feels marks them out as low-income migrants, for a smarter, more corporate-looking Nissan.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have an old car (covered) with stickers for a Spanish-language radio station .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;s only logical that they will think you are Hispanic and you don&rsquo;t have papers,&#8221; Roldan said.</p>
<p>Roldan is among an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants in the Mexico border state carefully weighing their options on Monday, three days after Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed the United States&rsquo; toughest immigration measure into law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some like Roldan, 34, who has a steady job as a warehouse worker and three U.S.-born daughters in Phoenix schools, plan to stay put, lower their profile and wait to see how the law will affect them.</p>
<p>Others, like Mexican day laborer Jesus Aguilar, 52, say the measure leaves them few options but to leave Arizona and try their luck elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the law says that people hiring undocumented day laborers will get fined, no-one wants to (hire) us,&#8221; said Aguilar, who early on Monday was among some two dozen migrants touting for landscaping and building work at a day labor site in north Phoenix.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thinking of going to Utah or New Mexico.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here it is just too racist,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8216;CREATE HAVOC&rsquo;</p>
<p>The law has raised fears that Hispanics will be racially profiled and police will actively hunt down illegal immigrants, who are estimated to number about 10.8 million in the nation and are the backbone of the shadow economy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What is a father to do if, in 90 days, they can be stopped by any police officer and questioned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when their family is at home and their kids in school?&#8221; said Elias Bermudez, the founder of Phoenix nonprofit Immigrants Without Borders.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s going to create havoc, so a lot of them are saying, &#8216;Look, before they pick me up, I&rsquo;d rather leave the state of Arizona either to another state or back home,&rsquo;&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Migrants who spoke to Reuters on Monday said they would bide their time and see how the law is implemented in the next weeks and months before making their moves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Mexican day laborer Rodolfo Espinoza, meanwhile, it was simply time to go back home to work as a fisherman on the Pacific coast of northwest Mexico, where he has a wife and four children.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new law gives us no other option than to leave.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&rsquo;m going back to Mexico, where I feel more comfortable,&#8221; he added.<br>

		<p>I want to encourage all illegal aliens living in Arizona to come to San Francisco, CA.  We love immigrants, and especially undocumented workers.  In fact, we are a &#8220;Sanctuary City.&#8221;  This means that we will not examine your citizenship or deport you.  We also have a very generous welfare system that supplies virtually everything to undocumented international migrants, including living accommodations, health care, language instruction, free education, child care, job training, job search assistance, transportation, clothing allowance, legal aid, and of course food stamps.  Everything is free, and at no cost to you or your family. <br>
 <br>
Please come to San Francisco.  We value diversity and will welcome you with open arms.  </p>

		<p>I hope to God that the Arizona law spreads to the rest of the states, otherwise these parasites will move into my state. This law can only work if ALL the states are involved.</p>
<p>Too bad the MSM and our government leaders refuse to talk about the $338 billion annually we spend on illegal immigrants. Could you imagine what the USA could do with 338 billion cold cash &hellip; oh wait, our government would use it to attack Iran.<br>

How about going back to Mexico, where it isn&rsquo;t racist, instead of continuing to break the law elsewhere in the U.S.?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if there is no conception whatsoever that we don&rsquo;t have a policy of open borders.</p>

		<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t bother those here legally to be asked for their papers. It it will keep another American from being murdered by an illegal alien, it should be done. It is unthinkable that our own elected officials think it&rsquo;s an &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; law. I can only say how happy I am that no one now in charge in Washington was there on Dec. 7, 1941. They would have invited the enemy in to have tea and waved a white flag. Disgraceful!</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s forcing a hard choice on <i>criminals</i>: get out or go to jail. The free ride is over.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;For Mexican day laborer Rodolfo Espinoza, meanwhile, it was simply time to go back home to work as a fisherman on the Pacific coast of northwest Mexico, where he has a wife and four children.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>He has to go back to his wife and family?  Oh, no!  What a horrible punishment!  What hideous Racists those evil gringos are!</p>

<p>Oh what a pity that is, Criminal Invader Espinoza!</p>
<p>I could care less if he goes back to Mexico and feels &ldquo;more comfortable,&rdquo; or simply drowns himself  off the &ldquo;Pacific coast of northwest Mexico,&rdquo; and never feels anything again. He and his wellbeing are not my concerns; he is an invader, who deserves absolutely nothing, I repeat, absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>Moreover, his very presence here, aids an invasion of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; that is promoted by abjectly worthless traitors and Red terrorists in this country, that aggrandizes the genocide of whites as a goal of worth and &ldquo;honor.&rdquo;  Thus, his criminal activities are sustaining a nebulously coy and internal &ldquo;elite&rdquo; that thrives symbiotically on political &ldquo;factionalism&rdquo; in this country, and should be considered on his part, as exploitive attempts at seditious actions on behalf of a hostile and very foreign country, that we call Mexico. </p>
<p>Need I say more?</p>
<p>Of course and so as to not disappoint, God help us all!</p>

<p>&#8220;To another state,&#8221; probably, but &#8220;back home?&#8221;  Not hardly.  They won&rsquo;t begin to return to Mexico in any appreciable numbers until this economy drops down to serious levels and inflation increases the price of food to disasterous levels.</p>
<p>As has been mentioned on here many times, the only thing that might preserve a scant remnant of American culture is if this country plummets so low economically it is no longer possible for third world people to acquire jobs.</p>
<p>But, if it gets that low&hellip;which it is likely to do&hellip;.we&rsquo;ll break up or secede into ethnic areas.</p>

		<p>They can change up their style and public appearance all they want, because the odds of them getting pulled over and discovered for who they really are, or aren&rsquo;t, have not increased or decreased via this legislation. All this has done is give the state more power to enforce the EXISTING laws. The state also contains a huge amount of reservation land which the natives don&rsquo;t wish to see over run from those south of the Sonoran Desert. More is at stake than the national dailogue will mention at this point.</p>

		<p>I applaud the state of Arizona for showing some intestinal fortitude. Unfortunately though, I live in Las Vegas Nevada so I am sure we will see even more illegals swarming this city now. Nevada and other states wallowing in illegal immigration need to join Arizona and just swamp Washington with these new immigration laws. They wouldn&rsquo;t know what hit them or where to turn outside of maybe finally joining in and doing the job they should&rsquo;ve been doing in the first place, protecting this countries borders.</p>

		<p>This is just the media trying to trick people in arizona into thinking their law won&rsquo;t really change anything.</p>
<p>The truth is it&rsquo;s a total game changer.  Mexicans will flee arizona.  Where will they go?  Back to mexico?  Eventually yes.  But first they are will flood surrounding states and rapidly overload schools, hospitals, police and welfare.  Expect to see many other states pass similar laws (as the federal government fruitlessly and shamefully tries to stop them).  They really have no choice.  Many states have strong sentiment similar to arizona.  They were just waiting for another state to be the first to try this and are watching carefully to see what happens before copying them.  They want to see if it works.  A handful of states are run by leftist morons.  They will wait until the last before being forced to jump on the bandwagon.  They will be faced with a simple choice&hellip;.either push the mexicans out or become the dumping ground for the whole lot of them.  No state can handle that.  The turning point for this will be california.  Having dodged financial collapse for nearly a decade now, this will push them over the edge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that no matter what a state chooses, it will have pretty much the same effect.  Let&rsquo;s say california stubbornly digs its heels in and chooses to play host to mexicans no matter what.  Their institutions will collapse pretty quickly.  With no money from welfare pouring into the drug business, there is almost no reason for mexicans to be in california at all.</p>
<p>Very interesting pattern going on here.  A state forcing liberals to absorb the full impact of what their policies cause.  Without the ability to spread the costs (financial and otherwise) around equally, interest in promoting their policies will vanish.  That is the true point of what arizona is doing.  </p>
<p>Liberals are only generous with &#8220;other people&rsquo;s money&#8221; and other resources.  They are only tolerant when others bear the brunt of pain and suffering caused by what they do.  Force them to accept the consequences themselves and suddenly, they don&rsquo;t want these things anymore.</p>

		<p>So the moral of this story is&hellip;enforcement works.  The law hasn&rsquo;t even taken effect yet and the illegals can see the writing on the wall.  So what is this nonsense about &#8220;we can&rsquo;t get rid of 20 million illegals, we gotta legalize them&#8221;?</p>
<p>These folks aren&rsquo;t known for bravery.  If they were, they&rsquo;d stay home and fix their own countries.  Get serious about getting rid of them and we will see a mass exodus.  Start with ending anchor babies and that would be a huge step forward.</p>

SHADOW ECONOMY?<br>
Does the author refer here to the underming of our wage system, which is supposed to be protecting our own poor workers? To the violation of work safety laws because the illegals do not dare complain about unsafe working conditions, or are too ignorant to do so? To leaving illegals without workers&rsquo; compensation insurance coverage, meaning work-related injuries are taxpayer obligations? To the creation of a peasant underclass in what is supposed to be a republic of free men?<br>
It is about time that we stand up and BREAK THE BACKBONE of this<br>
SHADOW ECONOMY! <br>
I applaud this move by Arizona.</p>

<p>How&rsquo;s that for honesty? Even this guy recognizes that Hispanics are easily identified as stereotypes.</p>
<p>This law appears to be having the effect that a national law would. Just pass a law and give them time to leave. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t leave after the deadline can be jailed or deported. There&rsquo;s no reason to believe we have to catch, jail, and detain 12+ million Hispanics. Let them know what&rsquo;s coming and the majority will leave voluntarily.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t go back to Latin America, maybe they can all move to San Francisco and join the boycott of Arizona.</p>

		<p>This is unique and surprising how the state of Arizona actually did this and may pull it off.  Here you have Ocommie and his ilk on a relentless pace of transforming the government into some liberal freak wasteland and along comes Arizona and they say nope.  We don&rsquo;t have to stand idly by and watch you destroy our state.  We&rsquo;re going to do some in your face legislation of our own. </p>
<p>From what I can surmise this seems to be the most conservative non PC piece of work accomplished at the government level that I can recall in my lifetime.  Thanks Ocommie, maybe you have awakened the silent majority. </p>

		<p>This is great news!  The enactment of this Arizona law has caused the immigration issue to burst out into the open. It&rsquo;s on all the media, it&rsquo;s on facebook, it&rsquo;s on blogs, it&rsquo;s getting covered in the international media - and that can only help us.</p>

		<p>Okay, Mr. Immigrants Without Borders. Social welfare programs do have borders. They are, by definition, national. I hope you&rsquo;re willing to take your libertarian program to the next stage: the dismantling of federal social programs and the federal government itself. I also hope you&rsquo;re equally pushing for immigration of whites to Mexico and the disintegration of Mexican nationality so that I can retire rich without racist Mexican cops profiling me.</p>

		<p>Hey, if those &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; don&rsquo;t mind a bit of a drive from Arizona they can come to Illinois, to the biggest city, Cuidad de Chicago.  The Alcade, Ricardo M. Daley, will welcome them with open arms, they can move right into the Mayor&rsquo;s 11th Ward, get a good paying city job(where they&rsquo;ll earn more than 5% extra for just being able to speak their native tongue, Spanish, and be set for life.  We&rsquo;re a sanctuary city too, just like San Francisco.  The free education from Kindergarten thru high school is their&rsquo;s for the taking too, along with food stamps, Section-8 housing and free money for a down payment on that &#8216;American Dream&rsquo; of owning your own house.  Don&rsquo;t worry about not making the payments either, the Gringos will bail you out.  Feel a bit sick after that long drive from Arizona? Not wot worry, just go to any of our free City opreated clinics, s or if you need to be hospitalized, we&rsquo;ve got you covered there too. Hop on over to the County&rsquo;s Stroger Hospital where you&rsquo;ll find many of your countrymen.  Lots of them will be employed there under our Affirmative Action Awareds Program for minorities, (Diversity is our Strength).  Speak freely there too about your (I hate to use the phrase, Illegal Alien status, no such bothersome laws here like that one in Arizona.  Welcome to Aztlan.  </p>

		<p>The annual per capita murder rate in Mexico is over three times that of America.  </p>
<p>This statistic speaks volumes about the morality and character of the Mexican national.  </p>
<p>These are not people we want in our country under any circumstances.  </p>
<p>If Washington continues to refuse to empty this nation of Mexican illegals then the public will do it for them.  </p>
<p>And just let the communist usurpers in the White House and congress try and stop us&hellip;    </p>

		<p>21 Anon: The relevant comparison is not murder rates in the U.S. and Mexico, but of Whites and Mexicans.  Remember, over half the homicides in the U.S. are committed by Blacks, and another quarter by Hispanics.  And many police agencies, like the FBI, will sometimes count obvious mestizos as White.  Properly sorted out, in this country, Mexicans per capita commit over five times as many killings as Whites.  Who really knows the homicide rate in a lawless country like Mexico?  </p>

		<p>This just made a move to Flagstaff much more appealing.  The high altitude provides a real change of seasons, while proximity to Phoenix makes shopping convenient.</p>

		<p>I would pay $100 for ads in Arizona asking Illegals to come to San Francisco.  I would gladly contribute money for caravans of air-conditioned buses that would pick them up in Arizona and release them near City Hall in San Francisco.  I&rsquo;d even pay for lunch for each little bundle of Diversity and economic potential.  </p>
<p>The people of San Francisco LOVE immigrants!  Why should we continue to deny them the fulfillment of their fondest dreams.  I say, &#8220;Make a Wish Come True.&#8221;  Do your part to bring joy to the residents of that great city.  Help an internalization migrant find a new home in the &#8220;City by the Bay.&#8221;  Don&rsquo;t leave your heart in San Francisco, leave a Mexican! </p>

They will not go home until we make it impossible for them to live anywhere in the US or it&rsquo;s territories.<br>

<p>Then they will go to Canada. Or even to Europe (there are already lots of them there).<br>
They STILL won&rsquo;t go home!</p>
