			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luther Campbell, Miami New Times, April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>April means Major League Baseball&rsquo;s opening day, which gets me thinking about the media firestorm Los Angeles Angels center fielder Torii Hunter ignited last month when he called players from the Dominican Republic &#8220;imposters.&#8221; This reflected his opinion that dark-skinned Latin American major leaguers shouldn&rsquo;t be counted as blacks. He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>For quite some time, Major League Baseball has disenfranchised African-American kids. The scouts and owners have gone out and found players who look black, but to whom they can pay less money. Major League Baseball adopted this sweatshop mentality by targeting countries like the Dominican Republic, where players don&rsquo;t have a chance of being drafted or getting a scholarship right out of high school. A baseball team has to pay much more money to the African-American kid coming out of college than a kid from Santo Domingo or Puerto Plata. {snip}</p>
<p>How do the Florida Marlins manage to field a competitive team and keep the payroll low? Because the club has one of the best farm systems in Major League Baseball. They can get top-of-the-line Dominican players at a bargain price.</p>
<p>What Major League Baseball needs to do is reintroduce the sport to African-American children. Let&rsquo;s not forget the Negro Baseball League played a very important part of African-American people&rsquo;s history. {snip}</p>
<p>Even at the high school level, there is no effort to generate interest in baseball among teenage black boys. The owners need to put the resources in the inner cities because baseball is a beautiful sport.</p>
<p>But that is not in the plans. The plan is to eliminate black Americans and replace them with Dominicans.<br>

<p>Control of the media is an extremely powerful tool to brainwash the masses.  The percentage of blacks in professional sports greatly exceeds their percentage of the population.  And yet we are bombarded with stories like this bemoaning the fact that &ldquo;disenfranchised&rdquo; American blacks are 13% of the population, yet comprise only 10% of the players in major league baseball.     <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incredible that these conspiracy theory-esque accusations were able to be printed without any supporting evidence at all. The entire basis of this article is simply flat-out wrong; </p>
<p>&#8220;Major League Baseball adopted this sweatshop mentality by targeting countries like the Dominican Republic, where players don&rsquo;t have a chance of being drafted or getting a scholarship right out of high school. A baseball team has to pay much more money to the African-American kid coming out of college than a kid from Santo Domingo or Puerto Plata.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, both major and minor league baseball in America enforces a minimum salary. The contract of EVERY ball player pays somewhere near this minimum amount for their first year as a professional. If this author is going to make the surprising assertion that there is a large gap in the salaries of rookie baseball players based on race and nationality (to the extent of some players being paid &#8220;much more money,&#8221; in his words) then you&rsquo;d expect some research to back this claim up. Instead, we are just expected to just take his word on it.</p>
<p>Also, the reason why so many good baseball players come from the Dominican Republic can be much better explained by common sense than by any type of complex, hushed conspiracy theory among white MLB executives that the author is alluding to. The Dominican Republic is one of the very few countries where baseball is played almost exclusively. There is really no competition from any other sports there- boxing is a very distant second in popularity. It&rsquo;s not difficult to comprehend that a country where 100% of the athletic talent is spent entirely towards one sport would have a higher percentage of its population become professionals in that sport than a country where the athletic talent is divided among many different sports. Either that, or you could just take the author&rsquo;s word that a bunch of baseball executives sit around in darkened rooms and plot how to get players &#8220;who look black, but to whom they can pay less money.&#8221;</p>

If they&rsquo;re black Dominicans, then it&rsquo;s still diversity. They should be celebrating this enrichment.</p>

<p>If blacks had any guts they&rsquo;d demand that only native-born Americans be allowed to play in the Major Leagues; that would increase the number of black AND white players.</p>

		<p>It should be noted that Dominicans are mostly or partly black, for the most part.</p>
<p>As for the subject matter at hand, the reason for the paucity of blacks in baseball is that they&rsquo;re not interested in baseball, at least not enough to make careers of it.  There has been one war and two civil reconstructions in order to make black men free, and damned if they don&rsquo;t use their freedom to choose one thing over another for a profession.  </p>
<p>BTW, where is the NBA&rsquo;s herculean efforts to get more whites to play basketball?</p>

		<p>Say hay, Luther, what is the Ebonic term for &#8220;useful idiot&#8221;. Because that is how the new Minorities are using Blacks. You guys rioted and intimidated White leaders. The White leaders gave out massive tribute to &#8220;non-White males&#8221;. But now Blacks are being shoved to the back of the benefit line, behind Hispanics, Orientals, Africans, Arabs, etc. Better luck next time (if there is a next time).</p>

<p><br>
If it&rsquo;s such an important part of black history, then why do you need a bunch of white team owners to reintroduce it to black kids?  Why don&rsquo;t blacks encourage their own without demanding whitey come in and fix it for them?  </p>
<p>Where are the black fathers introducing baseball to their sons?  Oops, nevermind!  I see the problem now&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all about economics.</p>
<p>This is no different that the practice in the 19th century of importing Chinese contract labor as a less expensive, more reliable labor force than the Irish. Or, compare it to the use of immigrants to replace New England natives in the fabric industry during the during the turn of the last century. Tariffs are one of the oldest burning issues in the country. Do we wish to tariff imports of baseball players, as we did and do other goods? The economic status of the American black increased after the 1922 exclusions acts kept out competition and American business were finally obliged to &#8216;throw down your lunch pail where you are&rsquo; and hire native blacks.</p>

		<p>Off subject. I&rsquo;m trying to study Negro League baseball. Everywhere I look on this subject, I run into blind alleys. The subject has no depth. You can&rsquo;t get at any meat. I&rsquo;m very suspicious of the whole idea of the Negro Leagues. There&rsquo;s so much not accounted for. There&rsquo;s an old saying in sports, &#8220;You are what your record is.&#8221; That&rsquo;s just it, there are no records. Everything is nothing but hearsay. Even the idea of the word &#8220;league.&#8221; You have to give broad leeway to that word when you use it in conjunction with the idea of Negro Leagues. Here&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;ve found out. The owner of the Kansas City Monarchs, J.L. Wilkinson was a White Man, one of the best run Negro League teams ever. Another White man who helped black teams get playing sites and arranged games for them in the NE area was a man named Nat Strong. There was quite a significant amount of White influence in the Negro Leagues. I&rsquo;d go so far to say that for the most part, if it wasn&rsquo;t for White people, there would never have been such a thing as the Negro Leagues.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m just beginning this study, so I&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of this mystery.</p>

		<p>Luther, if white people had any guts you would have been dealt with legally and expunged from anywhere close to decent society.  The only thing you &#8220;bruthas&#8221; have is what the idiot and weak white man have granted you, and now you want to riot against people who won&rsquo;t give you anything? </p>
<p>This should be good&hellip;welcome to diverse America, Luther.</p>
<p>The ship of fools has trickled down and now the fools rule. </p>

		<p>To poster 3.  This is, my friend, the answer we all need to embrace.  The Romans and the British used divide and conquer tactics.  This is a well-worn, time-tested tactic of white empire builders.  Divide them by pointing out their own inconsistencies.  </p>
<p>You cannot call for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in someone else&rsquo;s space without being willing to accept in your own.</p>
