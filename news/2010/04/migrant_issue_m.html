<h1>Migrant Issue May Haunt Main Parties at UK Poll</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stefano Ambrogi, Reuters, April 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Opinion polls show [immigration] to be the second most important issue after the economy for voters nationally ahead of a May 6 election  &mdash;  more pressing even than crime, health or education. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think Britain and its multiculturalism is wonderful. But we need to have better controls,&#8221; said Zubair Zafar, 34, a British Muslim from a Pakistani family working on a stall selling Islamic garments and literature in Barking&rsquo;s market. </p>
<p>&#8220;No one is checked and vetted before they come in. White indigenous people are feeling oppressed in their own country and I don&rsquo;t blame them. Down the road there could be riots here.&#8221; </p>
<p>Zafar, who has always voted Labour, said he would probably vote Conservative, turned off by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also by Labour&rsquo;s social policies. </p>
<p>The main parties have been reluctant to confront the issue. Political analysts say that is down to fears it could backfire and cost precious votes in one of the most tightly fought general elections in 20 years. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Labour government knows it cannot deliver the policy the vast majority want, because that is no immigration and that is not possible,&#8221; said Prof. Robert Ford, a political sociologist at Manchester University. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s neither economically sensible nor is it legislatively feasible to stop  &mdash;  so they are not inclined to start talking about a subject where they know they are very much at odds with the public.&#8221; </p>
<p>For the opposition Conservatives, Ford says, it comes down to a perception they lost voters when they talked it up at the 2005 election, which they lost. </p>
<p>&#8220;They equate talking about it with intolerance and race prejudice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a belief that if they launch the debate then it panders to the image of them being labeled (in the words of a former Conservative minister) the &#8216;nasty party&rsquo;  &mdash;  an image they are desperate to shake off.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The influx has also brought accusations by opposition parties that Labour has lost control of the numbers entering Britain. It&rsquo;s a charge Labour denies, but is still keen to be seen to be addressing with what it calls stricter controls. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p><strong>RISE OF THE FAR RIGHT</strong> </p>
<p>In Barking, once a safe Labour parliamentary constituency, tension over the issue has paved the way for the far-right British National Party (BNP) to gain considerable ground. </p>
<p>The BNP says it wants to stop the &#8220;mass immigration invasion.&#8221; </p>
<p>In the 2005 election the anti-immigration party won 17 percent of the popular vote in the constituency, its best ever result, and it won 11 of the 51 local council seats in 2006. </p>
<p>This time, buoyed by winning two seats in last year&rsquo;s European elections, the party&rsquo;s leader Nick Griffin is standing as a candidate in Barking to try and secure its first parliamentary seat. </p>
<p>John Pacey, 42, a painter and decorator from the nearby constituency of Dagenham which the BNP is also contesting, said he would be voting for them. </p>
<p>&#8220;No one gets anything around here mate and they (migrants) get everything,&#8221; he said, gesturing at the passing crowds. </p>
<p>Anti-fascist organization Searchlight says the BNP intends to contest more seats than ever before, beating the 303 candidates its predecessor the National Front fielded in the 1979 vote which swept Conservative Margaret Thatcher to power. </p>
<p>Analysts say the reluctance of the main parties to properly engage voters on immigration could see the BNP and other minor parties capture floating voters. </p>

		<p>Funny ole place Barking and Dagenham, I worked there for a housing association, an organisation that supplys low cost housing to working class people, opposition to immigrants was running high. Although no one would say anything openly.</p>
<p>Who can blame them ? Theres a lie peddled about by politician that immigrants werent getting taking houses from local people but all I saw were immigrants getting houses on private rents at around £550 pw, paid for by the state. </p>
<p>£70 (average council rent) was paid by the council in benefits the rest came from the local Social services asylum team making the balance up. Most people dont know that and thats why when asked councillors will say that teh benefits system isnt paying the rent.</p>
<p>Locals wouldnt get the rents paid on these places as they werent considered to be in need (?!). This is turn pushed up prices of rents as landlords could ask higher figures, further pushing out whites and encouraging in immigrants. </p>
<p>Landlords also equipped these houses as part of the agreements.</p>
<p>I worked with BNP here and joined up shortly afterwards. </p>
<p>Fingers crossed for an all BNP dagenham</p>

		<p>Well I am voting BNP.</p>
<p>A vote for any of the main parties and that now includes Lib dems is a vote for mass imigration.</p>
<p>Lib Dems want an amnesty for illegal imigrants. They just jumped Labour in most polls because of a TV appearance by their leader. But nobody knows what they stand for.</p>
<p>The UK is doomed.</p>

		<p>The fact that the Labour Party and Conservative Party are both too cowardly to even mention the immigration issue is actually good news for the BNP. Many people who view immigration as a big concern and would otherwise vote Labour or Conservative are going to vote BNP, because the BNP is the only party with the balls to oppose being made minorities in their own country because of mass immigration from the Third World.</p>

<p>God forbid that a political party would ever actually address someting of concern to the voters.  No, instead it is simpley better to talk about &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;change&#8221; and other vauge, feel-good empty phrases.</p>
<p>It is better to simply ignore problems.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s neither economically sensible nor is it legislatively feasible to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once again the big lie!  In fact, stopping unlimited immigration of low-skilled unassimilatable Third Worlders is absolutely ESSENTIAL to preventing economic collapse.  Furthermore, it can be legislatively accomplished with a single voting, and implemented in a single day.  </p>
<p>If it can&rsquo;t be done, then how does Japan do it?  </p>

		<p>Far Right?  The BNP are more socialist than Labour when it comes to economics, and greener than the greens when it comes to the environment.  The only thing &#8216;right&rsquo; about them are their policies on crime and immigration.</p>
<p>The BNP is either a centre-left or a centre-right party depending on which issues are of greater importance to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that white brits at least have a choice when it comes to voting to avert their race suicide, where&rsquo;s ours?</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon Jared, run for office.  I&rsquo;ll vote for you.  &#8220;The American Ren. Party,&#8221; is catchy, you have to admit.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I think Britain and its multiculturalism is wonderful But we need to have better controls,&rdquo; said Zubair Zafar, 34, a British Muslim from a Pakistani-</p>
<p>So I gather that ole Zubair wouldn&rsquo;t mind if millions of Chinese or Africans invaded his homeland in Pakistan and displaced his family then. And by the way, there&rsquo;s no such thing as a British MUSLIM!!!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s neither economically sensible nor is it legislatively feasible to stop-</p>
<p>WHAT!!!! It&rsquo;s not &#8220;economically sensible&#8221; to stop even more leeches from comming to Britain and getting on the dole? Who does the math over there? It isn&rsquo;t &#8220;legislatively feasible&#8221; to stop? It WOULD be feasible to stop if there were some REAL men\women running the show. The &#8220;leaders&#8221; in Britain AND here in the U.S. need to &#8220;grow some rocks&#8221;. </p>
<p>God bless the BNP!!! <br>

<p>The same reluctance to engage the public in discussions about immigration can be found in Canada, the U.S., and Europe.  Governments want immigration policy to remain behind closed doors, out of sight, out of mind.</p>

		<p>There is a great deal of barely cincealed anger in Britain about New Labour&rsquo;s &#8216;open door&rsquo; immigration policy that has resulted in massive, uncontrolled replacement immigration.<br>
 The politicians know this, and all the political parties know that if properly exploited the immigration issue holds the key to power to Westminster.<br>
 BUT there is an unspoken agreement amongst the three major political parties to deliberately ignore and underplay immigration so that it melts away from the agenda.By and large this policy works for the political class and has worked for the ast 40 years (despite massive public anger and disagreement on immigration).At root it is a function of Britain&rsquo;s non-representatve voting system that polarizes power in a two party duopoly.<br>
 The irony is that the opposition Conservatives had a golden opportunity to make an unassailable lead over the others by exploiting the issue - but they muffed it, which happens to be good for the BNP.</p>

		<p>UKIP and BNP should do better than the last time. Interestingly the MSM, even the lefty BBC, has actually been attacking one of the parties for supporting amnesty and for it being a looney policy. Thats why in Europe there is always hope.<br>
Moving in the right direction but we are only a small way there, much more work to do.</p>

		<p>Since when does Rueters stoop to taking quotes from a bunch of activist thugs like &lsquo;Searchlight&rsquo;, instead of more credible political scientists?</p>
<p>Since when does the American MSM (mainstream media) stoop to taking quotes from a bunch of activist thugs like SPLC, instead of from more credible objective sources?</p>
<p>Well, since forever.  Since the 1960&rsquo;s and the founding of this ripoff organization, anyway.  Since the SPLC spouts all the accepted and desired liberal anti-white propaganda approved by the liberal and marxist elites who rule us.  Since the MSM came out of the closet and no longer cares that it is obvious they are completely biased to the leftward and always have been.  I&rsquo;d imagine it&rsquo;s pretty much the same in Britain, though they are ahead of us in the drive to replace freedom loving rebellious whites with third world controllable (they think) aliens.  Always remember the central connection to the chaos they are implementing - you can&rsquo;t justify a complete takeover by totalitarianists until complete chaos and financial collapse is the existing condition.  All these liberal policies are geared toward creating that chaos and economic collapse.  Unlimited third world immigration speeds up the process of social chaos and economic collapse.  </p>

<p>Down the road? Does this guy even live in England? He must not get out much. His own countrymen riot with complete impunity, calling for the death of Britain and the US.</p>
