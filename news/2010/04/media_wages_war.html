<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Historically black women have been portrayed as ignorant, loud, lascivious and harsh toned, swivel-necked hens. We&rsquo;ve also been depicted as intimidating and unapproachable figures. Now the media is attacking us for being single. According to the media if you&rsquo;re a successful black woman with standards, you may just not &#8220;get a ring on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Articles like &#8220;Black Women Should End the Blame Game&#8221;, generalize the complaints of why so many black women are unmarried. The article on thegrio.com states that black women&rsquo;s standards are too unreasonable, a sentiment echoed in a various publications, including Essence magazine, which is by and supposedly for black women. Hard to believe that one of the goals of Essence magazine is to empower black women when they run articles suggesting black women engage in acts of desperation and go to strip clubs to meet men. {snip}</p>
<p>Even mainstream media outlets like ABC&rsquo;s Nightline are adding all kinds of combustible fuel to the fire with their feature titled, &#8220;Why Can&rsquo;t Successful Black Women Find Men&#8221;. Gee ABC, thanks so much for your concern and for coming up with a title suggesting there&rsquo;s something wrong with being successful and single-and that it&rsquo;s only a black problem. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} It&rsquo;s as if the media at large is saying: &#8220;Listen black girls, first we&rsquo;re going to do our best to make you feel unworthy and unlovable. And when you prove us wrong and lead happy, emotionally healthy and empowered lives, we&rsquo;re going to bombard you with messages indicating all that education and self affirmation will backfire, because no decent black man will want you now! {snip}&#8221; {snip} [This] strategy of attacking self actualized black women is not the answer.</p>
<p>Jimi Izrael, who was also on the Nightline panel and Harper both suggest that most black women are looking for an ideal black man. Izrael says, &#8220;Women are looking for men who don&rsquo;t exist,&#8221; and Harper says 95% of black women are looking for the top 10% of men. {snip} Izrael says black women want a Denzel Washington fantasy and wrote a book, The Denzel Principle, {snip}, and goes on to spout the ridiculousness that &#8220;All black women think they&rsquo;re Michelle Obama.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insulting to say all black women lack a realistic and compassionate view of what it takes to have a substantive relationship. And since the frame of the conversation regards successful black women, the mere fact a black woman has worked hard to create a bountiful life for herself completely disproves the theory she&rsquo;s waiting on a man to save her. Mr. Izrael please check your perspective (or just talk to more black women) on what you think black women want.</p>
<p>If in fact the success of single black women will inhibit their ability to find a black mate, the media should shift the focus and examine the security/commitment issues of the black men who are supposedly so intimidated and address the socio-economic/political and psychological factors that play into a black man&rsquo;s feelings of emasculation when confronted with a &#8220;strong black&#8221; woman. Black women should not be vilified and victimized for creating good lives for themselves.</p>
<p>So single black women, keep achieving and keep it moving. A good man wants a good woman  &mdash;  period. Do not take to heart the shallow criticisms and explanations of the media and its players. It&rsquo;s all game and propaganda to again try and trick us into believing we are unlovable. {snip}.<br>

								<h2>I&rsquo;m Black, Single and Insulted</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jeneé Osterheldt. Kansas City Star, April 27, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Successful, single black women  &mdash;  it seems we&rsquo;re the new hot topic for the media.</p>
<p>Ever since that Newsweek story years ago, where it was declared that 42.4 percent have never married, the discussion never ends.</p>
<p>They say we&rsquo;re alone because we climb the corporate ladder faster than black men, we&rsquo;re better educated and creating a gap.</p>
<p>When that story broke, I was in my early 20s. My girlfriends and I freaked out and fed into a season of paranoia, bad decisions and premature anxiety about marriage and children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some say we&rsquo;re too picky. Others say we need to look at other men. Most point to the lack of good black men. I&rsquo;ve seen stories questioning why we can&rsquo;t find a man and if marriage is no longer the &#8220;in&#8221; thing for blacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insulting.</p>
<p>And then there was last week&rsquo;s &#8220;Nightline Face-Off&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;Why Can&rsquo;t a Successful Black Woman Find a Man?&#8221;  &mdash;  featuring a panel of men and women unsuccessfully reaching a resolution.</p>
<p>This is not a new conversation. The numbers haven&rsquo;t changed. Just stop it already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done believing the hype. Most of those friends I had when the study came out are married now. And what about my black girlfriends in interracial relationships? Don&rsquo;t they count as black women in love? {snip}</p>
<p>We are not sad, pathetic, desperate women. Yet these stories paint us that way.</p>
<p>Stop talking down to me and the women I know. We don&rsquo;t need to be fixed.</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to anyone that these unmarried women are happy? Some enjoy the single life. What about those of us who haven&rsquo;t walked down the aisle yet but are in healthy relationships? {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s a little more complicated for a woman of color  &mdash;  there are almost 2 million more black women than black men. But let&rsquo;s not act as if there are no good black men. There are good black men just as there are good men of all races. {snip}</p>
<p>Yet I feel the need to stand up for black men. The women are unfairly tinted as go-getters with impossibly high standards. But the men get labeled as underachievers, dogs, absent. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}<br>

<p>Oh jeez, I just spewed soda all over my laptop.</p>
<p>Just leave the white men alone.</p>
<p>For that matter, white men I know would not give a black women a second look.  Their foul talking, churlish &#8220;Jersey Shore&#8221; behavior, combined with their predisposition to promiscuity and the ever present obnoxious &#8220;its all about me&#8221; attitude, should <br>
be a turn off for ANY man. </p>
<p>The sad truth is the majority of black men are too lazy, unintelligent and violence prone to amount to anything.  Short of being sperm donors, they are useless to any woman. Black women know this and resent it.</p>

		<p>Any White person with 2 eyes and ears and in touch with reality  and living in a big city cannot avoid seeing and hearing the behavior of Black women and Blacks in general.  </p>
<p>Black females are the most overweight group in this country and most likely in the world.  (See CDC stats) The average 40 year old Black woman hovers around 190 pounds.  It&rsquo;s absolutely incredible.  Anyone who has been around Blacks in a big city as I have probably knows the loud, aggressive un-feminine behavior exhibited by a large percentage of Black women.  When the percentage of Blacks in any situation reaches a certain point, they begin to show their true colors.  The first thing that they usually do is they start to bump into you and violate your personal zone of space - if you&rsquo;re White.  The behave in an arrogant and obnoxious manner.  I&rsquo;ve seen Black women actually fighting like men, that is, punching with a closed fist like a man.  These types of Black women are not afraid of White women because White women can&rsquo;t fight like men; White women are too feminine.  And White women I believe are currently morally disarmed in the sense that they collectively have a guilt complex.  They find it hard to even battle with words for fear of appearing &#8220;racist&#8221;.  This of course is true of White men as well.  The stereotype of Black women is more than accurate.</p>

<p>Grant it I don&rsquo;t read black magazines but I have NEVER seen the media imply that! The implication is these women do not WANT black thugs so they end up single.  </p>
<p>We all know the average black guy would LOVE to hook up with a black career woman that will provide for him and let him hit all the booty he can on the side. I have met too many poor black women that work their tails off to support worthless black male &#8220;husbands&#8221;. </p>

<i>Historically black women have been portrayed as ignorant, loud, lascivious and harsh toned, swivel-necked hens.</i></p>
<p>They have been portrayed as such because they largely are.</p>
<p>One obvious reason some black men prefer white women is because of the way black women &#8216;portray&rsquo; themselves. The &#8216;attitude&rsquo; gets tiresome very quickly.<br>

		<p>To black women who are angry about this article and to quote your beloved Malcom X; &#8220;The chickens have come home to roost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black women have whole-heartedly backed the very welfare programs that made black men insignificant and unnecessary.  All inner city black women want today is a sperm donor. The government will pick up the tab for little Jamal or Shaniqua - lots of them.  </p>
<p>That a majority of black males gravitate toward gratifying their impulses first, and learning a skill somewhere else far down the priority list is because they have, again, been made insignificant by your beloved welfare state. And black women, as a group, have sex on impulse as well.  Stigma-free living is they way of the black &#8220;community&#8221;.  After all, to blacks it&rsquo;s &#8220;too white&#8221; to have personal rules, boundaries, and values that eventually pay great life dividends and are enduring.   </p>
<p>Love that hip-hop, gansta, immediate gratification culture where women are commonly called, bitches? So do the bruthas, and you&rsquo;re probably the first ones saying, &#8220;it&rsquo;s a black thing, part of our street culture&#8221;. Rap on, sista. </p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve witnessed too many times in regard to how so many black women treat black men.  Black women can be verbally castrating to a black man at the drop of a hat. And they&rsquo;re willing to do so in public.</p>
<p>This is the black male world the majority of black women have supported with their voices, vices, and their votes.  You wanted it, sistas, and you got it.   </p>

		<p>You must admit, this woman is correct in many ways. A successful intelligent black woman (half breed) cannot find a decent black man to marry, since they are abusive, ignorant, and criminal. This leaves her with crossing the race barrier to find an appropriate mate. </p>

		<p>I am amazed, neither of these rants explitly blamed White men for Black women&rsquo;s problems. A competent feminist would have done so. If a feminist can blame White men for causing a Black man to rape her, she could blame White men for Black women&rsquo;s lack of men. </p>
<p>How? The feminist would point out that in a Racist society, Black men have low self esteem. They transfer this to Black women and this reduces their attraction to Black women. Since White men are the cause of Racism, they are the cause of Black women&rsquo;s lack of romance. QED.</p>

<p>I agree with you. Many well educated Black women do not have an abundance of suitable Black men to choose from, thus a number often will date or marry outside of their race. </p>
<p>My younger brother has a friend in his early 40s, a Princeton grad, class of &#8216;89 who married a Black woman (she is a UCLA Law Grad) and they have two children. His first marriage to a White woman from Wyoming ended in divorce. They live in Colorado. This situation is becoming more and more commonplace.</p>

		<p>I would think that UNsuccessful black women face even greater problems getting a husband or even a boyfriend who isn&rsquo;t juggling 10 other women on the side.  #3 is absolutely right.  Many black men are eager to marry or live with a woman who will support them  &mdash;  while they continue to behave like carefree bachelors.  </p>

<p>Where I work, there is one black woman.  She is Haitian, but was raised here.  She is so full of &#8216;tude it&rsquo;s absolutely unreal.  She freely shouts, raises her voice, gets all &#8216;ghetto&rsquo;, makes threatening moves towards others (fake punches, fighting postures, etc), throws things, and she gets away with it BECAUSE of the stereotype.</p>
<p>In other words, everyone, my boss (a woman) included, assumes that this is how black women act, so no one says anything about her behavior.  It&rsquo;s really quite amusing and entertaining and neither I nor anyone else would ever dream of calling her out on it.  Ironically, we have one black guy who works here, very metrosexual, who freely calls her out all the time for her boorish behavior.  (They hate each other).</p>
<p>This is my current experience with stereotypical black female behavior.  My previous place of employment had three black women there.  One was older and a loud militant anti-white southern diva.  One was raised in the suburbs and was really quite a pleasant person.  The third was from Jamaica and was equally nice and well-mannered, but she often would publicly lament that there were no good black men to be found.</p>
<p>So I do agree that some very loud black owmen do ruin it for others.  I don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with black men and their behavior except for what I&rsquo;ve seen from afar, which isn&rsquo;t very positive overall.  The question becomes then why they are not sticking up for their women and marrying them.</p>

<p>Why do I think &#8216;self-actualized&rsquo; means knowing one should blame white men for all problems in history, and their continuation in the present. I have a sneaky suspicion that&rsquo;s true. And that for every woman and non-white on this Earth, that is the answer.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that marriage-worthy black men are hard to find&hellip;even with a good education, which is a rare thing among brothas, many are ex-cons with a rap sheet and can&rsquo;t find employment. Besides that, many are immature, violent man/child street hustlers, lacking in responsibility, self-discipline, and family values. They live for the next high and any ho that will go with them&hellip;</p>

<p>Once I saw an episode of Divorce Court that featured a black man and a white woman divorcing.  I kid you not, the husband had a poster board listing reasons why he preferred white women.  At the top of the list  &mdash;  white women are easier to control.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not normal for any race to prefer mates of a different race.  This has nothing to do with the quality (or percieved quality) of the mates.</p>
<p>What is going on here is widespread media manipulation and brainwashing (and it takes quite alot of it to convince someone to cross this racial barrier for any length of time).</p>
<p>The real issue here is not miscegenation&hellip;..it&rsquo;s who is pushing miscegenation.</p>

		<p>I know it is not saying much but black women are better than black men.</p>
<p>At least some of the women make an effort to go the school and find steady employment.</p>
<p>Black women have made some modest progress.</p>

		<p>I do laugh when I read that black women are not attracted to white men.</p>
<p>Black women who are at the bottom of the dating totem pole are not attracted to the most successful group in world history? </p>
<p>But they are interested in black men who have no loyalty in return.</p>
<p>I guess it is easy to say you are not attracted to white men when you know they aren&rsquo;t going to approach you anyway.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.<br>
There was a report about why blonds are blonds: It has not to do so much with the sun but with the better looking of white people. <br>
The reason is this: Only in Europe and Caucasian regions there were more women than men. It was the only place on earth were men were able to decide which women they wanted. And they only wanted the one with more estrogen and the brighter once. And of course only the good looking once.</p>
<p>I really couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes that German PC media brought this, but they never brought it again and even erased it from their website.</p>

		<p>I agree with this commentator: black women are lovable. The problem isn&rsquo;t black people, it&rsquo;s diversity.</p>
<p>Our media has systematically distorted every type of person it has encountered, replacing them with idealized stereotypes that bear little relation to reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise they have also failed to find a way to embrace black women except Halle Berry.</p>

<p>The fact is that the media has embraced a number of Black women - Halle Berry, Robin Givens, Vanessa Williams, Oprah Winfrey, Angela Bassett, Stacy Dash, Lele Rochon, Alfre Woodard, Zoe Saldana, Rutina Wesley, Amber Riley, Whoopi Goldberg, Shari Shepherd just to name a few.</p>

		<p>Stereotypes are quite often(not always, but often) stereotypes for a reason. </p>
<p>What limited contact I have with black women(and I do try to keep it limited) is that they are loud, obnoxious and have way too much attitude.</p>
<p>I think the truth about black women in regards to the men they&rsquo;re looking for is simply the same as white women, they want a man who&rsquo;s educated, intelligent and not a violent criminal.  Guess which race has very very few men of that description.</p>

		<p>I sometimes think black woman (at least many of them) accept and expect to be abused. I can think of times at places where I&rsquo;ve worked where the issue has come up, and there was a strange silence and lack of any indignation.  Almost indifference!  Whites would have been outraged.  Blacks were silent.  It was very strange. It made me wonder just what DO they want, anyway?</p>
