<h1>Latino Growth Hurts GOP</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Wall, Sun (San Bernardino), April 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As San Bernardino County becomes increasingly Latino, the political fortunes of the Republican Party have dimmed. </p>
<p>While the percentage of immigrants in the county has more than doubled over the past three decades, the share of the Republican vote in presidential elections has continued to drop, according to a new study. </p>
<p>&#8220;The immigrant influx in California has politically realigned the state,&#8221; said the study&rsquo;s author, James Gimpel, a government professor at the University of Maryland, College Park. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no question that the very, very large volume of international migrants in Southern California counties has altered the political complexion of the state to favor the Democratic Party.&#8221; </p>
<p>In 1980, less than 8 percent of San Bernardino County residents were born outside the United States. By 2008, that figure topped 18 percent. </p>
<p>At the same time, the percentage of the county electorate voting Republican in presidential elections declined from nearly 60 percent in 1980 to less than 46 percent in 2008. </p>
<p>The same trend is occurring across the nation in counties with large populations where most immigrants settle, Gimpel said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College, agreed with Gimpel&rsquo;s analysis. </p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration has not been a political asset to Republicans,&#8221; Pitney said. &#8220;They have the difficult political challenge of threading a political needle. On the one hand, supporting a strong fight against illegal immigration. But on the other hand, supporting measures to sustain legal immigration, particularly of skilled workers.&#8221; </p>
<p>Pitney said Republicans have little to gain by backing immigration reform proposals that provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>&#8220;It just doesn&rsquo;t make political sense,&#8221; Pitney said. &#8220;Latinos are not going to flock to the Republicans even if they support amnesty, but the Republican base will be alienated.&#8221; </p>
<p>In California, it hasn&rsquo;t been easy for Republicans to overcome the legacy of Proposition 187, a ballot measure approved by voters in 1994 that cut off public services to illegal immigrants but was overturned by the courts. </p>
<p>Analysts say the harsh rhetoric used to promote the initiative turned off many Latino voters, harming the party&rsquo;s efforts to win their support in future elections. </p>

								<h2>Wooing Latinos Proves Tricky for GOP</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Tom Benning, Dallas Morning News, April 19, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Two Hispanic candidates romped to victory in Republican congressional runoffs last week, just a little more than a month after Texas&rsquo; highest-ranking Hispanic officeholder blamed his GOP primary loss on bias against Hispanics.</p>
<p>The conflicting election results highlight the GOP&rsquo;s uneven results in fostering successful Hispanic candidates over the years, despite repeated efforts to do so as a way of reaching out to the fast-growing demographic.</p>
<p>Political experts say the GOP has had two recurring problems: inconsistency in its courtship of Hispanics and occasional setbacks from problems such as inflammatory rhetoric on immigration.</p>
<p>But on the heels of Railroad Commissioner Victor Carrillo&rsquo;s loss to an unknown opponent last month, the congressional runoff victories by Bill Flores in Central Texas and Francisco &#8220;Quico&#8221; Canseco in South Texas complicate the question of whether Republicans can regularly win Hispanic votes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A majority of Hispanics, particularly in the Southwest, have long voted for and identified with the Democratic Party. Exit polls from the 2008 presidential election showed that about two-thirds of Latinos in the country voted for Barack Obama, and polling by the Pew Hispanic Center shows consistent majority Hispanic support for Democrats over the last decade. </p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean Hispanics are a static voting bloc. Political experts said George W. Bush was especially effective as a governor in reaching out to conservative Hispanics in Texas, and a recent poll commissioned by a national group of Hispanic legislative leaders showed that many Hispanics identify themselves as conservatives, especially on social issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Latino population today is not the same as it was in the 1970s and 1980s,&#8221; said Sylvia Manzano, an expert on Latino politics at Texas A&M; University. &#8220;The composite parts are different. So Latinos don&rsquo;t necessarily have the frame of reference that they owe a loyalty or some indebtedness to a particular party.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to prove what role ethnicity played in the victories by congressional candidates Flores and Canseco, who beat non-Hispanic opponents in GOP runoffs Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>GOP Is for Me</strong></p>
<p>As Flores and Canseco face tough general election contests against incumbent Democrats Chet Edwards and Ciro Rodriguez, others across Texas are trying to spread a Hispanic brand of conservatism from the ground up. Duke Machado, president of a group called GOP Is for Me, is encouraging the creation of Hispanic Republican Clubs throughout the state.</p>
<p>Machado said that there are certainly still people who are uncomfortable voting for a Hispanic politician but that a victory such as Flores&rsquo; proves voters don&rsquo;t base decisions solely on ethnicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not in the name,&#8221; Machado said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s in the person. They voted for him because he provided solutions.&#8221;<br>

The belief that Hispanics would naturally gravitate to the GOP came from Reagan and the Cuban exile communities of south Florida.</p>
<p>Reagan talked tough to Castro and the Cubans ate it up. This one group experience doesn&rsquo;t carry over to other Hispanic groups and never will.</p>
<p>I read that Cuban support for the GOP in Florida has fallen below 50% so any gain 30 years ago didn&rsquo;t create any lasting affect.</p>

		<p>Certainly, it would be the GOP&rsquo;s best interest (and possibly its survival as a political party) to curb the tide of mass Hispanic immigration, legal or otherwise, to the United States of America.</p>
<p>John McCain alienated his base by obstinately supporting amnesty for 12,000,000 to 20,000,000 illegal aliens, most of whom are Hispanic, unlawfully residing in our country. Unsurprisingly, Hispanics voted for Obama 2 to 1. John McCain lost votes from his base and gained nothing from pandering to Hispanics.</p>
<p>Is it not clear to the Republican Party that Hispanics are mostly inclined towards the Democratic Party, and that having more of them in the USA will only diminish its influence as a political party?</p>

<p>No kidding Comrade Manzano!</p>
<p>Indeed, in the 1970s Hispanics were about 4% of the population, and in the 1980s they were about 8% of it at the most. What are they now, about 14% to 15% of it?</p>
<p>The Republicans, have allowed themselves to be deluded into believing that Hispanics are a &ldquo;white&rdquo; group and therefore a natural political asset. In reality, probably only about 25% or less of Hispanics living in the USA, can be seen as actual European whites and the rest are mestizo or mulatto hybrids. They vote like a grasping Third World population, because that is what they are genetically, regardless of<br>
pantomimed &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; religious and social values. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p><br>
And how many of those Mexicans are skilled at ANYTHING? Almost none. Everybody knows that. If US imported immigrants according to skill, we&rsquo;d be bringing in a bunch of Asians, a few Hindus, and virtually ZERO mestizos, blacks, or other Third Worlders. </p>
<p>If Berdoo has only 18% latino, they should count themselves lucky. In nearby LA it&rsquo;s over 50%   &mdash;   which means it&rsquo;s Game Over for Anglos. </p>
<p>Overall, this is neither the dumbest nor the most offensive MSM article I&rsquo;ve ever read about immigration   &mdash;   yet because of the PC stranglehold, it still falls well short of what you&rsquo;d call &#8220;hard-hitting reporting&#8221; on the subject.</p>

		<p>American political elections are so fraudulent that if no one cast a single vote the media would invent the results.  </p>
<p>The grand illusion is to make the public believe that election results represent the will of the people.  </p>
