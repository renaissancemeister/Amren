			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Grace West, WNBC-TV (New York), April 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of officials and influential leaders are participating in an annual national convention hosted by Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network, which began Wednesday morning. </p>
<p>The four-day conference will feature prominent names in politics, civil rights, religion, business, education and entertainment addressing issues that impact people of color with a priority on racial inequality. Topics include health care, the racial achievement gap, labor and employment, the state of the Black Church, and others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The major highlight of the convention is a leadership forum on the concluding day, &#8220;Measuring the Movement: Black Leadership&rsquo;s 12-Month Action Plan,&#8221; where leaders representing constituencies across the county will pledge a plan of action to affect change regarding these issues over a 12-month period. This event will air live on TV One, and a special hosted by Joe Scarborough will air on MSNBC.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The convention, held from April 14-17 at the Sheraton New York Hotel &amp; Towers, is free and open to the public, though pre-registration is required. For more information and a complete schedule of events, visit the National Action Network. </p>

<p>&#8220;The four-day conference will feature prominent names in politics, White leadership, religion, business, education and entertainment addressing issues that impact White people with a priority on racial inequality. Topics include health care, the racial affirmative-action gap, labor and employment, the state of the White Church, and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major highlight of the convention is a leadership forum on the concluding day, &ldquo;Measuring the Movement: White Leadership&rsquo;s 12-Month Action Plan,&rdquo; where leaders representing majority-White constituencies across the county will pledge a plan of action to affect [sic] change regarding these issues over a 12-month period. This event will air live on TV One, and a special will air on White Entertainment Television.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, indeed Al, old boy, inequality is a problem between blacks and whites&hellip;but it&rsquo;s a problem as well between blacks and Hispanics, blacks and Asians, and blacks and all other races, and the inequality has to do with lower intelligence and ability within the black community as a whole.  </p>
<p>Claiming slavery or oppression or racism is the reason blacks fail is believable only to mentally challenged diversity fools or low intellect blacks.  Everybody else knows better.  It&rsquo;s quite obvious not only in this country, but throughout the world.  Black failure is a world-wide problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really as simple as that.</p>

		<p>How can someone get it wrong as often as Sharpton has, and still retain credibility&hellip; or even self-confidence for that matter? This is the champion of Crystal Mangum, Tawana Brawley, and those thugs marauding through the football bleachers punching out (white) people a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about Sharpton that makes me feel that, at heart, he&rsquo;s a well-intentioned person. But he&rsquo;s not very bright, and those who follow him are even less so. He&rsquo;s the Nancy Grace of race, constantly jumping to self-righteously indignant conclusions without the benefit of facts.</p>

		<p>Wow, ol&rsquo; Al must need some money and some attention - he&rsquo;s been out of the headlines for awhile now.  He&rsquo;s made his career out of convincing blacks that they&rsquo;re victims, and he isn&rsquo;t about to stop that garbage now.  Just watch - he&rsquo;ll get paid a LOT for this, and eventually some story will come out about how he raided the treasury on this&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I pulled up the link QD provided and found this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;According to the official program, the &#8216;Republican National Convention&rsquo; [they meant Committee, not Convention&rsquo;] is among the 45 sponsors of the event that serves as Sharpton&rsquo;s biggest fundraising event of the year&hellip; According to NAN, sponsorship requires a contribution of $5,000 to $100,000.</p>
<p>Steele is speaking at the event this afternoon, an appearance we asked him to cancel. Yesterday, RNC Coalitions Director Angela Sailor insisted to me that Steele&rsquo;s purpose in participating was to reach the 500-1,000 attendees with the GOP message&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not believe the last line.  I believe Steele is speaking because he agrees with $harpton&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p>So anyone who contributed to the Stupid  &mdash;  I mean Republican party  &mdash;  how do you feel about your contribution being used to support White-hating $harpton?</p>
<p>Sort of vindicates those of us who have received harsh criticism for repeating Gov. Wallace&rsquo; proclamation: </p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&rsquo;t a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between the two parties!&#8221;</p>
<p>Who has done more damage to this country and to Whites, Nixon, Clinton or Bush I and II?  Let&rsquo;s see, flooding the economy with fiat dollars triggering hyper-inflation?  Expanding  ridiculously expensive overseas wars against Third World nations that are no threat to us?  Socializing health care which will drive punitive taxes even higher?  Threatening war with Iran? Supporting and expanding anti-White laws and policies?</p>
<p>All three, but I&rsquo;d go with obama.</p>

		<p>I hope he will address the REAL issues that account for blacks&rsquo; failure in our society: drugs, crime, unwed children, male incarceration, lack of cohesive family, lack of discipline in school-age children, violence, lack of accountability for anti-social behavior, illiteracy, gang affiliation, victimization psychology, etc., etc. But my guess is Sharpton will blame it all, as he always does, on whitey and the system&hellip;.</p>

<p>Sorry, I meant four  &mdash;  I added Nixon at the last minute  &mdash;  because he, as a Republican president, imposed anti-White Affirmative Action:</p>
<p>&#8216;&hellip;President Richard Nixon, a Republican, became the first president to impose affirmative action when his Department of Labor imposed the Philadelphia Plan upon that city&rsquo;s construction industry in 1969. The Plan was soon followed by affirmative action rules (Order No. 4) for all federal government agencies and contractors, setting in motion profound changes in the American workplace.</p>
<p>The Nixon administration established racial quotas in hiring, promotion, college admissions, and government contracting&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Diversity and skin color trump equal justice and it&rsquo;s been that way ever since. </p>

<p>Because America is a racist nation, but in a different way from how Al Sharpton imagines it to be. I want you to think of a hypothetical good black kid who attended school with Sharpton 40 years ago. Such a kid probably thought that the way to get ahead in America is to follow the rules, study hard, obey the law, be honest, be polite and respectful to others, work hard, avoid thug culture, and you would end up a success. By observing such good old-fashioned American values, you would become famous, successful, powerful, and be highly respected in society. You may even get a chance to meet with the President, corporate executives, celebrities, and other important people. After all, that is how the baseball great, Jackie Robinson, a true gentleman and a black Republican, became successful in the 1950s.</p>
<p>But it is not the hypothetical hard-working black kid who is getting the White House invitations. He is not getting a chance to meet Senators, Congressmen, celebrities, corporate executives, and other people. Can you all imagine how such a hypothetical honest classmate of Sharpton feels today, when he sees Sharpton getting all the wealth, fame, power, media attention, and White House invitations? If you were a black kid attending school today, what would you think? Sharpton has shown that, in order to get ahead in America as a black man, you need to be a liar, a thug, an inciter to violence, lazy, irresponsible, demagogic, corrupt, unscrupulous, and an all-round dirtbag. Blacks who play by the rules are dummies.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t an example of American racism, what is?  </p>

		<p>Will Rev. Sharpton discuss &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; by Herrenstein and Murray? It provides overwhelming evidence that races are NOT equal. So, in any free multi-racial society there must be racial inequality. Only by means of oppression, draconnian laws, and forced redistribution of fruits of work can races be made equal.<br>
