			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Brown, Wall Street Journal, April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the folks in the White House begin looking toward President Barack Obama&rsquo;s presumed re-election campaign in 2012, there is one statistic that might worry them more than any other: Little more than a third of white voters currently think the president is doing a good job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s job approval rating remains in the mid-to-high-40s overall only because he gets a thumbs up from more than 90% of blacks and gets majority support from Hispanics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A Potentially Big Problem</b></p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s weakness among whites, who comprise almost three quarters of the electorate even as the nation&rsquo;s population becomes more racially diverse, is a potentially sizable political problem for the nation&rsquo;s first African-American president.</p>
<p>The White House clearly recognizes that. Mr. Obama, trying to shore up support for Democratic candidates this year, is reaching out to both minorities and some selected groups of white voters, especially young people. {snip}</p>
<p>The easy explanation for Mr. Obama&rsquo;s declining approval among whites, and one some will certainly adopt, is that these numbers reflect racism on the part of white voters. That may be the case for some, but White House political strategists would be sticking their heads in the sand to see it that way.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Obama&rsquo;s weakness among whites tracks other Democratic presidents and wannabes, all of whom were white. No Democratic presidential nominee has won a majority of the white vote since Lyndon Johnson in 1964  &mdash;  even Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, who won the White House anyway.</p>
<p><b>Factoring in the Economy</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clearly, one of the reasons for the drop in President Obama&rsquo;s poll numbers is the lousy economy, which he inherited from his predecessor. A better economy will help the president among all races.</p>
<p>But the wide difference in job approval between whites and blacks almost certainly stems from the fact that Democrats have historically been the political party of government. Their candidates tend to embrace governmental solutions to problems while Republicans are much more likely to see the private sector as the solver of societal ills.</p>
<p>As a candidate, Mr. Obama benefited from perhaps the most influential event to occur in the final 45 days of a presidential campaign in modern times  &mdash;  the Wall Street meltdown. Republican John McCain narrowly led many polls in early September just before the financial collapse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Reversing Opinion</b></p>
<p>But many of these same voters have now reversed their opinion about the president. Last week&rsquo;s Quinnipiac poll found only 35% of whites gave the president a positive job approval. Public opinion polls generally don&rsquo;t ask why voters approve or disapprove of a president.</p>
<p>The gap between black and white support for the president, however, comes from more than just African-Americans&rsquo; pride in one of their own.</p>
<p>As a group, black voters are much more in tune with the notion of a larger government role for an understandable reason: the public sector was the instrument of civil-rights laws and economic-opportunity programs much earlier than private industry. During the health-care overhaul debate, for instance, polls found African-Americans favored the proposal while whites opposed it.</p>
<p>Health care has been just one area, albeit a major one, in which this president and his policies have moved toward a larger government role in American life.</p>

		<p>They must have become racist during the last year. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I know the comment that came with this article was meant to be tongue in cheek.  However, I would like people to consider the implications that it might very well be true.  As in a rather large number of whites have woken up to the race issue.</p>
<p>Electing Obama was the ultimate denial.  And it failed spectacularly.  This leaves the well meaning anti-racist in a difficult position, emotionally.  He has figured out that something is wrong.  Most know exactly what that something is&hellip;.they&rsquo;ve seen evidence of it first hand.  Many have now become victims of it.  But they still see those around them, as having the same beliefs as before.  They think they are an aberration in a sea of political correctness.</p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t stand for very long.  This country did the very worst thing it could possibly do to anti-racist liberals&hellip;..give them what they want.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>

<p>Yes that is &#8220;one&#8221; of the reasons.  But, of course, the biggest reason is the fact the man is the opposite of what he ran on.  He&rsquo;s an anti-white racist, he&rsquo;s not transparent, he&rsquo;s got the most crooked administration&hellip;and Congress&hellip;in history, and he&rsquo;s pro-black, racially divisive, advancing only those things he perceives are helpful to blacks.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also incompetent and thinks the Marine Corps is pronounced &#8220;Marine Corpse,&#8221; plus other inanities that a high schooler wouldn&rsquo;t be guilty of.  He&rsquo;s bankrupting the country with overspending, and he&rsquo;s turning us into a socialist state in order to help his black brothers who can&rsquo;t succeed without giveaways from the government.</p>
<p>Besides those very minor things, he&rsquo;s just simply great.</p>

		<p>This poll seems to be a general public opinion poll, not a poll of likely voters. That&rsquo;s understandable, since polls of likely voters, because they require more questions and more analysis to weed out the unlikely voters, are usually done only by campaign committees or, by other polling entities, nearer to an election.<br>
   Since middle class suburban voters are far more likely to actually go out and vote than inner-city voters, and since most middle class suburban voters are white, this poll is bad news for Obama in 2012. But, since there is less general interest in off-year elections, yet the suburban white voters still show up to vote in good numbers, this is EXTREMELY bad news for the party which Obama leads.<br>
   I can&rsquo;t wait &#8216;til November - and January, when the next Congress is sworn in.</p>

		<p>I am not convinced by this article or the poll. Everyone knows that historically the party out of power loses seats. However, there is such widespread disgust with both politcal parties that I would not be surprised if many Americans, especially independents stay home this November.</p>
<p>Also the Wall street Journal is polling individuals who did not vote for Obama in 2008 nor will do so this fall. There will probably be enough lunatic liberals and collee students who will get out the vote to help Barry Whacko Obama to offset any significant loss of house seats. Even Michael Steele GOP chairman said that te GOP will probably not take back the senate or house this fall.  </p>

		<p>When for perfectly valid reasons Whites oppose Obama&rsquo;s policies and actions they are called racists.  When blacks give him a 90% approval rating because he is of the same race, that&rsquo;s never called racism.  The hypocrisy of the press is amazing.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s plan to solve his &#8220;white problem&#8221; is to make it irrelevant.  Give amnesty to 20 million illegal aliens, the vast majority of them non-white, and then they will join with the non-whites who are already citizens to reelect Obama.  The primary goal of the left is to make whites a minority.  There is no other explanation for why the left is so adamantly in favor of illegal immigration.  It can&rsquo;t be because they are concerned about the increasing economic inequality in this country, and the stagnant and declining wages of the working class.  After all, illegal immigrants are used by our corporate masters to keep wages low.  It can&rsquo;t be because the left wants to protect the environment.  Overpopulation will ultimately nullify all attempts to protect open space and endangered species.  If there&rsquo;s any leftist lurking who dares to post here, please explain why you favor illegal immigration if it&rsquo;s not because you want to make whites a minority.</p>

<p>Keep printing &ldquo;money&rdquo; Comrade Obama and see where the &ldquo;economy&rdquo; goes then.</p>
<p>It will be floating next to you, and a steaming and stinking chunk of Mohammad, in history&rsquo;s giant toilet!</p>
<p>Comrade Obama could give a care less what happens to &ldquo;our economy.&rdquo; He has a massive Marxist social agenda that he intends to enact, even if we all starve to death (regardless of race) in the process. That is what his kind do, be it in Russia or Zimbabwe; they promise &ldquo;everything,&rdquo; and yield only misery and pestilence. This year, the Neo-Comrades will likely take the US House and US Senate because of this Red ineptitude of his. </p>
<p>I ask a simple question here, so what?</p>
<p>He and they will come to a &ldquo;bipartisan&rdquo; agreement, that we are all too &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; to understand their true intentions toward progress. And so on, and so on, and so on,&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>With the exception of the marxist strongholds in the United States, Obama&rsquo;s support among whites has always been tepid at best.  He managed to garner a little over 40% of the white vote in 2008 due largely to the naiveté of many young whites and the complete ineptitude of George W. Bush.  I predict less than 20% of whites will vote for Barack Hussein Obama in 2012, and he may very well reach single digits in the rural midwest and south.   </p>

		<p>If our Kenyan president voodoo-obama turns more Whites into racists, then he&rsquo;ll be an icon in the history of our struggle for White Civil Rights.  They problem with this country is that too few of us are non-racists.   Racists will solve the problems of this country faster than anybody, and without racists, this country is ka-put.</p>
<p>I admire Lincoln ONLY  because he had correct opinions about blacks.   Racist yankees were smarter about race than antebellum Southern plantation owners.  Who would want to surround their White  with a tribe of afrovoodoos out in the middle of nowhere?</p>
<p>The South was very mistaken about its chances for survival.  The fate of nature still awaits its final reckoning.   </p>

		<p>Many whites were conned in one of the slickest campaigns in American political history.  Other factors were the opposition party that did not really desire to win, and the mainstream news media displaying a bias that has sullied its reputation forever in the eyes of many Americans.</p>
<p>Flash-forward 2010; the post-racial propaganda was shown to be a fraud, economic indicators are negative, and the mainstream news media is dying.  Many whites who were conned are now livid and are throwing off the shackles of &#8220;white guilt&#8221; and are organizing in the &#8220;Tea Parties&#8221;.  They will vote Obama out in 2012. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The first African-American president.&#8221;<br>
*<br>
Obama will not be re-elected to a second term, and in the process he has ensured that it will be a long, long time before there is a second African-American president, no matter how competant and patriotic he (or she) may be. Americans will spend trillions of dollars over umpteen years fixing the damage he has inflicted on this nation, and whenever faced with a choice of an African-American cadidate, voters are going to say, &#8220;Oh no, been there, done that, and NEVER again.&#8221; This reaction, even in the most anti-racially aware voter will be visceral. Possibly unadmitted, but there, never-the-less. </p>

		<p>All you gotta do is look at the numbers in your 401K or your stock holdings, count up how much money you&rsquo;ve lost due to the lousy economy, then notice that B.O. has done NOTHING to improve said economy - and whenever your money is messed over, you&rsquo;re going to bite back.  How tough is that to get???  I don&rsquo;t think whites are looking at B.O.&rsquo;s blackness - we&rsquo;re looking at the dwindling GREENNESS in our own private stashes and saying, &#8220;Enough already; get somebody in there who knows what he&rsquo;s doing with MONEY!!!&#8221;  </p>

		<p><i>The plain fact is that the Obama Administration has very shallow roots in historic America. It is, to put it brutally, a minority occupation government. Government and governed have little real contact or mutual understanding. It&rsquo;s a recipe for continuous clashes.</i> - Peter Brimelow</p>
<p>True, but the O administration is just the precursor to real minority/Leftist control, they haven&rsquo;t quite yet imported the numbers necessary for the real third-worlding of American political power.   One of the most amazing spectacles of the O years is just how blatant and open the white-hating racism of the Democratic coalition has become.   It amounts to the virtual criminalization of whiteness.   The Democrats sense a mostly subconscious, gut-level reaction to the hate they&rsquo;ve been spewing on whites since before Obama was elected,  and lately they&rsquo;ve been backing off a bit on venting their true feelings toward whites.   It&rsquo;s gone out as a talking point, apparently.  For at least one or two more election cycles their going to bave to pretend not to loathe whites.    Fortunately for them,  none of their &#8220;opponents&#8221; dares to make an explicit issue out of their blatant racism.  </p>

		<p>Well, who cares what this PC robot pens about the holy grail of journalista subjects (white racism). The athor is a chimp, and I neither know, or care, what color he is.<br>
The point he raises about which I do care, is the increasingly obvious: <br>
&#8220;&hellip;whites, who comprise almost three quarters of the electorate even as the nation&rsquo;s population becomes more racially diverse, is a potentially sizable political problem for the nation&rsquo;s first African-American president.&#8221;</p>
<p> ( I don&rsquo;t give a hoot about Obama&rsquo;s skin color&hellip;he&rsquo;s half-white, which the racist media never mentions&hellip;but),Yes, INDEED. Even though most whites are efete and brainwashed, increasingly, we will be like angry wolves, who will tear the hands off of anyone who comes near us. Whites will soon become (en masse) quite averse, allergic, hostile, and  in some cases, violent, to the PC police, any hostile third world invaders, and the establishment. Yes, oh horror of horrors (LOL), &#8220;homegrown terrorism&hellip;&#8221; Gasp! Forget the government propoganda. Historical AMERICANS are sick of being abused, killed, used and raped. <br>
As marxists (or just plain self-serving pukes like this &#8220;journalist&#8221;) get their way, and finally break the demographics of the USA down into racial enclaves, they&rsquo;ll reap a whirlwind: browns and blacks raping and killing like hell on earth, and tough, organized, armed-to-the -teeth whites, off minding their own business, and pouncing like mad wolves at anybody who enters their domains.<br>
Paradise, huh? Is this what Marxists want? It&rsquo;s all they ever create&hellip;hell on earth!<br>
Well, marxists, you worked for fifty years to make it happen. Against all decency, against all sanity, you labored in your hatred of your own. Enjoy it while you can. You won&rsquo;t have much time before the brown third world hordes engulf and devour you in a horrible melee. You are weak and defenseless. Only whites can defend you&hellip;but none will save you. we will be living in our new homes, forever having turned our backs on you. </p>

or what they are-blacks will never, never, ever stop playing the race card in this country. Gates is nothing but a race hustler who benfited from policies in this country and so is Obama.  And, notter what level of education they have, everything in this country, whether standard operating procedures, or standards of conduct, are &#8220;racist.&#8221;   FRankly, I&rsquo;m delighted that finally more white people are waking up to racial realities.</p>

		<p> There is an much bigger problem for Mr. Soetoro (AKA Mr. Obama), he&rsquo;s spent millions of dollars fighting every effort to disclose his paper trail since birth. If the new Arizona Safe Communities Law bothers the left wing nuts, wait until the hardly mentioned Arizona Eligibility Law comes into play next year - the Az. Secretary of State is now required to verify every candidates eligibility in order to be put on the ballot.<br>
 Say what ever you want about so called birthers, but the more I&rsquo;ve looked into this the more it stinks to high heaven. There is certainly some level of cover-up with his past, and as in the story of the emperors new clothes, the public are beginning to wonder whats really going on.<br>
 What happens when a State in the Union disqualifies a sitting president to run for re-election? I predict a Constitutional crisis proportional to the level of deceit - the bigger the lies we&rsquo;ve been told, the bigger the turmoil the correct them.</p>

		<p>As Orwell pointed out in &#8220;1984&#8221; countries are controlled by large organizations and this fact, if known, would make the average citizen feel impotent and small in comparison.  </p>
<p>Ergo, the ruling elite pick a figurehead president, emperor, king, etc. to serve as a focal point for the average citizen&rsquo;s love or hatred of government.  </p>
<p>This brings it down to an illusionary one to one ratio between the average citizen and the government.  </p>
<p>In America the majority tend to parrot &#8220;the president did this, the president did that&#8221; when it is the congress that governs and not the president.  </p>
<p>Obama is nothing more than a sock puppet of the Clintons, the congress, the Muslims and the global communists.  </p>
<p>He is still a traitor, but he is not the only traitor we will bring to justice&hellip;     </p>

		<p>There are a lot of brain-dead Whites around these days, I see them in the schools all the time  &mdash;   robot-like automatons &#8216;marching in lock-step&rsquo; spouting off about &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo;, impervious to queries asking what &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; have accomplished.  &mdash;  as they hand their wealth, jobs and children&rsquo;s futures over to racist non-Whites.</p>
<p>Obama is a White-hating racist, this is not in dispute.</p>
<p>There are so many examples:</p>
<p>AG holder:  &#8220;&hellip;before the Senate Judiciary Committee he asserted that the hate bill does not protect Christian ministers, Whites, heterosexuals, policemen and members of U.S. military. Only favored groups, he said, such as homosexuals, blacks, Latinos, Jews, Muslims, and women will benefit under this new law&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And from DOJ:   &#8220;&hellip;The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has given U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder an April 12 deadline to state whether the Justice Department will stop stonewalling an investigation of alleged [White] voter intimidation involving three members of the New Black Panther Party for Self Defense in Philadelphia&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And on the sane new law in Arizona:  &#8220;&hellip;Obama&hellip; has &#8216;instructed members of [his] administration to closely monitor the situation and examine the civil rights and other implications of this legislation.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Do these things seem anti-White to you?  Is it not the job of the US government to protect its citizens from foreign colonization? Enforce the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment? Administer justice fairly and for all without regard to &#8216;color, creed or religion?&rsquo;  To all, not just those ethic/racial groups the government selects.</p>
<p>Is the current government protecting or violating the Rights Of White American Citizens?</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not enough there&rsquo;s the SCOTUS appointment of another anti-White racist, sotomeyer:</p>
<p>As a member of the National Council of La Raza, Ms. Sotomayor said: &#8216;I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion as a judge than a white male who hasn&rsquo;t lived that life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And on fairness and equality to Whites:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Sotomayor voted (without writing an opinion) to join two colleagues in upholding  racial discrimination by New Haven, Conn. The city denied promotions to White firefighters who did best on a test of job-related skills because none was black&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If this administration gets away with this, and the obama regime is elected to another four-year term,  there will be more anti-White enforcement, A LOT of it. </p>
<p>Educate any Whites, friend or family that you can as to what is at stake.  I know it is hard to get around the mindless brainwashing of the young but this may be our last chance to to stop the complete communization of our culture. </p>
<p>Kevin MacDonald recently wrote the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger. From the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution to contemporary Africa, the lesson is the same: Loss of political power means murder and mayhem directed against Whites by minorities with deep historical grudges&hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>Yes, but given that &#8220;the first African-American president&#8221; simply <i>cannot</i> be permitted to fail, Barack Hussein Obama&rsquo;s numbers will somehow rise as the next election approaches. All the forces that run the country will see to it that he is reelected. </p>

		<p>The fallout from him not being reelcted will be far worse than him not having been elected in the first place. All of the White Lib&rsquo;s and Guilty White&rsquo;s will come flocking back to him and he will be reelcted in 2012. All of this nonsense is nothing but wishful thinking on the part of so called conservative&rsquo;s. I only hope I am wrong.</p>

		<p>As painful as it may be for Whites in the short term having Obama as president, the alternative was John McCain.  And having McCain as president just wouldn&rsquo;t have provided the awakening desperately needed within the White community that Obama has brought. When it comes to many issues of importance to White Americans, McCain fails miserably (as does Obama).</p>
<p>Looking at the big picture, having a &#8220;President Obama&#8221; was quite possibly a blessing in disguise for White Americans. It finally woke many Whites from their slumber, thinking that Democrats were race-neutral in their policies. And hopefully it has awakened the GOP as well, making them realize that we are serious in our demands for true Conservative candidates rather than minority-pandering Neo-cons and RINO&rsquo;s. </p>
