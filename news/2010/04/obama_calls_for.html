<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama urged Congress on Friday to overhaul the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws, saying that inaction would lead to &#8220;misguided efforts&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsibility by others.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president also said an immigration bill currently on the Arizona governor&rsquo;s desk was &#8220;misguided,&#8221; and said he has ordered his staff to &#8220;closely monitor the situation&#8221; to make sure the measure will not violate people&rsquo;s civil liberties. The bill, already passed by the state House and Senate, would require authorities in Arizona to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s remarks came in a Rose Garden naturalization ceremony for 24 foreign-born members of the U.S. military. The immigrants earned citizenship through their active-duty service.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid is also pushing for action on immigration on Capitol Hill. Reid this week vaulted the issue to the top of Congress&rsquo;s spring agenda, saying at a leadership meeting that the Senate could take up the immigration legislation before it considers an energy bill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The developments underscore election-year realities and appear to reflect in part a political calculation by some Democrats: even if an immigration bill fails, a debate on it could rally their base and mobilize Hispanic voters against GOP lawmakers in some districts. At the same time, the Arizona legislation has provided Democrats the opportunity to put Republicans on the defensive.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, key Democratic supporters including Latino groups, labor unions and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have stepped up pressure on Reid and Obama to tackle the immigration question, as Obama pledged to do in the 2008 presidential race and as Reid has committed to supporters in his Hispanic-heavy home state, where he faces an uphill reelection battle.</p>
<p>As pressure on Democrats has increased, Graham has cooled his support for the proposed bi-partisan framework, which that would strengthen border enforcement, crack down on employers who exploit illegal workers and establish a path for legalization or expulsion of roughly 12 million illegal immigrants. Instead, Graham has made clear in interviews that his priority is an energy and climate bill. He also has blasted the White House for failing to lay groundwork for a Schumer-Graham immigration package.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has joined the fray, calling Republican Sens. Scott Brown (Mass.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), George LeMieux (Fla.), Richard G. Lugar (Ind.) and Judd Gregg (N.H.) on Tuesday to solicit their support, his spokesman said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White House officials said Obama had not reached out to Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R), who is up for reelection, about whether she will sign the bill. Instead, he has asked the Justice Department to keep track of what happens with the bill and how it is enforced if it is enacted.</p>
<p>The White House counsel&rsquo;s office and the Justice Department are examining the Arizona legislation to see if it is constitutional and could lead to any sort of racial profiling, federal law enforcement officials said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee] added, &#8220;One has to ask: are members raising the idea of comprehensive reform now because they believe the majority of Americans truly want it, or because it serves a specific political purpose in a tough election year?&#8221;<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/36216.html">House May Take Up Immigration</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Kasie Hunt, Politico, April 22, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Congressional leaders are ramping up a push for comprehensive immigration reform, potentially exposing deep fissures in the party and forcing nervous lawmakers to vote on an emotional wedge issue just months before the midterm elections.</p>
<p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed publicly on Thursday what has been discussed privately around the Capitol for days  &mdash;  that the House will take up an immigration bill, but only if the Senate passes one first.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whether an immigration bill could get through the Senate is a huge &#8220;if&#8221; of course, just six months from the mid-term elections.</p>
<p>But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is sending his &#8220;strongest signal yet&#8221; that immigration reform is next on tap for the Senate, possibly at the expense of a climate change bill, a Democratic aide said. &#8220;Immigration is gaining steam; climate change may suffer,&#8221; the aide said.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans said the economic climate dooms any potential push for an immigration bill. &#8220;There is little enthusiasm in Congress to pass legislation that would legalize millions of unlawful residents to compete with out-of-work Americans for needed jobs, further driving down pay and draining government resources,&#8221; said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, where the legislation would be sent.</p>
<p>An politically vulnerable House members aren&rsquo;t looking forward to taking yet another difficult vote this year, especially after many have already put their jobs on the line voting with the speaker on healthcare and a cap and trade bill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration is also likely to split the party along both ideological and geographic lines. &#8220;It would show fissures,&#8221; Rep. Jason Altmire (D-Pa.) said.</p>
<p>For Altmire, voting &#8220;no&#8221; on comprehensive immigration reform is a no-brainer. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a tough vote for me at all. I&rsquo;m not going to vote for amnesty,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That pits him against the Congressional Hispanic Caucus  &mdash;  and against other vulnerable Democrats in districts with significant Hispanic populations, like Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a situation Republicans hope to exploit. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But a tough anti-immigrant law in Arizona has brought immigration back into the national conversation. The proposal would require police to stop anyone they had &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; to believe was an illegal immigrant and arrest them if they weren&rsquo;t carrying proper identification.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino leaders are using the Arizona law to draw attention to the issue and they are working hard to convince Democrats that they could face electoral consequences if they don&rsquo;t act on comprehensive immigration reform. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) has said that urging Latino voters to stay home is an option that is on the table.</p>

		<p>President Obama is a naive fool.  It is about time that one of the tough choices that needs to be made to save this country, was made.  Congratulations to the legislature of Arizona.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a long way to go, but it is a start.  The federal government has totally let us down on border security and illegal immigration, and it is a shame that it has come down to the states having to do the job that the feds should be doing.</p>
<p>I hope other states adopt this type of legislation as well.  No one in the federal government has a legitimate complaint.  The feds have had plenty of opportunity to do something -year after year after year - and things have simply got so bad that the states are left with little choice but to adopt this type of legislation.</p>
<p>If the feds had their way, we legal Americans would simply continue to be sitting ducks in this country, as we work hard (but get the heck taxed out of us) to keep this welfare state going.  Meanwhile many of the people on welfare continue to have children that they cannot afford.  When is this insanity going to stop?</p>
<p>P.S. I am also in favor of a long term immigration moratorium, but that is an issue to talk about in another post.</p>

<p>Nonsense!  </p>
<p>The Democrats will never recover from policies and practices of the Obama administration.  </p>
<p>But as long as they insist on speculating, why doesn&rsquo;t the mainfringe media highlight various scenarios of another bone-breaking economic dip, because it is surely coming.</p>
<p>People are not going to have a very high regard for this community organizer&rsquo;s political party when food costs are sky-rocketing, jobs are scarce, gas is up, and inflation is reducing their purchasing power drastically.</p>
<p>Too, there&rsquo;s a good chance civil disobedience might be at the fore as we get a little further into the year, especially if people begin to feel these tax increases, plus the promise of a value added tax.</p>

		<p>This is the person millions of stupid people elected. Someone that is worried about the fate of foreign nationals, illegally in this nation, that neither Obama, or anyone else knows anything about. There could be thousands of hard criminals running around, child molesters, home invasion thieves and robbers,etc. and yet this doesn&rsquo;t concern him or the democrats and Rino&rsquo;s in the least. Over and over and over, these people, whenever a critical moment arises, prove they do not have Americans best interests at heart. Rather, they have another agenda. </p>

		<p>Obama is our Commander and Chief.  He is the person in charge of securing our borders.  To hear this fake, call those of us who are demanding he do his Constitutional job to protect our country from foreign invasion.  Obama is &#8220;guided&#8221; by his racial identity politics which are telling him that if he does what he swore to do, he will lose a key voting block from the coalition that got him elected.  The only thing misguided is our President.    </p>

<p>Of course, Reid and Obama are in an absolute panic. They need to get this thing crackin&rsquo;, but I think it&rsquo;s to late for Reid. Hopefully he&rsquo;s out soon, but Obama knows he needs to legalize illegals before the next election if he hopes to get another term.</p>

		<p> The Federal Government has failed miserably for decades to fix the illegal alien problem in the United States. Believe it or not, vigilantism is allowed under the articles of the bill of rights.<br>
 Under the rights of the eighth amendment, the citizens can take the law into their own hands when the appropriate authorities refuse to do so. The states can enforce their laws when the Federal Government refuses to obey it&rsquo;s own laws.<br>
  I applaud the actions of Arizona lawmakers and pray they have the courage to enforce this law with great vigor. It will make a better, safer and more prosperous state for all residents in that great state.</p>

		<p>The new Arizona law is forcing BHO&rsquo;s hand, that&rsquo;s all.  They&rsquo;d rather lay low and let the demographics slowly roll over us, but now they&rsquo;re afraid that the states might really begin to defy D.C.  What can the Feds say?  &#8220;Leave it to us, we&rsquo;ll take care of it&#8221;?   <br>
     I have long dreamed of getting a leftist to answer a straight question.  They can&rsquo;t, without incriminating themselves as fools or traitors.  That&rsquo;s why colleges have speech codes, why states have &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws, and why Bill Clinton is blathering about &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; speech.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m obviously not a constitutional scholar like our Dear Leader claims to be, but it seems to me that federal law supersedes state law  &mdash;  when federal law is enforced, that is.  Legally, I doubt Obama and the feds can do anything unless they decide to enforce existing federal immigration laws, thus preventing Arizona from doing the same.  It won&rsquo;t happen, so look to the DOJ to start investigating local police departments and filing lawsuits for &#8220;harassment&#8221; of &#8220;citizens.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What Arizona did is well within it&rsquo;s rights.  If Obama and Holder try to come down on Arizona using arrogant federal might, Arizona should refuse to be interfered with, thereby beginning the Constitutional crisis the leftists forced us in to.  Moreover, if the Feds try to stifle Arizona&rsquo;s RIGHT to protect it&rsquo;s own citizens and economy, all the rest of the States should immediately pass an identical bill in solidarity, thereby defying the Feds and putting them on notice - even if they have to call a special legislative session to do so.  </p>

<p>Whether they knew it or not, the AZ legislature and the Governor has backed Obama into a Catch 22.  Midterm elections are largely the province of middle aged and older whites, the younger whites plus blacks and Hispanics tend only to vote in Presidentials.  I get the feeling that in areas where there is a lot of black-Hispanic competition, if Obama comes out against this bill too much, it might induce some halfway intelligent black voters not to vote in the midterms.  </p>
<p>13 and others:</p>
<p>Immigration is a Federal object, in that the Federal government gets to decide who can and cannot immigrate here.  All AZ is doing is enforcing the Federal government&rsquo;s duly enacted immigration law.  Just like AZ&rsquo;s state highway patrol, local city police officers and local sheriff&rsquo;s deputies apprehend bank robbers and those accused of espionage.  Now, of course, after AZ passed this bill, the Democrats in D.C. are now getting on their high horse ASAP to open the borders, to make AZ&rsquo;s law moot.  But again, Catch 22 time for them.</p>
<p>Just as a humorous aside, Arizona&rsquo;s current Governor, Jan Brewer, succeeded Janet Napolitano after Obama appointed her to HLS.  (Reason for that, IMHO, is that getting her out of AZ was his reward to McCain for not running a strenuous campaign against him for President; it was thought at the time that Napol. was McCain&rsquo;s only real hurdle to another Senate term).  And Napol. followed one Jane Hull as Gov.  So you&rsquo;ve had three women Governors in a row, Jane, Janet and Jan.  I like this &#8220;Jan&#8221; the best, from what I have seen.</p>

<p>This is a push by Hispanics to bring in more illegals so we can have another amnesty in a few years.  It also brings in more legal residents, mostly from Mexico. </p>

		<p>The left is already in the process of going to Court.  They&rsquo;ll probably have the Chamber of Commerce with them. Their pitch will be that the feds have enacted a comprehensive scheme of regulating immigration such that the states have very limited latitude in which to make any changes, in short federal preemption.  However I think this can certainly be attacked in that the regulatory scheme can hardly be considered comprehensive when it is totally ineffectual. In effect it is not a scheme of regulation at all.  This allows the states to argue two things.  First states should argue that although Congress has taken exclusive control over immigration, the issue today is illegal immigration and Congress does not have a complete scheme for dealing with illegal immigration and thus does not have exclusive control in this area.  It seems to me very difficult to argue you have a comprehensive scheme of the type the SCOTUS requires for preemption when the scheme you have to deal with illegal immigration has failed so abjectly. Second even if they can somehow show they have a complete scheme of regulating illegal immigration they have failed in doing so to such an extent that they can hardly claim the state is interferring with their effective implementation of said scheme,i.e. anything the states do will be an aid not a hindrance. I don&rsquo;t believe the SCOTUS will be impressed with a Congressional preemption argument when it reviews how Congress has thrown these Southwest states to the wolves for politics and then complains when they try to do the job Congress refuses to do. Even assuming the trespass law passes constitutional muster it will still require reasonable cause to stop some one and ask for ID, so enforcement will require meaningful training as to who and what situations represent reasonable cause.</p>

		<p>The one thing that would shut the community organizer up is if other states passed similar laws, like Georgia and Florida, two states that are over run with illegals also.</p>
<p>These recent governors have a way of pursuing the same aims as if they are reading from the same book of necessities.  The legislatures do the same.  The &#8220;stand your ground laws&#8221; are one example.  Another is the resolution many states passed reiterating their sovereignty.  Another like minded purpose is open carry, which was recently passed by a third state.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping the states continue passing laws on issues Dear Leader is trying to co-opt as federal oversight when they&rsquo;ve never been so before. </p>

<p>I agree that using facts, logic, reason and evidence re states&rsquo; rights should be part of AZ&rsquo;s defense in what will inevitably be a Federal lawsuit.  However, I have found that a good heap of emotion will move mountains.  </p>
<p>Two words:  Robert Krentz.</p>
<p>A few more words:  Every good looking white girl or woman that has been mowed down by a drunk driving illegal Hispanic.</p>
<p>As an aside, V-Dare had an article a few days ago.  Its point was that Obama might not know what he&rsquo;s doing here re immigration, because he and his team misinterpret Bush 43&rsquo;s decline in popularity as public repudiation of the scant few items of conservatism he advocated, when in reality, the most severe drop came while he was pushing &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ah yes! The tyrant king wants to usurp the peasants wishes, whoda thunk it? We, and I use the word we, loosely since so many are so filled with hatred for Bush, can oust these left wing radicals from power with the pen, which in this case IS mightier than the sword. Get your sorry back sides out there, swallow your bitter pill, and vote the far lesser of evil republicans in power. Or as is usual, many will let their misguided principals cause them to throw their vote away, on some pipe dream candidates, who even if elected would be essentially helpless, due to their inferior numbers. Surely this is the chance to use the republicans greed for power to our advantage. Overthrow the marxists with conservative republicans, don&rsquo;t let the msm brainwash your votes, with with their slanted rhetoric. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The developments underscore election-year realities and appear to reflect in part a political calculation by some Democrats: even if an immigration bill fails, a debate on it could rally their base and mobilize Hispanic voters against GOP lawmakers in some districts. At the same time, the Arizona legislation has provided Democrats the opportunity to put Republicans on the defensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, that paragraph really stuck out like a hideously mangled arm in a poorly designed splint, in highlighting just how desperate the multicultural establishment has become. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; issue is one they always lose, no matter how they fantasize otherwise and then spew these perverted and soggy daydreams as a &ldquo;moral&rdquo; issue of &ldquo;humanitarianism.&rdquo;  It just doesn&rsquo;t work; even the traitor El Presidente Bush, learned this when he attempted an amnesty. It blew up in his dully smirking face, since so too did the very &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; invaders he wished to make &ldquo;documented,&rdquo; when they didn&rsquo;t get everything their little &ldquo;broken&rdquo; hearts desired.  Namely, the whole country on a silver platter of refried beans marinated in tequila.</p>
<p>Does anyone really think that the failed General Secretary Obama and his Commissariats, will do any better?</p>
<p>Hardly!</p>
<p>The whole problem with the Marxist elites in this country today, is that they have forgotten that the cultural approach when destroying a country with Communism, requires incrementalism. It cannot be the overzealously dramatized saturation of obvious anti-white genocidal &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; that they now practice, within their multicultural paradigm. That is the &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; approach that failed in the 60s and 70s, that one might call Berkley Bolshevism.  </p>
<p>The &ldquo;two&rdquo; political parties in this country have grown so bloated with the cravenly condescending or the outright arrogantly ignorant, that they make a joke of any issue they trumpet as being &ldquo;needed&rdquo; or &ldquo;ethical,&rdquo; but they also claim as being &ldquo;open to debate.&rdquo; There is no debate, only a cacophony of orchestrated insults and idiocy as being such.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>Another quick point about the worthless Reds who run the USSA, quite unlike their Soviet counterparts in the now defunct USSR, is that the latter always did their best to camouflaged their unearned social advantages and power. Not so with these former &ldquo;two party&rdquo; apparatchiks and commissars in this fading multicultural utopia of ours; quite the contrary, they revel in and flaunt it. </p>
<p>In short, they might just get their &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; but I highly doubt they will like its methods or results.</p>
<p>May God let it be so!</p>

		<p> The framers of the Constitution knew that State and local governments are more responsive to the people&rsquo;s wishes  &mdash;  hence the Tenth Amendment. I can only hope that more states will imitate Arizona and start enforcing the laws that our Federal Government illegally ignores.</p>

		<p>This AZ law is bad news for Utah and beyond. All the illegals have to do is keep moving, which most of them do anyway. This doesn&rsquo;t really solve anything. Makes it worse, in fact.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s another powerful person who has come out against this law.  I&rsquo;m sure this one will have AZ shaking in its shoes:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually a bit jealous now.  Before this, MO had the toughest anti-illegal alien set of state laws in the country.  But alas, we were deprived of Al Sharpton&rsquo;s presence.</p>

		<p>The only &#8220;misguided&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; person happens to be the President. The Governor of AZ., no matter what her motive is, has made a good move. Something this President and several before him have not done. All they can think of is &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; which we all know is code for amnesty. Haven&rsquo;t heard anything about &#8220;immigration enforcement.&#8221; That phrase seems to be missing from his lexicon. So, thank you Gov. Brewer. You have more courage than most of Washington.</p>

		<p>Now would be a great time to remind your state senators and state congressmen of how we feel about AMNESTY! That a vote for amnesty equates to political suicide. That the ONLY immigration reform needed is a secure fence, patrolled by heavily armed military units.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s gotten into Senator Lindsey Graham?  He&rsquo;s a Republican from one the nation&rsquo;s most conservative states, yet he&rsquo;s been carrying the water for the Reconquista types for the last few years.  Is he in the hip pockets of upland textile manufacturers in the Greenville/Spartanburg area who seek low-wage workers?  South Carolina voters should retire him at the earliest possible opportunity. </p>
