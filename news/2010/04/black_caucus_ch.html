			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell Berman, The Hill, April 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just hours after Justice John Paul Stevens handed in his retirement notice, President Barack Obama came under pressure to appoint a second black justice to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>A leading African-American lawmaker is urging Obama to consider women and minority candidates as he selects a replacement for Stevens.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is essential President Obama consider gender and ethnic diversity on the high court in an increasingly diverse America,&#8221; Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement Friday, {snip}.</p>
<p>When Justice David Souter left the court a year ago, CBC members suggested Obama consider one of their own colleagues, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.</p>

		<p>Yes, by all means, let&rsquo;s have another incompetent appointed to another high position.  I mean, why not, this community organizer has them everywhere.  Just look at the lack of qualifications on the ones he&rsquo;s appointed so far, for example, Van Jones, Mark Lloyd, or how about the one in charge of NASA now?  He&rsquo;s about as far away from a scientist as he could get, but he&rsquo;s black and with Obama that&rsquo;s the only thing that is important.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re in the last days of Egypt when any raggedy vagabond or mulatto coming down the road could be in high office.  And, just like them we&rsquo;re headed for break up.</p>

		<p>Good for AR for pointing out the disappearing Anglo-Saxon Protestant on the Supreme Court.  Justice Stevens was the last one of the stock that founded our country and gave it it&rsquo;s institutions, character, prosperity, and greatness.</p>
<p>Note that &#8220;diversity&#8221; as used by Rep. Lee does not include white men.  Note also that under Civil Service rules in our national government white men are not afforded the status of a &#8220;protected group&#8221; as blacks, women, Hispanics, and the handicapped are, and so are defenseless against racial discrimination.  When it&rsquo;s against white males, none dare call it discrimination.</p>
<p>Any group that allows itself to be treated this way, especially by the very government it created, should realize it&rsquo;s in serious trouble.</p>
<p>An Irish-Catholic tabloid writer named Pete Hamill wrote a book about New York City recently and proclaimed that New York was built by blacks, Jews, Irish, and Italians.  HE COMPLETELY OMITTED THE GROUP THAT CREATED MODERN NEW YORK AND THE WHOLE UNITED STATES!  Reminds me of the Irish-Catholic immigant politican who eulogized one of his cronies by saying he was the first to make Boston &#8220;a fit place to live.&#8221;  Rep. Lee is following in his footsteps with a vengeance.</p>
<p>A man who worked on Capitol Hill once described American politics as an arch, in which each group pressed for its own interests and the opposing pressures allowed the arch to stand.  If no one pushes back against Rep. Lee and her way of thinking, the arch of our country will fall. <br>

<p>We Anglo Saxons deserve some pride, but mostly condemnation.  We built it, then we allowed it to be destroyed all for the sake of those who aren&rsquo;t of us.  Stevens was liberal and a cause of the problem.  We need to start dividing Anglo Saxons into two groups.  Builders and Destroyers.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll volunteer!!!  Of course, I&rsquo;d be a disappointment to the gang in Washington because I&rsquo;m a white protestant male, educated in a non-Ivy League university.  Incidentally, I&rsquo;m not a lawyer either, but that should only liven up the decisons in which I would participate with a new and much needed far-right perspective.  The pay is good, social standing excellent, and I could hang on until I&rsquo;m in my 90s when my pontifications would get more and more interesting.</p>

<p>I regret to tell you that Justice Stevens was not of the same moral and intellectual stock that made this country great.  He was/is a radical Leftist on social issues and did not follow the Rule of Law, nor the Constitution, on myriad occasions.  I say good riddance to this pro-Affirmative Action, pro-abortion and advocate of gay rights. </p>
<p>Give me more with the jurisprudence of minorities like Thomas, and/or Catholics like Scalia, Alito and Roberts.  No more sell-outs like Stevens.</p>

<p>You are exactly right  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;ve been called &#8216;Cassandra&rsquo; or laughed at as believing in &#8216;silly&rsquo; conspiracy theories for stating this, although I&rsquo;m starting to see the first stirrings of concern here on the Front Line in California.</p>
<p>I look around me, and in California I don&rsquo;t have to look very far, and I am terrified by what I see  &mdash;  a mass of hostile, welfare-dependent, non-White faces waiting for the chance to &#8216;take over and take charge&rsquo;, never mind that I just paid a satanic tax bill to the state so they can hate me in comfort.</p>
<p>In California, there is massive underfunding of pensions (including mine) and social services.  At some point, the piper must be paid: What do you think will happen when the welfare gravy train dries up? When unemployment benefits finally run out? Will there be food and gasoline riots?  Will Whites be targeted for violence because &#8216;we caused all this&rsquo; or are perceived as &#8216;the haves&rsquo;?  Yes.   </p>
<p>Edmund Conelley points out:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The noose is tightening around our necks.</p>
<p>Croatian savant Tomislav Sunic envisions such a scenario for any group in America that might be targeted: &#8216;Thus, in order for the proper functioning of future Americanized society, the removal of millions of surplus citizens must become a social and possibly also an ecological necessity.&rsquo;&hellip; MacDonald made a similar observation, identifying what sectors might be targeted &#8216;and therefore worthy of mass murder&rsquo; .. They are the European-derived Whites populating vast areas of the American nation, particularly in the so-called &#8216;red states.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/ycl97ar</p>
<p>Do I believe the destruction of Whites and Western Civilization was carefully planned and has been and is being done on purpose?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stilled called Cassandra or Chicken Little when I point this out  &mdash;  although not as much as before, as the signs of doom are becoming impossible to ignore for us Whites.</p>
<p>As another well-known White National recently stated publicly:  &#8220;People!  Wake the **** up!&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is so ironic that the children of the people that fought to save America during WWII are the very people bent on destroying it.Most came from upper middle class and wealthy families.Rich bored white kids,who wanted a cause to fight for(as long as they didn&rsquo;t get hurt).NPR openly brags about how white youth rebellion was tied into the &#8220;civil rights movement&#8221;.Most of them did not know what they were doing,but because of the images the degenerates in Hollywood put in their minds they went along with the crowd.Remember the movie Citizen Kane?That is the media mindset,to make you think and do as they decide!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Great post. I&rsquo;m really glad that there peole out there such as yourself who kep track of the details. The endgame for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS-if OUR numbers are small enough: enslavement and then extermination.</p>
<p>Within a few years there will  exist a &#8220;US&#8221; supreme that wil openly promote hispanic,black and asian racial interests.</p>
<p>I believe the really big question is how will millions of our fellow NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS react to a massive loss of WHITE AMERICAN territory to china,india,pakistan,iran and mexico.</p>
<p>The traitors in the Republican should be very worried about the very real possibility that in the future they will be pervieved as traitors who allowed large parts of America to be taken over and colonized by other ations. The racial transformation of the &#8220;US&#8221; Supreme Court should be seen in this context.</p>

<p>But the problem is, it&rsquo;s too late now.  Now the blacks, non-whites, and other hates of white gentiles are in control.  Hell, we even have a racist, socialist black president controlling our country who is doing everything he can to take money from whites and give it to non-whites via taxes.  Our young white men are too emasculated to be pro-white and stand up to blacks and hispanics.  Our young white women are sleeping with blacks and hispanics.  What are we going to do?  We&rsquo;ll lose.  If we don&rsquo;t lose, it&rsquo;s going to be a very, VERY ugly battle</p>

		<p>Mostly likely I&rsquo;d bet the nominee is black or Asian. Black because that&rsquo;s what Obama would prefer, Asian to play the ID politics angle for the coming elections. It might be Jewish, given the strength of the Jewish lobby, but having 3 Jewish justices might not sit well with a lot of people.</p>
<p>But black, Hispanic, Asian, or Jewish, another another minority candidate would just slidify the growing belief among white Christians that today&rsquo;s Democratic Party does not care about them.</p>
<p>If Obama <i>really</i> wants to play the ID politics angle, and play it well, he&rsquo;ll pick&hellip;a white Protestant man. It would be totally unexpected, and it would cause people to rethink the growing suspicion that he&rsquo;s just a Marxist black bigot.</p>
<p>Of course that white male Protestant would be ideologically to the left of Karl Marx, but I guess you can&rsquo;t have everything.</p>

<p>Points well taken.  <br>
Unfortunately the only solution might be physical, not political, unless the Republican party magically starts representing white interests and gets 75% of the white vote.  I&rsquo;m not holding my breath. </p>
<p>There is one weakness that the black community has left open that could be taken advantage of by a few million motivated people.  They&rsquo;re mostly concentrated in densely populated, definable urban areas that aren&rsquo;t that large in land area and sometimes constrained by physical boundaries - rivers, interstate highways, mountains, etc.  People in those situations can be vulnerable to mass destruction by an intelligent invading force with overwhelming resources, including air power and catastrophic weaponry of various sorts.  </p>

<p>The white-haters have left open one weakness.  They live mostly in definable, densely populated urban areas that are relatively small in size and sometimes constrained by physical barriers - rivers, mountains, etc.  The people they hate have the advantage of population dispersal, superior financial resources, and a multiple-century history of being able to organize small but effective segments of their population for justifiable causes.</p>
