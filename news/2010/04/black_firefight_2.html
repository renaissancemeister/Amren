<h1>Black Firefighter&rsquo;s Suit Thrown Out</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Ross, Yale Daily News, April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The controversial U.S. Supreme Court case Ricci v. DeStefano is one step closer to final resolution.</p>
<p>Six months after a black New Haven firefighter charged the city with discrimination in a separate lawsuit, a federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the suit, which city officials had said was complicating Ricci v. DeStefano&rsquo;s final resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision confirms what should be a basic principle of law: A municipality should not be held liable for following a ruling of the United States Supreme Court,&#8221; New Haven Corporation Counsel Victor Bolden said in an e-mail Thursday.</p>
<p>The black firefighter, Michael Briscoe, sued New Haven in October, alleging that the city&rsquo;s 2003 firefighter promotional test had a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on blacks and unjustly prevented his promotion to lieutenant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Briscoe&rsquo;s attorney, David Rosen, said Thursday that despite the Court&rsquo;s ruling, the city was still liable for discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Briscoe&rsquo;s lawsuit claimed that the promotional test&rsquo;s format discriminated against black candidates because it weighted the written section more heavily than the oral section. (The oral section of the exam counted for 40 percent, while the written counted for 60 percent.) Rosen wrote that public safety officials across the country count the oral section as 70 percent and the written as 30.</p>
<p>Briscoe scored the highest of all 77 candidates for lieutenant on the oral section but was not promoted because his low written score dropped him to 24th place. The lawsuit claimed that Briscoe would have been one of the top candidates if the city had used a fairer evaluation system.</p>

		<p>So just because the test weighed the written section more heavily than the oral section means it put blacks at an unfair advantage? That claim alone makes Briscoe and his attorney, David Rosen the racists by implying that reading and writing are beyond the mental ability of blacks and they are therefore at more of a disadvantage compared to everybody else. It&rsquo;s ironic that the liberals now have to argue the exact opposite of their liberal equality propaganda as a means to get blacks more unearned advantage.</p>

		<p>Just go ahead an make him Fire Chief and get it over with.  He&rsquo;s black, so we owe him everything.  Didn&rsquo;t we inherit Fire Prevention and Fire Suppression techniques from the noble Africans we enslaved and forced to work from us for free?</p>
<p><br>
Why were blacks so careless with their lit matches during Reconstruction down South?</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t we help them atone for the sin of burning down White Peoples&rsquo; barns and businesses by denying them jobs as firemen?</p>

		<p>If my house catches fire I want the fire fought by a fireman who quickly realizes the best way to put out the fire. This calls for good and often fast reasoning skills. I certainly don&rsquo;t want decisions made by someone whose only qualification is skin color. But common sense these days is filtered through the social cancer of political correctness. Yes, on rare occasions common sense prevails but far too many decisions these days are decided by the proclivities of unelected judges. Proven and measurable merit should be the only factor in deciding important issures. Sadly it is not, and our country is rife with results of the madness inflicted on us by nation destroying liberalsim. </p>

		<p>Oral exams, honestly used, are a way to screen out smart candidates who did well on the written exam, but who are otherwise unworthy.  Giving subjective oral exams too much weight is simply a way around the whole idea of competitive exams, just what dumb Blacks and Hispanics want.</p>

		<p>Briscoe passed the oral exam and failed the written exam.<br>
In other words he was a empty fraud that could run his mouth<br>
but there was no substance behind it. He is missing his calling <br>
as a leader in black identity politics. Why be a fireman when <br>
you can be a Senator..or even a President.<br>
I am sure he also passed the personal appearance checklist<br>
by appearing at the exam in a Armani suit and Rolex watch.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many blacks I&rsquo;ve known who come across as the nicest guys in the world, but then it is eventually learned that they have committed some of the most egregious acts possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the reasons for it, but blacks can commit violence, fraud or some indiscretion yet act as if nothing serious has occurred right afterwards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the black who committed attempted murder, then instructed others on how to build a bomb, in a court case involving a murder trial in Daytona Beach, and having the judge declare that same black as a &#8220;nice guy who got in with the wrong crowd,&#8221; after his testimony which depicted him as a very likable sort.  He wound up murdering someone later and serving life in prison.</p>
<p>That black trait would exlain why black politicians who seem like the epitomes of reason and understanding, promising to bring change and uniting the races, would succeed so greatly, afterwhich they turn out to be nothing but anti-white racists who are so pro-black they are interested in nothing but elevating the black community and secretely hate whites.  And in spite of their obvious biases and inabilities, they retain the same likability as if nobody notices who they really are.  It&rsquo;s an amazing trait to behold.</p>

		<p>Oral exams are meant to complement the written exam, not replace it.  Oral exams are meant to determine if the applicant actually knows the technical aspects and can explain them, and can use them to reason out problems and situations, as opposed to merely being great at memorization.  But you NEED both.  Officers of any profession need to be able to read and comprehend directives, regulations, law, policies and implement them as well as WRITING THEM and proposing them coherently.  Moreover, officers are responsible for maintaining written reports, inventories, budgets, etc.<br>
At the officer level, it is as important probably MORE important to be literate than it is for the line fireman.  Any honorable man would accept the realization that better men were appointed.  Blacks don&rsquo;t care about the organization, safety, honor, integrity, professional ethics, professional or academic achievement.  They only care about getting what whitey has, but that which he hasn&rsquo;t been able to achieve on his own merits and intelligence.  </p>

		<p>Why did he not study for the written exam? If he had, he probably would have passed and been promoted to lieutenant since his oral test score was high. This is what a white or Asian applicant would do. If you blame the test, aren&rsquo;t you saying that you are not smart enough to pass the exam and get the promotion the old fashioned way  &mdash;  by earning it.</p>
