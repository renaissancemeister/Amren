			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael McNutt, News OK (Oklahoma City), April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Recruiting membership in an unauthorized militia or the Ku Klux Klan would be a crime if legislation approved Thursday by the House of Representatives becomes law.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is making unauthorized militias illegal,&#8221; said Rep. Mike Shelton, the amendment&rsquo;s author.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In Oklahoma, we have seen the damage done by militia fanatics,&#8221; said Shelton, referring to the truck bombing 15 years ago of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. &#8220;The Ku Klux Klan has a long history of violence and domestic terrorism,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SB 2018 passed 98-1. It now goes to the Senate.</p>
<p>Shelton&rsquo;s amendment was filed about a week after news reports indicated some in Oklahoma tea party groups supported a volunteer militia to help defend the state&rsquo;s sovereignty against federal government infringement. Several tea party leaders later said they had been talking about reinstituting a state guard, which would help with emergencies and would be under the direction of the governor and Legislature.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City, asked Shelton if he characterized the Black Panthers as an unauthorized militia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they going around terrorizing communities, doing drive-by shootings, using ammonium nitrate to blow up buildings?&#8221; Shelton asked. &#8220;When they start doing that, they would be considered (that).&#8221;<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s fine. Now what about the 35 Muslim militant training camps operated by Muslims of America located in boondocky areas all over our country?  I&rsquo;ve read that the FBI already has instructions not to interfere with these camps.  This doesn&rsquo;t preclude the states taking action against them.  But will they?  </p>

<p>This is unconstitutional according to the 2nd Amendment. The entire National Guard farce is unconstitutional as well.</p>
<p>The federal government does not have the power to regulate militias, which were originally intended to be created at the state level, although people have been allowed to create more local ones as well (and which is also likely allowed under the Constitution to prevent TYRANNY).</p>
<p>&#8220;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The terms &#8216;regulation&rsquo; and &#8216;state&rsquo; obviously have different meanings for our comrades in Congress than they did for the Founders.</p>
<p>Rag-tag bands formed at the drop of a hat in the several States to fight the British during our War for Independence.</p>

		<p>Shelton is the perfect example of a politician that needs to be booted come the next election.  He serves no benefit to white Americans and, above all, the Constitution.</p>
<p>Shelton appears to be broadbrushing all militias.  And, the Black Panthers intimidate voters so they are a terrorist organization.<br>

		<p>To 2-Anonymous:</p>
<p>A challenge to this so-called &#8220;law&#8221; can also be brought by militia groups by citing the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221; - 2nd Amendment to the Constitution of the U.S.</p>
<p>What exactly is the legal definition of a &#8216;militia&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the courts are beginning to revive this long forgotten but crucial &ldquo;general vs. special&rdquo; militia distinction. The 1990 Supreme Court case Perpich vs. Department of Defense is a case in point. Then Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich claimed the DoD violated the Constitution when it ordered the Minnesota National Guard (which he claimed was the &#8216;state militia&rsquo;) to duty outside the state without his consent or that of the state legislature.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled against Perpich. It held the National Guard is an integral component of the US Army Reserve system (it has been since 1916). It further supported its ruling by specifying the difference between the &ldquo;special militia&rdquo; (in this case the Minnesota Guard) instead of the &ldquo;general militia&rdquo; (citizens with privately procured and owned arms) as expressed in the 2nd Amendment. Also in 1990 the Court in another case affirmed the definition of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; expressed in the Bill of Rights as meaning individual persons, not a group.&#8221;</p>

		<p>All this is, is a black legislator attempting to control white people through legislation.  It won&rsquo;t work, though, because we have the right to form all kinds of groups under the Constitution.  Even the K has the right, despite Mr. Shelton&rsquo;s legislation, to meet.</p>

		<p>They also can&rsquo;t ban militias given the founding document ENDORSES militias, and defined the militia as all able bodied men capable of bearing arms.  Good luck on that one also.  As the comment says though, no mention of the Black Panthers, no mention of radical mosques, no mention of La Raza, MS13 or the crips and the bloods.  Just white militias and white nationalist organizations.  Let&rsquo;s just forget that McV had ties to Muslims, and let&rsquo;s not dig too deeply in where he got the money for all that amonium nitrate, all his travel, etc.</p>

<p>Huh?  LIke anything WHITE such as the K or &#8220;nazi&#8221; orgs are doing this? Since when has anyone WHITE did drive-bys?  Or terrorizing communities? That is all black and mexicans that do this sort of criminal activity!  Of course Mr. Shelton is BLACK.</p>

		<p>When I first read this article, I concluded that to comply with this bill, if it becomes law, then every man between the age of 17 and 45 who is not a convicted felon, physically disabled, adjudicated mentally insane or a Black Panther would either have to commit suicide or leave Oklahoma.  </p>
<p>I then read the comments at the original article, and Oklahoma state law&rsquo;s definition of &#8220;unorganized militia&#8221; is even looser   &mdash;   it comprises both genders of both U.S. Citizens and legal aliens in Oklahoma, between the ages of 17 and 70.  So even more people are going to have to commit suicide or leave Oklahoma than I thought.</p>
<p>As an aside, neither McV nor Terry Nichols had any connection with any organized or unorganized militia.  Nichols&rsquo;s brother, James, once attended an open forum hosted by one in Oklahoma, at which time he spouted off about how we don&rsquo;t need drivers licenses.  He was asked not to come back again with that mess, because if I expect to drive a motorized vehicle on a public road, I expect to pass something of a minimal state test and state standards to do so.  AMAF, I think it&rsquo;s too easy to get a drivers license and too hard to lose one. </p>

		<p>Reminds me of the time the government sent troops to seize the weapons and ammuntion of an unauthorized militia.  The militia members confronted the soldiers, and though initially routed, harassed them with sniper fire on their 20 mile retreat to their base, and, overnight, erected fortifications on the hills surrounding the troops.  Within days thousand of unauthorized militia members joined themon the hills.  It was April 19, 1775.</p>
<p>I have for years wondered what motivated those normally peaceful men to leave their farms, forges, taverns and shipyards to join a rebellion against government authority with no leader and no clear objective.  I wonder if there are any such men in this country today.</p>

		<p>Obviously the members of the Oklahoma House have had their minds polluted by SPLC propaganda.</p>
<p>Mike Shelton: <i>&ldquo;In Oklahoma, we have seen the damage done by militia fanatics,&rdquo; said Shelton, referring to the truck bombing 15 years ago of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.</i></p>
<p>Mike Shelton is apparently unaware that Timothy McV was not a member of a militia, and did not operate under the authority of any militia.  Shelton has been drinking Mr. Potok&rsquo;s Kool Aid.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Are they going around terrorizing communities, doing drive-by shootings, using ammonium nitrate to blow up buildings?&rdquo; Shelton asked. &ldquo;When they start doing that, they would be considered (that).&rdquo;<i></i></i></p>
<p>Can this guy give any example of militias that have done drive by shootings, used ammonium nitrate to blow up buildings, or terrorized communities?  So far only loner Timothy McVe, the Muslims who did the bombing of the World Trade Center, and the radical left Weather Underground (Obama&rsquo;s friends) have blown up buildings.  The drive by shootings and terrorizing of communities is done by gangs like the Bloods, Crips, MS-13, and Latin Kings, not by white guys doing target practice in the woods with AR-15s.</p>
<p>The entire militia movement was born as a reaction to gun grabbing liberals.  Liberals tried to argue that the 2nd Amendment doesn&rsquo;t apply to individuals because they aren&rsquo;t members of a &#8220;well regulated militia&#8221;, so only members of a state National Guard could have guns.  So some guys who wanted to keep their guns decided to create well regulated militias of their own.<br>

<p>Wake up, White people.   This is a preview of worse things to come, if we allow ourselves to be reduced to a minority within our own country and are ruled over by hostile non-whites, such as this black Shelton fellow.   Our Constitution and our Bill of Rights was crafted and written by 100 percent white men and these documents were meant to be a guarantee of liberty for the white descendants (Posterity) of those 100 percent white Founders.   Not a single non-white brain cell had anything whatsoever to do with the concepts that lead to the creation of either of those sacred documents - but, I will guarantee one thing - once minorities like Shelton seize absolute, maximum, unchecked power over white people in America - those documents will be transformed and interpreted in ways that will make a mockery of our white Founding Father&rsquo;s original intent, and whites are going to be numerically powerless to prevent this from occurring.   </p>

		<p>This is part of the larger War on Whites  &mdash;  pass Hate Speech laws to shut us up and now this  &mdash;  pass laws disallowing us to meet to form self interest groups, as ALL of them will be declared White Militia no matter what the cause.</p>
<p>Little by little Whites will be denied ANY civil rights, speech or right to organize to promote our best interests  &mdash;  all of it will be declared Hate Crimes punishable by hard prison time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the hypocritical Representative is taking his marching orders from whomever or whatever organization is funding his campaigns, and perhaps funding a lot more for him personally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton and Obama are pushing the UN  &#8220;Small Arms Treaty&#8221; to confiscate our guns.</p>
<p>Heard anything about this in the msm?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The United States reversed policy on Wednesday and said it would back launching talks on a treaty to regulate arms sales &hellip;The decision, announced in a statement released by the U.S. State Department, overturns the position of former President George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration, which had opposed such a treaty on the grounds that national controls were better.</p>
<p><br>
On Wednesday Obama Took the First Major Step in a Plan to Ban All Firearms in the United States . The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for US citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the US State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress. Once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2cozmvj</p>
<p>This is being done in secret.  So while Obama can appear before the public and proclaim that he is not trying to &#8216;ban or confiscate our guns&rsquo;, Hillary Clinton is secretly committing the US to international treaties and foreign gun control laws.</p>
<p>We are being attacked on All Fronts these days.</p>
<p>From QD:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;As an aside, neither McV nor Terry Nichols had any connection with any organized or unorganized militia&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>There are so many unanswered questions about the Oklahoma City Bombing, although the government&rsquo;s official stance is that N and McV, two White supremacist acting along and with deep grudges against the government, filled a Ryder truck with fertilizer and fuel oil which miraculously took out a re-inforced government building and created a 30-foot crater. </p>
<p> The official government version of the bombing is used constantly and conveniently  as &#8216;evidence&rsquo; to go after so-called White militia  &mdash;  with the definition of &#8216;militia&rsquo; being anything the government says it is.</p>
<p>From the above article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;..In Oklahoma, we have seen the damage done by militia fanatics,&rdquo; said Shelton, referring to the truck bombing 15 years ago of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>From a supposed FBI memo: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;References to an informant working for the SPLC at Elohim City on the eve of the Oklahoma City bombing raises serious questions as to what the SPLC might know about McV&rsquo;s activities during the final hours before the fuse was lit in Oklahoma City – but which the SPLC has failed to disclose publicly.</p>
<p>Questioned during a press conference at Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant recently, Dees confirmed someone from his organization was inside the white supremacist compound at Elohim City on April 17, 1995.</p>
<p>&#8216;If I told you what we were doing there, I would have to kill you,&rsquo; Dees replied when pressed to explain what this person was doing at a terrorist training camp&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The militia ban will never stand a court challenge, as it is an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of association.  A ban on criminal gang recruiting would probably pass muster, though, as it is a crime to be part of an organized criminal conspiracy, and the words &#8220;organized criminal conspiracy&#8221; are a very accurate description of what a street gang is.</p>

		<p>An additional fault that will scuttle this law when challenged is that what constitutes a &#8220;militia&#8221; is completely subjective.  I used to belong to a World War Two battle-reenactment organization.  Is a bunch of guys who dress up in period uniforms or reproductions thereof and run around in the woods firing blank-adapted guns at each other a &#8220;militia&#8221;?  A prosecutor wouldn&rsquo;t bother with Revolutionary or Civil War reenactors, but World War Two uniforms and weapons might attract some interest.</p>
<p>Will prosecutors start asking for membership lists of local private shooting ranges?  If they do, they can count on area police departments being told they are no longer allowed free use of the facilities.</p>
