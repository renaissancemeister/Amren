<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/us/18border.html?hpw">Fleeing Drug Violence, Mexicans Pour Into US</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James C. McKinley, Jr., New York Times, April 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In El Paso alone, the police estimate that at least 30,000 Mexicans have moved across the border in the past two years because of the violence in Ju√°rez and the river towns to the southeast. So many people have left El Porvenir and nearby Guadalupe Bravos that the two resemble ghost towns, former residents say. </p>
<p>People without access to visas, however, have been seeking asylum, even at the risk of being detained for months. In the early days of the conflict, the asylum-seekers were mostly journalists, police officers and officials who had been threatened by organized crime. But now people with ordinary jobs are showing up at the border and saying they fear for their lives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But few Mexicans are granted asylum. Over the last three federal fiscal years, immigration judges heard 9,317 requests across the country, and granted only 183.</p>

		<p>183 is way too many asylum requests that should have been granted. Why are no asylums being granted to white South Africans, who are being subject to slow motion genocide?They would be a lot more beneficial to our country.Who cant make up a bogus claim that they are in danger?</p>

		<p>Do these illegal aliens fleeing Mexico really think they can escape drug-related violence? In truth, drug-related violence will only follow the Mexicans wherever they go, as Vincente Fox, the former president of Mexico, once said, &#8220;where there are Mexicans, there is Mexico.&#8221; (No argument there, Mr. Fox!)</p>

		<p>Forty years ago Whites were 90% of the population of the U.S.  The so-called &#8220;experts&#8221; projected a few years ago that we would be a minority by 2050.  They then changed their projection to 2042.  Much of the decline in our percentage of the population has occurred in the last 20 years.  The rate of entry into the U.S. by illegal aliens has picked up.  Some estimate that there are as many as 30 million illegal aliens here now.  If this is true then we are really 60% of the population right now.  It appears that there&rsquo;s going to be amnesty for them, and if that be the case then we are going to be a minority in the very near future.  Once that happens the rate of entry will increase even beyond what it is at this moment.  We&rsquo;re looking at 10-15 years - if that.  </p>

		<p>If there was no welfare for them, would they still come here?</p>
<p>If we cut off the welfare, would they stay?</p>
<p>Is this really about &#8220;drug violence&#8221; or is it about redirecting welfare money into the mexican drug economy?</p>
<p>Some of those people might be &#8220;afraid&#8221; but many more of them are emloyees of the very drug cartels they are supposedly &#8220;fleeing&#8221;.</p>
<p>The easy way to settle this issue is to make it impossible for them to use welfare. If they have to get jobs and pay their own way, those that are here for these reasons will stay.  Those that are here to be criminals will mysteriously vanish.</p>
<p>I suspect that cutting off all welfare on a national level to mexicans would empty our country of them.</p>

<p>Well, that is 183 too many as far as I am concerned!</p>
<p>That is because one must as a critical question here. How do these &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; Mexicans pay us back when they are granted asylum or citizenship? The first thing they do, is to begin fantasizing that they have extraordinary &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; because they have suffered wrongs by the &ldquo;Anglos&rdquo; they want to live with. </p>
<p>Go figure?</p>
<p>Personally, I think we should conquer Mexico, remove its ruling &ldquo;elites,&rdquo; and administer it as a NWCDZ, Nonwhite and Communist Dumping Zone. This is only fair, since Mexico seems to think we need 100 million of them living here; thus, we should teach them the error of their ways, by enriching them with tens of millions of progressive and diverse groups not currently present in this country.</p>
<p>Can you not wonder, where Mexico might be in 50 years if: Obama, Pelosi, Reid, Steele, McCain, Jindhal, Biden, and Emmanuelle are contributing their talents there? To say nothing of the industrious &ldquo;migrants&rdquo; from allover the world we could deliver to them as well.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;people fleeing the violence, some of whom were involved in drug dealing in Mexico, has disrupted Fort Hancock&rsquo;s peaceful rhythms&hellip;.A few children among the refugees belong to families involved in the drug trade, and rival gang members have threatened them, bringing the specter of gangland killings to the high school, law enforcement and school officials say&hellip;&rsquo;if you want to get at somebody, you get at their children.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Do the powerful people who publish the NYTimes, and a sizable portion of the powerful people who will read this article in the NYTimes, care a whit about the effect of this madness on our own country?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so, because they view their own ethnic interests as furthered by anything that lessens the cohesion of white society.</p>
<p>Until the ethnic group that now provides the most powerful members of our media, banking, and government stops viewing its history as a tale of unbroken innocence that has been violated repeatedly and relentlessly by European evil (against which they believe they must take all measures to protect themselves), their admirable abilities will continue to be more of an impediment than an aid in our salvation.</p>
<p>In particular, they will continue to press for amnesty for illegals, though there is beginning to be some important dissent among their numbers&hellip;Stephen Steinlight&rsquo;s landmark piece about his &#8220;conversion&#8221; on immigration is fascinating reading:</p>

		<p>There is no more pressing issue for this country&hellip;excluding the economy&hellip;..than the threat in Mexico.  </p>
<p> Leave it to this out-of-touch administration to pay more attention to Iran&hellip;.a country that wouldn&rsquo;t dare attack us&hellip;.to one that is close to cartel takeover, which would mean we could very possibly have a narco-republic on the southern border, which would have very close covert ties to Hugo Chavez and Muslim extremists.</p>
<p>The Sinaloa, Gulf and Los Zetas cartels&hellip;the three most powerful of the five cartels&hellip;..are fighting each other right now in Juarez and Tijuana for control of the US corrider.  Just recently the Zetas broke away from the Gulf Cartel.</p>
<p>In spite of their ongoing war with each other, they still are powerful enough to spring ambushes against the police and military, set up barricades to military bases in order to lay seige to them, plus confront the federales on the streets in head to head encounters.</p>
<p>Experts tell us these drug gangs could easily field a 100,000 man army, and they are armed as well as the Mexican military.  The threat of takeover is very real.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been pointed out many times, but it bears repeating:  If these gangs ever decide there&rsquo;s plenty of money for everybody and recognize that their greatest strength is in unity, they could well defeat the Mexican government.  Military analysts think it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before that occurs.</p>
<p>So, as usual, the big shot elitists in Washington dwell on a nation that is thousands of miles away and could do us no real harm without getting bombed back to the stone-age rather than giving adequate attention to an entire country that could be fighting us from the south, while Mexicans in the US would be initiating insurgent battles.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they&rsquo;re leaving the border unguarded&hellip;&hellip;putting the priority on monitoring middle aged tea party activists&hellip;&hellip; and concentrating on demonizing a country that has never attacked anybody, in order to build a case for attacking it as they did Iraq, while additional hordes of Mexican patriots add to the insurgency base that&rsquo;s already here.  Too, I&rsquo;m wondering how many so-called Mexican-Americans would be taking up arms against the US in order to aide their tribal kin south of the border, afterwhich they would throw open the gates at the border to allow their tribesmen to come rushing in to sack Rome once again.  Do they ever learn?</p>

		<p>The &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; enters its 96th year, having formally began at the federal level with the passage of the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914.  It&rsquo;s a total failure; drugs won a long time ago.  The only question is whether the drug trade shall remain illegal - and thus stay in the hands of hyper-violent narco-cartels - or whether this country shall finally come to its senses, learn the lessons of our ancestors who lived during alcohol prohibition, and sensibly decriminalize, regulate, and tax coca, opium, and hemp.</p>
<p>Ending the drug war would knock the Mexican drug mafias out of business, enhance law and order in Mexico, cut down on corruption, and reduce the incentive for Mexicans to flee their troubled country to el Norte.</p>
<p>The sooner we make the transition, the better.</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen on the TV crime shows (like First 48 and Crime 360) some of these foreign-born, culturally third-world Mexicans are worse than hardcore ghetto criminals in their total disregard for law and human life.  Instead of just holding up women and old people, they shoot them in the head or slit their throats and then callously stroll away.  <br/>
Anyone who wants to get a realistic look at what the U.S. faces should watch these programs.  Rarely are any of the perps white (except in the First 48 dvd&rsquo;s, where the producers picked and chose what episodes to use).</p>

		<p>It will do no such thing Karl.  Corruption is a way of life in third world countries.<br/>
It&rsquo;s ingrained.  Part of the cutlure and part of the morality.  The drug cartels exist in Mexico WITH the assent of the Mexican government.  Same with Columbia and other cartel countries.  Oh, sure, NOW Mexico and Columbia see a problem.  They did NOT see a problem when the cartels were getting started though.  They LIKED those payoffs and the inflated living drug money provided them.  Mexico is reaping what it has sowed.  But why is all that OUR problem?  Rats deserting a ship are still RATS ya know?  They bring their diseases, behaviors, and breeding habits along with them when they leave the sinking ship, and infect wherever they landed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;which would mean we could very possibly have a narco-republic on the southern border, which would have very close covert ties to Hugo Chavez and Muslim extremists&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The narco-mexican/international drug cartels are already here.</p>
<p>Recently, in Hemet, a California town in the high desert area (known for meth labs):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;First, a natural gas pipe was shoved through a hole drilled into the roof of the gang enforcement unit&rsquo;s headquarters. The building filled with flammable vapor but an officer smelled the danger before anyone was hurt.</p>
<p>Then, a ballistic contraption was attached to a sliding security fence around the building. An officer opening the black steel gate triggered the mechanism, which sent a bullet within eight inches of his face.</p>
<p>In another attempted booby trap attack, some kind of explosive device was attached to a police officer&rsquo;s unmarked car while he went into a convenience store.</p>
<p>Several Hemet city trucks were torched late Tuesday night, and authorities are investigating whether the incidents are connected to a string of attacks on the area&rsquo;s police&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The media and government instantly blamed a motorcycle gang, and conducted a major sweep of &#8216;terrorist gang members.&rsquo;  The police have not been able to link the motorcycle gangs to the string of attacks:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Members of a Riverside County motorcycle gang have denied having anything to do with a string of attacks on Hemet police officers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the attacks weren&rsquo;t carried out by a motorcycle gang  &mdash;  these are the terrorist acts of mexican/international drug cartels who use these same tactics in mexico to intimidate and terrorize police (notice the gang unit was targeted first)  &mdash;  next will be judges and political officials, those who resist &#8216;la mordida&rsquo; (large cash bribes) or insist on prosecuting drug gang members will be assassinated along with their entire families, as is being done in mexico.  </p>
<p>Hell, the cartels are already allowed by our government into our American national parks to set up large, sophisticated pot farms destroying the fragile environment, about which the paid-off Sierra Club couldn&rsquo;t care less.   </p>
<p>Which is more of a threat to US citizens  &mdash;  Iran, Tea Partiers or mexican/international drug cartels that are setting up operations in our national parks and attacking our police officers?</p>
<p>According to the government, Iran is the bigger threat.  Watch for a false flag operation soon  &mdash;  a Gulf of Tonkin-type incident to prompt the US into attacking a country which is not threat to us.  The pressure on the tea partiers will continue as well.</p>
<p>The ONLY solution, as Karl writes in post #18 is to legalize drugs to take the drug business out of the hands of violent cartels, end the insane, endless, mindless &#8216;War on Drugs&rsquo;, stop pouring taxpayers money down a rat hole, free up space in our prisons for murderers and child rapists and direct law enforcement to fight crimes.</p>
<p>Legalize drugs now, all of them, the sooner the better. </p>

		<p>Anonymous #16, the Mexican invasion is actually a significant INGREDIENT in the economic downturn. The influx of cheap labor which is putting many Americans out of work and out of business; the absurd amounts of money being funneled out of this country to Mexico by Mexican citizens working illegally in this country, the obscene amount of unrecoverable bills for alien healthcare and social services that is drowning the system; the hidden but sizeable costs of crime, injury and judicial services required because of illegals, all contribute to the huge expenditures that must be paid by someone. That someone is you and I.</p>

ranger, in his fine post, writes:</p>
<p>You both make many good points.  I used to agree that &#8220;recreational&#8221; drugs ought to be legalized, but my experience in Eastern Europe changed that opinion.  Here&rsquo;s why; many of the Islamic AND Nationalist gangs (mafias) profit from cigarette smugling.  (They also engage in heroin smuggling).  They make profits by skirting the tax laws.  This has also led to very poor, even dangerously poor cigarettes from flooding markets there.  It is so easy to do that many young people do it.  I knew of a few who got sucked into smuggling heroin for the Russian mafia.  When they got scared, the mafia threatened their families, etc.  One man I knew had to pay off the mafia to leave his son and his girlfriend alone. It was very dangerous.  The heroin still gets up into Northern Europe as far as Norway, where addicted Norwegians wander around with their clothes falling off opened to every sort of personal crime (I&rsquo;ve seen young women like this there). </p>
<p>Lately, this same cigarette smugling has become a big deal on the internet.  One local case that I inadvertently ran across, was a politically conservative, ederly cigarette smoker who was buying these types of cigarettes online from a source based in New Mexico.  After about three orders, his credit card charges went sky high and the outfit disappeared with all his personal info.  Why was he buying cigarettes online?  In order to get them cheaper and escape local taxes.</p>
<p>Making &#8220;recreational&#8221; drugs legal will only increase problems like identity theft and health concerns about quality, etc., as well as expand greatly, the already terrible amount of human tragedies.  It will not stop cartels from farming pot in our national forests, nor will it stop meth from being produced and distributed in order to dodge taxes.  Meanwhile, it will create government sponsored drug dealers.  I can just imagine the frauds that the tax payers will be supporting then.  Both are easier to produce than moonshine.  One must be mindful that liguor tax and enforcement was established when laws could be enforced in a much more linear fashion.  Today, not many care to produce cheap booze because they want to know that it is safe, taxed properly, etc.  Liquor is liquid, these other substances are much easier to contain and transport, and in any quantity, even very small.</p>
<p>I think that laws that allow people to grow &#8220;weed&#8221; for personal use is a better idea than making all drugs legal.  With home grower/consumers, you cut the feet out from the growers suppliers that come from everywhere, and with across the board legality would only expand their crimes, not curtail them.</p>

		<p>The US wanted a war on drugs.</p>
<p>Now it has one. Right on its own borders. And soon to come to a town near you.</p>
<p>But the war on drugs is such a fixture with the American people and elites that it is doubtful if we will see real change in the near future. The war benefits the elites insofar as it has given the state extraordinary police powers, as well as the right to project power globally in the interests of &#8220;fighting drugs,&#8221; from the Andes to Afghanistan. </p>
<p>At the same time, the war on drugs is war on the cheap insofar as the investment in public funds is but a fraction of that for the big war in the Middle East. And much of the cost is subsidized by asset forfeiture and other such things. The government gets the benefit of fighting a war without costing it too much.</p>
<p>Until now, when the thing seems to be exploding in everyone&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>And as for your average American&hellip;what do they get out of the drug war? Entertainment on the nightly news? A belief that they are secure because they see SWAT teams kicking in people&rsquo;s doors on television?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that the US government can devote tremendous law enforcement and military resources to repressing drugs, especially within the USA itself, but chooses to not secure the borders. Consider the expansion of police powers to fight drugs: no-knock raids, roving wiretaps, asset forfeiture, universal surveillance (especially via drug testing), paramilitary police forces, attacks on alternative healthcare providers, massive expansion of the prison-industrial complex, even the Pentagon getting involved. Yet at the same time, government, corporations and even organized religion turns a blind eye to the massive violation of American laws by illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>Sam Francis had a term for this sort of phenomenon: &#8220;Anarcho-Tyranny.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Karl thanks for making that comment. </p>
<p>The majority of comments on these sites make me shake my head, and make me realize I have little in common with the &#8220;traditional right&#8221; and nothing at all with the &#8220;loony left&#8221;.</p>
<p><br/>
Bill R&rsquo;s. comment reminds me of something I once said to my father.  I was talking about prohibition and said how much illegal money in put into gangster&rsquo;s pockets.  My dad, being the deeply reflective and thoughtful person he is (sarcasm), said something to the effect all those Italians know is crime, if it wasn&rsquo;t for prohibition those Italians would have created other crime syndicates.  I replied, but would they have had the source of income that they had, and much like when someone says something that makes sense on Fox News&hellip; well all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>The simple fact is&hellip; Mexico doesn&rsquo;t have a drug problem, America has a drug problem.</p>
<p>The simple inability of much of the traditional right to see this is simply amazing&hellip;  </p>
<p>Reminds me of the right&rsquo;s support for wars of aggression in the middle east.  No Fox News watching, drug hating, I voted for Reagen Republican wants to live next door to Muslims; but they fail to see the simple fact that fighting them over there, so we don&rsquo;t have to over here simply creates a lot of refugees.  More disgruntled Refugees who might be tempted to commit acts of terrorism thus making us attack their countries more only to get more refugees.  Ein Teufelskreis (Devil&rsquo;s circle) or catch 22 in English.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before&hellip; the traditional right&rsquo;s solutions to problems seems to me to be just like the story Brer Rabbit and the Tar Baby (the first part at least).  That is why I consider myself an independent.  The Moral-Majority, Christian Conservative, Republican right-wing is just as responsible for this country&rsquo;s problems if not more so.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t take marching orders from Ronald Reagen, Sarah Palin, Lindsey Graham, Bill Bennet, Newt Gingrich, ad infinitum ad nauseum, and some of my favorite votes I got to cast were in the primaries for Buchanan in &#8216;96 and Ron Paul in &#8216;08. </p>
<p>&#8220;He who thinks a great deal is not suited to be a party man: he thinks his way through the party and out the other side too soon.&#8221;<br/>

		<p><i>Forty years ago Whites were 90% of the population of the U.S. The so-called &ldquo;experts&rdquo; projected a few years ago that we would be a minority by 2050. They then changed their projection to 2042. Much of the decline in our percentage of the population has occurred in the last 20 years. The rate of entry into the U.S. by illegal aliens has picked up. Some estimate that there are as many as 30 million illegal aliens here now. If this is true then we are really 60% of the population right now. It appears that there&rsquo;s going to be amnesty for them, and if that be the case then we are going to be a minority in the very near future. Once that happens the rate of entry will increase even beyond what it is at this moment. We&rsquo;re looking at 10-15 years - if that. </i></p>
<p>Actually, the Mexican wave of the 1990s and 2000s was due to a huge differential in birth rates twenty years before, in the 1970s, between white Americans and Mexicans. In the mid-1970s, white Americans averaged 1.5 children per woman but Mexicans were at about five, over three times higher. Consequently, when those babies grew up, you had a huge wave of Mexicans heading toward El Norte.</p>
<p>Now, however, the Mexican birth rate advantage over white Americans has almost vanished   &mdash;   2.1 for Mexicans versus 1.8 for white Americans. In 2030, Mexican illegal immigration will likely no longer be a concern.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s like blaming the carjack victim for driving an expensive vehicle that&rsquo;s in demand at the chop shops.  Or blaming the rape victim, because she looked sexy in a particular outfit, and claiming that both parties are at fault for creating carjackers and rapists.</p>
<p>Understand that without the drug suppliers there would be no addicts to begin with.  That perhaps they are now catering to a population of users that were created by other dopers doesn&rsquo;t relieve them of any responsibility, nor does it assign legitimate blame to the users.</p>
<p>Mexico has a VERY big drug problem, and they too want to create the impression that they are victims in this violent drug scene and the US is the evil perpetrators for allowing its users to buy their ill-gotten product, but the logic doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.  I notice Hillary used the same argument.</p>
<p>Too, there is a very large portion of the Mexican population who are users, so, yes, Mexico DOES have a drug problem.</p>
<p>The only answer is to legalize drugs.  Take the profit out of them as was done to alcohol, and the drug gangs will be no more than criminals looking to pursue another line of crime.  Some of them might even get jobs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that figure (2.1/woman) elsewhere and I don&rsquo;t believe it for a minute. There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s true with the way those Mexican women pop out babies.</p>
