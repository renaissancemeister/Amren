<h1>Long-Ago Black Community Adds to the Picture of Early Vermont</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Bushnell, Times Argus (Barre, Vermont), April 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With these words, Vermont historian Elise Guyette begins the extraordinary story of a group of families living on a hill in Hinesburg starting in 1795. What makes these eight families noteworthy is that they were African-American.</p>
<p>Guyette&rsquo;s description of their lives here enriches our understanding of what early Vermont was like. {snip} Far from being an exotic exception to the rule, argues Guyette in her new book, &#8220;Discovering Black Vermont: African American Farmers in Hinesburgh, 1790-1890, &#8220;these families and others like them were an important aspect of Vermont society from the very start.</p>
<p>True, blacks made up only 0.2 or 0.3 percent of all Vermonters between 1790 and 1870, but Guyette notes that they often lived in clusters that made them a much more visible part of some communities. In 1790, for example, they represented 7 percent of the population of Vergennes. Ten years later, they comprised about 4 percent of Braintree. In 1810, Ferrisburgh had the state&rsquo;s largest black population with 48 residents, or about 3 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Guyette found in probate records that several of the Hinesburg families&rsquo; houses were clustered on the land of one family, a settlement pattern that might hearken back to African traditions. Indeed, some of the residents might have been born in Africa  &mdash;  birth records for many of the older family members don&rsquo;t exist  &mdash;  before being kidnapped and enslaved in America. Some male African-Americans in Vermont gained their freedom in return for their service during the Revolution.</p>
<p><b>A hard place</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Although Vermont was the first state to outlaw adult slavery in its Constitution, in 1777, racism still lurked in the Green Mountains. In delving into the lives of family members, Guyette didn&rsquo;t have anything as simple as a diary to work with. Instead, she had to rely on the experiences of other black Vermonters, as well as grand lists and pension and probate records, to get a feel for their lives. Other African-Americans in Vermont suffered vandalism, slander and lawsuits from their neighbors. The Clarks and the other Hinesburg families probably were not immune from such strife.</p>
<p>To understand the racism the families of the Hill (now known as Lincoln Hill) might have experienced, Guyette drew on the experiences of Charles Bowles. A black Free Will Baptist preacher who lived in nearby Huntington, Bowles learned that some whites objected to being preached to by a black man. When Bowles arranged to lead a group of parishioners to a lake in Hinesburg and baptize them, a gang of white men schemed to seize Bowles, tie him to a wooden horse and throw him into the lake.</p>
<p>Bowles got wind of the plan and announced that he would continue to sing and preach, even if he was attacked. According to Bowles&rsquo; biographer, the gang dropped the plan when the men realized the preacher refused to be intimidated.</p>
<p>Bowles also faced insults from community leaders. Once, he had been invited to tea and spoke amiably about religion in the parlor with the man of the house. When tea was ready, however, he was shown to the kitchen and served his tea alone.</p>
<p>Guyette also found evidence of trust between the races. For example, one black widow turned to a white neighbor, whom she had long known, to represent her in probate court when she could have asked a black neighbor to help. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Leaving the Hill</b></p>
<p>In general, however, it is unclear how much the families of the Hill interacted with people in the surrounding area. {snip} We do know, however, that the three adult males living in the Hill community in 1808 were paying poll taxes, which indicates they were making the trek into town to vote.</p>
<p>They took on other civic responsibilities as well. Men from the families fought in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Civil War.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But she [Guyette] found they [the blacks] couldn&rsquo;t maintain their prosperity. Rising economic uncertainty and racism in the years preceding the Civil War played a role in the families&rsquo; declining fortunes. One by one during the mid- to late 19th century, the families would decide to leave the Hill, hoping to find better opportunities elsewhere. {snip}</p>
<p>Guyette believes that their story is integral to understanding Vermont today. Thinking of Vermont as one of the whitest states in the nation is misleading, she argues. It has always been more of a blend than most people realize.</p>

		<p>It is curious how the reporter and the historian, in their quest to uncover the alleged history of anti-black racism in Vermont, both neglect to provide a mention of Alexander Twilight.</p>
<p>Mr. Twilight, in the early 19th Century was the first Black in the US to earn a college degree. He was a school principal, and a Congregational minister. In 1836 he became the first Black to be elected to a statewide office when he won election to the Vermont Assembly.</p>
<p>   &#8220;Thinking of Vermont as one of the Whitest states in the nation is misleading, she argues. It has always been more of a blend than most people realize.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1830 Vermont had a population of 881 Blacks, comprising 0.314% of the total population of 280,652. Now I&rsquo;m just a Western White male, as such, I can never hope to be as bright as the dullest womyn or person of color. But, it seems to me that adding a minority of 0.324% to a majority of 99.686% will not result in much of a blend. In fact, the majority will absorb the minority without a trace.</p>
<p>But our new multicult regime demands that the stories of the footnote people, the post-scripts and the has-beens take priority over the majority. Thus our history must be updated and improved by the &#8220;inclusion&#8221; of previously &#8220;excluded&#8221; groups. So much that our past is now viewed as a random assortment of dissimilar groups battling for power and influence, majorities be damned.</p>
<p>Thus a minority of 0.314% needs to be viewed as &#8220;integral&#8221; to our understanding the majority of 99.686%.</p>

		<p>When he talks of black people losing their farms or moving away from certain areas during the late 19th centuty he makes it sould as if this only happened to black people. </p>
<p>My ancestors moved several times in the late 19th century and ended up on a small farm in Tennessee and they lost that in the great depression. What really happened was that it got hard for anyone to make it on a small farm and anyone that was young enough and strong enough headed for the city and factories or to the mines to work for actual cash money. </p>
<p>When people look back at the lives of blacks they sure had it hard because there were no social programs but they should also look at the lives of many white people because their lives were not easy either. </p>

These stories turn up all the time. &#8216;A black man once lived here&rsquo; story. This is supposed to prove how we&rsquo;ve always been multicultural and transforming white communities into black communities is nothing more than setting things right.</p>

<p>Kidnapped? I think not. Noted black activist and &#8220;beer summiteer&#8221; Henry Louis Gates Jr. admitted that black slaves were not &#8220;kidnapped&#8221; but were sold to white slave traders by rival African tribes. But unpleasant facts like that would interrupt the narrative of evil whites and noble, put upon blacks.</p>
<p><i>Thinking of Vermont as one of the whitest states in the nation is misleading, she argues.</i></p>
<p>I never thought of it that way. I&rsquo;ve never been to Vermont, but judging from pictures I&rsquo;ve seen in calendars and picture books, I&rsquo;ve long thought it was one of the most beautiful states in the nation.  I guess that one state of affairs would explain the other.</p>

		<p>Once a proudly White state, Vermont has been infested and overwhelmed with trendy liberals fleeing the multiculti sewers that their failed &#8220;tolerance&#8221; has made of their own states.  But apparently the guilt of abandoning all that steaming Diversity is too much for them, since they do everything in their considerable economic power to make Vermont as much like Southern California as possible.</p>
<p>Native Vermonters are choking under a swelling sea of PBS liberals and cultural marxists who have nothing better to do with their angst-ridden time than to dig up a tiny minority and parade their alleged persecution so all White transplants can wring their hands in proper remorse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting to see the magnificently beautiful and  once-admirable state of Vermont contaminated by the heirs of Lenin.  Liberal White Flight has there truly reached its most loathsome nadir.  And the Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s hippies who have now made it their playpen won&rsquo;t be satisfied until the Green Mountain State becomes the Diverse Sanctuary State.<br>

I took a friend to Hawaii under the one condition he go with me to see Don Ho. Turned out it was his 14th show before he died. I estimated the number of nightly shows in his 40+ years of show business and then came up with the number 99.838% to show my firend how lucky he was to see the concert and also have a friend like me.</p>

		<p>Historical research into the African American past is always problematical to liberal knee jerkers. Excavation research money into black housing on plantations magically dried up when flints and shot were found in just about every dig. This meant that in the 18th century slaves were armed. When you out number your masters three to one and you all have guns,slavery becomes a choice and no other explanation is possible. Three squares and a flop were better to them than being fried at a Cherokee barbecue or being the guest of honor at a party of the three black bears.<br>
     The propaganda movie Armistad  became a cause celeb not to talk about after research proved that the black hero played by Morgan Freeman became a slave owner after his freedom. Research into Memphis balck history came to a screeching hault when it was learned that General Nathan Bedford Forrest was a hero to them. He spoke before the court in favor of black lawyers and campaigned for black sanitation workers to be paid the same as whites. The only things that grow in Vermont are rocks and rebels was a lament that was true until every other gay couple decided to flee butch Boston and take over the government. It is rumored that the last few blacks still there are planning to get out. Blacks can`t abide pederasts.<br>

<p>Blacks were not &#8220;kidnapped&#8221; from Africa. They were slaves of other African tribes who were sold to whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other African-Americans in Vermont suffered vandalism, slander and lawsuits from their neighbors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps. But I&rsquo;ll bet blacks brought more than their share of &#8220;vandalism, slander and lawsuits&#8221; to their unfortunate white neighbors.</p>

		<p>In America today everything black or, excuse me, &#8220;African American&#8221; is allegedly fascinating and of great value to posterity and the modern day alike. The first black anything is &#8220;historic&#8221; and therefore automatically important and of unique significance. Why any of this is honestly valuable to whites, other than to wallow in everlasting guilt and repentance of course, is anybody&rsquo;s guess. Indeed, blacks themselves rarely seem all that concerned with or impressed by their own history, unless of course it can be manipulated into financial gain or political power of some sort. Still, all this &#8220;black-history&#8221; is supposedly of the greatest importance to Americans. <br>
