<h1>Protesters Scorn $28M Senegal Heroic Statue</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark John, Reuters, April 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Senegal inaugurated its giant &#8220;African Renaissance&#8221; monument on Saturday, brushing aside complaints that the $28-million personal project of President Abdoulaye Wade was a waste of money and un-Islamic.</p>
<p>Wade arrived at the statue of a man, woman and child to the sounds of African drumming and dancers in traditional costume as hundreds of his supporters watched, some waving banners urging him to seek another term in 2012 elections.</p>
<p>He said the monument was for all of Africa. &#8220;It brings to life our common destiny,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Africa has arrived in the 21st century standing tall and more ready than ever to take its destiny into its hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slightly bigger than New York&rsquo;s Statue of Liberty and built by North Korea, the monument perched on a hill overlooking the capital Dakar has been criticized as a waste of money in a country with crumbling infrastructure and welfare provision.</p>
<p>One imam in the mainly Muslim West African state issued a fatwa on Friday condemning the statue as idolatrous, a charge dismissed by Wade&rsquo;s allies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2010, Africa has to be reborn,&#8221; said 36-year-old Thierno Dienj, who was among the crowd at a small anti-government rally on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;But this monument doesn&rsquo;t take into account the rising cost of living here,&#8221; he said, repeating a common complaint about price increases in basic foodstuffs and public transport.</p>
<p>The notion of an &#8220;African Renaissance&#8221; came to the fore in the 1990s amid optimism that the continent was shaking off the effects of colonialism and Cold War-era meddling by superpowers.</p>

		<p>Meddling? I would have called it &#8220;support&#8221;, as all the previously 1st world countries and heading back to the stone age as fast as they can. Rhodesia, has a joke that really sums it up. &#8220;What did we have before candles?&#8221;   &#8220;Electricity&#8221;! South African whites, remember them? The bad guys in every 80 movie and TV show. Now that South Africa is whitey-frey (at least any with their ancestral land) Paradise is the black lot lifted? I think NOT!<br>
RACE MATTERS.</p>

		<p> *This Comment should have been posted under South Africa, but it was too close to dinner to fix it.  &mdash;  - In the spirit of compromise and me continuing to hang out at her paid for 300 acre ranch with no need for a  job, I agreed to clam up with the political AMRen type  comments vis a vis my girlfriend. <br>
  But I had to believe I was making headway at Easter brunch yesterday when her niece, announced that she was leaving to be studying abroad for a semester in&hellip;wait for it&hellip; South Africa!! I watched her across the table chirping away about the particulars. Eighteen American college students and one South African student, sharing a dormitory residence in Capetown for six months. <br>
  We left the brunch and my girl just said over and over again, &#8220;Oh my God! Oh my God!!&#8221; My comment was, &#8220;Two words, Amy Biehl!&#8221; I don`t know what the deal is but my girls  father had also just left for his  own South africa trip. We found out today it was canceled as the cruise ship would not enter Pirate infested waters. When I tacitly questioned the Niece`s father about the wisdom or safety of allowing this tragedy in the making, he admitted he had misgivings but after all, &#8220;Capetown is not Johhanesburg!&#8221; <br>

<p>Inspirational? Maybe. But these people need a whole lot more than just inspiration. </p>
<p>Not only does this represent a colossal waste of money in impoverished Senegal, it&rsquo;s also a colossal waste of money for impoverished North Korea. If Kim Jong-Il really put up $28M for a sculpture to (theoretically) spur Africans to realize their inner greatness and actually start ACHIEVING, then the lonely little man&rsquo;s even nuttier than previously reported. </p>
<p>Statues, sadly, are no substitute for Standard Deviations. So we regret to inform Mr. Kim, Senegal, and the entire Dark Continent, that their &#8220;African Renaissance&#8221; is behind schedule; and will be postponed for&hellip; oh&hellip; about 10,000 years or so. </p>

		<p>I want to mock it, but that is actually quite impressive. The sheer size of it alone is pretty amazing, 28 million dollars seems pretty dirt cheap for a mountain sized monument.</p>
<p>If commies are good at one thing it is propaganda on a grandiose scale. </p>

		<p><i>The notion of an &ldquo;African Renaissance&rdquo; came to the fore in the 1990s amid optimism that the continent was shaking off the effects of colonialism and Cold War-era meddling by superpowers.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny, the farther colonialism recedes into the past, the more decrepit Africa becomes. Odd how that works. And by the way, does ceasing &#8220;meddling&#8221; include withdrawing all monetary foreign aid from Africa?</p>
<p>Actually, the more you delve into the story the funnier and funnier it becomes. </p>
<p>The statue overlooks squatters camps and garbage dumps. </p>
<p>President Wade said of the statue, &ldquo;Africa has arrived in the 21st century standing tall and more ready than ever to take its destiny into its hands.&rdquo; Apparently not, since Senegal had to hire North Koreans to build the statue. </p>
<p>The same company that built the statue builds communist party monuments in North Korea. </p>
<p>Senegal gets about $85 million a year from US taxpayers, and its unveiling corresponds with Senegal getting a $540 million bonus from US taxpayers for &ldquo;good governance!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Since US taxpayers are paying for the statue, it represents a transfer of $28-million from the US to communist North Korea.</p>
<p>The statue represents &#8220;all of Africa,&#8221; and yet Wade plans to charge money to view it (much of it going into his own pocket). From what I&rsquo;ve read, even those using the image of the statue will have to pay royalties to him.</p>
<p>To top it all off, look at the chauvinistic nature of the statue, with a heroic man predominant, a subservient woman gazing up admiringly at his side. </p>
<p>It offends nearly all who view it, including members of Africa&rsquo;s predominant religion of Islam. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that, yes, the statue represents typical African &#8220;good governance.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make stuff like this up.</p>

		<p>I am not sure how this thing is supossed to be inspirational. they are dressed in rags and it looks like the kid is pointing to a Red Cross relief truck, and if this is supposed to represent Africans shouldn&rsquo;t they have tight curley hair and not long flowing locks?</p>

		<p>Oh, why not?  Like throwing money directly at them ever does any good&hellip; They still starve, and murder each other, no matter what anybody does for them.  At least now they have something large and decorative in their landscape.</p>
<p>To me, the facial features and super-hot bodies look like Ukrainian peasants&hellip; although the drapery betrays North Korean fantasies about black men.  And I think the uncharacteristically shapely legs (again, more Ukrainian than African) rising out of the Dolomite is a nice touch, et tres symbolique (youtube &#8216;Mad TV Dolomite&rsquo;: you&rsquo;ll appreciate).</p>

		<p>It will not take a lot of time until we will see Advertise on TV to send money to Senegal. Of course they will not show the picture of this monument but of hungry babies.</p>
<p>Furthermore it is very interesting to goole &#8220;African Renaissance&#8221;. The first link is on of Wikipedia. If you not click on it but only look at the short description on the google page under the link you will read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Africa is for Africans, Africa&rsquo;s problems require African solutions&#8221;.</p>

<p>The statue looks nice but why did they have to hire Koreans? After all race is only a social construst so therefore black Africans should be talented enough to build their own monuments. Right, liberals?</p>

		<p>The &#8220;aid&#8221; given by western countries is really just to bribe the ruling clique into being cooperative with us. It never gets past their sticky fingers. The concern they have for their citizens is nearly zero and this episode highlights that. Also, building a statue is not exactly a high tech endeavor so what does it say about the country when they have to outsource even that? </p>
