			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, April 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Spanish Foreign Ministry confirmed that Mario Zarza Manresa, a doctor who was travelling through the vast Central African nation, had been kidnapped.</p>
<p>Mr Zarza Manresa was seized on April 1 while travelling down the Congo River on a boat that was overrun by rebels.</p>
<p>Congolese Information Minister said that Mr Zarza Manresa had been &#8220;shaved completely by Ibrahim (a rebel leader) who believes in magical fetishes made with hair and body hair of whites&#8221;.</p>
<p>Gunmen from Congo&rsquo;s plethora of rebel and pro-government armed groups often adorn themselves with trinkets or traditional garments before heading into battle, in the belief that they will protect them from the bullets of the enemy.</p>
<p>Some believe wearing fetishes will turn bullets into water.</p>
<p>The Spanish government could not confirm the reports of Mr Zarza Manresa&rsquo;s shaving, but Felix Costales, the country&rsquo;s ambassador in Congo, told Spanish television that fishermen in the area had seen the hostage and he was well.</p>
<p>Mr Zarza Manresa was in Congo as a tourist and not for work.</p>
<p>The Enyele, the ethnic group that the rebels come from, has not previously had any confrontations with Europeans, Mr Costales said.</p>
<p>The incident took place 30 miles north of Mbandaka, the provincial capital which was attacked last weekend.</p>
<p>Government troops backed by United Nations peacekeepers eventually repelled the rebels but the clash marked the fighters apparently expanding their rebellion and underscores Congo&rsquo;s simmering violence, four years after post-war elections.<br>

		<p>Not to minimize this poor man&rsquo;s suffering but I don&rsquo;t know which is more hilarious, his being shaved completely bald (probably all over) or his captors last dying thoughts as their bullet ridden bodies give grim testimony to the ineffectiveness of their &#8220;magic&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absurd situation that most people are completely unaware of.  So absurd, they wouldn&rsquo;t believe it if they were told.</p>

		<p>Why in heavens name would he want to vacation in the Congo?  And since he hasn&rsquo;t been released I wonder what other parts they need for their magic?  If they manage to keep him alive during the dismantling process I fear he is in for a horrible death.</p>
<p>There are places regular people should never visit: Antartica, Detroit, Africa, etc..</p>

		<p>I suspect that the USA government is already rushing to initiate a program to import hundreds of thousands of these poor, needy, misunderstood people into the USA.  Most likely they will be relocated into a small Mid-Western or NE town, in order to &#8220;increse local diversity.&#8221;  Your taxes will go to support them and their progeny, forever.</p>

		<p>I am unsympathetic to Senor Manresa&rsquo;s plight. A man who&rsquo;s been in school long enough to become a medical doctor should at least have the research skills to realize that the congo ain&rsquo;t a vacation hot spot.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s my theory: Most post-colonial Africans have been subjected to the liberal lie that the races are equally intelligent.</p>
<p>This rebel leader wondered why the whites have superior technology even though they&rsquo;re not smarter and came up w/the idea that their hair gives them magic powers.</p>
<p>After all the hair of non-whites only comes in two colors: black when young and gray when old. But our magic hair comes in many different colors and textures.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s stop the food and money shipments and have all white americans just shave their pubes and send them over pronto. The amount of combined magic would probably cure AIDS and send Africa back into its rightful place as the gleaming diamond of all human existence. That mecca of knowledge they claim once taught white people who were savagely playing with their own feces in caves.</p>

		<p>they think it stops bullets because the bullets they shoot at Whites never kill them. What they don&rsquo;t realize is that the reason they get no hits is their poor aim. they have probably never learned how to shoot straight.</p>

<p>Probably that they didn&rsquo;t use enough of the white man&rsquo;s hair!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference between whites and Africans. Whites eventually learn that you can&rsquo;t turn lead into gold, the world is not flat and lightening is not a punishment from God. But the Africans will continue to try to use hair to stop bullets for as long as the largess of foolish whites is diverted to providing munitions for these barbarians.</p>

		<p>I feel I should point out that while ordinary White People Hair will stop regular bullets, there are classes of Special White People Hair fabulously guaranteed to fend off mortar attacks, land mines, and bombs.  Virtually none of those who possess these special colors of hair have ever died as a result of the deployment of these types of weaponry.</p>
<p>I refer to the much-revered group of American Whites known as the &#8216;Blue Hairs&rsquo;. These high priestesses are known to live almost forever.  Now we know their secret: the hair!  Even more magical are those whose tresses are of a lavender tint: the Lilac Wash being the most secret form of magic, and the key to America&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
<p>The horror is that beauty parlors from Ohio to Kansas routinely THROW AWAY these talismanic tresses, when the precious strands could be saving the lives of noble warriors overseas.</p>
<p>I would urge church groups to stop sending money to Africa (It clearly is doing no good&hellip;), and to instead start collecting, baling, and distributing to African soldiers, the most special colors of White People Hair: Blue, Lavender, and (can only be collected once yearly, after certain rivers have magically turned green) Kelly Green.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t appreciate &#8216;Good Hair&rsquo;, until you really need it.&#8221;</p>
