<h1>Seattle Girl, 16, and Three Others Accused of Robbing Several Area Banks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Sullivan and Mike Carter, Seattle Times, March 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Shennell Kennebrew&rsquo;s father recognized his daughter&rsquo;s image in a television news report on the prolific foul-mouthed bank robber dubbed the &#8220;F-Bomb Bandit,&#8221; he urged her to turn herself in, Seattle police said.</p>
<p>But he says the 16-year-old girl laughed at him.</p>
<p>Not long afterward, police, acting on tips from two other people who saw the same news report, arrested Kennebrew at her South Seattle home March 2. Police say she was dressed in a black North Face jacket identical to one worn by the suspect in a Feb. 16 bank robbery in Renton.</p>
<p>By the time Jamel Kennebrew arrived at Seattle police headquarters, his daughter was already being questioned in the string of bank robberies between Jan. 11 and Feb. 24. He told detectives he had confronted the girl only to be rebuffed, according to charging documents filed earlier this week in King County Superior Court.</p>
<p>Shennell Kennebrew and three others, including two other teens, now face charges in connection with four armed robberies in Seattle, Kent and Renton that police said netted just under $11,400.</p>
<p>Kennebrew blamed her actions on her love for her boyfriend, co-defendant Dasha Taylor, the charges allege. She told police that Taylor and his cousin asked her to rob banks, for which she was once rewarded with $25 and a new jacket, charging documents said.</p>
<p>Kennebrew; Taylor, 17, of Renton; and another girl, Jade Beers, 17, of Seattle; have all been charged as adults for their alleged roles in the robberies. The three teens and Keith Sims, a 40-year-old with an extensive state and federal criminal record, have each been charged with four counts of first-degree robbery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Vince Lombardi III, who prosecuted Sims in the 2005 case, said the defendant &#8220;certainly has a long history of having young women commit his crimes while he lurks out in the parking lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>King County prosecutors said Sims is a third-strike offender, who is facing life in prison if convicted on the new bank-robbery charges.</p>

		<p>Ah, home sweet home.  Renton&hellip;.Ahead of the Curve.  Full of degenerate blacks that came here because they heard the white women have no scruples and DSHS dollars flow in the streets like manna from heaven.   </p>
<p>You all would have a great laugh if you could see this place.  They&rsquo;ve spent millions of the tax revenue they enjoy from being host to a Boeing 737 final assembly line trying to spruce up this place, hoping people won&rsquo;t notice that it&rsquo;s still full of degenerate blacks.  </p>
<p>But no one wants to move into the super-overpriced condos they&rsquo;ve built in the city because they&rsquo;re across the street from a Transit Center that vies for the honor of being the most dangerous in the state.  There is a squad car at the Transit Center 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, restaurants are closing down all over town, real estate sits empty, and Boeing?  They&rsquo;ve been selling off land for years.  Now there&rsquo;s a massive shopping mall where there used to be machine shops and parking for all the thousands of employees that don&rsquo;t work for the company anymore.  </p>
<p>And good luck trying to recoup the tax revenue we&rsquo;re going to lose from Boeing moving out from all the welfare blacks shooting and stabbing each other at the Transit Center to show &#8220;who be da baddes.&#8221;  Somehow I don&rsquo;t think bank robbers report their earnings to the IRS.  </p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;d rather have the machine shops and parking lots rather than a half-empty struggling retail behemoth that was built way too late in the game.  Wish they&rsquo;d send the mall to South Carolina instead of the aircraft assembly lines.  </p>

<p>Interesting story. Here is what could happen to the USA:</p>
<p>I think one great advantage the Americans have is their free media. In Germany the private media and the state-owned media have made a contract to not talk about the ethnic or say the name, if this is not important for the crime.</p>
<p>But because only whites can be racist, that means that the media never tell the ethnic or name of immigrant criminals -it can not be a hate crime even if he says &#8220;Die m/f-ing German Nazi&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the other hand the race of all white attacks against immigrants are told in every news, because he could be a racist.</p>
<p>Lefties felt really intelligent with this model. It didn&rsquo;t work anyway because the immigrants were making so much crime and the police wanted some witnesses and therefore had to describe the looking and the color of the criminals. In Hamburg that lead to a great discussion between the lefties and the police and now the police is not allowed to make any description if the criminal is none-white even if this is the only way to get the criminal.</p>
<p>But even that doesn&rsquo;t work because the criminality by immigrants is so high, that in every fourth article there stood &#8220;German&#8221; and in the other three ones there stood nothing. So the reader understood anyway how criminal they are. Now the media even tried the most racist method ever: They changed the name of immigrant criminals to typical white names in their article. But that was not coordinated enough so that some news said that they were immigrants and told their real name: The consequence was that the people wrote extremely angry letters to the news and said they would buy them anymore and only inform theirselves from the internet.<br>
And now everybody knows the truth and read it every day. </p>
<p>What does this all have to do with your story? A mayor of a little city in Austria has already take consequences of this: He and his city are buying every house when a immigrant want to buy it, so they have no immigrants in their city and it is a secure place. I think a very lot of mayors will follow him. They are not blind either and will see what this people has did to other cities.</p>

		<p>When are banks, quickie marts, and other frequently robbed establishments going to install bulletproof-plastic enclosures for their employees?  My husband says banks want to appear open and friendly, and small stores want their one or two clerks to be able to stock as well as run the cash register.  Well, I can tell you that I don&rsquo;t want to walk into any place that&rsquo;s likely to get robbed by gun-toting desperados who would probably as soon start spraying bullets as not.  Fifty years ago, the small city I live near hadn&rsquo;t had a bank robbery for about a century.  Now, it&rsquo;s a common occurrence for small, unguarded branches to be held up.  We&rsquo;re headed for a second Dark Age.</p>

		<p>Bank robbery is one of the dumbest crimes going.  First of all, any bank robbery is instantly federal, so the full resources of the FBI instead of a possibly busy and/or underfunded city police department are involved.  Secondly, in an age of electronic transactions, banks do not keep much cash handy; on a payday Friday, a typical bank MIGHT have as much as $50,000 on site.  What banks ARE full of, though is security cameras, good for providing lots and lots of evidence to prosecutors.  Lastly, the federal prison sentences bank robberies carry today do not allow for parole, since federal parole was abolished in about 1986; you really will be doing almost all of your sentence.  Federal judges do have some latitude in sentencing, though I very much doubt an armed robber who swears like a sailor with Tourette&rsquo;s Syndrome will receive a break.</p>
<p>Enjoy, Shennell!  I hope the $25 and a jacket was worth it.</p>

<p>I live in a small town.  I had moved here from Detroit and was SHOCKED that the banks here don&rsquo;t have bullet-proof glass.  Then again, this area is about 95% white.</p>
<p>For now, at any rate.</p>

In the South, one finds banks with windows and liquor stores (also known as red spots) have bars on the windows. Things like that are in a hilarious book titled &#8220;Thangs Yankees Don&rsquo;t Know&#8221; Besides, I live and travel in the South, so I know Thangs Yankees Don&rsquo;t Know.</p>

He was arrested and when asked why? he said his wife is passed, he was loosing his home and had nowhere to go, was so infirm he couldn&rsquo;t do much so he was gonna let the state take care of him as his taxes had taken care of so many&hellip;((he said rude things here apparently, as it was cut short))</p>

		<p>I love the names Afro-American mothers saddle their children with. Because you don&rsquo;t even need the photo to ID the racial makeup of the criminals.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was involved in employee recruiting. We&rsquo;d see the off-the-wall name on a resume or envelope&hellip; well. Not wishing incriminate the guilty&hellip; I&rsquo;ll let you draw your own conclusions.</p>

		<p>What about the impotent father who &#8220;urged&#8221; his daughter to turn herself in? </p>
<p>Any child of mine would not have had an option. </p>
<p>When did parents get afraid of doing their job? I smell a bellicose, bull moose of a  &#8216;mamma&rsquo; who runs interference for her sweet chile Shennel. Any takers? </p>

		<p>The most offensive part of this whole story is that when told to do right by her father (shocking that she has one), the daughter laughs at him. Such respect&hellip; &#8216;Daddy dear&rsquo; needs to be looking at where this &#8216;foul-mouthed&rsquo; daughter developed such an arrogant, disrespectful attitude and language habit. Such a lovely child that any parent could be proud of.</p>
