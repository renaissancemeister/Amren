			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katherine Donnelly, Irish Independent (Dublin), April 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ALMOST half of teachers in some post-primary schools have recently reported a racist incident, new research reveals.</p>
<p>Rising unemployment has made racism a bigger problem among teenage students, according to the survey.</p>
<p>It is worse in Dublin, in schools with higher numbers of students from migrant backgrounds and in areas suffering high rates of joblessness.</p>
<p>There are more than 48,000 migrant students from over 160 different nationalities in Irish second-level schools/colleges, predominantly in urban areas.</p>
<p>Marketing company Behaviour and Attitudes conducted the research among members of the Teachers&rsquo; Union of Ireland (TUI) on the issue of interculturalism, racism and resources for minority ethnic students.</p>
<p>TUI represents about one-third of second-level teachers, employed in VEC and community and comprehensive schools, as well as lecturers in further-education colleges and institutes of technology.</p>
<p>The post-primary schools in which they teach have a higher proportion of minority ethnic students than those in the voluntary secondary sector, traditionally run by religious groups.</p>
<p>According to the survey, 46pc of teachers in community and comprehensive schools were aware of an incident of racism in the month prior to the survey last year, compared with 40pc of those in VEC schools.</p>
<p>It found the influx of pupils from migrant backgrounds has presented particular challenges for schools, including racist behaviour and intimidation.</p>
<p>African children were perceived to be subjected to more incidents. Racist incidents also occur between different nationalities, particularly in schools with large populations of minority ethnic pupils, with examples of eastern European children taunting African/Indian/Pakistani children.</p>
<p><b>Devastating</b></p>
<p>One-in-three teachers reported that their schools did not have a policy to deal with racism.</p>
<p>TUI deputy general secretary Annette Dolan warned of the impact of education cuts on schools. She said that key middle management posts played a vital role in promoting interculturalism and that the ongoing block on appointments to these positions would have devastating effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the various cutbacks inflicted on the education sector have had a severe impact on all students, minority ethnic students have been disproportionately hit by government cutbacks,&#8221; Ms Dolan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, specific supports for these students have been asset stripped in the Government&rsquo;s slash-and-burn approach to education over the past 18 months.&#8221;<br>

<p>  Yes it is always the evil White people&rsquo;s fault. I have seen countless Eastern Europeans being bullied by surly Asian gangs in England. I personally know many liberals who hate the migration from Eastern Europe and would rather have more Africans, Middle Easterners and South Asians instead.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Diversity not working out in Ireland&rsquo;s schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diversity and multiculturalism are against basic human nature in every race.  It is completely unnatural to accept alien creatures into one&rsquo;s own familiar homogeneous environment.</p>
<p>Force and threat of force, or 24/7 propaganda, is necessary to keep people from killing each other in a multicultural, multiracial society, but neither will prevent out of control chaos for very long.  The first occurence of a serious societal calamity, people will revert to homogeneity and turn on those not like themselves.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.  The Balkins are an excellent example of this and the US and the rest of the West is, right this minute, involved in an implosion of sorts that threatens to get out of control any day now.</p>
<p>Soon, the entire West will have fighting in the streets due, basically, to multiculturalism and diversity in societies that no longer hang together during tough economic times as homogeneous ones would do. <br>

		<p>Ireland had a brief period of prosperity in which they allowed non-white immigration.  Now that that has passed, the immigrants must go.</p>
<p>The Teacher&rsquo;s Union wants to prevail in the ideological struggle to &#8220;promote interculturalism&#8221;.  It is a war they must lose.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good to see the East European kiddies are siding with the Irish. After all, a lot of them have Celtic forebears. It&rsquo;s also good to see that the Irish government&rsquo;s slash and burn policy includes cuts to services to the third world immigrants. The Irish are an inspired people with a great genius in many areas, including a capacity to survive in the face of encroachment and invasion. They also know how to fight back and to identify their enemies. Though they are a loving people, they are not self-delusional. </p>
<p>Of course the writer of this article is typical of her ilk, where she observes, &#8220;It is worse in Dublin, in schools with higher numbers of students from migrant backgrounds and in areas suffering high rates of joblessness.&#8221; It is astounding that the self-styled &#8216;elites&rsquo; cannot make the connection between migration and high unemployment. Instead, they simply repeat their ridiculous mantra that third world migrants are essential to fill jobs, especially jobs the natives won&rsquo;t do. Even if there were a hint of truth in this nonsense, it is given the lie when these people see they fall back on the welfare state-even the Irish are still too silly to apply their slash and burn economies to their third world &#8216;labour force&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>This past summer I drove an elderly Irish Catholic nun-born and raised in Ireland-back to the convent after a family party. The whole ride back she complained bitterly about all the africans flooding into Ireland taking over the cities. I didn&rsquo;t start this conversation. She just started talking five minutes into the ride.<br>

		<p>Over and over again we see that wherever diversity is imposed people don&rsquo;t like it.  But liberals treat it like cod liver oil   &mdash;   if we hate the stuff it must be good for us.</p>
<p>Clearly the anti-black racism in Ireland is based upon their past history  of black slavery.  Oh, wait&hellip;<br>

Just as I&rsquo;ve said, it&rsquo;s not ignorance that leads to &#8216;racism&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>I know this from personal experience. The more experience I have with non-whites, the more racially aware I become.</p>

		<p>The Irish have a soft spot for people fleeing persecution and starvation. Because of famine and British oppression they had to leave Ireland in great numbers, It wasn&rsquo;t Pakistan or Uganda or China that took them in. The U.K. Canada, Australia and especially the U.S. were the countries of destination. I&rsquo;m afraid Dublin will soon become another London. Less pubs and more mosques.</p>

		<p>Until recent times Ireland never had any significant ethnic minorities (if you don&rsquo;t count religious sectarianism as an &#8216;ethnic division&rsquo;), and therefore it never had &#8216;ethnic tensions&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Greg Deane makes a good and often overlooked point.<br>
The &#8216;Celtic people&rsquo; were first known in antiquity and archaeological evidence confirms this, in central and eastern Europe, the migration to nations we call &#8216;celtic&rsquo; today was a later development in their history.</p>

True story:<br>
I have a cousin. This cousin is a communist who hates white privilege, loves Stalin and Lenin, and thought all people are the same. Then he went for one year to Belgium (Belgium is one of the most &#8220;enriched&#8221; countries in Europe). When he came back, he was still a communist and thought all people are the same - with one exception: Blacks!<br>
Because I was a liberal on my own I said that all people must be the same, and he just answered: &#8220;Because you haven&rsquo;t seen them, they are like animals&#8221;.</p>

READ THIS: British National Party  &mdash;  Blog  &mdash;  Tags  &mdash;  Kevin-myers - 01:29Britain Is Being Colonised, Warns Leading Anglo-Irish Journalist.

<p>Kevin Myers, a regular contributor to that paper and sometimes correspondent for many other national papers, wrote in an article published on January 2 this year that &ldquo;(H)uge areas of Britain have become foreign colonies. That could be tomorrow&rsquo;s Ireland, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely the original &#8220;Independant&#8221; based article seems to have vanished from Google. No doubt the racist witch hunters  busy at work again. I also found this: Kevin Myers &hellip;.. It&rsquo;s funny how these so called journalists pick and choose some parts of history &hellip;.. protecting their country that is why our country was never colonized. &hellip;.. Ireland was a colony to Britain for 800 years – far longer than Ethiopia. &hellip;<br>

		<p>to #9:  When I told a black/white liberal I didn&rsquo;t like being around blacks (as a race, not as an individual), they accused me of being ignorant.  When I gave examples of why and stated my reasons, then I was biased and stupid.   So basically we&rsquo;re stupid and ignorant for being pro-white and for being uncomfortable walking in a black neighborhood in the middle of the night.  Nothing you say or do will satisfy white liberals or their racist blacks they claim to support.</p>

<p>Specifically she mentioned africans and nonwhites. She was very upset and fearfull that Ireland would no longer exist in the future. She had no illusions about Christian charity and mercy. It was pure gut level anger,rage and disgust that the Irish could end up becomming a racial minority in Ireland.</p>
<p>If Liberals and leftists were forced to live among nonwhites-Newark for example-for a few years,, I claim with 100 percent certainty that they would come out as hardcore &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Where does Leftist Alexander Cockburn live? In a very rural completetly White community in Northern California. Where does Noam Chomsky live? In a wealthy lilly white neighborhod.</p>

<p>How right you are.  Diversity seems so wonderful to many when times are good and money and goods flow to all.  When an economy collapses, everyone looks out for their own first and fighting erupts along racial, cultural lines.  This has been a constant in human history from earliest recorded memory.  Why don&rsquo;t otherwise educated liberals ever consider the bigger picture?</p>

		<p>The elites in all the western countries seem to have been of one mind in undermining their own nations. May have been good for their bottom line but it also wrecked the various countries to one degree or another. Shows you what happens when people whose highest value in life is greed for money, combined with the religion of multi-culture, happen to be in charge. </p>

		<p>To poster 14.  I once worked in a school that was 70% latino and 30% black.  Most of the latinos were okay, but a few were gangbangers.  The afroamerican students, however, were all candidates for the looney bin.  No self discipline or care for rules whatsoever.</p>
<p>We had a lot of liberal young teachers there.  Social justice, diversity and all that.  One of them was a reading specialist.  She was Mexican American, raised here in an obviously comfortable suburb.  Very educated, well spoken, etc.  A very impressive young lady who was thoroughly Americanized.</p>
<p>I remember this clear as day, about 6 months into the school years, she was in the teachers&rsquo; lounge, practically in tears, fretting over how her always negative interactions with the black students were turning her into a racist.  She related one complaint about them after another and was clearly shaken that her core beliefs should be challenged so. She lamented that they just didn&rsquo;t seem to care about their educations or futures and only wanted to cause trouble and such.  (I was listening intently.)  Needless to say, she did not return the next year.</p>

<p>I propose a very simple solution: Halt all non-white immigration and encourage non-whites already in Ireland and other European countries to leave. After all, you can&rsquo;t have racism without racial diversity. </p>
