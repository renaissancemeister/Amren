<h1>Suit Accuses Census Bureau of Hiring Bias</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nathan Koppel, Wall Street Journal, April 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Census Bureau was accused in a lawsuit filed Tuesday of systematically discriminating against minorities in its 2010 census hiring campaign.</p>
<p>In the suit, job applicants claimed the Census Bureau was unlawfully screening out minorities by requiring all applicants to provide court documents related to an arrest, whether or not it resulted in a conviction.</p>
<p>That requirement has illegally deterred many blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans from applying for jobs, according to the complaint, which said these groups are arrested and convicted at rates that &#8220;far exceed&#8221; those for whites.</p>
<p>It also claimed the Census Bureau improperly excluded job applicants who had been convicted of minor offenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government hired 48,000 temporary census works in March, about one-third of all the new jobs added last month nationwide, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The government is expected to hire hundreds of thousands more census workers in the coming months.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau didn&rsquo;t return calls for comment. In an earlier interview regarding the bureau&rsquo;s hiring plans, a spokeswoman said, &#8220;We will disqualify anyone with prior convictions or pending charges for certain categories, including murder, sex offenses, robbery, voter fraud, or other crimes that suggest a threat to safety or the integrity of census data.&#8221; Applicants with criminal records, she added, won&rsquo;t automatically be disqualified if they can &#8220;conclusively demonstrate that they do not present a current threat.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit was filed by New York law firm Outten &amp; Golden LLP and seven public-interest organizations on behalf of two job applicants to the 2010 census. The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in New York City, seeks class-action status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hiring for the 2010 census comes as cash-strapped states across the country release thousands of prisoners to trim ballooning prison budgets. The newly freed individuals have struggled to find work in one of the worst economies in decades.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m working this 2010 census as an enumerator. There was a White fellow in my GQE (Group Quarters Enumeration  &mdash;  rest homes, dorms, jails, DDA group homes, etc.) training group that used to be a deputy sheriff in a jurisdiction 400 miles away in another state. On the second day of a three day training session he was yanked out for further scrutiny because of his law enforcement background. None of the supervisors will talk about him any more. </p>
<p>Go figure.</p>

		<p>Well, what are you gonna do about it, white man?</p>
<p>Many years ago I encountered racial discrimination against whites in the Federal Government.  Racial discrimination was outlawed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, so I guessed it would be easy to find a lawyer who would set things right in court, especially since law suits against &#8220;racial discrimination&#8221; were frequently in the news at the time.  I qickly learned &#8220;racial discrimination&#8221; applied only to blacks, not to white males.  It was not a matter of principle, or the rule of law, as I had thought, but simply favoritism and a naked grab by one race.  I spent an entire day going through the yellow pages and calling most of the lawyers in the book.  Not one was interested in my case, and several told me point blank they would not take any case that could be perceived as &#8220;anti-black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it got worse.  When the Social Security Administration fired me for &#8220;disrespect&#8221; the Administrative Law Judge at the hearing notified me that truth was no defense and I could not make a claim of racial discrimination because I was a white male and white males were not classified as a &#8220;protected group&#8221; and only members of protected groups were &#8220;protected&#8221; against racial discrimination.</p>
<p><br>
So here&rsquo;s what you can do, white man; call your Congressman or Senator.  Tell him what you just read about &#8220;protected groups.&#8221;  Tell him the Constitution guarantees equal protection of the laws to all citizens of the United States, and you want a stop put to racial discrimination against white males now.</p>
<p>I told my Congressman.  He forbade me to speak to anyone in his office and ignored my written questions.  But not all Congressmen are shameless.  Maybe you can find an honest one.</p>
<p>The point is that here is a blatant, flagrant injustice that can be attacked.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>

		<p>What arrant nonsense!  I applied for a Census job (I&rsquo;m white and almost 65) - and I was the only white person in the room.  I have not been hired and my guess is I probably won&rsquo;t be, because I&rsquo;m not a minority.  Several of my white friends have had the same experience.  Bias against minorities my posterior - that&rsquo;s all the Census Bureau hires out here in CA.</p>

		<p>Census Bureau interviews are confidential, so that respondents will feel safe answering questions.  The respondents need to know that the interviewer isn&rsquo;t a potential criminal.  Like the one who asked if she was wearing pink underwear?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a White man and I was hired by the census, but I got 100% on the test.  They need some capable people to train and oversee the clods who are hired as enumerators.  </p>

El Cerotito, I was hired as enumerator and I&rsquo;m white.  You pretty much have to score 100% on the test they give.  You can take the test multiple times.  You can check how you did about a week after you take the test.  Do this and if you got lower than 100%, take the test again, and again, and again, until you get 100%.</p>
<p>Also, under languages spoken, say that you can speak, read &amp; write Spanish even if you don&rsquo;t.  They don&rsquo;t test to see if you can actually speak &amp; read it.  Or at least they didn&rsquo;t with me.  But if practice a few spanish phrases in case they do.  &#8220;Like, I&rsquo;m with the Census&#8221;, etc</p>

		<p>Picking up on some of the comments:</p>
<p>The law enforcement guy was yanked because he was perceived as not willing to commit fraud during the census, and more likely would REPORT it as a crime.<br>
The white guy will probably not be hired for the same reason.</p>
<p>The census takers are overwhelmingly minority.  It is likely Mein Obama has put out the word that it should be so.  His stacked deck will take the role of ACORN as to inflating the numbers of minorities, and injecting fraudulent counts.  The goal is to redistrict so that minorities have more clout during elections, get more federal money, and justify grabbing more of our money to redistribute to illegal aliens and minorities for social services.  So yeah.  Honest folks not wanted.  Minorities with a vested interest are.</p>

		<p>Hey, friends, I DID get 100% on the test.  But I can&rsquo;t go out in the field as I&rsquo;m handicapped by arthritis, so I would have to do office work.  As a former legal secy and paralegal, I think I could handle their stuff.  But they have definitely not called.  I&rsquo;m not exactly waiting on pins and needles, you know, but I probably would take the job if it was offered.  Oyes, and I DO speak Spanish&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I did reasonably well on the test, and my raw score in combination with my veteran&rsquo;s preference points put me over 100%.</p>
<p>I was called last year but was unavailable at the time.  I was told that my name would be kept for 2010.  I&rsquo;ve checked twice with my area census office in the past few months.  Both times I&rsquo;ve been told that my name and score are still in their records and that I should &#8220;be patient.&#8221;  As a white male who&rsquo;s been the victim of &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; on numerous occasions, I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p>

		<p>I got 28 out of 29 questions right on the enumerator test back in January and got a call about a month ago that I would be starting training late this month. So far, so good, but it will be interesting to see how this plays out, like obviously underqualified minorities being kept on after the enumerator field work is done.</p>
<p>I was also told I was on their &#8220;priority list&#8221; (or something like that) because of my high test score, but it&rsquo;s funny that it&rsquo;s taking them so long to put me to work after the test (3+ months) if I&rsquo;m really that favored.</p>
<p>FYI, most of the people taking the enumerator test where I went (Brevard County, Florida) were white.</p>

		<p>I took the test and applied in 1980.  I got a letter saying something like Congratualations you have passed with a score of 100%.  Unfortunately we will not be able to hire you at this time because of &#8220;Judicial constraints.&#8221;</p>
<p>I really need the extra pay of a part time job at the time.  So I called their number and asked what&rsquo;s a Judicial constraint?  The older White man replied.  &#8220;We&rsquo;re under strict orders to hire only certain races and you&rsquo;re not one of them.&#8221;</p>
