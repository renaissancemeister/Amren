<h1><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/04/29/border-states-dealing-illegal-immigrant-crime-data-suggests/">Border States Deal With More Illegal Immigrant Crime Than Most, Data Suggest</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, April 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona lawmakers say their new immigration enforcement law will help them fight an illegal immigrant crime wave that is sweeping the state, a claim that is backed by studies and statistics that suggest border states have a disproportionately high number of criminals who are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been inundated with criminal activity. It&rsquo;s just  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s been outrageous,&#8221; Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer told Fox News.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crime is off the chart in this state,&#8221; added Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, president of the Arizona Association of Sheriffs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the correlation between illegal immigrants and crime is almost impossible to quantify precisely, the available numbers indicate that Arizona  &mdash;  as well as California and Texas  &mdash;  are dealing with increased crime as a result of high illegal immigrant populations and activity.</p>
<p>Part of this is because some of those immigrants are being arrested based on immigration-related charges. {snip}</p>
<p>But there are other crimes, many of which are drug-related. Furthermore, illegal immigrants and smuggling organizations have been linked to some specific violent crimes in Arizona. {snip}</p>
<p>The report also showed that assaults against U.S. law enforcement on the southwestern border are on the rise. The report found that the number of attacks on Border Patrol agents increased 46 percent to 1,097 incidents in fiscal 2008. The report said the assaults were mostly related to immigrant smuggling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other states with high illegal immigrant populations  &mdash;  like Illinois  &mdash;  do not have a lot of illegal immigrant prisoners. Federal statistics show the illegal immigrant population is actually underrepresented in Illinois prisons.</p>
<p>But a comprehensive study released late last year from the Center for Immigration Studies cited federal law enforcement data showing that illegal immigrants made up a disproportionate share of the state prison populations in California and Arizona.</p>
<p>In 2004, the year when the data was most recently available, 12.4 percent of California prisoners were illegal immigrants, as compared with an estimated 6.9 percent of the state population. In Arizona, 11.1 percent of the prison population was undocumented, compared with 7 percent of the overall state population. In Texas, the percentage was also slightly higher in the prisons than it was statewide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But overall, it&rsquo;s hard to say that illegal immigrants have triggered a crime explosion in any of these states, though the recent killing of Arizona rancher Robert Krentz by a suspected illegal immigrant has served as a rallying cry for advocates of tougher enforcement.</p>
<p>FBI statistics show California and Texas had a violent crime average slightly higher than the national average 2008, while Arizona&rsquo;s average was slightly lower.</p>
<p>Jessica Vaughan, a co-author of the Center for Immigration Studies report and policy director at the think tank, said the bottom line is that connections between illegal immigrants and crime are hard to draw.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t find any evidence to support the idea that either immigrants are more prone to crime or less prone to crime than .&nbsp;.&nsbp;. legally resident Americans,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very tricky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vaughan said part of the problem is that no federal database keeps a dependable count of how many illegal immigrants are convicted of crimes. Federal prison data, for instance, breaks out non-citizens in its data, but that covers several groups and not just illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do keep track, though, and with the data that is available, Vaughan said it&rsquo;s apparent that there is a connection between illegal immigrants and certain types of crimes, like drug trafficking and identify theft. And, she said, illegal immigrants have a tendency toward recidivism.</p>

		<p>The border states are being somewhat disengenous here.  What they are doing (quite successfully I think) is forcing states not on the border to deal with the problems that they have for so long.  The goal here is to create widespread discontent among the states to force a federal response.  States not on the border have been all too willing to ignore the issue as long as it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal in their state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about to end.</p>

<p>Once again we see just how difficult it is for some to use &#8216;illegal&rsquo; when illegal is the core of the issue. It is some mental block that these people just can not grasp nor wish to acknowledge. To me, this is an insult to all that have gone through or are going through the process l-e-g-a-l-l-y.</p>
<p>The only thing that is &#8216;tricky&rsquo; is how to get a grasp on the amount of crime from their little &#8216;English learner&rsquo; aka drop-babies, that are completely failing to assimilate. We are so deep into this mess that just saying or calling someone an American citizen is such a horrific stretch in most cases. The statistics are muddled to say the least. </p>
<p>If any of these enriching folks turn out to be citizens, where do you believe their allegiances to be?</p>

<p>#1 No doubt this is forcing the other states to take action. While the other states appear to have been quiet on this problem - it has been a big deal. Tennessee, Georgia, Florida &amp; Oregon ( just to name a few ) I know have had a huge burden placed upon them through problems with gangs &amp; general sapping of resources. </p>
<p>I believe we are seeing the tip of the iceberg &amp; I hope she is very very cold&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. <br>

		<p>Right, because we know lots of young, conservative white males are gangbanging, getting arrested, sleeping around, doing drugs, and dropping out of school at high rates.  </p>

<p>Of course they didn&rsquo;t find any &#8220;evidence&#8221;, they&rsquo;ll make sure of that. I live in a sanctuary city in Texas and over the last 20 years, we have had a lot more crime and gangs as well as traffic accidents not to mention illegals sucking the life&rsquo;s blood out of our welfare system, hospitals and schools. So I know from personal experience that yes, having mass illegal immigration as well as some types of legal immigration has led to more crime.</p>

		<p>We moved to Wisconsin in 1999.  One of the reasons was very little crime, and the demographics.  Since then, we&rsquo;ve had Katrina and our liberal Governor brought in 5000 Katrina blacks to the Captiol city.  The mayor, another liberal, designated Madison (the capitol) as a sanctuary city.  You know what resulted of course.  We now have multiple murders every year between 50 and 100 in the Madison area where before it was one or two per year.  We have break-ins, bank robbery, drugs, gangs, drive by shootings, many more drunk driving fatalities, etc.  And, like other stupid liberal States, we are quickly becoming bankrupt while advocating for Obamacare.  We are cutting police services due to funding deficits, but we&rsquo;d NEVER want to deny social services to illegal aliens, or admit what a drain they are on our economy, prisons, communities, and loss of jobs to REAL Wisconsin citizens.</p>

<p>Could the reason be that most crime data lumps &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; in with &#8220;White&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Speaking of the border states, we are unfortunate enough to have a bunch of open borders fanatics with the exception of one courageous woman who started what I hope will spread to every state in the union. We know that California has gladly surrendered to Mexico. And has anyone noticed how Bill Richardson in NM looks more &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; all the time? Our own governor her in Texas, Little Ricky, isn&rsquo;t going to do a thing. Election time is over and he can stop pretending that he wants the border enforced. How can we get so lucky as to have people in office, especially here in the border states, who shamelessly pander to Mexico and all the other countries who laugh at or laws? They&rsquo;re looking out for big business who wants cheap labor and who will ensure that they can stay in office and can belly up to the public trough as long as they can.</p>

I have seen pictures of these &#8220;whites&#8221; and they couldn&rsquo;t pass for white in a Latin American country with a much broader definition of white than we have!</p>
