<h1><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ap2TZkCU0SSg">Mexico Issues Travel Warning for Arizona Over Law</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan J. Levin and Catherine Dodge, Bloomberg, April 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexicans in Arizona should carry documentation and &#8220;act carefully&#8221; after the state passed a law requiring local police to determine the immigration status of anyone suspected of being in the country illegally, Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said.</p>
<p>The ministry said the warning is directed toward Mexicans living, studying or planning to travel to the southwestern U.S. state, which shares a border with northern Mexico, according to the e-mailed statement sent today. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an adverse political environment for migrant communities and all Mexican visitors,&#8221; Mexico&rsquo;s ministry said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s important to act carefully and respect the local laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Murderous Greed&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of drug cartels,&#8221; Brewer said. &#8220;We cannot delay while the destruction happening south of our international border creeps its way north.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law, which goes into effect 90 days after the Arizona legislative session ends, states that police must investigate if they have &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that someone is undocumented, according to Gabriel Chin, a professor of Law and Public Policy at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Police officers may face lawsuits if they fail to do so, he added.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Angered and Saddened&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very hard for me to see how this law can be enforced without discrimination,&#8221; Chin said in a telephone interview today from Tucson. &#8220;It seems to be inevitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexican President Felipe Calderon said April 26 that his country&rsquo;s citizens are &#8220;angered and saddened&#8221; by the Arizona law, which he said &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t adequately guarantee respect for people&rsquo;s fundamental rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>About a quarter of Arizona&rsquo;s 6.6 million residents are of Hispanic descent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

		<p>What the Mexican President should have been quoted as saying is:</p>
<p>Mexican President Felipe Calderon said April 26 that his country doesn&rsquo;t adequately guarantee respect for people&rsquo;s fundamental rights.</p>
<p>That is the real problem.  Mexico is a corrupt, incredibly racists apartheid country with no love of its people what so ever.<br>

		<p>Mexico warning its citizens to be careful in the US, specifically Arizona, is hilarious. We can promise you, Senor Calderon that they won&rsquo;t be murdered, rapped, robbed, or molested like Americans might be in Mexico. If asking for identification when something suspicious is noted, like all airlines do and police do when they stop anyone for a traffic infraction or any other sign of a crime being committed, is certainly better than having our people murdered. I&rsquo;m sure the Krentz family would agree with this. By the way, I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone from Mexico apologize for the invasion of our country or try to stop it or even mention the many Americans who&rsquo;ve suffered at the hands of their illegal aliens. How about a blanket apology for all the money spent while seeing our nation descend into third world status? Better still, rather than warning your people, how about just taking them all home and keeping them there. It IS you job, after all.</p>

		<p>Mexican President is saddened and angered, what does he think about the citizens of this country that have family fighting in revolutionary war and every war for this country. We are saddened and angry to, my nephew is fighting in Iraq right now and I worry about his safety and mental health every day. I wonder if its worth him being over there.</p>

		<p>The Mexican president should really think about cleaning up his own country before talking about his neighbors to the north. </p>
<p>I would much rather be caught undocumented in Arazona than in Mexico. What do they do if the catch you undocumented in Arazona, they send you back to Mexico, back to that wonderful country where the president is so worried about you, is that really so bad?</p>

		<p>Mexico does not &ldquo;adequately guarantee respect for people&rsquo;s fundamental rights&rdquo; for any of its own citizens. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re fleeing the third world hellhole they&rsquo;ve created and coming over here. And yet, mexico expects us to do what they choose not to do? </p>

<p>Maybe they should have thought about that 25 or 30 years ago; or even three days ago, before hundreds of these &ldquo;Mexican visitors&rdquo; invaded our country as a &ldquo;right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Respect our &ldquo;laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How laughable, indeed; what &ldquo;laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are &ldquo;tolerantly&rdquo; remaking this country into Mexico: a lawless land of random violence and &ldquo;proud&rdquo; poverty.</p>

<p>Yes, and it goes somethng like, &#8220;When you are sneaking into Gringoland via our favorite route, Arizona, be careful that you have forged enough documents to fool the police there.&#8221;</p>
<p>And be sure to send all your earnings back to our latin paradise so we can add that to our drug money in order that our beautiful, bountiful Mexican homeland can keep operating with the same narco crowd in charge.  You know, the ones that pocket all the revenue instead of investing in our businesses which causes you to have to sneak into another country with your hand out begging for freebies.</p>
<p>And, while you&rsquo;re there, if you can&rsquo;t run down the middle of the street with our flag high overhead, at least pin it to the wall somewhere to show your dedication and patriotism to the fatherland, which looks out for you.</p>

		<p>I am ecstatic over the great work that AZ has done for their state and for our country!!  Now CA, NM, and TX need to get off their duffs and pass identical legislation.  It&rsquo;s simply enforcing the laws that are already on the books - that the libs have been ignoring since Reagan (one of his few mistakes) granted amnesty back in &#8216;86 or so.  Time for REAL enforcement.  And anybody who doesn&rsquo;t like it can leave the U.S. and go home, and make Mexico into a better country than it is now.  That won&rsquo;t take much effort - it can&rsquo;t get much worse.  I do hope they hire mercenaries to take care of the drug cartels, however.  I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any such thing as a Mexican Army - or if there is, they&rsquo;re outnumbered and outgunned.</p>

		<p>Mexico has a single, streamlined law that ensures that foreign visitors and immigrants are:</p>
<p> -in the country legally;<br>
 -have the means to sustain themselves economically;<br>
 -not destined to be burdens on society;<br>
 -of economic and social benefit to society;<br>
 -of good character and have no criminal records; and<br>
 -contributors to the general well-being of the nation.<br>
The law also ensures that:</p>
<p> -immigration authorities have a record of each foreign visitor;<br>
 -foreign visitors do not violate their visa status;<br>
 -foreign visitors are banned from interfering in the country&rsquo;s internal politics;<br>
 -foreign visitors who enter under false pretenses are imprisoned or deported;<br>
 -foreign visitors violating the terms of their entry are imprisoned or deported;<br>
 -those who aid in illegal immigration will be sent to prison.</p>
