<h1><a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-47528720100408">They Walk Among Us: 1 in 5 Believe in Aliens  &mdash;  Survey</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, April 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Reuters Ipsos poll of 23,000 adults in 22 countries showed that more than 40 percent of people from India and China believe that aliens walk among us disguised as humans, while those least likely to believe in this are from Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands (8 percent each).</p>
<p>However, the majority of people polled, or 80 percent, don&rsquo;t believe aliens in our midst.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the it&rsquo;s a simple case that in a less populated country you are more likely to know your next door neighbour better,&#8221; [John Wright, Senior Vice President of market research firm Ipsos] said.</p>

		<p>Wright is a moron or a liar.  Belgium and the Netherlands are roughly as densely populated as India (slightly less and slightly more, respectively), and both are almost 3 times as densely populated as China.</p>

		<p>John Wright has certainly given a specious explanation, which doesn&rsquo;t even hold up in its own context. The Netherlands and Belgium are just as densely populated as India and China; and because of governments that have enriched the lives of Dutch and Belgians, more likely to avoid their neighbours in all their diverse forms.</p>
<p>The real reason that people from India and China believe in aliens is because of superstition, ignorance and poor ability to make rational inquiries. These are the factors that cause these countries to remain impoverished on a per capita basis, where the average Indian or Chinese still has an income equal to one fifth to one tenth of that of an average European. </p>
<p>Of course, Europeans are quite right to believe aliens who are hostile to our culture, customs, history, moral codes and laws   do walk among us. Many of them come from India and China, not from spaceships; others look more like us, but are in fact self-described as liberals and progressives. </p>

		<p>Astronomers say that there are over 170,000,000,000 galaxies in the observable universe. Each galaxy contains as few as 10,000,000 stars to as much as 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) stars. The chances that other intelligent life exists in the universe are astronomically high, so high, in fact, that if merely a few hundred intellient alien civilizations existed in each galaxy there would be trillions, if not quadrillions, of them. But I&rsquo;ll bet that the universe if full of life, and there are decillions of decillions of alien civilizations that have existed, exist now and will exist in the future.</p>
<p>Of course I believe in aliens. As I said, the chances of other intelligent life existing are extremely high. But do I believe aliens walk among us on our planet disguised as humans? No, absolutely not. There would be no reason for them to do so; it would be completely pointless.</p>
<p>This type of thinking reminds me about Africans&rsquo; superstitious beliefs in magic. I can&rsquo;t believe people would still subscribe to superstitious thinking in today&rsquo;s modern world.</p>

<p>All that stuff that goes bump in the night?  It&rsquo;s the doings of human beings.  Don&rsquo;t let the Art Bells and George Noorys of the world insult your intelligence, when they parade guest after guest on their show night after night telling you that they&rsquo;re telling you &#8220;what the government doesn&rsquo;t want you to know.&#8221;  On 500+ radio stations, all of them FCC licensed?  Get real.  Be white and talk about race in anything less than a PC way, and you&rsquo;ll find out what it&rsquo;s like when a government (or some other powerful entity) doesn&rsquo;t want you to know something.  </p>
<p>The Roswell thing?  The Pentagon admitted a few years ago that it wasn&rsquo;t a weather balloon or something from the Great Expanse.  They were spying on the Soviet Union and its nuclear ambitions, in violation of a number of treaties, and in a time when the cold war was heating up.  They&rsquo;re the ones that peddled the &#8220;alien&#8221; story, and also the &#8220;weather balloon&#8221; retort in a good cop bad cop hat dance, and laughed like a cat with a cheshire grin when the Art Bells of the world ran with it in that way.  </p>

		<p>A few years ago this was laughable, but now with the coming to light of a lot of formerly classified info on this subject, it isn&rsquo;t so far-fetched after all.  Some extremely intelligent people wholeheartedly believe in this, and there is certainly evidence that, while not conclusive, is simply inexplicable.  I don&rsquo;t know what to think.  I am open to the possibility, I suppose, but I very much hope it isn&rsquo;t so.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion that there are other intelligent lifeforms besides ourselves in this universe or others. On one hand, I certainly can&rsquo;t blame folks for being skeptical; one is more likely to believe what some political talking head is saying than some noone from nowhere that claims to have experienced something extraordinary. I can tell you, however, that once you&rsquo;ve seen something for yourself, it can certainly change the way you view this subject as well as others.</p>
<p>Now, do I believe that they walk amongst us? Not so much. Do I believe that they abduct people on a regular basis and perform bizarre medical experiments? Why in the hell would they? If they are truly as advanced as some assume they are, then they&rsquo;d be able to learn everything they needed to about us from a single strand of DNA. The visitations, abductions and other supposed violent encounters rarely, if ever, hold much water.</p>
<p>Question Diversity:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a long time AmRenner and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed your input, but your response to this is at odds with what I&rsquo;ve heard you say before. You mention that the Pentagon &#8220;admitted&#8221; such-and-such. Do you honestly believe everything the government tells you? Your previous posts lead me to believe that you don&rsquo;t. Why is this case any different?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what this has to do with the usual topics of American Renaissance.  After all, just among white Americans you will find an enormous diversity of views on UFOs, aliens, ghosts, reincarnation, biblical inerrancy, or, for that matter, how to explain (or explain away) the nonlocal nature of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I have never experienced any sort of uncanny phenomena, and, like most people in my situation, am very skeptical of all this stuff (except that Bell&rsquo;s inequalities have been experimentally confirmed, so I&rsquo;m stuck with that mind fracturing fact).  But I know of some smart, educated, and sane people who have had experiences that are really hard explain within the confines of consensual reality.  I don&rsquo;t know what to make of such reports.  It&rsquo;s a weird world, with even weirder people in it, and a lot of them are white.</p>

<p>If aliens exist, it is possible they are here studying us&hellip; I think you have your numbers backwards. There are billions of stars in our own Milky Way Galaxy, but there have not been 170 billion other galaxies discovered? I would guess the odds of a planet having exactly the conditions of Earth to be around 1 billion to 1. Still, the odds are that some might exist in our Galaxy alone. It seems silly to assume life would have to spring from exactly Earth like conditions, would have to be formed very similar to us, too?  </p>

		<p>   I try to remain open to both the possibility that we are alone and that there may be others . But I must have tangible proof, apparently it&rsquo;s not there . Roswell ? I find it more believable that our government would send up primates or even technicians against their will to discover the effects of space, re-entry, decompression, recompression etc . If some of the people of Roswell did actually see alien-like bodies . Or perhaps it was accident victims from the early reactors . But one thing is for certain, every town or region needs it&rsquo;s own Roswell or Nessie as it translates into cold, hard tourist dollars . Once upon a time, most Americans would not have lied, not even for money .</p>

		<p>I certainly believe we&rsquo;ve been invaded by aliens. They generally have dark skin pigmentation. Don&rsquo;t speak English (human language) overly well. Preferring to communicate amongst themselves with a language composed more of clicks and grunts. Eschew human activity like work. Enjoy destruction of property for its own sweet sake. Most notable features being a propensity for criminal activity. Fathering multiple offspring but displaying no interest in their future care or upbringing. Artistic ability being confined to listening to strange grunting chanting noise, punctuated with drums and cacophonous &#8216;music&rsquo; produced instruments of various kinds.</p>

		<p>I am certainly inclined to believe in the possibility of other life elsewhere in the universe; the sheer number of other planets and galaxies is really incomprehensible.  However, believing in the possibility of intelligent life and thinking aliens walk among us is two entirely different things.</p>
<p>On a side note, ever noticed how people who usually believe crazy stuff like this are the first to denounce how stupid religion is?  I always find that gap in logic quite ridiculous considering the lack of evidence supporting such a thought.</p>

<p>In regards to the Roswell incident, I have always thought that to be a much more probable scenario.  They probably crashed a then top secret aircraft and didn&rsquo;t want it to get out to the public so created the weak &#8220;weather balloon&#8221; explaination then leaked the alien spacecraft theory to throw everyone off the scent.  It worked like a charm; people want to believe.</p>

		<p>I guess I am shocked at the comments on here.  Are you guys serious?  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if some (only guessing SOME) of the posters on here who are claiming that believing in aliens is somehow &#8220;normal&#8221; are perhaps the same people who come on here and stick up for Asians as a big block of people continuously.  We just can&rsquo;t have an article on Amren showing that Indians and Chinese people overall are more superstitious than whites, now can we?  </p>
<p>Instead of debating whether or not aliens &#8220;could&#8221; exist, let&rsquo;s focus on the overall point of the article.  The overall point of the article is that Third World populations are overall more superstitious than white people are.  Why is anybody on here shocked by this story?  I just took it for granted when I read it.  Why are we even discussing this?</p>
<p>But just as an aside note, I am curious to see the full list of countries and how they stack up.  I would guess that the white population of America by itself would rank below most Western European countries (with country number 1 being the most rational on the topic), but at the same time well above countries like China and India.<br>

		<p>     All work and no play makes Jack a dull fellow . This is an interesting and harmless diversion . And if by chance a UFO should land tomorrow in front of the Whitehouse, then it all becomes pertinent . I have searched the skies since the sixties and have seen some really strange things . But nothing that I believe could not be reconciled with a plausible explanation . I do believe we now have an aircraft that will outstrip the capabilitites of the SR71 . Based on what I have seen lately in the night time skies .  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t trust the official government version of Roswell or anything having to do with aliens&hellip;they blow it off as due to misidentification, hoaxes, too much Jack Daniels, swampgass, atmospheric anomalies, birds, balloons, or secret military aircraft. I would concede that 99% of the UFO cases can be attributed to the above, but that still leaves 1%, which is hundreds of sightings annually that are inexplicable, and can only be have extraterrestrial origins. I think our government knows a lot more than it is telling us and will never come clean. Does this mean I will now be visited by Men in Black? Bring it, you freaks&hellip;<br>

		<p>I crunched the numbers once to try and get a handle on how many other technological civilizations we share our galaxy with, and I think I got something like 10 to 100 (due to the &#8220;slop&#8221; inherent in some of my assumptions.)  Given the distances involved and the horrendous travel times these distances entail, there not only won&rsquo;t be any space wars or invasions, but there won&rsquo;t even be any peaceful contact.</p>
