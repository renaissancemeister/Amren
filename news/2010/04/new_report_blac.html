<h1>New Report: Blacks Make Big Gains in Iowa Population</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Petroski, Des Moines Register, April 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These recent arrivals represent a slice of the growth and future of Iowans with African heritage. The number of black Iowans nearly doubled to 80,516 between 1980 and 2008. They now represent 2.7 percent of all Iowans, census records show. That number is expected to more than double by 2040 to 172,770, which would be 5 percent of Iowa&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>These statistics are part of a new state snapshot, &#8220;African-Americans in Iowa: 2010.&#8221; Paired with 1980 census data, the report shows today&rsquo;s black Iowans divided into haves and have-nots: More black Iowans own their own businesses and have earned high school and college degrees. But more than a third live in poverty, a higher percentage than a generation ago.</p>
<p>That troubling statistic could inhibit economic growth and well-being for the entire state, Iowa leaders say.</p>
<p><b>Blacks make gains, but gaps remain</b></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s driving the population growth? The migration of black people from other states and foreign countries and a higher birth rate for blacks than for Iowa&rsquo;s overall population, said Iowa State University sociologist Sandra Burke. This is consistent with a trend over the past four decades.</p>
<p>Former Des Moines Mayor Preston Daniels, who heads Iowa&rsquo;s Department of Human Rights, said the dramatic increase of Iowa&rsquo;s Latino population, now 4.2 percent of the state&rsquo;s total, has tended to overshadow the increasing numbers of black Iowans and their progress in recent years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy-nine percent of black Iowans ages 25 and older in 2008 had at least a high school education. That&rsquo;s up from 61 percent in 1980, according to census records. About 16 percent had a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, compared with 12 percent in 1980.</p>
<p>But other statistics indicate a wide gap in the well-being of black Iowans vs. all state residents.</p>
<p>* The poverty rate for black Iowans was 35.6 percent in 2008, compared with 11.5 percent of all state residents, census records show. That&rsquo;s higher than in 1979, when 28.2 percent of black Iowans lived in poverty, compared with 10.1 percent for all Iowans.</p>
<p>* Of black Iowans ages 16 and older, 64.9 percent were in the labor force in 2008, compared with 70.2 percent of all Iowans.</p>
<p>* The median income of black families in 2008 was $27,000, compared with $61,663 for all Iowans.</p>
<p>* Black Iowans are more likely than other Iowans to wind up in prison.</p>
<p>The most recent unemployment information for black Iowans showed a jobless rate of 8.9 percent in 2008, compared with 3.9 percent for all Iowans.</p>
<p>Nationally, the unemployment rate in March was 16.5 percent for black Americans and 9.7 percent for the overall population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Changing population creates some tension</b></p>
<p>A steady influx of black people to Iowa, many from Chicago, Milwaukee and other urban areas, has created tension in some Iowa communities.</p>
<p>White, blue-collar Charles City in northern Iowa, with about 7,500 residents, experienced some social friction about five years ago when 25 families moved from Chicago to take advantage of more readily available public housing. Within about two years, 44 black children from Chicago enrolled in Charles City&rsquo;s public schools.</p>
<p>Some residents complained of spikes in crime at the time, but police denied it. Mayor James Erb said recently there is still some grumbling related to residents in public housing, but people are generally getting along.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it here. The safety is the biggest thing,&#8221; Jones [Dorothy Jones, a black newcomer from Chicago]  said.</p>
<p>Burlington, population 25,300, like some of Iowa&rsquo;s other Mississippi River communities, has also gained new black residents from Chicago. Many have come to work for Tyson Foods in nearby Columbus Junction.</p>
<p>That has led to unease among some older residents who aren&rsquo;t used to seeing groups of young black people standing on Central Avenue, a major traffic artery, said City Manager Douglas Worden.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Community leaders have worked hard to provide diversity forums and training, which have been well received, &#8220;but we still have a ways to go,&#8221; Worden added.</p>

Gee, If only they were 2.7 in my state I&rsquo;d be thrilled!!</p>
<p>&#8220;The migration of black people from other states and foreign countries&#8221; is driving the population growth.<br>
Yeah, all those unassimilable Somali refugees that continue to be dumped in our country, often in the whitest areas to boot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Community leaders have worked hard to provide diversity forums and training, which have been well received, &ldquo;but we still have a ways to go,&rdquo; Worden added.&#8221;<br>
Well, Mr Worden, just how many of these vibrant, dynamic blacks families have moved to your neighborhood?! </p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to add that Barrack H. Obama won his first primary in Iowa, so this state has a sizable population of giddy white liberals with very romanticized views redarding blacks. </p>

		<p>I was discussing with a friend today how the projects in Chicago, Milwaukee, other areas have been drained and the residents setup in small towns in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa and lo and behold, I see this article which confirms this trend; after-the-fact of course.  I live in the Midwest and have seen the results first-hand over the years. Now these once peaceful and safe small towns have similar crime rates as the big cities and some neighborhoods are downright dangerous.  The most incredible aspect of this is the denial about the issue expressed by the townspeople and local governments.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve recently moved to this state and I&rsquo;m witnessing first-hand the beginning signs of demographic transformation. Part of me feels that I should promote awareness on this issue. But white Iowans are largely ignorant of what diversity is like and won&rsquo;t understand what I would have to tell them. Some have even had the gall to tell me how wonderful diversity must be in my old home state of Connecticut. There are a good number of mixed-race couples as young white Iowan girls are no doubt charmed by black males from Chicago. </p>
<p>Things will certainly be interesting. It will be sad seeing Iowa change; I came to this state partly to escape the new Latino Connecticut. I suppose it will come to a point where we whites will have no where else to run and we will have to put our feet on the ground and say &#8220;Enough&#8221;. Perhaps Iowa will be where our last stand will be. </p>

<p>Iowa is over 90% white.</p>
<p>It stands to reason, that a doubling of &ldquo;African-Americans in Iowa,&rdquo; would show only that diversity &ldquo;enriches&rdquo; everyone. Thus, all blacks should be pimping czars and wiggling princesses in the &ldquo;economic recovery&ldquo; process of Comrade Obama&lsquo;s reign, in this godforsaken place of whiteness, Iowa. </p>
<p>Funny, how that never seems to happen? </p>
<p>Of course, Detroit, a city as black as midnight without the stars and moon, is in good really shape&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.but Iowa languishes until &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is embedded in it endlessly?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Diversity training and forums for who, the blacks coming in to town or the whites already there. Why is it that whites are always the only ones who need diversity training. So I guess if a bunch of whites left those towns and went to Chicago and a black neighborhood that the blacks living there would be asked to attend diversity training. I think not.</p>

<p>Can we have a comparison of these figures for blacks living in Detroit, Oakland, Newart, E. St. Louis etc.!</p>
<p>said Quentin Hart, a Waterloo City Council member and associate director of multicultural affairs at Hawkeye Community College. &#8220;We as a state need to look at what we can do to empower blacks so we don&rsquo;t continue down a perpetual rate of lower median incomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the heck is an &#8220;associate director of multicultural affairs&#8221;. WHAT do they do! I&rsquo;ve never heard of so many made-up jobs in my life. Of course none of the White sheeple in Iowa has the rocks to ask this racist WHY White Iowans have an obligation to empower blacks and how many Whites are being &#8220;empowered&#8221; by blacks in Detroit.</p>
<p> &#8220;We know that if children have quality early childhood experiences &hellip; they are going to be productive citizens because they understand the value of education,&#8221; Doby said.<br>
 &#8220;Our emphasis here is on trying to create more jobs, and that hasn&rsquo;t got anything to do with white or black,&#8221; Erb said.</p>
<p>White people like this make me want to throw-up. THEY are the problem, not the blacks. All of us here see what&rsquo;s coming their way don&rsquo;t we. Like watching a train wreck. But don&rsquo;t try to warn them, they&rsquo;ll call you a racist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their culture that they brought with them from Chicago. They hang out like that,&#8221; Worden said. &#8220;In Burlington, the culture is that you sit on your back deck.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re &#8220;hanging out&#8221; like that because they&rsquo;re claiming their turf. They&rsquo;re taking over your town you idiot! They&rsquo;ll soon be bringing even more of their Chicago &#8220;culture&#8221; with them as well - - rape, robbery, murder, drugs, baby-mommas, baby daddies etc..</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t help but notice that when the percentage of whites anywhere in the world is decreasing, be it Iowa, California, England, France, Australia or Russia, the overall tone of these articles in the mainstream press is that this is a positive development.  Why are the hostile elite so gleeful?  I think we all know the answer.    </p>

		<p>I invite all readers to do a little digging through our local liberal info rag-The Quad City Times, to see for themselves how often Blacks kill each other here.  Two murders last week.  People who don&rsquo;t live here are usually surprised to hear about how many gangsta wanna-bes are living in Iowa.  Yes.  Iowa.  Liberals in charge have behaved typically and done their part to create a safe area for criminals.  We are in the middle of Chicago, St. Louis and Detroit and libs are creating a similar sewer here.  I want to move to Texas.  At least I can defend myself there. </p>

		<p>This article has a rather celebratory tone about it. I rather doubt that most Iowans will be celebrating in the decade ahead,as increasing numbers of blacks bring their favorite occupation, violent crime, with them.</p>
<p>Iowans would do well to import several million rattlesnakes from Arizona and New Mexico in order to control &#8220;burgeoning rodent populations.&#8221;  I suspect the rate of black immigration would slow also with the publicity accompanying such a program. </p>

		<p>First come the blacks then comes the crime and the cries for FREE welfare. Why don&rsquo;t these blacks ever do anything to HEP themselves? Why do they always seem to lay in wait, much like a vulture waiting to feast on the unearned meal of some unfortunate creature? It&rsquo;s not RACISM when time and time again peoples expectaions of the times to come after the arrival of blacks comes to pass. </p>

		<p>There is rarely a place more welcoming than Iowa. The over- arching culture is  that way, and seemingly always has been. I was born in Burlington Iowa, and have been there over and over seeing family and friends. In the past 40+ years I have witnessed the growth of the black population, most from other states. I have seen the clueless whites trying to emulate black low class culture (big rims, huge stereos, pants drooping) As well as how genuinely welcoming the Adult whites are to have them. They are still a small percentage, but as that changes, they will show more of their true nature in greater numbers. Nothing more sad than to see the gullible white Iowa girls pushing their half black babies in shopping carts, while their thuggish sperm-donors slouch along behind.  The mexicans/hispanics mostly keep to themselves, but then most all of them are working in the processing plants. They tend to attract much less attention to themselves. <br>
As was posted before, there are many many white Iowans who genuinely think that BHO as president would heal our racial differences. I am related to many, which makes for a long awkward dinner conversation.  They have no idea what they are in for when blacks reach 10% of the population. </p>

<p>You are so right. Years ago my famly from Wash. St. couldn&rsquo;t understand for the life of them why members of my immediate family would make comments singling out blacks and their behavior. &#8220;They&rsquo;re just like us,&#8221; they would protest.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I love it here. The safety is the biggest thing,&rdquo; Jones [Dorothy Jones, a black newcomer from Chicago] said. </p>
<p>Of course you &#8220;love it here,&#8221; because you have temporarily escaped from a dysfunctional Black community to a functional White community, and because Whites will provide for you.  Whites are capable of creating safe, wealthy, and civilized communities; Blacks are not.  Blacks realize that if they are forced to live around other Blacks, their lives will be miserable.  That is why virtually all Blacks try to escape other Blacks and move into a White community (where they will subsequently complain about &ldquo;racism&rdquo;).  </p>
<p>The problem is, soon the number of Blacks will increase in that peaceful, safe community, and all the social pathologies common among Blacks will reappear.  You get temporary relief from your dysfunctional racial kin, while the previously nice White community gets destroyed.<br>

<p>Probably just some overpaid hack living off the taxpayer. For real scams under the rubric of &#8220;multicultural affairs officer&#8221; or whatever they want to call themselves, try colleges and universities. Nearly every school has at least one on staff and the salaries they get are outrageous. Of course no one ever asks them what they do to earn 250-300k a year. You just need to issue a few press releases every year and smile for the cameras. It&rsquo;s an appalling waste of money and resources. So called &#8220;diversity&#8221; offices accomplish nothing and do absolutely nothing to further the mission of any college or university. </p>

		<p>Iowa City/Coralville has experienced an influx of blacks from Chicago bringing with them the normal urban maladies which destroyed the bigger cities. The city councils have actually actively recruited blacks in Chicago to come to Iowa! They are setup with section 8 housing, which of course is NEVER near the neighborhoods of the council members. Blight, crime and white flight follow as sure as the sun rises in the East.<br>
Turn on the news in eastern Iowa and in Waterloo, Cedar Rapids, Coralville/Iowa City the crime stories invariably feature blacks and often their relatives from Chicago. Import ../../../../__8216.css;diversity&rsquo; and you import the criminal element.<br>
The stupidity of white liberals never ceases to amaze me. This state is responsible for being the launching pad for Obama&rsquo;s presidency.</p>

		<p>I was born in Des Moines and raised in Marion and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Hardly ever saw a black person - there was one in my H.S., but he was recruited to play basketball. Most blacks were miles away near the downtown area. Of course, back then, crime was low, and the most criminal behavior I was subjected to was once losing a bicycle tire pump to a thief at school. I don&rsquo;t know how it is now there, since I moved to Florida in 1982.</p>
<p><i>More black Iowans own their own businesses and have earned high school and college degrees. But more than a third live in poverty, a higher percentage than a generation ago.</i></p>
<p>The primary reason for such troubling statistics is that welfare, food stamps, etc. are not counted when determining a household&rsquo;s income, so I have heard. People in &#8220;poverty&#8221; these days just so often aren&rsquo;t in reality. Even the illegals who are supposedly not eligible for food stamps get them somehow, through document fraud or whatever other means. And &#8220;Temporary Assistant for Needy Families&#8221; for their anchor babies.</p>

		<p>Oh, and lovely to see the &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are at 4.2%, which is probably only half of the real total, as those illegals don&rsquo;t like to talk to government officials, unless there is money going into their pockets (i.e. welfare).</p>
