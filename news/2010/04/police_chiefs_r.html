<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police Chief George Gascón offended some Arab Americans when he spoke about the potential for terrorist attacks on the Hall of Justice.</p>
<p>A breakfast to tout the importance of passing an earthquake-safety bond measure on the June ballot wound up sending shock waves through San Francisco&rsquo;s Arab American community after Police Chief George Gascón made controversial remarks about terrorism.</p>
<p>Gascón reportedly said the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant St. is susceptible not just to an earthquake, but also to members of the city&rsquo;s Middle Eastern community parking a van in front of it and blowing it up.</p>
<p>The chief was addressing a crowd of about 150 City Hall officials and members of the building trades Wednesday and was one of several speakers discussing the $412 million bond to seismically retrofit a number of city buildings, including moving some Police Department functions out of the decrepit Hall of Justice and into a new Mission Bay facility.</p>
<p><b>Chief cites countries</b></p>
<p>Despite some reports to the contrary from those in attendance, Gascón on Thursday said he never referred to Middle Easterners or Arab Americans.</p>
<p>He said he instead singled out those from Yemen and Afghanistan as posing potential terrorism risks  &mdash;  especially in an iconic city like San Francisco with large numbers of residents from those countries. He admitted to saying they could park a van in front of the Hall of Justice and blow it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no need to single out the two countries, and I recognize that, but it&rsquo;s not because it was not accurate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The reality is this is the area where we&rsquo;re seeing most of the international terrorism coming from.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think certainly in this case, people are reading too much into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Commitment to diversity</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mirkarimi [Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi, who is of Iranian descent] said Gascón is a quick study who&rsquo;s unlikely to make the blunder again. But he added that it&rsquo;s poor timing considering City Hall plays host to a Persian New Year celebration tonight.<br>

		<p>I think American citizens who love their country are TIRED of not being able to speak the truth.  This man told it like it is; any thinking American knows that Islam, being the ONLY religion that demands its adherents kill non-adherents, is THE most dangerous threat to the USA and the entire world today.  Their stated goal is to take over the world by whatever means necessary, and impose shariah law on everyone.  So what&rsquo;s wrong with suggesting that Yemeni and Afghanistani immigrants pose a real threat to the city of San Francisco???  It&rsquo;s TRUE - they do.  And if those people can&rsquo;t admit it, too bad.  At least the rest of the population has been warned.</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t Afghanistan and Yemen on some State Department naughty list because of terrorism?  All Chief Garcon seems to be doing is reading.</p>

		<p>The Chief should also have singled out Saudi Arabia for mention too, maybe more emphatically. Saudi Arabia is where all the muslim trouble in the world is coming from, and like  black failure, the government is refusing to admit it because Saudis own so many of them.</p>

		<p>It certainly seems reasonable that people from a country with large terrorist networks might try to recruit citizens of that ethnic background.</p>

		<p>Well, I have an Arab last name (though I&rsquo;m  a 2nd generation 100% AMERICAN- my dad, God bless him, was a WWII combat vet)-and I AM NOT OFFENDED AT ALL.<br>
Anyone who is, does not belong here. <br>
The USA should live as George Washington instructed us&hellip;to have commerce with all, and treaties and entanglements with none. Ergo, we should get all our troops back here, to defend OUR LIBERTY, not to impose an alien concept like democracy on people who neither want it, or can currently use it. <br>
That said, Arabs can be justifiably mad at our stupid wars to aid the commerce of WalMart and the Oil companies, or an arms industry that is as scrupulous as the pharmaceutical industry (although they probably kill less people!)<br>
But they don&rsquo;t belong here if they have those feelings, because they are too great a potential danger to the USA. Sad but true. </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make up these harsh rules&hellip;I&rsquo;m not the architect of such a demented plan. Thank The Bushes and Obama, and the obscenely corrupt Congress for that mess. I&rsquo;m just calling the truth as I see it. Oops&hellip;the truth&hellip;must be a &#8220;Blunder, huh, Mirkarimi?<br>
 Man, you&rsquo;re a real jerk. One Mid-easterner to another, so it&rsquo;s &#8220;all in the family.&#8221; (God, I miss Archie Bunker).</p>

		<p>Kind of &#8220;if the shoe fits, wear it!&#8221; If Muslim (Arab) terrorists are mostly always identified as those committing acts of terror   &mdash;   bombings, etc., why in hell would officials suspect any group OTHER than Muslims/Arabs? What angers me is the utter criminal stupidity of our government in allowing unchecked immigration in the first place! Clearly a stab in the back for American people&hellip; who&rsquo;s taxes nearly always have to be used to support immigrants. Conversely, with those immigrants capable of working&hellip; providing still more UNNEEDED competition for Americans in a steadily shrinking job market.</p>
