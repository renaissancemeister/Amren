<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/apr/07/greenspan-fannie-freddie-central-crisis/">Greenspan Deflects Blame for Crisis</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrice Hill, Washington Times, April 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday testified that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played a critical role in fostering an explosion of growth in the subprime mortgage market that led to the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Deflecting the blame from himself and the central bank, which had broad authority to regulate banks and the mortgage market, the former Fed chairman, in testimony before the congressional Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, gave the most prominent voice to date to Republican charges that congressional meddling with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played a critical role in the run-up to the crisis that brought down the global economy in the fall of 2008.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan pointed to the mandates Fannie and Freddie received in 2000 from Congress and the Clinton-era Housing and Urban Development Department to make housing more affordable to minorities and disadvantaged people by using their vast resources to purchase more subprime mortgage securities.</p>
<p>As the mortgage giants started to scarf up the subprime securities, much of which had been engineered to earn AAA ratings from credit rating agencies, that caused rapid growth in the subprime market, he said, estimating that it burgeoned from less than 2.5 percent of the mortgage market in 2000 to encompass 40 percent of Fannie&rsquo;s and Freddie&rsquo;s mortgage portfolios by 2004.</p>
<p>The enormous appetite for subprime mortgages that Fannie and Freddie brought to the market is the reason that interest rates on mortgages fell so dramatically from 2003 onwards and many exotic instruments were created to satisfy the demand for the loans, including extremely low initial &#8220;teaser&#8221; rates, loans with no down payments and so-called liar loans where people didn&rsquo;t have to document their incomes to get loans.</p>
<p>&#8220;A significant proportion of the increased demand for subprime mortgage-backed securities during the years 2003-2004 was effectively politically mandated,&#8221; Mr. Greenspan said. &#8220;The subprime market grew rapidly in response [to political mandates and] subprime loan standards deteriorated rapidly,&#8221; worsening an investment bubble that was already developing in the housing market, he said.</p>

		<p>I halfway agree and halfway disagree with the analysis that government pressure is solely to blame for the subprime debacle ergo the financial collapse.  All these banks and investment houses hire oodles of lobbyists   &mdash;   they knew what the government forced them to do would hurt them, so why didn&rsquo;t they engage their lobbyists?  </p>
<p>Also, these firms have a lot of economists on staff.  They (and most everyone else) bet their futures on perpetually rising real estate; they figured that it didn&rsquo;t matter if we made lousy mortgages, the real estate market will rise forever, and will surely cover any bad loans.  The obvious flaw in that thinking was that the only reason real estate was shooting sky high in the first place was precisely because of all these junk mortgages   &mdash;   they couldn&rsquo;t be approved forever, so there had to be an end to the Ponzi scheme (of sorts).  I&rsquo;m some nobody from nowhere who figured this all out, yet six-figure salary economists at Lehman, or Sterns, or Morgan, couldn&rsquo;t grasp this?</p>

		<p>I hope everyone has seen the 2004 c-span video of barney frank maxine waters and several other black congressmen insulting and ridiculing the head regulator of fannie mae/freddie mac, explaining to him how wonderful fannie mae was, how great it was that people of color were getting home loans. At a time when action could have prevented the world wide financial collapse, democrats and blacks chose to put their own narrow interests first. what else is new</p>

		<p>For quite a long time, a lot of people tried to explain the deleterious effects of mega-retailers like Wal-Mart, using facts, logic, reason and evidence.  It went over most people&rsquo;s heads.  JibJab creates a video called Big Box Mart?  All of a sudden, people get it.</p>
<p>I could spend a lot of time typing out a lot of long winded, accountanty explanations to what caused the subprime crisis and the resulting crash in the financial system.  But instead of boring you with that, I&rsquo;ll direct you to Steve Sailer&rsquo;s parody entitled, &#8220;Unreal Estate.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s almost as easy as watching a video.</p>

		<p>#1 Question Diversity  &mdash;   I&rsquo;m also a nobody from nowhere and I&rsquo;ve figured out something else about this too. I suspect that another large underlying factor in this whole thing came about as a result of the deindustrialization of our nation. The only way to artificially gin up the gutted national economy lost to global third world helot industrial labor forces was through construction of a whole lot of housing that technically wasn&rsquo;t needed. Ergo, the only way to sell it was to make it easier to buy for a dweller than for the same dweller to pass a landlord&rsquo;s background check for a rental application.</p>
<p>My guess is that there are in the gross aggregate national housing stock (notwithstanding the fact that illegal aliens live ten to a house designed for max. four occupancy) there are about three habitable bedrooms per capita in the US.</p>

<p>I agree.  It did present the allusion of manufacturing going on at a time when real manufacturing was being gutted.  </p>
<p>This is why I cringe at the talking heads on TV who say we need to get the real estate market hot again.  Why?  So that no native born white American can ever afford a house ever again?  It&rsquo;s going down because it should be going down.  It should have never gotten that high to begin with.  It was unconscionable that real estate ever shot that high.  The average selling price in the San Fernando Valley went from 150 in 1997 to 600 in 2007.  Can you afford 600g for a house, even with loose lending standards?</p>
<p>Aside from returning the old proven 20% down (*) and 28% of gross income hard-and-fast standards, one other common sense mechanism that should be added is that, even if there is more than one bacon bringer-homer in the household, only one person&rsquo;s salary should be used for mortgage eligibility.  This would:  (1) Make it a lot easier for one parent to work and the other to stay home (NOTE:  Don&rsquo;t care which one works and which one stays home, not being sexist here), b/c houses would be affordable for one wage earner, (2) Discourage the cram-jam mentality of Mexicans and other Indo-Americans, where they cram 30 adults in a house, all of them are either working some legal or illegal job, or collecting welfare, and all that money can be used to determine mortgage eligibility, which drives up real estate.</p>
<p>* - A few weeks ago, I explained why the 20% down payment floor was crucial, and why its disposal was a big mistake, in another AR thread:  <a href="/news/2010/03/revenge_of_the.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2010/03/revenge_of_the.php</a></p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see the phrase &#8220;sub-prime loan&#8221; come back, I was afraid that it had gone down the memory hole.  I don&rsquo;t care what Alan Greenspan did in the past, right now, he&rsquo;s a big name calling attention to the costs of diversity.  </p>

		<p>This is an excellent example of what I mean when I say that the drive for diversity, multiculturalism and PC is a condition which is doomed to self destruct.  It isn&rsquo;t necessary to perpetrate any kind of destructive policies or any kind of violence, because things have deteriorated, and will do so at an even greater pace, all on their own.</p>
<p>Self destruction of the multicult agenda is exactly what has occurred these last several years until we&rsquo;ve come to a point where this entire country&hellip;.including the rest of the West&hellip;.will go bankrupt and belly up.  And the policies promoted by this present administration are aiding in that destruction.</p>
<p>The Rahm Emanuels can claim all they want about taking advantage of a crisis, but the coming situation will one that they will be lucky to escape without being scalped.  They&rsquo;re more naive and silly than I give them credit for if they think they&rsquo;re going to be able to do anything but fight for survival.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re heading for collapse for certain.</p>

		<p>For those who don&rsquo;t speak &#8220;Liberalese,&#8221; let me translate:<br>
The word &#8220;sub-prime&#8221; translates roughly into &#8220;undeserved&#8221; or &#8220;sure to fail.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Once you can speak &#8220;Liberalese,&#8221; which is the preferred language of our government, everything makes sense.</p>

		<p>The Sailor article is a good one.</p>
<p>Other aspects were the community re-investment acts and admendments which allowed Child support and welfare to be counted as income and removed child care costs as expenses. These guidelines alone allowed a huge number of minorities to apply for home loans.</p>
<p>The largest single group growth in home ownership during the late 90&rsquo;s and first decade of 2000 was in fact single women.</p>
<p>Guess which sub-prime group of loans are the largest defaulters&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Underdog #4, thank you. I, too, have been touting the responsibility of those who sent all our manufacturing jobs overseas for the bulk of the economic disaster that they have created in this country. With the tax incentives and low import taxes, along with the passage of NAFTA, plus a hysterically self-destructive immigration [lack of] policy, our traitorous &#8216;leaders&rsquo; have taken the cash flow from our people by taking their jobs, prohibiting them from buying everything from houses to cars to lawn service, to groceries. I fail to see why I&rsquo;ve seen NO ONE publicly make a connection between our economy, immigration and exportation of jobs.</p>
<p>To create jobs, we simply need to bring back the manufacturing jobs we farmed out to China, Mexico and the rest of the slave labor nations. Government jobs -including the [TEMPORARY, mind you] Census jobs -which are the only jobs being created - are simply another paycheck created by and and a drain on our tax dollars.</p>

		<p>I see how some here blame the less than 20% down payment.  I disagree.  I put down 5% 14 years ago.  I picked a house I could afford.  I had a stable job and no debt and good credit.  The bank said (in 1996) I could have a $135,000 mortgage.  I thought that was way too much for me to carry.  I finally found a cute little house for 119,000 and financed 114,000.  I never missed or made a late payment.  I love my house that I can afford.  To deny the lower income but frugal worker with good credit a 5% down payment isn&rsquo;t the answer if he or she is responsible and has proven it.  A relative of mine, also working class, got one and she never messed up.  So it depends on the borrowers credit and work history.  Low income combined with irresponsibility is the killer.  Not to mention buying more house than you need or can afford.</p>

		<p>I have worked in the mortgage business for the last decade. Subprime loans were sold to people with shaky credit worthiness (mostly non-white) on the basis that before the low teaser rate expires, the mortgage broker or bank would help them to finance that into a 30 year fixed rate mortgage because there would be enough equity accrued in their home to cover any new closing costs. </p>
<p>House flippers (mostly white) bought, did cosmetic updates then flipped homes at outrageous prices causing all values to rise. </p>
<p>When the lenders put the brakes on the flippers, they defaulted of course. Values dropped and those subprime loans teaser rates adjusted with no equity to do anything. </p>
<p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac changed the rules at congress&rsquo;s demand. Bill Clinton and George Bush went along with it, because to each of them, a homeowner is a conservative person vs. a non homeowner. Clinton wanted them to remember who helped them,  Bush was thinking he was creating more conservatives.</p>
<p>And here we are today&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Greenspan told the truth about housing crisis which cascaded into the entire finacial scheme.  Before Bush and before banks/mortagage cos sold all the financial instruments  - government legislated Fannie &amp; Freddie to bring real estate under government control so it could sell homes and keep promises to special interests. The platform for selling homes to people who would not qualify under regular banking rules comes directly from government orders.   Everyone else was just following gov orders. Financial professionals knew the loans could not be repaid so they diversified the risk (even here diversity did not work) Much fraud occurred and the regulators failed to regulate. The roots of financial crisis was from legislated lending requirements that forced or fined banks to violate requirements necessary to maintain financial integrity.<br>

		<p>We knew this of course and South Africa is trying the same gambit with the new Credit Act law where banks are to be forced to make loans to non-whites regardless of their creditworthyness.  It is part of Karl Marx&rsquo;s system as written in his book in 1867 (it is nothing new), Das Kapital, where to change a capitalist country to Communism, get everybody into grave debt so the govt./tax payers have to bail out the banks and major companies efectively controlling the economy directly etc. to avoid a meltdown of the financial system.</p>

		<p>Indeed, and the irony here is that builders/developers in this country had in all probability enjoyed an almost 20 year run of the highest volumne and profit margin business since Levittown post WW II (maybe even greater) until the 2008 bust. </p>
<p>The highest gross profit margin, of couse, being almost entirely attributable to using Hispanic construction labor paid under every kind of fraudulent payroll/&#8221;sub-contractor&#8221; management scheme imaginable. A post-mortem on income taxes evaded and fraudulent tax credits claimed by both labor and employers in this last construction boom would yield some pretty impressive figures and some very interesting new accounting magic for future case studies. I would like to see Steve Sailor undertake that project. I don&rsquo;t believe for one minute that much of the &#8220;benefit&#8221; of Hispanic construction labor was ever translated into sales prices for the finished product either.(at least not until after the crash and price collapses) </p>
<p>To get an idea of the level of income tax fraud involved just take a look at this Federal case out of Upstate SC and adjacent NC border counties:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/yedcsmt</p>
<p>Nowadays I see former high rolling local construction contractors (who three years ago were running two and three crews of Hispanics all over town building spec houses) begging to rebuild small decks at the widow woman&rsquo;s house. I have no sympathy for any of them. They frittered their ill-gotten money away on giant bass boats, Harleys, beach houses, and elk hunting expeditions to Montana. </p>

		<p>Gee, Alan. Steve Sailer is way ahead of you. So now let&rsquo;s see: minority loans, minority immigration, and minority entitlements tanked the economy. So we elected a minority president to ensure more of the same, plus ObamaCare, another minority entitlement. Shouldn&rsquo;t white people start getting angry just about now at the Ivy League suits in business, politics, and the media who engineered this disaster.

		<p>Of course the present financial crisis is the worst to hit the World for at least 80 years.<br>
 It has simply destroyed the national finances of many nation states, Greece is a good example, but also Great Britain which faces a period of the most extreme economic retranchement that will blight the lives of generations to come.<br>
 The cause? A perfect confluence of the arrogance of big business and the endless pandering of successive US administrations using government interventions to favor those whom they deem to be more &#8216;worthy&rsquo;.<br>
 The first cause can be explained as inherent in any capitalist system, but the second is the most pernicious and dangerous, willfully ignoring as it does scientific facts in ethnic IQ differences and the communistic, nay feudal, abuse of democracy into a fiefdom based hierarchy of privilege and exploitation.</p>

<p>I agree with the literal substance of what you&rsquo;re saying, but I still think that if everyone had to pony up 20%, it wouldn&rsquo;t mean that fewer people would be able to afford houses, it&rsquo;s that houses would become more affordable.  </p>
<p>Unlike President Bush, I don&rsquo;t think down payments are racially discriminatory.  However, it is perfectly obvious that certain races of people have a hard time saving money, so the disparate impact works against them.  Still, we&rsquo;ve seen the folly in working the system around them.</p>

<p>These bad loans were then turned into so called &#8216;Mutual Funds&rsquo; and sold as &#8216;infallible&rsquo; investments by the same banks and agencies who received bailouts. Meanwhile, those of us dumb enough to buy the AAA credit ratings and the optimistic assurances of our bankers (who are now, thanks to relaxed regulations no longer &#8216;bankers&rsquo; but Brokers) lost our collective selves when it all went bust.<br>
Just another form of wealth redistribution.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think putting 20% down is necessary or the answer to solving the mortgage crisis. Homes should not have been so expensive in the first place. Food, clothing, shelter, basic transportation, and basic medical care are necessities, not luxuries. A home is a necessity. A person cannot go more than three hours without shelter of some kind and a home provides shelter from the elements.</p>
<p>That being said, it was people of color who bought $500,000 homes when they were working low-paying jobs (think a short-order cook in a motel or diner), who defaulted on their Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs). </p>
<p>Because the U.S. government required banks, financial institutions, and real estate agents and brokers to sell homes to minority buyers, the bankers and financial wizards repackaged these mortgages as derivatives to a least make some kind of money on the deal. I don&rsquo;t think they expected the glut of homes to come on the market when the ARMS readjusted from the low teaser rates ($199 a month for a $500,000 home often turned into a $4,000 a month or more mortgage for that short-order cook). We have casino capitalism in this country and it is just not working.</p>

<p>Can you understand why I think that is a contradictory statement?  </p>
<p>I do agree that teaser-rate ARMs, and ARMs in general, were/are part of the problem.  During the height of the subprime lending circus, interest rates, and ergo ARM rates, were lower than they&rsquo;ve been in my lifetime.  On top of that, teaser/intro rates seemed to make the payments even more affordable, but the teaser period expires, and ARMs adjusted upward on top of that.  ARMs are almost impossible to get these days, and for good reason.<br>

<p>Owning a house is not a necessity.  You can always rent.  You have a poor understanding of economics if you do not understand the relationship between loose lending standards and high house prices.  When banks demand a 20% down payment that makes people less willing to bid for overpriced houses so it keeps the prices down.  Frankly, if you can&rsquo;t save up a 20% down payment nobody should rationally expect you to be able to pay off the remaining 80% of principal with interest, while paying utilities, insurance, maintenance, and property taxes.</p>
<p>For someone my age (I&rsquo;m in my 50s) I would consider it very foolish to make less than a 70% down payment.  Do I really want to be in my late 70s with a mortgage payment still due?<br>

		<p>It is NOT true that the CRA and Fannie and Freddie solely caused the housing bubble. Wall Street caused it. Prior to Wall Streets entrance as mortgage financier and repackager, Freddie and Fannie were the mortgage backed security bond mechanism.</p>
<p>Since they were the only game in town they dictated the rules, which were very strict. Once Wall Street smelled this money they got into the game. But as always happens in a &#8220;free market&#8221;, standards drop to what ever it takes to get a deal done.</p>
<p>First Wall Street only bought good prime mortgages and repackaged them. Meanwhile mortgage companies that were not subject to CRA oversight found out that slightly lower qualified (ALT-A) borrowers were good risks IF the interest rate was raised to compensate for the minute increased risk of default. Since these borrowers had no choice they could be gouged and were actually making more money for the lenders. Expand this to a lower class of borrower and you have the invention of the subprime loan.</p>
<p>These were all mostly white and Asian borrowers with a few black and Mexican high earners. As Wall Street kept ramping things up, looking for more mortgages to feed their repackaging into bonds, the standards kept falling and mortgage brokers could still sell this junk because Wall Street convinced people that their slicing and dicing magic took junk and made it roses so they could continue to buy all the mortgages.</p>
<p>Fannie and Freddie were actually late to the subprime disaster. Maybe you forgot all those Orange county mortgage companies or Countrywide that collapsed one year after reporting record earnings and handing out million dollar bonuses to the equivalent of office clerks.</p>
<p>I have read comments from a very well respected thrift (First Fed Financial) in Santa Monica who survived the S&L; disaster but admitted that they had to make these loans because they had no business if they didn&rsquo;t even though they knew there was something rotten. Fannie and Freddie had to make these loans anyway. IN fact, F&F; were only responsible for 20% of the subprime mortgage backed security market.</p>
<p>This CRA crap is all Republican propaganda to deflect blame from Wall Street and the banks, those loans would have been made to whites without jobs as well as blacks and Mexicans. It was all about Wall Street&rsquo;s commissions and bonuses. Go out to the Inland Empire - do you think that was entirely inhabited by Mexicans and blacks? Nowhere else imploded as bad as there.</p>

<p>This is EXACTLY what cause the LBO market of the 80&rsquo;s to turn into the S&L; crisis. A very good idea (junk bonds) by a very smart guy (Michael Milken) turns to crap when too many players enter the market. As long as Milken was the only game in town he only made deals with solid companies with solid management. Soon every dumb idea gets financed, even those that even the principals know are going to bankruptcy court in a few years. Why? Everybody needs those fees to eat and there&rsquo;s no fraud if everybody keeps his mouth shut and pretends that the deal could be good but we can never be sure.</p>

		<p>23 &amp; 26 QD is on to something here.  Look at your home insurance and see how much the replacement cost of your house is.  My property value is more than five times the cost of rebuilding the house.  Is my 7000 square feet of dirt really worth that much more than a 1200 square foot house?  Most of that difference is in years of real estate speculation.  If there was nobody to pay $400,000 for a house, the price would drop until somebody could afford to buy it.  When people earn more money, or the government changes the rules to make it easier to buy, the &#8220;value&#8221; increases, to soak up all that money.  Nobody, real estate broker or homeowner, sells for less than they think they can get.      <br>
     If a 20% down requirement was enforced, the prices would come down until people could afford that amount.  That&rsquo;s not going to happen because it would depress housing prices overnight and impoverish tens of millions whites whose only savings are their home equity, as well as drive most Blacks and Hispanics out of the house buying market.  But a responsible financial industry could increase the minimum down incrementally over a period of years to limit home ownership to people who pay their bills, as well as making it cheaper.  Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a better world, $200,000 houses owned exclusively by people who are disciplined enough to save $40,000?  </p>

		<p>27 WR:  You raise another point, alluding to another factor in the subprime circus that I forgot:  Longer terms.  Even before the market heated up, some mortgages in CA were being drawn with 90-year terms.  Good luck ever paying your 90-year mortgage off.  Of course, you never will.  The point is to &#8220;own&#8221; a piece of real estate in which you are slowly gaining equity (though if you look at an amortization schedule, you can see that principal is most slowly paid off the earlier in the payment schedule you go), and to be able to write off the interest on your tax return.  </p>
<p>A fashionable neo-con social theory held that those who &#8220;owned&#8221; were better behaved than those who rented simply because the fact that they had skin in the game was an incentive for them to behave.  So Kempians like George W. Bush bent the rules to get as many blacks and Hispanics into houses as possible.  How did that work out?  Own or rent, blacks and Hispanics are just that, nothing more.  </p>
<p>28 Mark:  I think you&rsquo;re on the other undesirable extreme from those who only want to blame the CRA and government.  I&rsquo;ve looked at this issue a lot of ways, and I don&rsquo;t think big banking and finance disliked the CRA.  If they did, why didn&rsquo;t they deploy their army of lobbyists to oppose it or have it repealed?  The reason is that they agreed with the CRA, because corporate America has thrown in with the diversity nonsense as much as government, because corporations have devolved into mini-governments, if you will.  (If you work for a corporation, then you are well aware that, in your personal life, they can wield power like a government.)</p>

		<p>Question Diversity:</p>
<p>I am NOT in the OTHER extreme. I have read ALOT about this from many people in the financial press. The consensus is like the articles I showed you that say CRA was insignificant. This law was around since 1977 and only now it causes problems?</p>
<p>The CRA only says you must treat minority customers the way you treat whites, it was in response to bank redlining. Banks would take deposits from minority neighborhoods but not have a loan desk (the loan volume was probabaly too small to support the extra personel at that branch and not a case of &#8220;racism&#8221;). It says NOTHING about having to make loans to minorities with lower credit ratings. I used to have a link to a story about banks in the midwest that complied with CRA but did not initiate subprime mortgages. They were NEVER under pressure to make bad loans or threatened about merger plans like these stories all say. Why were only the banks who needed an excuse for their poor management the ones the government leaned on?</p>
<p>This whole CRA meme started when the financial press started to place the blame on the failure of the mortgage market to regulate itself. If you paid any attention to big L libertarians and other free market types you are contradicting their fundamental axiom that free markets always work and are always superior to everything. I first saw this CRA excuse on Lew Rockwell. Steve Sailer is another one of these types and he should stick to movie reviews.</p>
<p>The Republican pundits and the likes of Michele Bachman picked up on it and ran with it. It just makes it so simple and it gives the Republicans a way to hide from the fact that THEY are Wall Street&rsquo;s toties. Wall Street has done more to destroy America than any other entity. Wall Street not only created this bubble in housing but it the major entity to finance off-shoring of jobs and provide advice on how to do it.</p>
<p>Without Wall Street&rsquo;s easy money this would have never happened. Subprime mortgages were created and existed for no other reason than a whole lot of people were making money on them - the same reason we had a dot com bubble.</p>
<p>The market lovers would have you believe that the companies on Wall Street would NEVER do what they did on their own because they had to know it would eventually bring the company down and that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense would it? Therefore, the evil government had to be involved. Except for one problem. If I as a trader, can make in 5 years, what it normally takes me a career to make and I won&rsquo;t go to jail, will I do it? Multiply me by every trader in the company and you soon see why the company followed a self destructive path. </p>

		<p>31 Mark in LA:</p>
<p>The CRA has been amended at least once, maybe twice, since its initial version in 1977.  Articles I have read have stated that those amendments do entail affirmative action mortgages.  </p>
<p>However, giving you the benefit of the doubt, and assuming that the CRA is just as you say it is, don&rsquo;t forget there is such a thing as disparate impact.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 doesn&rsquo;t explicitly call for affirmative action in hiring, but many corporations have enacted such in order to comply.  And they didn&rsquo;t enact AA until well after 1964.  The immigration reform of 1965 doesn&rsquo;t specifically say that it&rsquo;s going to make America majority non-white, and Hubert Humphrey said that he would eat the paper the bill was printed on if it did such a thing.  And whaddaya know, it has.  But it didn&rsquo;t accomplish the travesty right away!</p>
<p>I agree with some of the rest of your missive, but I get the feeling that you&rsquo;re an anti-racist otherwise.  And before you start calling me a Wall Street totey, look at the argument I had on an earlier AR thread (post 5 above), where I took issue with poster who claimed the the Bush crowd wanted to &#8220;crack down&#8221; on the problem.  After they caused a good part of the problem, their &#8220;crack down&#8221; was simply a matter of putting a band-aid on a tumor.  However, the genesis wasn&rsquo;t pure WS greed, it was affirmative action race pandering, to increase the black and Hispanic home ownership rate.  Some WS firms benefited in the process and temporarily, but look at how it worked out for them in the long run!  Some conspiracy.</p>
<p>Bank redlining.  What&rsquo;s that?  Sounds like ACORN drivel.  You complain about banks taking deposits from people in &#8220;redlined&#8221; areas.  However, AR has a story about once every several months about some community activist hustler whining that too many blacks are &#8220;unbanked,&#8221; meaning they don&rsquo;t want bank accounts, because the authorities can look in on bank accounts for drug money, child support in arrears, etc.</p>

		<p>No QD I am no &#8220;anti-racist&#8221;. I referenced &#8220;red-lining&#8221; because that was the excuse used to bring this law into existence. You notice that I mentioned that the banks probably did not make loans in those branches simply because the loan volume would be too low (given the strict criteria to get any loan in the 1970&rsquo;s)to make having a full-time employee at the branch worthwhile and not the usual &#8220;racism&#8221; claptrap.</p>
<p>They edited my real word for what the Republicans are to Wall Street.</p>
<p>This law did nothing until and meant nothing until Clinton came in in 1994 and tried to polish his pro-minority bonafides. It was there the language relating to review of your CRA rating when aquisitions and the like was added, from what I read. It was never modified since then. Bush and others were leaning on F&F; to buy subprime loans. Nobody was using CRA to force the creation of subprime loans on banks that didn&rsquo;t want to do them. The government CANNOT do that unless there is language specifically protecting the bank against any loses that might arise from making such a loan. Imagine all the shareholder lawsuits against the government if a bank went under and had any substantial amount of CRA loans on its books.</p>
<p>We as race realists do ourselves no favors by falling for simpleminded politically motivated campaigns to deflect blame from Republicans, especially when the claims are so easily discredited, and especially when the Republicans are no friends of ours.</p>
<p>F&F; for 60 years had a stellar record for managing the mortgage backed security market. F&F; are PRIVATE companies and would not have been buying subprime loans if these loans weren&rsquo;t already being packaged and sold by other entities. That was what they were &#8220;pressured&#8221; to do - go in there and buy with the other guys. The claim by Greenspan that this kept rates low is nonsense - He kept rates low. He just wants to deflect blame like the rest. Remember, Citibank, B of A, Wachovia, and the brokers themselves were all insolvent because they were buying or providing the money for subprime loans from their associated mortgage houses and couldn&rsquo;t unload them on investors before the music stopped. The difference between them and F&F; is that F&F; still had to stand behind those bad loans or risk their credibility and existence while the brokers had no obligation once they pushed that stuff on somebody else. Even with that, the small amount of loans in the in-between stage going bad was enough to bring down the big banks and brokers. How did AIG end up on taxpayer life support without Wall Street? </p>
<p>CRA was around since 1977 and it wasn&rsquo;t implicated in the real estate fiasco known as the S&L; crisis. I remember plenty of regions where real-estate collapsed and lots of borrowers lost their houses. I am sure there were quite a few minorities who got loans then. In my 40% Hispanic neighborhood we had plenty of foreclosures and a very high percentage of the defaulters were Hispanic.</p>
<p>These people are taking one pixel on the 1080p HD picture and trying to make you focus on that pixel only because it serves the Republican party. </p>
<p>I agree with everything you say about making loans hard to get in order to keep prices in check since almost all the money in real-estate is usually borrowed. However, trying to pin this all on non-white borrowers when ANYBODY who could fog a mirror could get a loan just makes us look stupid.</p>

<p>Look at your last sentence, that is where you went off the track. Exactly how was WS hurt by this? To me and as Matt Tiabbi has written - the fix was in. Yes some SHAREHOLDERS took it in the shorts when a merger was forced upon them. The company was already insolvent by then so they were lucky that got anything. Buy how many of the people that really count lost a buck? How many managing partners and executives lost a bonus payment? Don&rsquo;t you realize the dirty little secret of publicly traded companies - they are not run for the shareholders or the average employee - they are run strictly for the enrichment of the management.</p>
