			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Krikorian, Center for Immigration Studies, April 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WASHINGTON (April 29, 2010)  &mdash;  The new law recently signed by the governor of Arizona, SB 1070, makes it a crime to violate some federal immigration statutes. While the law is extremely popular in the state, with 70 percent of Arizona voters approving of it and just 23 percent opposed, it has raised controversy. Below is a brief summary of the relevant information on illegal immigration in Arizona, followed by a short analysis of SB 1070&rsquo;s major provisions.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration in Arizona:</p>
<p>* The federal government estimated that Arizona had one of the fastest growing illegal immigrant populations in the country, increasing from 330,000 in 2000 to 560,000 by 2008.1</p>
<p>* Arizona has adopted other laws to deter the settlement of illegal immigrants in the state in recent years. The federal government estimates that the illegal immigrant population dropped by 18 percent in the state from 2008 to 2009, compared to a 7 percent drop for the nation as a whole.2 This may be evidence that the state enforcement efforts are having an impact.</p>
<p>* The Maricopa County Attorney&rsquo;s Office has found that 22 percent of felonies in the county are committed by illegal immigrants.3 Illegal immigrants are estimated to be 10 percent of the county&rsquo;s adult population.4</p>
<p>* Analysis of data from State Criminal Alien Assistance Program showed that illegal immigrants were 11 percent of the state&rsquo;s prison population. Illegal immigrants were estimated to be 8 percent of state&rsquo;s adult population at the time of the analysis.5</p>
<p>* Approximately 17 percent of those arrested by the Border Patrol in its Tucson Sector have criminal records in the United States.6</p>
<p>* The issue of illegal immigration and crime is very difficult to measure, and while in Arizona there is evidence that illegal immigrants are committing a disproportionate share of crime, it is not clear this is the case nationally.7</p>
<p>* In 2007, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that 12 percent of workers in the Arizona are illegal immigrants.8</p>
<p>* In 2007, the Center estimated that illegal immigrants and their U.S.-born children (under 18) comprise one-fifth of those in the state living in poverty, one-third of those without health insurance, and one out of six students in the state&rsquo;s schools.9</p>
<p>* In 2007, the Center estimated that one-third of households headed by illegal immigrants in Arizona used at least one major welfare program, primarily food-assistance programs or Medicaid. Benefits were typically received on behalf of U.S.-born children.10</p>
<p>* The new law (SB 1070) is extremely popular among Arizona voters. A Rasmussen poll found that 70 percent of voters approve of the new bill, and just 23 percent oppose it.11</p>
<p>Among the new law&rsquo;s provisions:</p>
<p>* The new Arizona law mirrors federal law, which already requires aliens (non-citizens) to register and carry their documents with them (8 USC 1304(e) and 8 USC 1306(a)). The new Arizona law simply states that violating federal immigration law is now a state crime as well. Because illegal immigrants are by definition in violation of federal immigration laws, they can now be arrested by local law enforcement in Arizona.</p>
<p>* The law is designed to avoid the legal pitfall of &#8220;pre-emption,&#8221; which means a state can&rsquo;t adopt laws that conflict with federal laws. By making what is a federal violation also a state violation, the Arizona law avoids this problem.</p>
<p>* The law only allows police to ask about immigration status in the normal course of &#8220;lawful contact&#8221; with a person, such as a traffic stop or if they have committed a crime.</p>
<p>* Estimates from the federal government indicate that more than 80 percent of illegal immigrants come from Latin America.12 Thus, there is concern that police may target only Hispanics for enforcement.</p>
<p>* Before asking a person about immigration status, law enforcement officials are required by the law to have &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that a person is an illegal immigrant. The concept of &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; is well established by court rulings. Since Arizona does not issue driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal immigrants, having a valid license creates a presumption of legal status. Examples of reasonable suspicion include:</p>
<p>    &mdash;   A driver stopped for a traffic violation has no license, or record of a driver&rsquo;s license or other form of federal or state identification.</p>
<p>    &mdash;   A police officer observes someone buying fraudulent identity documents or crossing the border illegally.</p>
<p>    &mdash;   A police officer recognizes a gang member back on the street who he knows has been previously deported by the federal government.</p>
<p>* The law specifically states that police, &#8220;may not solely consider race, color or national origin&#8221; when implementing SB 1070.</p>
<p>* When Arizona&rsquo;s governor signed the new law, she also issued an executive order requiring the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board to provide local police with additional training on what does and what does not constitute &#8220;reasonable suspicion.&#8221;13</p>

		<p>The politically correct media and all of the illegal immmigrant allies say that the police can stop anyone who looks Mexican or has an accent.This is a flat out lie that is repeated over and over again, and most of those who hear it will believe it. They have to stop someone for a separate issue before they can inquire anyone about their immigration status. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you how this law will actually be applied.</p>
<p>Officer sees a mexican or group of mexicans driving in a car.  Officer pulls that car over for &#8220;speeding&#8221;.  Officer asks for proof of citizenship.  Since proof of citizenship isn&rsquo;t forthcoming, officer searches car.  After finding several hundred thousands of dollars of drugs in the car, everyone in the car is now going to prison.</p>
<p>Rinse&hellip;.repeat.</p>
<p>You see the REASON why mexicans are so upset about this law has nothing to do with immigration.  It has to do with drugs.  Most of the mexicans in the US are involved, one way or another, in the drug trade.  Mexican immigration is one giant scam by which American welfare monies are funneled into the mexican narcotics industry (and the related &#8220;underground economy&#8221; of guns, sex slavery etc.)  That is the primary purpose of mexicans, both legal and illegal, in coming to the US.</p>
<p>The arizona law makes it too dangerous for these people to traffic in drugs.  The color of their skin becomes de facto &#8220;probable cause&#8221;.  Mexicans will be under much higher scrutiny, simply because they are mexicans.  For normal, law abiding people, that is not a big deal&hellip;..but for a group whose purpose of being somewhere is largely to engage in criminal behavior, it&rsquo;s a VERY big deal.</p>
<p>This law has several goals.  The primary goal is to disrupt the drug trade.  That is job one.  Too many people are being murdered, kidnapped, etc. related to the drug trade.  But a secondary purpose of this law is to drive the mexican drug traffickers out of the state&hellip;..to the states right next door.  The idea here is to wake up those people and state governments to the problem and FORCE their cooperation in dealing with the problem.  As the number of mexican tolerant states shrinks, the size of the problem in the remaining states expands dramatically.</p>
<p>The long term goal is to force the realization among Americans in general that &#8220;immigration&#8221; is primarily about stealing welfare and funneling it into drugs to finance paramilitary psychopaths.  When that understanding becomes widespread, the federal government will have no choice but to respond (or be left behind as others respond).  Notice that it is very close to this already.  Amnesty marches no longer have non-mexicans attending&hellip;.why is that?</p>
<p>Since everyone on the federal level knows what I just described above, one might wonder why they have to be strong armed into responding appropriately.  One might also wonder what it means that the states are willing to do so after decades of ignoring the problem.</p>
<p>Something fundamental has changed lately among those who wield power.</p>

<p>Well that is a concern.  I think law enforcement agencies should also case establishments like Chinese restaurants, nail salons, dry cleaners, message parlors and ethnic food stores for the other 20 percent.  </p>

		<p>I am so tired of the political correctness that is controling all this. If the US goverment would uphold the laws that are on the book we would not have the new Ariz. law. Each state has a right to protect its citizens. <br>
I just can&rsquo;t help but wonder why the illegal immigrants want to be in the US anyway. When we see them on the news they are always protesting against the US. I have yet to see them act like they really want to be here. They disrespect our laws and the people. They disrespect our flag. To me they are just trying to make the US the same as there home country with all the same problems.<br>
If they really want to be in the US then start showing a little respect to our country. If you want to be here show it or go home. I have worked with immigrants and know many that are here legally. They are great people and really act like they really want to be here. I don&rsquo;t think that is to much to ask from anybody. And that would solve a lot of the problems.</p>

		<p>I very much support the law.  Everything said on this site is correct in my understanding.</p>
<p>One very, very critical point for me: it will slow the narcotics flow into this country through AZ.  It will make it a lot harder to get the dope into AZ cities.  The kids might just grow up without the trauma of having to use narcotics because the other kids do.</p>
<p>Thank you Arizona.</p>

<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I raced by the ten multiplied by three milepost in life, one of the hard lessons I had to absorb is that human beings, even relatively intelligent ones in advanced societies, just aren&rsquo;t that cerebral.  Most people do most things they do for motivations that are depressingly simple.</p>
<p>I applied my newfound life lesson to advocates of the school of thought known as anarchy, and figured that illicit drugs, and the easy supply thereof, is their chief motivator for doing what they do and advocating what they advocate.</p>
<p>And, like you, I think drugs are also the reason for all these exotic noisemakers against SB 1070.</p>
<p>If we had an FBI we could be proud of, they&rsquo;d get their forensic accountants to work.  I bet they would find that the money trail leading to this milieu against SB 1070 has its other end in two places:  (1) Mexican and other Indo-American drug gangs.  (2) Saudi Arabia, or some other petro-buck rich Middle Eastern country.  Hezbollah has already been confirmed on the Southern Border, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if some radical Islamic neer-do-wells are financing the opposition to SB 1070 to keep the southern border open for AQ-style jihadists.</p>
<p>Of course, the forensic accounts are needed to sift through what is surely a multiple step money laundering process.</p>

		<p>Wise analysis Incognito. Reveals knowledge of internal procedures and a very probable unknown reason for it all. Finally, money is at the bottom of the issue, not justice or anything also. &#8220;Love for money is the root of all evil&#8221;. Love for money, that is. People loved money more than their own lives and kill for it. Bottom line - like accountants like to say - weather it is immigration or drug trafficking, both of them are money related: if it&rsquo;s uncontrolled immigration the cost of it are staggering, and if it&rsquo;s drug trafficking, add to that the social cost. In both cases, if the US does not implement something to curve it, it will very soon be the Dis-united States. Beside, what&rsquo;s wrong with taking your ID with you anywhere? We do that with the Driver&rsquo;s Licence, anyway. </p>

		<p>I read this carefully, and I fail to see what the problem is.  I think the Hispanics really believe that they are above the law and should somehow be exempt therefrom - but only them; they want every other group of immigrants have to obey the existing laws!</p>

<p>this comment in response to Frank Rich&rsquo;s NYT column - the usual garbage about racist tea partiers - was recommended by 500+ readers:</p>
<p>I am a longtime resident of Phoenix, Arizona. About a third of my neighbors are of some degree of Hispanic origin. Much more than ten percent of my neighbors are gay. My barber is from Iraq. My cardiologist is Pakistani, my General Practitioner is a born again Christian woman. My closest friend is Jewish, another is a Christian Navajo, and I am an Atheist. How dare you try to lecture residents of Arizona about getting along with people different than them. This state has a long tradition of being a melting pot. This state, also, has a long tradition of people getting along with each other. We just want the never-ending stream   &mdash;   no river   &mdash;   of people, coming here illegally and stayng, to stop. Now, if your Governor, Frank, says that we can provide illegal immigrants with a one-way ticket to New York; then maybe our problem will be resolved. But, frankly, we can&rsquo;t handle the overload anymore. President Obama needs to stop campaigning and playing golf long enough to do the job for which he was elected. Once the borders are sealed and protected, then we, in Arizona, can go back to living our very tolerant and diverse lives in peace.</p>

		<p>The funny thing is this isn&rsquo;t about immigration or arizona law at all.  It&rsquo;s about fascism being imposed on us by manipulation, without the military force to back it up.</p>
<p>Unless a person is completely brainwashed, what our government is attempting to do to us is obvious and could fill volumes of several books describing specifics.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to draw attention to the REACTION to what is being attempted.  People seggregating themselves out by race and idealogy.  States preparing to decide for themselves what laws apply to the areas they control.  Lack of trust in the very legitimacy of the federal government itself has become widespread.  More importantly, it is well on its way to becoming institutionalized.  I cannot help but notice that a rather large number of states have quietly mobilized what amounts to state controlled armies.  Meanwhile, more guns have been bought by private citizens over the last year or so than are needed to outfit the top ten militaries combined.  CLEARLY, something is up.  And because what this is seems to be decentralized, it is difficult to get a grip on.  Difficult for the forces of fascism (or as Ron Paul calls it&hellip;corporatism) to fight against.</p>
<p>But they are trying.  With control of the media, they are desperately trying to deny what is becoming more and more obvious.  Americans won&rsquo;t cooperate just because they say so. And Obama and his masters are not even closed to being able to force us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this is all about.  Americans want the country purged of all illegal and most legal immigrants.  The media wants us to believe that attitude is &#8220;controversial&#8221; instead of widespread.  The government wants us to believe that arizona is being disobedient by taking real steps to make that happen.  They want us to think arizona will be punished and then forced to come to heel.  None of that is true.</p>
<p>In the end, all these people have to contol us are manipulation and brainwashing.  And it&rsquo;s just not working anymore.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the catch, should we somehow get rid of every illegal mexican in the U S, which is never gonna happen, we will still have legal mexicans, hence the unsolveable problem would still exist. Since political correctness does not equate in my mind I will say the following: &#8220;The problems we have are not just {ILLEGALS}{or MEXICANS.&#8221;} However one thing at a time. Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day, neither was it destroyed in a day.</p>

Go back to your &#8220;tolerant&#8221; and &#8220;diverse&#8221; lives&hellip;Two words that have DESTROYED White America!  And you are all for it? I really don&rsquo;t care about YOUR take on your neighbors and acquaintances, but I have seen far too much of diversity and &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and those who seem to enjoy it.  So I would assume you are all for 3rd world immigration starting in 1965?  And PLEASE stop with the &#8220;melting pot&#8221; cliche! There is no such thing as different races etc melting to form on big happy family. That is another made up term like racist is a made up word!</p>
