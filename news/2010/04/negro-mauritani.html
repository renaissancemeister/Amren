<h1>Negro-Mauritanians Complain About Complete &#8216;Arabisation&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Middle East Online, April 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mauritania&rsquo;s ruling Coalition of Parties of the Majority (CPM) has accused the opposition of whipping up ethnic tension after violent clashes between Moor and non-Moorish students.</p>
<p>CPM president Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamed on Sunday night told journalists that he condemned &#8220;a desperate attempt by some opposition parties who falsely interpret government declarations, to revive matters of ethnic allegiance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The opposition is waging a smear campaign holding that Mauritania is in a state of continual crisis. The real objective is to undermine the big projects currently on hand and those on the drawing board,&#8221; Mahmoud Ould Mohamed added.</p>
<p>The main party among 11 in the CPM is the Union for the Republic of the west African state&rsquo;s President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.</p>
<p>On April 15, Moorish students clashed at Nouakchott university with Negro-Mauritanian students who were protesting over what they described as the &#8220;complete Arabisation of the administration&#8221; in Mauritania, a mainly desert nation where the Moors historically ruled over black African southerners.</p>
<p>A student who asked not to be named said that several people were injured by hurled stones.</p>
<p>Police stormed the campus and made about 30 arrests from the rival sides, a security source said. They used their batons and tear gas to break up the clashes.</p>
<p>The violence followed a series of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations about the language of the administration.</p>
<p>French-speaking students and opposition members, mainly Negro-Mauritanians, object to what they see as their exclusion from jobs, while Arabic speakers protest at the place given to French in the educational system and in the administration.</p>
<p>The polemic erupted after Mauritania on March 1 celebrated the day of the Arabic language, when Prime Minister Moulaye Ould Mohemd Laghdaf stated that the civilisation of the country was &#8220;Arabo-Islamic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Minister of Superior Education Ahmed Ould Bahya tried to calm the situation down by declaring that &#8220;no option for a complete Arabisation&#8221; has been undertaken by the government.</p>
<p>The Coalition of the Democratic Opposition (COD), which includes the major opposition parties, stated at the end of March that the government was taking &#8220;demagogic&#8221; positions in the language debate.</p>
<p>The COD warned against the &#8220;risk of awakening ethnic dissensions and conflicts.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I take it the Negro-Mauritanians are French speaking and do not like Arabic becoming the only national language.  These Negro-Mauritanians are very similar to Euro-Americans who get upset over the Hispanization of the US.  It seems Negro-Mauritanians are as lazy (and racist) as Euro-Americans when it comes to accepting and learning the dominate language of their home nation.</p>

		<p>Dear  Post # 1,</p>
<p>You are absolutely correct in that Blacks cannot get along with anyone.  In Southern California, I have seen them attack in succession, Whites, Jews, Arabs, Koreans, Indians, Hispanics, Chinese, and Iranians   &mdash;   mostly store owners in or near Black neithborhoods. In each case they claim that these &#8220;outsiders&#8221; are taking advantage of them, by opening stores near where they live.  After they drive out the merchents, the Blacks complain about &#8220;racism&#8221; because there are no stores in their neighborhoods. There is even fighting between Jamacian, Hatian, and African Blacks vs. African-Americans.  Blacks cannot even get alongwith themselves, and in California, are constantly &#8220;popping&#8221; oneanother.  Truly a very aggressive and unreasonable race.  Compare this with Japanese-Americans, who get along with everyone.</p>

<p>While I hesitate to take sides, in fairness it must be pointed out that blacks are the ones who are having an alien culture and language imposed upon them by supposedly &#8220;tolerant&#8221; Moslems.  It is just the same as in the Sudan where blacks are being either wiped out or &#8220;Arabized&#8221;.  So much for the myth of Islamic tolerance. The Koran teaches that, apart from conversion, these &#8220;abeedim&#8221; are fit for only slavery or death.</p>

<p>No race get along with any other race if their number is big. <br>
That is nature tribe. And who are we to fight against nature? Only liberals -who already have seen even babies are racist- are stupid enough to fight nature and believe in victory.</p>

		<p>LOL.  This  is  just  amusing because the so-called Moors  of  Mauritania are in  reality  Sahel  nomads who  fell  under the  colonizing impact  of  Islam and the  later colonizing effects  of  France.  Now  their officials  want  to  increase their  colonized  status  by  adding  in  the  Arabic  language.</p>
<p>In  the  Senegambia  region  they  are  known as  Nahs and  their  indigenous  language  has direct  connection with  Arabic. The ethnic connection  they  claim with  Arabia  is  purely  fictitious  like  the  dominant  elements of  Northern  Sudan.</p>
<p>It  should  be  noted  too  that  the  majority  of the  population  are  not  Moors(a significant  number  are  Barack  Obama  lookalikes  with  the  rest  being  somewhat  darker)  but  West  African  Wolof  and  Peul.  The  present  power  structures in  that  society  derives  principally from  French colonial  machinations.</p>

&#8220;CPM president Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamed&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t know how &#8220;Arabized&#8221; is Mauritania these days, but if this person&rsquo;s name is any indication, it must be very Arabized indeed. Three of this person&rsquo;s four names are either &#8220;Mohamed&#8221; or some variation on it. I&rsquo;m willing to be that not even amongst the most ignorant and superstitious mestizos in Mexico will you find someone named &#8220;Jesus Jesu Jose Jesucristo.&#8221; </p>
<p>This sort of fanatical, almost OCD-like devotion to naming themselves after their &#8220;prophet&#8221; should tell you all you need to know about Islamic mind control. </p>
<p>That said, I suspect the Arabs are the lesser of two evils in Mauritania. This &#8220;Arabization&#8221; being done to the blacks there may be &#8220;unfair&#8221; but   &mdash;   because Arabs are at least a LITTLE higher up the Evolutionary ladder than Africans   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s probably the best thing for everybody there. Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamed may have a dumb name, but if he knows enough not to grant full equality to Sub-Saharans, then he possesses a better understanding of the world than our deluded white liberals here in the West. </p>

<p>He flew along that coast as a pioneer opening up air routes and knew a lot about the local culture. Although Mauritania was shown on the map as &#8216;French&rsquo; this was largely a fiction because local on-the-spot power remained in Berber-Moroccan hands; slavery was a fact of life and accepted with a shrug by the French.</p>

		<p>Arabs despise blacks intensely and Arab culture is one of the most imperialist cultures in the world. Many of today&rsquo;s Arabic speaking countries weren&rsquo;t originally Arabic. By the expansion of Islam, Arab culture and language spread around as well. </p>
<p>They absolutely don&rsquo;t promote (and tolerate) multiculturalism wherever they live. Most of the &#8220;Muslim&#8221; criminals in the west are North Africans and Middle Easterners.</p>
<p>Slightly off the topic: Does anyone know why Arabs are not that intelligent today? Oil laziness? They made great contributions in the history but they don&rsquo;t seem to be hardworking and smart nowadays.</p>

I do know that in Morocco some blamed it on the [modern] custom of sleeping with women (instead of with boys, as in the old days).</p>
<p>A million illogical &#8220;reasons&#8221; can be found.  Just as some clerics in Iran today are blaming earthquakes on impious women.</p>
<p>I suggest:  How about the importation of blacks and gradual corruption of the gene pool?   This did happen in Morocco and Egypt, though not in Turkey.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Yes.  And Arab genes too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that what you and SKIP say is true, and I don&rsquo;t doubt  you.  But I have carefully observed the interactions of black and Arab &#8220;youths&#8221; (black and North-African) in French cities, and all I see is comeraderie and no hint of any racist feelings among them. They seem to get along extremely well, despite the racial divide.   I realize that I am not privy to what they privately think or say, but that is what I see.</p>
<p>I wonder if this may come from a sense of solidarity among newcomers  united against the old, established population?  I wonder how long this solidarity will last?  I wonder if it&rsquo;s only superficial?   The only things uniting them seem to be immigrant status and Islam.  I would have added: poverty.  But no, they are really living quite well on generous French welfare and housing subsidies, so they&rsquo;re not living in poverty or squalor, unless they choose to.<br>

<p>If  Arabs despise blacks  intensely  as  you  claim  then  they will  have  to  despise a  portion of themselves.  The  authentic Arabs  &mdash;  i.e., those  from  the  Arabian peninsula  carry  African  genes from  sources both  remote  and  more  recent.  Just  visit Arabia  and  the  Gulf  states  and examine the  Arab  phenotype.</p>
<p>The same  for the  Arabized  people of North  Africa.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Self-hatred  and confusion about ethnicity is not at all an unusual thing in this world.</p>
<p>For one example, just look at the comtempt that the black and brown &#8220;Arabs&#8221; of the Sudan have for the black peoples of the South. They are often just as &#8220;black&#8221; as those whom they despise, but would be insulted to be told so.</p>
<p>I fremember, from my anthropology classes, many years ago,  the story of a  captured Shilluk or Nuer who was raised among the Dinka  [tribes of the Sudan].  He grew up among the Dinka, hating the Nuer &hellip; who were, after all, his own people!    &mdash;   genetically, at least. But he didn&rsquo;t see it that way.  [Probably from the classic work, &#8220;The Nuer&#8221;, by Evans-Pritchard]  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wtmtb3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2wtmtb3</a></p>
<p>The famed Janissaries, feared troops of the Ottoman Turks and slaves of the Sultan, were children of Christian families, taken from them  (by the child tax, the Devshirme) and raised as devout Moslems, brought up to hate Christians.</p>
<p>And there were  numerous stories of white children captured and raised by American Indians, who grew up hating whites and preferring to live among the Indians.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all nothing new.</p>
