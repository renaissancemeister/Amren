<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They&rsquo;re white. They&rsquo;re older. And they&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>CBS News and the New York Times surveyed 1,580 adults, including 881 self-identified Tea Party supporters, to get a snapshot of the Tea Party movement. There is a lot of information to unpack; let&rsquo;s begin with the demographics. </p>
<p>Eighteen percent of Americans identify as Tea Party supporters. The vast majority of them  &mdash;  89 percent  &mdash;  are white. Just one percent is black. </p>
<p>They tend to skew older: Three in four are 45 years old or older, including 29 percent who are 65 plus. They are also more likely to be men (59 percent) than women (41 percent). </p>
<p>More than one in three (36 percent) hails from the South, far more than any other region. Twenty-five percent come from the West, 22 percent from the Midwest, and 18 percent from the northeast. </p>
<p>They are better educated than most Americans: 37 percent are college graduates, compared to 25 percent of Americans overall. They also have a higher-than-average household income, with 56 percent making more than $50,000 per year. </p>
<p>More than half (54 percent) identify as Republicans, and another 41 percent say they are independents. Just five percent call themselves Democrats, compared to 31 percent of adults nationwide. </p>
<p>Nearly three in four describe themselves as conservative, and 39 percent call themselves very conservative. Sixty percent say they always or usually vote Republican. Forty percent say the United States needs a third party, while 52 percent say it does not.</p>
<p>They are more likely than American adults overall to attend religious services weekly (38 percent do so) and to call themselves evangelical (39 percent). Sixty-one percent are Protestant, and another 22 percent are Catholic.</p>
<p>More than half  &mdash;  58 percent  &mdash;  keep a gun in the household. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>What They Believe</strong></p>
<p>Fifty-three percent of Tea Party supporters describe themselves as &#8220;angry&#8221; about the way things are going in Washington, compared to 19 percent of Americans overall who say they are angry. </p>
<p>Asked what they are most angry about, the top four answers among Tea Party supporters who identify as angry were the health care reform bill (16 percent), the government not representing the people (14 percent), government spending (11 percent) and unemployment and the economy (8 percent).</p>
<p>More than nine in ten (92 percent) say America is on the wrong track, while just six percent say the country is headed in the right direction. Fifty-nine percent of Americans overall say the country is on the wrong track. </p>
<p>Eighty-eight percent disapprove of President Obama&rsquo;s performance on the job, compared to 40 percent of Americans overall. While half of Americans approve of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s job performance, just seven percent of Tea Party supporters say he is doing a good job. </p>
<p>Asked to volunteer what they don&rsquo;t like about Mr. Obama, the top answer, offered by 19 percent of Tea Party supporters, was that they just don&rsquo;t like him. Eleven percent said he is turning the country more toward socialism, ten percent cited his health care reform efforts, and nine percent said he is dishonest. </p>
<p>Seventy-seven percent describe Mr. Obama as &#8220;very liberal,&#8221; compared to 31 percent of Americans overall. Fifty-six percent say the president&rsquo;s policies favor the poor, compared to 27 percent of Americans overall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Views on Race</strong></p>
<p>Tea Party supporters are less likely than Americans overall to believe whites have more opportunities to get ahead than blacks. </p>
<p>Just 16 percent of Tea Party supporters say whites have more opportunities to get ahead, compared to 31 percent of all Americans. Seventy-three percent say both have equal opportunity, compared to 60 percent of Americans overall.</p>
<p>Fifty-two percent believe too much has been made of the problems facing black people. Far fewer Americans overall  &mdash;  28 percent  &mdash;  believe as much. Among non-Tea Party whites, the percentage who say too much attention has been paid to the problems of black people is 23 percent. </p>
<p>A majority of Tea Party suppers believe the Obama administration treats both blacks and whites the same way. But one in four believe the administration favors blacks over whites, an opinion shared by just 11 percent of Americans overall and seven percent of non-Tea Party whites.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m tired of seeing skinny, wispy-haired wanna-be beatnicks in sandals and ragged hiking shorts driving a Prius with a bumper sticker that says something like &#8220;Friends don&rsquo;t let friends vote Republican.&#8221; </p>
<p>Enough with the narcissistic altruism, that disgusting fakery of supposed good will intended only to put some tree-hugging simpleton with a broken sense of self-esteem in the spotlight. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that so many Tea Partiers came to the &#8220;Party&#8221; by virtue of losing their jobs, I truly am. But middle aged folks in their 50s and 60s are exactly who we need to have paying attention to the shenanigans going on in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Politicians and unqualified presidents have been able to run roughshod over this country because the people with the right combination of education and experience have heretofore been too preoccupied with making a living and providing for their families. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m single, and I&rsquo;m fairly young (38), but I&rsquo;ve got no problem that my &#8220;elders&#8221; in the Tea Party are hammering knuckleheaded politicians. I couldn&rsquo;t care less how the dimwits at CBS break down the demographics.</p>

		<p>These interviewed Tea Party supporters got it correct.  Hopefully, this is a start to take back this country.  All this pandering to blacks is a endless money pit, of course using other people&rsquo;s money.  The government is currently so corrupt and run by big money. The last presidential election was staged and rigged.  It was all about electing a black man to so call redeem this country for delusional past wrongs.  All the billions that have spent on the black race in this country and aboard have more than compensated them for whatever reason.  Why is there no talk about the black race being self responsible but rather treated as like children, constantly depending on others?  This childish dependence is sold to the public as racial inequaltiy due to the fault of others!  The blacks have been in this country longer than any other colored races but yet they receive the most welfare and aid in every sector of society.  When do they eventually become self sufficient?  More likely never.  When left to their own demise, they quickly decline to the lowest denominator.  It is now time to stop this enslavement to the black race imposed by the goverment of this country.  More power to the Tea Party supporters! </p>

		<p>It would be simpler to describe the Tea Party activists as the actual &#8220;taxpayers.&#8221; The people who pay taxes are beginning to get tired of out of control government spending and welfare programs that benefit other people who continually demand more and more from the working people of the country. </p>

		<p>The Tea party is an anti tax organization with lots of support from the usual conservative idiots, patriots, christian values culture and naturally anti abortion and gay.</p>
<p>Like every other conservative organization they are not White nationalist or race realists.  Who cares about them.  They will not help me or my family with affirmative action discrimination, black on White crime, the behavior of blacks in schools and the workplace or any other issue that is destroying Whites.</p>
<p>So who cares about the tea parties.</p>
<p>Not me.  Not my family.  Not any White person anxious to save us from the ethnic cleansing and genocide that is going on as the Tea Partiers wave the American flag, symbol of the nation that treats us as Germany treated Jews from March of 1933 (when Hitler seized power) to 1937 when the holocaust began.</p>
<p>Stalin had plans to exterminate each and every Ukranian, Chechan, Tarter, Crimean Muslim etc etc.  The Ukranians were to be the first target as they were considered the most powerful, intelligent, organized group most able to defy the communist regime.</p>
<p>Stalin decided against total genocide only because there were just too many Ukranians to totally eliminate. That&rsquo;s the problem with Whites.  Just too many of us.  And like the Chechans and others, many of us live in undeveloped areas that would be difficult for our ridiculous female and useless minority army to penetrate.</p>
<p>But in our grandchildren&rsquo;s time, when we are reduced to 40 percent of the population our government will move to exterminate us. It will start in New York City, California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico where Whites will be a minority in the next census.  </p>
<p>The Tea Partiers wave the American flag, symbol of the nation that is bent on destroying us. i look upon the American flag the same way the Poles and other Eastern Europeans look on the old Soviet Union Flag.</p>

		<p>Why go through the trouble of researching the Tea Party yourself or talking to people who claim to be Tea Partiers when you have Brian Montopoli of CBS News to tell you all you NEED to know?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re apparently just old ornery white racists from the South, Republicans in disguise.  Of course the fact that as a group they&rsquo;re more highly educated than the average American is a glossed-over footnote.  </p>
<p>Wait, now how can that be?  I thought all Southerners were a bunch of backward illiterates who are net tax consumers, subsidized by the rest of America?  I thought the schools in the South are horrible and producing a bunch of dumb rednecks?  All the federal data proves this right?</p>
<p>Actually no because what the data doesn&rsquo;t easily reveal is that of all the states that made up the Confederacy, only Texas has a black population below the national average.  The liberal narrative about all the rubes in the South conveniently leaves that part out.  </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s schools aren&rsquo;t failing white and Asian kids.  When the smug leftists compare our children&rsquo;s academic performance to homogenous white societies they should only compare the performance of our white and Asian students.  Same with health care, and just about every social category for that matter.</p>
<p>Sorry went off on a tangent there, but I just think maybe those &#8220;Teabaggers&#8221; know something about &#8220;diversity&#8221; that the New England &amp; Left Coast do-gooders don&rsquo;t, seeing as how they enjoy the wonders of &#8220;diversity&#8221; on a much more regular basis.</p>

		<p>Bill O&rsquo;Reilly tonight said the tea party percentage is now 24% of the population, not 18% as described above.  It seemns to be accelerating rapidly.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is that Jon Voigt and others have been appealing to people to get up off their couches and become active members.</p>
<p>But, getting back to this 24%, does anybody know if these percentages are based on the total population of the US or do they represent 24% of the electorate?</p>
<p>If 24% is based on total population that amounts to about 77 million people, which would be enough to win any national election, since only about 100 million out of an electorate of 160 million actually vote.   Surely they&rsquo;re basing their figures on the voting age public.</p>
<p>Does anybody know?</p>

		<p>The Tea Party I attended in my small town about 3 weeks ago consisted of about 100 people with the majority over 50.  There were several speakers with one cheerleading the wars, wars, wars in the Middle East and reading Old Testament scripture to support genocide and theft of land by foreign powers without one mention of the New Covenant.  Another one was making it painstakingly clear that &#8220;we&#8221; weren&rsquo;t racists and talked about illegal immigration being a problem but that &#8220;we&#8221; didn&rsquo;t have a problem with legal immigrants because America is a country of immigrants.  This sort of lame posturing and capitulation to leftist ideals is why the right is so weak and powerless.  I think the neocons are trying very hard to co-opt the Tea Parties or they already have.    </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.  Who will pay taxes when whites are gone?  Not trying to be snarky, it&rsquo;s a serious question. I&rsquo;m as paranoid as the next person, but I don&rsquo;t see the logic in elminating the single most productive group in the country.  <br>
 <br>
Blacks at least have some reason to imagine they&rsquo;re being targeted, because they must know they would never be missed.  But whites?  Where&rsquo;s the welfare money going to come from?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Tea Party supporter, I&rsquo;m white, female, almost 65, well-educated (Ph.D), but I don&rsquo;t have a hefty income.  The Dems are desperately trying to marginalize us - but we will stick together and make some significant changes this November.  Of COURSE we&rsquo;re angry - we are not marxists or Socialists, and we see B.O. spending our country into bankruptcy - (&#8220;It&rsquo;s the MONEY, stupid!) - and we want people who know how to handle money, how to refrain from overspending, and how to make it grow.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m White.  I&rsquo;m over 40.  I&rsquo;m angry.  We need to get a lot more White people angry, not necessarily only the over 40 ones but EVERY White person, young, middle aged, and older.  My concern is that the Tea Party movement is being hijacked by forces that are against what the Constitution and founding fathers wanted.  People have to be made aware that people like Sarah Palin do not represent what this movement should be all about.  She is a Republican and the Republican Party is just another side of the same coin that the Democratic Party belongs to.  We need a third party to separate ourselves from this mainstream that is destroying our country.</p>

		<p> I find CBS News&rsquo; statistics highly suspect. Only five percent of the Tea Party members are Democrats? I doubt that. More likely they cooked the numbers to low-ball the Democrats and make the Tea Party organization look like just an adjunct of the Republican party.</p>
<p> Highest percentage allegedly from the South? That&rsquo;s just a thinly-veiled liberal code for &#8220;racists.&#8221; Even if you believe that only 16 percent of Tea Partyers think that Whites have more opportunities to get ahead than blacks, the figure for the entire population is only 31 percent   &mdash;   less than a third.</p>
<p> And if you believe that only 28 percent of all Americans think too much has been made of blacks&rsquo; alleged &#8220;problems,&#8221; than I&rsquo;ve got a bridge in the Sahara Desert to sell you.  </p>

		<p> Were these tea party percentages being compared to white americans, instead of americans overall, I&rsquo;m sure the percentages would be much closer. Since the partiers are mostly concerned about taxes, and immigration it would have behooved them to have interviewed taxpayers only, since the parasites need higher taxes, and more government intervention. Plus I wonder how many of the interviewed were afraid to voice their true opinions, knowing they were being recorded?</p>

		<p>The tea party is, for many people, a first step towards activism.  It is an absolute certainty that a great many of them are racially aware, just as it is certain that many &#8220;liberals&#8221; are really Reds.  This is a de facto White group, and any of them who blather about having an open door for minorities will not fail to notice how few non-Whites are interested in letting productive White people keep their own money.  The TP is in reality a safe way for Whites to enter the racial struggle, and that&rsquo;s why the leftists worry about it.  </p>

I was at the first Tea Party here in Atlanta, which I thought it was something more than what it actually is.  <br>
Im with you on the Tea Party when you say its not a White Nationalist Party. I dont go to anymore of them strictly because it ISNT White Interested.</p>
<p>The blacks are hollering that its a (RACIST!!!) Party..so what do the weak ass Whites do?, The bring blacks to &#8216;show&rsquo; theyre not.<br>
They have this Lloyd character, clarence thomas with his White wife&hellip;herman cain and others.</p>
<p>NOW&hellip;.everybody is hollering about herman cain being president!</p>
<p>I agree with you on the Tea Party issue, but, about the American Flag&hellip;.I believe you got that all wrong, Brother.</p>

		<p>I think the Tea Party is a little too little, too late.  It remains in perpetual flux, and can easily be taken over by bona fide kooks who will make it look bad.  I needs a platform and a structure to make it a coherent third party choice.  There&rsquo;s no other way.  As currently constituted, it has little power and can spiral out of control.</p>

		<p>13 Schoolteacher:</p>
<p>The occasion of Clinton&rsquo;s comments was the upcoming 15th anniv. of OKC.  Of course, he revels in that day and anniversary, because it&rsquo;s the only real thing in his Presidency that makes him look good.  If you visit his Presidential Library/Adult Bookstore/Massage Parlor webpage, you&rsquo;ll see his OKC &#8220;collection&#8221; is prominently featured.  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worried about the TPM spawning another OKC.  How does he know?  Will Federal law enforcement provoke it just like Bill Clinton compel Federal law enforcement to cook up the first OKC?  (Ooh, I didn&rsquo;t just say that, did I?  Have I gone too far, or have I not gone far enough?)  Personally, if you ask me, if you want to find the rest of the story on OKC, go to Colorado&rsquo;s Supermax Federal Prison and find Inmate #03911-000.  </p>
<p>Clinton also blamed the internet for spreading this invective.  Okay then, if the internet is the problem, why did you let your Vice-President invent it?  (&#8220;I did not have sexual relations with that man, Timothy McVeigh&hellip;&#8221;)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>To some of the other posters:  I have mixed feelings about the TPM.  &#8220;M,&#8221; as in &#8220;movement,&#8221; is crucial here.  It&rsquo;s a movement, not a formal organization.  As such, anyone can organize one, and anyone can attend one.  However, what I have found is that the big names on local and regional bases that are the organizers are neo-cons   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s not as if the neo-con elite has to &#8220;ride in&#8221; and &#8220;co-opt&#8221; the TPM, the TPM was already neo-con to begin with.  </p>
<p>The reason I look forward to tea parties (I&rsquo;ve never been to one myself) is that I&rsquo;m sure that just the sight of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of people gathering to protest Obama gives some of our people hope, and it keeps them from giving up.  In the process, some people will end up here at AR.  While the TPM isn&rsquo;t a racialist movement, and is in fact the opposite, when you boil it all down, I think AR disparately benefits from the TPM&rsquo;s success.</p>

		<p>When I was seventeen, and too young to vote, I was already outspoken against big government.  Three years later, when I met my future husband, he wondered about my speaking out, and thought one day the boogeyman might come get me.  He wondered if I just might be a commie; but came to realize just how much of a red-blooded, flag waving, America loving patriot I am.  Now several years later we have a teenaged son who is just as much of a patriot as I could ever have hoped.  I took him to a tax day tea party and you could imagine his surprise to see a black man as a key speaker-Alan Keyes.  As well as several blacks in the audience.  He, of course has heard about all the media saying it&rsquo;s made up of nothing but white, racist, gun-toting Obama haters. All this is giving him the education of a lifetime, he told me that as well as he liked learning about the nation&rsquo;s history at school, there&rsquo;s nothing like actually living in historic times like these.  Oh, and he&rsquo;s no red neck bubba, junior, he is in the honor society, and a national merit finalist.  It is funny that CBS has actually given us credit for being pretty well educated, something I actually agree with them on.  I don&rsquo;t believe too much has necessarily been made of problems facing blacks, either.  They do, thanks to the government and their own lack of ambition, have many problems. I believe too much has been made of the so-called solutions that do absolutely nothing towards getting them off their backsides and off the welfare rolls.  No able bodied American should be able to just lounge around getting fatter and fatter off the government teat while popping out baby after baby, knowing that government daddy will take care of the bill.<br>
Oh, and #16 Frank, I agree with you on some of the whites bringing along token blacks to show they aren&rsquo;t racist I don&rsquo;t like Michael Steel being the head of the Republican party, however there are some, possibly many, blacks who really DO feel this country is going in the wrong direction.  Alan Keyes seems to be a patriot, unless he goes home and starts laughing at us whiteys behind our backs, about how he has pulled the wool over our eyes.  But, just as Colin Powell is a traitor to the conservative cause, always was in my opinion, I would not vote for Keyes if he ran for office.  You know the saying, Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Can&rsquo;t take the chance, even if the &#8220;perfect&#8221; black candidate appeared.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s disappointing to see the Tea Party leaders try to distance themselves from accusations of racism by spotlighting black speakers solely for being black and regurgitating tired rhetoric of immigrants being great for the nation as long as they are legal.  It appears the party leaders are following in the same footsteps of the Republican Party. </p>
<p>There is a silver lining. Unlike the speakers at the gathering, many of the attendees could very well be race realists who are attracted to an almost exclusively White movement. I think the mainstream media is correct in implying that when members in the crowd say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the direction the country is headed&rdquo; it is veiled racism. When many attendees say they are against the responsible citizens subsidizing the irresponsible, they are probably intelligent enough to know the racial makeup of each group. However, the career minded ones will not dare say a word since they want to return to work the following Monday. I think most of us are in the same boat. Despite the attempt by Fox News to dismiss the race angle from the Left, I believe the Left does have a reason to be concerned. And that is good news. I think in the future there will be a more overt pro-White stance taken at some of these rallies. Especially from the unemployed or the older members who no longer have a career to lose. </p>
<p>In the mean time, expect the mainstream media to focus on the least articulate pro-White attendees and Fox News to focus on those cheering the loudest for big-business, the Religious Right and Sarah Palin. <br>

		<p> - The Tea Partiers wave the American flag, symbol of the nation that is bent on destroying us. i look upon the American flag the same way the Poles and other Eastern Europeans look on the old Soviet Union Flag. - Poster #4</p>
<p>This is hard to argue with. That flag has unfortunately acquired that taint. It crept upon it over decades and no one noticed. It clearly no longer represents represents our founding values and culture. Less and less it represents our White European roots, or Whites. We are indeed being dictated to and our lives &#8220;governed&#8221; to the slightest detail - Washington, Moscow, what&rsquo;s the difference&hellip;?</p>
<p>The flag that will always represent Whites and our founding values is the old Betsy Ross flag with 13 stars in a circle. That is the flag to fly and display. Perhaps add an inscription reading: &#8220;It Is Time To Start Over.&#8221; It is indeed time to start over. Hard.</p>

		<p>The original Tea Parties that launched the movement back in 2007 were expressly anti-imperialist and anti-war as well as being against centralized governments and high taxes. The Tea Parties have changed drastically as they have been usurped by mainstream Republicans that are nothing more than liberal neo-conservatives. The movement has lost the majority of its younger base. Some may not care, but the youth are the future. Being a movement of mainly older White people complaining about Democrats is not a good place for growth. If the Tea Party movement wants to re-energize itself then it needs to return to the Constitutional principles that were the basis of the first events. </p>

<p>Unfortunately you are right.  Sarah Palin got paid $100,000 to speak at a tea party rally.  This is a woman who said that Obama would make himself more popular if he bombed Iran.  One of the few ways in which Obama is better than McCain is that he is a bit less likely to bomb Iran.  Anybody who favors never ending war, and a giant global military empire, and complains about high taxes, is a complete hypocrite.<br>

		<p>I am a South African white man, I have followed the international trends in immigration for the last couple of years. I have noticed that all over the world the white race is waking up and realizing again the value of our common ancestry and the value of our culture.  I don&rsquo;t know if i am wrong in this but the tea party seems like a move in that direction in the USA, maybe not directly but definitely in some way. Our people are under serious threat as you know, we may even stop existing as a member of the white race soon .I see the same trend in the USA. The way I see it is that we waited too long to unify our people and inform them about the reality of the situation we found ourselves in. We allowed ourselves to be silenced by the liberal marxisst that ran our country for fear of looking racist when in fact we were just proud of our heritage. I hope it is not too late for you either. Learn from our mistakes and dont miss the opportunity to do so ,we are paying in blood for neglecting our duty to our people. Your situation is more like ours than most Americans seem to realize.</p>

&#8220;The tea party is, for many people, a first step towards activism. It is an absolute certainty that a great many of them are racially aware, just as it is certain that many &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; are really Reds. (snip) The TP is in reality a safe way for Whites to enter the racial struggle, and that&rsquo;s why the leftists worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got it right on, guy.  The leftists are beside themselves with worry, because they know full-well that a huge group of whites uniting under a single purpose could turn racial in a heartbeat, if it is justified for them to do so.  </p>
<p>But the main radical leftist concern is that they have spent much time and effort disuniting whites in order to diminish the white power base so they can render white power null and void, and then along comes a white group who are gaining in numbers and strength each and every day, united once again.  Self-hating whites and racist non-whites are howling frantically.</p>
<p>I think the TP&rsquo;s are very smart in staying away from the race issue&hellip;..for now.</p>
<p>As it has been pointed out on this site many times:  It isn&rsquo;t important that a white group forms with a racial agenda in the beginning, because they will be forced to think in racial terms eventually simply because all non-whites are racist to the core and it is they who dictate the agenda.</p>
<p>The important thing is for whites to UNITE.  Any cause will do for now.  When the situation deteriorates&hellip;as it will without doubt&hellip;the unity is there.  Only the agenda has to be altered slightly.</p>
<p>And, the militias are a VERY IMPORTANT part of white unification even if they STRESS anti-racist aims and purposes for now.  As soon as the threat of attack by non-whites is present, minds will be forced to change immediately.</p>

<p>I think you hit the nail right on the head with that.  A lot of white nationalists poo poo the tea party folks because, well, because they aren&rsquo;t white nationalists.  Many actually hold to the opinion that they are controlled opposition or even just infiltrated and controlled now by our one party with two heads system.</p>
<p>I think they miss the point.  We live under de facto fascism.  Most people know what is going on with regard to this and with regard to race but are afraid to say so openly.  Their fear is justified as there are extreme punishments (even murder) of individuals who express the truth, let alone fight back.  But a curious thing is happening.  Whites are discovering that, even though individuals are vulnerable, groups are not, especially institutions (for example, local and state governments).  Punishment of groups is both limited in scope and effectiveness.  The larger and more institutionalized the group, the harder it is to sanction them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here with the tea party folk is a testing of this phenomenon.  Notice how calling the tea party folks &#8220;racist&#8221; is completely ineffective in breaking them up or disempowering them?  An individual called this could expect to be fired from his job, he and his family threatened, or even jailed (as one NJ teen found out for simply playing a prank at Walmart).  What works for the individual does not work on the group.</p>
<p>Expect whites to start acting more collectively and more open and honest about what is going on and what should be done about it&hellip;..especially if the tea party fails to obtain a political solution to the Obama/Democrat problem.</p>

I am no fool. And like it or not I AM your ally. Those who think America has only one problem - blacks - are the fools. Blacks are just ONE problem America has, and our problems with them have been created and advance primarily by WHITES. It is our own white people who have betrayed and sold us out. All the injustices perpetrated on you by and through blacks were allowed, encouraged and enacted by white &#8216;so-called Americans&rsquo;. But it is foolhardy to ignore all the other problems in this country in the meantime.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got many battles to fight, sir or madam. To ignore all equally important issues we must live with daily such as loss of freedom, unendurably high taxes, deficit spending, attachment to Muslim beliefs, insane immigration chaos, welfare fraud, medical care for illegals, job loss through business exportation to child labor countries, bailouts, takeovers, etc., etc. and ETC.</p>
<p>Tea partiers, just as the rest of the population, come from many walks of life and each may have a different specific area of concern. Just because they don&rsquo;t focus [publicly] on race (which, to their detriment would immediately cause a nationalized complete twisting of the true issues and officially label them a &#8216;racist organization&rsquo;), does not nullify their validity and [hopefully] their potential as a productive group.</p>

<p>These elements trying to take over the Tea Parties, if they haven&rsquo;t already, are the faux right neoconservative wing of the Republican Party.  There&rsquo;s nothing pro-White about them and they serve the same masters as the liberals, same dog doo only wrapped in a different package.

FOX News is giving 24/7 coverage to that airhead, race mixing crypto Sarah Palin while the rest of the MSM is smearing her trying to get the lemmings to unite behind her.

At this point she is unelectable except in the fevered minds of the FOX and Friends crowd.

<p>To settle for &#8220;better than nothing&#8221; is a dangerous thing, and can lead to having &#8220;less than nothing.&#8221; It is tokenism and gives the illusion of solution. It saps efforts that could be better directed.</p>
<p>My White friends, understand that there is no way you will get out of being labeled a &#8220;racist&#8221; or worse once you stand up for your rights. I say let&rsquo;s slap on the arm bands, don the traditional brown shirts and hit the streets in the millions. Then they can scream &#8220;nazi&#8221; all they want without effect. But nothing like it will ever happen. We have become too fearful to act, or, we are not yet desperate enough.</p>
<p>The Tea Party is a best an inchoate farrago, at worst, a sham. Nothing worth mentioning will come of it, just more of the same old same old - vested interests promoting and protecting themselves.</p>

		<p>In reading the article, my thoughts went back to the 1960&rsquo;s, when there was no internet and the news media were newspapers, news magazines, TV, and radio. The Liberals had almost total control over what the American people knew about current events. The Liberals lied, misrepresented, and defamed to their little hearts content. Without the internet medium, the Liberals could make people believe that the innocuous Tea Baggers were neo-Nazis, instead they can only make snide remarks that they are Old, White, and Male. </p>

		<p>I think the tea partiers, while trying to shed the racist label, are in fact de facto racialists, simply because of what they stand for: smaller government, lower taxes.  Government is the single largest employer of black people in America, so a movement that calls for smaller government is, in fact, calling for laying off thousands of black people.  And, as Jesse Jackson said, being against Obamacare is racist, the implication being that the one demographic which would benefit most from government-controlled healthcare would be black people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why the tea parties are such a fascinating barometer of America:  who are the people happiest with big government (i.e., the beneficiaries) and who are the people least pleased with big government (i.e., the people who pay for it).  That we don&rsquo;t see vast crowds of (mostly) black government workers marching to shrink their own payroll and/or entitlement package makes sense, but that we DO see vast crowds of white taxpayers taking to the streets protesting paying those payrolls is, as I say, an interesting statement about the two Americas: not divided between the haves and have-nots, but between the givers and the takers.  The givers have gotten fed up. </p>

		<p>The Tea Party movement is a precursor to a fully articulated white racialist movement. That latter movement - the one that is really needed - will come about in this fashion:</p>
<p>first, Tea Party; that is, continuing mass mobilization of angry, disempowered conservative elements;</p>
<p>second, formation of a Middle American cultural-nationalist movement, which stresses ending or reducing state-encouraged multiculturalist assaults on the nation&rsquo;s (white) heritage, mass immigration, affirmative action preferences, gun controls, welfare and assorted programs which transfer wealth disproportionately from whites to non-whites, etc;</p>
<p>third, transmogrification of Middle American nationalism into a defensive white nationalist movement, a racial-political mass mobilization of whites to demand genuine racial justice, as well as protection (economic as well as physical), for OUR people;</p>
<p>fourth, and finally, the gradual evolution of this WN movement based on fairness into an aggressive and militant WN movement dedicated to the &#8220;reconquest of a continent&#8221;, in tandem with the continually declining quality of life for whites in the US.    </p>

		<p>I was listening to a local Liberal talk show (which I normally do not listen too) and they were talking about the Tea Baggers.  The talk show host was asked why they were angry and none of the Tea Bagger that called into the show had an answer.  They didn&rsquo;t have anything to say to defend their angry and position against the government.  The only thing that came out is that all the Tea Baggers was that they were angry because we had a Black President.  I so embarrassed for the Tea Baggers that call this show.  </p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m tired of seeing skinny, wispy-haired wanna-be beatnicks in sandals and ragged hiking shorts driving a Prius with a bumper sticker that says something like &ldquo;Friends don&rsquo;t let friends vote Republican.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Enough with the narcissistic altruism, that disgusting fakery of supposed good will intended only to put some tree-hugging simpleton with a broken sense of self-esteem in the spotlight.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
You could change the words here and fit in conservative, Christian, white, and have the same hypocrisy working. I could live without a Tea Party, but none of us could live without trees.</p>
<p>It is so easy to poke holes in Republican, conservative logic, no wonder so many do.  Time to get smarter about things.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the point?  Another poster made it.  Race realism cuts across political parties and ideologies, and the quicker some of the more dogmatic who think they are &#8220;it&#8221; figure that out, the more successful the Race Realism movement will be.</p>
<p>As far as taxes go, Republican presidents have set the record for tax increases, not Dems.  EVERY LIGITIMATE CITIZEN PAYS TAXES, even if it is only on gasoline, cigarettes, and beer.  Taxes are everywhere - you can&rsquo;t run a nation without them and you couldn&rsquo;t have our monstrosity of a military, 80% of which is nothing but a socialist party in uniform.  Income tax may need some reform, but what I notice is that the wealthy are real good at whipping simpleton conservatives up so that they won&rsquo;t have to pay a couple percentage point more.  Cry me a river.  What I notice is that these so-called Christians hate seeing the state help out anyone.  They are sooo conceited and narcissistic that they dare everyone to succeed because they did, not recognizing or admitting to the lucky breaks and opportunities that they were able to take advantage of to the detriment of others.  They are non-racial about it too.  I see this as completely seperate from the race issues.  At least some seperation of issues needs to happen in order to clear up the actual system.  If we allowed the poor to get abortions for example, or even made rules about how many children non-income tax paying people could legally have, we might actually control some of our problems.  It is going to take a global approach with ideas like that if we will have any chance of avoiding global catastrophe.</p>
<p>The guy in the sandles with the sticker on his high mileage hybrid is right, to a certain extent.  Belief will not make some problems go away.<br>

&#8220;You need a GOOD REASON to vote Republican? Just remember which party has the most Liberals. And what kind of utter stupidity most liberals cling to&hellip; like multi-culti diversity!&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of liberals in the Republican Party like John McCain, Lindsay Graham, Bill Kristol, the list can go on and on and no lack of multi-cult diversity on the faux right either.  So-called conservatives just love putting some token in a position of power and then swooning over them to prove they&rsquo;re not racist.  Look at Bobby Jindal, Colin Powell and Michael Steele.  I do need a reason to vote Republican although our soon to be Senator (it&rsquo;s practically a shoe in) Rand Paul will get my vote.  I&rsquo;m not voting for the lesser of two evils anymore.  If there&rsquo;s not a Republican candidate that meets my requirements then it&rsquo;s third party.  I don&rsquo;t care if people say I&rsquo;m throwing my vote away it&rsquo;s the principle of the matter.  No more George Bush Republicans!  If the party wants my vote then no more neoconservatism.  <br>

		<p>God bless the tea partiers, but for the sake of historical accuracy, it must be noted that we are talking about a group that is by and large White, aged 35 and up, and until about two years ago didn&rsquo;t really care that much about politics and civic engagement. As long as there was plenty of Miller Lite in the fridge, some stupid sport thug-a-lete event on TV, and the bass boat was running good, most of these people really weren&rsquo;t paying attention to what has been going on in this country for a long time. Now they&rsquo;ve seen their 401Ks and real estate equity wiped out, their credit card balances soar out of control from buying too much stuff made in China at Target, are having a hard time fueling their Expeditions with $2.75 to $4.00 a gallon gas and have lost one or two jobs in their two earner households and abra cadabra, all of the sudden they&rsquo;ve got religion and become constitutional scholars, economists, and historians. You&rsquo;ll also find among their ranks out of work constrction contractors, who until about two years ago were running three and four crews of illegal alien Hispanics all over town doing sheetrock, roofing, concrete finishing, and masonry.</p>

		<p>As a fan of Russian folk and choral music,(but NOT of communism, Marxism, etc.) observing the rise of the Tea Party Movement brings to mind the lyrics of &#8220;The Sacred War.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Great Country is Rising,<br>
Is Rising for the Deadly Battle<br>
Against the Dark Fascist* Forces,<br>
Against their Cursèd Hordes</p>
<p>Chorus:<br>
Let Our Noble Wrath<br>
Seethe like Waves,<br>
We have Peoples&rsquo; War,<br>
A Sacred War!&#8221;</p>
<p>* Insert your own adjective here.<br>

<p>I see your point, but I was trying to get at the fact that I&rsquo;m personally tired of so many people having such a &#8220;Father knows best&#8221; attitude. </p>
<p>I always feel like the guy with the Prius isn&rsquo;t living true to his &#8220;greener&#8221; view of the world - he&rsquo;s using the car to preach to me what a great little camper he is, and what a wretch I am for driving a truck. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same way with the Prius guy&rsquo;s polar opposite, the angry Christian conservative. I&rsquo;m 38 and single, so I&rsquo;m tired of the uncomfortable conversations about how it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s plan for every man and woman to procreate. I hope you get my point.</p>
<p>As for the military, I&rsquo;m assuming with your broadbased &#8220;socialist party in a uniform&#8221; comment that you&rsquo;ve spent time in the military yourself, as that&rsquo;s a dangerously wide comment for a non-military person to make.</p>
<p>I am not a socialist. There was very little socialism on display during my tours in Iraq. At least in the Marine Corps it is very much a meritocracy - the weak get dropped, the wounded get carried, and those who can prove themselves to be reliable and competent (generally) get ahead.  </p>

		<p>Rank-and-file conservatives actually like big government. In 2008, the American National Election Study asked a national sample whether federal spending on 12 different programs should be increased, decreased or kept about the same&hellip;the respondents who identified themselves as &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; or &ldquo;extremely conservative&rdquo; had little appetite for specific spending cuts&hellip;Amazingly, the survey found that, on average, 54 percent of them actually wanted to increase spending.<br>

		<p>Angry, older, white people (who don&rsquo;t spend much time with black people)?</p>
<p>Sounds like typical racists to me!</p>
<p>Thank you CBS News for implying what we are all assuming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tea Party members&#8221; should know that they have no place in a multicultural society like ours.</p>

		<p>To #42:  You&rsquo;re absolutely right.  When you vote for both traditional parties that are doing nothing you want, you are throwing your vote away.  I can&rsquo;t seem to get my truly conservative friends to see that.</p>
