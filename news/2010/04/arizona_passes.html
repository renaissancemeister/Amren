			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Riccardi, Los Angeles Times, April 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona lawmakers on Tuesday approved what foes and supporters agree is the toughest measure in the country against illegal immigrants, directing local police to determine whether people are in the country legally.</p>
<p>The measure, long sought by opponents of illegal immigration, passed 35 to 21 in the state House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The state Senate passed a similar measure earlier this year, and Republican Gov. Jan Brewer is expected to sign the bill.</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s author, State Sen. Russell Pearce, said it simply &#8220;takes the handcuffs off of law enforcement and lets them do their job.&#8221;</p>
<p>But police were deeply divided on the matter, with police unions backing it but the state police chief&rsquo;s association opposing the bill, contending it could erode trust with immigrants who could be potential witnesses.</p>
<p>Immigrant rights groups were horrified, and contended that Arizona would be transformed into a police state.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s beyond the pale,&#8221; said Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. &#8220;It appears to mandate racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill, known as SB 1070, makes it a misdemeanor to lack proper immigration paperwork in Arizona. It also requires police officers, if they form a &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that someone is an illegal immigrant, to determine the person&rsquo;s immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Citizens can sue to compel police agencies to comply with the law, and no city or agency can formulate a policy directing its workers to ignore the law  &mdash;  a provision that advocates say prevents so-called sanctuary orders that police not inquire about people&rsquo;s immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of U.S. citizens are going to be swept up in the application of this law for something as simple as having an accent and leaving their wallet at home,&#8221; said Alessandra Soler Meetze, president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona.</p>
<p>The ACLU and other groups have vowed to sue to block the bill from taking effect should Brewer sign it. They note that a federal court struck down a New Hampshire law in 2005 that said illegal immigrants were trespassing, declaring that only the federal government has the authority to enforce immigration. Another provision of the Arizona law, which makes day laborers illegal, violates the 1st Amendment, critics contend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal immigration brings crime, kidnapping, drugs  &mdash;  drains our government services,&#8221; said Rep. John Kavanagh, a Republican. &#8220;Nobody can stand on the sidelines and not take part in this battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democrats were just as passionate. &#8220;This bill, whether we intend it or not, terrorizes the people we profit from,&#8221; said Rep. Tom Chabin.<br>

								<h2>Anger As Arizona Lawmakers Pass Immigration Bill</h2>
						<p>
							<i>AFP, April 14, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Immigrant rights groups Wednesday slammed Arizona lawmakers after they approved a bill which will allow police officers to determine whether suspects are in the United States legally.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s House of Representatives passed the bill by a margin of 35 votes to 21 during a session on Tuesday, the legislature&rsquo;s website showed, mirroring a similar measure passed by the border state&rsquo;s Senate earlier this year.</p>
<p>The bill will now proceed to Arizona&rsquo;s Republican Governor Jan Brewer to be signed into law.</p>
<p>The bill makes it a misdemeanor offense for an individual to lack proper immigration paperwork and also allows police officers to determine someone&rsquo;s immigration status if they believe he or she could be an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>Currently police can only ask about an individual&rsquo;s immigration status if they are suspected of involvement in another crime.</p>
<p>However critics say the bill will transform Arizona into a &#8220;police state&#8221; and even sections of law enforcement have voiced fears it could harm relations between police and the immigrant community.</p>
<p>Chris Newman, Legal Director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which campaigns on behalf of day laborers in the United States, called on Governor Brewer to veto the bill, which he described as &#8220;odious&#8221; and &#8220;unwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arizona is on the verge of enacting the most anti-immigrant legislation the country has seen in a generation,&#8221; Newman said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are hopeful Governor Brewer will consult with her legal counsel, issue a veto, and spare Arizona the expense of defending an unconstitutional, unwise, and odious bill in federal courts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arizona has long been a laboratory for anti-immigrant experimentation, and its demagogue leaders have become folk heros for white supremacists throughout the United States, but this bill ushers in a new chapter of disgrace for the state that resisted celebrating the life of Martin Luther King.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Let Arizona be a shining symbol of having the honesty and courage to do what is right and perhaps other states will follow. As far as the State Police opposing this, they should be ashamed of themselves as it is quite obvious they just don&rsquo;t want the extra work. This knucklehead Newman has no other defense other than using the race card. They can get as angry as they want, but the law is on our side. As far as leaving your wallet at home, that&rsquo;s bologna because every ten year old knows you don&rsquo;t leave the house without identification. Finally, &#8220;This bill, whether we intend it or not, terrorizes the people we profit from&#8221;. Excuse me Mr.Chabin, but we are not supposed to be profiting from these people. In fact they are not supposed to be here at all.</p>

		<p>If the governor signs the bill into law it will be one that is definitely much needed.  But is it too late to do anything other than crack down on the illegals already in Arizona?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is &#8220;yes,&#8221; we&rsquo;re well beyond the tipping point in this country and fix-it laws that should have been enacted twenty years ago are too little too late.</p>
<p>The empire is too badly damaged to recover.  The community organizer laid the final straw on the camel&rsquo;s back with his pro-black agenda for almost a year and a half now.</p>
<p>The only thing we have any hopes of achieving now is secession and/or voluntary segregation.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s now disgraceful to enact and enforce state anti-immigration laws, even though the Feds won&rsquo;t enforce the immigration laws of the federal &#8220;government&#8221;???  Arizona should have the right to do its part in stemming the tide of illegal aliens within its borders. Of course, the liberals will howl.  Newman refers to this legislation as odious.  I find the invasion across our Southern border to be odious and the federal government&rsquo;s failure to enforce existing immigration laws to be despicable. </p>

		<p>Given the array of rewards Congress and the courts have created to reward those who break in line to enter the United States, that a state is taking such strong action to attempt to curb illegal immigration is good news.</p>
<p>Here are some of the rewards the federal government has created for illegal entry that make it so tough for states to get a handle on the problem:</p>
<p>*citizenship for children born to parents illegally residing in the U.S.,</p>
<p>*free K-12 schooling for children illegally brought to the United States,</p>
<p>*a wink-and-a-nod employee-verification system that currently allows 8 million illegal aliens to hold jobs that could belong to unemployed American citizens,</p>
<p>*free health care at emergency rooms and </p>
<p>*access to welfare programs via children born in the U.S.</p>

<p>What is this &#8220;police state&#8221; business? I notice this phrase is used in both articles without even bothering to define it. Apparently we&rsquo;re all supposed to cringe in horror at the very mention of this phrase. I&rsquo;m sure this was coined in the &rsquo;60s or at least popularized in that era. But I would rather live in a &#8220;police state&#8221; than in a &#8220;lawless state&#8221; or a  &#8220;criminal state&#8221; or a state of dispossion. Wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Secondly I note that both articles contain extensive quotes from leftists saying that the bill is &#8220;horrible.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I live in Arizona and think this bill is great. We are tired of the invasion and the crimes that go with it. The Arizona border has always been a major entry way. But of course this is the last thing Obama and former governor Napolitano want. And with Napolitano now homeland security director and Obama wanting ultimate Democrat votes I&rsquo;m afraid there will be trouble ahead. And all it would take is a liberal judge to overrule it. Not an unlikely scenario. But if it discourages at least some illegals from trying the Arizona border it will be a good thing. </p>

<p>I am utterly disgusted with this all too common argument.  By the same logic, we shouldn&rsquo;t arrest car thieves because that would erode their trust with us when we need information about murderers.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond the pale,&rdquo; said Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. &ldquo;It appears to mandate racial profiling.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Of course this is just an admission that most of the illegal immigrants aren&rsquo;t white.  (No surprise).  By the same argument, we shouldn&rsquo;t arrest crack dealers, as that also mandates &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; (too many of them are black).  Making &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; a sin is one of the most successful scams of the left.  We see racial disparities in every type of crime, so banning &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; amounts to a ban on law enforcement.</p>
<p><i>The ACLU and other groups have vowed to sue to block the bill from taking effect should Brewer sign it.

<p>It&rsquo;s hardly a surprise that the ACLU is going to sue.  They always do everything they can to prevent immigration law from being enforced.  I have the state of Arizona has budgeted plenty of money to fund their defense.  I would like to know why only the federal government is allowed to enforce immigration law.  The Constitution gives the federal government the authority to decided under what circumstances a person can immigrate, obtain citizenship, and so forth.  But if a person isn&rsquo;t here legally under the federal rules, why can&rsquo;t a state enforce the law?</p>

		<p>will someone once and for all tell these stupid, bleeding heart,liberal, commie, marxists, that this is not racial profiling. hispanics are caucasain. the leftists use this accusation to further their agenda. stop them in their tracks. even the government list hispanics as white when it comes to hispanic-on-black crime. but of course this is done to make it look like whites are committing a larger number of hate crimes against blacks. they are listed as hispanic when they are the victim, but are listed as white when they are the perpertrator. also remind them that obama is not black, he is half white and half black.</p>

		<p>Ice, we HAVE to have states passing laws like this.  And if enough do so, and the arrogant and criminal federal government -whether through activist federal judges or through some other means- denies the States their RIGHT to pass laws within their own States in these matters due to the federal government&rsquo;s refusal to perform IT&rsquo;S DUTY according to Constitutional Law, then YOUR goal is achieved.  When the States realize the Federal Government is deaf to their problems, and is in fact CREATING them, and then turns around and through force denies the States their Constitutional rights to protect their citizens and eject the invaders&hellip;.you WILL have secession.  They will be left with no other alternative.</p>

		<p>I hate to be the wet blanket, but as a Californian I have some perspective on this. In 1994 we voted overwhelmingly in favor of Prop. 187, a bill that would cut the illegals off from the public teat. The Feds nullified the popular will. The bill was never allowed to go into effect. Make no mistake my friends, the Feds won&rsquo;t let you do this. The federal government has nothing but contempt for you and your wishes (let alone your children&rsquo;s future). There is a plan in place, and that plan doesn&rsquo;t include Whitey. As far as our government is concerned, Whites are the past, and latinos are the future.  </p>

<p>To that I must comment in kind.  Liberal leftist Marxists have been using the United States and the Western world as their laboratory for race-mixing since modern immigration and the civil rights movement dawned in the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like confining different territorial animals in a cage and watching who gets devoured.  Liberals like Mr. Newman think no more of their fellow citizens than they would of lab rats.</p>

		<p>Having lived in Tucson for 7 years, I can testify that this is long over due.  Mexican nationals drive their smog producing cars and usually have no insurance.  In other words, they had more rights than American citizens who can have their cars towed if they are caught without insurance.  I&rsquo;m sure the usual list of treasonists will emerge, that being, the ACLU, The Southern Poverty Law Center and La Raza.</p>

		<p>As much as I hate to say it, poster #2 is right.  I live in NYC.  Half the city is latino.  One third is black.  One fifth is other, and the rest are white, and a lot of those are recently arrived &#8216;ethnics&rsquo; and not anglo-saxon &#8216;original&rsquo; Americans.</p>
<p>Pretty much the same scenario across the board in nearly all other major population centers.  The tipping point is passed and we are at that wobbly place at the top where it&rsquo;s just about to fall precipitously.</p>
<p>Actions like those in Arizona were taken out of desperation when it was too late.  It&rsquo;s my understanding that the population of Arizona is over 50% Mexican.  Does anyone really believe they can hold back majority rule for long in that state or elsewhere?  </p>
<p>In 20 years, California will be devoid of any white influence and the white libs will be moving into the last remaining white strongholds of the northwest and upper midwest (bringing their poisonous beliefs, by the way).</p>
<p>Obama has already opened the floodgates to Haitians.  George Bush was a secret supporter of unchecked Mexican immigration, keeping with the philosophy of the moneyed classes that slave wages were better than living wages.  From the Clinton era on down we&rsquo;ve have entire communities of burmese, somalians, hmong, etc.. dumped all over small towns across the nation.</p>
<p>100 years from now the north american continent will be like a mini version of the rest of the world.  A little laotian-based state here, little somalia there, little china over there.  Can you imagine the wars that will ensue?  I just wish I could be around to see it, and to be able to wag my finger in the faces of the libs who don&rsquo;t know what kind of disasters they&rsquo;ve wrought!</p>
<p>Even the communists of Stalin or Mao thought they were bringing social justice when they implemented policies that caused TENS of millions to starve to death!</p>
<p>Near the end of the Roman Empire, the Romans tried get tough measures with the Germanic immigrants who were flooding into France and elsewhere.  Too little, too late.  When the German tribes realized the weakness of the state, they rose up and took what they wanted, causing it all to fall.  They didn&rsquo;t care about the beauty of the architecture, literature or the wonders of economic integration.  They just wanted &#8216;goodies&rsquo; now and for their own people, and they got what they wanted.  </p>
<p>Such is our part in the play that we are in the act just before that stage.  Troublis is, the Germans were a people who could build civilizations themselves.  I am not sure that the cripsand thebloods or thechicanos have it in them to make a new civilization 2-3 centuries from now.  God help the earth, because non-whites never do.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that it&rsquo;s taken until now for whites to wake up and take action.  We&rsquo;ve been saying for years to close to borders and stop black militants in their tracks.  No, everyone had to wait for the danger when it is that much harder to correct the situation.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I would like to respectfully suggest that you read up on this history again.  To help along, I have copied this from an online source;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fall of Rome was not from a military siege; it was not from a military defeat; it was over a pay dispute between the young Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, and the general of the palatini, the magister militem in praesenti, by the name of Odoacer. He controlled what has sometimes been referred to as the Palace Guard, but it was much more than that. It was the part of the Field Army, the mobile army of the western Empire, stationed in central Italy, i.e. in and around Rome and Ravenna. </p>
<p><br>
The fall of Rome was also a dispute between two principals: Odoacer, who was a Germanic Ostrogoth, and the Patrician Orestes, the Emperor&rsquo;s father, a Roman from Pannonia. Both Orestes and Odoacer&rsquo;s father, parenthetically, had served in Attila&rsquo;s court before it self-destructed. Legend even has it that the little Odoacer and the littler Romulus were both presented to Attila the Hun, a scene reproduced towards the end of my novel, Attila as Told to His Scribes, (available here as an e-book). https://www.roman-empire-america-now.com/fall-of-rome.html</p>
<p>The fall of Rome might not have happened if the Senate had responded to Orestes&rsquo; appeal, instead of giving in to Odoacer&rsquo;s demands, which is why the presence of a ruling selfish class was fatal. The fall of Rome also illuminates why a state should not depend on mercenaries, especially for troops protecting the capital.&#8221; </p>
<p>Our troops today are largely mercenary in nature because they are paid off.  That is, they join more often for perceived personal benefits and less for patriotic reasons.  Also, in the movement toward privatization, tax payers support private security forces that employ not just US citizens, but foreign born members who have never set foot inside the US border.  I have met American mercenaries several times in my life since 1972, so I know they have long existed, but today, their ranks have greatly expanded.  The author above seems to have written an interesting book.  I just stumbled onto it.  </p>

		<p>I live in a fairly rural part of Ohio and I&rsquo;m seeing more Hispanic faces and hearing more conversations in Spanish.  It&rsquo;s getting ridiculous.  Once I saw a truck in a Wal-Mart parking lot bearing license plates from a Mexican state.</p>
<p>These pro-illegal alien groups are guilty of treason.  I hear Mexico shoots people on sight who are trying to sneak in THEIR country!</p>

		<p>&#8220;When the German tribes realized the weakness of the state, they rose up and took what they wanted, causing it all to fall&#8221;</p>
<p>The big turning point was the fall and sack of Rome 410 AD.  The gates were opened by german and british slaves.</p>
<p>There are many similarities.</p>

		<p>I too live in California.  Prop 187 is a dead letter.  Every welfare office has a pamphlet in many languages expalaining that the welfare department will not and may not ask about immigration status and that immigration status has nothing to do with welfare eligibility.</p>
<p>The feds will knock down this law within 6 months.</p>
<p>And any officer who has a &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that an illegal is an illegal will be sued personally, as a member of his department and will probably lose his job.</p>
<p>Given that law enforcement is well paid, secure and is one of the few occupations with pensions and benefits the officers will avoid being reasonable suspicious that anyone is an illegal alien.</p>
