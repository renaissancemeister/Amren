<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-africa/20100418/AF.Zimbabwe.Anniversary/">Zimbabwe Business Take Overs Stay, Mugabe Pledges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angus Shaw, Comcast News, April 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Robert Mugabe pledged Sunday to move ahead with plans to hand over 51 percent control of businesses to blacks under a controversial program.</p>
<p>During ceremonies Sunday marking the 30th anniversary of independence from colonial rule, Mugabe said the proposed business take overs are a concrete example of policies followed over the last three decades that enable locals to own the nation&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>The so-called indigenization and empowerment act was passed in 2008, when parliament was still dominated by Mugabe&rsquo;s lawmakers. The law came into force on March 1 and all businesses were given to April 15 to hand in proposals as to how they&rsquo;d hand over 51 percent of their company to blacks. This included foreign and white-owned businesses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tsvangirai&rsquo;s party on Wednesday said a meeting of the coalition cabinet chaired by Mugabe suspended the act, which defined &#8220;indigenous&#8221; Zimbabweans as those who suffered under colonial-era racial discrimination and their children born after independence in 1980, effectively excluding the nation&rsquo;s 20,000 whites.</p>
<p>Saviour Kasukwere, a minister from Mugabe&rsquo;s party in charge of empowerment policy, countered this and said Wednesday the law will go ahead, but it had only been delayed for more discussions.</p>
<p>The new so-called indigenization law &#8220;recognizes our sovereign right of ownership,&#8221; Mugabe told crowds at the 50,000 seat Chinese-built sports stadium in Harare.</p>
<p>Mugabe said the nation, governed by a yearlong coalition between his ZANU-PF party and Tsvangirai&rsquo;s Movement for Democratic Change, faced continuing criticism from what he called &#8220;unrepentant and incorrigible racist forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the coalition was proceeding with national reconstruction despite outside opposition from Western countries.</p>
<p>Seizures of white-owned farms and &#8220;now the indigenization program serve as concrete and living examples of empowerment &hellip; designed chiefly to redress the historic imbalances in ownership of the economy,&#8221; Mugabe said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mugabe, 86, acknowledged a need for national healing Sunday &#8220;following a period of polarization and hostilities between our people.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Blacks are the most gifted athletes, the most talented makers of music and the best,by far dancers,but these gifts are offset by their lack of expertise in buisness.That shortcoming  is not their fault, but that of their genes.They are one eighth of the population in the US, but far less than that percentage of the buisness owners and gross buisness revnue. Asians in the US have the opposite pattern.Expecting  them to run buisnesses in Zimbabwe or anywhere else as well as whites, asians, arabs or jews is sheer fantasy.Running a successful buisness means being able to stand on ones fiscal feet, and advancing as well. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Tsvangirai&rsquo;s party on Wednesday said a meeting of the coalition cabinet chaired by Mugabe suspended the act, which defined &#8216;indigenous&rsquo; Zimbabweans as those who suffered under colonial-era racial discrimination and their children born after independence in 1980, effectively excluding the nation&rsquo;s 20,000 whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the above quote, blacks purportedly suffered many deleterious effects from colonialism, and these sufferings supposedly persist today. Thus, Mugabe wants to hand over half of the white-owned businesses to alleviate the so-called sufferings.</p>
<p>There are so many things wrong with that logic that I scarcely know where to begin!</p>
<p>First, did handing over white-owned farms to black people, who obviously couldn&rsquo;t run them, uplift the status of blacks? Quite the contrary: it turned Zimbabwe, a once prosperous food-exporting country, into a starving country in which abject poverty and despair is ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Obviously, handing over half of the white-owned businesses in Zimbabwe to blacks who can&rsquo;t run them will produce the same effect. The economy will sink to an even lower extent if half of all white Zimbabweans are forcefully dispossessed of their businesses.</p>
<p>Second, Mugabe thinks that the reason why black people are poor and why whites are well-off is because of colonialism. We at <i>American Renaissance</i> know better. As a race-realist, I can tell you the real reason for the racial disparity in status: blacks aren&rsquo;t as intelligent, determined and hard-working as whites. The entire premise Mugabe uses to justify dispossessing whites of their farms and businesses is entirely false and contrary to reality.</p>

		<p>sovereign right of ownership</p>
<p><br>
What an interesting term for communism mixed with racism.</p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;the people&#8221; have a right to take, specifically denying the right of those that produce to keep what their labor created, we have &#8220;the black people&#8221; have a right to take.</p>
<p>The implications are predictable and manufactured.  The point of communism was to produce class warfare.  Since the bonds that linked together people were stronger than the artificial bonds of &#8220;class&#8221;, it failed to produce the desired outcome&hellip;war.</p>
<p>But in this case, the bonds of race (which unlike class, is NOT an artificial construct) are very real and very strong.  Instead of class war, the goal here is race war.</p>
<p>I think what everyone should pay attention to here is that the desired outcome is and always has been war.  The very fact that this is the goal is strong warning that we should not give it to them and should, instead, seek to sabotage what is being done through other means.  In realistic terms, that means separation.  You can&rsquo;t have race war if races separate.  And that will only result if light is shined on the fact that what these people want to do is to goad the races into fighting each other.</p>
<p>My point is, they are not the real enemy.  Dangerous and malevolent, yes.  But who pulls the strings behind the scenes?</p>

<p>Mugabe sees an unrepentant and incorrigible racist every time he shaves.  I&rsquo;d be delighted if no other country ever gave Zimbabwe a dime&rsquo;s worth of foreign aid, so that Mugabe and his followers could reap the full benefits of his enlightened rule.  But instead I&rsquo;m sure the majority white countries of the world will hand out more money to Zimbabwe the next time impoverished and hungry Zimbabwean blacks show up on the TV screens.<br>

		<p>I know this sounds hard, but any Whites still living in that dump deserve what they&rsquo;re getting. These White business owners sat back and said NOTHING as their fellow Whites were being brutally murdered and thrown off their land. The ONLY reason they&rsquo;ll allow 49% White ownership is that they need the Whites to acually RUN the business while the 51% black ownership will reap the benefits. What fools!  </p>

<p>One rich guy I talked to about a venture stated simply that &#8220;I get half of all the profits, and you get 100% of all the losses&#8221;.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t half of the profits or half of the losses.  This was supposed to be a partnership, but I didn&rsquo;t like the math.</p>

		<p>&#8220;While the 51% Black ownership will reap the benefits&#8221;<br>
When I was a High School sophomore I stumbled on to the perfect money making scheme. Buying student tickets to football games for 75 cents and then reselling them out side the general admission gate for 3.00. <br>
 Anyone who hadn`t gotten their ticket during the school day would come to me  before the game and  save 1.50 at least, the difference between  a 4.50 General Admmission and my 3.00 student ticket which would grant admission.<br>
  Then a couple of Seniors muscled in and wanted 50% of my thirty to forty dollars a week for nothing more than knowing about the deal and how it worked. I told them that I`d shut the whole program down before I took in a &#8220;partner&#8221; who did nothing more than leach off my idea. When they persisted, that`s exactly what I did do. And I got to say that more than thirty years later, the glow of frustrating a &#8220;takeover&#8221; of my business more than compensated for the lost kid revenue. It was really a defining moment. Refusing to give into blackmail&hellip;.<br>
 When the Seniors restarted my ticket scam on their own, a simple anonymous phone call to the Student Services office initiated a change in procedures  that had them out of business the very next day. I can still see the scowls on their faces at the Pizza Inn as I raised my glass to them.  I hope the good people of South Africa get to experience the satisfaction of thwarting parasites, even at the expense of making a living. As the Mexican peasant told Steve Mc Queen in The Magnificent Seven, &#8220;Now that`s a feeling worth dying for!&#8221;<br>

<p>Doubtless there will be huge demands for the liquor stores and the pop-wine makers, and everybody will want a piece of the Cadillac dealerships. But who will want more mundane businesses that are no fun to loot and pillage.</p>

<p>That is what the Chinese are probably banking all. Once the blacks fail, the Chinese will have it all. Blacks are going to be ruled by someone or the other may it be Whites, Asians, Arabs or Latin Americans. Of all of these, Whites were the ones to treated the blacks best. But thanks to jealousy and greed, they kicked out the Whites and now they are doomed to be the slaves of Arabs, Indians and the Chinese who will treat them worse than animals.</p>

		<p>Just another Black Economic Empowerment &#8220;idea&#8221; that will leave blacks out of work and staving on the streets. Rhodesia was a self-suffienct country with food to feel all its people and its neighbouring states. Now Mugabe just goes from looting the farms to looting the businesses. Nothing will change.</p>
<p>My advice to everyone out there. Don&rsquo;t listen to that Graca Machel. Do not invest a dime in Africa, for it will be nationised in the future. One way or another. You have been warned.</p>
<p>Currently it is the Chinese that keep this maniac in power. The Chinese have a greed that will consume the world one day, of this I am sure. They keep Mugabe in power as he gives them access to &#8220;almost free&#8221; resources. A good deal for them, a bad deal for everyone else, including whites.</p>

Nothing above a primitive tribal existance will ever work long-term. I&rsquo;m certain that if all white money and &#8220;aid&#8221; was stopped tomorrow the whole continent would rapidly regress to its pre-colonial state in 5-10 years tops; along with huge swathes of genocide, famine and chaos. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just going to clumsily throw some information into this conversation regarding this subject.</p>
<p>&#8216;Who is worse: Mugabe or his European paymasters?&rsquo;<br>

<p>&#8216;The Great South African Land Scandal&rsquo;<br>
Blog blurb&hellip;. <br>
&#8220;<b>The racist ANC regime is engineering famine in South Africa.</b> Dr Du Toit describes how the ANC commits systematic genocide against White farmers to steal their land. <b>Absolute power flows not only from the barrel of a gun, but also from the hand which holds the food</b>. Stalin starved 11 Million Ukrainians in 1933, Pol Pot 2 Million in 1975. <b>Mugabe in 2000- is SA next?</b> Read &amp; decide for yourself.&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4kh7yd" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/y4kh7yd</a></p>
<p>Maybe, if you took away all of Southern Africa&rsquo;s mineral wealth, and then removed all of the bleeding heart, Western enabler&rsquo;s aid money.<br>
The brave and industrious White colonists in that part of the world may have had a fighting chance. <br>
A combination of the greedy gold, diamond and oil hungry, manipulating the naively good willed?<br>
{snip}&hellip;.<i>&rdquo;Mugabe told crowds at the 50,000 seat <b>Chinese-built</b> sports stadium in Harare.&rdquo;</i><br>
I wonder if those Chinese businesses will be included in Mugabe&rsquo;s &lsquo;indigenization law&rsquo; asset grab?<br>
Upon further reading of this article&hellip;..<br>
{snip}&hellip;.<i>&rdquo;which defined &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; Zimbabweans as those who suffered under colonial-era racial discrimination.&rdquo;</i><br>
I&rsquo;m guessing as probably not as the Chinese will now be officially &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; Zimbabweans, lucky them!</p>
<p>When the White colonists found Rhodesia, there was noting there but inhospitable land and very, very few people.<br>
Now the descendants of those who built that very land into a nation, have zero claim to any sovereign rights there?</p>
<p>To the greedy and self-serving, which push the hate filled, blatantly anti White agenda in Africa, at least they have a tangible motive. <br>
To the Western aid enablers, who are just blind and only see what they want to see, which is <i>the fairytale</i>. <br>
Ultimately at the end of the day, they (both the greedy rich and the stupidly naïve) have the same White (and black) blood on their hands.<br>
