<h1>Why So Few Blacks Among Tea Partyers [<em>sic</em>]?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rod Watson, Buffalo News, April 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I went to my first &#8220;tea party&#8221; last week. I&rsquo;ve never been that lonely in a crowd before. Seeing only one other African-American among 100 or so people in the Wheatfield Community Center, I have to admit I felt like &hellip; well &hellip; like a black guy at a tea party. </p>
<p>The turnout left me wondering why the movement seems to attract so few African-Americans. Once you get past one obvious answer  &mdash;  TV footage of crazies and disputed reports of black congressmen dodging spittle  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s still an undeniable fact: Blacks complain about government, taxes and lousy services just like everybody else. </p>
<p>But even if everyone loves a party, blacks are skipping this one. A Quinnipiac University poll had 7 percent of both blacks and Hispanics saying they are tea partyers [<em>sic</em>]. Yet you&rsquo;d strain your eyes trying to find them at last week&rsquo;s Niagara Patriots meeting or among the 250 at a Buffalo rally last weekend. </p>
<p>Local organizer Rus Thompson says the turnouts were not entirely reflective. He says there are two or three blacks among the 15 or so at leadership meetings, and some events draw more. </p>
<p>&#8220;I do want to see more,&#8221; Thompson said, ticking off issues like lousy urban schools and the state&rsquo;s cap on charter schools, which directly impact blacks and Hispanics. He blames political opponents for media coverage that paints tea partyers as racists. </p>
<p>But if the movement is serious about attracting blacks, it&rsquo;s also going to have to check its own rhetoric. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But rhetoric aside, maybe this is a circle that can&rsquo;t be squared. </p>
<p>Samuel L. Radford III, co-chairman of the Buffalo Local Action Committee, turns to etymology to explain the tea party movement&rsquo;s racial homogeneity and why it&rsquo;s not likely to change: Conservatives, by definition, want to conserve what they have. </p>
<p>&#8220;As the door opens for more people to take part in the American dream &hellip; that means less for them, or that it&rsquo;s going to cost them more,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>As Democrats enact reforms like health care and a jobs bill, it gives more of the dispossessed  &mdash;  particularly minorities  &mdash;  a vested interest in political participation. That will &#8220;change everything,&#8221; Radford said, to the consternation of those who like things the way they used to be. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also one other factor: For many blacks, government may be evil; but compared with the rest of society, it&rsquo;s the lesser of two evils. It&rsquo;s easy to see an attack on government as an attack on the equality that government had to mandate and often still must enforce. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Center-right movements have traditionally turned out badly for African-Americans. You can&rsquo;t deny history,&#8221; Radford said. </p>
<p>Which leaves tea partyers with a choice: They can actively reach out and rewrite history, as Thompson seems to want to do, or they can repeat it.<br>

		<p>Blacks do not attend Tea Party gatherings for one very simple fact:  black by and large are the largest (non-corporate) receivers of government transfer payments, entitlement programs and affirmative action.  The National Health &#8220;Care&#8221; scheme just signed into law will morph, over time, into a nationwide version of Medicaid.  Medicaid is the &#8220;insurance plan&#8221; of choice for black Americans.  They feel that this latest in a long line of wealth transfer plans will benefit them the most.  So of course they do not support the Tea Party movement.  They LOVE the nanny state.</p>

		<p>As a tea partier I think I can best answer the question as to why there are few blacks in the movement.  First of all blacks concentrate almost specifically on race and look at everything through the prism of race.  The tea partiers are concerned about the country as a whole and its future, plus they value traditional American values which most blacks look on as being too capitalistic, because they require work, ability and intelligence.</p>
<p>Blacks do not have the best interests of America, as a whole, at heart.  They have little concern for anything or anybody outside their own race and issues that affect their race.</p>
<p>If the country is going downhill rapidly, blacks don&rsquo;t really care so long as they perceive the deterioration to be beneficial to themselves, which they do, because they want a system of government closer to communism.  A Marxist regime would enable them to acquire assets and obtain positions based on quotas rather than merit.</p>
<p>The tea party ideology is the antithesis to the black Marxist ideal.  Blacks prefer the Cuban system to the American one.  </p>
<p>So, therein, in a nutshell is why blacks can&rsquo;t be found at tea party rallies.</p>
<p>Actaully, as usual, the question should not be debatated as to why there are not more blacks at tea party rallies, but what should be discussed is why blacks reject the principles this nation was founded on and why they do not like to take more responsibility in their lives.</p>
<p>Blacks have no place in a society where a person succeeds on his own merit.  They&rsquo;ve tried that for decades and they just can&rsquo;t seem to succeed.  Most blacks really should relocate to Cuba or Africa in order to influence the systems in those areas, because they are closer to what they want right now.</p>
<p>And, Obama is trying his best to change the entire country to fit the black ideal, because he&rsquo;s aware they&rsquo;ll never succeed in a capitalistic society.  That&rsquo;s the reason he wants to &#8220;fundementally change the entire system.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s no other reason.</p>

		<p>Another technique that the Left uses:</p>
<p>Once an event is &#8220;established&#8221; (even though it did not happen), continually link to it and build on it, whether it actually happened or not.</p>
<p>Nobody spat, nobody called out a racial epithet at the protest in Washington, before America became socialist.</p>
<p>But the Left keeps repeating it, and linking to it.</p>
<p>Just like the flying saucer &#8220;contactees.&#8221; Just keep refering to George Adamski and others. Link to their narratives. Build on them. No matter that they were all a bunch of wackos.</p>
<p>The Left is a house built on sand. And they want us to think that Christianity is built on sand, and that Europe is built on that. Well, I am finding out a few things.</p>

		<p>Everything is open to blacks.  That they don&rsquo;t go is a reflection of their dislikes, attitudes or their lack of incentive.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it curious that this black can&rsquo;t seem to draw any interest in things other than race?</p>
<p>Blacks everywhere are consumed with race in everything they do, everywhere they go and everything they say.</p>
<p>Too, this one here, like all the rest, seems to be saying that the tea party crowd must adjust their ideology to be more acceptable to blacks, afterwhich they should go out and beg blacks to attend to give them credibility.</p>
<p>Like most blacks, he doesn&rsquo;t come across as overly bright.  Instead of whining about everything, he should be glad he&rsquo;s paid to write a column strictly because he&rsquo;s black, because his ability and subject matter is dull and boring.  If he were white he wouldn&rsquo;t have a job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to admit I felt like &hellip; well &hellip; like a black guy at a tea party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main reason he felt lonely and isolated was not because he was black, rather it was the fact that he was a radical, white hating leftist at a basically white conservative gathering. </p>
<p>Pure crocodile tears.  <br>

		<p>By attending this Tea Party event, what Mr. Watson wanted was to provoke racial taunts and hate. Being in the company of the crypto-K, Mr. Watson was sure his life was going to be in danger of being harassed or maybe even lynched.</p>
<p>To his utter amazement, nothing happened. All he saw was angry white people and he doesn&rsquo;t understand why they&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>These Tea Party events have been decried as &#8216;racist&rsquo; because they&rsquo;re largely white. Too many whites gathered in once place without visible minorities = overt racism.</p>
<p>The reason these events are largely white is because it&rsquo;s the white middle class that is over taxed. They are the ones protesting. Blacks aren&rsquo;t protesting because blacks aren&rsquo;t being over taxed. Blacks are free to join these tax protest any time they want but they don&rsquo;t because over taxation isn&rsquo;t affecting them.</p>
<p>The real problem as blacks see it is not that whites are over taxed, it&rsquo;s that whites aren&rsquo;t being taxed enough.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all very simple.  Government promises to take stuff from one group of people and give it to another group.  Sometimes the stuff transferred is astonishing, like the $160 billion bailout sent to AIG so that Barclays and Goldman Sachs wouldn&rsquo;t have to resort to picking over AIG&rsquo;s carcass in the bankruptcy courts.</p>
<p>But the steady, year by year transfer is from the mostly white middle class to the mostly black and Hispanic welfare class.  (Social security and Medicare are larger transfers but most of us expect to get old someday so don&rsquo;t object to those programs.)  Naturally blacks favor the transfer of resources from white people to themselves, and whites are resentful of it.  I see no reason why white people should feel any need to apologize for not wanting their government to play Robin Hood.<br>

Just the name &#8220;tea party&#8221; has a european white ring to it. Therefore, they see it as a form of white identity, so most blacks could care less. The tea parties want what is best for America, they want what&rsquo;s best for them- America be damned.</p>
<p> But it&rsquo;s really the same old story because the same could be said for other things &#8220;white&#8221; like dog shows, equestrian events, nature, nude beaches and things like that.</p>

<p>I think your first line is especially apt.  Mr. Watson, along with the fool anarchist that wrote the screed that AR featured today, these leftist types (white and non-white alike) work themselves into a paranoid delusion about the power of their enemies.  And they have a simple motivation to do so   &mdash;   Most people don&rsquo;t have the capability to climb Mt. Everest.  But if you fool yourself into thinking that the mole hill in your local city park is Mt. Everest, then of course you think you actually scaled &#8220;Everest.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Mr. Wilson will now congratulate himself for having the courage to face down what in five to ten years, according to his telling, will be a linch mob of angry K-people armed with A.K.s in one hand and burning crucifixes in the other hand, and come out alive and in one piece.  Likewise, the neo-communist cabal that intimidated one D.C. hotel after another with death threats if they held the AR conference in February actually does think that it won a great victory against the capitalist mega-plutocracy, because they think Jared Taylor and AR (and all of us) are the tools of the mega-plutocrats.  </p>

<p>Funny, I doubt that 7 year old black girls were being gang-raped in pre-Civil War America. So, why would the people in favor of such a government and way of life (i.e. Constitutionalists) be a threat to blacks rather than a badly-needed form of protection from the evils in the hearts of men?</p>
<p>Modern black communities = terrible suffering for black people. All criminals should be dealt with appropriately in order to prevent said criminals from further infringing upon the rights of their fellow men. Snitching = keeping your family from being murdered by drug pushers. Staying quiet = you being dead/enslaved. </p>
<p>Oh and (liberal) dictators never overlook any race, religion, ethnicity, etc. They may come for us first, but you are most assuredly next. We have mercy, they have none.</p>

		<p>The few blacks at any majority White event are there as spies to record a White saying something racist that can then be reported and used to scare away moderate Whites from future events.   Nobody can withstand being called a racist or of being associated with racists.   Whites have enough trouble with spies in our own ranks, so there is no reason to suspend instinct when encountering a black by assuming someone from a foreign tribe isn&rsquo;t automatically a spy. Never give them the benefit of the doubt. They all profit from race racket shakedowns and Diversity Action. </p>

If anyone is inclined, you can read the comments at the link. Presently, they total 230. You may want to act quickly because the Buffalo News has the annoying habit of deleting and disabling comments when the discussion gets heated.</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, blacks couldn&rsquo;t care less so long as they have that welfare check.  The country could go to hell in a handbasket (already on the way there, full speed), but they better have money on their First of the Month holiday!</p>

		<p>It takes serious impulse control to be self sufficient.  Certain races have more of it than others and do better when competing against others.</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics have higher proportions of underperformers in their populations so they want handouts.  The Tea Party is not in the business of handouts.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t worry Lefties.  With the likes of the Neo-Cons taking it over it will be spun into something counter to it&rsquo;s original ideals that will not challenge the welfare state.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m going down to the next Tea Party close to me to see if any anti-taxers are still there.  I hope so.</p>

<p>First off this is an oxymoron statement. He be hyphenated, and if he wants to be African, then by all means there are plenty of 3rd world squalor in sub-Sahara Africa to got back too. Nothing has ever come out of Sub-Sahara Africa to write home about since the 1980&rsquo;s. Just look at South Africa and what use to be Rhodesia. Is this what they want? </p>

		<p>Blacks are welcome at Tea Parties - but they aren&rsquo;t going to get engraved invitations.  They&rsquo;re going to be treated exactly like their white counterparts, which is what true equality means.  If they expect the Tea Party folks to pander to their demands, they need to go elsewhere and find a Massa who&rsquo;s willing to give freebies into their outstretched palms.  If blacks want equality, then show up and become part of instead of whining about repeating history.  In fact, if they learned their history, they would know that they were freed in 1865 and were never promised special anything then or now.</p>

		<p>Notice the author&rsquo;s use of the term &#8220;the dispossessed&#8221;.  His choice of this particular imagery helps convince the reader that minorities have somehow had political power TAKEN from them, instead of acknowledging that in majority-rule voting situations minorities are typically out of luck.</p>
<p>Such language clouds the issue, and stops the vast majority of our people from ever bothering to rub 2 neurons together to think about how things will be when WE are the minorities.</p>
<p>When that day comes, will people think about the power that has been stolen from us through government demographic treachery, and refer to Whites as &#8220;the dispossessed&#8221;?  Don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>

<p>Who did 94-98% of BLACKS vote for in the last election, and WHY did they vote thusly?<br>
BECAUSE OF RACE. The Blacks voted the &#8216;the black guy&rsquo; -even if he is only 49% black.</p>

		<p>The left cannot produce any logical basis for why white taxpayers should support leftist policy so they are forced to use their only argument that is not allowed to be challenged (RACISM).  A simple mention of racism is enough to send a conservative backpedaling in any argument in the mainstream world.  The left wants to establish a zero tolerance policy to disagreement with leftist principles on race.  I would say they are now very successful.  The only thing that will change this sleepy descent into the maelstrom is if we whites loose our comfortable lives in front of netflix and the couch and are forced into the uncomfortable reality of our world.  </p>

		<p>What if it was some kind of white consciousness movement (one that is sorely needed, I might add)? His reaction is like the opposite of the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement - one where the white reporter has only sympathetic things to say and has to be &#8216;down&rsquo; with the movement - anything else would be hatred. Of course the white reporter can never completely disown his whiteness (sin I suppose - as opposed to the noble and morally superior) but he can try. Isn&rsquo;t that how it always works? The last 60 years have been about being as racist towards whites as possible and calling it &#8216;enlightenment&rsquo; and consciousness raising. People around the world do believe racism is a powerful force, but mostly it&rsquo;s our leadership at home we have to worry about. It&rsquo;s funny that reactionary blogs like AmRen&rsquo;s are the ones that are hated on and condemned. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just for noticing.  </p>

		<p>I would hope this &#8220;columnist&#8221; is merely pretending to be puzzled by the lack of black participation in the so-called tea party movement.</p>
<p>When blacks as a group voted 93% for the present occupant of the White House, and clearly would do so again, one wouldn&rsquo;t expect to find many of them at a movement calling for more limited government and less redistribution.</p>
<p>Blacks are a dependent group, seeking to benefit from the labor of others.  Government, and particularly the Democrat Party, is their source of spoils, pure and simple.  They&rsquo;re not about to oppose the force that commits their plunder for them.</p>

		<p>Mr. Watson implies that so few blacks go to the tea party rallies because they have heard about the &#8220;spittle&#8221; stories, etc. I want to remind Mr. Watson that the alleged &#8220;spittle&#8221; story is of recent vintage, and blacks have been avoiding the tea party rallies for, well, forever. Try again Mr. Watson. BTW, if &#8220;spittle&#8221; even happened it was inadvertent, not purposeful. Review the tape. The protester was yelling vigorously. The leftest commentator, Chris Matthews, is famous for inadvertently spitting on people when he interviews them and gets a little rowdy. </p>

		<p>I can only add to what others have already said: the vast majority of blacks go with race. Period. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of Senator Brown&rsquo;s election in Massachusetts, some of the supposed &#8220;experts&#8221; commented on the relatively low turnout found in the black community. They linked it to other instances where black voter turnout was low - New York and Virginia for instance. </p>
<p>They proffered all sorts of pseudo-intellectual theories, as though the black community, en masse, was lurking about with a variety of big-picture strategies in mind. </p>
<p>In reality, there was huge black turnout during the Obama election because&hellip;Obama was black. Now that the black community sees a &#8220;brutha&#8221; in the White House they&rsquo;ve gone back to their &#8220;Couldn&rsquo;t care less&#8221; approach to the daily business of the country. </p>

		<p>Somehow I get the impression that this black bigot would erupt into a Jeremiah Wright look-a-like if he were challenged to the point of angering him. I get the impression he would have all the same vitriole, the same anti-white hate, and make the same baseless crybaby complaints as old Jeremiah who is steeped in one of the most racist, vile ideologies on the planet today, which is Black Theology.</p>
<p>But beneath it all there is much to see as well.  It&rsquo;s plain he harps on inequality, injustice and partisan innuendos strictly for the purpose of trying to water down a movement that is too white for his tastes.  He uses the same tactic old Jesse and Al use, which is to bring to bear on any display of white unity critical theory which is a ploy to demonize this white group for the purpose of neutralizing them, and hopefully he wants to place them in a position to where they are constantly defending evcerything they do and say.  He wants to badger them into submission.</p>
<p>But these aren&rsquo;t his ideas.  He&rsquo;s not bright enough to have developed such a strategy, no more than Jesse or Al.  He has been taught these tactics from the playbook of the extremist radical Saul Alinsky and the likes of the Frankfor School bunch who first introduced critical theory as a ploy to bring down Western Society.</p>
<p>This man is a typical example of why blacks shouldn&rsquo;t be afforded affirmative action positions.  He has been given a chance to enter the public debate, through the grace of foolish whites,  but instead of contributing worthwhile suggestions in a fair and unbiased manner he slinks to the level of the same unethical conduct all black demagogues use to try to get whitey to give them something for nothing, because they know full well blacks can&rsquo;t earn anything on their own.  </p>

Mr. Rod Watson of the Buffalo News says he can&rsquo;t understand why the TEA Parties are so white. </p>
<p>Elementary, my dear Watson: The solution to the mystery is right there in the movement&rsquo;s name. &#8220;TEA,&#8221; you see, stands for &#8220;Taxed Enough Already.&#8221; </p>
<p>Whites are net payers of taxes: they contribute more than they receive. </p>
<p>Blacks are net consumers of taxes: they receive more than they contribute. </p>
<p>Ergo, blacks do not join the TEA Party movement because limiting taxes for whites means limiting gubmint freebies for blacks. The present set-up is in blacks&rsquo; favor, and they&rsquo;d prefer to keep it that way. </p>
<p>Blacks and whites are generally understood to have differing priorities and motivations: even liberals occasionally admit this. But when it comes to the hot-button issue of taxation-for-redistribution, the group interests of blacks and whites not only differ but are <i>irreconcilable</i>. Our group interests and theirs are DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED. What&rsquo;s good for them is bad for us; and vice versa. </p>
<p>Which BTW answers not only Rod Watson&rsquo;s question but also Rodney King&rsquo;s: No, we CAN&rsquo;T all just get along. </p>

		<p>Of course blacks are not at tea parties.  They are the beneficiaries of the Robin Hook tax-and-redistribute socialist programs being implemented.  Even setting race aside, you can&rsquo;t expect a rational person to oppose a program that gives him free housing, food, medical care, and other benefits.  When you factor in the racial aspect   &mdash;   the sense of entitlement that blacks feel due to their so-called &#8220;oppressed&#8221; status   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s a no-brainer that they&rsquo;re not rallying in the streets for lower taxes and spending cuts.</p>

		<p>Why won&rsquo;t someone in the MSM make the obvious logical conclusion.  Let&rsquo;s assume the obvious that the tea partiers are strongly concerned with fiscal discipline within government and that they are so concerned they have chosen to get vocal about it and organize politically.   Since the tea partiers are mostly white,it can be derived that white people tend to be far more concerned with fiscal discipline than blacks   &mdash;   at least not enough to the extent that they are going to organize and get vocal about it. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious to anyone in the real world that the reason there are few black tea partiers is b/c blacks generally don&rsquo;t care about fiscal discipline and runaway government spending.   The MSM tries to hide this fact by throwing a smokescreen out there saying the tea partiers are racists   &mdash;   rather than admit the truth that the tea partiers tend to be white b/c it is white people who tend to care about unrestrained government spending and most blacks could care less.  </p>

		<p><i>There&rsquo;s also one other factor: For many blacks, government may be evil; but compared with the rest of society, it&rsquo;s the lesser of two evils.

<p>There is something being missed here, which is in the statement above. Blacks don&rsquo;t want government with fewer powers, especially one where the &#8220;&hellip;equality that goverment had to mandate&hellip;&#8221;, i.e. affirmative action and quota policies in business, goverment and academia (of course this is not &#8220;equality&#8221;, but blatant preference for a failed group of people over ones who can succeed on their own.) This is on top of all the comments about the other wealth redistribution (welfare, etc.) schemes of the goverments (state and federal) of these (dis-)United States.</p>
<p>This part of the quote just caught my attention even more than at first: &#8220;For many blacks, government may be evil; but compared with the rest of society, it&rsquo;s the lesser of two evils.&#8221;  So goverment is evil in the eyes of blacks, but &#8220;the rest of society&#8221; is even worse? I suspect that &#8220;the rest of society&#8221; is referring to whites, who are so evil they actually pay for most of the welfare goodies that blacks receive? If so, this sounds like the attitude of a spoiled child more than one of an adult. No wonder whites are getting tired of paying for the welfare state&hellip;there isn&rsquo;t even a hint of gratitude amongst the recipients these days (I wonder whether there ever was, or was the attitude always one of entitlement?)</p>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, blacks couldn&rsquo;t care less so long as they have that welfare check. The country could go to hell in a hand basket (already on the way there, full speed), but they better have money on their First of the Month holiday!&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexandra hits a home run, here. I remember a number of years ago, when Bush and Cheney and these neo-cons were in the process of lying us into the war in Iraq, I was having a conversation about it with a black guy (in his mid-50s) at work about it.   Evidence was appearing all over the internet news sites that showed that they had lied, and I was attempting to reach the black guy - who was also opposed to the war - on a moral basis, and explain that it was a terrible crime to kill all those innocent people and to do so, based on deliberate lies and deceit.    Try though I did, I could only get the black guy to confess that he thought the war was wrong because of the millions of dollars of tax payer&rsquo;s money that it was wasting. He just could not grasp the immorality angle.   </p>
<p>I was forced to conclude that his concerns for the cost of the war was somehow related to his preference to see that money spent on social entitlements of various kinds, all of which always seem to benefit minorities and which are almost always paid for by white middle class people.  </p>
<p>So, as Alexandra said - our country is going to hell in a hand basket, but minorities could care less - as long as they get their goodies until the eventual time arrives where the whole nation implodes.</p>
<p>One other observation.  I notice that several posters mentioned that blacks see the world through a prism of racial identity and make their decisions based on what they perceive to be in the best interests of their ethnic group.   These posters appear to be insinuating that this method of seeing the world is somehow flawed.   I wholeheartedly disagree.   If it were not for the pathetically cowardly ease with which our controlled mainstream media have succeeded in demonizing any sort of white racial pride and white racial awareness - which undermines white racial solidarity - whites in America, and in every other European white majority nation, would not be in the miserable shape we are today, where we are watching hordes of race conscious, extremely aggressive non-whites from the Third World flooding into our nations and basically telling us that they intend to take over.</p>
<p>The primary problem with a given ethnic group viewing the world through a prism of racial identity is that the paradigm for this otherwise healthy behavior is out of focus.   Right now, the least productive and most parasitical minded ethnic groups use this tactic - while the more productive and most self-sufficient ethnic group has been brainwashed to not do so.  This is a recipe for the genocide of European people and we need to fix it.<br>

		<p>I should address this to Chris Matthews and other whites that are so concerned about the few blacks in the Tea Party movement and even the Republican Party.<br>
Blacks are 12/13 percent of the population. If you also add in the education level and the criminal level  and how blacks are 90% plus vote democrat,  How many blacks do you think should be there. Well I guess according to Matthews and other white guilters it should be 50%.<br>
Here is another fact disapproving of the big lie from the left. At the national republican convention it is always stated how few blacks are there. But for the past 3 conventions there were roughly 7% blacks at the republican convention but at the democratic convention it was 26% black. Which proves that the republicans not the democrats are showing the &ldquo;true face&rdquo; of America.<br>

		<p>I remember many years back here in CT when fat slob Jabba the Hut Lowell Weicker was Governor and was trying to pass a state income tax. The good people of Connecticut said &#8220;no way&#8221; and we all went to a gigantic rally at the state capitol to protest. Guess what!  there were no blacks there! Some of us got real thirsty from jumping up and down yelling and screaming and decided to hit main street in Hartford looking for a good watering hole and there were plenty of blacks there walking around saying they want no part of the protest and that a state income tax would mean more money for their welfare checks and give-away programs, &#8220;let the stupid white folk pay for it all&#8221;.<br>
    Needless to say dictator fat slob Weicker passed the income tax and said &#8220;I&rsquo;m the Governor and I&rsquo;ll do what I please&#8221; despite the protest of the tax payers.  <br>
    So like so many other posters have already said the main reason blacks are not part of the &#8220;tea-party&#8221; is because it&rsquo;s not in their best interest to do so and what could be better than having &#8220;evil whitey&#8221; pay for us to have a good time while they work their buts off as slaves.  The blacks always bitch and moan about slavery and reparations but it&rsquo;s whites that are now slaves and we have been paying reparations for the last 100 years.
