			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenna Ross, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), April 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More minority students are applying to Hamline University Law School. Acceptances are up, too. But overall diversity? Down a tick from a decade ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hamline&rsquo;s struggle is common. Law schools across the nation vie for students of color to diversify classrooms  &mdash;  and ultimately, courtrooms. Greater diversity will lead to a fairer legal system, they say, and clients demand it.</p>
<p>Yet growth is slow, and, as a recent study shows, representation of some races has even dropped.</p>
<p>That has law schools and law firms working in high schools, preparing undergraduates and launching new admissions programs. Starting April 15, the University of St. Thomas School of Law will accept some students without LSAT scores, which, statistics show, are generally higher for whites than minorities. Other schools are considering similar steps.</p>

<p>AA lawyers are too numerous throughout the country already, but I would rather deal with an AA lawyer who can be trounced than an AA doctor who could well kill somebody with his/her incompetence.</p>
<p>Per The Bell Curve diagram, blacks are but a wee number up around about 120, then peter out altogether about 122, if I&rsquo;m reading it correctly.  Since it is accepted belief that an effective lawyer needs a MINIMUM 115 I.Q. average, there are a LOT of blacks who are getting confirmed that are dumbing down the profession.</p>

		<p>I am a law school graduate.  The blacks attending my school received  &mdash;  in all instances that I&rsquo;m aware of  &mdash;  full tuition scholarships to attend.  Money that may have been used to offer 1/3rd tuition scholarships to three people, was instead used to offer people with sub-standard entrance qualifications free tuition.  I&rsquo;ll never donate a dime to any university I attended for this reason (among others).  </p>
<p>The reasons that those particular law schools mentioned are likely struggling to attract black students is because any black candidate with any talent will be offered a full-tuition scholarship to attend a much higher regarded law school (such as the school I attended).  Hamline and St. Thomas are not well regarded law schools.  Even my law school, ranked in the top 25, struggled to find blacks who could be minimally competitive, since the tiny group of blacks with the IQ&rsquo;s and work ethic necessary to succeed in law school  &mdash;  often blacks from overseas  &mdash;  are fought over by all the top schools, without enough talent to go around.<br>

That&rsquo;s absolutely laughable!  I sat in state court for twenty years as a clerk at both the common pleas and jury trial court level and can well remember most of the local criminal defense attorneys over that time span who were on the court appointed defense roster (for &#8220;indigent&#8221; defendants). And I can remember arraignments and first appearances when these frequent flyer bozo thugs and never-do-wells got their free court appointed attorneys. Almost invariably, black defendants (60% of total defendants in a county that is 12% Black) would moan, grimace, and even beg the presiding first appearance judge for another attorney whenever a black attorney&rsquo;s number came up on the rotating roster.</p>

		<p>This article really hits home, since I am just finishing applying to law school.  In the age of the internet, the blatant anti-white discrimination that occurs in law school admissions is open for all to see.  I encourage you to visit the following website where law school applicants voluntarily share their GPA and LSAT scores, as well as the results of their admissions process:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lawschoolnumbers.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.lawschoolnumbers.com/</a></p>
<p>Click on any one of the &#8220;Top 14&#8221; schools on the bottom right of the home page, and then click on &#8220;Graphs.&#8221;  Now find the green dots that are on the left-most side of the graph.  These are, objectively speaking, the least-qualified students to be admitted to these elite law schools.  They have the lowest GPAs and LSATS of any other students admitted to the same school.  Hover your cursor over these green dots, and you will see the following in every case: URM (underrepresented minority).</p>
<p>For instance, there is a &#8220;URM&#8221; who was admitted to the University of Virginia with a 3.02 GPA and a 160 LSAT.  You can find a &#8220;URM&#8221; admitted to Duke with a 153 LSAT.  The median LSAT score for those admitted to Duke is 168!  Needless to say, admissions committees from both these schools would laugh at me if I applied to them with similar numbers.  </p>
<p>I am happy to be going to a tier 1 law school, but I will find it hard to take my &#8220;URM&#8221; classmates seriously after seeing the break they get in admissions.</p>

<p>Greater diversity will lead to a fairer legal system??? THEY say?? Just how will adding more minorities to law schools (and by default, less Whites) make the legal system FAIRER?? IS the writer saying justice isnt served fairly if the system has too many Whites? That Whites are inherently racist??</p>
<p>&#8220;Some law schools admitting non-whites without LSAT scores.&#8221;</p>
<p>And free or reduced rides through law school IF your skin isnt White? Why are there not thousands of discrimination suits filed by Whites who have been wronged by this crooked and racist system? The way to end this ANTI WHITE nonsense is to hit them in the wallet. HARD!!!!</p>

		<p>If we survive as a species, historians will write of the period 1950-20&hellip;?? as a time when the richest and most powerful country on earth wasted enormous resources trying to alter the most obvious and undeniable fact about human society: </p>
<p>People whose ancestors come from preliterate societies are less intelligent on average than those from literate ones. </p>
<p>Everyone knows that blacks with money have white doctors, lawyers, but also financial advisers, architects, pilots, etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>Race realists often feel like an embattled minority, but speaking as a lifelong race denier, we must remember at all times that everyone has always known the truth about race and intelligence, that proponents of AA, disparate impact, etc. are deliberately and consciously lying every minute of the day.</p>
<p>Blacks did not ask to be thrust into a society for which they were unprepared in evolutionary terms, we did that to them, they are just trying to square the circle, and it isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Needed is not just blunt truths about race and IQ, but a workable alternative to the AA madness which will involve negotiation and compromise. </p>

<p>What we have is a tiny pool which is never going to expand so the competition for spots will always be competitive.</p>
<p>One way in which diversity may play a role in our criminal system is that verdicts can be set aside or overturned because of incompetent representation.<br>

<p>BINGO Sir. You answered the $64 question. I&rsquo;ve been saying that for a long, long time.</p>
<p>When they were slaves, they had value. But once slavery ended, their value declined, especially with the advent of machinery. The Jim Crow era masked the idea that they weren&rsquo;t up to the society. Everything was shrouded in the idea that they were oppressed. But their seeming &#8220;oppression&#8221; was actually a way of helping them build whatever society of their own they could. Actually, they did accomplish that to a certain extent. Once the forces who were against America achieved integration, they knew they couldn&rsquo;t stop there because it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for White people to realize that blacks just weren&rsquo;t up to living here. So they went about dumbing down the society and setting up this web of illusion we live in today. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for black people, they&rsquo;ll get the short end of the stick once again as soon as the White people finally wake up and take reasonable action against them. This was never the blacks fault. They were, and remain dupes. </p>

<p>***</p>
<p>Unless the courts simply find a disparate impact shown by the bar exam&rsquo;s cumulative results. Blacks drag the bar down, plain and simple, and with disparate laws in place we are doomed.</p>
<p>The StarTribune loves to plaster its pages with diversity, that goes without saying. However, it always strikes me as funny when they also plaster school test results (parsed by race, conveniently in this case) and the huge achievement gap that falls between white students and black/latino students. Then, they cock their heads like a confused dog at the numbers and plead the gap needs to be closed, despite the fact it&rsquo;s actually creeping upward.</p>
<p>But, in the end, this huge achievement gap is what keeps the dollars flowing in, so what do they care.</p>

		<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll be hearing that the ABA will not require LSAT testing for URM&rsquo;s.  Would it not be more simple to issue URM&rsquo;s a degree for being a URM without the necessary hardship of going to school?  After all, do we really want URM&rsquo;s taking up space in our law schools, and do we want to see them walking around in their baggy pants mumbling a language only they understand while doing the hip-hop boogie on the way to class?  I don&rsquo;t really think so.  The law schools would do us all a big favor if they simply issued URM degrees for free. </p>

		<p>What a coincidence.  The states just so happen to be rushing to deny the authority of almost every federal law on the books.  There will come a time when federal benches are simply eliminated.  The locals will refuse to allow them to judge law at all.  Instead, elected officials will rule on state and local laws ONLY (in some cases, there is an &#8220;or else&#8221; being thrown in there&hellip;.as in, enforce federal law&hellip;go to prison).</p>
<p>Let me ask a simple question.  Will these states hire AA law school grads to work in any capacity on either side of the bench?</p>
<p>I rather think that most of these graduates will have jobs that involve saying &#8220;you want fries with that&#8221;?<br>

		<p>Any minority (especially black) that can make it through law school and the Bar exam has it made in the shade.  They will easily find a job after getting admitted as almost every major law firm has a commitment to &#8220;diversity&#8221; disclaimer on their website.  Not to mention all the government attorney positions that will be given to a minority over a White applicant 9 times out of 10.  People outside the legal field may not realize this but there are literally thousands of attorneys out of work and recent law school graduates who can&rsquo;t even muster an interview.  However, there are plenty of &#8220;Diversity Job Fairs&#8221; to go around ensuring minority lawyers don&rsquo;t have to worry&hellip;  </p>

		<p>Thirty some-odd years ago I worked as a legal secy/paralegal in the Bay Area of SF, when legal secys WERE paralegals, for all intents and purposes.  Back then you HAD to pass the LSAT to get into law school.  People were jockeying for Hastings, LaVerne, Stanford, USC, Santa Clara, etc. etc.  What is this Hamfat Law School or whatever?  I never heard of that.  But hey, I&rsquo;d be happy to prosecute or defend a client whose opposing counsel was a Hamfat grad who never took the LSAT!!  Oh, my, talk about cleaning up&hellip;  Except no Hamfat grad would ever pass the CA bar.</p>

<p>The MBA / graduate business school students are very aware of the thousands of attorneys out of work and recent law school graduates who can&rsquo;t even muster an interview. </p>
<p>All of those attorneys out of work and recent law school graduates are flooding, clogging, and congesting graduate businesses schools.  In November 2009 and December 2009, you could not even get an appointment to take the computerized GMAT because there were more test takers than appointments. <br>

		<p>Here is where the big picture muddles things.  Sure it&rsquo;s smug to say that A/A graduates will be incompetents, etc.  But keep in mind, increasingly the judges will by non-white, as well as the jury pools, and the prosecutors, police &#8216;investigators&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>In the near future, smart, gifted white attorneys may find that anti-white racism from the bench and jury pool will render their brilliance moot.</p>

		<p>I am a white female who took the LSAT   &mdash;   twice   &mdash;   a few years ago. The LSAT is difficult, and yielded the most mediocre standardized test score I have received to date. </p>
<p>That said, I came to terms with my (second) LSAT performance after about a month of mulling it over.  Those who performed better than I, performed better.  I accept this and understand why I was not a candidate for many schools.   </p>

		<p>Yes, but would YOU want an affirmative-action Black lawyer representing you if you really need one?</p>
<p>Patricia Slade, former regent of Texas State University, a primarily Black  college certainly didn&rsquo;t. Charged with misusing school funds of nearly $200,000, Ms. Slade hired a top Texas defense attorney, Dick DeGuerrin to defend her. DeGuerrin, of course was White. He managed to effect an acceptable compromise keeping Slade out of jail.</p>
<p>TSU has a way of turning up in the news rather frequently. With the publicity invariably negative. One year the graduating class trip was to Tokyo. On the last day, these fine, &#8220;educated&#8221; students ran wild through Tokyo stores, snatching up expensive electronics and cameras, then running out of the stores with their stolen loot. Apparently ethics and morals are not issues covered in the TSU educational curriculum. Go figure, as the saying goes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Starting April 15, the University of St. Thomas School of Law will accept some students without LSAT scores, which, statistics show, are generally higher for whites than minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation:  Starting April 15th, it is no longer advisable that you hire a non-white lawyer, as chances are they&rsquo;ll be an AA graduate - much like non-white doctors.</p>
