<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/36428.html">Why No Blacks on SCOTUS Shortlist?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>L. Douglas Wilder, Politico, April 28, 2010v</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anyone paying attention to the lists [of potential Supreme Court nominees President Barack Obama is supposedly considering to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens] the media throw around would be left to believe that the names of potential black justices are being kept apart  &mdash;  segregated into a pile that no one in the White House is paying attention to.</p>
<p>But Marshall&rsquo;s legacy means too much to our nation to not consider a black nominee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the late 1960s, the nation&rsquo;s federal courts of appeal have provided the vast majority of nominees to the Supreme Court. When I look around the country, from appellate court to appellate court, I find many qualified African-American judges who could easily and naturally make the transition to the Supreme Court. Their names are augmented by the numerous black state Supreme Court judges who would also have little problem joining the high court.</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas just does not represent the aspirations, or reflect the perspective and experiences, of most African-Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} I do not believe Obama has yet finalized his roster of names.</p>
<p>Why? Because this president is not the type of man who would confine himself to the monochromatic lists that the great mentioners in the media keep foisting on the public.</p>
<p>Where is the diversity of life experience, education and ethnicity? Its absence tells me that Obama  &mdash;  who so richly exemplifies the diversity of the American mosaic  &mdash;  hasn&rsquo;t yet tipped his true hand.</p>
<p>But why limit this search to judges? I couldn&rsquo;t even begin to name the great number of black lawyers who could join the justices of the Supreme Court and serve with distinction.</p>
<p>Not to mention the plentiful crop of black law professors ready and able to serve.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama has a golden opportunity.</p>
<p>There are some senators today who want to stop any nominee the president sends up to Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>If Obama nominates a qualified person of color, he puts these senators in a bind: If they filibuster, the president can make a recess appointment. If after that appointment exhausts itself, senators fail to confirm the justice, Obama can nominate another like-minded person of color  &mdash;  thus opening the door for any number of people to have the experience of serving on the highest U.S. bench and giving that constituency a voice for as long as Obama is there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} We owe Marshall, and the country, more than that. God knows, we have waited; and no group of Americans has waited longer.<br>

		<p>Oh, yeah?  WOMEN have waited just as long as blacks, and we were represented in the same proportion on the Supreme Court that blacks are until Sotomayor.  I suppose B.O. could kill the proverbial two birds by nominating a black woman judge, but I would be surprised if he did that.  I also don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a real great idea to be thinking in terms of quotas - I&rsquo;d rather B.O. searched for the person who would do the best job, regardless of ethnicity. </p>

<p>Of course he has, &#8220;he will stand with the muslims&#8221; I would not be surprised to see him nominate a black Muslim convert to the SCOTUS&hellip;you heard it first here on Roller Derby!</p>

		<p>If Obama were to look &#8220;too black&#8221; he would cause a loss of Democratic seats in the Nov. elections and imperil his own reelection.  He&rsquo;s already in trouble for appointing far-left blacks to more obscure positions, and a Court nomination would be so high profile that almost everyone in the country would know about it.</p>

		<p>Justice Thomas doesn&rsquo;t represent the &#8220;aspirations&#8221; of blacks?</p>
<p>Thanks to the miracle of affirmative action, Justice Thomas was a average law student who played the race card to rise the highest heights of judicial power and became one of the most powerful men in America, and used his position to procure a white wife.</p>
<p>He is living the dream!</p>

		<p>I have some advice for current and future Supreme Court Justices:<br>
1.  Read the Constitution.<br>
2.  Study America&rsquo;s real history.  Not the phony version taught in our schools these days.<br>
3.  Study and understand the worldview of the great men who wrote the Constitution.<br>
4.  Apply your knowledge in points 1 through 3 and rule accordingly.<br>
Leave your age, life experiences, gender, sexual inclinations, politics, race, and point of view OUT OF IT!!</p>

		<p>I urge everone to see the movie &#8220;Food Inc&#8221;. The part about food giant Monsato is very interesting. Thomas was a lawyer for Monsato. When he was elected to the Supreme Court what was the first case he voted on? The Monsato case regarding copyrighting a modified soy bean. Things that make you hhmmmmmmmm.</p>
