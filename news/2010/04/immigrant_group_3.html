			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Preston, New York Times, March 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrant advocates seeking to raise Republican support for an immigration overhaul met on Wednesday with Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, but the effort got off to a rocky start when a dispute arose over what promises, if any, Mr. Steele had made during the meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several advocates emerged from the closed-door session to say Mr. Steele had pledged to help find at least one more Republican sponsor for a bill being crafted by Senator Lindsey O. Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democrat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Doug Heye, a spokesman for Mr. Steele, dismissed that account as &#8220;100 per cent inaccurate.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a little surprised that Juan McCain hasn&rsquo;t sponsored the bill.  Of course I&rsquo;ll be delighted if Lindsey Grahamnesty stands alone as the only &#8220;Republican&#8221; sponsoring the bill.  That will show just how &#8220;bipartisan&#8221; it is, and will serve as a wonderful club for Grahamnesty&rsquo;s next Republican primary challenger.</p>
<p>As usual the New York Times refers to &#8220;Immigration advocates&#8221; when they mean &#8220;Illegal immigration advocates&#8221;.  What a silly rag the &#8220;newspaper of record&#8221; has become.<br>

		<p>Lindsey Graham needs to be targeted for replacement in the next primary election for his seat.  All the pro-white people who still believe in working through the GOP need to make that a priority.  It could be a chance to flex political muscle.  I gotta think that a significant portion or white Republicans in South Carolina voters are open to explicitly racial appeals for getting rid of Graham.  If not in SC, where?  </p>

		<p>I remain dumbfounded at the existence of advocates of this form of illegality in the Republican party,  because it is so obvious that this, more than any other single thing, undermines that party&rsquo;s access to (now, &#8220;fading shot at&#8221;) power.  The next amnesty is intended to be the coup de grace that kills the Republican party for good, leaving America in the hands of a single, uncontested, anti-white party.   (Just as the leftists in Britain have done to that country, and for the same reason. ) </p>
<p>We have already tipped.  Because whites do not align themselves politically along racial lines, their voice as a racial group cancels itself, while the non-whites call the shots (because they DO align themselves politically along racial lines - against whites.)  </p>
<p>How frustrating it is to watch so many whites join them, when the shots they are calling are aimed at us, with the intent to destroy us - completely,  permanently.</p>
<p>I am hoping against hope that not only will whites recognize the true face of mortal threat, and &#8220;clean house&#8221;.  By that I mean, both within the party that may yet be reclaimed, and the current congress.  It is by no means enough, but it is a vital step which, if not taken, there will be nothing to halt the darkness descending on America. </p>
<p>At the moment, however it looks a lot like a fixed game, a perfect model of which is Abe Saperstein&rsquo;s  Harlem Globetrotters playing Red Klotz&rsquo;s ersatz competition, who only pretend to put up a fight but are really there to keep us entertained, and paying for it.  </p>

		<p>The RNC will take up the cause of the Mexican illegal but wouldn&rsquo;t touch the Afrikaner plight with a 10 foot pole.  Perhaps I should say 3 meter pole, since we will soon be a Mexican province.</p>
<p>The RNC is doomed.  The problems that are destroying this country are not the ones they address.  At election time they pretend to be Christians.  They pretend to be against affirmative action and abortion. They try to make gays out to be the big boogie man.  This is all for show.  They are one worlders at heart with no loyalty to the US let alone white Americans.  Once elected they stab us.</p>
<p>I voted for Pat Buchanan in 1980 in hopes he would garner enough votes to wake up the GOP.  I never expected him to win but could not stomach voting for Bush.  I figured Gore would win anyway.  I wish he had, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had these two never ending wars if he had.  In 1984 I voted for Kerry.  I didn&rsquo;t like Kerry but Bush was so horrible (other than his Supreme Court appointments, give the devil his due) that I wanted him gone.  I only voted for Juan McCain because of the Supreme Court.  I knew that Obama would only appoint Marxists and figured the one thing a McCain presidency would do right might be a Supreme Court appointment.  Otherwise McCain would be Bush III (or Obama lite).</p>
<p>I vote for the man, not the party.  I am a conservative, a true conservative.  The GOP is not conservative in any way, shape or form.  The GOP should stand for protecting our borders, deporting illegals, making English our official language, rebuilding our manufacturing base, bringing home our troops, recognizing our Christian heritage and foundation.  They should be for equal rights for all (within reason) and special rights for no one.  Why do I say &#8220;within reason&#8221;?  Because men and women, gays and straights are not the same.  Take the latest brouhaha: gays in the military. Gays openly serving would be a disruption.  Let&rsquo;s be real, sex is a strong force in people, especially young people. Have many gay men and women served admirably in our armed forces?  Yes.  Did they have to do it on the QT?  Yes.  Is that fair?  LIFE isn&rsquo;t fair!  Look at woman serving in the military and all the problems that has caused.  People are surprised when woman on air craft carriers get pregnant! DUH!  Men and woman should not be serving together.  There should be separate branches for woman.  Sexual tension is bound to exist, it is human nature.  Think it will be any different with openly gay servicemembers?  But can the GOP ever make a reasoned common sense argument?  NOPE.  Look at the social experiment called military integration.  Geeze, that turned out well. Blacks are a disruptive force in the military, as the commanders under Truman feared.</p>
<p>My basic point is: if the GOP wants to survive as something other than &#8220;the lesser of two great evils&#8221; they need to become pro-America.  Pro-America when it comes to our security and economy. They need to have a little common sense on social issues.  Many folks would be attracted to a party with some sound, fair minded, basic principles.<br>

		<p>Michael Steele recently spent over $1,900 of GOP donors&rsquo; money on strippers, and many thousands more on chartered jets so he can promote his book.  There is absolutely no way of knowing what this cretin promised or what he can actually deliver.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t wish enough bad things on the Republican party hierarchy.  This is the party the Bush family bequeathed us: the same snotty bunch of northeastern liberal trustfunders and bankers that had previously run the party into a box canyon of irrelevancy prior to the Goldwater/Reagan revival. It&rsquo;s there again, thanks to that Rockefeller wing.  Why should any white paleoconservative care what happens to a bunch of aristocrats who are selling out their own race?  I&rsquo;ll NEVER vote for them again.  NEVER!!!  I&rsquo;m sure Steele will irreparably damage what&rsquo;s left of their tenuous credibility.  Good riddance to the Party of Lincoln.</p>

<p>They and their ghetto baggage still are a disruptive force within military units. That is why, by a veiled tacit acceptance, the blacks are not to heavy in any unit but rear echelon types. Some now in the SF, Marine Recon and such are probably good because I believe we wouldn&rsquo;t allow an incompetent to remain in our unit or to remain alive&hellip;.the lives of every member of a team depends on every other member.</p>
