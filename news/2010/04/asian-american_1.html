			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Smith, The Politico, April 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asian-American Democrats are criticizing the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for favoring a white former congressman from Hawaii over the Asian-American State Senate President in a hotly contested special election to represent a majority-minority Hawaii district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine the disgruntled reaction were the DCCC to step into a contested special election in a predominantly African-American or Latino district,&#8221; Dutta [Gautam Dutta, the Asian American Action Fund executive director] pointedly added.</p>
<p>Viewing Case as the stronger candidate, the DCCC is reportedly quietly siding with former Rep. Ed Case over state Sen. Colleen Hanabusa in a nonpartisan election that also features a strong Republican candidate. {snip} Case, whose wife is Asian-American, has always been popular among Asian-American constituents, but the increasingly organized national Asian-American political class has long felt slighted by Democrats.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another prominent Asian-American operative said Asian-American Democrats see the move as &#8220;beyond an affront&#8221; and that there&rsquo;s an effort to organize a boycott of the DCCC by Asian-American donors.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable just how far gone multiculturalism really is. Now the Asians are getting into the act.  They&rsquo;re beginning to do what Blacks, Hispanics, and others are doing - They&rsquo;re crying racism at the drop of a hat.  One cannot even support a candidate who is White without it being called an &#8220;affront&#8221;.  I believe that we have to begin to think what the end result of all of this is going to be 10, 20, 30 years, etc. down the road.  Our rights as White people are rapidly fading into the distance.</p>

<p>All groups in a multicultural/multiracial society want dominance and control.  They don&rsquo;t want to assimilate into anybody&rsquo;s culture but their own, especially in America.</p>
<p>What part of that proclamation is difficult to understand by leftist radicals?</p>
<p>Diversity is a decided weakness and will eventually lead to war and break up.  What part of that does leftist radicals find difficulty in comprehending?</p>
<p>Will the coming demise and break up of Western societies enable them to understand how stupid diversity really is?</p>

		<p>Well, Hawaii is essentially an Asian nation that was taken as a US territory, then given statehood. I can&rsquo;t blame the Hawaiians for wanting an Asian to represent them. </p>
<p>I get that the highlighting of this issue brings attention to the blatant hypocrisy in America where if White Americans were to organize in protest against a non-White representing them, there&rsquo;d be cries of racism nationwide. But having said that, I hold no ill will against the Asians for having the solidarity that Whites are sadly lacking. </p>

		<p>Of course Asians want fellow Asians to reprsent them, the same way Blacks prefer Blacks and Hispanics prefer Hispanics to represent them.  It is natural, logical and justified.  </p>
<p>Yet, these same people believe that it would be incredibly racist and amoral for Whites to want Whites to represent them.  </p>

		<p>When a regional majority insists that the face of their leader be of their race, the house is divided.</p>
<p>Asians don&rsquo;t want to be ruled over by a white, Hispanics don&rsquo;t either, and blacks don&rsquo;t want to be ruled by anyone but another black (the world condoned it in South Africa).</p>
<p>If whites start insisting their leaders be white, then racial borders are the next logical step.</p>

<p>Nonsense. I&rsquo;m Indian. I don&rsquo;t care much if an Indian is my congressman, governor, or president, but I do care about whether those politicians let my wife and I keep the money we work hard to earn. Thus I loathe the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Regarding religion, Hindus, unlike many Muslims, do not care about making the whole world Hindu. </p>
<p>Many Asians can thrive in a limited government, free-enterprise society   &mdash;   look at the U.S., Hong Kong, Singapore, and many other countries. It is groups that underpeform in the market that will look to the government as savior.<br>

<p>Indian guy is correct. This intolerance of anything is a strictly muslim thing as we should know already. India is headed for gigantic problems with the muslims from Pakistan spreading into multi religious India and blowing things up. Indians are generally fairly peaceful people but they have been historically ruthless and blood thirsty as the British have found out on a number of occassions. Their toilet habits are sort of poor though, at least here in the muddled east.</p>

		<p>   Alas, I fear when Asian numbers reach a critical mass, as they have in Hawaii, Asians practice ethnic politics with a vengeance. Large groups of unassimilated immigrants seem to develop their own political agenda, particularly in a country like the United States with a racial/affirmative action spoils system. While I feel that limited immigration of highly qualified intellectuals/scientists may benefit a country, large scale immigration, which upsets the racial and ethnic balance of country leads to long term conflict and disunity. </p>

		<p>Dear Post # 6 Indian Guy,</p>
<p>You may not care if your leaders (in America) are White or Indian.  However I suspect that you care very much if your leaders are Muslim.  Hence, you, like most people, &#8220;don&rsquo;t want to assimilate into anybody&rsquo;s culture but their own.&#8221;  There is nothing wrong with that.  If you are Hindu, you prefer to be around Hindus and for Hindus (and not Muslims) to be directing your society and life (via government).  </p>
<p>Each racial, ethnic, &amp; religious group needs some sense of cohesion and survival, otherwise they are simply replaced.  Would you think it a good if the 800,000 Indian Hindus were to be replaced by Pakastani Muslims or Chinese?  If you do, then you are a traitor to your people and your religion.  </p>
<p>Nearly everyone at AmRen believes that each group should have the freedom to build their own societies and govern themselves as they see fit.  However our current government, believes that all White societies must be replaced by People of Color.  What is worse is that to accomplish that evil goal, our government takes money from White citizens (via taxes) and transfers it to the people who will soon replace them   &mdash;   all the while telling us that we are &#8220;racist&#8221; for resisting our extinction in our own homelands.</p>
<p>Please answer back: Would you approve of Hindi Indians being replaced by Muslim Pakastani or Chinese?  Did your ancestors approve of the colonization of India by the British, or did your ancestors prefer that Indians rule India (and not British) rule India?</p>

<p>You haven&rsquo;t disproved my point.  There are exceptions to every rule.  However, I really doubt that you are an exception.  I seriously doubt that you want to accept America&rsquo;s culture as your own in its entirety. Its traditions, its heroes, its historical figures, etc., all as your very own.  </p>
<p>All you have to do is read the news everyday to see for yourself I&rsquo;m right.  Do you think these contentious masses of blacks and Hispanics want to assimilate into American culture when they give ample proof of wanting their own organizations, their own histories, their own holidays, their own heroic and historical  figures, etc.?</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s the Asians who are breaking off and segregating themselves to pursue interests that are of importance only to them and their various groups.  We haven&rsquo;t seen it too much before, because they weren&rsquo;t that numerous in the past and the media never had much to say about them.  Also there are ethnic divisions between Koreans, Japanese, Hmong, Indonesians, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc., and, of course, Indians and other Asians are separate groups as well.</p>
<p>This country right this minute is on the verge 24/7 of breaking apart into racial/ethnic factions.  Each tribe in this country is jockeying for power and control for its own group.  It&rsquo;s a rare non-white who is concerned about things that affect the country as a whole.  Every one of them, generally, give their tribe first priority over everything else.</p>
<p>Only homogeneous societies have a chance of success.  Never in the history of mankind has any country in the world had a successful multicultural, multiracial society.  Most of them have torn apart into bloody warfare, even the Roman Empire, that consisted mostly of Caucasians, collapsed due to a difference in ethnicity, and this country will the same.</p>
<p>But, don&rsquo;t take my word for it.  Just wait and watch for another couple of years and see for yourself.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous @1:37 asks:<br>
 &#8220;Did your ancestors approve of the colonization of India by the British?&#8221; <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Allow me to make an important point here, regarding the key word &#8220;colonization&#8221;.   It&rsquo;s very misleading.  The British never &#8220;colonized&#8221; India in the genuine sense of the word    &mdash;   meaning to populate it with &#8220;colonies&#8221; of themselves.   They were content merely to rule it, not to settle there, and  were happy to leave the inhabitants in place.  There was no intent to displace them. In fact, they didn&rsquo;t even &#8220;rule&#8221; it directly, but through local rulers.  I have read, somewhere (I forget the exact statistic) that there were never any more than something like 15 or 20 thousand British in India at a time, administering a sub-continent (then consisting of many countries) of multiple millions.  They &#8220;ruled&#8221; it though a sparse but highly efficient administration;  but they never attempted, nor desired,  to populate it  (i.e. &#8220;colonize&#8221; it). </p>
<p>In India,  the local rulers were left in place, the laws, the customs, the religions. Even the local armies. The British were only interested in controlling the commerce for the benefit of their empire, not  (unlike the Spanish) in converting the populace, nor in  re-populating the country (with themselves or anyone else).  Thus, it was not a true &#8220;colony&#8221; of Britain in the precise sense [meaning an extension of Britain], but only a possession or an allied part of the empire. We don&rsquo;t have sufficiently precise terminology to deal with this.</p>
<p>It was  a very distinct situation from what developed in North America where they did indeed settle and take root, eventually, though not always by original intention.  But even there,  those settlements were confined and often planted outside of government approval/involvement (e.g. the Puritans who were defying England and trying to get away from it) or else acquired, already settled,  from other powers (e.g. Niew Amsterdam, Quebec).  The British  came to North America with not the remotest intent to displace the American Indians and populate the continent.  In fact, the British government often sided with the native Amerindians  against the interests of the colonists   &mdash;   a major cause of the American Revolution. The colonists felt they had been abandoned, betrayed, by their own government and people back in London.</p>
<p>A couple of centuries later, we see the same situation developing once more, with the perceived &#8220;enemy&#8221; now being located in Washington, not London.  Déjà vu!</p>

<p>Certainly, I don&rsquo;t want my leaders to be Muslim or to be live in a majority-Muslim country, simply because Muslims are intolerant when they are in the majority. By contrast, in majority Christian countries, or in a majority Hindu country such as India, other religions are tolerated. George W. Bush never made me go to church.</p>

<p>I would not, and India, like most countries, has an &#8220;ethnocentric&#8221; immigration policy. For example, since my children have Indian blood, they can apply for a Person of Indian origin (PIO) card and travel visa-free to India. Immigration policy in the U.S. changed drastically in 1965 to increase non-white immigration. It could have maintained the old policy, but white politicians such as Ted Kennedy chose not to. The U.S. still has the right to change its immigration policies to favor some countries over others. However, it cannot undo the legal immigration it has already permitted, and the goal of some white nationalists to carve out a whites-only country within the territory of the U.S. is utterly unrealistic.<br>

Hawaii was not taken; the people voted by the majority to become a state of the USA. Now that the country has been developed by the White man, they want it back.</p>
<p>Like the Southwest US, the Mexicans are taking back the land that the USA purchased from Mexico to relieve them of massive debt from war. A land, by the way, that was claimed by the White Spanish conquerors, who finally left the region because the native Latinos were too barbaric and wicked to tame. </p>

		<p>Do different races assimilate into the great American melting pot as our government, the media, and the education system keep telling us, or is each separate race, ethnicity and religion jockeying for its own piece of the pie?  Do racial, ethnic, &amp; religious differences pull us apart of bring us together?</p>
<p>One way to answer that question is to see if the Africans and New World Indians (Hispanics) who live among us love and respect the same historical figures and events as we do, such as George Washington and Columbus   &mdash;   or do they reject these cultural icons and demand their own historical figures and their own historical narratives, such as Martin Luther King or Cesar Chavez?  </p>
<p>It is clear that each race wants their own ethnic heroes, stories, and society, which they can control as they prefer.  This is why multiculturalism almost always leads to distrust, suspicion, stress, segregation, &amp; conflict, followed eventually by outright war, ethnic cleansing, and sometimes genocide of the side with the smallest population.  </p>

		<p>12 Indian Guy: You are mistaken.  The U.S. CAN undo the legal immigration that the government has allowed.  A sovereign state can do anything.  The USSR killed millions of their own people, the PRC did the same.  The world, unwilling or unable to intervene, did nothing.  After WW2, millions of Germans were expelled from the lands they were born in.  The same thing happened to Moslems and Hindus when India and Pakistan were established.  When we are faced with having the life drained out of our country by newcomers, we can do what we need to do, and are not bound by the promises of our political class.  Ethnic cleansing works.  It has worked against Whites in the civilization we built, and it can work for us.  The world will criticize us, shun us, and watch it happen.   </p>

		<p>Seems like most are beating up on poor Indian Guy.  Well, I think he&rsquo;s right, and if there are any two major racial groups who do assimilate well and live in relative peace, it&rsquo;s caucasians and Asians.  Our religions aren&rsquo;t aggressively prosyletizing, we both value education, individual achievement, honesty, and law-abiding behavior, and we&rsquo;re both relatively intelligent.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ve always liked East Asians, and though my exposure to Indians is more limited, I&rsquo;ve never met any I could say I disliked, though certainly there are disagreeable sorts within any racial and ethnic group.</p>
<p>I believe whites and Asians are going to need each other in the years ahead if we&rsquo;re to avoid being overwhelmed by black and Hispanic minorities, neither of whom share our values to the extent that Asians clearly do.</p>

When the work is done, people want to be paid.  The Mexicans have their demands, and the Orientals will too.  Or is fighting for your own people another job Whites won&rsquo;t do?  </p>
