			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David A. Patten, Newsmax, April 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has given U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder an April 12 deadline to state whether the Justice Department will stop stonewalling an investigation of alleged voter intimidation involving three members of the New Black Panther Party for Self Defense in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>A letter from Commission Chairman Gerald A. Reynolds to Holder declares that the organization&rsquo;s efforts to obtain information from the Justice Department are at an &#8220;impasse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission wants to know why the department dismissed a complaint filed against several New Black Panther defendants who were videotaped confronting a cameraman and brandishing a nightstick outside a polling place.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bartle Bull, an author and civil rights veteran who ran RFK&rsquo;s 1968 presidential campaign, was observing the Fairmont Street polling station in Philadelphia when the incident occurred. Bull filed an affidavit that stated he overheard one of the men tell a white poll observer, &#8220;You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull, a former publisher of the Village Voice, was awarded the 2003 civil rights medal by the late liberal lion Sen. Ted Kennedy for his voting-rights work in Mississippi. He was monitoring polling activities on Election Day 2008 in his role as chairman of New York&rsquo;s Democrats for McCain organization.</p>
<p>Bull&rsquo;s affidavit described the incident as &#8220;the most blatant form of voter intimidation I have encountered in my life in political campaigns in many states, even going back to the work I did in Mississippi in the 1960s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull tells Newsmax he believes the incident was part of a larger campaign to intimidate poll watchers, who were trying to expose voters who had been fraudulently registered by the now-defunct ACORN organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He adds that he was &#8220;appalled but not surprised&#8221; when the Holder Justice Department announced it was dropping the case. &#8220;Eric Holder&rsquo;s job is to defend the supporters of the administration,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Reynolds&rsquo; letter states that the department &#8220;appears to have failed to prosecute this case in a robust manner,&#8221; and by so doing &#8220;it appears to have provided hate groups of every ilk a precedent that will assist them in avoiding liability for voter intimidation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission isn&rsquo;t the only group getting stiff-armed while trying to find out why the department dropped the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been stalled as well,&#8221; Tom Fitton, president of the nonprofit Judicial Watch organization, tells Newsmax.</p>
<p>Fitton says Judicial Watch filed Freedom of Information Act inquiries on the case several months ago and has received no response.</p>
<p>Although Fitton plans to let the administration process continue to play out, he tells Newsmax &#8220;It&rsquo;s looking more and more like we&rsquo;ve going to have to sue in the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Washington Times reported Monday that, according to unnamed sources in the department, the Voting Rights Section had been on the verge of seeking judgments against the men when Loretta King, who was acting assistant attorney general, issued a delay order.</p>
<p>That delay reportedly came after a meeting with Associate Attorney General Thomas J. Perrelli. The Times reports that Perrelli. the department&rsquo;s No. 3 political appointee, approved dismissing the charges.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Commission is seeking to obtain testimony on the New Black Panthers decision from Justice Department personnel. It also seeks documents reflecting any communications among Loretta King, Holder, and Perrelli.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s particularly ironic that the nation&rsquo;s first black attorney general, the first black president, are in a fight with the civil rights commission on a voting rights case,&#8221; [Fitton] says.</p>
<p>The civil rights commission is an independent, bipartisan unit of the federal government, charged with investigating and reporting on civil rights issues, especially those affect a citizen&rsquo;s right to vote. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., also has been pushing the Justice Department to justify dropping the charges.</p>
<p>Both the original Black Panthers, and the Huey P. Newton Foundation, have condemned the New Black Panthers group, saying on its Web site that it &#8220;serves to incite hatred rather than resolve it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>That voter intimidation incident by the NBP thugs was an outrage&hellip;can you imagine if whites did the same thing? The media would never let you hear the end of it&hellip;all the black race-hustling &#8220;community leaders&#8221; would be out in force protesting. And since when can blacks casually use the word cracker for whites? Another example of the double-standard we have now under our post-racial president&hellip;..</p>

		<p>I wrote a letter to Halfrican American Attoreney General  Holder  about what happened to the American Renaissance Conference, and I requested that it be investigated. If I had been called Cracker, I would have said a few words that cannot be printed on this blog, and there probably would have been fisticuffs or worse.  </p>

		<p>This is actually good news.</p>
<p>If Holder had any sense he would have defused this incident out the gate and it would have been swept under the media&rsquo;s rug.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a little steam built up and hopefully the whistle will blow loud, drawing more attention to this corrupt fool than there might been had he acted decisively.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Bull filed an affidavit that stated he overheard one of the men tell a white poll observer, &lsquo;You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Funny how blacks never quite get the difference between limited constitutional representation in government and &ldquo;rule&rdquo; by a despotic criminal, or as they might better understand it, a gangsta in zenith. </p>
<p>Hence, Detroit and Zimbabwe!</p>
<p>These intimidation tactics in Philadelphia, only highlight this point. Moreover, they bitterly illustrate why the &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; movement abjectly failed to harmonize the races&rsquo; interactions, but only emboldened blacks to rape and murder whites at a horrendously exponential rate since the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; 1960s. They simply have no ability to conceptualize either moderation or accommodation with others; it all boils down to, &ldquo;who be winning&rdquo; or &ldquo;who done thinks they won,&rdquo; in that great basketball game of life with blacks, and other nonwhites for that matter.</p>
<p>Get the hint yet, whitey?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Does it really surprise folks on here that a black administration would favor and protect black people and organizations?  It shouldn&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;ve found your way here.</p>
<p>But the visceral reaction of white people who haven&rsquo;t yet been awakened when you point this out is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>There is hope.  Part of the reason the response is so rabid is because these folks see it too, especially when it&rsquo;s this overt, but their programming doesn&rsquo;t allow them to process the information correctly and it upsets them.  </p>
<p>More and more are coming around though.  When the chips are down people get back to baser instincts and they&rsquo;ll figure it out really quick.  </p>
<p>I feel sorry for them sometimes because it must be hard to learn that everything you&rsquo;ve been told your whole life about race is a lie.</p>

		<p>Not to beat a dead horse but how empowered would groups like ACORN be if they didn&rsquo;t have access to public aid money?</p>
<p>Socialism is the root of our problems with race.  Simply put, blacks don&rsquo;t have any power.  They are the most powerless people on the planet and have been for THOUSANDS of years.  What they do, they are ONLY able to do because we give them the power to do so.</p>
<p>All whites have to do to stop this, to stop them, if not utterly destroy them, is to simply stop giving to them.  Stop giving them money so that they can afford to live in our lands.  Stop giving them jobs (and the paycheck that goes with it) for work they are unable to do.  Stop manufacturing guns and shipping them off to africa or allowing them to buy them (with money we give them) in western countries.  Stop feeding them.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t really them, it&rsquo;s us.  And it is an active thing, not a passive thing.  We don&rsquo;t need to make an effort to do much of anything.  We need to stop exerting so much effort on their behalf.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even much different in places where blacks dominate.  For example, all whites in south africa and zimbabwe need to do is geographically isolate themselves and stop supporting the blacks who live there.  Don&rsquo;t raise food for them.  Don&rsquo;t run their electric plants, build their roads, mine their gold for them, nothing.  Do live apart from them and arm yourselves to fend off the occassional bandits.  They will literally collapse around you.</p>

 God I love that word!! It has come in handy as both a declared intention to defend my honor and an announcement that any further moves from an opponent will be met with resolved action.<br/>
 It is a gentlemans word that announces he won`t allow anyone to not treat him like a gentleman. It has entered my lexicon and is brought out to play with both people of my ethnicity and social class and those who aren`t. One of those  few words that always seems to  work for you in a situation instead of against.<br/>

<p>Not so long as they are profitable, that is! <br/>
Certainly not.  Why should they?<br/>
 <br/>
It is our fault for allowing them to be profitable. And it is in our interest to remove any profit from them. </p>
<p>When will we start doing good for ourselves, for a change, instead of being so concerned about what&rsquo;s good for everyone else?  Let us begin to be ruled by the maxim:  &#8220;Is it good for the whites?&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Being a Philadephia suburban resident I remember this incident well and wondering about the reaction had it been a bunch of redneck crackers threatening black voters. Of course, that never would have happened - nothing like that has happened in this country since the late Fifties.</p>
<p>As to the moronic comment about black rule, there may be black crime, black thuggery, black rape and black murder, but there ain&rsquo;t never gonna be &#8220;black rule&#8221; in any nation that&rsquo;s eighty-four percent white, Hispanic, and Asian.  We may have a silly African in the White House at the moment who clearly thinks he&rsquo;s our ruler, but that won&rsquo;t last long, and when it&rsquo;s over it&rsquo;ll be over for good.</p>

		<p>Each day that goes by it should become more clear that multiracial societies (particulary with a republican government as is the US) do not work.  How this fact remains largely hidden from the masses of whites I cannot understand.<br/>
So I see one of the posters mentioned moving to the Northwest.  Do you guys really think that is a feasible solution?  I am on the east coast and have great ties to my city (NYC) but it is hard to imagine living here while raising a &#8220;white&#8221; family in these conditions.  Even Long Island which was once the bastion of whites is being increasingly &#8220;diversified&#8221; to the point that even if you could shell out the ridiculous property taxes in Nassau County you still will  be subject to the never-ending &#8220;diversity&#8221; </p>

I realize that just by the fact you are on this site means you are aware of the problems&hellip;.but the attitude you convey I think is part of the problem of whites in general - complacency, and thinking that it really can&rsquo;t get that bad&hellip;now it is nice to hear something positive, after all almost e/t on here is negative and you can get pretty depressed real fast, but how can whites really not be worried about being ruled by minorities?  If most of our leaders (who are white) can&rsquo;t stand up for us now, what do you think is going to happen as we have increasingly less white and American leaders?  40 years ago we would of thought it would be crazy that America was going to have a non-white majority, but we are right on the brink of it as we speak. </p>

		<p>Thanks, 17 - Anonymous, for the link. Actually, some of the links on the site work. The New Black Panther Party platform item number ten includes the following statement:</p>
<p><i>We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace.</i> </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure all of the proceeding are desired to be given to them, not worked for or earned, including justice and peace&hellip;those are &#8220;white&#8221; conceptions, and wouldn&rsquo;t be found in a black &#8220;utopia&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I have been reading on this site for many months, typical black expectations.</p>

		<p>Hi DANNY - I&rsquo;m an old pedo - been around since 1945 - and am still considering moving out of the city where I live on the West coast (CA) to a place that&rsquo;s more remote - still in CA but out of the madding crowd, so to speak.  I&rsquo;m not real sure as to exactly where yet, but I do know the general area.  I&rsquo;m not putting it out here because I don&rsquo;t want it publicized.  I think any white person who can get out of the city and buy some acreage that&rsquo;s tillable would be smart to do just that.  It&rsquo;s gonna be survival time.  There are some great places in NC, TN, and the like as well.  For me it isn&rsquo;t so much for getting away from the blacks etc., although that IS part of it.  More important though is the plan to place myself in a position where I can take care of my own needs as much as possible.</p>

		<p>Blacks are preparing for a race war.  Anyone in doubt of this should visit a gun show and you will be surprised at what you see.  Without a doubt, whites are there too, buying target rifles.  Even AR15 type rifles are primarily target rifles and not battle rifles.  Blacks purchase AK47s whose caliber is a much better man-killer and will penetrate buildings and vehicles.  One wonders how many of the purchases by blacks are &#8220;straw man&#8221; buys.  Anyway, the blacks that I see exhibit the typical gangsta behavior.  These are not middle class blacks wishing to exercise their 2nd rights.</p>

Malik Zulu Anferny Latrina Lachunda Shamalamabazz whatever fake-African name you want to give yourself.  You&rsquo;re not a proud Zulu warrior, nor descended from one.  Zulus fought to the death, not captured.  Your ancestors that were brought here were POWs sold off by other black tribes in Africa.  Hahah. Go back to Africa and tell them that you&rsquo;re Zulu.   bwahahaha</p>

Exactly right.  Mr. Shabazz&rsquo; ancestors who were sold into slavery  got the better end of the deal. It was either be sold or be eaten.  It would have been one helluva big feast   &mdash;   with great-great-great-grampa the prime entree!   He should be grateful to those slave ships that brought him to a new life and new opportunities in rich and tolerant America.  (Let him try pulling that stuff in Africa and he&rsquo;ll find out what tolerance means.)</p>
<p>(Oh, and just to be picky, Mr. Shabazz&hellip; Zulus weren&rsquo;t Moslems and didn&rsquo;t use Arabic names either. Nor were they brought here.)</p>
