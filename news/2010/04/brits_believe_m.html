			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenny Hope, Daily Mail (London), April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British regard people of mixed race as the most attractive and successful, say psychologists.</p>
<p>Celebrities such as formula one champion Lewis Hamilton, footballer Ryan Giggs and X Factor star Leona Lewis have helped boost the image of mixed race people, according to a new study.</p>
<p>Psychological testing found they outstrip people who are white or black in terms of perceived attractiveness, with a rating that far exceeds their representation in British society.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr Michael Lewis, who carried out the largest study of its kind, believes there may be more than one reason for the cultural shift. </p>
<p>He says a &#8216;fusion&rsquo; of black, white and mixed races would lead to &#8216;Mr and Mrs Average&rsquo; being mixed race, resulting in people more readily identifying with them.</p>
<p>But there could also be a Darwinian explanation, with cross-breeding between diverse genetic backgrounds naturally leading to more genetically &#8216;fit&rsquo; people who tend to be more attractive.</p>
<p>However, TV&rsquo;s X Factor could be responsible for the trend by exposing relatively more talented people from mixed race backgrounds to the public gaze.</p>
<p>Dr Lewis and colleagues from Cardiff University&rsquo;s School of Psychology collected a random sample of 1,205 black, white, and mixed-race faces from Facebook communities, including &#8216;mixed race and proud&rsquo; and Cornwall-based.</p>
<p>Each face was then rated for their perceived attractiveness to others on a scale of one to 10 by 40 female students.</p>
<p>Overall, there was a 55 per cent chance that mixed-race faces were perceived as being more attractive than either black or white faces.</p>
<p>But the &#8216;extremely attractive&rsquo; ratings were dominated by mixed race faces, who made up one in 10 of them.</p>
<p>This is a much greater proportion than would be expected based on their representation in British society of around three per cent, said Dr Lewis.</p>
<p>Dr Lewis said &#8216;Previous, small scale, studies have suggested that people of mixed race are perceived as being more attractive than non-mixed-race people. This study was an attempt to put this to the wider test. </p>
<p>Other high-profile figures include Ryan Giggs and Tiger Woods, he told the British Psychological Society conference in Stratford on Avon.</p>
<p>Dr Lewis said humans are drawn to &#8216;average&rsquo; faces when they rate attractiveness, which could mean mixed race faces emerge the winners out of an amalgam of black, white and brown. </p>
<p>&#8216;They have become Mr and Mrs Average&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>A more complex explanation was first put forward by Darwin in 1876, who described a biological phenomenon called heterosis or hybrid vigour.</p>
<p>This predicts that cross-breeding will lead to offspring that are genetically fitter than their parents.</p>
<p>It is possible that humans are also subject to this process, so the mixing of diverse genetic background leads to greater genetic fitness &#8216;which tends to be linked to attractiveness&rsquo;, said Dr Lewis.</p>
<p>&#8216;There is evidence, albeit anecdotal, that the impact of heterosis goes beyond just attractiveness. </p>
<p>&#8216;This comes from the observation that, although mixed-race people make up a small proportion of the population, they are over-represented at the top level of a number of meritocratic professions like acting with Halle Berry, Formula 1 racing with Lewis Hamilton; and, of course, politics with Barack Obama&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>Dr Lewis said the popularity of shows like the X Factor, which had featured a high number of talented mixed race contestants also helped. &#8216;This could be part of changing attitudes towards black people&rsquo; he added.<br>

		<p>Oh, God, please, not that ancient &#8220;hybrid vigour&#8221; cliche <i>again</i>.  Is the left running short of tired catchphrases already?</p>

<p>Gosh, now <i>there&rsquo;s</i> a real cross-section of &#8220;the British people.&#8221;  No biased sampling there, no siree.</p>
<p>This &#8220;study&#8221; was so obviously and so flagrantly loaded from the start that it amazes me that even the British governmedia could print it with a straight face.  &#8220;Jenny Hope&#8221; will surely go far in Once-great Britain&rsquo;s Ministry of Propaganda.<br>

		<p>If there is the perception that mixed-race Britons are &#8220;successful,&#8221; it is because affirmative action plus their white genes means that any mixed-race person who can string two sentences together and obeys the law most of the time is going to be successful in a financial and career sense.  </p>

		<p>The mixed races (African Americans, Indians, and mestizos) are all prone to diabetes.  This study is simply propoganda for whites to hate themselves and mix with other races.  Whites are the only ones without race mixing taboos, the only ones that get bombared with messages to mix races, yet many still resist and  that is a real problem for the Marxists.  </p>

		<p>It may be possible that mixed race people, no matter what the mixture may be, are, on average, more attractive than those who are of only one race. Did you ever hear the term hybrid vigor?I had a girlfriend that was half German and half Black. I showed a picture if her to one of my co workers, and what he said was so lewd that it cannot be printed on this website.</p>

		<p>Pathetic.  The White Brits are going to die out faster than White Americans.  What some people don&rsquo;t seem to understand is that continued mixing of the races will lead to the eventual extinction of all races except those who would be considered as Black.

		<p>Please submit Dr. Lewis&rsquo; findings to peer review.</p>
<p>The claims he makes, using a study group of &#8220;40 female students&#8221;, are wild.  While he name-drops one or two international celebrities like Halle Berry and Barack Obama, he gives no data to back up the claim of &#8220;over-representation&#8221; of mulattos in meritocratic professions.</p>
<p>The good doctor would have assume the majority of people from mulatto races, like Cubans, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, are over-achieving thinkers and super-models.  On the contrary, the mulatto world of Latin America and the Caribbean isn&rsquo;t recognized for being more advanced, successful or for the outstanding beauty of its citizens.</p>
<p>Methinks this is a timely piece of leftist, cultural-Marxist propaganda, as immigration becomes an election issue in Britain.<br>

		<p> The validity of this whole article is questionable, as the conclusions of this so-called &#8220;study&#8221; fly in the face of what has been known for hundreds of years: People all over the world find lighter skin more attractive, darker skin less so. Why would people automatically find, say, intermediate colored skin and racially ambiguous features more attractive?</p>
<p> If miscegenation makes people who are &#8220;more genetically fit,&#8221; why is it that the Jewish people, who jealously guarded their ethnic purity to the maximum extent possible for many centuries, have excelled in so many fields, in so many different societies? You could say something similar about East Asians, who average the world&rsquo;s highest IQs, after Ashkenazi Jews; and who are known for their talents, tenacity and industriousness. And also   &mdash;   the most important part   &mdash;   for having, in general, little genetic admixture with non-Asian people.</p>

		<p>If this &#8220;study&#8221; is officially accepted, it means that the government will use it to justify hiring &#8220;these most successful people&#8221; because it is obviously the people&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>Meritocracy based occupations like entertainment?  Entertainment has to be one of the least based on actual merit than on popular demand.  And popular demand is determined in board rooms and by advertising agencies, and not harmed at all by liberal politicking for more minority inclusion.  So one non-white is now driving in formula one races.  I guess one cancels out all the whites the way Danika Patrick canceled out all the men in American formula one racing.  But not because she won, but because she is cute and does something usually dominated by men.  Obama did not win a presidential election, he won a popularity contest that was driven by money and aggressive internet promotion.  Readers may recall how he turned on his promise to obey campaign contribution limits.  How ironic McCain was beaten by such a man.</p>
<p>Quoting Darwin here is a usurpation of the principle he sought to illustrate.  Darwin would never have agreed that taking opposites that developed in geographically isolated and distant locations and artificially merging them was part of natural selection or would produce a superior outcome.  Man has created unnatural means in a situation that without aid, he can only walk about 3mph.  And that is all he did for a couple million years up to very recently.</p>
<p>Geneticists have determined that the most stable genetics arise from the mating of 4-5 cousins.  This makes perfect sense when one considers how many tribes and nearby tribes anywhere in the world for eons of time had to have been near relations.  Shocking genetics with huge admixtures doesn&rsquo;t produce a superior all the time, or even half the time.  It does produce confusion and insanity.  That insanity is demonstrated in this article because it is a rationalized, political writing and the author doesn&rsquo;t seem to even realize it.</p>
<p>Imagine voting your own children out of a job.  Imagine voting your children out of an identity, out of a country.  Individuals make that choice when picking non racially homogeneous partners, but imagine a government that sets up the scenario based on its own skewed studies.</p>

		<p>Well, I must say the Brits have been successfully brainwashed.  I guess the trick is to imprison the people who resist the programming.  Nick Griffin can tell you about that.</p>
<p><i>But there could also be a Darwinian explanation, with cross-breeding between diverse genetic backgrounds naturally leading to more genetically &lsquo;fit&rsquo; people who tend to be more attractive.</i></p>
<p>This is popular pseudo-science among liberals.  The fact is that inbreeding depression only occurs within vastly smaller populations than an entire race.  Given that genes evolve to work together, mixing up genes from different races is likely to cause more problems than it solves.<br>

		<p>They want to tell me that Halle Berry is more attractive than Vivien Leigh, Olivia de Havilland, or the likes of Angela Lansbury, all English actresses born before 1960 and renowned for their startling beauty.  I need not go on to list all the actresses of that era and their amazing white beauty.  This beauty was once more commonplace.  Now, it is growing less so, as the last of them are hunted down and drained of their youth and beauty by a white female hungry world.  Every means is being used to usurp their beauty.  Dr. Lewis can fool himself, but he can&rsquo;t fool me.</p>
<p>And the only thing attractive to a woman about Tiger Woods is his money and fame, two things women often respond to before looks.  This is certainly true in his case.  Anyone who can say that he is a good looking man is pushing the definition of perceptions into the realm of the bizarre.  He is a goon with money who uses all means to win, legal, ethical or not.  So that is your mixed race future.  You are welcomed to it.  I am not concerned because as you wipe my kind off the face of the earth, you are committing suicide. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But we were the most brilliant, the most strong, and by far, the most beautiful. After all, two billion men the world over can&rsquo;t be wrong. You may survive just long enough to realize that and morn as you roll over to make love to your octoroon female. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous to postulate that the child born of a beautiful black mother and ugly white father would somehow end up better looking than both parents and vice versa.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the intelligence issue. Some people are geniuses and others couldn&rsquo;t find their way out of a paper bag with help (Julius Malema is often portrayed as such). If you mix stupid with smart, you might actually end up with all stupid kids. High intelligence is NOT the norm world-wide.</p>

<p>They may be more attractive, but how does mixing low and high intelligence people work out? I would think the result would be an average of the two groups, thus bringing up the lower group, but lowering the higher intelligence group. I have heard and even noticed at times that *some* mixed race persons are very attractive looking (and some most definitely NOT!), but I have to wonder about the degrading of intelligence and other factors, such as disease resistance, which may not end up producing the greatest result.</p>
<p>So what if a few mixed race people are very attractive, if the rest are less so, dull, and disease prone? Not much of a deal, is it?</p>

		<p>Many make out that miscegenation is something that has been foisted on whites by the mass media bent on white destruction, and whites would not wish to miscegenate on their own accord.</p>
<p>That is just plain nonsense. Whites are the greatest miscegenators in history - they miscegenated the Native Americans, the Maori well before the era of modern day political correctness.</p>
<p>Most had no problem with the Pocahontas story, nor with Madam Butterfly.</p>
<p>And here in Hong Kong, white men pursue yellow women with crazed, lustful vigor. Its called &#8216;yellow fever.&rsquo; I hardly imagine these white men are pursuing Asian females simply because they want to be trendy and politically correct.</p>
<p>White men pursue Asian women and that is OK. But black men pursuing white women is absolutely prohibited?</p>
<p>Sounds a bit like hypocrisy to me.</p>

		<p>The term <i>hybrid vigor</i> is overused and abused by those who don&rsquo;t understand it. Most hybrids are not healthier than their parents. In fact, hybridization can be extremely harmful. Anyone interested in a nightmare scenario should check out the disaster of India&rsquo;s Chandigarh Chattbir Zoo when they tried to breed african and asian lions. They&rsquo;re blind, teeth falling out, wounds that won&rsquo;t heal, etc. They&rsquo;re all dying a slow painful death. </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/hybrid-lions" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/hybrid-lions</a></p>
<p>What these people don&rsquo;t realize is that there isn&rsquo;t one gene for eyes and one gene for lungs and one gene for kidneys. It takes a lot of genes working together to make these organs work. These genes evolved together in something called <i>co-adapted gene complexes</i>. Now, as different races, breeds, etc diverge the co-adapted gene complexes similarly diverge. And after awhile, there are new genes and new variations on these genes. Later on, when someone tries to mix those divergent races, breeds, etc they&rsquo;re mixing together genes that didn&rsquo;t evolve to work together.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes it works and one does get hybrid vigor. But hybrid vigor is the <i>exception</i> and not the rule. And even when it does occoru, it usually only lasts for one generation. Then one gets something called <i>outbreeding depression</i> as those co-adapted gene complexes are broken down. Outside the context of ruthless selective pressure, outbreeding depression will increase in power through the further generations as co-adapted gene complexes are broken apart without the forging of new co-adapted gene complexes to take their place. And that ain&rsquo;t a good thing. You can&rsquo;t put Ford parts on a Cadillac.</p>

The idea of actually having sex with a non-White person&hellip; to me, utterly revolting and disgusting.

		<p>  This article is gross propaganda for the &#8220;great dream&#8221; of our privileged liberal elites: the elimination of racism through widespread black/white miscegenation. If this was true, then Brazil, Egypt and other countries with high mixed race populations would be the envy of the world with the most prosperous economies, beautiful people, crime free cities, pollution free environments, etc. etc. However, don&rsquo;t most objective surveys indicate that the most prosperous and livable countries are also the most homogenous ones  &mdash;  particularly the white European ones in Northern Europe?</p>

		<p>&#8220;That is just plain nonsense. Whites are the greatest miscegenators in history - they miscegenated the Native Americans, the Maori well before the era of modern day political correctness.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Speaking of whites as the most prolific race of world settlers/conquerors, this may be true, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t true of whites in North America. There is no huge race of mixed mestizos (other than immigrants) in the United States, nor is there a huge number of mulattos, as in Brazil. In fact, interracial marriage was prohibited in many of these United States until the nineteen sixties. Why is it nonsense that our elites and the media press miscegenation today?</p>

<p>Later on it certainly became the case, especially in respect of black-white mixing. But how many pure-bred Indians remain today?</p>
<p>But frontiersmen commonly had their way with Indian women, and there was no social prohibition on this - thus the endurance and appeal of the Pocahontas story - to whites. Even Jefferson promoted the idea of white-indian miscegenation as something healthy.</p>
<p>But I would probably not be far wrong if Jefferson had in mind more the white male / indian female combination, rather than Indian braves ravishing blonde maidens.</p>
<p>And by the way, Sardonicus, do you and your fellow WN commonly speak of whites as one big family? And the glories of any white nation reflect well on all whites? Why then not the same for the disgraces of any part of that family, perceived or real?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The idea of actually having sex with a non-White person&hellip; to me, utterly revolting and disgusting.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That is all fine with me - and if you can convince all white men that East Asian women are disgusting, you will have my eternal gratitude (even though I am married to a white :) ).</p>
<p>But in the end surely who one dates is ones own business? </p>

<p>Funny, according to that pleasant email I received from yourself, with the &#8220;why can&rsquo;t we all just get along?&#8221; then flipping (within the same message) to the &#8220;I&rsquo;ve proudly bred with a white woman myself and I&rsquo;m gladly adding to your races destruction&#8221; message you dropped into my inbox a while back, you&rsquo;re in New Zealand. </p>
<p><b>So that would make you a yellow man who pursued a White woman with crazed, lustful vigour. <br>
It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;White fever.&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a White man who has blue eyed White children, so who is the hypocrite here?<br>
You&rsquo;ve often fought for your people<i> on this forum from within a White country, with a White partner. <br>
But yet you still have &#8216;Asian pride&rsquo;, so how are we really that different?<br>
Well for one, my off spring resemble my ancestors, where yours are closer to being a some sort of a &lsquo;social experiment,&rsquo; who you&rsquo;ll probably tell &ldquo;are members of two cultures&rdquo; but in reality are really true members of neither.<br>
It seems that you want to enjoy the best of both worlds, keeping pride in your ancestor&rsquo;s past(s) while contributing in the constant re sculpting and destruction of White countries to suit your own perverse, self serving image of how we all ought to be.<br>
Proud Whites are the only obstacle to having it all your own way. <br>
The Western world is on the decline and you&rsquo;re opportunistically benefiting, congratulations.<br>
I&rsquo;m curious, does your White partner know how much hatred you have for proud White folk? And I&rsquo;m not talking about the easily marginalised extremists, but the normal, everyday, middle class, hard working Whites who know how lucky they are and who don&rsquo;t want to just &#8220;give it all away&#8221;.<br>
You probably think that you are a good man, don&rsquo;t you John Liu, a man who fights for good. <br>
Well there are two sides to everything.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that poster #20 is right.  Whites have traveled further and done more race mixing than any other race before.  I do believe that in the case of the indians of north and south america and also for africa this has been more beneficial to them than to whites. (In terms of adding newer and better genes.)  I do not ignore the fact that oppression also did occur of the natives.</p>
<p>With that said, I&rsquo;m sorry to say that there are some very beautiful mestizo women in the latina community.  Oh, if you&rsquo;re wondering, many southern Italian women are mestizos also.  (Mixed with north african, arab and others.  That&rsquo;s why so many are broen skinned with exotic looking faces.)  </p>
<p>A lot of russian women, even with blond hair, have clearly asiatic features (due to proximty with asia.  Many southern europeans and even greeks are mixed with turkish blood, due to the ottomans.  (Turks are a mix of greeks, turks, arabs and central asians.  (Some are as white as you and me, with varying degrees of mixing.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand your post (although I&rsquo;m flattered you found my email so interesting as to check out my email headers!) - you have not addressed a single point I raised. I am pointing out white hypocrisy when it comes to race mixing - many here decry white women with colored men, and carry on as if there is some massive conspiracy to force whites into the arms of coloreds - when it is in fact whites who have been in the business of miscegenating other races out of existence right throughout history.</p>
<p>And yes, I did enjoy my holiday in NZ - enjoyed the hot pools at Rotorua (I have friends studying at the University of Auckland - a cheap education from a cheap country). And one thing I noted about the place was the significant amount of Polynesian-white couples- I notice this sort of thing. Correct me if I am wrong, but apparently there are about zero pure blooded Maori left are there not?</p>
<p>One other note about the so called precariousness of the white race in terms of numbers. There are about 1.1 to 1.2 billion pure whites in the world (about 1.3 to 1.4 East Asians). So whites are in the same ball park as East Asians when it comes to racial numbers. Whites are the second most numerous race on the planet! </p>
<p>And of course if we included people who are actually racially close to whites like some North Africans, then white numbers would be close to outnumbering East Asians. This whole thing about whites dying out is just a complete misrepresentation of the facts - there are more significantly more whites on the planet than blacks. </p>
<p>And what is more, the only people who have ever acted with genocidal intent against any group of white people, are other white people. White people have slaughtered far more of each other, have committed far more horrible atrocities against one another than colored people have ever done to whites.</p>
<p>On historical precedence alone whites have more to fear from whites than from non-whites.</p>
<p>PS. Yes my kids are half-white, and so what? Where have I ever said I am a racial purist? Although I do hate seeing Asian women with white men - but that is not a reasoned ideological stance, just a gut reaction against the typical nature of these pairings.</p>

Have you ever heard of an Haitian who is claimed to be &#8220;beautiful or handsome&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely sure nobody finds Obama or Hamilton or Woods  attractive (purely based on beauty, rather than fame), even by black standards.</p>
<p>I think Britain is going to implode soon. There is not enough space for everyone unlike the USA so they can&rsquo;t secede from non-whites. </p>
<p>Moreover, I&rsquo;m not sure they even want to remain white. Most Brits are among the &#8220;least&#8221; racially conscious people on earth, they wouldn&rsquo;t care if their country become mulatto or South Asian.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t consider Arabs to be Caucasian. In fact, I would think very few people on this site would. I don&rsquo;t see how Arabs could be considered Caucasian/White. </p>
<p>I tend to think guys go for mixed-race women more than ladies go for mixed raced guys. Guys historically liked to conquer other people, this could be part of that - spreading the genes to diverse groups will make those groups more like yourself, so a good thing. Sperm is cheap, spread it around.</p>
<p>IQ seems to take a hit with mixed races though. Latin America and Turkey are all heavily mixed and they produce very little intellectually, relative to their populations. According to IQ data, Turkey is on the low end for Europe while less mixed European nations are much higher (See work by Richard Lynn).</p>

<p>  &mdash;   quotes from John Liu</p>
<p>Funny that whites are usually the ones to cry about their own impending supposed genocide/marginalization, certainly more so than other groups, when in fact it is they who have committed these acts against others in the past.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is an uneasiness in the minds of whites that what goes around comes around.</p>

		<p><i>you have not addressed a single point I raised</i>.</p>
<p>Mr Liu you flatter yourself again, in this case by thinking that I was attempting to reply to your post in rebuttal form.<br>
I was actually trying to talk to you directly thinking of the ongoing themes in your posts.<br>
Let me say first off, that I sort of enjoy your presence on this forum for entertainments sake, in a &lsquo;cat amongst the pigeons&rsquo; sort of a way, and that I think you are an fairly eloquent writer who is obviously well educated and that at the least I often enjoy the responses that you provoke.<br>
But there are a few convenient contradictions in your attitude and arguments that really annoy me (I&rsquo;m assuming of course, that is your goal), like how you often judge  all of us Whites collectively using current day standards of political correctness coupled with a historical revisionists view e.g. reprimanding us today for using the Atomic bomb to end WW2 against the then fanatical Japanese in 1945, who at the time showed nothing but murderous distain for your very own people, but yet who still merit your racial loyalty with in that argument (this is the first such specific example that comes to mind).<br>
According to you we must all automatically inherit all the sins of our fathers, born guilty perhaps or maybe it&rsquo;s the flip side of the genetic predeterminism arguement eg. &#8220;those racist Whites are bad because they were born that way!&#8221;<br>
Whereas I have very few apologies for the past deeds of my people and I do not lay claim to any guilt, there is no denying that after ignoring various acts of bravery, expert strategizing and utilizing our technological superiority that <i>some</i> of our methods for achieving our various historical victories were nothing short of despicable &lsquo;by today&rsquo;s standards&rsquo;, but then as you&rsquo;ve pointed out yourself those same &lsquo;win at all costs&rsquo; tactics and often barbaric actions were also committed by Whites on Whites also.<br>
For the record my ancestors were always closer to being the serfs anyway.<br>
If we&rsquo;re all going to be judged in the same bucket, the least you can do is to give us some of the collective credit for trying to turn some of those deeds around too. <br>
As anyone who frequents Amren knows, White liberals are probably us Pro Whites biggest enemies, but they are still White and are just &lsquo;a change of mind&rsquo; away from being on the pro White team themselves (there are many converts here). <br>
I think it&rsquo;s our need to at least be perceived as being overly civil and fair (that no doubt stems from that same kind of guilt that J.L. peddles), that is really letting us White folk down, we never seem to be able to wipe the slate clean either, it seems impossible so why bother trying? <br>
With the current standards of political correctness, we historically wouldn&rsquo;t have achieved squat in the world at large today. <br>
And if by only judging our mindsets, as opposed to our capabilities I&rsquo;d like to ask &ldquo;how much fear or respect do our White countries command today&rdquo;?<br>
Collectively it&rsquo;s <b>the will</b> &lsquo;to do&rsquo;, that seems to be the one unifying thing that we are missing to be great again.<br>
Thank god for the bad old days hey.<br>
But yet everyone on earth has benefited is some way from the White mans innovations and generosity, especially yourself *Mr. Liu so please stop whining about our past misdeeds, as it&rsquo;s a mixed bag and we are all beneficiaries from it.<br>
*={a line from your New(&lsquo;the cheap country&rsquo;)Zealand generated email, which I dug up today <i>I&rsquo;m from your neck of the woods. Antipodean just like you.</i>&hellip;. written whilst on holiday? Yeah right .i.e. you&rsquo;re directly benefiting!}</p>
<p>And on the interpersonal/micro level you also talk of the freedom to love freely but then you talk with an admirable honesty (I must admit), of the &lsquo;gut reaction&rsquo; aversion you have to seeing White men with Asian females, although you are an Asian male with a White female? <br>
This is a hatred that I don&rsquo;t fully understand, because surely you must know that your White female partner is only half a chromosome away from being that White male who you despise so much herself? That must play on your mind sometimes surely.<br>
Also I assume that with your attitudes that when it comes time for your children to &lsquo;pair bond&rsquo; that you&rsquo;ll be urging/influencing your daughter to stay away from those nasty White men, but you&rsquo;ll probably turn a blind eye or even encourage your son to be just like dear old dad.<br>
If this is true with the latter, what bigger compliment could you give the White race?<br>
As if your next generation chooses to follow your path and choice of location, odds are that your descents will be 75% White, then the next generation again 87.5% White, then 93.25% White and so and so on, until your unique Asian characteristics will be gone, invisible to the naked eyed, absorbed in the White genome (well providing you choose to live in well maintained and ongoing, homogenous White town).<br>
And although you say that you&rsquo;re not a racial purist, you speak with too much venom to make me believe that you&rsquo;d be fine with the idea of your Asian characteristics disappearing completely without this bothering you.<br>
I believe that like most non Whites who want to destroy us such as you do, it must be only because deep down you want to be us.<br>
This could keep going, but I better end it here.<br>
