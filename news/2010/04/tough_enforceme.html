<h1><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/21/nation/la-na-obama-immigration-20100422">Tough Enforcement Against Illegal Immigrants Is Decried</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ken Dilanian, Los Angeles Times, Aprl 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When the Obama administration went before California&rsquo;s 9th Circuit Court last year seeking to deport a middle-class couple from Nevada, one judge criticized the government&rsquo;s case as &#8220;horrific.&#8221; Another labeled it the &#8220;most senseless result possible.&#8221; A third complained of &#8220;an extraordinarily bad use of government resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case against the carpenter and the clerk is one of many examples, immigrant rights advocates and labor activists say, of how the Obama administration has continued a policy of tough immigration enforcement against people who are no threat to the United States, even as the administration calls for a new immigration law designed to legalize many of them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But immigrant rights activists and immigration attorneys point to climbing deportation levels and say the government is pursuing untold numbers of equally disturbing cases against students, nannies and janitors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People feel betrayed,&#8221; said Deepak Bhargava, executive director of Center for Community Change, a pro-immigrant group. &#8220;The president never said he was going end immigration enforcement, but he sent a clear signal that he would redirect it to a focus on people with criminal records who are a threat to the country. That hasn&rsquo;t happened.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>Obama is a typical politician. He doesn&rsquo;t want to alienate people by being an adamant opponent of illegal immigration, nor does he want to alienate people by being an adamant supporter of illegal immigration. Nonetheless, he still alienates people by focusing his efforts on other issues.</p>

		<p>A better question would be&hellip;.</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to go all the way to the Federal 9th Circuit Court for a separate ruling to deport a pair of illegal aliens?</p>
<p>When apprehended, deport them immediately. What legal question could there possibly be? (that would involve Circuit Court)</p>

		<p>Well, with B.O., what would you expect?  He&rsquo;s going to go to the side of the bread that has the most butter, like every other politician who knows how to survive.  This is no surprise.  I do wish the folks in DC would get behind the AZ folks though!</p>

		<p>Obama is NOT a typical politician.  He is a lifelong student of the Saul Alinsky rules for radical change and takeover, converting a country to Socialist  Marxist government.<br/>
Nor is he &#8220;naive&#8221; as a lot of people say.  He is NOT naive.  He knows exactly what he is doing, what he has to get accomplished before his term runs out, and he cares NOT if he gets re-elected as long as he can turn this country into a Socialist Marxist nightmare.  THAT is what he wants as his legacy - force us past the tipping point and change us to a Marxist nation far enough we can&rsquo;t recover.  It&rsquo;s what he thinks he was born for.  Truly.</p>

		<p>Read the full article, it has sob stories where we are supposed to feel pity on those poor illegals who &#8220;don&rsquo;t have a criminal record.&#8221; I guess I&rsquo;m cold hearted, &#8216;cause I don&rsquo;t feel anything but resentment towards them. They are here illegally, and that&rsquo;s enough of a crime for me to want them out of our country.</p>

		<p>This coming November would be a great time to deliver an unmistakeable message to Obama&hellip; by voting REPUBLICAN! No, I concede, they&rsquo;re no better than the Democrats. But a shift in the power balance in Congress would do much to NULLIFY Obama&rsquo;s efforts to dismantle our nation.</p>
