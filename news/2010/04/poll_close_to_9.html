<h1>Poll: Close to 9 in 10 Latinos to Fill Out Census</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Yahoo! News, April 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What boycott? Close to 9 in 10 Hispanics say they intend to participate in the 2010 census, with immigrants more likely to say the government count is good for their community and that personal information will be kept confidential, according to a new poll.</p>
<p>The Pew Hispanic Center survey, released Thursday, appears largely to put aside concerns that Hispanic discontent with the government&rsquo;s slow progress on immigration reform will curtail participation in the high-stakes count now under way. The National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders had suggested a Hispanic boycott of the census to protest the lack of action on immigration.</p>
<p>Hispanics, who make up roughly 15 percent of the nation&rsquo;s population, still tend to lag behind other racial groups when it comes to mailing in census forms. But the latest survey suggests the numbers may be improving and that, contrary to conventional notions, the hardest-to-reach may not be fearful immigrants but rather disenchanted Hispanics born in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Census Bureau director Robert Groves this week also was urging several regions of the U.S. to step up their response. They include five states with higher shares of minority or indigenous populations that ranked at the bottom in participation: Alaska, New Mexico, Louisiana, New York and Texas, each with participation rates of 41-46 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ignoring the native-born Latino population,&#8221; said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, noting that a similar pattern is seen in Hispanic voting. &#8220;There is a sense of optimism that immigrants bring to this country, while people who have been here for generations have a certain sense of being beaten down and disengaged, whether by the cycle of poverty, or unemployment, or discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that becomes our hardest challenge  &mdash;  motivating the native-born to engage in U.S. society,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center, attributed immigrants&rsquo; positive views of the census partly to aggressive outreach by advocacy groups and Spanish-language media such as the Spanish-language Univision television network. The Census Bureau, which mailed out Spanish-English bilingual forms for the first time this year, also spent more than $25 million in advertising targeted primarily at the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, about 85 percent of Hispanics say they already have sent in their census form or definitely will do so, up from 65 percent in early March. But among immigrants, the rate increases to 91 percent, compared to 78 percent for U.S.-born Hispanics. In 2000, the mail participation rate among Hispanics was roughly 69 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 80 percent of foreign-born Hispanics said they believe the census is good for their community, often citing the principle that every person should be counted, or that it helps with school funding. But among U.S.-born Hispanics, that number drops to 57 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The differences were evident even though Hispanic immigrants were more than twice as likely to have seen or heard something discouraging them from participating, such as the recent boycott call by the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders. Still, only about 16 percent of Hispanics overall reported hearing such messages.</p>
<p>This week, the Census Bureau will send out replacement census forms to areas of the U.S. that traditionally have seen lower response rates. It also will decide whether and how to spend up to $7 million of its reserve fund on additional census advertising for areas with particularly low participation. So far, the bureau has spent a total of $133 million on ads.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau will continue to accept mailed-in forms through most of April and is striving to match, if not surpass, mail participation rates in 2000 of 72 percent. The bureau estimates that for every percentage point increase in the mail participation rate, the government saves about $85 million in follow-up costs.</p>
<p>From May until July, it will send more than 600,000 census-takers to each home that doesn&rsquo;t reply by mail, {snip}.</p>
<p>The study was conducted for the Pew Hispanic Center by SSRS/ICR, an independent research company, which interviewed 1,003 Hispanic adults by cell or home phone from March 16-25.<br>

		<p>In pre-emptive reply to those who will complain that the Census counts illegals, everyone keep in mind that answering the Census has NOTHING to do with the eligibility to vote; and that if they weren&rsquo;t counted, municpalities would be way short of bus routes and hospitals because they weren&rsquo;t able to plan correctly for their user population base.</p>

		<p>As a SoCA resident, I know a lot of Hispanics, and none of them seem to have any problem with the census.  We all filled out our little 2-page questionnaire (only for them it was longer because they have more people in their families than I do, usually) and sent it in with no problems.  Neither they nor I get what the big deal with the census is - but then the Hispanics I know are legal residents, which might make a difference.</p>

		<p>I fail to understand why racial or ethnic information is necessary to taking a census.  A simple head count should be sufficient to determine how many people are actually here.  I also am at a loss to understand why they ask for immigration status seeing they have no intentions of enforcing our borders anyway.  Moreover, legal or not, these immigrants should not be given special treatment, i.e. have the red carpet rolled out for them with government translators.  They should learn English like my ancestors had to.  That&rsquo;s the very least that should be expected of them, if nothing else.</p>
<p>I can see why illegal immigrants are eager to be counted in the census, because they have an endless goodie bag of free government paid benefits opening to them.  But as a White, I have no intentions of the government counting me as one of the poor saps having to pay for them.  Thanks, but no thanks.</p>

		<p>Seems to me like the only thing the census was interested in was your race.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So that the government can further &#8220;enrich&#8221; with &#8220;vibrancy&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221;, those few remaining areas that are still largely populated by Americans?</p>

		<p>A nation has recently died, it&rsquo;s legacy and future have been burned. A once great Republic has been turned into a decadent, crumbling empire. No one in this evil, stupid government knows who is a citizen, who is an illegal border crasher with ten aliases, false federal documents and multiple driver&rsquo;s licenses, who belongs here, who is carrying a briefcase nuke, or who a real American is. Nor do they even CARE.</p>
<p>But hey, let&rsquo;s talk about &#8220;census.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hear warped calliope music, and the room is spinning. It&rsquo;s either &#8220;Fear and loathing in Las Vegas&#8221;, or this is TRULY a nightmare.</p>

		<p>Let &#8216;em be counted.</p>
<p>Most Americans probably think that illegal immigration is something that is still isolated to the Southwest, controllable in size, and can be corrected before it becomes a problem.  They think they have the luxury of time.</p>
<p>But anyone who isn&rsquo;t afraid to notice knows that the numbers of immigrants from south of the border are much higher and the populations are more widespread than people think.  When and if the census results reflect that, maybe it will be a wake-up call.</p>
<p>12-15 Million is the number of illegals often reported. I&rsquo;ll bet there are twice as many.</p>

<p>BECAUSE of the illegals those things happen anyway. Illegals shouldn&rsquo;t BE there to BE a USER population.</p>

		<p>The purpose of the census, as outlined in Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, is to determine the number of people in a state, which in turn determines its number of members in the House of Representatives.  While the illegal hordes and their left-wing confederates certainly want more representation in Congress, another motive for getting the illegals counted is the increase in federal handouts that will get funneled into areas with rapidly growing populations.  Of course this was not an issue when the constitution was written since you either worked or starved back then.         </p>

		<p>There are at least 30 million <i>illegal</i> immigrants. They get federal money, access to resources and can vote regardless. They will get more fed funding AND representation in congress if they can be counted.</p>
<p>This is tax money (more to be extracted soon) from the white indigenous population to be redistributed from your children who are now the minority to these  transplants. (Remember  &mdash;  even though whites will be in the minority, they will NOT receive any preferential treatments!)</p>
<p>Illegal nonwhites prefer to remain undocumented because they do not have to answer to the government in any way including paying taxes. IOW, they are more free than the &#8220;law-abiding&#8221; citizen.</p>
