<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/22/bbc-sky-debate-nick-griffin">BBC Sidelining Sky Election Debate to Avoid More Nick Griffin Interviews</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Robinson, Guardian (London), April 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The BBC is resisting calls to screen tonight&rsquo;s election debate live on BBC1 or BBC2 because executives believe strict impartiality rules would force them to hand more airtime to BNP leader Nick Griffin if it did so.</p>
<p>BBC executives are worried that could prompt a revolt among senior journalists, many of whom are opposed to the amount of coverage the corporation has already devoted to Griffin.</p>
<p>Sky News, which will host the second debate in Bristol, has made the rights available to rival broadcasters, but the BBC has chosen to simulcast it only on BBC News 24. It will also be simulcast on Radio 4 and repeated on BBC2 at 11.30pm.</p>
<p>That is likely to restrict the size of the TV audience to a fraction of the 9 million who tuned in for the first debate on ITV1 last week.</p>
<p>The BBC has drawn up a detailed plan to ensure it meets its legal obligation to produce fair and balanced coverage next week, when it screens the third and final election debate on BBC1.</p>
<p>It has placated fringe parties who were angry at being excluded from the leadership debates by ensuring their leaders are handed airtime in TV and radio news bulletins.</p>
<p>As part of this plan, Griffin has been invited to take part in a lengthy interview on Radio 4&rsquo;s flagship daily current affairs show, Today, the morning after the debate.</p>
<p>Screening a second live debate would force the BBC to ask him on to the same programme again, meaning that Griffin will be interviewed twice in a high-profile BBC slot in as many weeks.</p>
<p>Executives are anxious to avoid a repeat of the angry scenes that greeted Griffin when he was a guest on Question Time last year.</p>
<p>A Twitter campaign has been launched asking the BBC to show the debate live on a terrestrial channel, but insiders insist there is no chance of a U-turn.</p>
<p>Another BBC source indicated that the BNP was not central to its thinking and what the corporation was keen to ensure was that licence fee payers could see or hear the debate, pointing out that 95% of households have access to Sky News or BBC News Channel on digital TV.</p>
<p>A BBC spokesman said it was &#8220;fulfilling its public service duty&#8221; by showing the Sky News debate on other outlets.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s strict election guidelines mean that the leaders of smaller parties such as Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the Green Party must appear regularly on the main news bulletins in prominent slots.</p>
<p>Handing the main party leaders a further 90 minutes of primetime coverage tonight would have presented BBC executives with a major headache. They have to ensure rivals are given a proportionate amount of time on similar outlets with large audiences, rather than simply ensuring they appear somewhere on one of the BBC&rsquo;s many services.</p>
<p>The BBC editorial guidelines state: &#8220;The way in which due accuracy and impartiality is achieved between parties will vary. It may be done in a single item, a single programme, a series of programmes or over the course of the campaign as a whole. But content producers must take responsibility for achieving due accuracy and impartiality in their own output and not rely on other BBC services to redress any imbalance for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scheduling tonight&rsquo;s debate on the BBC News Channel will make it easier to ensure balanced coverage because it broadcasts 24 hours a day and reports on the BNP and others can be aired at any time.</p>
<p>At the time of Griffin&rsquo;s Question Time appearance, senior executives said privately that they feared the BNP could mount a successful legal challenge if they failed to invite him on the programme after it won two seats in the European elections in May 2009.<br>

		<p> Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how the BBC does all this huffing and puffing about its &#8220;legal obligation&#8221; to provide &#8220;fair and balanced coverage,&#8221; while at the same time straining to find a way to limit Nick Griffin&rsquo;s air time?</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s also interesting that &#8220;senior journalists,&#8221; whatever that means, are threatening to &#8220;revolt&#8221; over any additional coverage given the BNP. Are journalists not supposed to be &#8220;fair and impartial&#8221; about their coverage of the news? Of course, we all know that, by and large, they are not; as a group, in this country, in Britain and in most other societies, they lean heavily Left.</p>
<p> But then, it&rsquo;s not surprising to hear that the BBC is trying to put its thumb on the scales, presumably to help its favorite party, the Laborites. It has long had the name of favoring the left-liberal side in British politics.</p>

<p><i>Executives are anxious to avoid a repeat of the angry scenes that greeted Griffin when he was a guest on Question Time last year.</i></p>
<p><br>
This is a lie. There were no &#8220;angry scenes&#8221; that greeted Griffin when he was a guest on Question Time last year that couldn&rsquo;t be contained by BBC security staff. If these tenured British Broadcasting Communists are so concerned to avoid another &#8220;angry scene&#8221; around the studio   &mdash;   which was BTW provoked ENTIRELY by the LEFT, and NOT by the BNP   &mdash;   then let them beef up their usual Security staff a little for the occasion. There&rsquo;s nothing about a Nick Griffin appearance in BBC studios that couldn&rsquo;t be handled by a few extra Security personnel on the payroll for a few hours. Anything else is pure propaganda from tenured Marxists living off the British people&rsquo;s taxes and their TV license fees. </p>
<p>What these BBC executives are anxious to avoid a repeat of, is another successful, vote-winning TV appearance by the eloquent and persuasive Nick Griffin. They know that, no matter how much they tried to sandbag him last time, he made a strong impression on viewers   &mdash;   and directly caused large numbers of new members to join his British National Party. </p>

		<p>Too late, lol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer people seeing what BNP is really all about and discovering they actually support them.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s about the results of voting them into power.  As people see the good results, they will want more of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s far too late for media spin.</p>

		<p>For the benefit of our American cousins, Sky News is available for free for anyone who has a digital television. Its no longer a subscription service.</p>
<p>What we have here is BBC is passing the buck to Murdoch owned Sky News who can be a lot less impartial. (read deny BNP any fair crack of the whip).</p>

<p>Listen to what Nick Griffin has to say and not the state-sponsored clowns ^-^</p>
<p>Another fun fact - Take a look at the BBC&rsquo;s election coverage page. They designed it to make parties that have virtually no supporters look like they are major parties and the BNP to be a &#8216;fringe&rsquo; party that has little or no support, just by the way they placed parties in various spots on the page.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing these people don&rsquo;t understand brainwashing techniques. .oh wait&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is just to point out again that non-Brits can donate to the BNP: </p>

<p>Imagine the breakthrough if they&rsquo;re elected to the august British Parliament. Across the West, particularly in the English-speaking world, the message that the deathmarch of PC-multiculturalism is not inevitable might penetrate the silencing and smears. It&rsquo;s something to hope for, at least. </p>
<p>The USA won&rsquo;t recover at all until Americans, too, have a real choice like the BNP.</p>

		<p>I think Griffin could benefit from this. Not by being perceived as a victim, but by having time to polish his presentational skills, prepare for his appearances and avoid serious gaffes (unlike Gordon Brown). </p>
<p>Compare this with Nick Clegg&rsquo;s (Liberal Democrat) sudden fame following his first appearance on the Prime Minister&rsquo;s TV debate. In my opinion, he&rsquo;s getting far too much exposure and inconsistencies in his arguments are attracting negative comment.</p>
<p>Too much exposure and the novelty wears off - &#8220;Oh him again!&#8221;</p>
