			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Barnes, Fox News, April 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The spreading violence of the drug wars along the Mexican border may have one unintended consequence. It could upend efforts to curb illegal immigrants by giving Mexican border-crossers a tool they never had before: a valid claim for political asylum.</p>
<p>For decades, immigrants coming from Mexico were denied asylum because Mexico was a stable and relatively peaceful democracy. But that is changing now.</p>
<p>Last week, at least 30 Mexicans from the town of El Porvenir walked to the border crossing post at Fort Hancock, Texas, and asked for political asylum. Ordinarily, their claim would be denied as groundless, and they would be turned back. Instead, they were taken to El Paso, where they expect to have their cases heard.</p>
<p>No one doubts that they have a strong claim. Their town on the Mexican side of the border is under siege by one or more drug cartels battling for control of the key border crossing. According to Mike Doyle, the chief deputy sheriff of Hudspeth County, Texas, one of the cartels has ordered all residents of the town of 10,000 to abandon the city within the next month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities fear that an incident might spark a mass exodus by the residents of El Porvenir that might cause them all to surge across the border at once.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If political asylum is granted and made available to a large section of the Mexican population, immigration experts say, it could have implications far beyond El Porvenir. They say it could open the floodgates for a new wave of immigration from Mexico, much as allowing Chinese to seek political asylum because of China&rsquo;s one-child policy created a huge migration when it happened. After that ruling, tens of thousands of Chinese boarded boats and planes and told immigration officials they were seeking asylum because they were allowed to have only one child. Most were granted immigration papers and allowed to stay. Even those who made spurious claims were granted a hearing and often simply disappeared.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Shuya Ohno of Reform Immigration for America, even if hundreds or thousands of Mexicans sought asylum because of the drug wars, it is not likely that many would get it. &#8220;It is a hard case to make and very few succeed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Often it requires that those committing repression or threatening harm admit to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, he said, it is likely if that if thousands of Mexicans made the claim, &#8220;it would stress the system incredibly&#8221; as well as delay their deportations. He said that the immigration court system is already overloaded and often staffed by volunteers just to keep it moving, and that if it was flooded with asylum claims it would be in danger of failing.</p>
<p>Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) {snip} said that making a political asylum claim available to Mexicans along the border could result in a swamping of the already overloaded system and bring it to a grinding halt. &#8220;Once an avenue of appeal is opened, then it will become used&#8221; he said. And not just by those who qualify, but by thousands who don&rsquo;t.<br>

<p>Well, my first question in response to that &ldquo;humanitarian&rdquo; bit of simpering hysteria is, why were not every white: man, woman, and child, in the &ldquo;New South Africa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Zimbabwe&rdquo; in the 1990s let in as refugees into this country?</p>
<p>After all, we in the West and the USA in particular, took an obnoxiously safe and sanctimonious pleasure in destroying those two thriving countries of white civilized Africa. Oddly, no one ever batted an eye or publicly declared alternatives to obliterating (through de facto force and de jure sanctions) these countries and their white populations. Now, they are Marxist &ldquo;utopias&rdquo; of multicultural fantasy and genocidal reality. </p>
<p>In this context, how does Mexico compare:</p>
<p>It has lived off of and brazenly abused, the USA from the 1960s and onwards;</p>
<p>Its sociopolitical and criminological problems, are of the Mexican&rsquo;s own making;</p>
<p>And, the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; feeders and breeders they have sent us endlessly already, enrich none but our own homegrown: Reds, traitors, plutocrats, and diversity bureaucrats! </p>
<p>I have no sympathy whatsoever for these &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; and Latinos.&rdquo; They are enemies of: my country, themselves, and therefore of myself and sanity in general. They invade our country, bankrupt whole states (such as California,) and demand a legitimacy of acceptance, that even the most embittered Rhodesians and Afrikaners would not ever have the gall to ask for. This is simply because to Rhodesians and Afrikaners ignorant arrogance, is as alien to them, as &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; emphatically should  be to any nonwhites living in our lands, be they: duplicitous refugees, &ldquo;the undocumented,&rdquo; or &ldquo;migratory&rdquo; alien marauders and terrorists. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>Every non-white that is encouraged to enter this country adds to the greater possibility of civil strife.  I could cite facts and figures, but it isn&rsquo;t necessary.  Common sense and everyday experience is all an astute person needs to know that is true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve maintained for the last ten years that it isn&rsquo;t necessary for opponents of this tribal mish mash to do anything to actively combat the situation, because it will deteriorate all on its own.   Can anybody deny severe deterioration has taken place these last ten years?</p>
<p>It has, of course, and it will continue to do so.  Fractious, tribal societies by their very nature are doomed to fail.  No multicultural society in the history of the planet has succeeded and this one will be no different.  </p>

		<p>This is a tough one.  I definitely do not want any more Mexicans coming to this country unless they do it legally; and yet, I do see that the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t of Mexico has failed to keep its common citizens safe, and they are in constant danger from the drug cartels.  That is a terrible state to have to live in, and it does make sense to apply for poltical asylum here or elsewhere.  I am just wondering where the end of it is going to be.  Something is going to have to be done about the ineffectual guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t of Mexico - it is causing problems for everyone.</p>

<p>NO, Pedo this is not a tough one! I don&rsquo;t want them here legally or illegally! What do you want another MEXICO? This is what we are getting by allowing all the millions here now! Just look at the drug wars and murders in our own country by these Mexicans that come here &#8220;legally and illegally&#8221;! </p>
<p>WE have to stop the insanity NOW because it is almost too late as it is with nonwhites outnumbering Whites in their own country! What do people want? AMerica turned into a 3rd world hellhole? That is what we are allowing. It is the PEOPLE of those countries that allow their own countries to fall. Are we going to do the same? </p>

		<p>Ranger states: &#8220;No multicultural society in the history of the planet has succeeded and this one will be no different.&#8221; - Exactly. I am in full agreement. It appears the end result of any multicultural experiment is to have ethno-centric tribes living in armed encampments, which, may actually end up not being such a bad thing.  Such a result could accomplish several things, for example: If Blacks had their own homeland here in America, they could then live without the ever-present oppression (however they define it) by White folks, and thus get on with solving whatever problems they have by themselves.  If Whites had such an Ethno-centric area, they could live without the ever-present oppression (however they define it) by Black folks.  The Hispanics have taken back a large part of the South-west already, the only question there is where to place the true border fence/wall. Not sure how it will all end, but propects seem rather grim for the long term survival of the Nation of the United States.</p>

		<p>I agree whole heartedly with John PM&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
this soft white culture that seeks to befriend everyone is terribly naive and dangerous.  The do-gooder mentally actually causes much more harm than good&hellip;..  the african starvation cycle is perpetuated by do-gooders who send food and medicine and then there are more and more people who can&rsquo;t take care of themselves&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  and what our do-gooders did to South Africa and Rhodesia is now reaping the whirlwind&hellip;..  not for the do-gooders unfortunately but honest hardworking people&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..  soft white culture will be the death of many of us&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Please, posters, do NOT tell the invaders to go home and apply correctly. We don&rsquo;t need anyone else. We have millions of illegals breeching our borders, the government brings in 100,000 foreign workers each month and then we are hosts to all the dregs of society who can get here with one excuse or the other. What we do need, outside of deporting all illegals, is a moratorium on all immigration until we get out the financial mess we&rsquo;re in. Americans are expected to compete with people who can live ten to a room and take lower wages than we can exist on. Washington could care less. While illegals kill and commit other crimes daily, the murder of the rancher in Arizona has lighted a spark. Maybe if we yell long and loud enough, someone will hear us. The biggest crime, to me, is having to force our elected representatives to do the right thing. As long as they can elicit voters from the illegal alien supporters and belly up to the public trough, they&rsquo;re happy. If nobody rocks the boat, w&rsquo;re in for a h  &mdash;  l of a ride when Obama waves the magic wand of amnesty over the criminals from the south.</p>

		<p>#4 - tactless, no this is not a &#8220;tough one&#8221;. Are we suppose to take in everybody in the world that live a hard life because of their own peoples doing? If you look at a globe, our country is really not that big. We don&rsquo;t have the land mass or the finances to help everyone in need, nor should we. If their country has gotten so bad that they have to flee,that&rsquo;s THEIR fault,that&rsquo;s THEIR problem! Maybe if they had no easy way out and were forced to stay, they&rsquo;d get mad enough to change their country. Same with foreign aid to places like Africa. It&rsquo;s been a begger nation for as long as anyone can remember. All aid to these black holes [ pun intended ] should be stopped immediately, time to sink or swim folks.

		<p>This is an outrage..asylum is reserved for oppressed citizens fearing their own government, not drug gang violence. Mexico has degenerated into a corrupt, dangerous narco-state but it is up to the people to take back their counrty. If these asylum-seekers succeed, the loophole will open the floodgates to untold millions coming here&hellip;.it will be the death knell of the USA.</p>

I believe immigration should be outlawed, period.  If we need more people, we can set policy and do whatever is needed to increase our native born.  If within the population women choose not to have children, then we&rsquo;ll die on our own or modify our culture and policy to encourage a higher birth rate.  But whatever the result, it would be of our doing, and not death by immigration. </p>
