			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News, April 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Officials in New York have identified two strains of simian foamy virus in wildlife imported as food  &mdash;  known as &#8220;bushmeat&#8221;  &mdash;  from three primate species: two mangabey monkeys and a chimpanzee, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). All of these animals are also endangered.</p>
<p>Preliminary studies show that humans can contract simian foamy virus, but its long-term effects remain unknown. Could another AIDS-like epidemic therefore be on the horizon? The WCS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others are working now to prevent that from happening. A symposium called &#8220;Wildlife Conservation and Human Health&#8221; is taking place today at Rockefeller University.  </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Inspection and health officials have seized hundreds of samples of wildlife and wildlife products coming through luggage and mail parcels through main entry points for both people and goods into New York City and the United States.  Samples have been taken from at least 14 species, including great apes, monkeys, rodents, and bats.</p>
<p>In addition to the simian foamy virus, the officials have also been testing for flavivirus and filovirus, but those results haven&rsquo;t been released yet. More than 70 percent of zoonoses, which are diseases that affect both animals and humans, stem from human contact with wildlife.  </p>
<p>&#8220;The movement and mixing of humans, wildlife, and domestic animals as part of the illegal global wildlife trade encourages transmission of disease and emergence of novel pathogens,&#8221; said William Karesh of the Wildlife Conservation Society&rsquo;s Global Health Program. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, more than one billion individual animals were imported into the United States from 2000 to 2004, along with over 11 million pounds of bushmeat and other animal products.  </p>

		<p>Now I know where the idea for that song came from. &#8220;Great big globs of greasy grimy gopher guts, mutilated monkey meat, little birdy&rsquo;s dirty feet, all stirred up in one big bloody treat.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess you could throw a bat or two in just for extra flavor. We never did find out exactly what the Colonel uses.</p>

		<p>This Michael Fay a few years ago walked across the Congo, a trek called the megatransect. He surveyed the wildnerness, the jungle, as he went. Amazingly, he found, much to everyones surprise, large hummocks that were once used for agriculture and enormous piles of cola nuts, 2,000 years old. That whole area of central Africa, what has been up to now thought to have been pristine jungle and rain forest, 2,000 years ago was heavily populated and clear for agricultural purposes. What happened to all the folks? The thought is that some disease came out of the jungle and wiped them out. Mother Nature has a way of protecting herself, the Gaia hypothesis, and preserving life on the planet. If that means killing a goodly portion of mankind, so be it. Some disease transmitted from animal to man was the culprit? Could be.</p>

		<p>What is surprising too about bushmeat is that is more expensive that fish, pork, beef, chicken. The common meats are cheaper and easier to get than the bushmeat. Gamey flavor attracts the newcomers [immigrants] who want a taste of the old country. Endanger us all in the process.</p>

		<p>Wishful thinking&hellip;but no.</p>
<p>It will not be the new AIDS.  The reason why has a name: vaccine.</p>
<p>The HIV is quite special due to the fact that it attacks the captain of the immunologic ship, the T4 cell. Any other biological aproach of any other virus, can be given a profylactic vaccine. <br>
So the new AIDS can only come from another virus attacking the T4 cell. </p>

Yes this is an interesting phenomenon.  One often sees it when Feminism runs headlong into Multiculturalism, and feminism takes a back seat.  From what I can tell, to the &#8220;liberal/progressive&#8221; multiculturalism is the ultimate trump card.  Environmentalism and Feminism always take a back seat to Multiculturalism.   </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious. Eventually, they will corner a weak, injured or young specimen and do what comes naturally. <br>
Then the drums will go through long distances, spreading the news of exquisite taste, abundance and low risk. <br>

<p>Leprosy, the contagious skin disease evoking thoughts of biblical and medieval times, is now making its mark in the United States, and many believe the influx of illegal aliens is a main factor. </p>
<p>&#8220;Americans should be told that diseases long eradicated in this country – tuberculosis, leprosy, polio, for example – and other extremely contagious diseases have been linked directly to illegals,&#8221; Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., told the Business Journal of Phoenix. &#8220;For example, in 40 years, only 900 persons were afflicted by leprosy in the U.S.; in the past three years, more than 7,000 cases have been presented.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;This emerging crisis exposes the upside-down thinking of federal immigration policy,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;While legal immigrants must undergo health screening prior to entering the U.S., illegal immigrants far more likely to be carrying contagious diseases are crawling under that safeguard and going undetected until they infect extraordinary numbers of American residents.&#8221; <br>

And those are just the viruses.   How about parasites like brain worns and bedbugs, which are now being seen more frequently? Hotels say there is now a bedbug epidemic, when they were thought to have been nearly eradicated not so long ago.</p>
