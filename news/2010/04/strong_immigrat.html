<h1>Strong Immigration Needed to Fix Pension System: Conference Board </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Press, April 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Canada will have to increase the number of immigrants allowed into the country by about 100,000 per year in order to boost productivity and help pay for pensions, the Conference Board of Canada&rsquo;s chief economist said Tuesday. </p>
<p>The government will have to implement a very active immigration policy to grow the workforce, increase the number of workers making pension contributions and help offset the effects of an exodus of baby boomers from the labour market, Glen Hodgson told an audience at the Board&rsquo;s 2010 Summit on the Future of Pensions. </p>
<p>Hodgson predicted slow labour force growth in the coming decades, meaning there will be fewer workers contributing to pension plans but more retirees drawing from them. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re a much older country, we&rsquo;ll have fewer workers coming in to feed the system &hellip;  that&rsquo;s going to suck the life out of our economy. Slower labour force growth means slower economic growth,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Governments and the business world are struggling to head off a potential crisis borne of a rapidly aging workforce that is not putting aside enough for retirement. Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty is currently on a cross-country tour to talk to Canadians about how best to reform the pension system. </p>
<p>As an older population and smaller families become the norm, immigrants  &mdash;  about 250,000 are currently allowed to enter every year  &mdash;  will be the only source of population growth in Canada at some time around 2030, Hodgson said. </p>
<p>While strong immigration alone will not reverse Canada&rsquo;s aging trend, it will help keep population growth stable around one per cent per year. </p>
<p>Hodgson said governments will need to implement policies that boost productivity, including developing an integrated immigration policy, investing in a more skilled workforce, and increasing the labour force by encouraging older people to work longer. </p>
<p>&#8220;There may be some sort of informal market developing, where people formally retire and then informally find a way to (keep working),&#8221; Hodgson said. </p>
<p>The average retirement age in Canada is exceptionally low, he said. But Canada should aim to avoid measures such as those taken in Japan to raise the age at which workers can access government-sponsored retirement plans, Hodgson said. </p>
<p>While the recession impaired Canada&rsquo;s growth potential, a survey conducted by the board earlier this year found that the economic downturn did not significantly affect the age at which Canadians plan to retire, Hodgson added. Only one person in three said the recession made them think about delaying retirement. </p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t rely on the recession as an excuse for prolonged retirement &hellip;  we can&rsquo;t rely on the backlash from the recession as a way to keep our economy growing,&#8221; Hodgson warned delegates at the think-tank&rsquo;s annual pension summit. </p>
<p>Pension plans have been beset by years of funding problems and were further savaged by the recession. Concern about retirement income has soared recently, in part because savings took a big hit with the downturn in financial markets last year but also because fewer companies offer defined-benefit plans that pay a set amount on retirement. <br>

		<p>Except that immigrants bring their older family members, and most of them are a net-drain on the economic system thus creating an endless spiral by which more third world immigration is &#8220;needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny how all these white countries were doing just fine without non-whites for centuries.  The canadian economy doesnt NEED non-whites.  </p>

		<p>Robert &#8220;no stimulus money for white contractors&#8221; Reich recently said the same thing, stating that Mexicans will be needed to pay the social security of aging Americans,  A old example of how far removed these people are from reality. once Obama gives amnesty to the Mexicans, their population will double in about 10 years after they get done petitioning their millions of relatives, so then they will have the votes to opt out of social security. &#8220;we don&rsquo;t got to pay no old YT&rsquo;s&#8221; will be the motto of the Reconquista Party </p>

		<p>This would be laughable if it weren&rsquo;t so sad.  In two hundred years Canada will be colored and Islamic.  I&rsquo;m not saying those characteristics are bad in themselves (certainly arguable here on AR), but White Christian Canadians will be either the extreme minority or extinct.  Japan, with their current restrictive immigration policy may have some economic problems along the way, but in a thousand years, they will at least still be Japanese.  This &#8220;economy first&#8221; mentality we have in the West will be the cause of our eventual death as a viable race.</p>

		<p>Does anyone remember how George Washington died? They bled him to death. At that time it was {deemed}, &#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t resist that word,&#8221; proper medical treatment to bleed the bad blood out of someone. Do I see a remarkable similarity here or what. Not to worry really, what with rationed socialized medicine, most of those old codgers will likely not be around too long anyway. Incidently this will apply to those of us here in AmeriKa as well. After all the king did just recently say, you elderly folks are going to [have] to sacrifice for the younger ones, and sadly he only lies when he says he&rsquo;s going to do something good for this country. Long live the king  &mdash;   you know the rest of that phrase.</p>

		<p>So does Bernie Madoff now run Canada&rsquo;s pension system?  What the Conference Board of Canada is admitting is that people do not fund their own pensions, instead, the actuaries assume an ever growing pyramid of people so that each pensioner can be supported by many workers.  In short, the pensions are intergenerational Ponzi schemes, like our own Social Security.</p>
<p>Since no country can have an exponentially growing population forever, sooner or later the pension schemes have to be fixed so that each generation pays its own way.  I vote for sooner.  Politicians always vote for kicking the can further down the road.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re smart enough to notice the population drop and call for more immigration but they are not smart enough to notice that as the number of immigrants increases the number of white children being born goes down. Immigration could even be the cause of the population dearth in the first place. According to them, those with a sensitive view, there&rsquo;s nothing to do but wait (and look forward) to a time when whites are a small enough percentage of the population that their decline and demise wont affect the &#8216;sustainability&rsquo; of a population. </p>

<p>As it&rsquo;s been noted already, it&rsquo;s not the aging of the populace that&rsquo;s going to &#8220;suck the life&#8221; out of Canada. It&rsquo;s going to be all those unproductive, low-income, welfare sucking, criminal  immigrants, their aging parents, and their equally disfunctional children that will do the job (not to say all immigrants are like that, but enough are to wreck Canada). National suicide by demographics. Let&rsquo;s hope that Quebec, a place that seems to be a little more realistic than the rest of Canada, resists this madness.</p>
<p><i>Slower labour force growth means slower economic growth.</i></p>
<p>I have heard almost all of my life that slow economic growth is something to be avoided like the plague. What on earth is wrong with slow growth, or even, God-forbid, stagnation, if economic things are doing just fine otherwise? It always seems like we have to have more of this, more of that, more of everything (like immigration), otherwise things are going to hell, so say the economists. In a world of limited resources (like peak oil, for example) and exploding population, we just CANNOT keep having more and more and more. To think otherwise is just insanity.</p>

		<p>Hardly surprising as far as MSM articles go.</p>
<p>Here in the Peoples Republik of Kanada, statistics proclaiming the soon-to-be minority status of Whites were released. (Something most of you here are familiar with)  Since then the media has kicked into overdrive, putting one spin after another on it, and encouraging more of the same.  You can almost hear our enemies gleefully laughing in the background.</p>
<p>There was very recently this article in the Vancouver Sun:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Rising+diversity+enhance+social+connections+Study/2877761/story.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Rising+diversity+enhance+social+connections+Study/2877761/story.html</a></p>
<p>It tries to argue how &#8220;recent findings&#8221; show that diversity is actually GOOD for big cities, instead of how it destroys trust and hinders community building.  Like most articles of this nature it is heavy on the fluff and short on the specific details. (like how the data was cooked) Expect to see WAY more of this tripe in the near future.</p>
<p>And all the while, the genocide against Whites continues&hellip;</p>

		<p>Is this supposed to be a &#8220;pension system&#8221; or a pyramid scheme? I mean what is Canada supposed to do? Keep importing immigrants until the entire world is within the Canadian border, paying taxes to support the pension cost of the earlier immigrants who pay the pension costs of their predecessors?</p>
<p>Canada has never been noted for display of government intelligence&hellip; but hits a new low with this one.</p>

		<p>Strong immigration only fixes the pension system if immigrants are more skilled and productive than the local people. They also need to contribute more to the system than they take out. Nowhere in the western world is this the case. </p>
<p>Nowhere.</p>
<p>Immigrants are simply driving down the standard of living for everyone.</p>

		<p>Most commentors understand that no nation can continue to grow in population to sustain social programs.  It is clearly impossible to grow in numbers without dire consequences.  The U.S. is growing rapidly with uneducated people primarily, which will result in a nation not-able to nor not willing to defend itself.  Exactly what the elite have planned.  Once down, how quickly will we become the serfs in a world government? </p>

		<p>The UK House of Lords Select Committee on the economic impact of immigration debunked this &#8216;pension bomb&rsquo; argument. The immigrants themselves get old - they need to raise the pension age.</p>
