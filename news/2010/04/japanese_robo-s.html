<h1>Japanese Robo-Suit Promises Superpowers for Greying Farmers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, April 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While Robocop and Iron Man can dodge bullets and crush villains, a new powered suit from Japan promises its elderly users more modest powers, such as pulling up radishes without getting a backache.</p>
<p>Unlike its heavily-armed Hollywood counterparts, the Power Assist Suit aims to make life easier for Japan&rsquo;s army of greying farmers.</p>
<p>The metal-and-plastic exoskeleton boasts eight electric motors that amplify the strength of the wearer&rsquo;s arms and legs, as well as sensors that can detect movements and respond to commands through a voice-recognition system.</p>
<p>Professor Shigeki Toyama and his team developed the power-enhancing suit at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, and Toyama plans to set up a company to start producing the futuristic outfit by the end of the year.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;If the farmer bends over to grasp a radish, his back will be firmly supported,&#8221; said Gohei Yamamoto, one of the students working on the team, as he recently demonstrated the suit on his university campus.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;A brief vocal instruction will instantly straighten the rods along his legs, giving him the power he needs to pull the vegetable without effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifteen years in the making, the robosuit will soon hit the market in Japan to help ageing farmers harvest their fruit and vegetables while avoiding backaches and nasty cramps, its developers say.</p>
<p>Japan, with a low birthrate and a high life expectancy, is facing a demographic crisis as its population rapidly ages and shrinks.</p>
<p>Industrial robots have long been common in Japan, and robo-suits are making inroads in hospitals and retirement homes, where they can help carers lift patients or aid in physical rehabilitation exercises.</p>
<p>But with two thirds of the country&rsquo;s farm-workers already over 65 years old, the agriculture sector is a potentially lucrative untapped market.</p>
<p>The suit should hit the Japanese market in 2012, when it will initially retail for about one million yen (11,000 dollars), a price tag its makers hope to halve if the device is mass-produced, the team said.</p>
<p>There are however no plans so far to sell the suits overseas.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;I doubt that the suit would sell in Europe and in America, where foreign migrants workers often perform farm-related tasks,&#8221; Toyama said.</p>
<p>The team has developed a heavy-duty 30 kilogram (66 pound) model, for lifting big loads and pulling vegetables out of the ground, and a 23 kilogram version designed for lighter tasks such as picking grapes.</p>
<p>The robo-suits can reduce the user&rsquo;s physical effort by 62 percent on average, the inventors say. When bending knees the muscular activity is reduced by half, and the suit can also take most of the strain out of crouching.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;We conducted a survey of 102 people for the latest model, asking what part of the body hurt when they picked grapes,&#8221; Yamamoto said. ../../../../__8220.css;Most farmers complained about aches in their arms, necks and lower backs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suits are already tough, but soon they will also become smarter.</p>
<p>By the end of the year Toyama plans to start working on augmented reality goggles on which useful information could be displayed for the farmer, in much the same way as data is projected onto the inside of a fighter jet&rsquo;s cockpit.</p>
<p>Useful information might include how ripe the grapes are, or the user&rsquo;s heart rate and calorie consumption, said Toyama. ../../../../__8220.css;The goggles would tell you for instance how long you&rsquo;ve been working and when you should rest.&#8221;<br/>

<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t you know that American exceptionalism is passe&rsquo;? Get with the times. Now the American way is deference to those weaker than us. That&rsquo;s what a good noble American believes. In fact, your respect for the Japanese dishonors the neo American way, since they are a first world nation. Now if you were to heap praise onto some pygmies eating grubs in the jungles of Africa, that&rsquo;d be acceptable.</p>

		<p>Arent there ANY young people in Japan? There must be at least enough to harvest the crops. The Japanese at least are doing it better than we are. We will keep importing Mexicans to pick our crops until our population density is as bad as it is in Japan,all so we can have ../../../../__8220.css;affordable&#8221; beans. </p>

		<p>It is not like whites aren&rsquo;t capable of doing this either.  When white society is homogenous, I personally think it is overall better than what the Japanese create.  I admire the Japanese for maintaining their great culture, but they are no more innovative than whites.  Let&rsquo;s wait and see what they do over the next decade or so.  If they make major break through discoveries in any area, then I will be convinced that they are just as innovative as whites.  Right now I am only seeing their ability to innovate equally to whites to a small degree, but I haven&rsquo;t seen any evidence that they innovate BETTER than us.</p>

		<p>To Blaak Obongo, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Japanese are not only clever inventors, they&rsquo;re capable of facing racial realities without flinching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are hitting the nail square on the head here!</p>
<p>As is noted in the above article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike its heavily-armed Hollywood counterparts, the Power Assist Suit aims to make life easier for Japan&rsquo;s army of greying farmers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the USA is developing this technology too, but not for our commercial or even domestic security needs. We are developing it for future &ldquo;empire&rdquo; warfare on the global stage, even while our mulatto &ldquo;savior&rdquo; concludes &ldquo;abolishment&rdquo; focused nuclear arms accords with our main geopolitical rivals that make The Kellogg–Briand Pact of 1928, look like a diplomatic and military act for veneration. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all; and of course, all the best to you Blaak Obongo,</p>

<p>The Japanese are being allowed to be racist, just like all other non-white nations are.  Look around, it is only white dominated nations that have cow-towed (Chinese concept thrown in for humor) to the notion of diversity and multiculturalism.</p>

		<p>To Poster #4, Japan is verified one of the most productive societies in the World, and even surpasses most European countries (perhaps with the exception of Germany). South Korea also does well, and China will most likely follow suit once it&rsquo;s developed. These groups are not the enemy. I sense that on some level you believe that only Whites are capable of innovation, but that is certainly untrue. Worrying about who&rsquo;s ../../../../__8220.css;better&#8221; is a waste of time.

		<p>Devices like this have been being developed and tested for a while by now&hellip;..  but either proved to be impractical at the moment, (in other words, not quite useful in the real world) or maybe too costly and difficult for the general public</p>
<p>I remember, a very well-known university (prefer not to specify which university) recently worked so hard and completed developing a robot that nicely folds bath towels&hellip;</p>
<p>and they proudly presented the robot to international conference on robotics and animation 2010&hellip;.</p>
<p>the duration for the robot to nicely fold a towel, on average?</p>

		<p>The reference to the population density of Japan is misleading.</p>
<p>On the map, Japan is not a small country; Honshu is the size of England plus Wales, Shikoku is the size of Wales again, Hokkaido is the size of Austria and Kyushu is the size of Denmark.</p>
<p>However, much of Japan is mountainous and the &#8216;Arse of Japan&rsquo; - Ura-Nihon - has brutally cold and prolonged winters.</p>
<p>I might add that in the eighties various employers&rsquo; federations in Japan were lamenting the dreadful fact that the politicians and a misunderstanding and suspicious public ensured that they were unable to import ../../../../__8220.css;long-term trainees&#8221; tied to one employer - rather like the Indians who have undercut wages and prospects in Silicon Valley and similar places.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the Japanese could develop the Urban Defense Suit for Americans unfortunate to live in the inner cities.  It could incorporate such features as body armor, night vision goggles, and the ability to deliver a 50,000 volt low-amperage shock to anybody touching the wearer.  Additional options, such as Mace sprayers and CN gas dispensers could be made available.  It could also feature flashing HELP WANTED signs front and back to further discourage approaches from inner city dwellers.</p>
<p>The Urban Defense Suit could be manufactured and retailed for under $1,000 I&rsquo;m quite sure.</p>

<p>Well, this is absolutely correct. These prospering Asian societies are mostly homogeneous and mono-cultures. One basic race, religion, tongue, culture, history, etc. That is not to say there are NOT ../../../../__8220.css;minorities&#8221; but they are small in number and to an American may not even be recognized as a ../../../../__8220.css;minority&#8221;!</p>
<p>And are kept that way. Judiciously so too. They DO NOT WANT to make a mess of their nations as the U.S. has made a mess of ../../../../__8220.css;its&#8221; own culture and society.</p>

I doubt they concern themselves with that. Why should you?&#8221;</p>
<p>You miss my point. You aren&rsquo;t being fair by comparing multicultural Western societies to homogenous Eastern societies and then coming to the conclusion that Eastern societies are more advanced.  The only reason the East is ../../../../__8220.css;better&#8221; ( I think you are stretching it by including China and Korea), is because it is homogenous.  Too many people on here forget that it was quite recently that whites were the great innovators of the world.  I haven&rsquo;t seen Asians do much more than copy and improve what we do.  </p>
<p>As John PM pointed out, our military and space program have been using this technology for years.  You just don&rsquo;t hear about it as much.  I wish people on here would examine all the facts before acting as if Asians are such ../../../../__8220.css;clever innovators&#8221; as if they are implying that whites can&rsquo;t do the same &hellip;that was my whole point.  I never said that ../../../../__8220.css;only whites innovate&#8221; which is what you accused me of.  I just haven&rsquo;t seen enough evidence that Asians are just as good at it quite yet.</p>
<p>And before anyone mentions ../../../../__8220.css;China&rsquo;s glorious historical achievements&#8221; I would like to remind everyone that every reliabele non-PC book on the history of science and technology gives Europe credit for at least 75% of the world&rsquo;s achievements.</p>
<p>I am entitled to voice my views on this topic on here and I will continue to do so.  The liberal academia puts down white civilization all the time, so it really disturbs me when people on here make a huge issue over how I stick up for whites when comparing them to Asians.  Why don&rsquo;t you spend more time going after the liberal multiculturalists who post on here?</p>

		<p>Just today, Courney, I was having lunch with a very distinguished astronomer from Caltech.  We were talking about education and the emphasis that schools place on grades and standardized tests, and he told me that Caltech turns away most of the applicants with perfect SATs, because they don&rsquo;t put much store by tests.  They look for indications of original thinking.  He thought that having an educational panic over the higher test scores of Asia was foolish because we&rsquo;ll never match the Asians at test taking.  To him, creativity and our way of managing creative people were our strengths, and we should leave intellectual drudge work to other countries.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always a trade off between capital and labor.</p>
<p>When labor is in short supply, you substitute capital for labor, which has the added benefit of accelerating the rate of technical progress.  In the United States prior to the Civil War, labor was in short supply despite immigration.  Combined with the availability of land, this created the incentive for American leadership in the mechanization of agriculture.</p>
<p>Now, what was the impact of Irish mass immigration to the United States in this same period? Little or none on what was then the country&rsquo;s primary industry, agriculture. The Irish, unlike the Germs, formed ghettos in cities and did not seek out land, even though one of drivers behind the Irish diaspora was the unavailability of land in th home country.</p>
<p>In the United States of the 1990s, our economic boom was at least partially driven by two chap factor inputs - labor and oil. Hard to remember, perhaps,  but oil was $12/barrel for most of the 1990s. Similarly, it was in that same decade the illegal labor supply increased by an order of magnitude.  Clearly, it was easier for US business to buy labor and oil cheap, rather than invest in capital and technology where these two factors inputs figured most - manufacturing, construction, food production and distribution.</p>
<p>Of course, we need to remember that legalized abortion&rsquo;s aggravated the US labor shortage in the 1990s. Millions of Americans who would have been born in the 1970s and of working age in the 1990s had been instead discarded, and thus were not available for adding to the native labor force.</p>
<p>For this complex of reasons, zero immigration is an option is neither necessary nor sufficient for the US. I do not believe the US would be better off if the immigration of the 19th century had been prohibited by law. So, we need a policy that ensures the debate on immigration is returned to legislatures, and removes from a black market.  </p>
<p>Mind, however, that deporting all the illegal residents of the US would not increase the number of jobs. This sudden drop in the labor supply would see an increase in production cost to business. American employers would respond to the labor shortage by reducing head count and increasing capital investment. But, this would transfer wealth to those who produce capital equipment used in the labor intensive industries - Japan, Korea, and increasingly China. There is no guarantee that of a resurgence of American manufacturing of this type of capital equipment. More likely, in my opinion, there would be an effort to find alternate sources of supply in India, whose English speaking population has proven it can produce capital goods.</p>
<p>So, while we know of the public bad from unregulated immigration, let&rsquo;s be careful of what we propose as our short and long term response, and understand the consequence.</p>
<p>PS<br/>

		<p>Japan&rsquo;s agrarian areas have many of the problems they do in the US and Australia.  It is difficult to convince young people to stay and work on family farms, as they tend to leave for good jobs in the cities.  Family farms there are generally handed over to eldest sons, who then have trouble finding a wife willing to accept that sort of lifestyle.  Accordingly, young Japanese farmers frequently marry women from China.</p>
<p>Some of the smaller islands in the Japanese archipelago have been completely abandoned, as the older farmers have died off and their children moved away.</p>
