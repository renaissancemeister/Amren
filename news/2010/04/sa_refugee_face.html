<h1>SA &#8216;Refugee&rsquo; Faces Ejection </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kim Hawkey, Sunday Times (Johannesburg), April 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Race &#8220;refugee&#8221; Brandon Huntley is having a hard time convincing the Canadian government of his &#8220;plight&#8221; as a white South African. </p>
<p>The 31-year-old made international headlines in August when the Canadian immigration board granted him refugee status after it found him to be a victim of crime, genocide and affirmative action back home. </p>
<p>Huntley  &mdash;  a Cape Town-born martial arts fanatic  &mdash;  was declared a refugee after claiming he had been robbed, and stabbed seven times by attackers, who had called him a &#8220;white dog&#8221; and a &#8220;settler&#8221;. </p>
<p>Following a massive backlash, the Canadian government announced it would go to court to seek a review of the decision. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the federal court in Toronto was set to hear an application by the country&rsquo;s minister of immigration, Jason Kenney, for a review of this &#8220;plainly wrong&#8221; decision. </p>
<p>Lawyers spent the morning arguing a procedural issue as Huntley, in papers before the court, suggested the Canadians wanted a review of his case purely due to political pressure from South Africa. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear to objective observers that the applicant&rsquo;s motives in commencing this judicial review were purely political and in reaction to complaints by the South African government,&#8221; Huntley&rsquo;s lawyer argued in papers before the court. </p>
<p>Kenney, however, rubbished Huntley&rsquo;s claims, accusing him of going on a &#8220;fishing expedition&#8221;. </p>
<p>The minister noted that the South African&rsquo;s reasons for seeking a review were not the subject of the court matter. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth remembering that the reasonableness of the board&rsquo;s decision is what is at issue in this judicial review application,&#8221; Kenney said. </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Canadian department of immigration told the Sunday Times that there were several reasons why Kenney was challenging the decision. </p>
<p>&#8220;The board&rsquo;s decision contained several errors, including an error in its finding that Mr Huntley did not have access to state protection and an error in equating random acts of violence that Mr Huntley claimed to have experienced with persecution due to his race,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Huntley also argued he had been sidelined by South Africa&rsquo;s affirmative action policies, had been subject to persecution and genocide by the black majority who hated all whites and wanted them &#8220;stomped on like ants&#8221;. </p>
<p>He added that, as a white person, he would &#8220;stick out like a sore thumb&#8221; in South Africa if he had to return home. </p>
<p>But the Canadian government minister did not buy any of this. </p>
<p>In court papers Kenney agreed that crime was a &#8220;huge problem&#8221; in South Africa, but he said citizens from all racial backgrounds were victims, and not just whites, as Huntley claimed. </p>
<p>Kenney also said that Canada, too, experienced random acts of violence. </p>
<p>The minister&rsquo;s lawyers argued that the immigration board&rsquo;s acceptance of Huntley&rsquo;s claim that the South African police could not be trusted as &#8220;a majority of them are black, conveys this rather disturbing view&#8221;. &#8220;This view is unsupported &hellip; it largely rests on the board&rsquo;s jaundiced assessment of the country conditions.&#8221; </p>
<p>Regarding Huntley&rsquo;s complaint about affirmative action, Kenney said Canada had absolutely no problem with South Africa&rsquo;s affirmative action policies, which suggested that justifiable &#8220;social changes were afoot in South Africa&#8221;. </p>
<p>Kenney said Canada applied similar policies by, for example, giving preferential rights to aboriginal fishermen. </p>
<p>He also said that Huntley&rsquo; s work experience did not entitle him to lofty aspirations. </p>
<p>&#8220;Even if one accepts that the affirmative action policy has limited the career advancement and/or job opportunities for some white South Africans, it is still incongruous that a high school graduate with the respondent&rsquo;s work experience  &mdash;  a bartender, sales technician, parking-lot attendant and cleaner  &mdash;  has been denied any opportunities commensurate with his qualifications.&#8221; </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Judge Yvon Pinard postponed the matter, but did not set a return date. </p>
<p>Huntley&rsquo;s lawyer did not respond to attempts to contact him. </p>
<p>Before his refugee application, Huntley had made various attempts to stay in Canada, including trying to join the army and marrying a Canadian citizen. <br>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t want to embarrass the fine government of South Africa, a government made up of members, many of whom struggled against the terrible white run racist regime, that should not even be spoken of, formerly in SA. Heck, why not give dissidents of That government the Nobel prize and a nice welcome wagon into the city?</p>

		<p>Jason Kenney is a racist.  </p>
<p>If Huntley&rsquo;s application is rejected, it is because of political pressure.</p>
<p>If it is accepted, it&rsquo;s because the Judge rules by the facts and not by what&rsquo;s best for his career.  Anyone can tell you that whites are disproportionately victims of crime in SA.  Just bring out the &#8216;more than 1 out of 40&rsquo; white farmers dead since the end of apartheid statistc.  It&rsquo;s practically genocide.</p>

		<p>If the Canadians were smart they would open the door for white southern Africans to solve their low population growth problem.  Jason Kenney is an up and coming Conservative Party politician.  Here is being more politican than conservative.</p>

<p>Like America and South Africa, Canada has affirmative action programs that favor racial minorities over whites. Mr. Huntley is out of luck, if he is looking to escape affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Once again we see how the Canadian government hates white people, as do most Western governments.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Even if one accepts that the affirmative action policy has limited the career advancement and/or job opportunities for some white South Africans, it is still incongruous that a high school graduate with the respondent&rsquo;s work experience &mdash; a bartender, sales technician, parking-lot attendant and cleaner &mdash; has been denied any opportunities commensurate with his qualifications.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So Kenney is certain that a bartender, sales technician, or parking lot attendant would never be racially discriminated against.  How does he know?  Or is he just saying that he doesn&rsquo;t care about the plight of the peons who do such work, he being above it all?</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t even a story up here in Canada.  There was no massive backlash, just a few indignant letters to the editors from the rabid left.</p>
<p>The Conservative government is a minority government.  As such, they take great pains not to give the opposition a chance to play the race card.</p>
<p>Mr. Huntley cannot be seen to be given favourable treatment because he is white, at the same time as the Canadian government is trying to restrict Mexicans, Roma, Tamils, and other Third Worlders.</p>
<p>The opposition would make Huntley a poster boy for their race-baiting tactics.</p>

		<p>If this refugee was a non-white, the Canadian government wouldn&rsquo;t even think of deporting him. The fact that they&rsquo;re denying this man refugee status is just another example of how Canada is full of radical anti-white left-wing zealots.</p>

		<p>Fact is that there is a worldwide agenda of multiculturalism and egalitarianism. The goal of these liberal agendas are to enable the formation of a one world Marxist system. </p>
<p>In Marxism you have a homogeneous mass of people where everyone is equal and no classes exists. Liberalism today, is the new undercover Marxism because, they both promote the same ideology, namely egalitarianism. The people have been so dumbed down that they do not realize any longer what liberalism represents. <br>
Liberalism is an attack on the West. It attacks the pillars of a society, namely politics, religion, education and economics.<br>
To conquer a society you have to divide it. Thus the liberalists create victim groups. Feminism, racism, homosexualism etc. etc. all these are elements aimed at dividing a society.</p>
<p>Marxism can only be achieved if nationalism is killed.</p>
<p>South Africa or the &#8220;rainbow nation&#8221; as the multiculturalists so proudly refer to it, is the flagship of multiculturalism.<br>
To allow Huntley refugee status can not be allowed under any circumstances, because that would imply that multiculturalism is a failure and this cannot be allowed.</p>
<p>Everything that promotes multiculturalism is highlighted and everything that proves it is a lie is hushed. </p>
<p>The lies of course have to get bigger and bigger.<br>
They funny thing is that the truth is the mightiest of weapons as it will always in the end be the victor.</p>

		<p>The ANC government whispered in the Canadian government&rsquo;s ear and they overturned his asylum status. I wonder if Mr Kenney would be prepared to go live South Africa, in a house without fences or armed response? Let&rsquo;s see if he&rsquo;d last more than one night. How he can compare Canada&rsquo;s crime to the barbaric crime in SA is unforgiveable.</p>

		<p>Well he did prove how difficult it is for a white South African to get out of this African hell hole. Atleast the comments telling South Africans to just leave might stop. Anyway, he has my respect for atleast putting his money where is mouth is and doing something rather than just talk. </p>
<p>Hope the review sees through the objections and does allow him to stay. Yeah, only when pigs fly right? The only way for South African whites to really survive is to stop the infighting and unite for themselves. May I see this in my lifetime!</p>

		<p>I recall reading not too long ago that the Western prairie provinces of Canada were considering importing Southeast Asian farmers to work the sparsely-population fields. Why not give this White South African a crack at it, along with his fellow countrymen, who have already proven their ability to make a living in less-than-ideal circumstances?

		<p> To: Concerned South African (or anyone else for that matter)<br>
 <br>
 I&rsquo;m curious how whites make it over in South Africa?  What are your rights as far as owning firearms, private property rights, the ability to start your own business, free speech, etc.?  </p>
<p>How is your constitution set up?  Is it strong enough to protect minority rights?  I think it&rsquo;s obvious to many of us that you have a hostile anti-white government, but do minority political parties have any power in your country (as they do in the United States for example)?</p>
<p>What about daily living?  What are the neighborhoods like?  Do most white, Asians, coloreds, etc. live in segregated neighborhoods?  How about your work environment?  Going to the mall?  What is it like?  </p>
<p>Also, many posters say white South Africans should just leave, but why should you leave.  It&rsquo;s your home.  Do you and most white South Africans feel comfortable enough to stay (even if you could get out)?  I have read that hundreds of thousands of Brits have moved to SA to retire.  Why do they feel comfortable enough to move there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about daily life in your country. <br>
 <br>
Thank you.  <br>

<p>Thank you for the interest. I will try and answer to the best of what I know and also try and keep this post brief.</p>
<p>I personally feel that white South Africans still have it to easy for majority to want to pack up and leave. We still have many ways to both create jobs and find jobs that Affirmative Action and Black Economic Empowerment cannot stop. This is one of the reasons I am very proud to be a white South African as we can be very crafty when needed.</p>
<p>With regard to firearm ownership. We as civilians can own firearms. However, it is extremely difficult to renew or obtain a firearms licence and the painful experience of both the mismanagement and length of time it takes, leads to many handing in their current firearms. I wish I could scream from the highest mountain in South Africa to tell them to stop handing them in and to stock up. There is also a government funded compain to stop firearm ownership and a drive to get as many handed in as possible. The reason for this, according to the media and the ANC, is the dramatic crime in South Africa. According to our head cop (General now lol), most crimes are committed by the use of guns stolen from the public. However, the use of many R5 and R4 rifles in crimes can tell any non PC person that they cannot get these from civilians. R4 being the old standard issue for SADF soldiers and the R5 being the standard issue for police. Funny how police rifles land up in criminals hands???</p>
<p>On to your next question. Our constitution is set up to &#8220;protect everyone&#8221;, however it does allow for &#8220;fair discrimination&#8221;, read AA and BEE, but doesn&rsquo;t allow for &#8220;unfair discrimination&#8221;, read calling blacks names and hiring according to merit. The constitution came into effect with the 1993 interim constitution which was latter ratified by the 1996 constitution after the 1994 election. For the most part the constitution is very well set up. However, once again it is the enforcement of it that makes the difference. The ANC will enforce it when it is in their best interest but not when the victim is white. The 3000 or more farmers killed bears witness to this.</p>
<p>As I have said before, South Africans still can make a living so many will still not want to leave. However, this limbo is soon coming to an end in my opinion and South African whites will have to stand up and fight. This is the reason why I read blogs and gather information that can hopefully wake enough people up so that we can survive in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks again CSA </p>

		<p>Would also like to add that there are many no go areas for whites in South Africa, much like the USA. Communities are still very segregated, with middle to upperclass elite blacks moving into the white areas.</p>
<p>With regards to our work enviroments. I myself have one face I keep for work and the other that I show around my friends and family. Much like the media says one thing but mean another. It has become a necessity to act and behave in a certain manner towards blacks to allow them to believe that you are indeed anti-white and pro-black. I myself do not stoop to this low low level of promoting blacks ahead of whites but I do keep my comments to myself while at work or out in public.</p>
<p>I hope my two comments in response tell you atleast some of what we do to stay here and not attract to much attention to ourselves. At the moment, blogs like this and others serve as a way for many of us to show the world why certain things like Apartheid became a necessity. You may not agree with the methods that South Africans used pre 1990 but atleast now you can see what we were up against and hopefully the Western World can come up with some resolution that allows White South Africans their own land in the borders of South Africa free from corruption and violence that plagues the Current New South Africa.</p>
<p>Thanks CSA</p>

		<p>19  &mdash;  Anonymous: please read much of what you ask for on my web-site at www.spainvia.com.  We lived in SA for 24 years escaping because we have British as well as SA nationality, but we were sick to death of legally carrying licensed 9 mm pistols (now stopped for civilians) and hearing of friends being robbed raped and murdered by these people.  Not all blacks are so though as I had several black friends who were just as worried about the future under a Marxist trained terrorist government with probably the same fates as Zimbabwe etc.  Also take a look at www.africancrisis.org.  But white Africans are an endangered species in Africa even though the killing and eviction of them by the black Africans will mean starvation and poverty for the masses of ordinary black Africans.</p>
<p>I upset the liberals when I tell them that they have been very clever to stop Apartheid as without the whites, the blacks will die out gradually especially if foreign aid is refused.</p>

		<p>In 1994, in the period of a few months, 800,000 Rwandans were murdered in an African genocide. In total, 4 million died in that conflict. Let&rsquo;s say things really get out of hand here in South Africa, as they did in Rwanda, and the 60 million blacks turn on the 4 million whites like the Hutus and Tutsis did in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Would the West also look away and deny us remaining whites asylum? I am afraid it looks very much like that could be the case. The liberals and the left won&rsquo;t be able to offer us asylum, lest it appears that they admit to the reality of the inherent criminality of the African. What&rsquo;s a few million dead Boers and Afrikaners compared to the left wing&rsquo;s obsession with their religion of non-racism and multiculturalism? </p>

		<p>&#8220;In court papers Kenney agreed that crime was a &ldquo;huge problem&rdquo; in South Africa, but he said citizens from all racial backgrounds were victims, and not just whites, as Huntley claimed.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, enough.  However, you&rsquo;re missing the point, Mr. Kenney.  Who are the PERPETRATORS?!?  Why have well over 1,000,000 Whites (and counting) left South Africa since the ANC came to power?</p>
<p>&#8220;Following a massive backlash, the Canadian government announced it would go to court to seek a review of the decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>A &#8220;massive backlash&#8221; from whom?  I don&rsquo;t buy it!</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;The board&rsquo;s decision contained several errors, including an error in its finding that Mr Huntley did not have access to state protection&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where was this so-called &#8220;state protection&#8221; for the over 3,000 White farmers murdered since 1994?  What about the untold number of White females raped/sexually assaulted since then?</p>
<p>More leftist, anti-White rubbish!  </p>

<p>I have to disagree with you about your prospectus for black genocide, self-imposed or otherwise.  Their numbers are greatly increasing, in spite of the worsening economic problems in ZA or Africa in general.  I think the reason for the paradox is that to have a high population growth, you need to have as high a percentage of your population as possible being child-bearing capable girls and women.  Because this violence is almost exclusively man-on-man, it doesn&rsquo;t kill any child bearers.  Humans, even what some would consider the &#8220;lowest&#8221; among us, are hard-wired to do as little damage as possible to women of child-bearing age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used an illustrative example before here at AR   &mdash;   Imagine there are 10 people on earth.  All are capable of reproduction, and for the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s extend the typical 9-month human gestation period out to one year.  And assume all births are singles.  If among those 10 people, nine are women and one is a man, then you can have 9 new human beings in the world ever year.  Population goes to 19 after one year, 28 after two years, etc.  Now flip the scenario   &mdash;   of the 10 people on Earth, one is a woman and nine are men.  You only get one new person a year.  And it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if eight of the nine men are murdered, you&rsquo;ll get one new person a year.   </p>

		<p>He sounds like an economic refugee to me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a farmer, trying to do the best with his land in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s underqualified, not well educated, and likely decided that working as a bartender or parking lot attendant would get him a much better standard of living in Canada than it would in S.A.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Kenney also said that Canada, too, experienced random acts of violence.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p><br>
This is true: Canada does experience random acts of violence. And here&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s doing those acts of violence in Quebec: </p>

<p>Two French names, one English name. As for where the other seven of the Top 10 murderers, rapists and narcotics traffickers in <i>la belle province</i> came from, well, your guess is as good as mine. </p>
<p>Immigration Canada&rsquo;s fatwah against Brandon Huntley is just more lib-left &#8220;cultural equivalence&#8221;, i.e. an illogical comparison desperately attempting to make the Third World seem no worse than the First, and blacks no worse than whites. </p>
<p>Under previous Liberal govts in Canada, such cultural equivalence and moral cowardice re the plight of white Saffers would merely have been business-as-usual. But Jason Kenney was initially touted as the most conservative Conservative in Ottawa, the one member of PM Stephen Harper&rsquo;s minority govt who&rsquo;s &#8220;to the right of Harper himself.&#8221; Minister Kenney is turning out to be quite a disappointment to us conservative Canucks. </p>

		<p>To give you an idea of the horrors that we face on a daily basis. In the paper this morning 15 blacks attacked a family living on a smallholding outside Polokwane. They tied the husband (40) up and then beat him to death. Then 5 blacks gang raped the mother and they seriously assaulted the 4 year old daughter.</p>

<p>Can you even begin to imagine the horror story we live in?</p>

You state: &#8220;Because this violence is almost exclusively man-on-man&#8221;. This is not the case in South Africa. Usually the men, women and children are tortured and murdered. Women usually raped. It is unusual for the women and children to escape alive.</p>
<p>TODAY&rsquo;S NEWS: http://tinyurl.com/y7amofg</p>
<p>A man was beaten to death while his wife was gang raped and their four-year-old daughter seriously assaulted in the early hours of Saturday morning, Limpopo police said.<br>
&ldquo;It is believed a gang of 15 men entered the family&rsquo;s house on a plot at Dalmada, outside Polokwane at 3.30am,&rdquo; said Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe.<br>
The gang tied up the 40-year-old man and beat him to death.<br>
Five men raped the man&rsquo;s wife before turning on the couple&rsquo;s four-year-old daughter and seriously assaulting her.<br>
No arrests have been made.</p>

		<p>Concerned South African (or anyone else):</p>
<p>Thank you for answering my questions.  I have just a few more questions for you.  </p>
<p>What keeps the ANC from taking your businesses, private property and from forcing you to leave your country?  A constitution is only as good as the politicians that swear to protect it.   </p>
<p>How much power do the 4.4 million whites have in your country?  Do whites for the most part feel comfortable staying in South Africa?  I have always been intrigued by your country&rsquo;s race relations since it&rsquo;s the only country I know of where whites are a substantial (in the millions) minority and blacks are the majority.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your time.<br>
