			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Presha, The Grio, April 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About three and a half hours west of New Orleans, there&rsquo;s a town  &mdash;  Mossville, Louisiana. It&rsquo;s a predominantly African-American town. It&rsquo;s been that way since the 1790s.</p>
<p>The town is still tiny. There are only about 800 people at its core. But it&rsquo;s no longer a farm town. Fields were replaced with houses and chemical plants. Fourteen plants now surround the small community.</p>
<p>Decades after the first chemical companies moved in, Mossville residents are convinced that these plants are making them sick.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Dorothy] Felix has lived in Mossville most of her life. Her hometown has long served as a refuge for blacks who weren&rsquo;t welcome in other communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were here before these plants came and we were here because this was a Afro-American community and we didn&rsquo;t have anywhere that we could go. We had to go somewhere were we felt safe and away from all the racial problems that were going on. This was the place for us. Now they&rsquo;re forcing us to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spend some time with Mossville residents and you&rsquo;ll quickly find that everyone has a cousin, neighbor, sibling or parent with cancer or respiratory illness.</p>
<p>Delma Bennett and his family have lived in Mossville for decades. He took theGrio on a tour of his neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have three times the amount of dioxin in our bodies in comparison to the rest of the communities in America,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;That you have this racial disparity of these people of color getting the short end of the stick, that&rsquo;s a human rights violation and that&rsquo;s racism,&#8221; said environmental lawyer Monique Harden. &#8220;The pollution in the air and in the environment and in the soil is having an effect on the health of the residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All throughout Mossville there are remnants of empty driveways. They are plots of land where houses once stood. Now they&rsquo;re taken over by brush because testing showed the land was toxic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cancer experts say that when you find concentrations of cancer in one community, it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint the origin of the disease, but the large number of cancers in a town like Mossville may be the result of contamination that comes from a shared resource, like air or water.</p>
<p>Local plants deny any involvement in endangering the health of Mossville residents. Also, the Environmental Protection Agency has not found any of the companies guilty of regulatory violations.</p>

		<p>In San Francisco,the black racist Nation of Islam has been whining for years about serpentine rock dust being pulverizesd and getting in the air in Hunters Point by a construction  company called Lennar.And the blacks who live near the allegedly deadly rock dust take the bait, and say that they have respiratory problems, even when they dont.Im glad to say that even Mayor Newsom doesnt believe it, and no money has been paid yet.</p>

		<p>What a first class load of hooey! What this article fails to disclose is that Mossville is not a town but an unincorporated neighborhood of nearby Westlake! The area is sandwiched between Westlake and Sulphur and the children go to Westlake schools. There is no Mossville police, fire or utilities or anything that makes a town. I grew up in Maplewood, a subdivision that was built for refinery workers in the 1940&rsquo;s and is about a mile if not less from Mossville. The way this article reads is if Mossville was some sort of isolated town far from anywhere and a refinery fell from the sky. In reality the refineries in the area needed access to the river and had to locate in that area. I still have many relatives and friends in the area and my husband and I are planning to relocate to either Sulphur or the nearby Lake Charles area. As far as illness goes befor the refineries cleaned up in the late 1980&rsquo;s several of our neighbors had health problems and my own mother died in 1988 of a brain tumor- she had been born and lived most of her life in the area. I do not attribute the illnesses to pollution but I will say that after all the blacks started complaining they had all sorts of money thrown at them. Houses were moved at company expense or owners were paid full market value. They complained that they did not have full access to highway 90 and the city built a new railroad crossing. No white family in Maplewood complained and no offers were forthcoming. If you google &#8220;Mossville&#8221; you may see a picture of a man in a cemetery with smoking flares behind him. This pic is fake. The cemetery is in nearby Sulphur several miles from the area and with no view of the refineries. This article is a good example of trying to get sympathy for blacks for supposed racial pollution where none exists.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s just one example of literally hundreds of subjects that are complained about in a multiracial nation, especially if blacks are involved.</p>
<p>Everything is discussed through the prism of race, which causes a constant state of useless agitation.</p>
<p>It leaves only the white race to try to solve the country&rsquo;s problems that affect the nation as a whole, because all the non-whites are concerned SOLELY with tribal matters&hellip;.NOTHING ELSE!</p>

		<p>The article also stated that the black neighborhood was settled in the 1790&rsquo;s but that is only true for the neighboring community of Lake Charles which was not even incorporated until 1867.</p>

		<p>Probably some nicer neighborhood in either Sulphur or Lake Charles. This wasn&rsquo;t  some sort of horrific ghetto. Even with the supposed pollution if I were black I would choose Mossville over Detroit, Chicago or New Orleans.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how old you are JR but when I grew up in Sulphur in the 70&rsquo;s and early 80&rsquo;s I never heard the word &#8220;Mossville&#8221;. Even when I went to school at McNeese state in the early 1990&rsquo;s nobody used &#8220;Mossville&#8221; either. It was always Sulphur or Westlake. You are right it is about the money. A home in Mossville would probably not top 100,000 but on a good day (especially during the real estate boom) a house in nearby Maplewood could go for as much as 250,000. </p>

		<p>Dumb. I lived in Saco, ME, for a while, which was 98% White and right next to a paper mill. The smell was awful and I&rsquo;m sure the cancer rates were through the roof. I think Maine has the highest cancer rates in the country. </p>
<p>These blacks are whining, as usual.</p>

		<p>Funny thing was there were Whites who lived just as close to other refineries in the are and there was no mass movement to move them out. There was a group of kids at my school whose homes were up against the refinery fence. We swam and played in water that had been contaminated by refinery run off (they have since cleaned up the Lake)and none of us were seriously ill. To be fair there was one case of leukemia in my elementary school. When I was a child there was an older woman who my grandmother occasionally helped who literally lived within the gates of the refinery, refusing to sell her property. She could have been a very wealthy woman but she held on to her property. She had lived there for some 30 years and was over 80 years old and had never been sick even though she had lived that close to the refinery since it had been built. </p>

The liberals help perpetuate their whining, too.  They say, &#8216;There, there.  Everything wrong that happens to you is white people&rsquo;s fault.  Nothing is EVER your fault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with Katrina.  The whites there were ready in case something like that happened, yet the blacks weren&rsquo;t.  Same thing with Haiti.  The Haitians needed help and government assistance, yet when it happened in some other non-black part of the world they made it fine on their own.</p>
