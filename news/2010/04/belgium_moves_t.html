<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1262545/Belgium-set-European-country-ban-burka.html">Belgium Moves to Become First European Country to Ban the Burka</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Belgium is on the verge of becoming the first European nation to ban the burka.</p>
<p>A parliamentary committee agreed yesterday to outlaw the wearing of face-covering veils in public. The full Parliament will vote later this month.</p>
<p>Under the proposals, women could face a week in prison or a fine for wearing a veil in public.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 650,000 Muslims in Belgium  &mdash;  6 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>The text of the new law does not specifically mention burkas but makes it illegal for anyone to wear clothing &#8216;that covers all or most of the face&rsquo; in any public place.</p>
<p>Left-wing MP Denis Ducarme left no doubt the rules were targeting-Muslim extremists.</p>
<p>He said after the vote by the home affairs committee: &#8216;This sends a very strong signal to radical Islamists.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The French-speaking liberals who have proposed the law argue that an inability to identify people presents a security risk and that the veil is a &#8216;walking prison&rsquo; for women.</p>
<p>Daniel Bacquelaine, the bill&rsquo;s chief promoter, said the ban might also be used against potentially violent demonstrators who covered their faces.</p>
<p>He estimated that only a few hundred women in Belgium wore facial veils, but said it was a rising trend.</p>
<p>The MP said Belgium did not wish to follow the &#8216;bad examples&rsquo; of Britain and the Netherlands, where he said many Muslims lived in separate communities.</p>
<p>The proposal is expected to become law as early as June as it has the support of all five parties in the coalition government. But opponents may appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>There have been debates over banning the burka in France, Switzerland and Italy.</p>
<p>This week France&rsquo;s highest administrative body said a full burka ban, which is supported by all political parties, could violate the French constitution and European law.</p>
<p>Brussels has been linked to Islamic extremist terror operations a number of times since September 11. In 2003, 18 men were convicted of involvement in a terror cell with links to Al Qaeda.<br>

		<p>One has to be very careful in believing this sort of announcement.  It has been the habit of European Whites to acquiesce to the demands of Muslims although Belgium is a little less likely to do so.  The Belgians seem a little bit tougher in this regard.  France on the other hand is not likely to ban the burka.  They seem to give in far more easily to Muslims&rsquo; demands.</p>

		<p>Lets not forget that passing a law and enforcing it are two different things.</p>
<p>I applaud Belgium&rsquo;s decision regarding the burka. However, heavy handed tactics might be needed to enforce it.</p>

		<p>Some Europeans seem to get very upset about this veil thing. To me, that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.   Myself (while I&rsquo;m not in favor of it) I don&rsquo;t greatly care about it either. Could this be a red herring?</p>
<p>All this fuss over veils and burkhas seems to be a distraction away from the real issue&hellip; which is that Moslem settlers ARE THERE at all! That is the issue which needs to be addressed. Deport the Moslems, cut off immigration,  then the veils and burkhas would take care of themselves. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the politicians try to appease the public by giving the impression that they are doing something about the matter   &mdash;  -  while the immigrants continue to pour in!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not veils that bother me; it&rsquo;s large numbers of Moslems.</p>

		<p><i>Belgium is on the verge of becoming the first European nation&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Belgium is not a nation, but two nations.  Or, rather, 2.1: Flemings, Walloons, and a handful of Germans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see Fs and Ws bury the hatchet, if only for a moment, so they can address a greater threat from outside.  Let&rsquo;s just hope they don&rsquo;t go after Christian nuns as well.</p>
<p>That this is happening in the belly of the EU beast makes it all the richer.<br>

<p>A 2000 pound truck bomb in front of a public building is a MUCH stronger signal of muslim &#8220;outrage&#8221; <br>
 And from Awakened &#8221; France on the other hand is not likely to ban the burka. They seem to give in far more easily to Muslims&rsquo; demands&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a reason the French have historically been called &#8220;surrender monkeys&#8221;</p>

		<p>The burka is only a symptom, it is not the problem.  Hiding the symptom only allows the problem to grow worse, which is, I gather, the intent of the Belgian government.</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;d call this an encouraging sign of a spine growing in Europeans, but inviting in millions of Africans and arabs-muslims by the hordes-is rather like being swallowed up to the neck by an anoconda, and then proclaiming  it&rsquo;s time to avoid  man-eating snakes.<br>
Europe is far past dead. </p>

		<p>when are whites the world over going to wake up and realize that if they don&rsquo;t band together and start kicking the non-whites OUT and back to where they came from, we will lose our countries forever to this endless tide of invading hordes&hellip;this is not a freaking joke, this is the future and our children&rsquo;s future&hellip;uh I am so mad now I am not going to be able to fall asleep and I have to get up in the morning&hellip;</p>

		<p>If I remember correctly, Belgium is the country where a few years back a survey was done in one of the &#8220;provinces&#8221; or whatever the equivalent is there, about the rampant &#8220;racism&#8221; present.  </p>
<p>Apparently up to 60%+ of white youth said they didn&rsquo;t have a non-white friend and they didn&rsquo;t want one either.</p>
<p>Smart kids.  Someone please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I believe I read the article here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a PR stunt to sell racist colonialism to the natives who are its victims.  When Muslims make up 51% of the Belgian population what difference will this ban make?   White-hating racism among the elites, so deep that it has become genocidal,  is the problem, not radical Islam. </p>

		<p>This could be a good start. If the burka ban goes through Parliment and is signed into law and the Muslims throw fits and start rioting, burning cars, attempting to blow up the PM and King, you know, the sorts of things they are famous for, perhaps the Belgians will start taking tougher and tougher stands until finally that say enough already and boot them out.</p>

		<p>Hold the rejoicing.</p>
<p>The leftists who hold sway in much of center politics aren&rsquo;t resisting Islamic invasion.   They just naively think they can &#8216;liberate&rsquo; Islam from its more radical trappings, like genital mutilations, burkas, jihad and honor killings.</p>
<p>They task they&rsquo;ve set for themselves is to soften Islam into a hybrid, Westernized member of the European family.  This is the hubris of the ideological left - they think they have unlimited powers to change the world.</p>

<p><br>
Very true. Burkas aren&rsquo;t the problem; Moslems are the problem.</p>
<p>But going deeper still, as Bud says, we find  the underlying problem that allows all of this (and even encourages it).  That is the white-hating, genocidal elites who are in charge, and who are bent upon race replacement in white countries, come hell or high water!</p>
