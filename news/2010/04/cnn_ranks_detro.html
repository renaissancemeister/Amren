<h1>CNN Ranks Detroit among Most Dangerous Cities in World</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George Hunter, Detroit News, April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Third-world countries have nothing on Detroit when it comes to crime, according to a list released this week by a national news organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New Orleans was the only other city in the United States to make the dubious list.</p>
<p>Lifelong Detroit resident Sherman Hayes, 79, was not surprised to hear that Detroit was considered among the most dangerous cities in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;On just my street (Lakewood), the other day a man shot a 2-year-old girl during a dope deal; I saw the car zoom by the house,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then, a few months ago, a father shot his son in the head over money. That happened just down the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CNN&rsquo;s list was based on things like internal stability and effectiveness of law enforcement, along with official crime statistics and media reports.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the list, which was presented by CNN in no particular order:</p>
<p>Baghdad, Iraq</p>
<p>Caracas, Venezuela</p>
<p>Detroit</p>
<p>New Orleans</p>
<p>Juarez, Mexico</p>
<p>Karachi, Pakistan</p>
<p>Cape Town, South Africa</p>
<p>Moscow, Russia</p>
<p>Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo</p>
<p>Beirut, Lebanon<br>

		<p>After Hurricane Katrina, someone held up a sign in New Orleans that read, &#8220;America&rsquo;s Baghdad.&#8221;  How appropriate it would have been for someone in Baghdad to answer by holding up a sign that read, &#8220;Iraq&rsquo;s New Orleans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pray tell, what&rsquo;s the difference between Detroit and a third-world country, anyway?  It&rsquo;s not the city or country that is third-world, it&rsquo;s the people therein.  You can&rsquo;t build a first-world city or country with third-world people.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Third-world countries have nothing on Detroit when it comes to crime, according to a list released this week by a national news organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how can this be? </p>
<p>The superior black originators of humanity are about 90% of the population there. They run everything in that city and do so with the dignified panache and understated ingenuity, that is so intrinsic to their race. Or put another way, they just didn&rsquo;t integrate Detroit into &ldquo;the dream,&rdquo; they became an evermore reoccurring version of it with each passing decade since 1967.</p>
<p>Call me an abject idiot, but I am really confused here!</p>

		<p>This country is considered a world power and cannot even control cities like Detroit or any other black controlled areas in this country?  Wait until the Hispanics become the majority in this country.  The present level of crime and corruption will look minuscule in comparison.  It will be dangerous everywhere one goes just like in South America.  The Tea Parties are a good start to take this country back!  Scientific, morality, artistic endeavors cannot flourish when a country is dominated by third world genes. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Detroit native living near Amish country in Ohio.  I still have a lot of family in the Detroit metropolitan area.  My mother says it&rsquo;s getting bad.  </p>
<p>My dad once gave my stepsister some advice:  If you&rsquo;re driving through a slum area in Detroit, and you see children outside, do not stop for stop signs, or you might get carjacked.</p>
<p>Before he died, Dad used to tell me what a nice place Detroit was in the 1940s and 50s.  They showed movies in the park.  You could leave your house unlocked, go on vacation, and no one would bother anything.  It used to be a really nice place to live.</p>
<p>Now when I visit relatives, I prefer to take I-275 and go around Detroit and through the western suburbs, rather than take I-75 through it. </p>
<p>You go along Eight Mile Road, which is the dividing line between Wayne and Oakland Counties (Detroit and northern suburbs), and you can tell which side is Detroit  &mdash;  all the &#8220;adult&#8221; shops.</p>
<p>Detroit was pretty bad when I lived in that area in the 70s and 80s&hellip;but not like today.</p>

		<p>Since two of our cities are on a list of only eight &#8216;Most Dangerous&rsquo;, does this mean that we are now, officially, a THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY?  </p>
<p>At least four of the eight are experiencing what I would consider to be ongoing warfare, which, to me, is a good excuse for being dangerous.  Detroit and New Orleans do not have that excuse, and so their presence on the list can only be due to Third-World conditions.</p>
<p>So, really, if one disqualifies only four of the &#8216;war zones&rsquo;, Detroit and New Orleans comprise HALF the list of &#8216;Most Dangerous Cities&rsquo;.  Stated another way, HALF of my &#8216;adjusted list&rsquo; of the Most Dangerous in the entire WORLD&hellip;are in America.</p>
<p>You will notice, too, that the United States is the only nation with more than one City on the list.  China, Indonesia, Brazil, Egypt, and even India, have NONE.</p>

<p>     THIS CAN&rsquo;T BE TRUE! Guns were banned in Detroit, so nobody has guns&hellip;.. the criminals have turned their guns in because of that law&hellip;. how could anybody be shot when we have these great laws?  I can&rsquo;t possibly believe this story&hellip;.. Sarah Brady, say it ain&rsquo;t so!</p>

		<p>I have driven through Detroit many times on the highways.  The place looks like a war zone!  Burnt out and abandoned buildings for miles.  </p>
<p>My cousin used to live in Hamtramck, which is an enclave surround by Detroit, so I&rsquo;ve moved around on local streets a few times.  Desolation and despair are the two words to describe the place.</p>
<p>I once visited Wayne State University, which is in downtown Detroit, and my very old, beat up car was broken into (for a lousy cheap coat!)  I went to Greektown a few times for a good restaurant that was there.  There were like three cops on every corner (no doubt to protect the cash cows that come there for the casinos.)</p>
<p>Detroit is a wasteland, er, ENTER PC POLICE - I mean Detroit is a shining beacon of black majority rule.  If we see waste and desolation, we&rsquo;re just raciss&rsquo; and seeing things in the wrong way.  90% of the population is black.  The rest is latino and Arab.  About 2% are old whites who refuse to move.  </p>
<p>Black run Detroit is a model of how integration can bring &#8216;diversity&rsquo; benefits to every town and city across the nation.  </p>
<p>Prepare yourself for black rule, er, ENTER THE PRO IMMIGRATION FANATICS - Latinos bring such vibrancy and social &#8216;spice&rsquo; to this boring nation.  They are bypassing the cities and going straight for the small towns and suburbs from Iowa to North Carolina.  </p>
<p>They will be the majority outside the cities, while blacks will be the majority inside the cities.  Whites who are properly deferential can live in small, scattered numbers in both places.  (Need those blond girls!) And so the wheels of history turn, but in the future, it won&rsquo;t be us writing the books, oh wait, there won&rsquo;t be anyone reading books in our future.</p>

		<p>&#8220;School bus Nagin&#8221; must be so proud to have his &#8220;chocolate city&#8221; back up and running. Is anyone really surprised to see Nawlins on the most dangerous cities list? Could there be a correlation between the percentage of blacks in a city&rsquo;s population and its crime index? Or am I just being a bigoted racist for pointing this out?</p>

		<p>Hmmm, I notice that nearly all of these most dangerous countries and areas are non-white. But it can&rsquo;t have anything to do with race. Noticing patterns in natural phenomena and extrapolating that data to form reasonable conclusions is scientific until it leads to observation of racial differences. Then suddenly it&rsquo;s &#8220;pseudoscience.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do wonder, however, why Moscow, Russia is on the list. Is it due to difficulties in making the transition to a more free market economy, or do they have their own non-white &#8220;underclass&#8221; there?</p>

		<p>So, where does Gary, Indiana fit into this list of the world&rsquo;s most dangerous cities? I&rsquo;ve driven through both and yes, they qualify for the term &#8220;Horror Show&#8221;. It is rather ironic that the latest version of &#8220;Nightmare on Elm Street&#8221; has scenes that were filmed in Gary.</p>
<p>Both Gary and Detroit look like the dystopian 1980&rsquo;s post apocalyptic films that were a staple for that era. (Terminator, Blade Runner, etc). An overwhelming portion of the black population can&rsquo;t manage a 2 car funeral much less a civilized society. How many other black majority cities are in nearly as bad a shape as Detroit and under report their crime statistics? At least with Beirut, there had been a 35 year religiously based civil war. </p>
<p>I know the following statement may bring a lot of consternation to AmRen readers in Michigan, but maybe it would be a good idea to turn Michigan into an all black state with guards from Michigan City, Indiana to Toledo to enforce it. Governor Granholm seems to have done a wonderful job when it comes to leadership. Michigan is such a shining beacon of fiscal responsibility and a business friendly environment. It would be cheaper to relocate people than to keep paying welfare and the other associated costs. Elect Kwame Kilpatrick as governor and have all-black congressional representation. They would have their own society free of racism and the white man keeping them down. That will be the day. </p>

		<p>Tim,</p>
<p>I may be wrong, but I believe Moscow is known for its organized crime.  Whenever I read about the most dangerous syndicates in the world, Russian gangs are almost always at the top.  So that may be the reason.  I doubt their crime is due to criminals robbing the local liquor (or would it be vodka in the case of Russia) store.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone else will know for sure.</p>

		<p>Sometimes these statistics can be misleading. For example, Cape Town (where I live), is almost certainly the safest South African city for whites - at least for those who can afford to live in a reasonably decent area.  Most of CT&rsquo;s violent crime is within the black and (especially) the &#8220;coloured&#8221; communities. </p>
<p>For whites I think Pretoria (before &#8220;liberation&#8221; the safest) to be the most dangerous.  About 10% of SA&rsquo;s whites live there but the city is surrounded by black townships and squatter camps - white people there are virtually under siege, with at least one being killed every other day.</p>

		<p>To #10 Tim,</p>
<p>Moscow is dangerous if you are a foreigner who barely speaks Russian(or not at all) and has no escort. It&rsquo;s just very different travel destination. The place can be quite intimidating even for Russians coming there. It&rsquo;s a huge city with all the problems that come with being such. There are some problems with Central Asian(ex Tadjik) and Caucasian(from Caucus region, i.e. Georgians, Chechens) populations committing crimes. There are also a problem of corrupt law enforcement who often prey on the guest workers and generally non-native looking people. Which would not be such a bad thing if they weren&rsquo;t so easily bribed.</p>
<p>The main problem is a huge gap between rich and poor. About 3% of population is extremely wealthy, 15% are middle class, the rest are quite poor(by Western standards). They have enough to eat and house themselves(Russia does not have the kind of abject poverty that you see in India, China or Brazil), but not much disposable income. </p>

		<p>My family lived in the Detroit area over 100 years before Detroit was founded in 1701.  We are fast approaching the end of America.  Not the tipping point, the end.  The tipping point came in 1965 with the intentional use of immigration, &#8220;civil rights legislation&#8221;, and countless PC type regulations to &#8220;transform&#8221; America.  Another poster here has it right, the blacks will inherit the urban areas and the mexicans will command the rural areas.  There will be no place for whites.  My relatives, forced out of Detroit starting in the 60&rsquo;s are now under siege in the South, where they sought refuge.  Just one city over from where I live now, the mexicans are 50% of the population and at least that % of crime originates with them.  The rural areas, once safe, are easy pickings for daytime burglers and for home invasionists.  It is no wonder that many of this country&rsquo;s wealthy have bought land in the remaining safe areas of Costa Rica and the like.  Genocide awaits us as we will no longer form a breakwall between most conservative whites and the third world America.  Soon, even legitimate elections will be out of our hands as the minority population swells.  Of course, even prior to that time, elections will be stolen by the political elite tired of waiting on the downfall of America.  So don&rsquo;t tell me that 2010 elections will be our salvation.</p>

		<p>I live in Medellin Colombia 3 months a year. Even with the reputation Medellin has it is 100 times safer than Detroit or Newark or DC or any other heavily majority black city. In MDE I live in the upper class 1/4 of the city called Poblado. Full of museums, resturants, universitys and such, all the things an elite upper class suburb of any american city has, but safer. Yes, I said MDE is safer than US cities, at least the Poblado section. Poblado es a white enclave that compares to Hollywood Cal in looks and class.  Basically all the violence in MDE occurs between the drug/crime factions in the poor barrios. Due to the Bush inspired Plan Colombia, along with a hard line right wing president Colombia has become what could become or is an excellent place for those of us looking for a place to escape. If I were financially able, I would live there full time.  Anyway, the point of my post is to say that in Poblado, a part of MDE which is safe,,, there are basically no blacks at all, well, you may see a handfull if you walk around all day. You cant make the same statement about Detroit!!!  To poster 18 who mentioned Costa Rica. I lived there 5 years before changing to Colombia. CR is not safe, beautiful yes but not safe. The police there are useless and 100% corrupt. Gringos are the target of much crime. I was almost killed just walking down the street. None of my friends who have lived there for any time are free of crimes. Nice place to vacation for a week but you dont want to live there. You need to look a little further south for stability, safety, right wing government, and a good economy.  Kingfish </p>
