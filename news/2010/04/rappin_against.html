<h1>Rappin&rsquo; Against the Right Wing: Can Hip Hop Save Black America?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Scott, Herald-Sun (Durham, North Carolina), April 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the last year, anti-black behavior has escalated from racist propaganda being promoted on radio stations to black Congressmen being called racial slurs and spat upon. All over the country Right Wing racists are rallying thousands of people, while rappers are too busy buying rims for their Escalades to notice.</p>
<p>Since Hip Hop has always prided itself as being the true voice of the black community, you would think that rap artists would be on the front line fighting against these disses to black folks.</p>
<p>Not so.</p>
<p>So far, there have been, relatively, few Hip Hoppers calling out the Right Wingers. This is not to say that there aren&rsquo;t any rap artists speaking out on issues, as there are &#8220;raptavists&#8221; in communities across the country. However, most have heard about the attacks that came upon such political artists such as Professor Griff and Sister Souljah in the 80&rsquo;s/90&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t want the same thing to happen to them.</p>
<p>One of the by products of Hip Hop has been black male rebelliousness. This is why the media were quick to blame incidents of racial unrest such as the Virginia Beach and LA rebellions (riots) of the late 80&rsquo;s/early 90&rsquo;s on the music of groups like Public Enemy. Immediately, the music industry went to work to replace revolutionary Hip Hop with gangsta tales of black on black homicide and chemical genocide (crack sales). During the following decade, since &#8220;racism&#8221; became less overt, the black male aggressiveness generated by Hip Hop was used on other black males.</p>
<p>However, with racism becoming more &#8220;in your face&#8221; over the last year, the &#8220;powers that be&#8221; don&rsquo;t want to risk the fratricidal message of gangsta rap to be misinterpreted as a call to &#8220;fight the power.&#8221; They know that with a change of a couple of words, a 50 Cent song becomes a Public Enemy-like call to organize collectively for political and economic power.</p>
<p>Although, &#8220;gangsta&rsquo;s&#8221; are notoriously, politically apathetic, even the most hardcore thug will become outraged if while flippin&rsquo; the channel between Hip Hop stations, he hears a conservative radio host call him a &#8220;no good bum who will never amount to anything&#8221; and his mother a &#8220;lazy welfare queen.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Should Hip Hoppers, be more than a little concerned that Right Wingers are currently organizing major events across the country from Sean Hannity&rsquo;s &#8220;Conservative Victory Tour&#8221; and Tea Party Express rallies to the upcoming Second Amendment Rally, where thousands of ticked off good ol boys will show up outside of DC locked and loaded on April 19th.</p>
<p>You bet, they should.</p>
<p>Regardless of how one feels about Hip Hop as an art form or pseudo-culture, at this point, Hip Hoppers are perhaps the most capable of organizing a mass resistance against the Tea Party and other ultra Conservatives.</p>
<p>Although, the Tea Partiers are able to organize thousands of people to show up at protests, rap artists have the potential to do the same if they were so, politically, inclined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps, most important, is the Hip Hop vernacular. Just as the Right Wing folks are able to use code words such as &#8220;illegals,&#8221; &#8220;inner city youth&#8221; and &#8220;states rights&#8221; to galvanize their base, rappers also have slang terms to mobilize their fans toward political action right under the noses of unsuspecting Republicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is past time that Hip Hop artists used their collective talents to do more than spread ghetto tales about strippers and drug sells.</p>
<p>This is why I am calling for a Right Wing Rap Attack (www.facebookbook.com/rightwingrapattack), where Hip Hop artists will challenge conservative commentators instead of dissin&rsquo; each other and will organize for political advocacy instead of coming up with new dances.</p>

The writer makes it sound as if whites <i>choose</i> to speak in euphemisms to be devious. Not so, Mr. Scott. Many of us whites would dearly loved to speak about the many, <i>many</i> black-related problems much more forthrightly. Bluntly, even. But PC and the general atmosphere of anti-white bias <i>force</i> us to speak in code. </p>
<p>Believe me, Mr. Scott: If many of us on AmRen were to tell you what we <i>really</i> think of people like you, without holding anything back, you and every other black would soon wish we&rsquo;d go back to euphemisms. </p>

		<p>Rap was supposed to help black children learn math.  Epic fail.</p>
<p>Rappers were supposed to patch up the feuds among each other after noted hip-hoppers Tupac Shakur and Biggy Smalls were murdered in 1996.  Epic fail.</p>
<p>If this is what they&rsquo;re going to use to counter the Tea Party Movement with, I suggest they give up and spend their &#8220;talents&#8221; (such as it is) to make money to buy more chrome spinners for their Escalades.  And more Escalades, too   &mdash;   That&rsquo;ll keep GM in business.</p>
<p>The main reason this won&rsquo;t succeed is that most hip-hoppers can&rsquo;t organize a wet mop to save their lives.  The only reason they are said to have &#8220;talent&#8221; is because white (some would say not really &#8220;white&#8221;) record label execs and music promoters market their malodorous rain forest noise to equally moronic black and (unfortunately a lot of) white young people.   A lot of black professional athletes have &#8220;talent,&#8221; too, but really none outside of professional athletics   &mdash;   which is why so many of them are bankrupt within a few years after retirement. </p>
<p>BTW, nobody spat upon a Congressman nor called one a racial slur.  Andrew Breitbart&rsquo;s $100,000 challenge to produce a video proving this still hasn&rsquo;t been met.<br>

		<p>Well I suppose it could work but you&rsquo;d have to pay the rappers to do it because there&rsquo;s really nothing in it for them to do it for nothing.  You&rsquo;d also have to pay the attendees as well or give them a pack of cigarettes or bottle of ripple like ACORN did when they got people to register to vote.</p>
<p>I notice the media likes to label people like Sean Hannity, Sarah Palin or even John McCain as right-wingers when nothing could be further from the truth.  Let&rsquo;s just call them what they are; controlled opposition, the faux right, neocons or ______(fill in the blank) for the foreign lobbies.     </p>

		<p>These hip hop retards influence nobody but blacks and most of them in that community are on a train headed for destruction.</p>
<p>The only way they could possibly survive is to get off ASAP, but that won&rsquo;t happen, so as they arrogantly chant, rap and strut, they just can&rsquo;t see that concrete wall just up ahead.</p>
<p>All of them are committing slow suicide.</p>

		<p>Even a viable message will be rendered useless as hip hop &#8220;artists&#8221; turn the message into as many shades of &#8220;Blame whitey&#8221; they possibly can.  This genre of performance can&rsquo;t be brought under control and often backfires violently at every attempt.  <br>

		<p>Hiphoppers are no different than the other young and moneyed crowd in L.A. - they ALL are meth and cocaine freaks, some do heroin, and some merely drink far in excess of what is healthy.  In other words, here in this part of the world, if you&rsquo;re young and have money, you spend it on getting high.  So if this person thinks hiphoppers are capable of getting clean and sober long enough to lead any kind of meaningful opposition to conservatism, I believe he&rsquo;s in for a great disappointment.  These bozos couldn&rsquo;t lead a dog across a street successfully, let alone an organized counter to groups as sophisticated as conservatives tend to be.  The rappers could probably go in with AK47&rsquo;s and murder the conservatives; that seems to be what they&rsquo;re best at, and is the limit of their creativity.  If each of the rappers was required to serve 2 years in the Marine Corps, you&rsquo;d end up with MEN - not the immature, poorly behaved bad BOYS that the hiphoppers are.  Loud mouths and brutal acts aren&rsquo;t admired by anyone except other rappers, and that&rsquo;s all these people have to offer.  </p>

This is a case where I could actually feel for intelligent blacks. </p>
<p>I am not certain if I have had any experience with the Herald-Sun before, but I really got to believe this is a level of kowtowing without equal. Could any publication really be this desperate for contributors? </p>

<p>I work with the U.S. military here in the muddled east and I can tell you, blacks bring their ghettos with them when they join and officers, (read that as WHITE officers) dare not, at risk of a career, do anything not PC towards blacks. Blacks in the Marines are, admittedly, better than those in the Army which I think must be about 45% black now and 40+% Hispanic!!</p>

		<p>1 Anonymous:  I tend to think &#8220;inner city youths&#8221; is a euphemism of the left, not the right.</p>
<p>6 SoCARealist:  I wish I could agree with you, but if you sent these rappers to the Marine Corps, (and you&rsquo;d have to force them in; the Marines still have some semblance of standards) it would only hurt the Marines.  Aside from the fact I think they&rsquo;re incorrigible, the PC brass would pander to their every depravity.</p>
<p>As lame as I think some of these tea party leaders are, they&rsquo;re way smarter than the hip hop crowd.  But what I fear is that if these hip hoppers came to a tea party with bad intentions, the tea party leaders would want to get pictures of the crowd with the rappers in it to tout the TPM&rsquo;s &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>

<p>I suspect Hollywood selects for these types.  A girl I know from HS has a career in Hollywood and she has no morals, but she does have an H habit.  Coincidence?  I doubt it.  Hollywood has its pick so it can select the manipulable from among the otherwise &#8220;qualified&#8221; (attractive); drug addicts top the list of the manipulable.</p>

		<p>This is actually both effective and dangerous.  It is another round of rhetoric in the propaganda war on whites.  It&rsquo;s claims need not be factual for it to succeed.  It does not need to be logical, or even coherent, because none of these things is relevant to the target audience.  </p>
<p>False claims, illogical and even incoherent screeds are perfect fuel for whipping up the anti-white mob.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous in post #1 above makes an excellent point. I&rsquo;ll join in by assuring Mr. Scott that if we were to speak our minds, he and his like would feel their blood run cold. Am I supposed to consider rap and hip hop to be music?  How about just plain old noise?  Didn&rsquo;t someone (another left-winger) set out to prove some years back that Beethoven had black ancestry?  I&rsquo;ll believe that on the same day that you see me going out to buy rims (the ones that spin!) for my Chevrolet.</p>

		<p>Nobody yelled &#8220;ni**er&#8221; and nobody spat upon any of the Congresscritters as they filed in to betray the country with the Marxist vote on health care.  Nobody did.  That was a lie told by the Pelosi crowd.  It has been PROVEN to be a lie.  But of course, the main stream media keeps repeating the lie as if it was a fact, and of course semi-retarded blacks believe the lie because they WANT to believe it.  Just as they believe the ridiculous lie that AIDS was &#8220;created&#8221; to decimate black populations, that heroin was introduced into black cities for the same reason, and that a black man invented the light bulb.  Moreover, the idea that black rappers could be an instrument to counter conservatives and family values movements is so delusional as to be comical.  Rappers PROVE the conservative and race realist arguments by their very existence and the lyrics of their rapper garbage.</p>

		<p>Has anyone ever noticed how these rappers tend to suddenly die of  an overdose? I have always believed that their handlers get tired of their demands for more money and more bling and eventually make sure they overdose on purpose. There are always more blacks who would love to step into the shoes of the deceased and rap. The line for a rapper&rsquo;s position is endless. However, as each becomes more and more greedy, it takes away from the profits of the handlers and eventually, this greed must be dealt with in a permanent manner  &mdash;  result: a convenient car accident or overdose.</p>

Earth to Marxists of Colour: there <i>is</i> no amerikan &#8220;right wing.&#8221;  All that&rsquo;s required to be labeled a &#8220;right wing extremist&#8221; these days is to call for fiscal responsibility, support the Second Amendment and object to the nation of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson being turned into a barrio.

		<p>I think that rap music meant to be socially conscious or political, is practically dead.</p>
<p>Why? Well, I&rsquo;d say that when N.W.A came up with was is now know as gangsta rap, they became quickly very successful, and then just about every rap group tried to copy their style.</p>
<p>Thanks to MTV boss Sumner Redstone, we live in an era where gangsta rap has been mainstream ofr quite a few years, now.</p>
<p>Gngsta rap is hateful, vulgar, and stupied, and that is what sells, so it would seem. So we&rsquo;ll still see more and more 50 cents, Ice Cube, Eminem and the like. The days of rap «artists« concerned about other things than «biches», or «hos&rsquo;», or guns, are gone.</p>
<p>Besides, just turn on MTV and have a look at today&rsquo;s rappers. Most look like they have just been released from prison! So what can you expect form people like that?</p>
