<h1>Black Leaders Troubled by Alleged Racist Comments by Asheville Police Officer</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Clarke Morrison, Asheville Citizen-Times, April 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The head of Asheville&rsquo;s NAACP chapter said Wednesday he found no surprise in allegations a city police sergeant sent a racist text message to an officer he supervised.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the climate that is tolerated at the Asheville Police Department,&#8221; said John Hayes, president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p>
<p>The department sees the situation differently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hayes and Bob Smith, director of the Asheville Buncombe Community Relations Council, agreed the allegations indicate police could have more work to do in ensuring racial sensitivity.</p>
<p>The claims of a racist text message are made in a sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit filed by Officer Cherie Byrd against the city and Sgt. Eric Lauffer, who won a 2008 &#8220;officer of the year&#8221; award from the city.</p>
<p>In a November 2008 text message, Lauffer said &#8220;the election is making me sick&#8221; and that &#8220;due to recent events: grape soda, red kool-aid, fried chicken, malt liquor, menthol cigarettes and gold teeth will be tax exempt,&#8221; according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Lauffer also sent her sexually explicit text messages, Byrd said in the lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>In keeping with federal law, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reviewed Byrd&rsquo;s complaint and found she had the right to sue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> The Rev. L.C. Ray, president of the Asheville-based Baptist Ministers Union, urged city leaders to investigate the allegations fully.</p>
<p>&#8220;If (the allegations) are true, naturally that would be unacceptable,&#8221; Ray said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smith said that for years he&rsquo;s conducted meetings of the council&rsquo;s law enforcement community relations committee. Police officials and community leaders have attended the meetings to work on fostering better relationships.</p>
<p>&#8220;For our law enforcement personnel and all of our leadership, we need to have a better understanding of what sensitivity is all about,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;(The alleged comments by Lauffer) just shows there is much work to get done. To make texts like that certainly shows insensitivity to the African-American community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hayes also has been part of meetings over the years intended to create a better relationship between police and blacks in the community.</p>

		<p>Actually, &#8220;grape soda, red kool-aid, fried chicken, malt liquor, menthol cigarettes and gold teeth&#8221; are used and possessed by a number of people of all different races - these are not exclusively &#8220;black&#8221; items.  I love grape soda, red koolaid, and fried chicken - and watermelon, too - and I&rsquo;m white with Cherokee blood.  SO WHAT???  These people need to grow up.  They are making a full-up boil out of a miniscule pimple - and it&rsquo;s time to lance it, regardless of any pain it would cause. </p>

		<p>Asheville has a ghetto now?  It was a nice, relatively minority-free place about ten years ago.  The only downside is that it was full of white leftist hippie/greenie types.</p>

		<p>Asheville leaders troubled by text wow are they also troubled by rapes, burglaries, murders and other real crimes. This a smoke screen to take attention away and make themselves feel like martyrs while real crime just goes on.</p>

		<p>	African Americans need to stir the racial cauldron to prove white supremacists still exist; so when their race baiting fails to produce the desired result they grow increasingly frustrated and resort to falsifying claims bigotry and hate to gain sympathy for their cause; which is to continue the affirmative action policies that provides them with preferential treatment. </p>

		<p>Wonder if during the days of &#8216;slavery&rsquo; blacks supposedly weren&rsquo;t allowed to say this, or that, comment? All we need are little blinders attached to our head like horses have on the road, so we can&rsquo;t see. And a muzzle, too. Then something to prevent text messages. Then again humans can be trained much better, so that stuff might be unnecessary and unsightly. </p>

		<p>So the NAACP is saying that those things are associated with blacks. I could have heard this story and not applied a color to it until it was pointed out to me. Hmmm Maybe I&rsquo;m not a racist.</p>

		<p>This is  how  it often begins with those determined to climb the ladder that much quicker. You claim racial harrasment from your  colleagues, you get an enquiry (or  six), you get a pay out,you get  apologies, and - sometimes -you even get endless promotions.

		<p>Blacks are making fun of themselves when they complain about any reference to fried chicken, etc. as being derogatory.  I, as a hillbilly, have gone to college and worked in places where my ethnic group was a minority, and some people there teased me and made jokes at my expense.  I just laughed with them, even when the references were somewhat insulting.  Otherwise, they would have resented and even shunned me.  Somebody needs to tell blacks that it&rsquo;s time to stop the thin-skinned routine.  Maybe our President could.</p>

		<p>If blacks could make the case for black supremacy they would do so in a heartbeat.  They can&rsquo;t because blacks occupy the bottom rung in the global social ladder. White racial supremacy isn&rsquo;t a matter of opinion; it is a matter of fact and blacks will never get over it&hellip;</p>

		<p>I agree with Dave. Same thing happened to my brother in Mecklenburg County (Charlotte). He gained rank at a younger age than ever attained previously due to his experience in the USMC and his drive to be the best at what he does. A co-&#8220;worker&#8221; accused him of sexual harassment and he was forced out of the department. The woman was treated with kid gloves and shown &#8220;every&#8221; consideration from that point forward. Just brings one question to mind for me&hellip; since the laws are careful to use the term &#8220;minorities&#8221; rather than the racial designations, and we are slated to be the minority by no later than 2050, will we then get the special protections now being afforded to them?</p>

<p>Even if the incident described really happened, and is not another hoax, whiners like this one need to understand that acting like a bunch of thin-skinned crybabies means that the rest of us will continue to not take them seriously in any professional environment.</p>
