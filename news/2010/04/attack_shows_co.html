			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chip Johnson, San Francisco Chronicle, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Oakland, like in many U.S. cities, it&rsquo;s considered foolhardy, or worse, to confront or correct a group of rowdy youngsters, especially if they&rsquo;re African American or Latino.</p>
<p>Tian Sheng Yu, a hard-working 59-year-old Chinese immigrant, did not understand this cardinal rule. He was assaulted after speaking in his native tongue to two African American individuals who had, moments before, punched his 27-year-old son in an unprovoked attack. </p>
<p>Confronting violent individuals can be a risky business. In this case, it may cost Yu his life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not politically correct to talk about how some young African American males might be more likely to commit violent acts, but, in Oakland particularly, it&rsquo;s not a statistically inaccurate portrait either. </p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a failure of black parents to hold their children accountable, but only a collective (societal) failure leads to this kind of savagery,&#8221; said Olis Simmons, executive director of Youth Uprising, a city-funded youth violence prevention program.</p>
<p>The incident began around 3 p.m. Friday when the victim&rsquo;s son, Jin Cheng Yu, was sucker-punched without provocation by one of the individuals on Telegraph Avenue while Yu&rsquo;s father parked the car. When he told his father what had happened, the two men searched for the attacker and his companion and soon found them.</p>
<p>The elder Yu addressed the attacker and his partner in his native Mandarin, his son said. One of them responded with a punch that sent the man backward to the pavement. He suffered a head injury in the fall that has left him on life support. With the father down, the attackers went after the son again. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand some people don&rsquo;t feel safe walking up and directly addressing these children  &mdash;  and in some cases it&rsquo;s their own children,&#8221; Simmons said.</p>
<p>(snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to say publicly that this kind of behavior is unacceptable in the African American community and we owe amends to the Chinese American community,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Shame on us.&#8221; </p>
<p>Simmons is by no means soft on crime and believes the individuals responsible for such a reprehensible act should be severely punished if found guilty of the assault.</p>
<p>But what is obvious, to Simmons, to me and to just about anybody who&rsquo;s followed Oakland news for the last 15 years, is that there is a downward trend of common decency and respect for life.</p>

		<p>From 1960 to 1990 black thugs routinely attacked Whites, mostly the lederly and the Chronicle said nary a word about it.  Even when 87 year old Angelina Ippolito, the grandmother of one of the candidates for mayor was knocked to the ground, broke both hips and was bed ridden for the rest of her life nothing was said.</p>
<p>That attack occurred on Chestnut St in the Marina area a totally White and very safe area.  Safe that is until the federal courts ordered the busing of black thugs into Marina Junior High.  Weekday afternoons became a nightmare in the Marina area as the black thugs ran rampant robbing, beating and raping.</p>
<p>San Francisco is chilly all year round.  Many White women bought a big make up bag and sewed it to the lining of their coats.  The make up bag functioned as a hidden purse.  But older women have been endangered by San Francisco&rsquo;s thugs since WW2 when they were brought from the south for work.</p>
<p>Asians however still vote Democrat, favor affirmative action and consider themselves part of the grand coalition to destroy White America.  At least the Asian spokes critters, activists and politicians do.</p>

<p>Typical!!  So now it&rsquo;s Mr. Yu&rsquo;s fault for speaking to the black thugs.  Surprised it was only 2.  The typical black thug team is 3, with one in the car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in law enforcement.  Any group of 3 black thugs means trouble.  I drove by a 7-11 near home at midnight last year after getting off work.  I saw a car parked in the parking lot, 3 young black men in it.  I momorized the license plate and called it in.  Turned out they had several armed robbery convictions between them.  All had warrants out for assault, robbery, and other crimes.</p>
<p>Always beware of 3 black men under 45.  It is their preferred number for robbery, rape, murdering Whites.  2 may not be able to handle the victim.  4 or more means too many to share the loot.</p>

		<p>While Black on Asian attacks are troubling the fact is that there needs to be more attention given to tand should be addressed, the truth is that more attention should be given to the growing number of White vigilanties who are violently attacking and in a number of cases, murdering Black and Hispanic citizens.</p>

		<p>yes, in agreement with olis simmons that it is society&rsquo;s (collective) fault that allows and breeds this type of savagery.  This type of behavior will steadily decrease if society will impose selective breeding and deportation of two-legged creatures that cannot function and benefit from being in an advanced society.  It is certainly society&rsquo;s fault for not being more restrictive in allowing admittance within its boundaries. </p>

		<p>We are not seeing any downward spiral in morality. What we are seeing is the natural uninhibited behavior of the black community now that they are no longer being constrained by whites. The dramatic difference in the amount of predatory crime and violence found in the black community is just the true reflection of their moral standards as a group.</p>

And if correct (as it certainly is), what&rsquo;s Johnson&rsquo;s solution? Classes in civility? Here is guy who could get run over by a truck and blame Goodyear for making the tires.</p>

		<p>Notice how the parameters of the issue always get broadened to include everyone, as in &#8220;common&#8221; decency, etc. No, it&rsquo;s not everybody, it&rsquo;s certain sub-groups. Just like the hubbub here in Chicago regarding upticks in street shootings. What are &#8220;we&#8221; to do, ask the perpetually anguished commentators. It&rsquo;s not &#8220;we&#8221;, it&rsquo;s what are &#8220;they&#8221; planning on doing about themselves. Very few of the shootings (actually none) involve white perpetrators so there&rsquo;s not much more we can do besides locking them up afterwards.</p>

<p> The &#8220;youths&#8221; have been told their entire life that they have the right to assault; both verbally and physically, anyone, anytime and anywhere that they desire for any reason. They have been reassured continually that their community will support and accept this behavior.<br>
 As long as this continues, they will only become more aggressive until they will have no respect for any life.</p>

		<p>Yeah - and it&rsquo;s going to get worse.  In the first place, when you have male teens raised in single-parent homes, there will be no discipline; the mothers have no control over their sons.  Secondly, in the ghetto, drug use is rampant.  The teens&rsquo; parents generally both are involved in either illegal drugs or in alcoholism - it&rsquo;s the same disease.  It&rsquo;s genetic, so the kids are more than likely going to become addicts/alcoholics as well.  So anyone trying to stop a strong young male under the influence of meth is on a fool&rsquo;s errand; it often takes 6 strong men to subdue ONE strong teen on meth.  All of these factors are contributing towards the downwards spiral of decency; and, with the economic downturn, it&rsquo;s going to get more desperate for the have-nots, and in turn, worse for all the rest of us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;there is a downward trend of common decency and respect for life&#8221;</p>
<p>A cheap shot at all Americans for the barbaric behavior of blacks. Not that I entirely disagree that common decency has also disappeared from among the White populace. Culture has been vulgarized to a great decree. Part of that vulgarization is the result of the endless promotion of &#8216;thug life&rsquo; by the entertainment industry. Low class and ignorant whites have adopted black mannerisms. </p>
<p>Back to the main story: When I was living in Oakland during the late 80s, I once boarded a very crowded city bus. There was one seat still open, but I decided to stand and let a diminutive Asian highschool girl take the open seat. She thanked me and started to sit down, when the fat black woman sitting next to open seat said &#8216;doanchu sit by me!&#8221;. The girl jumped up terrorized and intimidated. At the time I was mystified at the hatred the black woman showed to a 4&rsquo;11&#8221; Asian teenager.  </p>

		<p>This &#8220;downward trend&#8221; is simply the blacks (and mexicans) finding their own natural level once the White Man&rsquo;s unreasonable expectations have been discarded.  White law and order used to keep these people at their best, such as it was.  Now they have thrown off the hated chains of civilization, and are free at last to make their own destiny.  They are not &#8220;African-Americans&#8221;, but American Africans.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Hurt people hurt people, and I guarantee when they find the men who did this, the story of their own lives will curdle your blood,&#8221; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hurt people? Nonsense.  There must be a million black criminals on the streets right now whose only reasons for committing violence is a total lack of discipline, and bad attitudes brought on by being told they can&rsquo;t get ahead because of racism and slavery, instead of their own inability.</p>
<p>The lefties shriek hysterically about talk show commentators inciting conservatives to violence, but never mention that this country has hundreds of black on white assaults every year, because blacks have been told over and over they&rsquo;re victims of one kind or another.  There are 37,500 black on white rapes in any given year, but fewer than ten white on black.  Blacks commit 58% of all violent crime, but they&rsquo;re only 12% of the population.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be denied blacks have a propensity for violence far more than any other race.  US Dept of Justice stats prove this to be true.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always an excuse for their actions.  No matter how heinous black crime gets it&rsquo;s always excused by someone and that &#8220;someone&#8221; is always another black or a left wing crazy.</p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;s too late for that. First of all, &#8220;African American community&#8221; is an oxymoron. Second, the information age has made others all too conscious of the realities of black behavior.</p>
<p>There seems to be only two possibilities whenever blacks live among other races. Either they live in constant mortal fear for their own lives, or they keep others in constant mortal fear for theirs. Whites, Asians, and Latinos have a common enemy, and the times they are a-changin&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The Chronicle originally ran a version of this story on the front page of their Sunday edition. It was a long article. Not once, in the entire article, did they mention the race of the perps. Of course, when the MSM doesn&rsquo;t mention a criminal&rsquo;s race, you know the race. </p>

		<p>Olis Simmons makes $178,000 a year overseeing her &#8220;youth center.&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth center is funded by the City of Oakland and Alameda County. </p>
<p>Much of that money comes from a parcel tax called &#8220;Measure Y&#8221; that was sold to the public as a way to hire more police. </p>
<p>The police never materialized, but funding for Simmons&rsquo; Youth Uprising center has, to the tune of $1.5 million over five years from the city of Oakland alone. </p>
<p>While the center is supported by tax dollars from all citizens, the board of directors of the center appears to be almost exclusively black (there is only one member of the board I could not confirm is black.). </p>
<p>This is in a city that is 30% black and 16% Asian. </p>
<p>How did this group get   &mdash;   and stay   &mdash;   funded? Simmons sits on the board of a non-profit that awarded the head of the Measure Y oversight committee a $56,000 contract. </p>
<p>What does Youth Uprising do? Here&rsquo;s some research from an Oakland-based blog known as OPRN. </p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;You might not care for hyphy, but you are paying for it. The Oakland city council gave Youth UpRising $1.5 million over five years in Measure Y money, the parcel tax that was supposed to get us 802 police but has instead seen the loss of several dozen officers. Meanwhile, so-called violence prevention money in Measure Y goes to Youth UpRising. 
How did the City describe such things as running an employment agency for sideshow-celebrating music videos? &#8220;Youth UpRising offers comprehensive, fully integrated health, wellness, educational, career, arts and cultural programming.&#8221; (Dept. of Human Services report to council, April 25, 2006) Isn&rsquo;t bureaucratic language wonderful? 
<p>Youth UpRising also expects &#8220;$175,000 per year for two years from Oakland Fund for Children and Youth (OFCY)&#8221; for &#8220;a youth to youth grant making program.&#8221; (Same report) More great bureaucratic language: youth making grants to youth, the same game practiced with City money by the notorious agency PUEBLO, whose officers embezzled at least $185,000.&#8221;<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the employees was a Daryell Barker, a 22-year-old dance instructor who was charged in 2008 with sexually molesting an 11-year old girl. </p>
<p>It turns out Barker was, according to a police officer addressing local residents, &#8220;a known drug dealer.&#8221; He has also been charged with illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun. </p>

		<p>There does seem to be a rising trend of blacks victimizing asians.<br>
 Probably it is a statistical artifact due to the fact that asian immigration has grown massively in recent years.No doubt it is also strongly correlated with the fact that on the average asians are a physically small people with under-developed musculature.Blacks, bing the classic bullies and predators that they are, see the physical weakness and ruthlessly capitalize on it.</p>

		<p>The Asian population is increasing dramatically all over the place.  Because they are non-white, when voodoos attack them, it gets a little coverage.  It is strangely satisfying to see Asians complain of crimes committed against them by voodoos, and for them to see that the PC crowd ignores them and does nothing to help them.  </p>
<p>The Asians, quickly adopting the preferred minority status that every other non-white group latches onto, are starting to organize and protest here and there, like they did in Philadelphia about those indidents about 6 months ago when voodoos were attacking Asian students every day.  It is no secret that Asians prefer to live among whites over voodoos and latinos.</p>
<p>For the present, until we get some of our rights back, we can use them as a buffer.  They can openly complain against voodoo crime, we cannot.</p>

		<p>A collective societal failure?  Well, I suppose in one sense it could be called that.  Given that blacks overwhelmingly comprise the criminal class in this country (and everywhere else they&rsquo;re found in significant numbers), failure to deal with them as the criminal element that they are is a form of societal failure. It would reasonable, for example, to completely deny the legal possession of firearms to them, while making it totally available to members of other races.  They&rsquo;re almost totally dependent on other races economically.  Should people so situated be allowed to vote, and thus make legal demands on the rest of us?  Certainly not.  Sounds a bit like apartheid.  Given the many examples of prosperous countries being built under such a system in Africa, then utterly destroyed after whites lost control, it would seem that apartheid is the only system in history that was ever able to deal successfully with blacks.</p>

<p>Maybe this behavior doesn&rsquo;t reflect blacks as a group. Maybe they just put up with these shenanigans somewhat among their own, because it serves as a excuse for doing what they really want, and what they do, victimize other groups. Or maybe it&rsquo;s an unintended byproduct. One they are willing to put up with. When it&rsquo;s open season on one group, in this case whites. It&rsquo;s not long before they see hunting season as open for everyone.</p>

Thank you Robert - you are exactly right!  This comment should be copy/pasted onto EVERY newspaper story bemoaning the downfall of the &#8220;black community&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I used to buy the standard libertarian-conservative position that exploding crime and illegitimacy in blacks since the 1950s was due to welfare politics and liberal interventions.  But now it&rsquo;s obvious to me that it was the end of Jim Crow and segregation that allowed blacks to blossom into their natural state.  The relatively stable black neighborhoods of the prior 80 yrs were maintained by fear of whites cracking down on them for misbehavior.  </p>
<p>Blacks used to police their own communities only because they HAD to.  Once the boot came off their necks, they went wild.  </p>

		<p>How will blacks atone for their sin of failing to avoid robbing, raping, and murdering White Americans who have done more for them than any other race has done for another in the history of Mankind?</p>
<p>The black failure to live up to the opportunities of forced Integration is the most significant story of human history.</p>
<p>White liberal elites keep talking about the need for Whites to do more to atone for the sins of segregation.  </p>
<p>When will they start talking about the need for blacks to atone for the sin of over representing themselves in every category of uncouthness, such as crime and illegitimacy.</p>
<p>Would Newsweek ever do a story on the rate of black unwed mothers having babies for men who abandon them in the normal course of the &#8220;authentic black culture of kep&rsquo;n it real&#8221;?</p>
<p>Or a story on how black crime isn&rsquo;t caused by White Racism?</p>
<blockquote>
whose To Kill a Mockingbirdgave the whites of the Jim Crow South an object lesson in how they might at least begin to atone for the sins of segregation.
<p><br>
Best known as the leader of the NAACP from 1977 to 1992, he is one of a slowly disappearing cadre of civil-rights giants, men and women who, not so long ago, marched and worked to press America to apply the inherent meaning of its founding premise &mdash; that all men are created equal &mdash; to everyone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We should make a point to remember men like Hooks; they were founders of modern America in the way Washington and Adams and Jefferson were Founders of the nation itself. Like the Founders of old, though, Hooks and his colleagues lived real lives, full of trials as well as triumphs. At the NAACP in the years of Carter, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, he found that it had been relatively easier to confront Jim Crow than it was to advance the fight for racial, economic, and social justice into every sphere of American life. The whites-only signs had come down; the barriers to equality of fact as well as equality of law were harder to overcome &mdash; and still are. </p>
<p><br>
Will Newsweek ever do a story on why blacks need the constant help from Whites in America just to survive?  Ever a story on why blacks don&rsquo;t rise up and demand that their slavery reparations start with repatriation back home to Africa where they belong?</p></blockquote>
