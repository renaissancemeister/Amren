<h1>Health Secretary Addresses Minority Health Care Disparities at National Convention in NYC</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan K. Scott, Minneapolis Star Tribune, April 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Wednesday that she is developing a national plan of action that would focus for the first time on reducing health care disparities between minority and white populations.</p>
<p>HHS has been writing reports for 25 years documenting the gap in health care services between white and minority communities, but there never has been an action plan to address the gap, she said in an address to the National Action Network convention.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m here to say that&rsquo;s going to end this year,&#8221; Sebelius said.</p>
<p>She said 1 in 3 U.S. Hispanics and 1 in 5 African-Americans do not have health insurance, adding that the National Institutes of Health also is looking into the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prominent leaders in civil rights, religion, politics and education are scheduled to discuss issues affecting communities of color. Besides health care, topics include the black achievement gap and the state of the black church.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;.a national plan of action that would focus for the first time on reducing health care disparities between minority and white populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Step 1: The &#8220;plan of action&#8221; will need to raise the IQ level of both the Hispanic and Black populations so that they are knowledgeable about what health care is.  However, raising someone&rsquo;s IQ is akin to changing the stripes on a zebra.  Results are not encouraging.</p>
<p>Step 2: The &#8220;plan of action&#8221; will also need to find a way to raise Hispanic and Black employment and earning potential so they can actually afford health insurance that whites have.  Employment and earning potential are both linked to a person&rsquo;s IQ level.</p>
<p>Because a persons IQ level is linked to race, the &#8220;plan of action&#8221; will ultimately require racial discrimination against whites to achieve the government&rsquo;s goal in &#8220;closing the gap&#8221;.  And the Government knows this.</p>
<p>So, the Government&rsquo;s final &#8220;plan of action&#8221; will be to rob, steal and plunder the white population and give the proceeds to the non whites.  And that is exactly what the racist thieves in Washington DC are doing and are planning to do on a much larger scale.</p>

		<p>Obamacare is basically a scheme to get free healthcare to blacks and others slackers who were on the margins of the system because they couldn&rsquo;t pay for health unlimited health services. While many did get care through ERs and &#8220;free clinics&#8221; they didn&rsquo;t overwhelm the system because the gatekeeper was money and blacks never spend money on their general health because it involves contemplating the future.</p>
<p>When Obama talks about the &#8220;uninsured&#8221; he really means unemployed blacks and their myriad problems while using the lower percentage of uninsured whites as cover.</p>
<p>When blacks get a free ride on the health care merry-go-round the system will implode. I think many &#8220;experts&#8221; think that this will lead to greater prevention of disease - it will not. Low IQs and a fractured family structures will have blacks headed to the doctor for every conceivable ache or pain. They will not follow medical directions, they will not properly take their medication because they will often not understand the disease process in the first place, they will sell their painkillers on the street, and then they will sue because they were &#8220;wronged by the man.&#8221; </p>
<p>Opening up a health care buffet to the previously uninsured who have no conception of work or money will also lead to thousands of disability claims now thay they have access to doctors, demands for work excuses because &#8220;I be sick,&#8221; and more and more tax money centered on the &#8220;special needs of minorities.&#8221; Useless attempts at drug abuse treatment and mental health services alone for this population will be staggering.</p>
<p>This is a disgrace - it only encourages negative behavior in this population because &#8220;the doctor be treatin&rsquo; my problems if I gets sick again.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ultimately, when the money runs out, the medical system will be dumbed down to the lowest common denominator and everyone will get minimal care. Only if you have money to go outside the system (which may be made illegal - just watch) can you expect competent treatment.</p>

<p>The healthcare bill is filled with programs and mandates that are strictly for the benefit of elevating blacks, because they just can&rsquo;t get ahead on their own.  </p>
<p>In fact the entire agenda of this pro-black president concerns the elevation of blacks via some kind of unfair manipulation that will enable them to achieve or acquire things they aren&rsquo;t able to on their own.  That&rsquo;s why the pro-black community organizer wanted to be president.  It has nothing at all to do with advancing the country as a whole.</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>

		<p>Remember when Obama was saying that the new health care bill would not give benefits to the millions of illegal aliens, and the congressman (I forget his name) called out, &#8220;You Lie!&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, now all the illegals will be amnestied (in a year or so) and guess what, those 25 million illegals will now be &#8216;citizens&rsquo; and eligible for what? - free health care!</p>
<p>Obama did not lie so much as pull a masterful trick that is about to come to fruition.</p>

		<p>There are two big assumptions. One is that everyone is genetically equal so all conditions and diseases should be spread evenly between groups. we know this isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>The other big assumption is that given access to &#8216;free&rsquo; healthcare, blacks are going to now practice preventive care by going to doctors on a regular basis and following doctors advice. We know this too is not true.</p>
<p>I see a great deal of money being spent on closing these gaps but just like the education gap, money is not the issue.<br>
