<h1>Poll: Black Teens More Optimistic Than Peers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martha Irvine, Yahoo! News, April 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A poll released Thursday by Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., found that 70 percent of black students ages 15 to 18 thought their standard of living would be better than their parents, compared with just 36 percent of white students.</p>
<p>Overall, 39 percent of respondents thought they would have a higher living standard.</p>
<p>Those numbers and the level of optimism among black students appeared to be closely tied to their enthusiasm for President Barack Obama, making for what some called the &#8220;Obama effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the president&rsquo;s performance, more than two-thirds of black students rated his performance as &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;very good,&#8221; compared with 23 percent of white students. Overall, about a quarter of the students who were surveyed rated the president highly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Young African Americans have this serious afterglow that is not as strong with whites and Hispanics,&#8221; Della Volpe [John Della Volpe, polling director of Harvard Institute of Politics] said. &#8220;And that&rsquo;s despite (African American youth) having more serious economic concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stephen Wu, the Hamilton economist who oversaw the poll, said he was surprised by the stark difference in optimism among races and that black students&rsquo; attitudes appeared to be so tied to their view of the president.</p>
<p>But many students  &mdash;  even in Chicago, the Obama family&rsquo;s home outside Washington  &mdash;  said they witness the divide all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It always comes back to Obama,&#8221; said Deja Bailey, a 15-year-old African American student who attends the city&rsquo;s prestigious Walter Payton High School. Even her own friends can&rsquo;t agree. She said one of them carries a scrapbook about the president and frequently argues with others who say he&rsquo;s doing a &#8220;horrible&#8221; job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But others, such as Harry Tsang, a 19-year-old college freshman in Orlando, Fla., said they&rsquo;re done being patient. Worried about the deficit and government involvement in matters such as health care, the former Obama supporter has started volunteering for Florida Republican Marco Rubio, who&rsquo;s running for the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Tsang, a native of Hong Kong, acknowledges that he was once drawn to the president&rsquo;s charisma and his message of change.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was more about him than the issues. It turns out, it&rsquo;s not the way I think,&#8221; said Tsang, who also joined the Florida Federation of Teenage Republicans, which has seen its membership double to 800 students since Obama was elected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Harvard Institute of Politics survey released last month found that among 18- to 29-year-olds surveyed, a third of whites and just 18 percent of Hispanics planned to vote in the midterm election.</p>
<p>That compares with 41 percent of African Americans who said the same.</p>

		<p>It might be due in part to Obama, but I think it has more to do with the fact that young blacks already have higher self-esteems than young whites or Hispanics or Asians, notwithstanding the self-esteem message imparted in public education.  The reason blacks have a higher self esteem on average is because they have lower intelligence on average.  Easy to feel good about yourself when you don&rsquo;t know any better.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone bothered to ask blacks WHY they felt &#8220;optimistic&#8221;?  The answers would all be variations of an expectation that wealth would be taken away from whites and given to blacks with no work or merit of any kind involved.</p>

- - Black students feel that way because they&rsquo;ve got their &#8220;man&#8221; in the White House.  White students SHOULD feel negative about the future.  It&rsquo;s a beginning sign that they are awakening, albeit very slowly.</p>

		<p>Blacks and other non-whites know that this nation is slowly but surely being created for them. They know that white numbers are declining. They know that the government is ultimately on their side. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that so many whites are angry and pessimistic. Maybe now they&rsquo;ll realize that we were right all along. </p>
<p>Maybe now they&rsquo;ll realize that although most people who have power are white, the overwhelming majority of whites are powerless. They&rsquo;ll also realize that whites with power don&rsquo;t use that power to help their fellow whites. </p>
<p>We can only hope.<br>

		<p>Generally speaking, as a group we Whites are too ashamed and/or confused to rally together and positively indentify ourselves as a group, let alone embarking on the next necessary step of defending ourselves and our way of life.<br>
<i>Divided we fall</i>, but I still choose to live in hope. </p>
<p>On White kids self esteem, when they pandered to as a group?<br>
Almost everything we get to hear about ourselves as the paradoxically non existent group is either on celebrating our decline or questioning the few areas in society where we&rsquo;re still hanging onto power, questioning on how can we rectify this?  <br>
I myself am actually against institutional or &#8216;one on one&rsquo; discrimination, but think about what racial group is the victim of deliberate, legislated (legal) racism these days?<br>
To &#8216;balance the scales&rsquo;, what group needs to be &#8216;positively&rsquo; discriminated against?<br>
And as the entertainment/media machine shows us as in the case of the labour voter in the UK the other day, if we just ask about simple as immigration, we&rsquo;re deemed to be bigots.</p>
<p>Or how many <b>hate</b> crimes are reported with non White&rsquo;s as the victim, with the non White perpetrator&rsquo;s race is omitted so we&rsquo;re presented being as guilty even when we&rsquo;ve actually done nothing (heaven forbid if they find an actual White perpetrator).<br>
  <br>
Or such as the ongoing saga of Tiger Woods, we&rsquo;re just waiting for him to be officially crowned the no.1 black man dominating the traditional White sport again, and all the dramatic bumps on the road are just the glitches, whilst we wait for him to for fill his scripted destiny, and when/if that happens it will be shown as all the stars are moving back in alignment again.<br>
Listen to the radio, watch the television news, get your news online, read a magazine or newspaper it&rsquo;s the same message everywhere (present company excluded) that only Whites hate and that non Whites are the righteous victims.</p>
<p>Culturally all power is flowing away from us, White folks have to find their own self esteem and even then it&rsquo;s virtually a criminal act.<br>

		<p>Try reading a current year High School history book and you will see why the White kids would be less than optimistic about their future.  Their cultural past has been distorted by highlighting every negative and diminishing every positive aspect of their ethnic history.  Everything they read and study brings about the idea that they are all guilty for the faults of their forefathers and that nothing positive has ever come from the White world.  The fact that many from the entire non-White world literally lie, cheat, steal, and sometimes die in efforts to get into the White world is presented more as the result of evil policy by the White man than as the result of White people developing the most desired society ever known to humanity.  On a side note, my children suffer re-history lessons at the dinner table on an almost nightly basis, but as a result they are confident in who they are and look forward to the future, even if that future is lived in a truncated America.</p>

		<p>I read this story in yesterday&rsquo;s Daily Press.  Of course blacks more otimistic than Whites.  Good grief!  That is about as predictable as the sun coming up the next day.  From a high level perspective, our groups have the same agenda.  That is to constantly make things better for ourselves and families.  It is the means by which we obtain our goals that make us different as well as polarize us.</p>
<p>The average White will tend to work harder and play by the rules to reap the benefits of his (or her) labor for a better life.  The avervage black will tend to look for the shortcut or handout to also get a better life.  All available resources are the result of the overall contribution from both blacks and Whites.  In other words, the tax payers.  Given this setup, when resources are redistributed, those that DO NOT pay into the system have a net positive gain and those DO pay into the sytem have a net positive loss.  In other words, White Loss = Black Gain.  Over simplified?  Yes, but true nevertheless.</p>
<p>This configuration might loosely explain why Whites in general are not very optimistic and blacks, as a whole, consider it party time.  However, all this is short term and only an illusion.  In the long term, we are ALL facing a train wreck and only the self aware Whites realize this.  The blacks?  Well, ignorance is indeed bliss.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s on fire and I fear that today&rsquo;s illegal immigrant will be, at some point in the future, deciding if I or a family member get the rationed life saving surgery.</p>

		<p>When blacks have been told their entire lives that all their problems are due to &#8220;the man,&#8221; rather than due to their own lack of capabilities or effort, of course they&rsquo;re going to see a black president as their savior and as one who will &#8220;stick it to the man.&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure that when Mugabe came in as head of Zimbabwe he was seen as the &#8220;great savior&#8221; as well. Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s shine is also fading. I predict that the bloom will fall off of Obama more precipitously in the eyes of young people, and especially blacks, than any other president in recent history. As soon as it becomes apparent that he&rsquo;s not going to pass reparations or any other blatantly anti-white measure, then their eyes will be on the &#8220;next big thing,&#8221; that is, another black leader.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s because of affirmative action, the media and the schools.  Affirmative action assures free very high-paying jobs to any black who shows up.  The media makes blacks to be super heroes and there are plenty of stupid white women who believe whatever they&rsquo;re exposed to.   Schools also paint the black man as a superhero and omit their true statistics. (See the FBI crime stats)</p>

		<p>Well, you get more of what you pay for, and in public schools, we pay for self esteem boosting for minorities, who are shielded from the news of their inherent shortcomings. (Whites certainly are not   &mdash;   they encouraged to be &#8220;realistic&#8221; about their futures.) Even black kids with an 80 IQ are routinely told they can become doctors and lawyers. I knew one guidance counselor who asked for a transfer out of a minority district because she couldn&rsquo;t bear lying anymore to students about their actual prospects after graduation. Even things like affirmative action and quotas are only for kids who are at least intellectually normal, which tragically is only about 15% of the African American population according to Herrnstein and Murray.</p>

		<p>This phenomenon has been observed for years by teachers, social workers, and others who have spent time with black youths.  They&rsquo;ll talk grandly of becoming a doctor, lawyer, or some other professional, but with no hint of the commitment in time and study required to achieve such goals.  As with so many statements of black aspirations, these are most often just daydreams, which usually just wither into a corrosive bitterness when life&rsquo;s realities intrude.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure blacks in Zimbabwe expressed similar optimism when Mugabe took over.  This type of poll simply gauges peoples feelings and has nothing to do with reality,  America is becoming just another Latin American pool.  Black prosperity largely depends on white handouts (visit any city Post Office to see what I mean) and when the third-worlding of America reduces us to South American poverty those handouts are going to cease and blacks will once more be reduced to shifting for themselves with the inevitable results.  </p>
<p>Here is a terrific piece from <i>Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like</i> on this poll:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2bvn6xn" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2bvn6xn</a></p>
<p><i>The Obama Effect causes Black hearts to beat faster with pride, consequently causing those hearts who can see to beat faster as well, but for opposite reasons. The people sense the fate of South Africa and Zimbabwe is what awaits a white minority in 2042 and the precursor to this moment – Mein Obama – offers a telling glimpse into how Democracy will play out for the beleaguered and hated majority now once they are granted permanent minority status&hellip; The Obama Effect is thus defined as creating cohesion and positivity among the Black community, who rally to the only flag that truly matters in life – race – while white people slowly resign themselves to protesting abstractions such as health care and other Tea Party ideas of government, losing all faith in the future.</i></p>

Exactly.  Blacks are usually blissfully ignorant about reality.  Combine that with their native high self-esteem [big egos] and lack of logic, and you get stories like these.</p>

		<p>From a high level perspective, our groups have the same agenda. That is to constantly make things better for ourselves and families.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Is that really true?  How many blacks with AA 6 figure incomes have secured a future for their children?  How many multimillionaire blacks in sports are still wealthy a couple of years after their careers end?  What&rsquo;s that you say?  Almost none?</p>
<p>This strikes right to the heart of the issue.  Blacks, unlike whites, do NOT have the same high level agenda of making things better for themselves&hellip;..not as a race, not as families, not even as individuals.  At least you see zero behaviors that match that agenda.</p>
<p>To see this in broad scope simply look at any black nation, especially black nations formed by looting formerly white controlled societies (zimbabwe, south africa).  Zero ability to act as a cogent group.  Zero ability (or interest) in planning for the future.  Zimbabwe blacks literally choose to starve to death rather than go into their backyards and pan the gold that lies around most of zimbabwe.  In a country desperate for hard currency, any poor person could become instantly rich with only the barest modicum of effort&hellip;&hellip;yet they do not.</p>
<p>Blacks only have what they have because of direct handouts from whites&hellip;.and they only have it for exactly the amount of time those handouts continute.  You could give the average detroit black 5 million dollars in cash.  If he is even still alive 5 years later, he&rsquo;ll be broke and living in the gutter.  None of his children or any of their mothers will see a single dime of that money.</p>
<p>This is the most important issue of all, I think for whites to understand.  That blacks are not the problem.  They are not our competitors.  They cannot compete on our level at all.  They only exist because of what we give them.  As they are a threat to us, it is only to the degree we give to them, both in our own countries and all over the world.  Solving this problem is as simple as to stop what we are doing.</p>
<p>This extends to most non-whites to one degree or another.  Were white nations to pull inward, refuse all contact with non-white nations, those [non-white] nations would collapse in short order and their populations drop VERY quickly (ie they would die off).</p>
<p>There are no racial problems that aren&rsquo;t caused by ourselves.  There are no racial problems that couldn&rsquo;t be easily solved if the truth were to become widespread.  The problem is an always has been the white ability to create civilization with the altruistic desire to share it with non-whites.  Hundreds of years of failure should be enough to know that isn&rsquo;t realistic.  But, we have driven this desire to such an extreme that it now threatens our very existence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not them.  It&rsquo;s us.</p>

		<p>Most everything said here is true, and has been said a gazillion times, and still the problem remains. However, none are willing to pin the bell on the cat. The hyphenated Americans  have learned to vote Democrat since it is far more lucrative than working, and of course much easier. The main problem is many whites have also learned this, and to boot many brain washed whites who have no logical reason to vote Dem do so also. Then of course since the government has grown to vote controlling proportions, and is able to force foreign dissidents on us to further their voting power, we no longer have a republic, rather a democracy that the founders warned us of, which equals mob rule. When a fascist government becomes all powerful, there are only a couple of ways to stop them. Thus the fable, of pin the bell on the cat comes into play. Do you give up yet??</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m 58 and I seem to remember from my youth that blacks always seemed to think pretty highly of themselves, in spite of all the alleged oppression.  They already knew how to corner white girls and hit on them with lines like, &#8220;Are you prejudiced against me?&#8221;  Although not in such good English.  Just like Casius Clay yelling, &#8220;I am the Greatest!&#8221; Blacks in the &rsquo;60s were quite conceited and opinionated, in the most ignorant ways.  Today, its pumped up by powers of ten.</p>

		<p>Correction, white males are pessimistic.  Who wouldn&rsquo;t be facing ethnic cleansing by their own female kin?</p>

		<p>What percent of black male athletes think they are going to make the NBA or NFL?</p>
<p>Do you ever see the grossly overweight black women dancing and they honestly think they look attractive.</p>
<p>I bet black teens are optimistic.</p>
