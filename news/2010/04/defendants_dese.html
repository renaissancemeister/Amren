			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David G. Savage, Los Angeles Times, March 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Supreme Court confronted in two cases Wednesday the stiff federal law that requires deporting noncitizens if they are convicted of an &#8220;aggravated felony,&#8221; even those who have lived here legally for decades.</p>
<p>By a 7-2 vote, they blocked the deportation of a Vietnam veteran from Kentucky who had pleaded guilty to trafficking marijuana because his lawyer told him erroneously he &#8220;did not have to worry about his immigration status&#8221; because he had lived legally in the United States for 40 years.</p>
<p>And the justices heard arguments on whether a Texas man could be deported to Mexico for possessing one tablet of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax after he pleaded guilty the year before to having less than two ounces of marijuana. Both offenses were misdemeanors.</p>
<p>In the Kentucky case, the justices stopped the deportation of Jose Padilla, a native of Honduras, ruling that he deserved a new hearing and possibly a new trial because of the faulty legal advice. The Constitution ensures &#8220;that no criminal defendant  &mdash;  whether a citizen or not  &mdash;  is left to the mercies of incompetent counsel,&#8221; Justice John Paul Stevens said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The drastic measure of deportation or removal is now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes&#8221; that can be an aggravated felony, Stevens said. For that reason, a lawyer &#8220;must inform&#8221; his or her client about the risk of deportation before entering a guilty plea, he said.</p>
<p>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented, saying the Constitution does not require criminal lawyers to give advice on immigration matters.</p>
<p>Padilla&rsquo;s case will now return to Kentucky for trial on the marijuana charges. If he is convicted, he will be deported, his lawyer said.</p>

		<p>I concur with Scalia and Thomas. The Supreme Court itself has ruled that deportation is a civil penalty that does not constitute criminal jeopardy in and of itself. </p>
<p>Are these same prevailing Justices prepared to rule that criminal defense attorneys (who in most cases aren&rsquo;t tax attorneys anyway) must give pre-plea advisals to their clients regarding any potential civil tax matters that might arise from public records of a criminal proceeding?? Imagine a Public Defender Office or court appointed roster criminal defense lawyer giving State Departments of Revenue and IRS civil legal advice to every defendant who was accused having engaged in crimes for profit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a by and large law abiding native born US citizen can find himself accused of being afoul of the law and without privelege of court appointed counsel in a State or Federal civil tax matter that puts his residential house in jeopardy that was red flagged by some Punjabi in Bangalore who will never have to testify on a witness stand in this country.</p>
