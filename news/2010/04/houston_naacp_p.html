<h1>Houston NAACP President Addresses Council Over WRPD Racial Makeup</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marlon A. Walker, Sun News (Macon, Georgia), April 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The racial makeup of the city&rsquo;s departments should mirror the community they serve, the head of the local [Warner Robins] chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People told City Council during Monday&rsquo;s precouncil session.</p>
<p>Larry Holmes, president of the Houston County NAACP, said he was at the meeting to address issues of discrimination at the Warner Robins Police Department, including hiring disparities. He pointed to a case where a judge ruled locally against the Houston County Board of Education, saying the teacher makeup should mirror that of the students they oversee.</p>
<p>The same should go for Warner Robins city departments, Holmes said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holmes said research done recently showed several other local law enforcement agencies have respectable numbers with respect to their racial makeups. At the Macon Police Department, about 39 percent of the staff is black. At the Bibb County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, 53 percent of the staff is black. At the Houston County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, 32 percent of the staff there is black.</p>
<p>According to recent figures, 5 percent of the current staff at the Warner Robins Police Department is black, Holmes said. During the 2000 census, Warner Robins&rsquo; population was 32.1 percent black.</p>

Why is it that whites can&rsquo;t use the same argument when they&rsquo;re the majority? When whites are the majority, the argument is that the group needs to be diverse and inclusive.</p>
<p>An historically white community must be destroyed while a historically black community must be preserved.</p>

		<p>Black civil rights groups are always complaining that the racial makeup of a city&rsquo;s PD should closely mirror the racial makeup of its population.  </p>
<p>First off, that is an impossible feat to accomplish, because only certain people above a certain age (usually non-felons with none or almost no conviction or arrest record besides, over 21, and with no shady life associations) can be cops, and since more blacks are either younger, felons or hang out with hoods, that disqualifies (or should disqualify them, in spite of some actions of the Federal judiciary) them from being cops, which means the WRPD can never (or should never) be 32.1% black. </p>
<p><br>
Second, why only worry about the racial makeup of the population?  Why not consider the racial makeup of the tax dollars in Warner Robins?  I&rsquo;m sure that, when paying versus receiving is considered, that white people are paying almost every penny of taxes.  (The reason blacks might be paying some is that Warner Robins is presumably a city, and since most cities have no welfare benefits, and only collect sales taxes and other types of taxes, blacks might contribute some, but still way lower than their numbers.) </p>
<p>Third, why not apply this logic to the NAACP?  Why shouldn&rsquo;t its board of directors mirror the racial demographics of its membership or contributors?  If the latter, than the NAACP&rsquo;s leaders would be almost all white.</p>

		<p>I want quotas, too.  Look at Detroit, Chicago, and Altanta.  Too many blacks in government jobs there.  They need to hire, oh, four whites for every ten blacks they have.  I mean, if quotas are okay for black, then they&rsquo;re okay for whites.  right?</p>

		<p>Whites should help them get what they want by fleeing any jurisdiction where blacks are more than 10% and Whites pay taxes.</p>
<p>Let the blacks get what they want, but only under the condition that they stay put.<br>

Blacks in Athens Batter and Terrorize White Sewanee Alumnus and Wife in Racially Motivated Attack</p>
<p>Sexually Threaten Wife</p>
<p>Hutson Vann, a White Sewanee football alumnus, encountered the Diversities in Athens, Ga., and received the Real Diversity Treatment.</p>
<p>Four African American football players ganged up against a sole White Sewanee alum and his wife. Thug life can&rsquo;t resist an easy White target. What were the african Diversity&rsquo;s plans for the White Mrs. Vann?</p>
<p>Had the Vann household not shown enough commitment to &ldquo;Celebrate Diversity&rdquo; and were therefore just getting the Social Justice they deserved?</p>
<p>When will Sewanee&rsquo;s Diversity Coalition hold the Unity March in support of the terrorized White Sewanee alum and his wife? </p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/apr/05/athens-police-say-only-uga-football-player-taxi-ac/?breakingnews" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/apr/05/athens-police-say-only-uga-football-player-taxi-ac/?breakingnews</a>
<p>Huston Vann, a former Sewanee linebacker from Fannin County High School, and his wife, Meghan, filed an incident report last week on charges of simple battery and terroristic threats or acts after allegedly being harassed in the van on Sunday, March 28, around 2 a.m. In the incident report&rsquo;s narrative, Vann cited four black males, &ldquo;all of whom were UGA football players.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>http://www.redandblack.com/2010/04/05/acc-police-offenders-in-taxi-cab-attack-not-uga-football-players/
<p>Investigation into the report of Simple Battery and Terroristic Threats filed by HUTSON and MEGHAN VANN of an incident which occurred in a taxi on March 28 has determined the offenders are NOT University of Georgia football players. However, one football player was in the taxi, but the investigation revealed he acted as a peace maker and tried to calm the situation. The other males have been identified as residents of Heard County and warrants are pending. Additional information will be released when the warrants are issued.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Sewanee teach Hutson Vann that Athens is a dangerous place for current and former White Sewanee football players? Didn&rsquo;t he learn about the black-on-White murder by Diversity of White Sewanee student athlete Philip Cole in Athens? Why wasn&rsquo;t that social engagement lesson part of first day training in the Sewanee football program? Isn&rsquo;t White Sewanee complicit in Hutson Vann&rsquo;s endangerment, pain and suffering for not teaching him how to keep on guard against the non white Diversities while in Athens?</p>
<p>Why do the Diversities obsess over fornication with their vicitms?</p>
<blockquote>http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/040510/bre_602353825.shtml
<p>One of the men slapped the husband in the back of the head, and warned him to turn around &ldquo;if he wanted to live,&rdquo; according to police.</p>
<p>The woman told the men to stop hitting her husband, and one of the men struck her in the head, police said.</p>
<p>The couple told police that the men made inappropriate sexual remarks to the wife before the taxi dropped them off at their home an hour after they got in the cab, police said. </p></blockquote>

		<p>Perhaps what we need is a quota for crime.  Black people can only commit crimes in proportion to their percentage of the population.  Anything more that that should be considered racist.  We could say the same thing for taxpayers.  Maybe that will get them to join tea parties.</p>

		<p>Black citizens will seldom contribute to law and order, remember their mantra is &#8220;no snitch&#8221;, as they proudly live in a lawless jungle.  They are too ignorant to understand a society based on laws and order, witness their witless clamouring for everything for nothing.  Especially education, work, bettering themselves.</p>
<p>Much less obeying decency laws, and maintaining civilization.</p>
<p>We deserve a nation of our own apart from &#8220;their&#8221; influence.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, I just made the same points in a letter to the editor around here in the local rag, Asbury Park Press. I called for quotas so that &#8220;diversity&#8221; could be achieved on the Asbury Park Fire Dept.(my letter was in response to an article in the paper saying that it was a problem that the fire dept. wasn&rsquo;t as diverse as it should be). I don&rsquo;t know why they didn&rsquo;t print it. Possibly because they don&rsquo;t like being ridiculed.</p>

		<p>Th3 ongoing demise of South Africa has one major problem that is very racialistic and that is the black govt. passing laws that insist that all institutions, private and public must practice affirmative action with the expected results.  Many highly qualified whites have been fired to make way for barely qualified blacks many just out of university.</p>

		<p>See the article above &#8220;Houston NAACP president addresses council over WRPD racial makeup&#8221; where the NAACP argues the premise that one race can&rsquo;t represent another. The demographics of the Republican Party show that Michael Steele can&rsquo;t represent the overwhemingly White Republican Party. </p>

		<p>Bartle Bull is permitted to criticize this flagrant demonstration of anti-White racism publicly. Any non-liberal White who had raised such a stink would be demonized as a Hater, a Bigot, and, of course, a Racist.</p>
<p>Not sure if that is entirely true. As Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza documented in his work &#8216;illiberal education&rsquo;, academia is littered with the carriers of once reputable &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; activists in good standing who have strayed too far from the liberal plantation. You&rsquo;re &#8216;credentials&rsquo; may indeed have something to do with whether it goes to being fired, or just silence. Tammy Bruce is another that I can think of. According to once source, in under one year over 50 separate people in North California alone were fired for being &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t have a documentation for that but at least someone was paying attention.</p>

		<p>Since race is just a social construct, why worry so much about it?  City councils should indeed reflect the populations they serve, so every year a new city council should be appointed which represents the city it serves, adjusted to demographic changes. First off, you&rsquo;ll need a council member to reflect the many 18-25 year olds in his/her constituency, and one to reflect the seniors.  Also, people with AIDS, felony convictions, people with handicaps, learning disabilities, the illiterate, people who speak no english, homosexuals, single mothers, muslims, and so on, should all be reflected in city coucil.  It&rsquo;s only fair.</p>
