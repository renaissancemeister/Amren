			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, MSNBC, April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five states  &mdash;  New York, California, Texas, Arizona and Florida  &mdash;  are perilously close to losing out on congressional seats because of lackluster participation in the U.S. census.</p>
<p>The five were average or below average in mailing back 10-question census forms when compared to other states, trailing by as many as 5 percentage points, according to the final census mail-in tally released Wednesday.</p>
<p>Based on recent population trends, New York, California and Texas had been estimated to fall just above the cutoff for the last House seats when they are redistributed next year. Waiting behind them in hopes of picking up additional seats are Arizona and Florida, which are already expected to gain one seat apiece.</p>
<p>Responses from these states also raise a red flag because of their higher shares of residents who are Latinos. The Census Bureau has said one of its main concerns is whether tensions over immigration will discourage Latinos, and particularly illegal immigrants, from participating in the government count. That issue returned to the forefront after Arizona passed a tough immigration enforcement bill.</p>
<p>Latino residents represent a predominant share of the population growth in New York, California, Texas, Arizona and Florida, making up more than 50 percent of total growth since 2000. As a result, those states could face big losses if there isn&rsquo;t full cooperation when the Census Bureau on Saturday begins knocking on the doors of those who did not respond by mail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Incredibly disappointed&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, said he was concerned about some skittish Latinos who may refuse to answer their doors, particularly given Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m incredibly disappointed with the Obama administration in their efforts to promote the census,&#8221; Vargas said, citing the government&rsquo;s failure to halt immigration raids during the count as it did in 2000. &#8220;It may have the impact of shooting people in the foot if Arizona ends up losing out on a House seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;The census is not over&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>On Wednesday, Census Bureau director Robert Groves attributed the strong mail participation rate of 72 percent to the bureau&rsquo;s advertising and outreach campaign, which helped overcome growing public apathy toward surveys as well as distrust of the government. But he said it remained uncertain how that will translate to &#8220;how the American public reacts when we knock on their door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The census is not over,&#8221; said Groves, who noted the non-respondents were disproportionately low-income, lesser-educated or renters. &#8220;For those of you who haven&rsquo;t been counted in the 2010 census, this is your moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At training sessions this week, temporary census workers were instructed on the protocols of conducting interviews, such as how to tabulate answers on race (let people self-identify if they&rsquo;re multiracial, but a label of &#8220;American&#8221; isn&rsquo;t a sufficient response), where to ask questions (outside, since census workers should not ask to enter a person&rsquo;s home) and carrying proper identification (government badges and a &#8220;U.S. Census Bureau&#8221; bag).</p>

		<p>Excuse me, but illegal immigrants should NOT BE COUNTED in the census in the first place.  What this article is admitting is that seats (therefore representation) in Congress would be determined by people who are not citizens and don&rsquo;t belong here, and have no right to vote.  Period.  But the article whines because illegals aren&rsquo;t filling out the census forms?  I call that TREASON and aiding and abetting treason in wishing they would.</p>

		<p>So the big home foreclosure states are also the worst Census participants are also the most populated by illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Only a politician could fail to see the problem here.</p>

		<p>The census counts all those living in the US, legal or not.  And you are  right, it means that counted illegal immigrants get representation in Congress. who in turn vote for the illegals interests.    </p>

The census has become a shameless grab for federal money.</p>
<p>Illegals aren&rsquo;t citizens and they shouldn&rsquo;t be counted. We&rsquo;re TOLD repeatedly that they don&rsquo;t get welfare so why should they be counted and money be given to the states based on non-citizens? States shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to us illegals to swell their population for the sake of getting more money.</p>
<p>This is shameless and it should be criminal.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from New York and I&rsquo;ll be delighted if New York loses a seat or two in the House of Representatives due to illegal aliens continuing to &#8220;hide in the shadows&#8221; (if only they would).  Our politicians stink, and we should not be inflicting their views on the rest of the country.  A Ron Paul Republican wouldn&rsquo;t have a chance here.  The same goes for California.</p>
<p>When illegal aliens are counted in the census they effectively get representation in Congress, and that should not happen.<br>

		<p> Allowing foreigners to determine representation is high treason.<br>
 Foreigners lobbying in our capital for representation is an act of war.<br>
 Pandering to these foreigners is an obamanation.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve suspected for quite some time that our hostile ruling elites are studying the answers to those nosy census questions about &#8216;race&rsquo; to determine where whites are fleeing to, in order to get away from minority crime, welfare parasitism, and the general social decay that goes along with living in areas that have high concentrations of non-whites.  Then, compiling these statistics, whenever these hostile, anti-white, white-race hating ruling elites decide to bring in another boat load of African Bantu Somalis, or African Burundis, or Iraqis, or any other group of non-white &#8216;refugees&rsquo; from the endless number of third world places on the planet - the consult those demographic statistics and use them to decide where to resettle those non-whites.   </p>
<p>In short, these hostile elites do not want to leave any area of America left for whites to flee to, in order to live among their own people in peace and harmony.   </p>
<p>Is that not the most evil sort of vile and despicable hatred imaginable?   </p>

		<p>I sent back my census form without filling out the racial data, and included a note asking why these divisions were even in a census form - which is supposed to be about numbers ONLY.  I also asked why certain groups are being singled out for special treatment.  Waiting for the knock on the door. </p>
<p>By the way, I find more and more (white) people of intelligence and perspicacity are catching on, and questioning the intent to divide by classification.<br>

<p>That attitude just screams for a response. Where in the US constitution is this a Federal mandate?  </p>
