			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mara Gay, AOL News, April 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tim James is betting his election that Alabama voters prefer what he calls &#8220;common sense&#8221; to &#8220;political correctness.&#8221; The Republican gubernatorial candidate is running a provocative ad arguing that Alabama&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license exam should be given only in English.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Alabama; we speak English,&#8221; James says. &#8220;If you want to live here, learn it.&#8221; The campaign spot has had more than 60,000 views on YouTube.</p>
<p>The son of former Alabama Gov. Fob James promises to do away with the 12 foreign languages the test currently offers if he is elected in November. In the ad, James suggests his goal is to save taxpayers money. {snip}</p>
<p>In the blogosphere, though, many say the controversial ad is about far more than saving taxpayers money and contains coded political messages James hopes will strike a chord with Republican voters in the state.</p>
<p>The Atlantic&rsquo;s Marc Ambinder said it contains swipes against the federal government and President Barack Obama. Ambinder also noted that Alabama could lose federal funding if it offers the exams only in English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some say it is no mistake that the ad comes in the middle of an emotional debate over immigration reform.</p>
<p>The Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama said the ad would hurt the state&rsquo;s reputation. {snip}</p>
<p>Ambinder said the &#8220;ethnic coding in the ad is unmistakable,&#8221; and at The American Prospect, Tim Fernholtz said James was exploiting fear against Latino immigrants for political gain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But James says the exams are a public safety issue. On his campaign website, he cited a 2004 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report that connected a 72 percent increase in work/traffic-related fatalities to drivers&rsquo; inability to read road signs in English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Drivers license exams are currently offered in Arabic, Chinese, English, Farsi, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Thai and Vietnamese.</p>

		<p>Alabama - doing what the feds haven&rsquo;t done, aren&rsquo;t doing, and clearly won&rsquo;t do. I think I&rsquo;ll be vacationing in these two great states this year. Thank-you Mr. James.</p>
<p>If all the road signs in Alabama are in English why is the written driving test in 12 different languages.</p>

		<p>In some cities the written test for new drivers is in as many as 20 languages.  I suspect that if the test is only in English a lot of illegals won&rsquo;t be able to obtain driver&rsquo;s licenses unless they can do it illegally.  In NYC there are many Hispanics working for the Dept. of Motor Vehicles and on more than one occasion I believe it was discovered that there were &#8220;rings&#8221; of people  manufacturing licenses for illegal Hispanics for a price.  These Hispanics did not take any tests.  These &#8220;rings&#8221; were uncovered on more than one occasion, but the bottom line is since they have many of their &#8220;bros&#8221; working in Motor Vehicle Departments in almost all major cities this sort of illegal activity may begin to flourish. </p>

		<p>Imagine the expense and SIZE of interstate directional signs if they were to be forced to be in many different languages! right, speak English or GTFO! BTW, I should mention that I practice what I preach, I work in Arabic speaking countries and I learned fairly conversational Arabic, and learning to read and write it. No in Afghanistan where DARI is spoken in the area and I am learning that now!</p>

<p>This is why I have as my dream to one day move back to my &#8220;Sweet Home Alabama&#8221; down South (back to my roots), and move away from the Northern socialist nightmare I live in right now.  If you want to take funding away from us, then have at it.  The stuff you want to give funds to is destructive to our nation anyhow.  Alabama will do just fine on its own, thank you.  Let us break away from the nation if we so desire.  You should have let us do it the first time.</p>

		<p>As a driver license examiner, I can attest WITHOUT ANY QUALIFICATION OR RESERVATION, that minorities in general of all non-white races do not treat the car or driving skills with the respect they deserve.  We privately call any road test with a non-white adult driver a &#8220;death ride.&#8221;  Are there bad white drivers?  Yes, but THEY KNOW BETTER.  Almost all of the drivers of non-white races DON&rsquo;T EVEN KNOW THE KILLING THREAT THAT THEY REPRESENT BEHIND THE WHEEL!  They keep appearing at the DMV hoping that the mere ANNOYANCE FACTOR OF THEIR REPEATED VISITS will make some examiner pass them to &#8220;get them out of their hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly for them, where I work, you actually have to demonstrate all the skills to make the grade&hellip;no charity giveaways!!</p>
<p>As a side note&hellip; the Bush Admin.&rsquo;s decision to extend F-1 student visas from 12 to 29 months has had a very bad impact on driver licensing, as now more than ever, F-1 student visa holders INUNDATE DMV&rsquo;s across the nation hoping to land an American license to drive to support their claim for an H1-B Visa, which will allow them to SUPPLANT A HIGH-TECH AMERICAN WORKER SINCE COMPANIES LOVE TO USE H1-B&rsquo;s TO LOWER THEIR COSTS!!</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it for &#8216;Bama!!!  This is exactly the kind of common-sense approach that is needed in every state in our Union.  Duh, it&rsquo;s the LANGUAGE, s****d!!  What is wrong with demanding that everyone in this country speak English???  In MY book, nothing!  And it&rsquo;s about d**n time we DID demand it, in all 50 states AND in the District of Columbia.  I&rsquo;m tired of having to have everything from drivers&rsquo; tests to ballots to restroom doors in English, Spanish, Korean, Fartsi, Arabic, You Name It!  It&rsquo;s stupid.  I guarantee you they won&rsquo;t put any signs into English in old Mexico&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Forget the driving test, let&rsquo;s get the VOTING PAMPHLETS sent out in English only.  Don&rsquo;t know how it is where you live but here it&rsquo;s sent out in at least 7 languages.  How can you vote on complex issues articulated in English when you don&rsquo;t understand the language?</p>

		<p>ALL  State AND federal government issued forms, tests, and correspondence should be in English ONLY. If the feds threaten to hold back funding to any State, that State needs to END any federally funded program and deny federally supported/mandated services. That includes maintaining the (federal) Interstate Highway system, welfare, medicare, etc.</p>

		<p>I was nearly killed in vehicular accidents by these Hispanic illegal alien invaders more than once. I barely avoided hitting a vehicle driven by them head-on twice, because they deliberately zoom directly towards you in your lane. They drive drunk, without insurance or drivers licenses and they definitely are too ignorant to learn the rules of the road, let alone read street signs in English. The thought of a loved one or friend being pulled out of their car as a mangled corpse is something all Alabamians should entertain when they see a vehicle with Mexicans in it. They have no regard for others, our traffic laws, even themselves.</p>

		<p>A janitor at my previous workplace was an American-born Anglo who couldn&rsquo;t read.  He had no driver&rsquo;s license, and his wife did all the driving.  I assumed he was sans license because he was illiterate.  And, of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe for him to drive if he can&rsquo;t read road signs.  Well, if one doesn&rsquo;t read English, then what&rsquo;s the dif?  And no matter how much the left may argue that so-called universal symbols are used or should be used, most road signs are in words.  And some, such as &#8220;No turn on red between 7am and 2pm&#8221;, are too complicated for symbols.  Others are newer symbols that may not be comprehended by older folks like me or by certain foreigners.  A driver shouldn&rsquo;t have to pause and think about some symbol before figuring it out!</p>

		<p>Although the demand that anyone who drives in Alabama must be proficient in English is a good thing, it&rsquo;s a pretty small step.  What makes it significant, I think, is that this and many other small steps appearing here and there across the country may be the opening skirmishes in the long-overdue White Awakening.<br>

		<p>Thank you, Mr. James. I&rsquo;m proud of my native state, and doubly so coming on the heels of the courage of Gov. Brewer&rsquo;s actions. I hope Alabama adopts the Arizona bill, as well as my present home state, Texas. We have a Representative who plans to put forth the same idea here. I hope that it flies and that all states will go for it. Say hello to my lovely Mobile for me.</p>

		<p>In all seriousness, the test itself should be in English.  We speak English here and all the signs are in English.  Getting stopped by the police is a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate your new English skills!</p>
<p>  Nevertheless, all the driver training materials from the state, such as the manuals and guides should continue to be in the various languages that they are presently.  We want people to know how to drive correctly.  This is more important than a symbolic stance against enforced diversity.  Besides, the materials have already been translated.  <br>
  <br>
  Having a standard reference book in twenty languages is a good way for students in high school to learn comparative linguistics.  Learning to tell Japanese from Chinese from Korean from twenty other languages is a valid skill from any political perspective.  The fact that students are also absorbing the rules of the road is an added benefit from comparing the text from the various driving manuals.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, schools are run by dumb dull people who would never recognize the value of these out-of-sight,-but-in-your-face resources.</p>

		<p>Decades ago I was waiting in line at the DMV in Jamaica, Zoo York City to take the eye test for my driver&rsquo;s license. A Mexican-looking fellow in front of me, when it was his turn to take the test, was told by the woman behind the counter to look and tell her what he saw.  He responded: &#8220;No comprendo.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman (a black) rose to her feet, pointed towards the door and shouted: &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t &#8216;comprendo&rsquo; you can get out of here right now!  I&rsquo;ve got all these people waiting and I haven&rsquo;t got time to be wasting with you!&#8221;  Magically, he suddenly learned how to &#8220;comprende&#8221;.  It was one of the few times in my life I actually wanted to hug and kiss a black woman.</p>
<p>I saw Time James&rsquo; video.  I saw nothing &#8220;racist&#8221; about it.  He doesn&rsquo;t tell people they can&rsquo;t speak other languages; he just tells them they should learn Engliah.  Duh!  </p>
<p>Neither one of my grandfathers could speak English when they first arrived in this country.  Both were conversant in it within a year and fluent several years afterwards.  Why?  They took the time out of their busy schedules (both LEGALLY worked for a living) to learn it!  These latinos (I refuse to call them &#8216;Hispanics&rsquo;, which originally meant people from Spain) get no pity from me.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m sending Tim James&rsquo; campaign a check for $50.  I&rsquo;m only sorry I can&rsquo;t vote for him.</p>

		<p>I understand the need for a common national language, but new legal immigrants should be permitted to drive before completely mastering the English language.</p>
<p>My Christian Russian parents moved to CA before I was born.  I took my CA drivers license in Russian just for fun.  The street signs depicted on the written exam are in English but the multiple choice questions are in Russian.  It would be impossible for someone unable to read English street signs to pass the Russian exam in CA.  People wrongfully assume that proficient knowledge of the English language is required for safe driving in America.  A basic understanding of English is necessary and should be required but non-fluent English speakers should have the opportunity to be tested on the driving laws in their native language.  </p>

		<p>Wow, I hate the press 1 for English scenario, but I never thought of this concept.   We have the driver&rsquo;s test in all these languages, but the signs are all English.  Brilliant!</p>
<p>What amazes me is we put the Spanish word for Trash on garbage in the office.  Even I recognize that word in Spanish now.   If I have to learn various programs on computer systems to underwrite loans, why can&rsquo;t they learn one stupid English word for garbage which is their job?</p>
<p>That means they won&rsquo;t understand the stupid signs&hellip;!!!!  Ever..</p>
