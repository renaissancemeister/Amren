			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Tancredo, Townhall, April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing, many liberals exploited the actions of one deranged individual to tar millions of patriotic Americans as extremists and potential terrorists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an excellent piece &#8220;What&rsquo;s behind the anti-Tea Party hate narrative?&#8221; the Washington Examiner&rsquo;s Chief Washington Correspondent Byron York notes that &#8220;Many of the claims that extremism is on the rise in America originate in research done by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based group that for nearly 40 years has tracked what it says is the growing threat of intolerance in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SPLC is not only taken seriously by the liberal media, but also by the Department of Homeland Security. When they issued their now infamous report on &#8220;Right Wing Extremists&#8221; that warned &#8220;disgruntled&#8221; military veterans will become potential terrorists, they quoted a SPLC report entitled &#8220;A Few Bad Men&#8221; that claims racists are infiltrating the military.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, &#8220;A Few Bad Men&#8221; appeared as the SPLC attacked the American Legion for its support of immigration enforcement, which they called &#8220;Legionnaires&rsquo; Disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is indicative of what the SPLC is really about. Instead of monitoring &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;extremism,&#8221; they are concerned with tarring patriotic Americans who oppose their left wing agenda as haters and extremists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an excellent report put out by the Center for Immigration Studies, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Jerry Kammer detailed the smear tactics used by the Southern Poverty Law Center to silence those in the immigration debate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kammer shows that the SPLC even sees racism in the Lord of the Rings, which one of their columnists called &#8220;little more than a glorified vision of white patriarchy&#8221; in which the heroes &#8220;are manly men who are whiter than white&#8221; and &#8220;are frequently framed in halos of blinding bright light and exude a heavenly aura of all that is Eurocentric and good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SPLC not only sees no problems with left wing racists, they also have no problem with left wing terrorists. Their &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; magazine fawningly interviewed Weatherman terrorist Bill Ayers, who they described merely as a &#8220;civil rights organizer, radical anti-Vietnam War activist, teacher and author&#8221; who &#8220;has developed a rich vision of teaching that interweaves passion, responsibility and self-reflection.&#8221; They did not mention that Ayers set off bombs in the US Capitol, the Pentagon, and the New York City Police Department. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the SPLC in a nutshell. The Lord of the Rings is racist, but a group called &#8220;The Race&#8221; is not. Patriotic Tea Partiers are potential terrorists, but actual terrorists like Bill Ayers are civil rights organizers.<br>

		<p>The best people to combat the SPLC are other leftists, like Ken Silverstein and Carol Swain, who see the SPLC sucking oxygen away from other left wing causes.</p>
<p>Speaking of, after Richard Barrett was murdered last week, the Poverty Palace came out and told the truth, that Barrett was nothing more than an ineffectual gadfly on the &#8220;hard right.&#8221;  Now, when he was living, the same Poverty Palace put him at the center of every dastardly conspiracy on Earth (ones that only existed in the fertile imagine of Morris S. Dees, Esq.), to do whatever dastardly deeds right wingers want to do.  Grounds for Federal charges of wire and mail fraud, if you ask me   &mdash;   raising money based on a pretext you know at the time to be false.</p>

		<p>The SPLC is THE most &#8216;racist&rsquo; organization I know of. Even the naacp will admit whites if they pay their dues. The splc is just the propaganda/public information arm of the adl. THEY are the terrorists ; and support same . </p>

AR has posted a few other critiques of the SPLC. I&rsquo;d like to believe the tide is turning and the splc is being exposed for the self-serving, money generating, anti-white group that it is but too many journalists have bought into the splc lie.</p>

		<p>The Lord of the Rings does have a racial message.   Thats while they are such good movies.   In them the armies of darkness (orcs) and half breeds (Urk-Hai) are lead by traitors (Saruman) and decievers (Sauron) against all that is good.   In the end the world of men and their allies (elves, dwarves and hobbits)  triumph over the armies of darkness.   The victory is won because of the tiny hobbits which are representative of the young white race.  It shows that the future of our people lies in the youth of our people.</p>
<p> Anyway the moral of these books and movies is that we as a people must unite even though some of us are Germans others English and other Russian and all the other glorious brances of the White race, or we will be destroyed by the armies of darkness.</p>
<p>We all should learn from this films message or we will be destroyed.</p>

		<p> Tancredo&rsquo;s excellent article points up what I&rsquo;ve said several other times in AmRen postings: The SCLC is a mischief-making, reputation-smearing Leftist fringe organization which is given about 1,000 times more credibility than it deserves by the mainstream news media.</p>
<p> Go on Wikipedia for information about any number of conservative or White Nationalist organizations, and you&rsquo;ll see a line similar to this: &#8220;The &hellip;&hellip; has been designated as being a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.&#8221; Now, just who appointed the SPLC to be the official &#8220;designator of hate groups&#8221;? The mainstream media, that&rsquo;s who. They have cooperated with the SCLC in an attempt to inflate their importance to an (often) naive and poorly informed general public.</p>
<p> What the SCLC&rsquo;s next designated &#8220;hate group&#8221; needs to do is file a whopping lawsuit against it, for defamation. I&rsquo;m sure attorneys could be found who could work up a case. Make this too-clever-by-half organization pony up a bunch of defense money to defend itself. Maybe it won&rsquo;t be so quick to &#8220;designate&#8221; if it sees legal-fee induced bankruptcy staring it in the face.  </p>

		<p>Rush Limbaugh was talking today about the &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; racism charges against  the Arizona Immigration Law.</p>
<p>He made the point that isn&rsquo;t Affirmative Action really just legalized &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;? </p>
<p>Yes it is.  I&rsquo;m a White American Citizen, and Affirmative Action racially profiles me for denial of job opportunities because of the color of my skin.  The federal government is waging a race war against me, but the MSM wants me to offended that Arizona police might want to know if a suspect is an illegal alien or not.</p>

<p>I respect Congressman Tancredo quite a lot; in fact if I had my way, he would be the President of the USA right now.</p>
<p>However, he is not stating what the true agenda of the SPLC is clearly, which is the total genocide of whites in this country and on the planet. Moreover, he doesn&rsquo;t point out their deranged basis for this unstated  policy of hypocrisy, which is an inherent self-loathing that augers their childish greed for materialistic comforts and political power brokering. A dichotomist pathology to be sure, but one that also successfully feeds both their wallets and wretchedly abnormal &ldquo;egos&rdquo; quite symbiotically.  </p>
<p>The SPLC is unique in this respect, when compared to the other multicultural oriented Marxist terrorist groups in this country (such as, La Raza or the NACCP) in that they practice anti-white racial sadism from a position of comfort, while they also willingly debauch themselves in the &ldquo;gilded&rdquo; masochisms that their workaday sadisms extol as being virtuous. </p>

		<p>This is actually rather exciting - that is, that mainstream figures like Tancredo are calling out that vile institution and its merciless band of self-appointed witch-hunters! While I see very little evidence that white Americans are experiencing any kind of valid racial awakening, it does seem that many are growing very, very tired of being called endless painted as &#8220;racists&#8221; and what not all by opportunists and hucksters who are raking in millions off this whole &#8220;hate&#8221; racket!</p>

<p>The above is another perfect example of how the media has invested so heavily in the image of the &#8220;right wing&#8221; extremist.</p>
<p>Yet over past decades, &#8220;left wingers&#8221; have been far more beligerent and violent.</p>
<p>If Ayers were identified as a &#8220;right winger&#8221;, does anyone believe he would even be allowed to teach at a college university?</p>

		<p>Some have complained that the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> features only whites. Well, the character of Gollum is a completely computer-generated image. Gollum could have been made any color, from black to plaid. Would blacks like to have Gollum made a cafe-au-lait color? I suspect that the answer is that they would like any blacks in the movie to play admirable persons, such as the parts played by Morgan Freeman, and not sneaky characters like Gollum. Hey, in showbiz, work is where you find it!</p>

		<p>The author here nailed it true.  I think the SPLC originally was there for a good intent; there WAS tremendous injustice going on in the South and black people WERE the victims.  That situation needed correcting, and it was.  Then, however, came the demands of blacks for &#8220;something for nothing&#8221; - free money, free education, free job training, free housing, free food - everything they could get their hands on as long as they didn&rsquo;t have to work for it.  As soon as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton started &#8220;victim-izing&#8221; black people whose treatment in the South had already done a 180 degree turn - that&rsquo;s when the trouble started.  SPLC morphed into an entitlement-for-the-victims front for blacks wanting free everything because their ancestors had been slaves.  At this point, we need ANOTHER organization to let the blacks know that their ancestors do not dictate their status today.  No blacks are getting anything at all because they had slave ancestors.  Instead, blacks are going to have to accept REAL equality, and work for their accomplishments just like everyone else does.  They will have to stay in school, refrain from having children when they&rsquo;re teenagers, and refrain from the use of drugs and alcohol.  They will have to go to some type of post-high school training in order to get a good career.  And then they will have to curb their libidos and stop sleeping with everything that looks good with no thought for consequences.  It&rsquo;s really a longwinded way of saying that blacks are going to have to grow up and accept responsibility for their own lives if they want to further themselves in this society.  And if they don&rsquo;t, well, I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of Haitians who would willingly swap places with them.</p>

		<p>Anybody that is taken in by the unintelligent propaganda of the SPLC has got to be some kind of mental defect.  </p>
<p>Their inaccuracies, obvious lies and exaggerations are plain for anybody to see who is not afflicted with some kind of unsophisticated view of things or someone who is just too dense&hellip;or gullible.</p>
<p>Adhering to SPLC ideology is akin to belonging to some kind of wacky sect that has outlandish views not based in reality. </p>

		<p>In February 2010, Tancredo appeared on MSNBC on the Alan Colmes show, and this was about the time Tancredo had stirred up a little gastrointestinal distress over in the anti-white leftist camps by suggesting that Civics tests would be a great idea to determine eligibility before people were allowed to vote.   Colmes, of course, was on a mission to position Tancredo as a &#8216;racist&rsquo; and a &#8216;bigot&rsquo; who wanted to bring back literacy tests (that never should have been dropped) that minorities might not be able to pass, and therefore be rendered unqualified to vote. </p>
<p>Tancredo got in a couple of good licks on the vile Alan Colmes, at one point stating that stupidity was not a franchise that was owned by any particular ethnic group, and that lots of white people were too dumb to pass a civics test, too.   Colmes basically ignored that point - and at a point later in the interview posed the projected scenario of an America that is 35 to 40 percent Hispanic and then asked Tancredo what he thought about that?   </p>
<p>Tancredo, being the de-racinated, white guilt ridden, elitist sort of man who wets his pants when confronted with an opportunity to defend the legitimate ethnic interests of his own race of people - mumbled some pathetic line of baloney that no, he didn&rsquo;t mind if America became 40 percent Mexican - as long as they &#8216;assimilated&rsquo;.   He then began to assure Colmes that he didn&rsquo;t think in terms of race!    </p>
<p>So, fellow AR readers, here we are - involved in what is clearly an undeclared race war - its been raging for over 40 plus years, and the Cultural Marxists from the Frankfurt School who have been behind this effort to genocide people of European descent have somehow managed to brainwash the handful of our political leaders into refusing to specifically and unapologetically speak out in defense of White, Western Man?  </p>
<p>We need white men and women who will challenge leftists like Alan Colmes and go on the offensive - and demand that they explain why it is that whites - and only whites - are not supposed be concerned about their legitimate ethnic interests?  <br>
Challenge leftists like Colmes to explain why whites should not resist being reduced to a minority, since that equates to being subjugated to rule by  non-whites who have shown every indication through their statements and behavior and past voting habits to be hostile to the legitimate ethnic interests of the white majority? </p>
<p>Lastly, every pro-white spokesman or spokeswoman, when appearing on these leftist, anti-white TV venues should carry with them the official 1947/1948 Convention on the Crime and Punishment of Genocide document, and cite specific passages to the anti-white leftist host and to the viewing audiences and ask these snotty liberals to explain why they support the genocide of White people of European descent.   </p>

<p>The SPLC was NEVER started for good intent. Neither was the ALCU, as many have been told over and again. BOTH were set up to destroy White America. As for blacks being the eternal victim, I do not buy into that either. Blacks were criminals and White haters from day one. Whites have always been the scapegoats because they are easy targets (delusional) and the ones who have the money (taxes) that nonwhites so dearly love to steal!</p>

		<p>DixieProud, the SPLC exists purely and simply because under civil rights law, the attorneys bringing the suit get payed whether they win or NOT.  Morris Dees is and always has been a race hustler the same as Sharpton and Jackson, but of the white semitic kind.  The reason he finds racists and intolerance everywhere is because it&rsquo;s good for business.  No racism or intolerance, no business and credibility nor need for the SPLC.  The more racism and intolerance, the more &#8220;need&#8221; for the SPLC and the more he can generate donations and lawsuits.  By the way, WHEN was the last time Morris Dees launched a lawsuit?  He&rsquo;s been raking in donations for decades.  Has he even filed a lawsuit over the last ten years that anybody has heard about which actually made it through the courts?  He keeps the hysteria going so the donations keep rolling in, and so that he continues to get face time with the liberal media, so more donations keep rolling in.  And by the way, WHAT was the big crime in the South in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s?  Wanting to remain separate from the tribe that is currently murdering us and draining our economy with entitlements now that they are among us and have political power?  How horrible to have been prescient enough to know exactly what would develop from integration, race mixing, and empowerment of a retarded segment of society.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And by the way, WHAT was the big crime in the South in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>White southerners did not take &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; seriously.  Black schools and other institutions were egregiously inferior to white institutions in the first part of the twentieth century, and few white people gave a damn, as long as blacks kept quiet.  Also, there was a large measure of gratutitous cruelty and belittlement on the part of Southern whites towards blacks.  Wolters acknowledges this in paragraph 3 of following article, published in Occidental Quarterly:<br>

		<p>Poster #17 has it right.</p>
<p>Tancredo got in a couple of good licks on the vile Alan Colmes, at one point stating that stupidity was not a franchise that was owned by any particular ethnic group, and that lots of white people were too dumb to pass a civics test, too. Colmes basically ignored that point - and at a point later in the interview posed the projected scenario of an America that is 35 to 40 percent Hispanic and then asked Tancredo what he thought about that?</p>
<p>Tancredo, being the de-racinated, white guilt ridden, elitist sort of man who wets his pants when confronted with an opportunity to defend the legitimate ethnic interests of his own race of people - mumbled some pathetic line of baloney that no, he didn&rsquo;t mind if America became 40 percent Mexican - as long as they &lsquo;assimilated&rsquo;. He then began to assure Colmes that he didn&rsquo;t think in terms of race!</p>
<p>So, fellow AR readers, here we are - involved in what is clearly an undeclared race war - its been raging for over 40 plus years, and the Cultural Marxists from the Frankfurt School who have been behind this effort to genocide people of European descent have somehow managed to brainwash the handful of our political leaders into refusing to specifically and unapologetically speak out in defense of White, Western Man? </p>
<p>Tancredo is just like all the rest of most White men today, sad to say.  They don&rsquo;t seem to care that they are being displaced in their own LANDS! </p>
<p>They will NEVER defend their own race because they are as brainwashed as most Whites are. For any White not to care about their own land filling up with nonwhites is a mental sickness, not to mention cowardly and pathetic for ANY race to think like that! It is okay for nonwhites to demand that the White man get out of their own countries but for a White man to demand nonwhites to get out of ours is unthinkable.</p>

		<p>A recent or current (?) issue of Social Contract has a rather<br>
comprehensive analysis of SPLC done mainly by Kevin Lamb.  In<br>
effect, the SPLC arises out of the vacuum left by reforms in<br>
the 70&rsquo;s that set out to prevent &#8220;cointelpro&#8221; reoccurences by agencies like FBI and AFT.  Being in a formal sense a non-governmental entity, SPLC is free of the intrusions and corrective capacities of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act.  It has no funding strings reaching into Congressional oversight committees.  There is a good bit of necesssarily circumstantial evidence of massive information exchange between SPLC and federal law enforcement entities, if sometimes mediated through state or local law enforcement.  SPLC is the huge &#8220;elephant at the tea party&#8221; within current law enforcement  &mdash;  federal, state, andlocal  &mdash;   and reaching into Homeland Insecurity.  It seems off target to dwell upon the facade of  Dees as a variant of Elmer Gantry, wielding a legal pad instead of a pentacostal Bible.  The outfit is a quasi governmental police entity without any real civil governing influence upon it.  There&rsquo;s is among abler and principled persons within the FBI and local law enforcement no real &#8220;hidden agenda&#8221; regarding SPLC.  The salient mission of SPLC is very clearly perceived.  </p>

		<p>Mass immigration, raising taxes, affirmative action and &#8220;hate&#8221; laws are all part of the bigger agenda. Mass immigration is a form of ethnic cleansing, raising taxes is literally taking from hard-working Whites to give to non-Whites,  affirmative action ensures employment for everyone but Whites and &#8220;hate&#8221; laws ensure the advancement of all non-Whites with the aid of White People. Yes we have been duped and continue to live under the delusion that we are still in charge and being noble when in fact we are being victimized each and every day by groups such as the SPLC and have already lost our power. The situation is not hopeless unless we do nothing about it. </p>

I saw the blatant maltreatment of blacks; that is undeniable for anyone who is interested in the truth.  However, over time and with civil rights legislation, blacks no longer have to endure the old ways.  And if you weren&rsquo;t there, you know nothing about it. It had to be experienced to know what it was really like.  So I do see SPLC as having a good intent initially.  But over time, it morphed into supporting the victimhood position of blacks.  Then it became an evil organization, in my opinion.  I refuse to see myself as a victim - that is a demeaning and devaluing way to look at myself and my race, and I will have nothing to do with it.  I am NOT going to use the &#8220;tools&#8221; of the SPLC for myself and lower myself to their level.  It is unnecessary.  Brains always win over brawn, and I believe we will win a peace worth having one of these days.

		<p>My friends, don&rsquo;t worry!  Social justice will transform everything into a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; utopia.  Avatar is the Left&rsquo;s answer to Lord of the Rings!  </p>
<p>In Avatar, blue skinned characters with distinctly black facial features are in touch with nature and the rhythms of feelings and emotion.  They ride beasts and are more than a match for whitey technology!</p>
<p>And furthermore, worry not about those nasty old white films filled with white characters based faithfully on the original books and myths!  Just as we saw a recent movie that featured a black man playing one of the Greek gods, revisionist story telling will see a remake of the Lord of the Rings in the future with Aragorn played by Will Smith, the Elves will be modeled after the Ashanti of Africa and speak their tongue and the Orcs will be little mis-shapen white guys with spears. Oh, Denzel Washington or Morgan Freemen can (appropriately) play the part of Gandalf.</p>

<p>But how was it bad for whites?  I mean, white kids weren&rsquo;t going to a school with the fear of getting assaulted or raped.  Most white neighborhoods, since they were free to exclude blacks, didn&rsquo;t have to worry about Tyrone and his &#8220;bruthaz&#8221; bringing in drugs, gang violence, and prostitution.  Whites weren&rsquo;t being forced to shell out government money to support blacks and other things that would be destructive to the interestes of whites.</p>

<p>How was it scary for WHITES? I also do not buy that blacks had it so hard back in the South. SEGREGATION was the best for BOTH sides. Blacks had their own schools, neighborhoods, businesses, and for the most part they had their families intact with FATHERS in the home! So WHY did they have to invade all White schools, neighborhoods etc? It is ten times worse now for American society to be desegregated than the reverse!</p>
<p>  Also &#8220;blacks no longer have to endure the old ways&#8221;? No, but we Whites sure have to endure the unleashing of blacks upon White society don&rsquo;t we? Look what is happening to our kids in the schools, in our own neighborhoods and cities and tell me it was so horrible back then.<br>

		<p>As bad as the SPLC is the real evil is well hidden from the general public.  If it wasn&rsquo;t for a few loyal American police officers we would not know the extent of the evil that is planned for this country by the SPLC.  In particular, the nation&rsquo;s &#8220;Fusion Centers&#8221;, sixty or so Homeland Security law enforcement research groups composed of local, state and federal entities have been targeted by Dees, et al.  So far so good, they are there to protect us against the Islamic terrorists and Nazis, right.  No, they are being fed lies that faithful Americans are the enemy.  Those Christians, gun owners, anti-immigrationists, etc. are the enemy, so says the SPLC.  The SPLC feeds our country&rsquo;s law enforcement poison through these centers.  Clearly biased reports on the dangerous &#8220;groups&#8221; in this country.  Groups that are for the most part conservative and white.  I thought the police would just toss this stuff in the garbage.  I was wrong.  The latest info. that I have from LE personnel, particularly trainers, is that this stuff is now being taken seriously in major forces throughout the US.  We are a step closer to the collapse, thanks to the SPLC.</p>

<p>Grow up, my friend.  There&rsquo;s no amount of useless rhetoric that is going to change things.  It takes actively participating in, and belonging to, an activist movement of some kind to make a difference.</p>
