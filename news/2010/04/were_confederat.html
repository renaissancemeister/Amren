<h1>Were Confederate Soldiers Terrorists?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roland S. Martin, CNN, April 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In criticizing me for saying that celebrating the Confederates was akin to honoring Nazi soldiers for killing of Jews during the Holocaust, Rob Wagner said, &#8220;I am simply defending the honor and dignity of men who were given no choice other than to fight, some as young as thirteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sherry Callahan said that supporting the Confederacy is &#8220;our history. Not hate; it&rsquo;s about heritage and history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Javier Ramirez called slavery evil, but prefaced his remarks by saying that &#8220;Confederate soldiers were never seen as terrorists by [President Abraham] Lincoln or U.S. generals on the battlefield. They were accorded POW status, they were never tried for war crimes. Not once did Confederate soldiers do any damage to civilians or their property in their invasion of the north. The same is not true of Union soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Realskirkland sent me a Tweet saying, &#8220;Slavery is appalling, but was not the only reason for the CW [Civil War]. Those men {snip} embodied that American ideal that the states have a right to govern themselves. {snip}</p>
<p>If you take all of these comments, don&rsquo;t they sound eerily similar to what we hear today from Muslim extremists who have pledged their lives to defend the honor of Allah and to defeat the infidels in the West?</p>
<p>When you make the argument that the South was angry with the North for &#8220;invading&#8221; its &#8220;homeland,&#8221; Osama bin Laden has said the same about U.S. soldiers being on Arab soil. {snip} Is there really that much of a difference between him and the Confederates? Same language; same cause; same effect.</p>
<p>If a Confederate soldier was merely doing his job in defending his homeland, honor and heritage, what are we to say about young Muslim radicals who say the exact same thing as their rationale for strapping bombs on their bodies and blowing up cafes and buildings?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Defenders of the Confederacy say that innocent people were killed in the Civil War; hasn&rsquo;t the same argument been presented by Muslim radicals in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places where the U.S. has tangled with terrorists?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t on the one hand justify the actions of Confederates as being their duty as valiant men of the South, and then condemn the Muslim extremists who want to see Americans die a brutal death. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just as radical Muslims have a warped sense of religion, Confederate supporters have a delusional view of what is honorable. The terrorists are willing to kill their own to prove their point, and the Confederates were just as willing in the Civil War to take up arms against their fellow Americans to justify their point.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re a relative of one of the 9/11 hijackers, that man was an out-and-out terrorist, and nothing you can say will change that. And if your great-great-great-granddaddy was a Confederate who stood up for Southern ideals, he too was a terrorist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And I will never, under any circumstances, cast Confederates as heroic figures who should be honored and revered. No  &mdash;  they were, and forever will be, domestic terrorists.</p>

		<p>The most basic and important difference between Confederate soldiers and Islamic terrorists is how many hot brunette girls over 5&rsquo;9&#8221; you can pick up at a Halloween costume party. I`ll never forget seeing some  some guy dressed as Jeb Stuart drowning in female attention as opposed to the guy wearing a Yassir Arafat type get-up. <br>

		<p> Nice try, Roland. But your arguments are about as puerile and unconvincing as those of most liberal columnists.</p>
<p> Confederates as &#8220;terrorists&#8221;? The word was unknown, hadn&rsquo;t been coined yet, during the Civil War. Confederates fought Union soldiers; they didn&rsquo;t blow up innocent men, women and children (along with themselves) in peaceful market places or on passenger trains. They DID view the South as &#8220;their&#8221; land, and the Northerners as invaders. And as a matter of fact, recent research has shown that a significant number of black Southerners felt the same way, and fought for the Confederacy.</p>
<p> Was slavery THE only cause of the Civl War? It was a major cause, yes. But not the only one. The North&rsquo;s embrace of the Industrial Revolution, much more than the agrarian South did; major differences on States Rights vs. National Sovereignty; and other bones of contention also contributed. To say that the war was &#8220;only&#8221; about slavery shows a politically correct, inaccurate view of American history.</p>
<p> The Confederate Army, nearly always out-numbered and out-gunned by the Union Army, managed not only to hold out for four long years, but also inflicted a significant number of stinging defeats on the North. You can view the Boys in Gray in any way that you want, Roland; but many, many Americans will disagree with you.</p>

		<p>Aside from his anti-white fanaticism, and the hypocrisy of someone like Mr. Martin saying these things, when any other time he would demand that we be sensitive to Muslims, and try to understand their plight, the analogy is nowhere near valid.</p>
<p>There were five clear and easy opportunities from the Army of Northern Virginia literally to vandalize Washington, D.C. and kill Abraham Lincoln, let Lee declined every time.  The reason he declined is because he wanted to keep the Confederate effort focused on defense.  He feared that if he crossed the Potomac, he would have really crossed a Rubicon in terms of PR in the North   &mdash;   He was banking on pro-South sympathies north of the Mason-Dixon undercutting the Union effort.  Robert Edward Lee would have never considered destroying the two tallest buildings in the area that remained in the Union.</p>

		<p>Comparing Johnny Reb to Jihaddis may be apt, but the prior Nazi reference by Mr. Martin proves bias in his motives.<br>
The loss of such a talented group as European Jews cannot be compared to anything the Confederacy did, or could have done, even had it been genocidal in its treatment of blacks. To equate the loss of Jews (or most any group) and blacks to a modern society is historically inept, they are just not commensurate.</p>

		<p>Other than being black, I would like to know what exactly Roland S. Martin did that qualifies him to speak about anything. For God&rsquo;s sake, he has an unaccredited degree in &#8220;Christian Communications.&#8221; It is clear to me that he cannot distinguish between uniformed, organized soldiers (the Confederates) and guerrilla terrorists (Al Qaeda).</p>

		<p>Looks like I come from a long line of terrorists, Mr. Martin. I looked up my family&rsquo;s name in the Alabama Historical Society&rsquo;s page of those who fought in the Civil War. There are 30 names of my relatives. Even though I consider slavery a blot on our history, it happened. It&rsquo;s also true that Africans sold their friends and neighbors to those who brought them to America. So, there is enough blame to go around. Yet, we here nothing about that. Were they also terrorists or does it only work one way.</p>

<p>Those could well be his thoughts, generally, but I&rsquo;ll lay ten to one odds for any amount of money a white colleague dressed it up into an acceptable form.  This man is an absolute moron, and he&rsquo;s a prime example of blacks with AA degrees who get AA law certification.</p>

		<p>I am betting this guy has never worn a uniform of the US armed services.  In fact, I&rsquo;d bet he hates the military.  Moreover, I&rsquo;d BET his IQ is right at the average for black men - high functional retarded.  He obviously has no sense of American history, of common  sense and values (do any black men?) and basically just hates all Southerners who are white.  Past, present, and future.  I&rsquo;m also betting he&rsquo;d never call Nelson Mandela, the Mau Mau, the killers of white farmers in the dead of the night, or the regimes of ANY black nation &#8220;terrorists&#8221;.  Nope, I&rsquo;d bet not.</p>

		<p>I must wonder if this half-wit is defending Muslim Terrorists or is just confused about the rules of land warfare, which Sherman thoroughly ignored.  </p>
<p>It is more likely that this bigoted hater is just using the Civil War as a means to attack white people, which is the norm for this anti-white bigot.   </p>
<p>I really doubt that slavery is the real issue with him since Muslims had and killed many more slaves than white Americans ever did.  <br>

		<p>This dude doesn&rsquo;t know history.  The North invaded the South&rsquo;s territory, not the other way around, and the South defended its homeland.  Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s homeland is SAUDI ARABIA, not Pakistan, not Afganistan, and certainly not Iraq.  Nobody has invaded Saudi Arabia.  Also, these &#8220;history revisionists&#8221; make the supremely stupid error of judging the past by the standards of today, thus rendering their judgment null and void, and meaningless.  But this man wants to get publicity for jumping on the &#8220;we were slaves so you owe us&#8221; mentality bandwagon.  Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have made careers out of that, and I&rsquo;m sure this guy would like to get a part of that action.  Too bad he isn&rsquo;t interested in historical truth or accuracy.  The only place you&rsquo;ll get that is by reading the documents of that time.  The opinions bandied about today regarding the War of Northern Aggression are like noses - everybody&rsquo;s got one, and some blow more hot air than others.</p>

		<p>But the two heroic black males at the voting station walking around outside telling whites &#8220;you are about to be ruled by a black man, cracker&#8221; are heroes that should be emulated in the black community? Just another statement that seeks to paint all whites as racists. He can&rsquo;t live with the fact that not all conferate soldiers were fighting to preserve slavery. Most fought to repel Federal invaders and for States Rights. To compare them to Islamic terrorists is absurd. The confederates did not plan to invade or convert the north to slavery. They did not seek to kill indiscrimately as do Islamic terrorists.<br>
This guy is just another black male lost in his fear of reality and truth.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t on the one hand justify the actions of Confederates as being their duty as valiant men of the South, and then condemn the Muslim extremists who want to see Americans die a brutal death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor can we degrade the legitimate actions of the CSA, by comparing them to the: ANC, PLO, or the IRA.</p>
<p>The Confederacy fought and lost a legitimate and declared war against the Union for its independence; they never, nor did they ever, advocate terrorism. If they had, what might have happened in: Philadelphia, Washington, Boston, or New York over 100 years ago following that defeat, or to this day even and ongoing?</p>
<p>With both honor and vigorous dignity, the Confederacy became our &ldquo;reunited&rdquo; South; it has never been since then, a hotbed of political murder or savagery. It has defended itself, but not through Marxist, or even &ldquo;liberationist,&rdquo; revolutionary tactics. </p>
<p>Comrade Martin, that is something to really ponder; that is, if you can figure out how ponder and propagandizing differ?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I am too outraged by this piffle to say much beyond this; No, the Soldiers of the Confederate States were not Terrorists, though very real Terrorists did exist at the time. For example John Brown of Ossawatomie, a terrorist and cold blooded murderer by any account. Nor let us forget that Mr. Lincoln introduced not only the draft, but the suspension of Habeus Corpus and innumerable other attrocities upon the Constitution. </p>
<p>Sure, slavery was vile and most of us wish it had never even taken place (we would be a much happier nation without the end product of slavery divesting our treasury I can assure you) but I also find it abhorrent that white children were chained to machines in northern factories by the same browbeating hypocrites that gave to abolition societies and encouraged -nay, financed and underwrote John Brown&rsquo;s treason and terrorism.</p>
<p>The Civil War was first and foremost about States Rights to self determination vs. the overreaching and draconian Federal Beast.</p>

		<p>These attacks will become more shrill during 2011-2015. The message is that if you remember the good Confederacy, you will be branded a racist and loose your job and career.  If social and economic circumstances are worse, then people will naturally gravitate toward the Confederate heroes, and the media will become less influential and more hostile.  Just wait till March 2017 when we relive the 150th of Reconstruction.  It gave rights to blacks who used them for graft and corruption, then was abandoned.   We are headed toward real trouble in the near future.</p>

		<p>I like it when black commentators speak hate against American heroes. Drives more incipient Whites in our direction.   Whites who are offended by Martin need to learn to start talking about the failures of black society at living up to MLK&rsquo;s dreams and the gift of emancipation, civil rights, diversity mandates, etc.</p>
<p>Blacks are eager to demand benefits from Whites and then condemn Whites for not doing enough.   Whites will wake up one day and stop making non negotiated concessions.    That day, we well demand that blacks prove their merit before we do anything for them.   Nobody gave us anything.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Mr. Martin knows what a Confederate Battle Flag looks like.  I take him as a sort of dunce that would confuse the British Union Jack for a CBF, which many blacks do.</p>
<p>18 True Blue:  It was even worse than that.  Most of those children chained to factories were Irish, and the factory owners that did the chaining funded Lincoln, who eventually shifted the propaganda to the horrors of slavery.  When he tried to drash Irishmen in New York City, they rightly reacted to the hypocrisy.  Didn&rsquo;t matter in the long run; Lincoln and Co. tricked starving Irishmen in Ireland to come over and fight for the Union Army in exchange for land   &mdash;   which they never would have gotten even if they had lived, and they didn&rsquo;t live because Grant&rsquo;s &#8220;strategy&#8221; was nothing more than a pounding meat grinder, push push push until Lee ran out of men, which he did about 145 years ago now.</p>

		<p>I am deeply moved and deeply stirred by the resounding defense of the late Southern Confederacy as exemplified by the comments above.  When I saw the title of this article today, I was tempted not to read it at first (my blood pressure really does need to stay under control), but I gave in and read it after all.  I&rsquo;d like to recommend as some required reading for the leftie loonies THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT GUIDE TO AMERICAN HISTORY, by Dr. Thomas E. Woods, Jr., who earned his bachelor&rsquo;s in history at Harvard and his master&rsquo;s and doctorate at Columbia U.  It opened my eyes to many things.  The Confederate States of America as a nation was exercising the same rights to self determination that the Colonies had exercised in their separation from Britain, which had led to the Revolutionary War.  After our winning of the Revolution, the founding fathers were careful to guard, in the Constitution and in their pamphlets and other writings, their clear intent to guard the right of the governed to throw off the shackles of an oppressive government when that pressing need arose. As stated above in other comments, I wish the USA had never seen the stain of slavery at all.  It is not my intent to try to defend an institution that I cannot defend.  Therefore, while slavery was an issue which would have likely resolved itself peacefully in the normal course of affairs, it was but one of a number of reasons as to why the Southern states felt compelled to leave the union. Among these were federal interference with the South&rsquo;s commerce and the growing specter of federal domination over facets of government rightly left to the states.  Does this remind you of something:   today&rsquo;s massive federal government and their interference in our daily lives, maybe?  There&rsquo;s not enough room here to say much more.  President Jefferson Davis did a good job of defending the CSA along constitutional lines.  </p>
<p>I have no patience at all with the vast ignorance of American history displayed by the author of this article.  It seems that these days everyone is getting on board being offended by something.  This article is an offense to any Southerner worth his or her salt. I am the great-grandson of two Confederate soldiers and the great-great-grandson of three more, and I defy anyone to get in my face and call any of my ancestors &#8220;terrorists&#8221; or to compare them with the Nazis.  They fought honorably and gallantly against an invading force in the War Between the States.  Lincoln was determined to save the &#8220;union,&#8221; and he did, but at a tremendous price in blood on both sides.   I must say then, that when war was forced upon us, at least we killed more of them than they did of us. </p>

<p>&#8220;Even if you&rsquo;re a relative of one of the 9/11 hijackers, that man was an out-and-out terrorist, and nothing you can say will change that. And if your great-great-great-granddaddy was a Confederate who stood up for Southern ideals, he too was a terrorist.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The greatest terrorist of the Civil War was not a confederate but William Tecumseh Sherman, who waged war against innocent civilians in a manner that would have liberals howling for a tribunal in The Hague if it were not done in an officially Approved Cause. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to know whether this fool (Martin, not Sherman) has the slightest knowledge of what landed Nelson Mandela in jail, and whether those actions constitute &#8220;terrorism&#8221; in his opinion.</p>

		<p>I love the Southern people, and the contributions that they have made in making America great. But I have never supported the Confederate cause. I understand that Southerners are a proud people who do not want to speak ill of their ancestors, and I cannot expect a Southerner to be objective in judging his family members from the 1860s.</p>
<p>But we have to speak some hard truths. It was the Confederates in South Carolina who fired the first shots at Fort Sumter, which was a union fort. If Cuba was to direct artillery fire against Guantanamo Bay, an American military base, the US government would view it as a declaration of war. We have to accept the fact that there were too many hot-headed Southerners at the time Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860, and they did not want want reasoned dialogue. Abraham Lincoln was a typical American politician, and there is no doubt that he would have given the South almost everthing that they wanted.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the Civil War was an unnecessary war that America could easily have avoided. It was the greatest loss of white lives in American history, and most of the dead represented the best blood of the white race. If those 600,000 whites had lived, their descendants would number in the tens of millions. It was a racial loss that America has never recovered from, because those Americans were part of the pioneering stock that built pre-1860 America.</p>
<p>Some people regard the defeat of the South as a tragedy. How many people believe that we would be better off, if America had been split into two? How would the South have ended up, being a society that depended on black labor? Would they have become like South Africa and Brazil? Perhaps, today, we would be seeing white Southerners fleeing a majority non-white South, in the same manner in which Afrikaners from South Africa are fleeing to America and Europe. About one million whites have left South Africa since 1994. </p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where the Confederacy had won Independence in, say, 1862, as a result of British, French, and Spanish support. The vast majority of Southerners were not slave-holders, and major slaveholding was confined to a small and greedy Southern aristocracy. The Confederacy forbade the importation of more slaves, but it is possible that the greedy Southern elites could have lobbied for the importation of more black slaves to increase their profits. Would we be seeing, in 2010, white Southerners coming as refugees to a lilly-white USA, fleeing the effects of black crime? Those who read the historical novels of Harry Turtledove, may be familiar with such alternative history scenarios.</p>
<p>To those Southerners whose ancestors did not own slaves, but fought for the Confederacy, anyway. Your ancestors were suckers. Your brave ancestors had no dog in that fight. They fought bravely for a greedy and corrupt Southern elite, that was only interested in increasing their own wealth. It was that same greedy elite that later formed a significant part of the scalawags, who betrayed the South during the Reconstruction era. We should not assume that a Confederate victory would have been automatically good for whites. Today, a corrupt white elite is bringing in thirdworlders, which makes you wonder whether whites are doomed to lose their countries in the long-term.    </p>

		<p>Okay, I understand the connection between the Muslims wanting us out of their lands and the Confederates wanting the north out of their lands.  This is natural among humans to not want the &#8216;other&rsquo; in one&rsquo;s own home.  (Would that multiculturalists understood this and the coming apocalypse in Amerika.)</p>
<p>But I do take umbrage at calling confederates terrorists.  I, like many Americans, have ancestors that fought on both sides of the conflict.  I am proud of the fighting men on both sides.  It was a contest of men over deep seated issues.</p>
<p>No southern soldier went to war wanting to defend slavery.  I am unaware of mass diaries from confederate men saying they want to defend slavery on the battlefield that day.  They always spoke of defending the home states and states rights, an issue that goes back to the founding fathers.</p>
<p>Slavery was bad.  Yes it was, and I curse the slave owners who imported 600,000 blacks to this land that have become 30 million today.  But the soldiers were honest men like you and I.  Almost none of them every had any slaves.  The great majority were famers on small plots.  </p>

		<p>Even here on Amren the total lack of knowledge of the history of the civil war is void. First and foremost the war was not fought over slavery. Lincoln brought it into play three years into the war, since most of those in the north had no real reason to fight, and early on the South was kicking butt. Even Grant,who Mrs. Lincoln herself called a butcher stated if he had ever thought for one minute the war was to free slaves, he would have turned all his men and arms over to the confederacy.The north/Lincoln, had blockaded all ports,and those in the south were actually starving,and unable to do commerce. Thus the shot heard round the world. And even though I myself live in what would have been part of the union, I must admit the true war crimes were commited by the north, since Lincoln&rsquo;s secretary A mr. Seward threw out the rules of war that had been in place since the roman empire, allowing the killing of women, children, the old, and the disabled. The only thing required for this to happen was the leaders could allow it. Sherman, and others then marched through the south killing, raping, and burning,everything in their path. Thus because their families were being destroyed contrary to the rules of war, the freedom fighters of the south gave up. How ironic that a part of a country that had just scant few years before gained freedom through secession from king George, was considered traiterous by Lincoln for secession, especially when the constition allowed for the same. Let us not allow the rewriting of our history. UNITED states, INDEED!!   </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the means used by Osama that make him a terrorist but the fact that he only represents a group that&rsquo;s not recognized as a nation. He is in no position to declare war and fight a legal war in the open. He would be in no position to sign a peace treaty and end a war. </p>

		<p>No, the Confederate soldiers were not terrorists because they first and foremost were a regular army and navy. They wore uniforms, they has a chain of command, they also followed a code of military justice. However, both sides did employ terror tactics against each other, General Sherman&rsquo;s march to the sea being one instance of many. There were however at least as many guerrillas as regular solders on both sides of the Civil War who were genuine terrorists. Thugs and killers such as Bloody Bill Anderson, Jesse James and others massacred civilians, burned towns and attacked regular soldiers in ambushes, even killing them as they slept. For years after the Armistice was signed at Appomattox, these guerrillas not only refused to lay down their arms, they continued merciless attacks. That lead to federal troops hunting down and killing them. To call however southerners who fought for their legitimate interests is an attack against white Americans living today. We are in a situation where in the future we may have to take up arms again to defend our interests, even our very lives. The word terrorist is also used as a label for demonizing the very people government kill, torture, abuse and exploit.<br>

		<p>Funny how my post pointing out the fact that he is using the premise that came to prominence after 9/11, especially on the right (namely all muslims are terrorist), to denigrate American history, but you allow DL to spew his ignorance all over the place.</p>
<p>Since Fort Sumter was in Charleston Harbor doesn&rsquo;t the fort revert back to SC after SC leaves the Union?  Would the north allowed the resupply of a southern fort in NYC harbor?  I somehow missed the memo that Fort Sumter was actually built on a piece of land that Washington D.C. considered its own.</p>
<p>Instead of Turtledove, I suggest De Lorenzo and Woods.  Your flights are fancy are just as goofy as the people on the left who state that the South would&rsquo;ve come to the rescue of the Nazis if they would&rsquo;ve won&hellip;</p>
<p>There is a simple logic, which ideological defenders of the Union have sought to discredit.  The South had as much of a right to leave as the individual states had to leave GB.  The might didn&rsquo;t make the &#8220;god-given&#8221; right right, it only defended the inherit right.  If you agree that The 13 Colonies were right and had the right to leave GB then you have to agree that SC had the right to leave the Union.</p>
<p>Just like when you shoot an intruder in your house at night.  The bullet didn&rsquo;t create the right for you to live in peace; it just defended that principle.</p>
<p>The South was right; they just lost the fight to prove it.  </p>
<p>But anyone who pretends to know how race relations would be in 2010 if a war fought in 1861-1865 went different would do their imaginations a service if they spent it debating Star Trek.</p>

		<p>I am deeply moved and deeply stirred by the resounding defense of the late Southern Confederacy as exemplified by the comments above.  When I saw the title of this article today, I was tempted not to read it at first (my blood pressure really does need to stay under control), but I gave in and read it after all.  I&rsquo;d like to recommend as some required reading for the leftie loonies THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT GUIDE TO AMERICAN HISTORY, by Dr. Thomas E. Woods, Jr., who earned his bachelor&rsquo;s in history at Harvard and his master&rsquo;s and doctorate at Columbia U.  It opened my eyes to many things.  The Confederate States of America as a nation was exercising the same rights to self determination that the Colonies had exercised in their separation from Britain, as exemplified by the Revolutionary War.  After our winning of the Revolution, the founding fathers were careful to express, in the Constitution and in their pamphlets and other writings, their clear intent to guard the right of the governed to throw off the shackles of an oppressive government when that pressing need arose. As stated above in other comments, I wish the USA had never seen the stain of slavery at all.  It is not my intent to try to defend an institution that I cannot defend.  Therefore, while slavery was an issue which would have likely resolved itself peacefully in the normal course of affairs, it was but one of a number of reasons as to why the Southern states felt compelled to leave the union. Among these were federal interference with the South&rsquo;s commerce and the growing specter of federal domination over facets of government rightly left to the states.  Does this remind you of something:   today&rsquo;s massive federal government and its interference in our daily lives, maybe?  There&rsquo;s not enough room here to say much more.  President Jefferson Davis, in his writings, did a good job of defending the CSA along constitutional lines.  </p>

		<p>Most of this is drivel but Martin is on to something when he points out that the arguments in support of Confederate resistance are quite similar to bin Laden&rsquo;s justification for his war on the West, specifically the US.</p>
<p>Fort Sumter = Prince Sultan Air Base</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to excuse the actions of the Islamic fundamentalists, but you can&rsquo;t deny the argument IS largely the same.</p>

		<p>Anyone such as Martin who would make a statement comparing the Confederate South to the Islamic jihadists shows such a complete ignorance of history as to be laughable, and certainly worthless of further discourse.</p>

<p>The argument may be similar, but the <i>actions</i> are worlds apart. The Confederates fought on their own turf, against an army invading it and killing their people. If they had been sneaking up to PA or NY and killing innocent civilians who had nothing to do with Lincoln&rsquo;s invasion, then maybe you&rsquo;d have a comparison. One might even make a comparison between a Confederate and an Iraqi civilian firing at US troops invading his home (after all, war is war on both sides). But no valid comparison exists between the actions of Osama bin Laden and the Confederate soldiers.</p>
<p>Also, your equation of Fort Sumter to Prince Sultan Base is off, as PSAB is there with the cooperation of the Saudi government (whatever you might think of them). If they were to change that policy, or be removed and a new government put in there place, then your comparison might be more apt.</p>

<p><i>To those Southerners whose ancestors did not own slaves, but fought for the Confederacy, anyway. Your ancestors were suckers. Your brave ancestors had no dog in that fight.</i></p>
<p>You mean other than the fact that they were attacked? The Union army didn&rsquo;t attack the elites of whom you speak, they attacked the regular civilian population. Brutally. That seems like a pretty big dog to me.</p>
<p>You do have one point: there is no guarantee that a successful southern secession would have made a better situation for white people. But there is no guarantee that it wouldn&rsquo;t, either. There is no way to calculate how the country, indeed the world, might have been different had the south not lost. We simply will never know. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about his credentials, and frankly I don&rsquo;t care. They&rsquo;re irrelevant. Mr. Martin&rsquo;s missive here demonstrates that whatever his background may be, he is still a simple minded and ignorant fool. The reasons why have been thoroughly outed throughout this thread.</p>
<p>As far as his &#8220;getting paid,&#8221; I don&rsquo;t know who here is making good money and who isn&rsquo;t. I myself live comfortably. However, if he&rsquo;s getting paid to write this foolishness, and I&rsquo;m offering my far more sound, informed and well reasoned opinion here, then I guess you&rsquo;re getting a much better deal from me than CNN is getting from him. :p </p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>

		<p>  Slavery was a dying institution. It would&rsquo;ve died in the South as well, as the Southerners saw the benefits of industrialization. Can anyone here say that it would&rsquo;ve been devastaing if the Southerners had gained their independence from Lincoln&rsquo;s Union?  The North would&rsquo;ve licked its wounds and perhaps compensated by conquering teritory later on in Canada. The South probably would&rsquo;ve annexed Cuba and the northern Mexican states (this before the HUGE population increase in Mexico after 1910). Perhaps the North would have stayed out of WWI and there might not have been a WII and the horrors that slaughter brought. In any event we would today have something of a &#8220;buffer state&#8221; between us and Mexico - the South! You don&rsquo;t think the Southerners would&rsquo;ve tolerated waves of illegal Mexican aliens etc. to invade their hard fought for C.S.A. do you?  In numerous ways I wish the South had won. Perhaps we wouldn&rsquo;t have the intolerable illegal alien situation of today! At the very least we would have some form of American nation that was still governed by the Constitution as the Founders intended, instead of the Federal, freedom-destroying Octopus we have today! </p>

		<p>CNN lost approximately half its viewers in the last year, in spite of attention-getting news events like the congressional battle over Obamacare and the earthquake in Haiti.  With folks like Martin writing this drivel for CNN, it&rsquo;s easy to see why.</p>
