			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Silver, Yahoo Sports, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen Toby Gerhart carry the football, you&rsquo;re well aware that the former Stanford halfback and Heisman Trophy runner-up is about as subtle as Iron Man. It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, that as the NFL draft approaches, the player one AFC front-office executive described as &#8220;a bowling ball with butter knives&#8221; is hell-bent on obliterating the perception that he lacks the athleticism to succeed in the pros.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m just a running back who tries to do what he can to win games and score touchdowns, but people have their opinions, and it&rsquo;s kind of frustrating,&#8221; Gerhart said earlier this month between bites of pizza. &#8220;People say, &#8216;He&rsquo;s slow,&rsquo; or &#8216;He&rsquo;s not going to be able to break tackles at the next level.&rsquo; In college I went up against players like [USC&rsquo;s] Brian Cushing and Clay Matthews  &mdash;  guys who ended up making the Pro Bowl [as NFL rookies]  &mdash;  and I ran through their tackles. It&rsquo;s too bad people look at you all weird because of a stereotype.&#8221;</p>
<p>When NFL scouts look at Gerhart, they see a 6-foot, 231-pound power back who ran for 1,871 yards and 27 touchdowns last season, getting edged out by Alabama&rsquo;s Mark Ingram in the closest Heisman vote in history. When they look at Gerhart&rsquo;s numbers from the NFL scouting combine, they see that he ran a 4.50-second 40-yard dash and registered a 38-inch vertical leap, both impressive numbers for a player his size.</p>
<p>Yet they also see a white guy trying to make it in the league as a feature back, something that has become increasingly rare in this era. Peyton Hillis, now with the Cleveland Browns, led the Denver Broncos in rushing yards in 2008, but was limited to just 54 last season in part because of 2009 draft pick Knowshon Moreno&rsquo;s addition.</p>
<p>Race shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, of course, but Gerhart can&rsquo;t help but believe that it has colored the opinions of at least some potential employers.</p>
<p>&#8220;One team I interviewed with asked me about being a white running back,&#8221; Gerhart says. &#8220;They asked if it made me feel entitled, or like I felt I was a poster child for white running backs. I said, &#8216;No, I&rsquo;m just out there playing ball. I don&rsquo;t think about that.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t really know what to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>One longtime NFL scout insisted that Gerhart&rsquo;s skin color will likely prevent the Pac-10&rsquo;s offensive player of the year from being drafted in Thursday&rsquo;s first round.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m waiting on the following:</p>
<p>* The NFL to pour a lot of money to develop white feature running backs.  (They have done this in the past to develop black QBs.)</p>
<p>* What ESPN will do to one of their talking heads who would say that the team that drafted Gerhart in the first round is only doing it because of &#8220;social concern,&#8221; i.e. white racism.  (Hint:  Rush Limbaugh and Donovan McNabb)</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s good.  If he is restricted because of the curse of his White Race Skin Color, then he will become a good WN recruit.  Even the race conversation will make him sensitive to our White Concerns. The worse things go for him, the better they get for us, which is a universal maxim regarding occassions when Whites Who Are Deligitimized because of Their Race.</p>

		<p>I think Toby Gerhart might just be the breakthrough young White RB. He&rsquo;s got everything it takes to be a top notch back in the nfl. all he needs is to get on the right team with the right coach to give him his shot. If he&rsquo;s successful, then they floodgates will be open to White RBs.</p>

		<p> Toby Gerhart appears to be on target to be the latest White athlete victimized by &#8220;reserve racism&#8221; on the part of professional athletic scouts and coaches. The mantra goes like this: &#8220;He&rsquo;s White, so he can&rsquo;t possibly be a good athlete. If he&rsquo;s a DECENT (not good) athlete, he&rsquo;s slow afoot and can&rsquo;t jump. If he&rsquo;s a smart athlete, we don&rsquo;t dare say so for fear of being accused of implying that black athletes are NOT smart.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m betting there are oodles of white football players and basketball players who are passed over when they could probably contribute greatly to a team.</p>
<p>Because the situation is so unfair is why I stopped watching spectator sports 15 years ago.</p>
<p>I would urge everyubody to do the same.  The only way we&rsquo;re going to get white players on these teams is to refuse to watch these all black boring displays..  When their receipts go down, they&rsquo;ll come looking for us.</p>

		<p>The anti-white crowd running the media, the marxists, the neocons, whatever you want to call these haters, are the ones who built up most of the anti-white stereotypes in sports. While different groups tend to have, on average, different levels of talent in certain areas. the red-diaper grandkids were hell bent on using their media, using sports and entertainment, as some of their key tools to undermine white confidence. This is no secret to anyone who spends a little time doing some research. These same people are doing all they can now to &#8216;correct&rsquo; the horrible situation in boxing with most champs being white from 150 lbs on up, and in MMA (mixed martial arts) where whites dominate. The behind the scenes talk about the UFC is that if the organization can provide more non-white fighters and champs, protect some non-white fighters as it has been doing, then it will be able to get a network TV contract. Sounds like fiction, but that&rsquo;s the talk. Wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it for a minute. </p>

		<p>Blacks always claim they are the ones that have to &#8220;work harder&#8221; to overcome &#8220;stereotypes&#8221; to achieve in America. Well, this white guy (and I have seen him play) will have to &#8220;overcome&#8221; to prove all that stuff is garbage and just the opposite. At 6 foot and 230 lbs, no doubt, he will be relegated to a blocking fullback type player if he is to make it in the NFL. But hell, that ain&rsquo;t all bad. Btw, why would some idiotic team rep ask this guy if he felt &#8220;entitled&#8221; to be a RB in the NFL because he&rsquo;s &#8220;white&#8221;? Gerhardt ought to name names and teams and expose these pukes. You better bet if this type of stuff happened to a black player he would have no qualms about spilling the beans and the press would be all over it. Maybe white players don&rsquo;t do it because they know the press don&rsquo;t care about them. And if an NFL scout is openly admitting that this guys skin color will keep him from being a first round pick why is there not and investigation into this?</p>

<p>In fact, the anti-white mindset has filtered down to big-time college football, no doubt due to the large number of former NFL coaches there. Outstanding white high school RBs, WRs, safeties and cornerbacks are routinely forced to become fullbacks, tight ends or linemen in these programs to keep their old positions reserved for blacks. Many others are simply ignored altogether and forced to play in Division II or III, where their chances of ever being drafted are almost zero.</p>
<p>We all know how black Division I football &amp; basketball have become. It would be interesting to see the racial demographics of the smaller schools.</p>

<p>You didn&rsquo;t see anywhere close to that level of mockery when Gerry Cooney beat Norton in double quick time. In the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s it was common for comedians to make fun of terrible white heavyweights, you don&rsquo;t see that at all today.</p>

		<p>I know of one white NFL player who is in his 5th or 6th season who is still in the league strictly for his brains and being an on the field leader.  At least that&rsquo;s what they say.  I think he&rsquo;s still in the league because of his talent, speed, guts, determination, very high intelligence, and superior mental toughness.  He was not recruited out of his tiny HS.  He walked on to a very respectable D1 college and became an All-American which led to him being only a non-drafted free agent.  Once again, he&rsquo;s proved himself worthy by staying in the league all these years as a starter and team leader.  If he was black and had all of these attributes he would have been highly recruited by multiple D1 colleges and been drafted high.  Stereotypes have made it difficult for him all the way and he continues to excel.</p>
<p>Each time he has a noteworthy performance articles always bring up his lack of size, speed, being from an area unknown as a football powerhouse, etc.  All of this is of course is code for &#8220;slow white boy, what chu doin&rsquo; here?&#8221; </p>
<p>I hope Gerhart is a type of modern day Riggins, bashing people in the mouth, stepping over their battered carcass, and sprinting to the goal line.  Lets all hope!</p>
<p>P.S.  My work internet blocks/filters castefootball.us.  Huh imagine that. </p>

		<p>Gerhart is the best RB in the draft yet will slip to the second round because of his skin color.</p>
<p>The guy is 237 lbs and runs a 4.5 40! Who wouldn&rsquo;t want that? Toby is bigger and faster than Jerome Bettis and Stephen Jackson and he is falling to the second round!</p>
<p>There is no hope for the NFL or the NBA. If you&rsquo;re not black you are not allowed in many positions.</p>

		<p>So blacks are always complaining they have to work 10 times as hard because they&rsquo;re black (though they can&rsquo;t prove this, we all have to just swallow it without question), yet they are given high positions and money and assistance just because of their skin color.  No employer wants to hire blacks if they can help it.  Most can&rsquo;t perform as well as the whites do and their complaints of racism cost the companies millions of dollars.  Don&rsquo;t hire blacks, you&rsquo;re a racist and will get sued.  Hire blacks, and you&rsquo;ll get accused of racism and get sued.  You just can&rsquo;t win with blacks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the filter for your work computer&rsquo;s internet connection was created by the Pro-Defamation League (ADL).  Even the SPLC opposes web censorship; mainly because they&rsquo;re in competition with the ADL for donations, they have to differentiate themselves with the ADL and the rest of the paranoia-industrial complex somehow.

		<p>Surprise surprise.  Gerhart wasn&rsquo;t taken in the first round of the draft last night.  I know not every team drafting in the first round this year needed a RB, but I know there was at least one taken.  IMHO, if he were black, he would have been taken somewhere in the second half of the first round, if not higher.  </p>

		<p>It looks like I was somewhat correct about Gerhart getting his chance. He was taken in the 3rd round by the Minnesota Vikings, which is not bad at all.<br>
In fact, he was the 51st pick overall, and the 5th running back taken. This is his chance, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t blow it.</p>
