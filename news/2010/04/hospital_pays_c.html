<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/31/hospital-pays-compensation-racism-death">Hospital Pays Compensation Over &#8216;Racism&rsquo; Death</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen McVeigh, Guardian (London), March 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A journalist who fought a decade-long legal battle with a Hong Kong hospital over the death of his wife has been awarded a &#8220;substantial sum&#8221; in compensation.</p>
<p>Martin Jacques, author of When China Rules the World and a Guardian columnist, has always maintained that his wife, Harinder Veriah, 33, an Indian-Malaysian, died after suffering negligence brought on by racism. Their son, Ravi, was 16 months old when she died.</p>
<p>Veriah died in the Ruttonjee hospital on 2 January 2000 after an epileptic seizure. The night before, she had complained to Jacques about her poor treatment, saying she was at the &#8220;bottom of the pile&#8221; because of the colour of her skin. Her words, repeated by Jacques at her inquest, struck a chord with many among Hong Kong&rsquo;s ethnic communities. They prompted a campaign about racism in the country and culminated in its first anti-racism laws in 2008.</p>
<p>Today, speaking in Hong Kong, Jacques said he felt vindicated by the settlement, which came on the eve of a high court action against Hong Kong Hospital Authority, after an &#8220;aggressive and bloody-minded&#8221; battle.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The hospital authority settling is basically admitting that Hari&rsquo;s treatment was indefensible. I fought to get hospital records and I started to get a picture of what happened and the picture was that her treatment was outrageous. There&rsquo;s absolutely no reason why someone should die from epilepsy. Hari&rsquo;s death was utterly unnecessary and utterly avoidable. I have always believed that if Hari had been white or Chinese she would still be alive today. The trouble is, after a death like that you&rsquo;re never the same person. I&rsquo;ve learned to handle it, but the pain never goes away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frances Swaine of lawyers Leigh Day welcomed the announcement of the settlement after what she described as an &#8220;arduous and demanding&#8221; case. &#8220;I am relieved that this settlement means that Martin and his son Ravi can now be released from the pressures that accompany any court case and move on in their lives,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Veriah, a lawyer who worked for Lovells in Hong Kong, was admitted to Ruttonjee hospital after suffering a grand mal epileptic fit on the first day of the millennium, after a celebratory night out.</p>
<p>Jacques became worried for her after she told him of the racism she believed was behind her poor treatment there and he was unable to get any useful information from the duty doctor. When he received a call from a nurse the next morning to say that Veriah had suffered another fit, he was at her bedside within 10 minutes. There was no sign of a doctor, who had prescribed Valium, he said. Veriah never regained consciousness and died shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>At the initial inquest into her death, in November 2000 in Hong Kong, the coroner recorded a verdict of death from natural causes, saying that epilepsy sometimes claimed otherwise healthy young adults.</p>
<p>Jacques eventually managed to get hold of her hospital records. What he read convinced him that Veriah had suffered a respiratory depression  &mdash;  a decline in oxygen  &mdash;  after being given a sedative and that she was not monitored or treated properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Valium is a sedative which can depress breathing. Her oxygen levels were falling even although she appeared to be breathing normally  &mdash;  and they failed to monitor her properly,&#8221; said Jacques.</p>
<p>In 2002, at the London inquest into her death, the court heard from two pathologists, one from Hong Kong and one from Britain, who could not find anything wrong with Veriah. One theory was that she may have had a reaction to the Valium. Professor Joe Collier of St George&rsquo;s hospital, Tooting, said a drug that could reverse the effects of Valium was not given.</p>
<p>The St Pancras coroner, Dr Stephen Chan, recording an open verdict, said: &#8220;There is a question to be addressed as to the level of care in those last 20 minutes and the management and level of care given .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the brief stay in hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacques, who has been &#8220;very damaged&#8221; by what happened to his wife, said: &#8220;No one can compensate for Hari&rsquo;s death but justice does matter. It is tragic that care for those who are ill can be prejudiced by their colour. But as Hari found in 14 months in Hong Kong, racism is endemic to Hong Kong society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Racism in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Harinder Veriah&rsquo;s death helped to expose an ugly truth in Hong Kong: that racism is a serious problem. In its coverage of the case, a report in the Asian Wall Street Journal entitled &#8220;Hong Kong&rsquo;s big dirty little secret&#8221; acknowledged that racism was so ingrained that derogatory terms for ethnic minorities such as gwei lo (&#8220;ghost people&#8221;) for whites and hak gwai or (&#8220;black ghost&#8221;) for blacks were barely noticed. In 2008 the Hong Kong government introduced an anti-racism bill that marked a milestone in the relationship between the predominantly Chinese population and its minority citizens.<br>

<p>No so Indian Indians or Blacks or Browns from the terrible way I and other Whites have been mistreated by them in hospitals, no matter how polite we are or how much we grovel to them.<br>

		<p>I always wonder at liberal type people when I tell them how prejudiced Orientals are. They have no idea of the world for the most part. I thought Oriental prejudice against outsiders was a known factor. It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>

		<p>Firstly,  the Chinese can&rsquo;t practice medicine worth a damn. They are a dangerous joke. Secondly, any fool with real world experience knows that, Chinese  (and Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese, etc.,)are virulently racist by ANY liberal standard. Liberals deserve to be left to the caring hands of the Chinese. Thanks to neocons and multicult freaks, they will indeed!<br>
Enjoy, libtards!</p>

<p>Not just Hong Kong.  Not just China.  It&rsquo;s everywhere.<br>
It seems to be just human nature.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one more reason why each race and ethnic group should have its own space on this planet. And it&rsquo;s proof that multi-racialism is an idealistic fantasy that&rsquo;s unworkable and completely unnatural.</p>

		<p>@Tom, you&rsquo;re spot on.  Asians are shameless racists; the worst I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  A Korean guy I worked with described the pecking order for him, starting with &#8220;true&#8221; Asians; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.  Then the order followed more-or-less the same as yours and mine might, and at the very bottom were the groups that I would wrongly categorize as Asians, like Vietnamese and Filipinos.  He hated those groups and had all sorts of derogatory names for them that are against the posting rules on Amren.<br>

		<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, the Orientals do not give any black person the time of day, or hire them or associate with them at all.  You will see a very rare young oriental girl with a black boy, probably to spite the father, but other than that, those two groups lead completely independent existences.  </p>
<p>Orientals only rent out to other orientals, even in big apartment buildings, and this is a well known fact in my parts.  (They won&rsquo;t rent to whites either.)  I wonder where all the multicultural/social justice people are on this?  Another thing we need to call them out on so they leave us dwindling whites alone.</p>

		<p>I have been to Hong Kong a few times and the people couldn&rsquo;t be nicer, from what I&rsquo;ve found.  But I do know, that in most Asian cultures, there is a prejudice against darker skin.  The lighter, the better, and women especially go to extremes to avoid the sun.  The reasoning is that dark skin means a laborer, someone who has to work outdoors in the sun.  Light skin means higher up on the social ladder, one who has money and doesn&rsquo;t need to labor.  This almost seemed to me to be ingrained in them.</p>
<p>On another note, a very odd thing happened the last time I was there.  An very old man was coming out of a building, walking with a cane, and as he came out, he slipped and fell.  I went up to him and helped him back to his feet, then went a grabbed his cap, which had blown down the street a bit.  What was odd was that many people were walking by him, but no one else offered to help, not even to pick up his cap. Not really sure why.</p>

		<p>Asian racism is nothing new to anyone but brainwashed liberals who think only whites can be racist.  Aside from blacks, asians are literally the most racist people I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.  They&rsquo;re not afraid to show it either.</p>
<p>I take a small amount of comfort in the fact that if whites do cease to exist in the next few centuries(highly unlikely, but never rule anything out - realizing you can indeed lose is the first step to avoiding it), the darker races will quickly realize just how good they had it when asians take their spot as #1 on the racial food chain. </p>

		<p>It is hard for me to feel sorry for a race traitor.  No one should die because of there ethnicity but I just do not have it in me anymore to feel bad for one who betrays his own.</p>
<p>He is the founder of &#8220;Marxism Today&#8221; and dedicated to the destruction of both his fellow Englishman and the European race.  He is an evil man and sometimes justice is served in this lifetime.  Although I doubt that losing his wife has made him sympathetic to those of us loosing our nations and least he has suffered a little in this life time, though not nearly enough.</p>
<p>I have strong feeling against Marxists.  When I was a child, even into the 1960s, my family sent &#8220;care&#8221; packages to Hungary to help out the family there.  Though my first generation grandparents and second generation parents were WORKING poor we were much better off than the family still behind the Iron Curtain after the revolution of 1956.  </p>
<p>I have Cuban friends who do the same thing today - send care packages to relatives in Cuba.  Mostly in the form of clothes that are desperately needed or can be used to trade for other commodities.</p>
<p>When will the fools wake up?  Marxism is pure evil.  Marxists are pure evil.  If I feel no Christian Charity towards a man who would destroy not only his people but my people, the great American people, perhaps you can have sympathy for me.</p>

		<p>      The Liberals&rsquo; refusal to recognize Asian racism might be indicative of something very strange: that they don&rsquo;t really care about the Blacks and Browns at all. The Blacks might just be the instruments for retribution and punishment - for Whites. And for the most part, other Whites, ones who aren&rsquo;t true belivers in the Liberal Faith.</p>

<p>This is quite normal, particularly on the mainland. I remember my first week in Shanghai while I was in a taxi I saw someone fall off a motorbike (not at high speed), and was lying there with passers-by looking on but not one person went to see if he was ok. From then on I saw that sort of thing many times. I have heard the theory that it&rsquo;s a Confucian thing that if you help someone you&rsquo;re then responsible for them so nobody wants to. Either way I think it&rsquo;s a reflection on their culture in general, ie look after your own family (if it was a relative/friend/colleague they would immediately help) but care little for your fellow countrymen - ironic for a country with a lot of open displays of nationalism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though I think this selfishness is really starting to catch on in western society too, as our common culture and the bond we once had is broken down. The &#8216;every man for himself&rsquo; attitude is rife.</p>

<p>For Hong Kong that seems a little unusual, (although believable). I have found Hong Kong people quite quick to help in most circumstances. Same goes for Singaporeans.</p>
<p>The situation is different in mainland China unfortunately. Although during the Mao years, and a few years after his death people were generally pretty good in this respect - giving up their seats for the elderly, looking out for the common good.</p>
<p>Of course it is terrible there now - but hopefully just a phase they are passing through. </p>
<p>After all it is less than a century ago, that whites were forcing their own kids into factories, forcing them to slave for long hours at a pittance. China is going through that phase now, while abuses can be heavily punished under law, things can be pretty difficult to control - especially in far flung provinces.<br>
