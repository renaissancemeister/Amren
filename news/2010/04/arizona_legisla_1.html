<h1><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/04/30/arizona-legislature-passes-banning-ethnic-studies-programs/">Arizona Legislature Passes Bill Banning Ethnic Studies Programs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FOXNews, April 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After making national headlines for a new law on illegal immigrants, the Arizona Legislature passed a bill Thursday that would ban ethnic studies programs in the state that critics say currently advocate separatism and racial preferences.</p>
<p>The bill, which passed 32-26 in the state House, had been approved by the Senate a day earlier. It now goes to Gov. Jan Brewer for her signature.</p>
<p>The new bill would make it illegal for a school district to teach any courses that promote the overthrow of the U.S. government, promote resentment of a particular race or class of people, are designed primarily for students of a particular ethnic group or &#8220;advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill stipulates that courses can continue to be taught for Native American pupils in compliance with federal law and does not prohibit English as a second language classes. It also does not prohibit the teaching of the Holocaust or other cases of genocide.</p>
<p>Schools that fail to abide by the law would have state funds withheld.</p>

<p>Passing by a narrow margin of 32-26 makes me wonder who could be against a bill like this.</p>
<p>Probably it&rsquo;s the mestizos, because they just love learning to hate the US and its white citizens.</p>
<p>Having to pass a bill like this before sedition can be curtailed is just another piece of evidence that the empire is in serious trouble.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;After making national headlines for a new law on illegal immigrants, the Arizona Legislature passed a bill Thursday that would ban ethnic studies programs in the state that critics say currently advocate separatism and racial preferences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s state political leaders (I am assuming the vast majority of which are Republicans,) seem to have finally come realize who their true enemies are. These being nonwhites and the multicultural traitors who &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; for them. As of 2008, White persons not Hispanic were only 58.4% of the population of Arizona, according to the US Census Bureau&rsquo;s best estimates. See this link:</p>
<p>https://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04000.html</p>
<p>58.4% would be well below the 75% to 70% white majority baseline needed, in any given geographical area, to maintain strong socioeconomic and political stability, within previously expected and acceptable standards when the white majority was overwhelming (i.e., the 80% or greater range.)  We can even see this in the USA as a whole, now that we have sunk to at best a white majority of 65%. </p>
<p>Falling below the 75% to 70% white majority baseline, indicates that once &ldquo;fashionably tolerable&rdquo; notions of allowing nonwhites to act out in childishly delinquent or even collectively seditious manners of entitled &ldquo;self-expression,&rdquo; are no longer feasible for either themselves or the white majority they wish to feed and breed off of. </p>
<p>Here in this article and the legislative action of Arizona&rsquo;s political leadership, as described in it, we find a rational solution to the problem. Take away the sting of the invaders and their ability to unnaturally reproduce, and the consumptive process can be arrested. This includes, but is not limited to, the federal exacerbations of these terminally &ldquo;tolerant&rdquo; issues. </p>
<p>For example, how can local laws defending against the overthrow of the U.S. government by nonwhites be seen as &ldquo;racist.&rdquo; It is a high form of treason and terrorism by such groups as La Raza, and the states are simply defending the US Constitution in eradicating them. </p>
<p>Just something to think about!</p>

		<p>As a former educator, can I tell you how much I LOVE this law???  I am ecstatic to read about this.  I well remember when I was a student at a CA university that was still in the process of building new buildings.  They had just completed the admin bldg, and two of the &#8220;ethnic studies&#8221; depts. were to be housed in that lovely new building.  Within 6 weeks the bathrooms were covered in graffiti, the halls looked like Little Tijuana, and it became dangerous to stray out of the admin area if you were not one of the two ethnicities (guess which two).  The only people who went to these &#8220;ethnic&#8221; majors were the ones who were unable to make it anywhere else.  These idiots barely made it thru the required semesters of hard science (9 units of biology, chemistry, or physics).  Some didn&rsquo;t make it at all.  But boy were they ever present in the ethnic areas, and happy to threaten any whites in &#8220;their&#8221; territory.  Now, that was a long time ago, and by now those departments probably would need to be sandblasted in order to clean the place up.  I pray that we in CA follow AZ&rsquo;s lead in this.  That ethnic stuff has no place in any school.</p>

		<p>Let me play devil&rsquo;s advocate for a moment here.  Everyone is excited about legislation like this and the immigration law but no one seems to be entertaining the idea that this is just more dangerous legislation that could be turned against us very easily.</p>
<p>One of the more well-known Jefferson quotes is the one about the tree of liberty needing refreshment from time to time with its natural manure, which is the blood of patriots.  It&rsquo;s woven into our national fabric to be skeptical and untrusting of government.  A number of our forefathers expressly stated that we should topple the government if it becomes oppressive or ineffective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many here who are themselves advocates of separatism.  This law would just make it easier to silence those who chafe against an increasingly intrusive government.  I&rsquo;d rather see protections offered for white students with the courage to face down this ethnic studies nonsense in debate.  People who actually have a leg to stand on shouldn&rsquo;t fear being given a little shove, and the fact that they are so touchy and shy of open forums for ideas is telling.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad they are getting rid of ethnic studies, and thankfully in my time at University I never came across or saw those courses. However, women studies courses were all the rage, and I really do wish that those are the next to be dismantled. All they are, is anti-male stories to make men feel bad, and women feel enraged.</p>

		<p>Yeah, right on! Now were really talking when it comes to eliminating the non-essentials, that schools across the nation have been spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers dollars on for years. Any ruthless and final elimination of leftist propaganda or activity in the American halls of learning is always welcome.</p>

		<p>This could backfire. We think of Western Civilization as being general knowledge but it can be considered as ethnic specific. Western literature, philosophy, history, art, and even science, can be removed from schools. Even worse, all efforts to come up with non-ethnic forms of knowledge and culture have failed. Think of the failure of communism in Russia where they tried to develop a new basis for knowledge and culture. Something has to be taught to youth and there will be terrific battles over who gets to decide. This is one of the reasons I argue for white identity and solidarity; we need the strength to get our fair share.</p>

<p>Your point is taken, however, if they are not allowing explicit advocacy for whites, by whites, then it is better to disallow any advocacy/ethnic study for any group.  </p>
<p>End the absurd double standard when it comes to any show of ethnic/racial pride.  Do away with it for all, or allow it for all.  Looks like at least in Arizona, that people are starting to wake up.</p>

		<p>8  &mdash;  white advocate - Canada :  Actually what the USSR attempted to do under Stalin was &#8220;Russifie&#8221; the population..  Stalin, a native Georgian, knew that a multicultural society wouldn&rsquo;t work.  That was one of the things that made the Russian Empire vulnerable to the Bolsheviks.  His plan was to make the entire nation Russian speaking, and culturally Russian, except that he also wanted everyone to be an atheist.  They moved Russians into various other republics to help accomplish that goal.  Forced reeducation doesn&rsquo;t really work and the USSR collapsed.</p>
<p>The American melting pot worked because we had periods of European immigration followed by very little immigration.  The European immigrants, of course, were not officially accommodated by the state and federal governments.  The periods of little immigration allowed us to digest the newcomers, so to speak.  There was also a certain pride in becoming American that does not exist today.  And of course the Europeans being white and having a great deal of shared culture and traditions tended to meld together more easily.  Many Europeans even had much in the way of a shared history due to the far-flung size of the Roman, Holy Roman, Austrian and Russian empires.</p>
<p>The American elite have promoted, since 1965, a non-unified United States.  The American Elites have also protected and encouraged a third world invasion along with non-assimilation.  If Puerto Rico achieves statehood the republic is done.  Any pretense of a two party political system will be over.  We will be officially a Spanish speaking nation.  We will be a part of third world Latin America by 2020 rather than 2050.</p>
<p>And let me be clear, this will NOT be Puerto Rico&rsquo;s fault.  We should have Americanized them or set them free a long time ago.  In fact most Puerto Ricans are happy with commonwealth status.  The up coming election is a sham in the best communist tradition.  The ballot choices are fixed.  It is truly sad what this country has sunk to.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s laws are two little, too late.  At best we can only hope for a homeland somewhere.<br>

		<p>Arizona is to be commended for yet another step that reduces the fragmentation and balkanization of our country.  We are all citizen kings of one republic, or we are condemned to intercine strife. There are undoubtedly contributions to American culture made by various groups, some more than others, but we need to all be Americans. This is why illegal immigration is a challenge to a Republican form of government, for it creates a class of residents who are not citizens.  Granting these a path to citizenship, or validating their separate status, is a threat to republican institutions.  </p>

<p>So much good news out of Arizona lately! Everyone should plan to vacation there this year   &mdash;   especially since left-wing nuts from places like San FranCrisco are promising NOT to visit AZ! It would be nice to know you&rsquo;re spend your white tourist dollars in a state that doesn&rsquo;t hate white people. </p>
<p>Myself, I don&rsquo;t fare particularly well under 120F desert heat   &mdash;   but it would be worth enduring it just to live in a place where Americans aren&rsquo;t afraid of acting like Americans. <br>

<p>Absolutely correct! this is exactly what happened to the Roman Empire. Our military contains a larger percentage of soldiers now that have allegiance to countries other than the U.S. than did Rome in 375AD shortly before their demise. Personally, I count the fall of the Roman Empire from the time of the creation of the Western Emperor and the Eastern Emperor&hellip;just as is gonna happen in the U.S. but there will be 3.</p>

		<p>12  &mdash;  white advocate - Canada:  interesting. But I really don&rsquo;t think our &#8220;Trotskys&#8221; are trying to make a &#8220;new man&#8221; so much as they are trying to genocide us out of existence, or at least out of power.  Our leaders don&rsquo;t promote a &#8220;single American man&#8221; identity but rather a fragmented identity.  The obvious racists like the Obamas, Sharpton, Farrakhan, etc. want us out of the way.  The self-absorbed &#8220;elites&#8221; like the Kennedys, Bushs, Robert Reich, the Clintons, etc. want a Mexican-style system with them at the top and almost everyone else at the bottom.  The Hispanic advocates want to take over, pure and simple, and extract revenge on the gringo for all their own failures.</p>
<p>Remember, there are always a small number of people who do well during chaotic times: Robert Mugabe and Carlos Slim for example.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s new laws are a start at waking up some small number of white people.  Too late to save the country but perhaps early enough to save some of our people.</p>

<p>A Soviet poem from that article on the &#8220;New Soviet Man&#8221;:</p>
<p>    Who needs a &#8220;1&#8221;?<br>
    The voice of a &#8220;1&#8221;<br>
    is thinner than a squeak.<br>
    Who will hear it?<br>
        Only the wife&hellip;<br>
    A &#8220;1&#8221; is nonsense.<br>
    A &#8220;1&#8221; is zero.</p>
<p>Soviet officialdom may never have required people to say that two and two makes five (ala Orwell), but they did say that one equals zero.<br>

<p>The central government-and the elites that control it-has been our enemy for a long time, and no election will change that fact. The  Permanent Government  arrogates to itself  final veto power over anything done by the States. Non-elite whites have no future within the existing regime, so it&rsquo;s an irrelevancy to worry about &#8220;dangerous legislation.&#8221; It&rsquo;s kind of like Jews in 1939 Germany worrying about &#8220;dangerous legislation&#8221; being passed by the Nazis. </p>
