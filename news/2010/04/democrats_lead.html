<p>Calls grew across the US today for a boycott of Arizona over its new law giving the police the most draconian powers in the country to deal with illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Democratic members of Congress, religious leaders and leftwing activists urged a boycott of hotels, convention centres and other economic targets in the state. At least one nationwide group has responded by cancelling a convention planned for the autumn. Scores of lorry drivers were reported in the US media to have threatened to stop carrying loads to and from the state.</p>
<p>The calls are being made spontaneously by individuals and an array of groups, but leftwing activists predict they will soon coalesce into a single campaign.</p>
<p>The bill, signed into law on Friday, gives police the right to stop anyone &#8220;if reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the US&#8221;. It has polarised opinion across the US, creating a clear divide between Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>In a sign of the passions aroused, cleaning crews were called to the state legislative building this morning to clear swastikas daubed on it overnight.</p>
<p>Opponents of the legislation say it will lead to victimisation of anyone who looks or sounds Latino. Supporters say the legislation is needed because the state can no longer cope with an estimated 450,000 illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Among those calling for a sweeping boycott was the San Francisco city attorney, Dennis Herrera, who urged city departments to look at contracts with Arizona that could be terminated.</p>
<p>Herrera said: &#8220;Arizona has charted an ominous legal course that puts extremist politics before public safety, and betrays our most deeply held American values.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that a similar boycott 20 years ago, which included the National Football League&rsquo;s decision to move the Super Bowl from the state, led to Arizona finally dropping its refusal to recognise to Martin Luther King Day.</p>
<p>A Democratic congressman from Arizona, Ra√∫l Grijalva, is also calling for an economic boycott against what he described as &#8220;unjust and racist&#8221; legislation that will damage Arizona&rsquo;s prestige and credibility. He was forced to close his office at the weekend after receiving two death threats.</p>
<p>At a rally on Sunday, Grijalva, one of the leading advocates in the US Congress of immigration reform that would offer a route to citizenship for illegal immigrants, called for President Barack Obama to use his executive powers to block the legislation.</p>
<p>Posters were created over the weekend supporting a boycott, including one by the Chicano writer and artist Harry Gamboa headed &#8220;Boycott Hate State Arizona&#8221;.</p>
<p>The sports editor of the leftwing publication the Nation, Dave Zirin, announced he would no longer write about the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. &#8220;For me, they do not exist. They will continue to not exist in my mind as long as the horribly named &#8216;Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighbourhoods Act&rsquo; remains law in Arizona,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>The board of governors of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, based in Washington, ordered its executive to move a convention planned for this autumn from Arizona. The association president, Bernie Wolfsdorf, said: &#8220;We cannot in good conscience spend association dollars in a state that dehumanises the people we represent and fight for.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rev Al Sharpton, an advocate of African-American rights, said in New York yesterday he would organise &#8220;freedom walkers&#8221;, just as the civil rights movement had organised freedom riders to board segregated buses in the 1960s. &#8220;We will go to Arizona when this bill goes into effect and walk the streets with people who refuse to give identification and force arrest,&#8221; Sharpton said.<br>

I need a good paying job, I will deliver stuff in my truck.  I will work for 1/2 of what those truckers demand.  </p>
<p>Arizona had to do this because no one wants to go to Arizona, its too dangerous.  If cops and armed ranchers are getting murdered how safe is it for tourests.</p>

		<p>What is Sharpton doing meddling in Arizona&rsquo;s laws that don&rsquo;t affect him???  Well, he&rsquo;s getting more publicity, for one thing, and that&rsquo;s always good for him.  I think, though, that people need to butt out of Arizona&rsquo;s situation - AZ&rsquo;ns are doing what they need to do for the good of their state.  ILLEGALS are ILLEGAL - what is so hard to get about that?  Whatever is illegal needs to be caught and the penalties of the law applied.  Mexicans are not above the law, despite what that pedophile-loving Cardinal Mahony says about it (he&rsquo;s leaving soon anyway, thank God).  I hope to God Arizonans stand their ground.  They should also look at what the Australian Prime Minister just said to Muslims and other discontented foreigners in his country - i.e., like it or leave it, either shut up or get out.  Now that&rsquo;s what I call effective policy!!</p>

		<p>Not a big surprise.  Democrats, who fail to even get a rudimentary grasp on the meaning of the Constitution are upset.  The words illegal mean law breaker, the 10th Amendment gives the states the right to say up yours to the Fed for not doing anything.  Arizona will prosper immensely for this decision, if anything for simply reducing the burden on public services as well as less demand on the sewer and sanitary water system and the electrical grid.  Jobs will be available for those caught in the downturn.  Heck if it wasn&rsquo;t like living in an oven I&rsquo;d move down there in a year or two.  The streets will be safer, crime will go down and perhaps there will be a stronger sense of responsibility and dedication against illegals.  My hats off to the governor and those that supported this common sense legislation.</p>

<p>Like the black boycott of S.C. it will affect nothing and go no where.  Even if it were effective it would serve only to harm the lower classes, which would be legal and illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m looking for other states to enact the same kind of legislation, especially Georgia and maybe Florida. </p>
<p>But, like me, do you wonder why Arizona was able to pass such a law when in prior years, when it was REALLY needed, nothing could get done?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s either intelligence pointing to the possibility of another terrorist attack from sleeper cells that sneaked across the border that the politicians are privvy to, or this economic catatrophe has DEMANDED that actions be taken to get illegals off the social benefit rolls, because Arizona is in dire danger of going the exact same way as California.</p>
<p>The news sites every day now are reporting on various states and locales that are in such budget shortfalls they&rsquo;re having to layoff their police.  And some are even talking about being unable to keep their committments of pensions to their police and firemen and other civil service workers.</p>
<p>Either way whatever the reasons might be, it&rsquo;s apparent this bill was a last desperate act by the politicians of that state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get worse.  </p>

<p>Yeah, sure, truck drivers will refuse to deliver goods their employers want delivered to Arizona.  That should get them fired in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about as believable as claiming liberal Democrats will vote Republican in the next election.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to see a well fed fellow like Al Sharpton lead a parade in Arizona in August.  As one poster said, it&rsquo;s a dry heat, but that only means that it feels cooler in the shade.  But marching in the sun on the asphalt?  More likely Big Al is expecting four Mexicans to carry him in an air conditioned sedan chair.  Make that eight Mexicans.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Scores of lorry drivers &hellip;threatened to stop carrying loads to and from the state.&#8221;<br>
     1. &#8220;Scores?&#8221;  Like 40 or 60?  How many truckers does this fellow think we have in America?  Does the writer know anything about this country?  <br>
     2. Why in the world would American truck drivers give up pay for Mexicans?  I had thought that the Teamster&rsquo;s Union was one of the only labor organizations in this country that actually opposes flooding the country with cheap labor.<br>
     3. The City Attorney of San Francisco is squealing about &#8220;&hellip;deeply held American values&#8221;, but wants to break contracts with people who happen to live in Arizona? <br>
     4. This member of Congress, Raul Grijalva, thinks that the President of the U.S. has the legitimate power to overrule the acts of a state legislature?  Did he never take a civics class?  I mean in THIS country?  <br>
     5. A Red rag like The Nation, the ardent defender of the old USSR, has a sports editor?  It is very telling that he puts his political hissy fit ahead of doing his job, as if a baseball team had something to do with passing laws.  But I do love seeing these people, Sharpton, Herrera, Grijalva, Gamboa, Zirin, and Wolfsdorf, openly rise up against the will of the citizens.  Some of those Tea Party people will be drifting our way if this keeps up.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not buying the &#8220;truckers&rsquo; boycott&#8221; rubbish for one second.  A trucking firm that refuses deliveries to and from Arizona will simply lose business, and in today&rsquo;s weak economy, that is just, plain stupid.  Individual truckers working for these firms who refuse will simply end up being fired or assigned less work, which in today&rsquo;s weak economy is just plain stupid.  Finally, independant truckers who refuse will also lose work, which (you guessed it) in an economic slowdown like today&rsquo;s is just plain stupid.  </p>
<p>In happier economic times, the bleeding heart dingbats among the blue-collar professions have the luxury of allowing themselves to be tricked into &#8220;solidarity&#8221; with the criminal alien invaders who want to steal their jobs and work for less, but not today.</p>

		<p>I bet that its Mbambo&rsquo;s union goons that are telling the union drivers that no loads go to Arizona.  The independents will gladly go but they will now have to watch out for those goons who will try to stop the independents&hellip;by any means</p>

<p>Yeah, sure. Not likely. Company drivers will go wherever they&rsquo;re dispatched, and you&rsquo;re hard pressed to find an owner-op who will refuse paying work over something as stupid as this. Especially in this economy. And if one doesn&rsquo;t, another will always jump in and get paid.</p>
<p>Though I do not personally haul through AZ, this truck driver will be making Arizona tea his official drink of the road, starting immediately!</p>

		<p>Perhaps it has already been mentioned but there is a movement afoot to counter-boycott; i.e., to not patronize Mexican owned or themed restaurants and produce at the supermarket. <br>
Personally I am really tired of the overt anti-Americanism displayed by the Mexican immigrant. This problem is reminiscent of the French - Algerian crisis, which almost forced a collapse of the French government. Except, of course, in our case there is no Mediterranean Sea separating us from them.Also, and most ominously, Mexico is a &#8220;failed state&#8221;, on the verge of being a narco- state. Our troops fighting in Afghanistan are going to be used, mark my words.  Eventually the crises Mexican neo-nationalism is forcing on us will bring a severe backlash. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that many truckers would want to boycott Arizona because that state wishes to enforce immigration law.  Most work long hours for low pay, and can&rsquo;t afford to engage in political stunts just so that Pedro can stay in the country and take their trucking job at an even lower wage.  This sounds like another leftist lie.</p>
<p>If all the leftists really do boycott Arizona it will be the perfect state to host the next Amren conference.  There will be no antifa facists within a hundred miles.</p>
<p>Al Sharpton obviously wants to see more black people put out of work because employers prefer to hire cheap illegal aliens instead.  After all, unemployed blacks are angry blacks and angry blacks are Al&rsquo;s constituency.</p>

		<p>I have two weeks vacation coming up in May.  Up until now I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind where I wanted to spend it.  Now I do: Arizona.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scores of lorry drivers were reported in the US media to have threatened to stop carrying loads to and from the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh really?  Which &#8220;lorry drivers&#8221;?  I&rsquo;ll bet none of them were White.  I&rsquo;m also willing to bet economic realities will force a lot of the latino ones to continue going there, and many of the blacks won&rsquo;t care (though they won&rsquo;t admit it).</p>
<p>&#8220;Democratic members of Congress, religious leaders and leftwing activists urged a boycott of hotels, convention centres and other economic targets in the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>With enemies like that, who needs friends?</p>
<p>&#8220;Herrera said: &ldquo;Arizona has charted an ominous legal course that puts extremist politics before public safety, and betrays our most deeply held American values.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OUR most deeply held American values?  Is this guy for real?<br>

		<p>Even if a truckers&rsquo; boycott is somehow organized, the trains will continue to run.  A truckers&rsquo; boycott would doubtless leave Union Pacific and Burlington Northern/Santa Fe delighted.</p>
