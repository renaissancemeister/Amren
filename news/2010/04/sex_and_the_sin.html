<h1><a href="http://www.economist.com/world/united-states/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15867956">Sex and the Single Black Woman</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Economist, April 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>IMAGINE that the world consists of 20 men and 20 women, all of them heterosexual and in search of a mate. Since the numbers are even, everyone can find a partner. But what happens if you take away one man? You might not think this would make much difference. You would be wrong, argues Tim Harford, a British economist, in a book called &#8220;The Logic of Life&#8221;. With 20 women pursuing 19 men, one woman faces the prospect of spinsterhood. So she ups her game. Perhaps she dresses more seductively. Perhaps she makes an extra effort to be obliging. Somehow or other, she &#8220;steals&#8221; a man from one of her fellow women. That newly single woman then ups her game, too, to steal a man from someone else. A chain reaction ensues. Before long, every woman has to try harder, and every man can relax a little.</p>
<p>Real life is more complicated, of course, but this simple model illustrates an important truth. In the marriage market, numbers matter. And among African-Americans, the disparity is much worse than in Mr Harford&rsquo;s imaginary example. Between the ages of 20 and 29, one black man in nine is behind bars. For black women of the same age, the figure is about one in 150. For obvious reasons, convicts are excluded from the dating pool. And many women also steer clear of ex-cons, which makes a big difference when one young black man in three can expect to be locked up at some point.</p>
<p>Removing so many men from the marriage market has profound consequences. As incarceration rates exploded between 1970 and 2007, the proportion of US-born black women aged 30-44 who were married plunged from 62% to 33%. Why this happened is complex and furiously debated. The era of mass imprisonment began as traditional mores were already crumbling, following the sexual revolution of the 1960s and the invention of the contraceptive pill. It also coincided with greater opportunities for women in the workplace. These factors must surely have had something to do with the decline of marriage.</p>
<p>But jail is a big part of the problem, argue Kerwin Kofi Charles, now at the University of Chicago, and Ming Ching Luoh of National Taiwan University. They divided America up into geographical and racial &#8220;marriage markets&#8221;, to take account of the fact that most people marry someone of the same race who lives relatively close to them. Then, after crunching the census numbers, they found that a one percentage point increase in the male incarceration rate was associated with a 2.4-point reduction in the proportion of women who ever marry. Could it be, however, that mass incarceration is a symptom of increasing social dysfunction, and that it was this social dysfunction that caused marriage to wither? Probably not. For similar crimes, America imposes much harsher penalties than other rich countries. Mr Charles and Mr Luoh controlled for crime rates, as a proxy for social dysfunction, and found that it made no difference to their results. They concluded that &#8220;higher male imprisonment has lowered the likelihood that women marry&hellip;and caused a shift in the gains from marriage away from women and towards men.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Learning and earning</b></p>
<p>Similar problems afflict working-class whites, but they are more concentrated among blacks. Some 70% of black babies are born out of wedlock. The collapse of the traditional family has made black Americans far poorer and lonelier than they would otherwise have been. The least-educated black women suffer the most. In 2007 only 11% of US-born black women aged 30-44 without a high school diploma had a working spouse, according to the Pew Research Centre. Their college-educated sisters fare better, but are still affected by the sex imbalance. Because most seek husbands of the same race  &mdash;  96% of married black women are married to black men  &mdash;  they are ultimately fishing in the same pool.</p>
<p>Black women tend to stay in school longer than black men. Looking only at the non-incarcerated population, black women are 40% more likely to go to college. They are also more likely than white women to seek work. One reason why so many black women strive so hard is because they do not expect to split the household bills with a male provider. And the educational disparity creates its own tensions. If you are a college-educated black woman with a good job and you wish to marry a black man who is your socioeconomic equal, the odds are not good.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I was a catch,&#8221; sighs an attractive black female doctor at a hospital in Washington, DC. Black men with good jobs know they are &#8220;a hot commodity&#8221;, she observes. When there are six women chasing one man, &#8220;It&rsquo;s like, what are you going to do extra, to get his attention?&#8221; Some women offer sex on the first date, she says, which makes life harder for those who prefer to combine romance with commitment. She complains about a recent boyfriend, an electrician whom she had been dating for about six months, whose phone started ringing late at night. It turned out to be his other girlfriend. Pressed, he said he didn&rsquo;t realise the relationship was meant to be exclusive.</p>
<p>The skewed sex ratio &#8220;puts black women in an awful spot,&#8221; says Audrey Chapman, a relationship counsellor and the author of several books with titles such as &#8220;Getting Good Loving&#8221;. Her advice to single black women is pragmatic: love yourself, communicate better and so on. She says that many black men and women, having been brought up by single mothers, are unsure what role a man should play in the home. The women expect to be in charge; the men sometimes resent this. Nisa Muhammad of the Wedded Bliss Foundation, a pro-marriage group, urges her college-educated sisters to consider marrying honourable blue-collar workers, such as the postman. But the simplest way to help the black family would be to lock up fewer black men for non-violent offences.<br>

		<p>Unfortunately, unlike whites, black women are more likely to have children if they are unmarried than if they are married. The lonely black women don&rsquo;t bother to wait around to get married and decide to raise families by themselves. And we know how well that works&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is a rather sad story, and a rather poignant example of the social dysfunction which has grown to characterize black society since the Civil Rights Act began to work its final destruction of that unhappy race.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago blacks typically married and stayed married, more or less on the same basis as whites and other races in this country.  Today the great majority of black children  are born out of wedlock, and children of the same mother are likely to havw different fathers.</p>
<p>While I have no basis other than statistically meaningless personal observations, it seems to me that black females, on average, are more responsible and even perhaps more intelligent than black males.  Or perhaps they just seem that way due to the necessity of having to get along on their own.</p>
<p>Giving any group a rationale for failure is no favor.</p>

<p>Yes, and the others are looking for women in other racial groups, because black women are the least attractive.</p>
<p>The media likes to think that white men just bristle with hatred when the see a white woman with a black male, but, let me tell you, it is nothing like the hostility black women feel when they see the same thing.</p>
<p>Black women have to be horribly frustrated.  What few men they have want other women from other groups.</p>

		<p> Ah, yes; so typical of an article like this in today&rsquo;s politically correct media. Black men don&rsquo;t commit more crimes than others; they are &#8220;locked up&#8221; more often. The U.S. isn&rsquo;t an &#8220;advanced democracy;&#8221; it is &#8220;rich&#8221; and imposes harsher penalties on evildoers than other &#8220;rich&#8221; countries. Guess somebody just walked up and handed us this &#8220;rich&#8221; status.</p>
<p> And no mention is made whatsoever about another big factor in black women&rsquo;s difficulty in finding decent black men to marry: the preference of so many of said black men for &#8220;White chicks.&#8221; That would have made the story much more candid and accurate. But, of course, to mention that would have implied that something bad happens to blacks because of their own actions   &mdash;   not just because of &#8220;society&#8221; or &#8220;White racism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Honestly, black guys know if they go to jail for a non-violent offense they will become fodder for horny inmates.  So they up the game by resisting arrest or some other means to add to their own misery lest they lose &#8220;cred&#8221; on the inside.  </p>
<p>I personally think jail for non-violent offenders should be the last resort since cages should be reserved for animals and people society can&rsquo;t fix.  I&rsquo;m wondering why black women are so surprised about this when they are a huge part of the problem in the first place.  </p>
<p>MOST of the black guys in jail are born bastards.  Having that in the back of your mind surely doesn&rsquo;t create a lot of self esteem.</p>
<p>And they think it&rsquo;s &#8220;raising their game&#8221; to become MORE of a slut?  To attract a man who is out LOOKING for a slut is kind of stupid if your plans include a family.  </p>
<p>All you can expect is another single mother raising more problem sons while the &#8220;Playa&#8221; daddy runs off to impregnate as many whores (the actual word for Hoe) and sluts he can in order to prove his &#8220;manhood&#8221;.</p>
<p>With morals like these being so common in their communities, how can any of these women hope to improve their lineage?<br>

		<p>This is one of those theories that sound good (and will fool most people) until you actually begin to think about it.  The truth of the matter is that Black men simply don&rsquo;t want to get married, and even if they do get married, most abandon the marrage within 3 years.  For Black men, the urge for sex with new partners is usually greater than the love for a single wife.  That is why 80% of black children don&rsquo;t have a father living at home and that is why Black women and men have enormous numbers of sex partners (and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases). Other, but less important reasons for lack of marrage among Black women are that they can make more money from welfare by having children and remaining unmarried (i.e., Welfare programs create fatherless children and help perpetuate the cycle of poverty), and that many (if not most) Black men prefer women of other races.  </p>

<p>How laughable!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The collapse of the traditional family,&rdquo; was seen by both the white Marxists and black radicals alike, as a &ldquo;great leap forward.&rdquo; Indeed it might hurt blacks as a group, but theoretically it would also dramtically unbalance &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; and his complacence in the system he and his family was &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; with, so as to achieve an &ldquo;equality.&rdquo; Perhaps, not a perfect equality, but an &ldquo;equality&rdquo; nonetheless.</p>
<p>We might call it the Zimbabwe paradigm of race relations; or the Detroit diversity dialectic: &lsquo;so long as &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; and his suffer, we do not even require our basic needs to be met, in our &ldquo;communities&rdquo; of color.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>And she was surprised?  The average black male has not expected<br>
a relationship to be exclusive since the early &rsquo;60s. Why should an education change that outlook? <br>
Black women see the value of education; most black men see the value in basketball and tattoos. Any wonder an educated black woman can&rsquo;t find a male to marry in her own race. Respect and education are not two values you find in most black males. Self-respect and respect for others is not something learned in school; it is taught at home by the parents. <br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more at play here than just incarceration rates. Most of the males are plain unreliable and are constantly on the make, married or not. Yes, even the &#8220;honorable blue collar&#8221; types, as well as white collar ones, will run around on their spouses to the max. The vast majority of the men are just not marriage material as most people envision it. The females may not be any great bargain either.  </p>

		<p>The pool of potential mates would no doubt be larger for black women if their men stopped chasing after spouses of different races. But making it known to black men that white women are off-limits would be &#8220;racist&#8221; and we can&rsquo;t have that! And of course, the many young and naive white girls who have spent their whole lives being brainwashed by the left-wing media and the public schools about the wonders of blacks make very easy prey. That&rsquo;s where the parents should step in, but apparently these days many are totally clueless concerning racial matters and thus express little or no alarm.</p>

		<p>I work in the county courthouse.  Place is full of black male Judges, attorneys, clerks, court reporters, baliffs etc.  Many are married.  They are all gross offensive lechers. Some of the married ones are worse than the single ones. Worst of all are the black preachers who come to the criminal courts as character witnesses for the black felons.</p>

		<p>Richard, Edna, please no more internet hypnotism.  I can count on one hand the number of White male/black female couples I&rsquo;ve seen in my lifetime.  Statistics say there are 50,000 White men with black wifes, the number is insignificant and I suspect many of them are male goldiggers if the woman has financial means.  So girl if you hopin&rsquo; to snatch a White man, you barkin&rsquo; up the wrong tree.  Maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t be so lonely if you&rsquo;d take care of your body and eat healthy.  Join a gym, get on a treadmill, stay out of KFC, get on Jenny Craig, whatever it takes to get rid of that lava lamp figure.  Drop that bad attitude and those uppity airs you puttin on.  Girl you ain&rsquo;t all that! And they ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; wrong with marrying a man in prison.  Beggars can&rsquo;t be chosers.</p>

<p>Are you kidding?? There all ready is plenty of leniency.  How many times has Amren reported a story of a vicious attack by a criminal with a long rap sheet.  And we all know there is plenty of leniency for juveniles.  They get a clean slate when they turn 21.  </p>

		<p>Black women have both the worst prospects for finding men of their own race, and the most &#8220;racist&#8221; proclivities in mate choice (based on studies, not my assertion).</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t want to promote mixing, but try and imagine the outcry if a minority population of white women (say, in a surrounding population of blacks) had so few prospects within their own race, and stubbornly remained the women least likely to date and mate outside their race.  The media would never let it go.</p>
<p>But the author and the rest of the media fully expect us to sympathize with blacks, as usual, regardless of their behavior or who&rsquo;s really to blame.</p>

		<p> &#8220;IMAGINE that the world consists of 20 men and 20 women, all of them heterosexual and in search of a mate. Since the numbers are even, everyone can find a partner.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
They may find a partner, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that parner was what they ideally wanted   &mdash;  - just a partner, some partner, any partner. People are fussier than that.</p>
<p>Out of those 20 each,  maybe 10 (let&rsquo;s just suppose, to pick an arbitrary figure) got to &#8220;select, not settle&#8221; &hellip; so they&rsquo;re happy with their mates.   The other ten, however, had to &#8220;settle&#8221; and are not particularly happy about what they got.   They got the leftovers, so to speak, so they&rsquo;re always looking around for something better if they get a chance.  That&rsquo;s not going to make for a happy or stable marriage.</p>
<p>Blacks on the whole, especialy women, have pretty rotten pickings, frankly.  So, many black marriages are not very permanent.</p>

		<p>This is a load of crock.  The simple fact is that staggering numbers of white females have availed themselves to black men and the black men have predictably taken advantage of the opportunity provided by our demented cultural state. It&rsquo;s interesting how the purity of white racial lines is of utmost importance to the black male and his eugenic motives somehow politically justified.  For the white male to stay his racial course however, is considered racist.</p>

		<p>This article is hilarious! I love pieces like this that pretend to come to some sort of politically correct, racially sensitive conclusion that will make black women even more arrogant and vainly attempt to raise black men from being common street thugs to viable citizens. </p>
<p>The gist of this article is, &#8220;Black men don&rsquo;t like black women&#8221;. GEE, I WONDER WHY?! Have you ever spent more than five minutes around a group of black females? It&rsquo;s enough to drive anyone absolutely bonkers, even the most hardened of criminals. Not to mention, they&rsquo;re not exactly the most attractive species in the world; what with the hair weave, long fingernails, snotty attitude, gas-station perfume, cocoa butter and a strange conglomeration of odors from all the different hair products.</p>
<p>Black men don&rsquo;t find black women attractive because black women are not attractive. </p>
<p>That said, and I know there&rsquo;s a bit of a paradox considering marital rates for blacks before Civil Rights, but black infidelity is well-known. Combine that with high imprisonment rates; typical black male laziness; a female counterpart that is often more trouble than she&rsquo;s worth and you have the ultimate recipe for a race that isn&rsquo;t exactly marriage material. </p>

		<p>This is ludicrous.  Black women have children out of wedlock right and left.  Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but about 70% of all Black children today are born out of wedlock.  This is &#8216;Blacks acting like Blacks&rsquo; in a nutshell.  When the &#8216;genie was let out of the bottle&rsquo; so-to-speak back in the 1960&rsquo;s and Blacks were &#8220;allowed&#8221; to dictate their own behavior and White standards for them were abandoned, this became the result, and that is the fact that Blacks started committing more crimes.  It was inevitable that Black men would begin to be incarcerated more.  We must return to White standards for Black behavior; this probably will not happen unfortunately.  If we go into a fiscal depression - and some experts are predicting this - we will really see Black violence, and also Hispanic violence.  The worst is yet to come I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

		<p>Why do so many black women think they have to have children and a husband?  I know of many white women who are not married nor have children and the reasons are varied.  The black woman&rsquo;s problem is she feels she is entitled to a husband and a family.  The solution for any woman in that situation is to not breed at all or don&rsquo;t breed with the ones that won&rsquo;t be a father to the children.  Many white women do this already.</p>

		<p>&hellip;many young and naive white girls who have spent their whole lives being brainwashed by the left-wing media and the public schools about the wonders of blacks make very easy prey. That&rsquo;s where the parents should step in, but apparently these days many are totally clueless concerning racial matters and thus express little or no alarm.</p>
<p>Apparently, the suburban malls in my city are places where young black boys hang out looking for the naive white girl.  I see many young black men but not so many young white men.  Have they been chased away?  I think so.<br>
A few days ago I saw a father driving and Escalade pull up to the mall and drop of three white girls who looked to be between 16-18.  The girls had to walk past a throng of black hoodlums congregated outside the mall entrance to smoke. This father displayed no hesitation.  As soon as they were out the door he took off - not even seeing that they made it inside.  Wow!  I imagine his fear of being called a racist for questioning the situation is greater than the fear of harm coming to his daughter.  How sick is this?</p>

<p>  Many attractive, honorable, professional Southern black women have told me these things as well. Educated, successful black men are spoiled by the constant attention they receive from many desperate black women. Some of these men behave in a haughty and condescending manner toward these hopeful women. Only a precious few very successful and handsome white men can behave in a similar caddish fashion, for which they are roundly condemned. </p>

		<p>A few years ago, another pro-white nationalist website that used to also offer occasionally entertaining Web radio shows came up with an outstanding idea.    The idea was based on the trend we all have seen where websites have sprung up that offer dating services, such as those we commonly see that promote Jewish Singles who have a healthy desire and preference to only date and marry other Jewish Singles.   </p>
<p>Now, since our mainstream media is obviously controlled by people who despise the White race, they constantly promote race mixing between White women and Black males, and love to weave romances between whites and non-whites into literally every TV show or Hollywood movie that is made these days. </p>
<p>So, with this idea in mind - the pro-white nationalist web radio show suggested that we should set up a website that specifically promoted dating services between Blacks and Jewish singles.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for a grand idea?   Steer blacks away from our race to another race, which would satisfy their obvious cravings to <br>
miscegenate and since Noel Ignatiev did say that he supported racial mixing, I&rsquo;m sure he would be one of the first people to sign up for the new dating service.</p>

		<p>&#8220;She says that many black men and women, having been brought up by single mothers, are unsure what role a man should play in the home.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had the great fortune of peering into the homes of thousands of black people from 2000 to 2005 while working a 2nd job delivering pizza and chick&rsquo;n wangs in the great city of Lauderhill (Lauderkill) Florida four nights a week. Half the cusotomers were black, the other half lived in Plantation.</p>
<p>I usually encountered the same scenario : One of the keeds gets to tha&rsquo; doe first and stares at me holding food until I ask them to get their mom, please. Before they can even process this tough question the mother rushes the door, berates and usually strikes the child for opening the door. Then the four to 7 other children make their way to the door; peering out from around and between momma&rsquo;s legs. While momma fumbles through her purse I get a good couple minutes to stand at the doorway and enjoy the wafting aroma of urine and sometimes weed until I finally get stiffed. But the one thing that is constant&hellip;and I do mean CONSTANT among these homes is that virtually each and every television was tuned to one channel. B.E.T.  So my point here is that &#8216;these people&rsquo; have the opportunity to witness the billions of different portrayals of positive nuclear families in action <br>
around the dial but instead they are watching rap superstars like Nelly slide credit cards between womens&rsquo; buttcheeks and throwing dollar bills in the air. Oh and and they also always had 50 inch TVs set among $10 worth of other furniture and decoration. Oh man do I miss those days&hellip; having them wait for the change from a $19.87 order of wangs after handing you a $20.</p>

		<p> I actually feel a little bit sorry for the educated decent black women who cant find a mate. I know of several in this category. But it goes far beyond just the incarceration rates. Black men will have sex with anyone, but prefer white women. That in itself was not a problem until the last 30-40 years as white women were off limits. But now with all the PC and the media shoving black athletic and musical superiority to the public our gullible young ladies see these thugs as gods. Its 62% black where I live and I have much interaction with blacks. I would estimate that 15 to 20 % of the high school and college age girls here have black boyfriends. But its very rare to see a young white boy with a black girl, white men just do not see black women as attractive, except once in a while. so this leaves another problem. as with the educated black female single,, there are a lot of young white men who cant find a date also. I personally know of many many single white guys with little chance of finding a girl as there are so few for them. So,, while maybe 10-20% of our young white girls are having Obama babies a similar percentage of our young white boys are having no babies due to being single which is part of the problem with our declining birth rates. Another part of it is that many of the white girls that dont want blacks are the girls that wait longer to have children.  So, we often hear about the lonely single black woman, and it is true I believe,  but we never hear about all the single white guys who have been made lonely by our girls going over to the blacks.

		<p>What&rsquo;s left out of the analysis above is the effect changed welfare system rules destroyed what was left of black family values beginning in the sixties. </p>
<p>Black single mothers could live alone and fathers come and go as they wished without any responsibility to mother or child. In fact, the more children the mother had, the more money the state would award her. (Guess how that (still) works out)</p>
<p>This system tore apart what was left of loyalty to the black family, and incentivized the breaking of ties between mother and father. A large percentage of the children of these families inevitably became part of skyrocketing black crime statistics and black jail populations.</p>

<p>If Chinese man start picking black women, it would be a win-win situation,. Although I don&rsquo;t like miscegenation, these couples would significantly more intelligent. It&rsquo;s already happening in some parts of Africa as China expands in Africa and all of them are exclusively male. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, the chances of finding a real-life Cliff and Clair Huxtable are infinitesimally small, the storyline should just be written off as total fantasy.  So, what&rsquo;s wrong with being single? Why do black women continually preoccupy themselves with finding a husband or sexual partner?  We are constantly bombarded with images of black women on the make, regardless of their financial circumstances.  What about becoming a dedicated public servant, working tirelessly for causes like Sierra Club, animal rights, or joining a religious order?  Or is that just a white thing?</p>

Good advice. But as some posters have said, these girls and women come from single-mother homes where women have always ruled. Momma was queen of the roost.  That&rsquo;s what they have seen, and that&rsquo;s all they know. They expect to be IN CHARGE. They expect to have the last word.  </p>
<p>And that explains the &#8220;attitude&#8221; problem which will condemn them to be single mothers just like their own mothers and grandmothers before them.</p>

		<p>The demystification (for lack of a better term) of the &#8220;white woman&#8221; has long been promulgated by the Jewish media and, incredibly, incorporated into the mind set of liberal white Americans. The lesser races, namely blacks, are not only no longer fearful to approach whites in general (let alone our females) but they do so with an exaggerated sense of self confidence that, observed from a behavioral standpoint, is not dissimilar to the courting rituals of the endangered silver back mountain gorilla- an animal whose behavior, in this regard, results from surges in testosterone levels.  Self confidence, or &#8220;self concept&#8221;, among blacks is high. It is unrestrained by the propriety and humility that is respected- and expected- among whites when interfacing with strangers. In short, it is a blatant demonstration of an acute incapability to experience empathy or insight- the failure to calculate how one may be percieved by others. To a great degree, the media is the culprit.<br>
The iconization of Black atheletes over the decades has been nothing less than extrordinary. Sitcoms, television ads and television series all promote miscegenation by repeatedly bombarding young and impressionable whites with the notion that blacks make suitable husbands.<br>
After all, they are funny, no-nonsense, tell it like it is sort of fellas who know how to dance- both standing up and lying down.</p>
<p>THE TELEVISION&hellip; IS A POWERFUL THING, and political correction is its unyielding weapon. Now that we no longer feel comfortable saying &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; when December rolls around, it is, at least, good to know that our sisters have come to the realization that &#8220;Blacks are cool&#8221;.<br>
Who can blame them?<br>
How many of you reading my comment have not witnessed the scores of beer guzzling white dudes cheering for a black football player<br>
with a fervor they&rsquo;d never express for the reunification with a family member, a birth within the family, or an endeavor that ensures the solidarity of White Europeans throughout the world.<br>
No, we all know how important that touch down is. And on a biological/evolutionary level of true achievement, I believe such foolishness would rank far lower than the mating ritual of the endagered silverback mountain gorilla, a creature which political correction cannot touch when it is labeled as both black and animalistic.</p>

		<p>Two years ago my school took about 120 black and hispanic (HS) kids to a museum for a field trip.  (IN NYC)  All these kids came from all black/Hispanic neighborhoods, and they probalby never had any interaction with any white students, ever.</p>
<p>Anyway, about ten buses pull up while our kids were getting off their buses.  Out of the new buses came more white blond kids than I have ever seen in my whole life.  (I guess it was a visiting school from Wisconsin.)</p>
<p>Imagine the sight: a very long line of really pretty blond girls.  I am not joking, there were like a 100 or so of them.  All healthy with that midwestern glow.  My male students literally freaked out with lust.  Some of them sauntered over to the packs of white girls and started putting the charm on them, so smoothly, so filled with desire.</p>
<p>The black and brown girls standing near me literally put their heads down in shame, knowing they were not as pretty as that crowd of white girls.  I felt bad for those girls (they were my students) and I tried to make light of the situation and make them feel better, but they all knew the score: their black and brown male classmates were ready to dump them in a second for pretty blonds.</p>
<p>I and another teacher literally had to pry a bunch of our boys away from the white girls and drag them into the museum.  I will never forget that day.</p>

		<p>That is why Jay if I ever father a daughter, I will make her understand that to non-whites, she is nothing but a sexual conquest to them. Once they have a white female, they throw her out with the trash and move on to the next victim, I&rsquo;ve seen this and I resent it to put it politely. This is one reason why white males have hard times finding white women to form families with. I would teach her to avoid associating with non-white men, let alone dating or romantic involvement with them, and I will run non-white males off too. Non-white males do not restrain themselves sexually, and non-white females know it. They had good reason to be embarrassed at the behavior of their male cohorts. The thing that is tragic is that far more non-white women are decent people that their male counterparts, and they quite understandably resent their pursuit of white women. Non-white males pursue white females as a form of aggression against white males, because they know many white men consider white women who have sex with or worse yet have children with non-white men damaged goods.</p>

		<p>I am nonwhite (east asian) who lives in the midwest (a region of America reputed to produce pretty white girls). I see white women (and men) everyday here. The vast majority aren&rsquo;t what I would consider as an attractive lot. Personally white Americans are not a goodlooking people in general (don&rsquo;t know about Europeans though). This goes for the nonwhite Americans too.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s a good thing for white nationalist males as I don&rsquo;t find white females physically desirable&hellip;</p>
<p>I do think this country is going to become a melting pot, if the white nationalist movement doesn&rsquo;t succeed.  I have observed white women with nonwhite men and likewise white men with nonwhite women, where the couples are about aesthetically equal or the nonwhite partners are the more attractive ones. Thus, I am not so sure if the supposed &#8220;beauty&#8221; of white people (as put forth by a few posters here) is the reason for nonwhites &#8220;chasing&#8221; whites. Other factors are at play I think, proximity being the most likely. In other words, populations of different races/ethnic groups living close to each other tend to mix over time, plain and simple. </p>

		<p>My response is to Anonymous at #79:</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing that your comment is genuine, that you are being honest with the beliefs you have posted. For one to declare they believe that White Americans are physically unattractive is tantamount to accusing Michealangelo as being a bad painter. Incidentally, experts maintain he was and continues to be the greatest painter/sculptor the world has ever known. That is of no surprise. He was a white Florentine. I must say that &#8220;attractiveness&#8221; does not fall within the limitations of ones own racial heritage. Studies have proven, over and over again, that little black girls will choose &#8220;white&#8221; dolls over black dolls almost consistently. As the so called black dolls begin to appear more white, demonstrating white features, little black girls are more apt to choose them to play with.<br>
As a white man, a central Italian born of a mother with green eyes and a father with blue eyes, I must admit to being as biased as most men-<br>
we see our immediate brethren as good looking.<br>
Nevertheless research has proven that European &#8220;looks&#8221; are preferred the world over. Have you not heard of the surgical procedure in Japan that removes the eye &#8220;flap&#8221; from asians in order to allow them to appear more european? Look into it.  Have you ever heard of surgeons in Europe who attempt to transform a European face into an asian one?<br>
Of course not, that would be silly.<br>
No, my friend, you and I both know that the most physically attractive men and women in the world are European. Ironically, &#8220;beauty&#8221;, as it is defined, is a concept whose origin can be attributed to the ancient Greeks- a society made up of three distinct tribes who came from Nothern Europe- the Ionians, the Dorians to name two (unfortunately Ive forgotten the name of the third). Asians and Africans are terribly unattractive. The same goes for those who inhabit the sub continent of India, and anyone east of that geographical location. Beauty, among them and among your kind, can only be calculated if European features are present. I believe you know this.<br>
Beauty, as recognized by the human eye, has certain criteria, studies have shown. Above all is symmetry, be it facially or pertaining to the body. In other words, eyes spaced evenly apart will be more appealing to another than eyes that are unsymmetrically close together or far apart. The same holds for lips, nostrils, ears, ecc. Now, if the face of the male or female has some idiosyncratic deviance to this rule, it may often be a reflection of their personality which may render them less attractive-<br>
or,<br>
infinetally more attractive, feminine or masculine (as in a big nose on a man or full lips on a woman).<br>
In asians, Indians or Africans, such deviances will exacerbate features that were already unsynchronized, rendering the individual unpleasant to behold (despite a personality which may be quite pleasant). <br>
&#8220;Beauty&#8221;, as you and I know it, is not arbitrary. It does have a concrete definition when pertaining to a human. And all studies have shown that Europeans have the market on it.<br>
That is, of course, no surprise.</p>
