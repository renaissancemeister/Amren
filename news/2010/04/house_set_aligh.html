			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Buks Viljoen, Beeld (Johannesburg), April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attackers set a wooden house on fire on a farm near Carolina at the weekend, while a woman and her children were still inside. The armed attackers had tied the door with a piece of wire, trapping the victims inside.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s parents were shot at when they rushed to their aid.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were bent on killing us. This had nothing to do with theft,&#8221; said Cornelia de Wet, 32, from the farm Kwaggafontein, near Carolina.</p>
<p>She woke up to the smell of smoke at about 22:00 on Saturday night. She saw the wall and the curtain in her room were in flames.</p>
<p>The attackers had poured diesel on the house before setting it on fire.</p>
<p><strong>Lost consciousness</strong></p>
<p>De Wet tried in vain to wake two of her children, Cornelia, 11, and Joey, 2, who were sleeping on the double bed with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently the smoke made them lose consciousness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She extinguished the burning curtain and tried to open the door, but couldn&rsquo;t, because it was tied with a piece of wire.</p>
<p>Her parents, Nelie, 62, and Jan de Wet, 65, live in the farmstead about 50m from her house. Her other daughter, Sarah, 8, was sleeping at the farmstead that night.</p>
<p>De Wet called her parents for help over the two-way radio, which had been installed barely two weeks prior to the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they came out of the house, shots were fired at them from the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grandparents shot into the dark with a shotgun and a pistol in an attempt to chase away the attackers.</p>
<p>De Wet said they also shot at her when she leaned through the kitchen window to untie the wire around the latch of the door.</p>
<p>According to her, the shootout lasted for nearly two hours.</p>
<p>Attempts to contact the police in Carolina, about 12km from the farm, were initially fruitless because they didn&rsquo;t answer their phone.</p>
<p>She then phoned her brother, Jan de Wet jnr, who farms near Belfast.</p>
<p><strong>Shots still flying</strong></p>
<p>He rushed to the farm. &#8220;When I got there, the shots were still flying,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I yelled at the attackers that I was going to kill them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He, too, started firing in the direction of the attackers. The shooting then settled down.</p>
<p>De Wet jnr estimated that there were between 10 and 15 attackers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The attack was planned in great detail and they came prepared with enough ammunition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police picked up 9mm and shotgun shells as well as a few rounds near the two houses.</p>
<p>One of the rounds was of a strange calibre that is not known to the police.</p>
<p>The long grass hampered the search for evidence, but De Wet jnr did say they found footprints near the scene.</p>
<p>No-one was injured in the attack.<br/>

		<p>Get out of there! Get out as fast as possible. You must be naive to believe that South Africa will not go the way of Zimbabwe. It will. If you cannot leave for Anglo nations like Australia or Canada where the requirements for migration are strict (especially for Whites) learn Spanish and try Argentina or Uruguay. Or learn Belarusian and migrate to Belarus. Standard of living may not be as high as it is in nations like Australia but you will at least be in civilization. If you cannot leave South Africa, try moving to places where there is a higher density of White people.</p>

		<p>White farm murders since the &#8220;liberation&#8221; of South Africa now over 3000.(Those badly injured - much more.) This happens almost daily. It is getting so bad now that I am having nightmares about some of my family still living in more rural areas of the country. Most often, nothing of value is stolen. </p>
<p>It is all about killing and torturing whites. Just search for the words &#8220;kill the boer&#8221; (=white Afrikaans farmer) or &#8220;kill the farmer&#8221; or an idiot called &#8220;Julius Malema&#8221; - another Robert Mugabe in the making. Facebook is now censoring certain comments of folk opposing attacks on whites in SA. Go figure; but it is OK to have Facebook pages calling for the killing of white folk in this country. Unbiased media my %#*&^</p>
<p>In any case, those of us who cannot leave due to financial reasons, are now very worried what will happen soon. The race war is coming - much sooner than we all expected.</p>
<p>Watch out in whatever country you are that are still majority white - remember we are the MINORITY here, but they still have passed laws AGAINST us to keep whites out of jobs - kind of like Apartheid in reverse. Apparently Apartheid was wrong when blacks where the supposed victims, but it is NOT wrong when the minority whites are the victims. The western media has not uttered ONE WORD against the racial discrimination against us that is LEGAL in this country.</p>
<p>Ok, enough rambling. Please think of us in the coming months&hellip;</p>

		<p>They wanted to kill.<br/>
They didn&rsquo;t want money because they were poor. They didn&rsquo;t want jobs. They just wanted to kill whites. Nothing less. I wonder how much it will take until hollywood brings a new movie in which white racist want to kill and burn the houses of poor hard working blacks for no reason.</p>

		<p>As a recent article in American Thinker points out, there is <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/04/genocide_in_south_africa.html" rel="nofollow"> Genocide Against South Africans</a>. (Be sure to read the comments.) The Left can only see bigotry in whites, never anyone else.</p>

		<p>I suspect some of these attackers will be back in one form or another in the next few months. This family better be thinking ahead and have a plan.</p>

<p>Fritz, you can start by stopping your country from sending aid and investment capital to South Africa. It just goes to feeding the corrupt coffers of the black government.<br/>

<p>The trade union <a href="http://www.solidaritysa.co.za/" rel="nofollow">Solidarity</a> has a Helping Hand charity that helps impoverished Afrikaners. Their web site seems to be having navigation difficulties at present, but you can email them at enquiries(at)solidariteit.co.za.</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern.</p>

		<p>Hi, all White people all over the world.</p>
<p>I am Jan de Wet, the farmer were the above farm attack happend.<br/>
We are under siege in the NSA, and I believed that the ANC are behind all the attacks on whites.<br/>
Yes, a good start will be to tell your goyerments not to send any aid to South Africa - because most of it will get stolen by the blacks.<br/>
We are ready for the attackers to return - and even more ready to make war if the blacks wants n war.<br/>
Thank you to all Whites that are helping the Boers in South Africa.</p>
