<h1>Flat Unemployment Rate Masks the Race Gap</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Glatnz, New America Media, April 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. economy added 162,000 jobs in March, but the unemployment rate held steady at 9.7 percent, according to new figures released by the Labor Department Friday.</p>
<p>On the whole, the economic news was mixed, but for African Americans, it was particularly troubling. The unemployment rate for whites held steady at 8.8 percent compared to February and went down for Asians from 8.4 percent to 7.5 percent. But it rose to 16.5 percent for blacks from 15.8 percent. Hispanics showed a slight increase as well from 12.4 percent to 12.6 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very disappointing,&#8221; said Peter Edelman, a former Clinton administration official who directs the Center on Poverty, Inequality, and Public Policy at the Georgetown University.</p>
<p>While there have long been disparities in white and minority employment, Edelman said, the latest unemployment numbers from the Labor Department show that while &#8220;some white people got jobs, some black people and Latinos actually fell behind more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re seeing a whole set of things happening in the recession that are making the inequity worse,&#8221; said Seth Wessler, a researcher at the Applied Research Center, a racial justice think tank in Oakland.</p>
<p>Chief among those factors are the massive cuts meted out to public services on the state and local level, particularly to public transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the bus line you depend on is cut, it&rsquo;s impossible to look for a job or even hold onto the one you have,&#8221; Wessler said, &#8220;and we know that across the country  &mdash;  from New York to Los Angeles  &mdash;  bus service is being cut and fares are increasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that people of color are much more likely to depend on public transportation,&#8221; he added. &#8220;White people are not being impacted in quite the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The jobs that we project over the next decade that are reasonably well paying involve a degree of skills and a degree of preparation,&#8221; [Edelman] added, &#8220;and people of color have disparate educational attainment,&#8221; and will be less able to land that work without an associates degree or certificate from a local community college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other efforts at major federal job training and employment programs have floundered in Congress because of Republican opposition, Edelman said, and Obama has not done enough to overcome it.</p>
<p>Minority communities will likely see an increase in the coming months as the Census Bureau hires 700,000 enumerators who help count the U.S. population, said Heidi Shierholtz, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.</p>

<p>Voters in St. Louis County, Missouri approved a half-cent increase in the sales tax yesterday to fund St. Louis&rsquo;s public transit system, which recently had to make severe cutbacks because of money problems.  The new money will mean that it can restore the service cuts.</p>
<p>But why was it experiencing money shortfalls to begin with?  The main reason was that the most recent addition to St. Louis&rsquo;s light rail system opened two years behind schedule and $200 million over budget because of incompetent black affirmative action contractors.  Also, like many big city transit systems, the administrators are either minorities or white liberals, who hire as many minority bus drivers and other employees as possible.  You know, the type that spend so much of their work day complaining about how hard they have to work.</p>

<p>Especially if, like so many blacks, you drive the bus or work in some other local government agency that has had to cut back. The lions share of the black middle class exists because of government employment or affirmative action. That&rsquo;s why 96% voted for Obama, who believes in unlimited taxation of productive whites to create make work jobs in government for blacks.</p>

		<p>When blacks complain about how high their unemployment rate is in white devil America, I just want to point out to them what the black unemployment rate is in any black majority nation, or an all black nation, namely Haiti, which is at 80% and rising. </p>

		<p>Well, goodness me, do you suppose that the high school graduation rate for blacks (average less than 30% here in L.A.) just MIGHT have something to do with the fact that they are jobless in greater numbers?????  Choices, choices, people.  You make &#8216;em, you live by &#8216;em, and there&rsquo;s no one to blame for them but YOU.</p>

		<p>For young black men, the unemployment rate is even higher, nearly 50%. According to Thomas Sewell, in his book &#8216;Race and Culture&rsquo;, from 1890 to 1950 the black unemployment rate was lower than that of whites. </p>

		<p>The majority of jobs added were temporary census takers.<br>
Whom will become unemployed when they are no longer needed.<br>
The government is hiding the true unemployment figures.<br>
According to one very reliable source, the method used in<br>
the 1980&rsquo;s in measuring unemployment would now be a<br>
truthful 21% and growing.</p>

		<p>How come people like comrade Glantz never compare the black employment rate to the hispanic employment rate. Not that the black leaders would want him to, because, afterall, they don&rsquo;t care about black employment either. They instead care about hispanic employment and call immigration restrictionists racists, knowing well that my allowing massive immigration, blacks get hurt. Yes, liberal/progressive people like Comrade Glantz are always stuck in a one track, anti-white mode. Take heart comrade, Robert Reich, is doing his best to make sure whites don&rsquo;t get any blue collar or contruction jobs, a very troubling problem for Mr. Reich, when they do, as he himself said.</p>

<p>THIS is all they care about, ONLY this. The &#8220;public transportation&#8221; allows thugs to range further for prey. Personally, I doubt any cuts have been made to welfare and such programs because I can&rsquo;t imagine blacks just accepting the reduction of freebies without being &#8220;outraged&#8221; and rioting.</p>

<p>Right you are and as an added bonus brought about by &#8220;public transit&#8221; whenever a bus or light rail enters into a new area the black thugs come looking for prey and shortly after the malls and shops start closing&hellip;.I have seen no exception to this.</p>

		<p>I saw countless times when I as a white woman who worked in construction for years, what happened when blacks came to the jobsite totally unprepared.  Never mind that many of them never even finished high school-too many of them acted like they had never held a job more than five minutes in their life!  I&rsquo;m the first to agree that life isn&rsquo;t always fair and there are prejudiced people out there; but blacks are probably responsible for at least 80% of the problems they have with obtaining and then holding employment.  I particularly enjoyed hearing them complain nonstop about their &#8220;oppression.&#8221;  I used to tell them that as being Jewish on one side of my family I could claim over 5000 years of oppression, and as a female, I could claim 40,000!<br>
But ultimately, my point is that if blacks ever stopped being lazy and bringing their little dramas and problems to work, they would have a much better chance of being hired.</p>
