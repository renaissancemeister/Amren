			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Virginia Wheeler and Nadia Brooks, Sun (London), April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BRITAIN is becoming a battleground for the notorious Bloods and Crips gangs that once brought fear to Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Around a QUARTER of mobs in London now align themselves with the two crime networks. </p>
<p>The massive UK market for cocaine has led to second generation members launching a new &#8220;front&#8221; here and in Spain. </p>
<p>A recent police census into gangs in the capital found 17 of 70 recognised crews are now Bloods or Crips. </p>
<p>Officers have reported a &#8220;more organised aspect&#8221; to street gang activities. </p>
<p>A Sun investigation found that hundreds of members are donning the gangs&rsquo; red or blue colours and bragging of their allegiances on social networking sites.</p>
<p>Insiders said small street crews have been grouping together  &mdash;  copying the LA supergangs&rsquo; culture and tactics and communicating with overseas counterparts. </p>
<p>Youth worker Twilight Bey, 40, warned yesterday: &#8220;Britain&rsquo;s gang problem in 2010 is where LA was in the bad days of the 1980s. </p>
<p>&#8220;Youths here have adopted a culture they don&rsquo;t fully understand and the consequences will be a generation of shattered lives.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ex-LA gangster Twilight  &mdash;  who now works to curb gang violence in West London  &mdash;  said kids as young as SEVEN are carrying knives and swearing allegiance to UK Bloods and Crips. </p>
<p>He said: &#8220;For some it&rsquo;s not serious  &mdash;  they see it as games or part of their street culture and identity to adopt practices from LA. </p>
<p>&#8220;But the problem starts when they carry knives and get into arguments  &mdash;  then the violence follows and gang membership escalates.&#8221; </p>
<p>UK crime expert Wensley Clarkson said former LA-based Bloods and Crips are now plying their trade in Europe. </p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Britain offers rich pickings for these gangs as there&rsquo;s still a huge market for cocaine.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ex-LA Crips member Melvin Johnson, 38, said youth knife crime in the UK has &#8220;shocked&#8221; criminals in California. </p>
<p>He works to prevent gang crime after serving 11 years for drug offences. </p>
<p>Melvin said: &#8220;Britain needs help bad. Over here was terrible but your country is now famous for being Broken Britain.&#8221; </p>
<p>Police told The Sun Bloods and Crips rivalry in London intensified after the stabbing of Seyi Ogunyemi, 16, in Stockwell last April. </p>
<p>He was caught up in tensions between the Bloods-supporting O-Tray gang and the Crips&rsquo; All Bout Money. </p>
<p>Some gangs like the South London-based Cherry Young Bloods have posted videos of themselves in red scarves on the web. </p>
<p>More than 1,000 gangs were known to be operating in Britain last year. </p>
<p>The Crips were founded in 1969 and made huge profits from crack cocaine. </p>
<p>Their name referred to their &#8220;crippled&#8221; victims. </p>
<p>The Bloods were a splinter group who inflicted horrific violence. </p>
<p>Murdered rap legends Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G) and Tupac (2Pac) Shakur were allegedly linked with the Crips. <br>

		<p>I have to make what I think is a slight correction to this article.  I ill imagine that the Bloods and Crips have an international headquarters, or even a national one.  It&rsquo;s just that blacks in other American cities, and now London, have adopted the red-blue imagery and &#8220;culture&#8221; of Los Angeles gangs.  </p>
<p>A movie that helped spread the blood/crip imagery in various American cities as &#8220;Colors,&#8221; in 1988 or so.  </p>
<p>In St. Louis, there is an interesting dichotomy between blacks in the Missouri side of the river and blacks on the Illinois side of the river.  The MO ones mostly adopt blood-crip imagery, while the ones in IL and ESL mainly use Chicago-style gang imagery, like the Gangsta Disciples.  The reason ESL&rsquo;s blacks do that is because they picked it from doing time with Chicago blacks in IL state prisons.</p>

		<p>What the article doesn&rsquo;t point out is that the gang members in England aren&rsquo;t all Crips and Bloods who have arrived there from LA, they are mainly black kids who were born in england who want to align themselves with a scary gang name.</p>
<p>People forget that the police who have to deal with these criminals are only armed with a baton - English police on the beat do not carry firearms.</p>

		<p>We had low IQ &#8216;Bloods and Crips&rsquo; franchisees in the North of Melbourne and all over the South pacific too.<br>
Polynesians especially were for some strange reason, really attracted to the &#8216;glamorous&rsquo; gang lifestyle.<br>
I just can&rsquo;t relate.</p>
<p>I think they may have worked out from watching twenty years of hip hop videos, that if you undertake the &#8216;historically oppressed victim&rsquo; status you can use that as a justiciation/rationalisation for all sorts of violence.<br>
But this position just doesn&rsquo;t fit wth their own history.<br>
It didn&rsquo;t help their situation that mommy and daddy would rule the roost with a heavy hand, by regulary beating the Bejesus out of them for disciplines sake (the mothers especially.)<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;the consequences will be a generation of shattered lives.&#8221;, says a youth worker.</p>
<p>Yet another social worker having trouble facing reality. Actually it will be several generations. Races and ethnic groups mostly associate with each other, sort of like extended families, so these problems will stay among the group for a very long time. I don&rsquo;t think the social work profession has any theories about the ethnic dimension and the long time duration needed for remediation. Social workers should be ashamed of themselves for pretending they have answers for black underclass problems. I think it is a systemic bias in their theories of society that they would prefer not receive a thorough airing in public. </p>

<p>These gangs do have an international presence. NOT necessarily a HQ but a presence. Even the American outlaw motorcycle gangs such as the Hells Angels are active in Europe. The Danes in particular had to ask for American detectives and police to be sent to Denmark to advise the locals how to deal with the home-bred Hells Angels who had adopted all the bad customs of their American mentors. </p>

Americans keep forgeting that UK newspapers are mostly headline screaming Tabloids(topless pinups!)I saw similar headlines back in the 90&rsquo;s in Canada, some teenage fool declears himself a &#8220;Crip&#8221; etc and the newspapers have a field day, one Top Toronto Cop rightly called them wannabes! some these kids actually grew up quite middle class homes, in fact the famous &#8220;Biggie Smalls&#8221; rapper grew up in a quiet area of Brooklyn in a pricey Condo with his mom a NYC nurse, in his songs he would claim he grew up in a ghetto! when it was far from that at all, his devout Christian mother(Jamaican) was horrified by his foul mouthed lyrics.</p>
<p>And Jessica UK cops do carry guns, its worn under their jackets and patrol cars carry MP 5&rsquo;s in the trunk, however they do need permission to take them out and the mags only have about 15 rounds.<br>

		<p>Blacks still have that tribal feeling, and want to belong to something.</p>
<p>Whites seem content to just float in space, unattached.</p>
<p>Whites were once attached to their countries, but their countries have disappeared.</p>
<p>But whites are finding some things to attach themselves to&hellip;in the U.S., the inchoate tea party movement, in Britain, the very focused BNP.</p>

		<p>Now fast forward 50-100 years.  The Crips and Bloods and Mexican gangs and others have their own territories they control.  I&rsquo;m talking they rule huge swaths of puppet soveriegn nations and the &#8216;official&rsquo; governments can do nothing about it except obey.</p>
<p>Massive armies of irregular &#8216;soldiers&rsquo; (gang members on the street level) can be put in the field (or city blocks) and do battle or plunder at the whims of the overlords (the Mexican gangs routinely fight the mexican army now). </p>
<p>This is a part of the future of the people of earth.  The environment will be degraded until it cannnot support our kind any longer.  Whites will retreat to inhospitable northern climes and whither away.  Disease, pestilence and famine will swarm over the earth due to the collapse of civilization.  That is why our species is doomed to extinction.</p>

		<p>This has nothing to do with LA gangs,  before this they had Yardies.   This is a product of the policy of racist colonialism run by the Revolting Elite against their own nation, something that actually is a product of American gangsters,  the ones in the media and academia who enforce political correctness and proselytize for it, not Crips and Bloods.   The <i>Sun</i> can&rsquo;t by law criticize multi-racialism so they babble nonsense about LA gangs.  </p>

		<p>#7 Actually, what I said was that Police in England do not carry firearms on the beat which is correct. They routinely carry them in northern ireland. There are some groups that do, but most don&rsquo;t. From wikipedia:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Unlike police in other developed countries, the vast majority of British police officers do not carry firearms on standard patrol; they do however carry Extendable &#8220;Asp&#8221; or fixed Monadnock PR-24 batons and CS/PAVA spray.&#8221;</p>

		<p>While in Kuwait a few years ago a rather large group of black American bloods or crips, WTH they were came to Kuwait. Some of them got into trouble and were arrested, they cried and whimpered abnout their rights (of which they have none in Kuwait) and the police promptly went and arrested ALL ot them and when I left Kuwait for Iraq the gangstas were still in jail and the charges were drug dealing which is punishible by hanging in Kuwait/beheading in Saudi. Don&rsquo;t know what the result of it was, but Kuwait police are intolerant of drugs.</p>

		<p>The other night BBC4 (a digital channel) showed a &#8220;Play For Today&#8221; from about 1958, illustrating the &#8220;plight&#8221; of West Indian immigrants to England (the setting was London).</p>
<p>To be honest, I have no doubt that there were many decent West Indians who did experience terrible prejudice and discrimination from some of the indigenous population, but the programme was so one-sided and blatant in its own prejudices: all of the West Indians, men and women, were shown without exception as good-natured, intelligent, deeply religious (indeed rather saintly) and extremely sexually temperate, while the working-class whites were mostly shown as the very opposite of all of those things.</p>
<p>So, this propaganda has been going on for a very long time, and although I take &#8220;Bud&#8220;&#8216;s point about White Liberals being a deadlier &#8220;gang&#8221; than the Bloods and the Crips, we can see what the end result of such misrepresentation is: the spread of a wholly alien gang culture in a once civilised European country.</p>

		<p>The author of the above isn&rsquo;t admitting it, but gun crimes by these same people have accelerated the last few years.  As the situation increases in frequency and intensity more guns will be brought in, and the streets of the UK will look something like N.O. or Chicago.</p>
<p>But, not to worry.  The mentally challenged, self-appointed elites have banned all guns, so guns will no longer be a problem.</p>
