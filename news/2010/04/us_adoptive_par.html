<h1>US Adoptive Parents Seek Girls, Non-Black Children: Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>US parents looking to adopt a child prefer girls over boys, and non-black children over African-Americans, according to a new study carried out by a group of economists.</p>
<p>The team from the California Institute of Technology, the London School of Economics and New York University studied five years worth of data from 2004-2009 culled from a website run by an adoption intermediary.</p>
<p>They were able to see which babies attracted most applications from adoptive parents, and how much the parents would need to pay to finalize the adoption.</p>
<p>They found that a non-African-American baby was seven times more likely to &#8220;attract the interest and attention of potential adoptive parents than an African-American baby,&#8221; said Leonardo Felli, an economics professor at LSE.</p>
<p>But there was not a similar preference in favor of Caucasian babies over Hispanic babies, even though all the adoptive parents in the sample were Caucasian, Felli said.</p>
<p>The research also uncovered a unexpectedly strong preference in favor of girls, which were a little over a third more likely to attract the attention of adoptive parents than a boy, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With biological children, the literature shows that there&rsquo;s a slight but significant preference for boys over girls,&#8221; said Leeat Yariv, an associate professor of economics at Caltech. &#8220;But in adoption, there&rsquo;s a very strong preference for girls over boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bias in favor of girls and non-black children was seen across all categories of adoptive parents, and the gender bias against boys was even slightly stronger among gay men and lesbian couples seeking to adopt a child.</p>
<p>The study also found that interest in a child was highest just before birth, but dropped off dramatically immediately afterwards and was also low when the birth mother was still in the early stages of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Mariagiovanna Baccara, an assistant professor at NYU, said it suggested that &#8220;bureaucratic obstacles disrupting an adoption plan at the time of birth are extremely detrimental to the future prospects of the child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Felli said the adoption system in the United States remains doubly imbalanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, a considerable number of potential adoptive parents are left unmatched. On the other hand, the number of children who are not adopted and end up in the foster-care system is disproportionately high.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers said their data showed that obstacles to adoption of US children by gay couples or foreigners stood to significantly increase the number of children who would end up in foster care after failing to find an adoptive family.</p>
<p>&#8220;And statistically,&#8221; Yaariv added, &#8220;long-term foster care leads to bad outcomes.&#8221;<br/>

<p>So Whites don&rsquo;t want to adopt black babies.  How dreadful.  Was there a similar study done to determine how many <i>blacks</i> are adopting black babies?   But we mustn&rsquo;t talk about <i>that</i>, of course.</p>
<p>The only thing shocking about this &#8220;study&#8221; is that so many Whites opted to adopt mestizos.</p>

		<p>Here in NYC you see it all the time - White women with non-White babies, and I don&rsquo;t mean mulatto babies, I mean one can tell that they&rsquo;re not the biological children of the White woman or White parents.  I see it regularly.  They think they&rsquo;re being good little politically correct White people and &#8220;helping every other race but their own&#8221;.  They seem to think that this makes them a good person, to do what the TV and media want them to do.  Some of them refuse to have children of their own thinking it is &#8220;evil&#8221; to do so.  Talk about being brainwashed.</p>

		<p>Among single, liberal, educated, economically well off white women there seems to be a leaning toward the adoption of black baby boys, but this is just my unscientific observation.  </p>
<p>Black boys can grow into threatening adults, who will be throwing their weight around by their teenage years. </p>

		<p>One thing that I did not see in the article is that many white families will go to China to adopt unwanted baby girls and to South Korea to adopt children there. Instead of allowing foreigners to adopt their children, I would like to see China and South Korea do what India is doing by giving first preference to those who were born in India but now live elsewhere and to those whose parents were born in India. They also encourage domestic adoptions of unwanted baby girls by childless couples.</p>

		<p> Not sure why in particular the study found such a preference for girls over boys in selection of adopted children; it seems as if the AFP reporter could have at least attempted to gather some considered opinions on that. On the other hand, we all know why most adoptive parents don&rsquo;t want black kids. A multi-cultist would say it&rsquo;s due to &#8220;White racism.&#8221; But I beg to differ: It&rsquo;s because of the bad track record so many black children have when it comes to behavioral problems, teen delinquency, etc., etc. Plus, Hispanic children, if basically White, fit in much more easily with a Caucasian family.</p>
<p> But here&rsquo;s what mystified me about the whole thing: Why in a study of five years of adoptions, was every adoptive family studied, White? Was the writer deliberately trying to &#8220;set up&#8221; White adoptive parents as &#8220;racist&#8221; for the purposes of the story? Wonder how many black or Hispanic adoptive parents in those five years expressed preferences for one of their own? We&rsquo;ll never know, based on THIS study.</p>

		<p>Black children are trouble. They will be hounded by other blacks for having white parents. They will resent the white adoptive parents for taking them out of their culture, but nary a word or thought will be given to their own natural parents&rsquo; shortcomings and why they were landed in an adoption agency to begin with. They will perform horribly in school and blame it on white society and their white adoptive parents. They will, in rebellion against their white adoptive parents, join gangs and be swept up by the police for criminal activity.</p>
<p>Black children are toxic for white parents. They will be a social, financial and emotional liability. If blacks would fix their community and get their sorry selves together, there wouldn&rsquo; t be a dillemma here and blacks could simply adopt their own or, better yet, not have to resort to adopting their kids out. </p>

		<p>Just wait - they&rsquo;ll make a &#8220;preference&#8221; rule that a white couple can&rsquo;t adopt a white baby without taking a black one as well.  They&rsquo;ll pitch it as a two-for-one instant family plan.  Don&rsquo;t want a black baby?  Then get to the back of the line and stay there forever.  </p>

		<p>I am surprised that the researchers seem surprised over these results.  After what we see on the news, day after day, of the criminal actions of young black males, who wants to take one into their home?  Not me, and not anybody I know!  In most cases, the biological parents are drug addicts/alcoholics, and since that is genetic, the chances of the child being chips off the old block are 50% and higher than if neither parent was an addict or alcoholic.  This is rampant in the black community; and as a former teacher, trust me - no teacher wants an out of control black male in their classroom.  And more often than not, this is exactly what an adoptive family gets if they take in a black male child.  It can certainly happen with whites or Hispanic kids too; but it&rsquo;s nearly a guarantee with black kids.</p>

		<p>Girls are more obedient, quicker to learn, and less aggressive than boys. Now substitute &#8220;white/hispanic/asian&#8221; for girls and &#8220;blacks&#8221; for boys in the previous sentence. And then you see why black kids are passed over for adoption. Nobody wants to spend tens of thousands of dollars raising a child who will end up sucker punching you because you told him to turn off the TV and do his homework.</p>

		<p>In light of (pun intended) the silly Whites who kidnapped, or should I say poached, Haitian children, this is good news.</p>
<p>Whites should take care of their own.  All peoples should (civilized peoples, that is).  If a White couple cannot have children, or have room for an orphan, their first thought should be to adopt a White child.  Our race, country, and culture are White.  Bringing in aliens does nothing for society, and while it may leave the non White adoptee better off than living in a third world hell hole or black ghetto, the kid will always be slightly apart from the White world.  Worse, he will learn to, and be encouraged to, resent it.</p>
<p>Whites are probably the only people in existence who question their own right to exist and would leave orphans to disgusting evil perverts.<br/>

		<p>&ldquo;The bias in favor of girls and non-black children was seen across all categories of adoptive parents, and the gender bias against boys was even slightly stronger among gay men and lesbian couples seeking to adopt a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But did Comrade Yaariv and his group of enslaved Young Pioneers, factor in black on black adoption rates? If not, why not?</p>
<p>As is typical, they probably didn&rsquo;t; God and Karl Marx only knows, &ldquo;inexplicable inequalities&rdquo; in such matters, are answered with one solution, &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A black man rapes a white woman, it is calculus that ends with a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; demonstrating &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; A white man is murdered by a black; thus, algebra considers &ldquo;white male privileges&rdquo; and the &ldquo;equation&rdquo; stands as solved by &ldquo;anti-racism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>One can also solve such problems by putting &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; into the results and working backwards, but I do digress:</p>

		<p>Why were only white couples studied? Is it to prove how racist white people are for daring to prefer to adopt white babies? The article is titled &#8220;US Adoptive Parents&hellip;&#8221; not &#8220;White US Adoptive Parents.&#8221; To me, it would imply that a study was done on all American couples, regardless of their race, who choose to adopt.  The article is misleading from the get go. Where is the study on the racial preferences of black couples who adopt? Or Asian couples who adopt? Why only white people?</p>

		<p>According to the Economist, over 100 million baby girls are missing from the region of China and India.  They were the victims of abortion or infanticide by parents who wanted sons.</p>
<p>If scarce Chinese baby girls are being adopted by whites, there must be money involved.</p>

		<p>This could also be seen another way: Whites aren&rsquo;t having children of their own when they can. A woman&rsquo;s ability to have children is reduced from age 26 onwards, so if a woman puts off having a family for her career she may find at the end of her career that she can&rsquo;t have children and so is forced to adopt if she wants children, and she will most likely adopt a child that looks like her so she can emotionally bond with it.</p>

		<p>I still can&rsquo;t get the image out of my mind.   A recent and now closed hate blog  at Sewanee Episcopal University made fun of the pretty White Sewanee girls who are demanding more campus afro Diversity. Blog called Sewanee Mandingos.  Claimed that the White girls wanted to make mulatto babies with the Sewanee Mandingos, i.e. the Sewanee Diversity Stereotypes.  The gist was that interracial sex is the logical conclusion of any White girl&rsquo;s fondness for Diversity. White girls who say &#8220;Diversity&#8221;, other than to curse it, are implicitly infected with the jungle fever and lust after the African embrace. </p>
<p>One of the pictures showed a beautiful, smiling, blonde, blue eyed White Family, and the message on it was</p>
<p>MAKING WHITE BABIES IS A HATE CRIME AGAINST HUMAN DIGNITY.</p>
<p>On a picture of a White mother holding an ugly mulatto baby read</p>
<p>ALL WHITE BABIES ARE RACISTS. DON&rsquo;T MAKE ONE. OPEN YOUR WHITE WOMB TO THE SEWANEE MANDINGOS AND MAKE A TRULY AMERICAN OBAMBA BABY.</p>
<p>White women who adopt non white babies actually believe that kind of sickness, and for that reason enough I will continue to hate White women particularly and the White race in general.</p>
<p>No other race is susceptible to suicidal insanity as is my White Anglo Saxon Race.    Is Jesus to blame?  I&rsquo;m a Christian, so I&rsquo;ll say no.  In the name of my Savior Jesus, I beg my White Race to defend itself against the non White races, but failing that, I want the non white races to teach the Race Reality lesson to White Evangelical Christians through the Diversity Treatment.  During the robbing, raping, and murdering, I want to hear my White Brothers and Sisters pray to Jesus that sweet song about &#8220;loving my enemies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jesus never met OUR enemies, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have said that.  Jesus never witnessed the Knoxville Horror.</p>
<p>More Race misery for progressive Whites is just the medicine we need as a people.</p>
<p>Eve Carson was a multiculturalist and supported a Diversity housing initiative in Chapel Hill.   Case closed.</p>
<p>We still have  Race Problems in  this country. We have integration, miscegenation, mutilation. That&rsquo;s the kind of Race Problem that increasingly destroys my White America.</p>
<p>Ever since 1948, White people stopped given the correct answer to the Race Question.  Now we don&rsquo;t even know how to ask it, but it surrounds and threatens always.  Some of us won&rsquo;t live to find the answer, others will ignore the answer when it becomes most needed, and the rest of us will be put in prison.</p>

		<p>Wow, this is really a shocker!  Whites seeking to adopt a child prefer whites and Hispanics to black babies.  </p>
<p>Whatever ever one&rsquo;s attitude regarding blacks, a white couple adopting a black child is an invitation to disaster, whatever the good intentions of the white foster parents or the love the black child might have for its white adoptive parents.  The pressure put on the poor kid by other blacks would be excruciating for the child.  I suppose if the family lived in Boise, Idaho or perhaps Billings, Montana such an arrangement might ultimately work out OK, but why chance it.  There are plenty of abandoned or orphaned Mexican, white, or Asian kids waiting hopefully for adoption who could grow up without vicious peer pressure from other kids.  I know a couple of families who have adopted East Asian kids without any problems whatever for the children, who also seem to excel academically and appear truly grateful for their incorporation into a loving white family. Again, the problem wouldn&rsquo;t arise from the adoptive family or from the child brought into a loving middle class environment.  It would come from other race-hustling blacks.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t for a minute believe that guy men don&rsquo;t want to adopt boys.  Not for a minute.<br/>
The whole reason they are pushing to be allowed to adopt as a &#8220;couple&#8221; or single parent is so they can get boys to first molest, then to turn into sick twisted confused homosexuals like themselves.  Period.  </p>

		<p>By the way, has anyone noticed that the notion of not having children to save the planet has re-surfaced? I&rsquo;ve seen two different morons talking about it on cable news this past week. In the background they were showing video of White babies. Also saw an article about it in a sociology magazine this week when I was taking my break at work. </p>
<p>This was around in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s, you know Earth Day and all that. So, who didn&rsquo;t have children? Whites, of course.  The rest of the world ignored it and just kept reproducing.</p>
<p>Now the liberals are at it again. I pray that Whites don&rsquo;t buy it this time.    </p>

<p>Black children aren&rsquo;t just a liability,and this is true for both sexes,although the odds of procuring a well behaved black girl are-I&rsquo;d imagine-slightly better than the odds of the same happening with a black male. Black males are a clear and present-if not not exactly quantifiable-danger.</p>
<p>When that black male hits puberty and the testosterone kicks in,the white family stupid enough to adopt in the first place will face a very real possibility of being raped,and stabbed,shot,strangled,or otherwise done in,and maybe even in a manner that&rsquo;s creative enough,or spectacular enough to warrant a couple of minutes on the local evening news. What a memorial.</p>
<p>Even if the kid doesn&rsquo;t chimp out and murder his benefactors in their beds one night,the adoptive couple will still face approximately a one in three chance of the youf being behind bars at some point. Beat those odds and the kid will still probably never be smart enough to go to school,get a degree,and become anything but a government employee,and that&rsquo;s the smart ones.</p>
<p>And who wants to volunteer to try to get a 14 year old black youth to try to mow the lawn when it&rsquo;s his turn? Best of luck&hellip;</p>

		<p>From what I understand, among African Americans, girls are preferrred and especially light skinned children are often adopted over darker skinned children. One reason I heard why boys are not adopted is because of the fear that boys may be shot and killed which is often the fate of young black men.</p>

		<p>If a non-black couple adopts an African-American infant or child, one day (and this day will come) an African-American will approach the couple and inform them how they will premaritally scar the child for not raising the child with a through knowledge of African/African-American history and sense of their &#8220;black self&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some social worker-type will accuse that the child will grow up &#8220;too white&#8221; and not understand their &#8220;blackness&#8221; and eventually will confess that a black couple could do a better job of raising the child.</p>

		<p>Adoptive parents in the USA have ALWAYS preferred girls to boys, going back to at least the 1920s/1930s.  People back in the olden days thought that &#8220;nervousness&#8221; was strongly related to women&rsquo;s inability to conceive, so if they adopted a child, the mother might relax and get pregnant.  Their fantasy was that they would adopt a girl, and then have a biological boy a year or two later.  </p>
<p>These days, I would say that the big preference for girls is related to the fact that by the time people get around to adopting, and have enough money saved to go through with an adoption, they are very likely to be in their late 30s to mid-40s.  At that point, they often want to have one or two daughters, and feel too old to chase after a boy.  Also, women are often the driving force behind the adoption, with the husbands being more willing to remain childless.  Single women who adopted used to be offered nothing but girls, but the shortage of adoptable girls has caused that rule to be relaxed.</p>
<p>People who adopt a child of another race have to deal with the fact that their adoption is highly visible to the most casual observer, with other people often butting in with their opinions about transracial/transnational adoption, etc.  Blacks are often very hostile to the idea of whitey adopting black children, and see the surplus of adoptable black children as an embarrassment to the black community.  Hispanics probably feel the same way.  Many white adoptive parents insist on adopting white children simply because they are very private people, and don&rsquo;t want to be accosted by strangers at the supermarket who would then proceed to pump them for intimate details of their lives.  (&#8220;Is your baby from Korea?  What agency did you use?  How much did your baby cost?&#8221;) </p>
<p>It used to be that most white babies placed for adoption were the babies of unwed teenaged girls.  Now, most of the white babies that are available are the offspring of women who are already raising children.  They are divorced, and trying to work full time or go back to school, and they will have to go back on welfare if they have a new baby.  As a group, the black babies are coming from less advantageous backgrounds, with a lot of prematurity, prenatal substance abuse and exposure to venereal disease, ZERO prenatal care, and much more.  There are a hundred reasons for whites to prefer to adopt white children, and all of the reasons are valid.</p>

		<p>White couples PREFER non-Black children? No surprise. We flirted with the idea of adopting once. The Catholic agency was only too happy to produce a number of half-Black/half White kids to be adopted. One look was enough. We told the officals in no uncertain terms&hellip; White or None! The officials were properly aghast and we heard no more from them after that dismal encounter.</p>
<p>Reality is that very few people are going to emulate Madonna and pick the perfect Black accessory to pose for the media with. Let Madonnq adopt Blacks&hellip; and welcome! Adopt a Black (or even half-Black) kid? THANKS but NO THANKS!</p>

Maybe we can also get her Social Worker mother to do the same, since they are so worried about those &#8220;youths&#8221;. If someone in Philly can go to the charity that is being held for her to raise money for her medical bills and give her a copy of this article and suggest that she adopt one of her attackers, this may soothe her poor worried soul.</p>

<p>Be so harsh? What is &#8220;harsh&#8221; about saving one&rsquo;s own race? When a White adopts a nonwhite that child is brought into a White neighborhood, school and church for the most part. They will play with White girls and boys and they will end up as another bleeding heart liberal with black &#8220;friends&#8221;. No less, dating and cohabitating with them also. The adoptee parents most certainly are brainwashed and self-hating Whites to begin with and deserve no sympathy or support from the White community. Either we want to save our race or we don&rsquo;t. There is no in-between wishy washy ideaology allowed, period.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among single, liberal, educated, economically well off white women there seems to be a leaning toward the adoption of black baby boys, but this is just my unscientific observation. </p>
<p>Black boys can grow into threatening adults, who will be throwing their weight around by their teenage years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your post reminds me of something I once witnessed, back in 1999.  At a park, three teenaged white girls seemed to be baby sitting a black boy that seemed to be about 4 years old.  He was in opened rebellion.  They tried to hold him and coddle him, coo, talk baby to him, but no matter what they did, he struggled free, yelled and kicked and hit at them.  They just went on and on, while he showed nothing but distain and rebellion.  There was no other blacks or obvious parent anywhere to be seen.  It was still going on when I left. </p>
<p>I am sure the girls thought they were just getting their just deserts.  Every one of their remarks and gestures showed it.<br/>

<p>I beg your pardon, Bill, but I am a gay male with a partner of 25 years and have two adopted girls, one White-Anglo and the other a White Hispanic. I chose girls because girls seem to bond well with their fathers from what I have observed growing up and in other families. My girls are healthy, vibrant and georgeous and they live their dad and his partner, just the same. </p>
<p>Another reason I chose girls is because it won&rsquo;t be as much of a stigma for a girl to have &#8220;two daddies&#8221; as it would a boy. I was very thoughtful and kept that in mind when adopting. </p>
<p>I think what upsets you is that the science of this study has borne out the now-obvious lie that gay men molest young boys. Your bigotry regarding this study tell me that you don&rsquo;t want to believe that this lie really is just that. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a series of novels that are written on the premise that in the future, three Pacific Northwest states break away from the USA and form a new country. In this series of novels, White children can be taken from their families if the parents teach them racial awareness, for using a &#8220;non-inclusive&#8221; (i.e. politically correct) Bible, etc. The children can then be &#8220;adopted&#8221; by anyone with the money to pay an &#8220;adoption bond,&#8221; effectively selling the child into slavery to the highest bidder. White girls bring the highest prices. The incident that sparks the revolution is the stealing of White children from a family by the local Child Protective Service, which has been derisively named &#8220;It Takes A Village&#8221; by the populace. </p>
<p>When I read the novels, then read the newspapers and see stories like this, I see where the author got his inspiration. Let&rsquo;s just see what <i>else</i> the author predicts correctly&hellip;</p>

<p>Oh really? So I suppose when straight men want to adopt girls they all plan to molest them too? I mean they are attracted to females so that must be the reason right? Perhaps in YOUR mind the sexual desire for children is normal, but that is not normal for the vast majority of adults whether they be gay or straight.</p>

<p>You are correct. I have spoken with a number of adoption agencies and they have told me that in the case of White, upscale parents there is a preference for Black girls over Black boys. In fact the percentage is 85 to 15%.</p>
<p>I would argue that they may feel that girls will be easier to raise and will mature quicker than boys. Which all studies show that girls do mature much faster.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, there are not enough adoptable white infants to satisfy the demand by white parents. Most parents want to adopt infants than older children because they do not have the emotional baggage that many older children have after being shuttled through the foster care system. This is why some parents go to countries such as Russia to adopt a white child. Any white parent that is going to adopt an African American or child  of another race is going to make sure that the child&rsquo;s ethnic heritage is celebrated. Korean adoptive parents and their adopted children attend summer camps where the family learns about the Korean culture and language. </p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, there was another post discussing interracial adoptions. A Black woman who was adopted by a White family discussed her experience which according to her was very positive. She seemd to be very successful. She obviously was well-educated given her eloquent speech and command of the language. She was obviously an example where such an adoption was a success.</p>
