			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ken McLaughlin, Mercury News (San Jose), April 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The survey of 1,515 registered voters showed that 67 percent of Californians support a two-pronged approach to solving the illegal immigration problem: implementing stronger enforcement at the border while setting up a legalization path for undocumented immigrants who admit they broke the law, perform community service, learn English and pay fines and back taxes.</p>
<p>Seventy percent favor stricter border controls and a temporary worker program that does not grant illegal immigrants citizenship and requires them to return to their homeland. But only 45 percent favor denying the undocumented an education and taxpayer-funded health and social services.</p>
<p>Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, said the poll  &mdash;  sponsored by the Los Angeles Times and USC&rsquo;s College of Letters, Arts and Sciences  &mdash;  showed there was a &#8220;sea change&#8221; in Californians&rsquo; attitudes toward illegal immigration since 1994. That&rsquo;s when 59 percent of the state&rsquo;s voters cast a ballot in favor of Proposition 187, the white-hot measure aimed at denying services to illegal immigrants. The proposition was later ruled unconstitutional by federal courts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One big reason for the change: Younger voters are less likely to favor cutting off services to the undocumented, Schnur said. In addition, the number of Latino voters has substantially increased since 1994.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Yeh Ling-Ling, executive director of the Orinda-based Alliance for a Sustainable USA, a group that wants to see more restrictions on immigration, said the poll&rsquo;s results are deceptive and will turn around once Californians begin paying attention to the renewed debate in Congress, expected later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody ever told the people surveyed that amnesty will lead to an explosion of both legal and illegal immigration as newly naturalized citizens bring in their extended families,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other results included:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Belying the &#8220;common wisdom&#8221; that most Republican primary voters hunger for a red-meat conservative candidate, 44 percent of likely GOP voters said they preferred a &#8220;centrist&#8221;; 45 percent preferred a &#8220;strong conservative.&#8221; The difference is statistically insignificant.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s contradictory, because if you tell everyone that you&rsquo;re allowed to come on in, then what point is there to border security?  That&rsquo;s like putting a better dead bolt lock on your front door, then leaving it open all the time.</p>

		<p>When I saw this observation, I knew that the reason for it was that the number of idiots trying to hold the door open to hordes of illegals has finally exceeded the number of us trying to hold it closed.The reason for this is because of the larger number of Mexicans, the Great and Glorious Master Race of Mexico.For this we can thank all of the white race traitors who want unlimited illegal immigration.</p>

<p>This is what makes me sick, honestly, to very marrow of my bones!</p>
<p>You cannot have it both ways; it is a question of national identity versus &ldquo;undocumented enrichments,&rdquo; end of story. The sub-idiotic white freaks in California might beg to differ, but who really cares. They have destroyed their land, as close to a paradise as might actually be obtained, because of their own rainbow &ldquo;openness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is unfathomable madness; now, they wish to halt the flood engulfing them by transferring the Atlantic into the Pacific, with taxed equinity for our country as a whole.</p>
<p>A bit late for that, in the sunny Twilight Zone of CA.</p>

		<p>No serious journalist would use the term &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Immigrant&rsquo; implies someone selected, vetted, and granted conditional entry by an authority with lawful powers. </p>
<p>There are illegal trespassers, illegal criminals, and illegal invaders, but no such thing as an &#8216;illegal immigrant&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>This is just another attempt to make illegals legal. Pro amnesty forces know they can&rsquo;t win outright so they&rsquo;re throwing the electorate a bone. They&rsquo;re proposing a compromise hoping the opposition will offer their compromise. This is just a trick to make anti-immigration activists feel as if they&rsquo;re involved in making a choice but the any action in PRO illegals.<br>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put any stock in this poll.</p>
<p>My guess is if 45% oppose giving benefits, then probably only 25 or so support giving and the rest are undecided.</p>
<p>As with the amnesty poll, they often work like this &#8220;Do you deporting every undocumented workers&#8221; and &#8220;Do you support making illegal aliens pay taxes, go to the back of the line, not commit crimes, learn english&hellip;oh and by the way get some sort of legal status that does not result in citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>When given the option of amnesty, amnesty with strings, enforcement of employer sanction laws, or deportations.  Usually about 70% pick deportation/sanctions.  </p>

		<p>I would not put much credence in this study; both the L.A. Times and USC are extreme far left liberal-oriented, and so the survey is bound to have been biased.  The L.A. Times is the little sister of the NY Times. USC is located smack in the middle of the downtown L.A. black ghetto, which has now become a ghetto of Hispanics and blacks.  Bottom line, it ain&rsquo;t a place where you want your white self to be after dark.  I would ignore this piece of info - it&rsquo;s just propaganda for the illegals, and for the rest of us it&rsquo;s pure nonsense.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the lethal loophole, right there!  (And not the only one.)  There&rsquo;s the fatal flaw that will undermine the best of plans.  The world has learned by now that &#8220;guest workers&#8221; do not go home, that &#8220;temporary workers&#8221; are not temporary.   Need we go through this again?  Have we learned nothing?   Despite all initial promises and plans, it doesn&rsquo;t work out that way. They settle in and stay.  And then they have babies!   Lots of &#8216;em!   Employers eventually get &#8220;hooked&#8221; on them and won&rsquo;t give them up.  And (unless the anchor-baby laws are changed)  after another 20-some years, their grown children will be voting for more amnesty  for their relatives, and demanding that more of their ethnic paisanos be let in.  It never stops!   We saw the very same thing with the Reagan amnesty in &#8216;87.  It&rsquo;s  déjà  vu.</p>
<p>I know I have said it before, forgive me, but the only solution is to DO ALL OF OUR OWN WORK OURSELVES.  Do not become dependent on cheap foreign labor!  Cheap foreign labor is the fatal pill that will kill the country. </p>
<p>Let other lands keep their cheap labor at home and use it to build up their own countries, instead of flooding us with it.   We don&rsquo;t want it!   And with over 300 million human beings currently crammed within these crumbling borders, there&rsquo;s no reason we should need it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of hearing they will pay back taxes, pay fines and do community service. English is very difficult to learn, especially for the masses who are largely illeterate in their own language. And how do you calculate what they owe in taxes when they are paid off the books. These feel good and sound good proposals cannot and never will be put in place or enforced. And that&rsquo;s obvious to anyone capable of even mildly rational thought. Send all the illegals the Hell back to where they came from. That&rsquo;s the answer. Period. </p>

<p>Maybe this is why California is bankrupt? Also, the California universities have been hit hard by the budget crunch. They&rsquo;ve had to raise tuition and fees and a lot of students are pissed off about it. The same students who would support extending education and services to criminal aliens. Yeah, well, they&rsquo;ve only themselves to blame.</p>

<p>I am not surprised.</p>
<p>Productive Whites and businesses have been fleeing this state in droves for two decades now, driven out by satanic taxes, wretched schools, exorbitant energy costs, onerous regulations and fees imposed by the communists in the legislature who continue to promote open borders and higher taxes  &mdash;  without understanding that businesses, the &#8216;wealthy&rsquo; and other taxpayers are mobile, pack up and leave, take their wealth and business with them rather than hand it over to the state.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, hoards of non-productive, welfare-draining parasites have moved into the state, replacing the producers, coming here to join the entitlement gravy train and ruin the quality of life.</p>
<p>California is in deep fiscal trouble, as Rush reported today:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa says all city departments except police, public safety and those that make money must close two days a week because of a budget crisis.  They&rsquo;re outta cash&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; three California pensions are underfunded by a total of $550 billion.  That is over a half a trillion.   They don&rsquo;t have the money&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This includes STRS, California teachers retirement system into which I have been paying 8% of my salary for over two decades now.</p>
<p>BTW:  We teachers in California DO NOT retire with 90% of our salaries at age 50.  The average retired teacher&rsquo;s STRS monthly benefit is $2448 &mdash; less than $30,000 per year .  Hardly a golden parachute. </p>

		<p>Any poll from any University will be biased.  Young people vote for services to illegals because they do not yet pay taxes.  The truth is US immigration laws have not been kept since Eisenhower. The DNC has included illegal aliens as part of their platform to dilute votes of US citizens. With help of CA judge who overturned the votes of the people of CA and with the help of decades of neglect the US politicians have successfully replaced the heritage of USA with foreign borns.  Let&rsquo;s see how they like paying all the taxes to fund even more invasions.  Either US will succumb to poverty state to please the DNC or there will be backlash against the policies that brought US here.  V</p>

		<p>The point in time is arriving -very quickly-where California and other majority nonwhite states will determine their imigration policy accelerating the racial transformation of these states.</p>
<p>Hispanics are openly raciall in their politics. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother Mark Krikorian over at CIS. In fact Mark Krikorian openly praises Cecelia Munoz former head of THE RACE.</p>

<p>It seems that the next step, or somewhere down the road anyway, if the &#8220;communists in the legislature&#8221; get their way, will be to do as the Iron Curtain countries once did&hellip;  and FORBID anyone to leave.   That&rsquo;s what it will come to.  They will have to find some way to KEEP you there, to force you to continue producing for them, and PREVENT you from leaving and taking your productivity and your tax money with you. They can&rsquo;t allow you to get away.</p>
<p>They obviously can&rsquo;t tolerate this drain to continue.  It&rsquo;s not far fetched!  The new totalitarians who are increasingly in control have no regard, within their Trotskyist ideology,  for standard Western liberties and would do whatever is necessary to achieve their ends    &mdash;   the ends justifying the means. As they say, &#8220;by any means necessary&#8221;.  They mean it!   It&rsquo;s a chilling thought.  Did we win the Cold War only to have it come here? Did we think we were saving our children, only to have them capture our grandchildren? </p>

<p>While California just very well can&rsquo;t put up a wall around its borders to prevent taxpayers from leaving, I think I know how they&rsquo;ll, as you say &#8220;keep you there, force you to continue producing for them, and prevent you from&hellip;taking your productivity and tax money with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh moved out of New York City and to Florida in 1997, and took his show with him.  NYC has high income taxes, Florida has no income tax.  However, Rush says that every year, like clockwork, he gets audited by the New York State tax authority, because they&rsquo;re using every pretense to find some &#8220;work&#8221; he did in New York State that&rsquo;s subject to state income taxes.  The last time he relayed this story, he said that just the fact that his show, even though it&rsquo;s done in Florida, is routed through Manhattan on its way to the satellite, is being used as grounds by the NY State taxers as the way that Rush is &#8220;working&#8221; in the state.  It&rsquo;s not that they are succeeding; after all, Rush has the money to defend himself.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how cash-starved California is going to put up a &#8220;Berlin Wall,&#8221; of sorts.  Not by putting up a literal wall, but by having its state tax authority harass all those ex-Calfornians in Arizona and Oregon and Nevada to find some sort of long-arm pretense to collect state income taxes from them.  And, since many of those people aren&rsquo;t multi-millionaires, and can&rsquo;t defend themselves like Rush has, they&rsquo;ll throw a bone to the dogs to keep the dogs from biting them.  If they seek relief in the Federal judiciary, they&rsquo;ll turn them away, b/c all the Federal judges pretty soon will be Obama appointees, and California&rsquo;s a blue state.  CA is a half terabuck in hock for future obligations for pensions and health care benefits to public employee union members, and they&rsquo;re all Democrats and Obamaites.  Will a Federal judge that a AFSCME-endorsed U.S. President appoint tell an ex-Californian that he doesn&rsquo;t have to pay CA taxes for retired AFSCME members to have a pension?  </p>

<p>Thank you.   Very good point!   You illustrate exactly what I meant.   As I said, I can&rsquo;t imagine how it will work out, but they will find SOME way. They will HAVE TO,  if they are to feed and care for all those non-productive millions. </p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t have a literal Berlin Wall, and the bureaucratic structure isn&rsquo;t place yet, but little by little they will build the apparatus necessary to put it into effect.  Who can yet imagine what it will be?  It may well be as you speculate, or they may impose a tax on remittances out of the state (as for pensions),  or an exit tax for those who sell their real estate and move, or who transfer bank balances, or who sell businesses.  (Yes, the federal govt. can always intervene, but will they?  Interstate commerce laws can be changed. Nothing is written in stone.)  California, after all, is a huge state.  It  has enough clout to bully Washington or to  strong-arm a small neighboring  state such as Nevada to   levy an entry tax for new residents, for instance.   Nevada receives a tremendous among of tourism and income from California.   Calif. could threaten to somehow  tax or impede that vital tourist flow;  or Calif. could threaten to legalize gambling in its  areas adjacent to Nevada, thus striking a deadly blow that Nevada can&rsquo;t afford.  </p>
<p>My point is that ANYTHING is possible.   All options are open.  There are infinite devices that I am sure California will start to explore when they get desperate enough.   And other cash-strapped  places like Detroit will learn from them.    Those fleeing whites, if they can&rsquo;t be stopped outright,  will have to fleeced before they get away.  The same formula, btw,  could be used for stopping &#8220;white flight&#8221; anywhere in the country&hellip; even for those moving to another school district or county. When the well dries up, we will see the mitts come off and desperate cities, counties, and states will get really inventive.   Get ready for it.</p>

<p>For years, California had a &#8220;source tax,&#8221; wherein pension funds that left the state had money deducted from them. Some sort of &#8220;we administer the fund here, so we&rsquo;re going to tax it&#8221; <b>b</b>ravo <b>s</b>ierra. It finally got overturned a few years back. But the bunch of New Communists in Sacramento could try to re-implement it at any time.</p>

<p>Thinking out loud here, I think the simple and obvious angle CA would try is sticking its hand out to the Yankee government.  The flaw in that, again thinking out loud, is that CA is already reliably blue in terms of Presidential politics, so a Democrat President can take it for granted, and a Republican (presumably a non-stupid one, those are hard to find) can write it off as unwinable.  (But Gerald Ford did eventually bail out NYC, in spite of its perpetual blueness.)  Maybe the Democrat Congressional delegation from CA (Pelosi is Speaker for now) can wield a big stick.  </p>

		<p>Even without amnesty, and a full repatriation of illegals to their respective countries, the illegal&rsquo;s anchor babies/children and their offspring, with their incredible birth rates, will eventually become the majority in this fading republic. The result will be massive discrimination and violence against anyone other than themselves. Think South Africa. If you think things are bad now, just wait another 20-30 years. Reconquista, indeed.</p>

Why do only we see this?  And just imagine it in another fifty! Or think one hundred!</p>
<p>It seems the ruling capitalist powers are so ignorant of history, as well as so greedy and short-sighted that they cannnot see that far ahead (think Bushesm for example).   And if they do try to think that far ahead, they cannot conceive of any situation where they will not be riding above the fray and still in charge (think Bushes again). </p>
<p>Other (farther-sighted) elements may not plan to remain here at all when the USA finally crashes and they have cleaned out the till for all they can get and have absconded.</p>

		<p>27 voter: Maybe the &#8220;far sighted elements&#8221; you write of will marry Oriental women and move to Singapore or Hong Kong.  They&rsquo;ll have their money and will laugh at us, until their new country-of-convenience sees that the U.S. can&rsquo;t protect its people anymore and seizes their assets.  </p>
