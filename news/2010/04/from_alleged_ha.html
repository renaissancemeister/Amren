			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elie Mystal, Above the Law, April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before he was a 1L at the University of Toledo College of Law, Kyle Bristow was the chairman of the Young Americans for Freedom student chapter at Michigan State University. During his leadership, the MSU-YAF chapter became the first student organization designated as a &#8220;hate group&#8221; by the Southern Poverty Law Center. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We spoke with Bristow about the concerns raised by some of the Toledo College of Law students. He had this to say to Above the Law: <blockquote>Pursuant to my lawyer&rsquo;s advice, this is my official statement for your article: &#8220;I refuse to dignify with a response the baseless allegations made against me by various left-wing University of Toledo College of Law students. I am in the process of retaining legal counsel to deal with the defamatory accusations made against me by them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cordially,</p>
<p>Kyle Bristow<br>
</blockquote>Should Bristow&rsquo;s past associations even matter? He&rsquo;s no longer the chairman of the MSU-YAF chapter (although a comment that he apparently left on this post about a controversial YAF video game suggests he still keeps himself apprised of YAF activities).</p>
<p>We spoke with the Toledo College of Law Dean for Academic Affairs, Daniel Steinbock. Dean Steinbock stated clearly that the protected speech of Bristow  &mdash;  or any other Toledo Law applicant  &mdash;  would not affect admissions decisions:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Remember, Bristow is in a different situation than that of former UVA Law admitted student Marcus Epstein. In that case, Epstein was actually convicted of a crime (which some characterized as a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;). Here, Bristow was merely the chairman of a so-called &#8220;hate group,&#8221; as defined by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a private organization.</p>
<p>After we started digging around about Kyle Bristow, the law school decided to communicate directly with its students about the situation. A source reports that the College of Law has taken special note of Bristow in the past 24 hours:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We have seen some of the Facebook screenshots in question. In one thread, Bristow seems to praise Bernard Goetz, apparently quoting Goetz&rsquo;s statements that &#8220;[s]ociety is better off without certain people&#8221; and that &#8220;whether one believes they should be killed or locked up or used for forced slavery  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s a matter of one&rsquo;s political point of view.&#8221; Another status update explains that Bristow was rooting for Duke in the NCAA tournament because it was the &#8220;last white basketball team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toledo&rsquo;s Associate Dean of Student Affairs, Lee Pizzimenti, sent out this school-wide email today: <blockquote>I write to remind you that things you publish on the web, including on your facebook page, may be found and can create character and fitness issues for you when you apply to take the bar. In addition, employers increasingly are searching for information, and pictures or text you post may discourage them from hiring you.</p>
<p>I have attached an article describing some cases raising character and fitness issues. I urge you to consider this as you decide what to post. It should be noted that you should not assume because it&rsquo;s on a private part of your page that it can&rsquo;t be found.</p>
<p>Lee A. Pizzimenti<br>
</blockquote>Do minority and/or LGBT students have any reason to be worried about their campus safety because of Bristow&rsquo;s past? Dean Daniel Steinbock sees no cause for concern:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It looks like Toledo College law students are getting a very practical lesson in free speech during their 1L year.<br>

		<p>The most compassionate thing the University of Toledo law school could do for this poor kid would be to kick him out of school now.  No one in this God-forsaken, PC, moribund profession is ever going to hire him.  Its well nigh impossible for any grad of low-ranked schools like that to get a job in this economy, let alone one that doesn&rsquo;t toe the official PC party line.  That&rsquo;s even assuming he passes his character and fitness check.</p>

		<p>I would say young Kyle has got it right, it&rsquo;s past time to fight fire with fire and start hauling the likes of the SPLC into a court of law and make them prove their charges. Lawsuits are of course a weapon that Mo Dees and his henchman love to use against people with whom they disagree with and to silence them. Once again, it is time to make these race-hustling frauds prove their charges in a court of law.</p>

		<p>If the SPLC doesn&rsquo;t like you, chances are you&rsquo;re an upstanding citizen with excellent moral groundings.</p>
<p>They just put in groups such as the Nation of Islam and Black Panthers to throw people off from the fact that 90% of the groups they list are in no way, shape, or form, &#8220;hate groups.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think Dean Steinbock played it very smart.  The last person any state college academic would want to hear from would be the Governor of the state, and Steinbock may well have heard from him.</p>

		<p>Virtually every state requires an applicant to the State Bar to submit a mountain of personal information to a committee, so that the committee can weigh the applicant&rsquo;s &#8220;fitness&#8221; to practice law in the State. The criteria for &#8220;fitness&#8221; are wildly subjective, and I suspect that espouing policital views deemed &#8220;controversial&#8221; by the committee would impact its decision. Thus, even if Bristow passes the Bar Exam, he might find it difficult to be admitted to practice. </p>
<p>I agree with the earlier post that says the kid would be better off if he was expelled from school. Law school doesn&rsquo;t teach anyone to think logically; it deconstructs what we believe to be logical, and reprograms the mind to work illogically and unnaturally. Lawyers are natural bureaucrats, sycophants, and overall, are exceedingly inhumane. In fact, I feel dirty when I have to admit that I am a lawyer - the legal profession deserves every derision heaped upon it by the general public, and then some. </p>

		<p>He is probably screwed.  You don&rsquo;t automatically get to be a lawyer just because you pass the Bar, most states you have to grovel and humble yourself before a &#8220;character and fitness&#8221; committee and explain any criminal record, financial problems etc. Of course being part of a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; group is probably about the worst possible thing.</p>
<p>They will probably let him slog his way through three years of law school, let him accrue $100,000 or so in student loans, let him study for months to pass the Bar Exam and then tell him he is unsuited for the legal profession due to his extremist views which contradict the Bar Associations goals of diversity, tolerance blah blah blah&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>The activities of $PLC, as far as they can be  <br>
r e a s o n a b l y  discerned,  should be catalogued by some<br>
responsible and able organization set up specifically for this purpose. There is troubling indication that $PLC has grown into a huge intelligence gathering, &#8220;intelligence&#8221; creating, and intelligence disseminating entity reaching into many, perhaps most, local law enforcement agencies and apparently having &#8220;footsie&#8221; trade off relationships with at least some, if not most,  FBI/ATF  Field Offices. If fact $PLC appears now to have arrived at the $tatu$ of a para-world of unauthorized law enforcement and is running amok, its power progressively increasing.         </p>

<p>And no digging around about the hate-group known as the SPLC?</p>
<p>This is the heart of the issue: who in society gets to point the finger at others, and is never questioned about their self-serving motives?</p>
<p>Why should the SPLC continue to get a free pass?</p>

		<p>10 aj is on to something.  I have a worthless relative who had no business being in grad school as he has no interest in serious thinking.  But they let him take the classes and run up a lot of debt before they cut him off.  He is actually paying for somebody else&rsquo;s education.  </p>
