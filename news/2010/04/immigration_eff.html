			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, April 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As President Obama and Senate Democrats push to pass an immigration bill this year, one key ingredient is still conspicuously missing: a second Republican to co-sponsor the legislation.</p>
<p>Most Republicans considered likeliest to join Sens. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, in writing a bill either have taken a pass or are still on the fence. Key figures say the country does not have the kind of consensus needed to tackle the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore,&#8221; said Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who in 2007 took the lead on writing a bill with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Massachusetts Democrat, only to see it fail when a bipartisan majority of senators joined a filibuster against it.</p>
<p>Mr. Schumer and Mr. Graham are guardedly pressing ahead with a bill that would legalize illegal immigrants, establish a new system for allowing in foreign workers, and tighten controls on employment, including requiring the use of biometric identification Social Security cards.</p>
<p>Mr. Schumer sees a path for a bill, Mr. Graham sounds uncertain, and both of them are looking to Mr. Obama to help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, has indicated that he wants the Senate to act on the immigration issue this year. Although solid bipartisan sponsorship is not required, it has been the goal for every other immigration bill.</p>
<p>Mr. Schumer said that if backers can find a second Republican, the other pieces of the puzzle will fall into place.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who supported immigration bills in 2006 and 2007, was an early focus for Democrats. He said Mr. Schumer approached him last year to ask him if he was interested in joining forces, but Mr. Lugar declined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Former Sen. Mel Martinez, Florida Republican, would have been an obvious choice. As a Cuban immigrant, he was outspoken in calling on his party to embrace legalization and was a key author of the 2006 bill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several news reports said Mr. Schumer is hoping that Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, would be willing to join forces. Mr. Cornyn is the ranking Republican on the immigration subcommittee on which Mr. Schumer serves as chairman.</p>
<p>Mr. Cornyn wrote his own immigration proposal along with Mr. Kyl several years ago but did not join the 2007 efforts. Mr. Cornyn, who as a Texan has a close view of border issues, is also chairman of Senate Republicans&rsquo; campaign committee, and signing on to an immigration bill could hurt his efforts there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Texas&rsquo; other Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison, is also not co-sponsoring the legislation, according to her senior legislative adviser.</p>
<p>It likely will be easier for Mr. Schumer to find a Democrat to co-sponsor his legislation. Sen. Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat, has been mentioned.<br>

		<p>Perhaps the reason there isn&rsquo;t a second backer for the &#8220;immigration bill&#8221;, is because that person would immediately be ruined politically, as they should be.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Mr. Schumer said that if backers can find a second Republican, the other pieces of the puzzle will fall into place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, there is reason enough for any Republican to treat this legislation as pure political poison. Anything that Comrade Schumer backs, must be both high treason and anti-human. I wish you well in hell, Comrade Graham.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Schumer and Mr. Graham are guardedly pressing ahead with a bill that would legalize illegal immigrants, establish a new system for allowing in foreign workers, and tighten controls on employment, including requiring the use of biometric identification Social Security cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usual idiocy.</p>
<p>One wonders, in a time of high unemployment, why legislation is needed to allow more &ldquo;foreign workers&rdquo; in, but also seeks to &ldquo;tighten controls on employment?&rdquo; Seems oddly like expecting a cat not to defecate on your carpet, once you have latched its litter box shut.  Or perhaps, honestly believing that 2+2 really can equal 5.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Amnesty to illegals is a career-killer just like the healthcare bill was.  I say if somebody wants to be dumb enough to sponsor such a bill, let&rsquo;em.  They&rsquo;ll be out to pasture come the next election, and deservedly so.</p>

		<p>Graham&rsquo;s a real piece of work.  God willing, my fellow South Carolinians will come to their senses and vote this RINO out of office at the next opportunity.</p>

		<p>I almost wish the republicans would push for amnesty.  The states would flat out revolt.</p>

<p>What part of &#8220;we don&rsquo;t want any amnesty OR immigration&#8221; do these people not understand? The only ones who want it are the illegals and those stOOpid White politicians that think because of their pandering, the hispanics will keep them in office. We all here know that, like muslims, as soon as they have the numbers to do so, they will vote in their own kind and THEN the pogrom against Whites and non muslims will begin. Michigan is called michiGANISTAN by troops over here from that state!!!</p>

<p>Vote FOR Amnesty&hellip; and commit political suicide? YOUR DECISION! (Also watch your political party pay the price.)</p>

		<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yb79wk7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yb79wk7</a>  &ldquo;Hernandez who has no less than 12 aliases and two dates of birth, has been arrested 19 times since 2003. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation also confirmed that Hernandez had been arrested by nine different police departments. Despite his lengthy arrest record and illegal status in this country, Hernandez has never been deported nor have deportation proceedings ever been started against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I charge the president and congress as accessories before the fact in the deaths of this child and two adults at the hands of a Hispanic illegal alien.  </p>
<p>In the 9/11 terrorist attack Muslims murdered around three thousand American Christians and Jews.  </p>
<p>However, over five thousand Americans die every year at the hands of Hispanic illegal aliens. </p>
<p>We should wage war on Mexico and central America since Hispanic illegal aliens kill a far greater number of Americans every year than Al-Qaeda&hellip;</p>
