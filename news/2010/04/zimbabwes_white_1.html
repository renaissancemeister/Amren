			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peta Thornycroft and Sebastien Bergerr, London Telegraph, March 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White Zimbabwean farmers whose land was grabbed by Robert Mugabe plan to turn the tables by seizing Zimbabwean-owned property in South Africa.</p>
<p>Lawyers for dispossessed farmers believe that on Monday they will be able to start using the law to seize houses in Cape Town which are owned by the Zimbabwean government. Their action, which follows a landmark legal ruling, promises to humiliate Mr Mugabe and embarrass South Africa&rsquo;s president Jacob Zuma, who was on a state visit to Britain last week.</p>
<p>The battle for justice fought by one of the white farmers, Mike Campbell, aged 77, was featured in the documentary film Mugabe and the White African. It was shown in British cinemas this year to great acclaim.</p>
<p>The film tells how he fought stubbornly to bring a legal case in 2008 against Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s government at the Southern African Development Community tribunal, based in the Namibian capital Windhoek.</p>
<p>Mr Campbell won a victory when the court ruled that Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s farm takeovers were racist in nature and therefore illegal.</p>
<p>At the North Gauteng High Court in the South African capital Pretoria last month, the farmers successfully applied for the Namibian judgement to be enforced in South Africa.</p>
<p>Lawyers acting for the Mr Campbell and a group of other farmers believe after that ruling they can seize Zimbabwean government-owned property, to recover legal costs from the South African case.</p>
<p>Mr Campbell, who was severely beaten by land invaders in 2008, was too frail to comment yesterday. But his son-in-law Ben Freeth, 41, said: &#8220;This is not about revenge. This is about the long arm of the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope to expand our actions further and investigate whether we can, in time, sue individuals who were responsible for what has been going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Late last year Mr Freeth watched helplessly as thugs burned down his farmhouse in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Their representatives have identified at least 11 properties which are owned by the government of Zimbabwe, including houses in Cape Town worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Unlike properties in Pretoria which are connected to the embassy, the Cape Town properties are thought not to be protected by diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p>The lawyers say it will be a groundbreaking development, as they are not aware of any precedent for government-owned properties being seized in pursuit of a civil judgement.</p>
<p>The timing is awkward for Mr Zuma. This week the South African president called for Western sanctions to be lifted against Mr Mugabe and his cronies, during a state visit to Britain. The EU recently renewed sanctions for another year, although Western officials point out the sanctions hit only only specific regime members rather than the Zimbabwean people as a whole.</p>
<p>The former opposition Movement for Democratic Change went into a coalition with Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s Zanu-PF party just over a year ago, but the agreement has been beset by difficulties. At one point the MDC boycotted cabinet meetings for several weeks, blaming obstructionism by Zanu-PF.</p>
<p>In the meantime seizures of white-owned farms have continued.</p>
<p>The SADC tribunal has yet to set an amount to be paid in compensation, but the lawyers say they are already able to seek the seizures to recover costs in connection with the court hearing in South Africa, estimated at about Â£12,000.</p>
<p>Willie Spies, the lead South African lawyer in the case, said it would be almost impossible for the Zimbabwean government to appeal against the seizures as it had not contested the North Gauteng court ruling.</p>
<p>The South African government was not a party to the proceedings, he added, and while technically it could apply for judicial review it would be in a &#8220;moral predicament&#8221; if it tried to do so, as in a separate case last year it had formally agreed to &#8220;honour and uphold&#8221; the SADC tribunal verdict.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be a very interesting test for the independence of our sheriffs and for the South African government,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The ruling has not been enforceable in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Senior Zanu-PF officials have sought to dismiss the significance of the legal proceedings. They have claimed that the SADC tribunal did not have jurisdiction over Zimbabwe, even though the nation is a member of the organisation and government lawyers appeared in court to defend it.</p>
<p>At the time of the SADC tribunal ruling, the then minister of lands, Didymus Mutasa, said: &#8220;They are day-dreaming because we are not going to reverse the land reform exercise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Chinamasa, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s justice minister, could not be reached for comment on the latest developments.<br>

		<p>Is there any property in Zimbabwe that the government has seized that it has not already managed to ruin through ineptitude? How many whites are still in Zimbabwe? The country is a lost cause as far as I can see.</p>

		<p>Great   &mdash;   except that it won&rsquo;t be long until the SA &#8220;government&#8221; seizes white-owned farms just as the Mugabe regime has done.</p>

		<p>Nice use of the law to stick-it back to them.  However, we all know that when you match wits with Blacks and you win, you&rsquo;re faced with overwhelming retorts of violence.  Whites and white lawyers are great at bending and finding loopholes in the laws.  The whites will get their laughs, and will then be rounded up and killed by &#8216;rogue mobs&rsquo; or &#8216;angry farm workers&rsquo;, like that white-party leader the other day.  You cannot insult a black&rsquo;s intelligence or prove them wrong without a severe backlash of violence.  God be with them.</p>

		<p>The ANC will in the near future start seizing game farms, it has admitted it recently. In a couple of years, the Kruger National Park will probably be non-existent. The next will be the private houses/properties in the city areas that will be seized. The ANC is a communist regime and communism is all about abolishing private property. The banks and the mines are also on the cards for seizure, although they deny it. You can never trust the &#8220;uncrowned beast of the field&#8221;.</p>

		<p>2) Nonsense, the ANC will simply have &#8220;unaffiliated criminals&#8221; kill white farmers.  Likely over things such as &#8220;wage disputes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think an article released today is very important with regard to the whites in zimbabwe and south africa issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Zuma-condemns-soldiers-protest-20090827" rel="nofollow">https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Zuma-condemns-soldiers-protest-20090827</a></p>
<p>And this is on the side of the border where things haven&rsquo;t totally broken down yet.  In zimbabwe it&rsquo;s far, far worse.</p>
<p>My point is this.  When faced with individual whites, it&rsquo;s easy for a handful of blacks to be sent to beat, rape and murder the white person and terrorize him into submission.</p>
<p>But there are MILLIONS of whites in these two countries.  Although outnumbered, the blacks do not have anything remotely resembling the ability to work togather.  Faced with an actual army, their armed forces would be quickly wiped out (I&rsquo;m being generous here&hellip;..not a single black would stand and fight&hellip;.they would all run away).</p>
<p>If whites would simply gather together in one area, push out the blacks peacefully with refusal to serve, employ and associate with them, and raise a reasonable military of themselves, no nation in africa could challenge them, especially these two countries were they to choose to secceed.</p>
<p>Success or failure would not stand on how aggressive they were with their neighbors.  Actually, a good fences makes good neighbors policy would be the most ideal.  Its&rsquo; success would be guaranteed as long as they held to a strict whites only, no exceptions policy.  They aren&rsquo;t the enemy but they aren&rsquo;t allowed in our country, attitude.</p>
<p>No aid, no trade, no employment.  Little contact and NO immigration, is what would work.</p>
<p>It would be far easier than I think people realize.  That is, if south african whites are at long last ready to admit that a mixed state with them on the top of the food chain (let alone the bottom of the food chain, lol) simply does not work.</p>
