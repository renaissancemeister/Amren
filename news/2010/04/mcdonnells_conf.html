			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anita Kumar and Rosalind S. Helderman, Washington Post, April 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Robert F. McDonnell, reviving a controversy that had been dormant for eight years, has declared that April will be Confederate History Month in Virginia, a move that angered civil rights leaders Tuesday but that political observers said would strengthen his position with his conservative base.</p>
<p>The two previous Democratic governors had refused to issue the mostly symbolic proclamation honoring the soldiers who fought for the South in the Civil War. McDonnell (R) revived a practice started by Republican governor George Allen in 1997. McDonnell left out anti-slavery language that Allen&rsquo;s successor, James S. Gilmore III (R), had included in his proclamation.</p>
<p>McDonnell said Tuesday that the move was designed to promote tourism in the state, which next year will mark the 150th anniversary of the start of the war. McDonnell said he did not include a reference to slavery because &#8220;there were any number of aspects to that conflict between the states. Obviously, it involved slavery. It involved other issues. But I focused on the ones I thought were most significant for Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proclamation was condemned by the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus and the NAACP. Former governor L. Douglas Wilder called it &#8220;mind-boggling to say the least&#8221; that McDonnell did not reference slavery or Virginia&rsquo;s struggle with civil rights in his proclamation. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Confederate history is full of many things that unfortunately are not put forth in a proclamation of this kind nor are they things that anyone wants to celebrate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s one thing to sound a cause of rallying a base. But it&rsquo;s quite another to distort history.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seven-paragraph declaration calls for Virginians to &#8220;understand the sacrifices of the Confederate leaders, soldiers and citizens during the period of the Civil War.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Virginia NAACP and the state&rsquo;s Legislative Black Caucus called the proclamation an insult to a large segment of the state&rsquo;s population, particularly because it never acknowledges slavery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor McDonnell&rsquo;s proclamation was offensive and offered a disturbing revision of the Civil War and the brutal era that followed,&#8221; said Del. Kenneth Cooper Alexander (D-Norfolk), chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus. &#8220;Virginia has worked hard to move beyond the very things for which Governor McDonnell seems nostalgic.&#8221;</p>
<p>King Salim Khalfani, executive director of the Virginia State Conference of the NAACP, said his group will hold an emergency meeting Saturday to discuss a series of problems it has had with McDonnell since he was sworn into office in January.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s proclamation was requested by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. A representative of the group said it has known since it interviewed McDonnell when he was running for attorney general in 2005 that he was likely to respond differently than Warner or Kaine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McDonnell&rsquo;s proclamation comes just before the April 17, 1861, anniversary of the day Virginia seceded from the union.<br>

		<p>Want to shock your semi-educated neighbors? Ask them what the Civil War was fought over. If they say &#8220;slavery&#8221; press the &#8220;wrong answer&#8221; buzzer. Remind them that the South objected to Northern tariffs and that slavery was a secondary issue. That Lincoln&rsquo;s Emancipation Proclamation &#8220;freed&#8221; slaves in states he had no jurisdiction over; that Lincoln offered the South slavery permanently if they would agree not to secede.</p>
<p>Confederate History Month is a teaching opportunity.</p>

		<p>Neither Tim &#8220;King of the Klingons&#8221; Kaine, nor Mark Warner, Governors before McDonnell, both Democrats, declared April as CHM.  The last time it was was the last full year of Jim &#8220;Happy&#8221; Gilmore&rsquo;s time as Governor, and both he and George Allen before him, both Republicans, did declare every April of their tenures as CHM.  Ironic that the Governors of the Party of Lincoln in what was the Confederacy&rsquo;s most important state are the ones that actually care about Confederate history.</p>

<p>Whatcha gonna do, King Salim?  Not endorse the Republican who runs for Governor in 2013?  </p>

		<p>So, is any reference to the WBTS an insult to Whites if it does not mention tariffs?  We Whites get enough Blackophilia, we don&rsquo;t need to drag their issues into everything.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;But it`s quite another thing to distort history&hellip;&#8221;<br>
After visiting the Johnstown Flood memorial and riding the famous Inclined Plane on July 1st my side kick  and I realized we could make Pickett`s charge in nearby Gettysburg on THE day. We got there and it wasn`t as bad as I thought although mini vans and SUV`s were lined up like Union comissary wagons.<br>
  We milled around in Spangler`s  Woods for a few moments as if forming up for the charge. Then we set out across the Wheatfield in the direction of the Split Rail Fence, our objective; the Copse of trees. On our left flank I noticed a group of three hippie types vaugely fumbling with some kind of equipment in their hands. My buddy suddenly cursed loud and long and said, &#8220;They`re smoking Pot!! Smoking weed in the middle of Pickett`s Charge!&#8221; He set off in their direction intending to verbally chastise them for their affront to the time and place of great heroism. As he came almost upon them, words I could not hear were exchanged and to my amazement, my friend raised an imaginary sword over his head as if to urge them on. <br>
  He then walked back to my position with a silly grin on his face. &#8220;What the hell was that all about?!?, I asked. He replied that as he came up to them about to rage he heard the leader calling out in military cadence while they sucked on bongs, &#8220;March! Light, Smoke.. Reload!!  They told him that they had gotten six or seven shots off before reaching the &#8220;High(no pun intended)Water Mark of the Confederacy. He were still chuckling about it lined up behind Johhny Rebs in Butternut and gray at the KFC&hellip;</p>

		<p> A tip of the hat to Gov. McDonnell for issuing the proclamation. It&rsquo;s something that needed to be said, even though it riled up the usual people. But an expression of regret is in order, too, in that he caved in to pressure from those same people and issued the &#8220;amendment&#8221; to the original proclamation about slavery. I suppose he felt he had to, but it&rsquo;s still a shame that he diluted his original message   &mdash;   a little   &mdash;   by doing that.</p>
<p> Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that chip-on-the-shoulder blacks never let us forget slavery, on the one hand; but they want us to forget EVERYTHING about the Confederacy, on the other? I guess they&rsquo;ll keep doing that until they see it isn&rsquo;t working for them any more   &mdash;   which will probably occur when Whites become a minority in our own country. Hispanics sure won&rsquo;t care about &#8220;the legacy of slavery&#8221;!</p>

		<p>The response to McDonnell could be summed up as,</p>
<p> &#8220;Be politically correct and do not hurt overly sensitive people&rsquo;s feelings. Feelings are more important than truthful history. You should spit on your ancestor&rsquo;s memory and listen to what we want you to think.&#8221;</p>

		<p> I have been waiting for a while for a governor to bring back Confederate history month. The last time that it was done, black ministers tried to boycott one mall in Chesterfield county. I wish they would boycott several malls so that there would be less crime there. I would certainly enjoy going to the mall without that criminal element. I love to see the black leaders cringe when there is any celebrations of the Confederacy.<br>

CNN has just reported the governor has issued an apology.</p>
<p>Considering the swiftness of these reversals, I&rsquo;m beginning to believe that these events are nothing but a game where the proponent can issue an apology and then redeem himself by groveling.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe these people are so gutless as to not stand by their convictions.</p>

		<p>As a Confederate-American, I&rsquo;m offended by any attempt to suppress Confederate History Month, Confederate Memorial Day, and any other time set aside to honor those who wore the Grey.  I don&rsquo;t really care what the leftie loonies and their fellow travellers think.  If we let them have their way, they won&rsquo;t stop until all mention of the Confederacy is stifled and all Confederate monuments have been ground to dust. It&rsquo;s the liberals that are rewriting history.  They could use some real education.  Both of my grandfathers were true sons of Confederate soldiers, so don&rsquo;t try to stop my honoring all those gallant men.</p>

		<p>My mind-altering education in the causes and meaning of the War Between The States was the reading of THE REAL LINCOLN: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln and an Unnecessary War by Thomas DiLorenzo, an economic historian at Loyola College of Maryland.  </p>
<p>THE REAL LINCOLN is loaded with such gems as this assessment of The Gettysburg Address by H. L. Menchen:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;let us not forget that it is poetry, not logic; beauty, not sense. Think of the argument in it. Put it into the cold words of everyday. The doctrine is simply this: that the Union soldiers who died at Gettysburg sacrificed their lives to the cause of self-determination   &mdash;  - &lsquo;that government of the people, by the people, for the people,&rsquo; should not perish from the earth. It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Union soldiers in that battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves. What was the practical effect of the battle of Gettysburg? What else than the destruction of the old sovereignty of the States, i.e., of the people of the States? The Confederates went into battle free; they came out with their freedom subject to the supervision and veto of the rest of the country &mdash; and for nearly twenty years that veto was so effective that they enjoyed scarcely more liberty, in the political sense, than so many convicts in the penitentiary.&#8221; </p>

My tip is topic for sure but maybe a help to some. When I was substitute coaching at the Junior High I developed a trick for motivating  surly,sloveny and uncaring fast food workers on my late afternoon off campus lunch break. If they didn`t step forward to take my order I would  first attempt to verbally prompt the &#8220;service encounter.&#8221;<br>
 If they still gave me the big blow off I would pull out my coaches whistle,  and let   fly with  while circling my arm and pointing at them NFL style while shouting &#8220;Service Failure!, Service Failure!&#8221;&hellip; Nine times out of ten it worked like a champ. One  gangster type kid even slid my five back at me while laughing at himself and me out loud&hellip;</p>

I would also point out the draft riots in N.Y.C. during the war; whereby lower class whites refused to go fight to free the slaves. The victor writes the history. That is why we have this particular situation.</p>

		<p>Our forefathers DIED for our land - it WAS &#8220;The War of Northern Aggression&#8221;, remember?  So why should we not have a month dedicated to our war dead?  Blacks have February, we&rsquo;ll take April, that&rsquo;s fine.  But flip the fickle finger of fate at those who would deny us the right to have pride in our past.  Our men were better strategists and fought better than the men of the North; we just didn&rsquo;t have the resources necessary to win in the long run.</p>

<p>I have read that the draft riots in NYC were a response by Irish-Americans at the hypocrisy of the blue-blooded Anglo-Saxon elite that simultaneously funded Adolph Lenin and his invasion of the CSA, an effort that eventually called for drafting young Irish men in order to &#8220;free blacks from slavery,&#8221; while at the same time the same plutocrats owned the factories north of the Mason-Dixon line, chaining Irish children to machinery thereby making them slave laborers.  Amazing thing happens when people latch on to hypocrisy   &mdash;   They get really mad.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they didn&rsquo;t do enough   &mdash;   Lenin&rsquo;s and U.S.eless Grant&rsquo;s &#8220;military strategy&#8221; in the last year or so of the war was to promise starving Irishmen in Ireland (these were the years of the potato famine), redistributed land in exchange for fighting for the enemy.  Of course, they never go that land, because they were almost all killed   &mdash;   U.S.eless Grant&rsquo;s strategy was to continuously pound men on the front lines, because they knew when it came to a urinating match of sacrificing human beings with the Southerners, the Union would win that war, because the Southerners only had so many men to sacrifice, while Ireland had a virtually unlimited supply of vulnerable hungry people to fall sucker to the sales tactics of Lenin and Grant.  Unlike Lee, Jackson and Forrest, none of the Union Generals never had any good minds for strategy.   </p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter to blacks, nor indeed, to a great many whites what real historic fact is..When I was in school and we actually were taught things such as history, geography, math and how to use a PENCIL! I recall no mention of the CW being fought over slavery but for a myriad of other reasons, most of which were economical and the trampling of state&rsquo;s rights of self determination (void where prohibited by law) And I just hate it when a politician make a true statement and then grovels and &#8220;issues an apology&#8221; to the usual suspects for the usual reasons.</p>

		<p>As a Michigan native and Ohio resident, I&rsquo;m a lifelong Yankee, and I see no problem with Confederate History Month.  The South actually fought for freedom.  Not to mention that slaves fought alongside their masters out of loyalty!</p>
<p>Now Lincoln wasn&rsquo;t completely in the wrong.  He wanted to go easy on the South, and he was against the 14th Amendment.  I believe that had he not been assassinated, the South would not have been pillaged by the &#8220;carpetbaggers and scalawags.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any state has the right to secede.  We&rsquo;re no longer a confederation of states, but a corporation, with the states as mere provinces, thanks to the 14th Amendment, which was never really ratified.</p>

    The Union navy won the American Civil War. They prevented the south from getting the weapons they needed. It was only a matter of time before the South collapsed.<br>
    As long as the Navy is strong, The USA is safe.</p>

<p>When we mark Black History Month every February, we should include a proclamation to remind all Americans of the contributions this group makes to our country in the form of murder, rapine, theft, widespread illegitimacy, and destroyed neighborhoods, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s so important to remember ALL of our history.</p>

		<p>AmRen bloggers have shown so much support for Southern Heritage, I won&rsquo;t bother to add to your gracious comments regarding Virginia&rsquo;s Confederate History Month other than to mention that among Lincoln&rsquo;s mercenaries were some 200,000 Colored Troops who ultimately helped tip the scales against the Confederacy.  There&rsquo;s just bound to be some bad blood between the races in the South.</p>
<p>BUT I HAVE TO RESPOND TO TIM MC HUGH&rsquo;S POST #4:</p>
<p>That was THE FUNNIEST Civil War story I could EVER HOPE TO HEAR!  Thank you for sharing it with us; I&rsquo;ll cherish it as long as I live.</p>
<p>Members of my ancestral family fell in Pickett&rsquo;s Charge and other phases of that terrible battle.  I don&rsquo;t think those potheads meant any more disrespect than you and your side kick; in fact, that battlefield is so eerily surreal, it makes me feel &#8220;stoned&#8221; anyway.</p>
<p>Look!  There&rsquo;s General Armistead with his hat on his sword!  He&rsquo;s charging into the mouth of a belching cannon!  For a fleeting second, you can imagine his inspiration, no matter the odds.  </p>
<p>When I was a kid, my Grandma told me of that desperate effort as someone who had heard of it through some who had actually witnessed and survived it.</p>
<p>But after a century and a half, I think its gravity can use a little levity.  In fact, during April, I think the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus and the NAACP can afford a little latitude instead of attitude.     </p>

		<p>1) &#8220;that Lincoln offered the South slavery permanently if they would agree not to secede.&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew that the civil war was fought over states rights, but had no idea that Lincoln did this.  Amazing.</p>

		<p>Are the action of Governor McDonnell verging on &#8216;historicism&rsquo;? Why not call for something more defensible like White History month?</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;L. Douglas Wilder called it &#8216;mind-boggling to say the least&hellip;it&rsquo;s quite another to distort history.&rsquo;..&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rsquo;Governor McDonnell&rsquo;s proclamation was offensive and offered a disturbing revision of the Civil War and the brutal era that followed,&rsquo; said Del. Kenneth Cooper Alexander (Race-Norfolk), chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If were weren&rsquo;t in the grips of a PC reign of terror, and if the msm were reporting the news impartially, Wilder would be called on to explain exactly &#8216;how history is being distorted&rsquo; and Cooper to explain precisely how McDonell&rsquo;s proclamation &#8216;offers a revision of the WBTS.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Half a million mostly Whites die to (as conventional wisdom has it) &#8216;free the slaves&rsquo; but when White descendants want to honor those who sacrificed their lives for &#8216;those who don&rsquo;t look like them&rsquo;, they are portrayed as racist and evil.</p>
<p>But for blacks, everything is about slavery and the legacy of slavery  &mdash;  used as an excuse to cover up for their shortcomings and the multiple difficulties they have fitting into an advanced, First World Technological civilization.</p>
<p>Better to change the First World into the Third World so blacks and other low-IQd non-Whites can feel better about themselves.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don`t think those pot heads meant any more disrespect than you&#8221;-KonfederateKarl<br>
Karl, I understood it instantly also. In fact the sad truth is they probably  have more respect and enthusiasm  than most of our citizens and politicans that grovel as if the South is an embarressment. One more thing you might like. Later my buddy pontificated that if we were ever to visit Pearl Harbour on Dec. 7th, the same three juggleheads would be on the fantail of the Arizona in dungarees and boondockers, scanning the horizon with navy Binoculars, searching for Jap diverbombers and Park Ranger patrol boats&hellip;</p>

		<p>The first book I read that opened my eyes was &#8220;Lincoln the Man,&#8221; by Edgar Lee Masters. I actually got depressed and angry while I was reading it because I realized that I had been lied to my whole life.  </p>

		<p>The NAACP demanded and did receive an amendment from the Governor that slavery be included in CHM. </p>
<p>Fine.  That also means that when VA celebrates black history month next February (using far more tax money than CHM, I might add), then we should demand that black crime be part of the discussion.</p>

		<p>To Tim Mc Hugh (#29):</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a hoot, Tim!  I busted another gut with your postscript to the Gettysburg story.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve visited the Arizona memorial; it&rsquo;s another very somber, surreal atmosphere.  And I can easily envision those three bedazzled veg-heads on &#8220;high&#8221; alert.  Time was, I could&rsquo;ve been one of &#8216;em.  Hawaiian bud was da kine, bra&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the laughs!      </p>

		<p>The NAACP loves drama when it calls an emergency meeting because White people ignore them.  Black boycotts are inaffective and useless.  Their boycott of South Caroline was a boom to the tourist industry.</p>
