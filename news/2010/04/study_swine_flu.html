<h1>Study: Swine Flu Took a Greater Toll on Minorities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristen Stewart, Salt Lake Tribune, April 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last year&rsquo;s outbreak of H1N1 resulted in a higher toll on young, overweight minorities, say Utah medical researchers, who argue that not putting this population at the front of the vaccination line may have cost lives, and cost hospitals and taxpayers millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Children, pregnant women and people with lung problems were given first priority for H1N1 vaccinations, some of them standing in line for hours outside health departments.</p>
<p>But early on, doctors noticed the sickest patients were more likely to be young adults, obese and of Hispanic or Pacific Island descent, says Russ Miller, medical director of Intermountain Medical Center&rsquo;s respiratory intensive care unit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study was published in this month&rsquo;s issue of Chest, the scientific medical journal of the American College of Chest Physicians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pacific Islanders make up 1 percent of the county&rsquo;s population, but accounted for 26 percent of the H1N1 stays in the intensive care unit. Hispanics are 13 percent of the population, but 23 percent of the H1N1 cases studied.</p>
<p>The patients were also more likely to be overweight. All of the eight patients who died were obese or morbidly obese, the study found.</p>
<p>More research is needed to determine if obesity or ethnicity alone are risk factors, or whether it&rsquo;s a combination of things, said Miller.</p>

		<p>Last fall, a scheduled football game between two HBCUs, Stillman of Tuscaloosa AL, and Clark Atlanta, the game was in Tuscaloosa, was canceled.  Almost half the members of Stillman&rsquo;s team had H1N1.  I think H1N1 disproportionately affected blacks, too.</p>

		<p>I think the various flus generally hit young overweight minority people the hardest, because they are the least likely to eat a decent diet, get enough sleep, stay off drugs and booze, and in general take care of themselves.  I don&rsquo;t see any mystery here.</p>

<p>Yeah, right. The vaccine was either useless, or downright dangerous. I refused to take it, and, like most of us, escaped the horrible panemic that was predicted to sweep the world. I think the best way to get the Swine Flu was to take the vaccine, just like the people who got the Spanish Flu in the outbreak of the early 1900&rsquo;s. Anecdotal evidence suggests that unvaccinated back then escaped without harm, while those taking the vaccine got sick and died.</p>
<p>As well, our federal goverment purchased and planned to use an adjuvant called squalene in the vaccines, which was proven to be the cause of Gulf War Syndrome. Nothing like having Big Brother look out for you, is there?</p>

<p>But race is just a social construct. We&rsquo;re all the same, you see. Just different skin colors. Yeah, that&rsquo;s the ticket.</p>

		<p>My daughter and I both had H1N1 last winter. It was myserable and we were out of comission for about a week and a half but we recovered without hospitalization or other complications. My daughter&rsquo;s pediatrician did not even offer the vaccine and I will not take a flu shot, she had the regular flu shot so we knew it was H1N1. The instacare we went to said that they had not had any really serious cases and I live in a heavily Hispanic area. I think that if you don&rsquo;t take good care of yourself you will be likely to get sicker from minor stuff. </p>

<p>I agree. My daughter is in her 30&rsquo;s, white, and slender,in good health. She believed the hype and got the shot, and immediately came down with H1N1. I didn&rsquo;t get the shot and I was just fine, despite nursing my daughter, therefore being exposed for several days. Of the few people that I know who were infected by H1N1, every single one of them had gotten the shot. <br>
As a side note, my grandmother was a young woman during the Spanish Influenza pandemic and she helped her physician father nurse flu victims, and even sewed many of those who died of it into their shrouds, and she never even came down with so much as the sniffles during the entire outbreak. </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;who argue that not putting [overweight hispanics and pacific islanders] at the front of the vaccination line may have cost lives, and cost hospitals and taxpayers millions of dollars&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They cost taxpayers millions of dollars anyway.</p>
<p>If the government wants to put them at the head of the vaccination line, go ahead  &mdash;  they will be put at the front of the line anyway for health care, in front of Whites.</p>
<p>I believe we are being primed for forced vaccinations when the &#8216;new improved&rsquo;  communist-government health care system comes on line  &mdash;  sold to us as a &#8216;preventative&rsquo; measure, of course. At that point,  I think Whites may be the lucky ones, as we&rsquo;ll be dead last in line for forced vaccines and may even be lucky enough to have any vaccine sera run out before the health care system finally gets around to the dregs  &mdash;  us Whites, that is. </p>

<p>Dan, it&rsquo;s worse than that:</p>
<p>This is from Dr. Blaylock over at NewsMax.com:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Why did the Department of Defense shroud complications of the anthrax vaccine in top secret files until forced to release it? The clandestine files showed that the <br>
vaccine caused a 200 percent increase in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or Lou <br>
Gehrig&rsquo;s disease. </p>
<p>The flu vaccines contain a full dose of mercury (as thimerosal) as well as dangerous <br>
immune stimulators (called adjuvants). Virtually all neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, are triggered and <br>
worsened by chronic brain inflammation. </p>
<p>And stay tuned for the coup de grâce:</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;The communist Chinese have entered the biotechnology market. They are now one of the world&rsquo;s leading manufacturers, producing 41 of the vaccines used in this country. Soon, they will manufacture the great majority of vaccines. </p>
<p>The FDA inspects most pharmaceutical plants in the United States that manufacture vaccines, but a recent report disclosed that it inspects Chinese facilities only once every 13 years. To make matters worse, the U.S. government must depend on local Chinese officials to supply them with data and to translate it from Chinese to<br>
English. Reports indicate that the translated data the Chinese provide are suspect. Worse still, the FDA inspects only a tiny fraction  &mdash;  1.8 percent <br>
 &mdash;  of Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology sites&hellip;.&#8221; </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/yeodqeg</p>
<p>Would you trust or allow yourself or your children to take a vaccine if you knew it were manufactured by the Communist Chinese (or even the USG for that matter)?</p>
<p>And remember Dan:  Big Brother won in the end.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
