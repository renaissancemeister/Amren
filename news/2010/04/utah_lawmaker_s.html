<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The political and legal fallout now plaguing Arizona after that state&rsquo;s passage of one of the nation&rsquo;s toughest new immigration laws could soon be headed for Utah.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Stephen Sandstrom, R-Orem, told the Deseret News Monday he&rsquo;s started work on drafting a bill for the 2011 Utah legislative session that uses the Arizona statute as a model  &mdash;  a move he said is necessary to stanch the flow of illegal immigrants into the Beehive State.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While critics of the bill say it will lead to racial profiling and likely makes inroads into rights protected under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Sandstrom said it&rsquo;s no different from enforcement policy local police officers already use.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you get pulled over for driving intoxicated, what&rsquo;s the first thing the officer asks for?&#8221; Sandstrom said. &#8220;Your ID, right? This is the same thing, the same work police officers are already doing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. asking for documentation that relates to probable cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>That law enforcement inquiry is one that American Civil Liberties Union of Utah director Karen McCreary said is unacceptable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McCreary said her colleagues at the ACLU of Arizona are already preparing for a lawsuit aimed at stopping implementation of the law, in conjunction with a variety of civil rights and immigrant advocate groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Utah Gov. Gary Herbert wasn&rsquo;t ready to weigh in on Sandstrom&rsquo;s proposal without seeing the language of the bill, but his spokeswoman, Angie Welling, said the governor understood the burden being placed on states to impose their own statutes in lieu of immigration reform at the federal level.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Rebecca Chavez-Houck, D-Salt Lake City, said it is far too early for Utah to be following in the footsteps of its southern neighbor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you this,&#8221; Sandstrom said. &#8220;The people in the state of Utah will be behind this bill.&#8221;<br>

						<p>
							<i>Boston Globe, April 28, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>San Antonio Express-News and Houston Chronicle report Wednesday that Republican Rep. Debbie Riddle of Tomball says she will introduce the measure in the January legislative session.</p>
<p>The new Arizona law would require local and state law enforcement to question people about their immigration status  &mdash;  and make it a crime for immigrants to lack registration documents.</p>
<p>Riddle says if the federal government did its job &#8220;Arizona wouldn&rsquo;t have to take this action, and neither would Texas.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The domino effect won&rsquo;t be allowed.  Those states hurt by Arizona&rsquo;s forced out-flux of illegals must now try to imitate Arizona with needed laws that make life difficult for illegals. Each state that does then threatens all other states with the illegal run to their  sanctuary.  The logical result will be that one after the other, states will all become forced to pass harsh measures.  This will justify whatever amnesty obamavoodoo wants, and amnesty will make state immigration enforcements laws as federally outlawed as racial segregation in schools and public accommodations was in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s when modern amerika was being created. <br>
 </p>
<p>Our greatest enemies are White liberals who created, allowed, and will profit from this mess, while protecting themselves and their families in safe jobs and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Integration would have failed if the nation had been or became bankrupt.  Collapse may save the Whites, for in an emergency we will learn to come together, know who is of us, and throw the rest out to the non white aliens and afrovoodoo thugs.</p>
<p>We approach the day of reckoning. How will Heidi adjust?  <br>

		<p>Go, Utah, and go, Texas!!!  Let&rsquo;s get CA and NM on the bandwagon as well!  The Feds have failed to do their job - so now it&rsquo;s the states&rsquo; rights to do it themselves.  Let the ACLU marxists squall and scream; we need to handle our situations on a statewide level.  I am quite sure there isn&rsquo;t a state in the Union that isn&rsquo;t heartily sick of illegal immigrants, and of being overrun by Mexicans and other aliens who don&rsquo;t speak English.  Enough is enough.  The acceptance of the AZ law by the vast majority of its citizens is proof that legal Americans want the illegals GONE.</p>

		<p>It appears all eyes have been upon Arizona for some time now.</p>
<p>In addition to Utah &amp; Texas looking to initiate action, gubernatorial candidates from both Oklahoma &amp; Minnesota have mentioned that they would support similar measures. </p>
<p>Even Alabama chimes in with &#8220;This is Alabama, we speak English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lets hope Arizona stands its ground &amp; the momentum continues. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;critics of the bill say it will lead to racial profiling&#8221; - Of course it will, but only because 90% of the illegal aliens in America are of the Latino/Hispanic &#8220;Race&#8221;.  Overwhelmingly, the critics are likewise Latino/Hispanic and daily prove themselves to be anti-White, anti-Black, anti-Legal-Immigrant, and anti-American.  Their fixation on race shows their true color (pun intended) and allegiance.  That every other group outright denies any racial aspect to immigration just shows their own false piety.</p>

		<p>I know this isn&rsquo;t EXACTLY nullification, because this legislation isn&rsquo;t directly repudiating a federal law, but it&rsquo;s in the same spirit.  The states are exerting their authority where the federal government has fallen short.</p>
<p>This attitude is growing across the nation and I love to see it.  People are rediscovering states&rsquo; rights and it can go a long way toward reining in the out-of-control DC government.</p>

		<p>Many years ago I read something in an article that has always stuck with me. The author said that people don&rsquo;t rebel until there&rsquo;s a spark of hope.</p>
<p>We Whites have gone along for many years watching our culture and our race being constantly attacked. I&rsquo;m sure many of us have felt the situation was hopeless. I know I have. </p>
<p>But now we have Arizona. Now we have hope and it looks like we&rsquo;re finally starting to come together. I believe the genie is out of the bottle and there&rsquo;s no putting it back.    </p>

<p>____________</p>
<p>Since when has the ACLU been against US law enforcement asking people for their ID&rsquo;s? Sounds like a position they have only recently adopted because of the circumstances in Arizona. So, as an American citizen, if I refuse to show my ID to a cop and get hauled off to jail for it I can now call the ACLU to come to my rescue?</p>

		<p>As somebody who hails from Utah, I must state that I am highly skeptical about the successful inception of this law. It is true that Utah is both a Republican state and traditionally &#8220;conservative,&#8221; but due to the relatively &#8220;small&#8221; size of the illegal (Mexican) population compared to Arizona, many people here remain indifferent to the problem. There is also the fact that the predominant religion (viz LDS) is extremely egalitarian in nature, and seeks doctrinal expansion at the cost of racial preservation. Most Mormons are of Anglo-Saxon descent, but place little value on this fact, and graciously welcome anybody willing to adopt the religion into their fold; this is, after all, the same group of people who imported thousands of Polynesians (i.e. Tongans and Samoans) into this state simply because of the latter&rsquo;s compliant conversion, and as a result our streets now &#8220;enjoy&#8221; the presence and feud of the Tongan Crips and Samoan Bloods.</p>
<p>The rich &#8220;elite&#8221; in Utah, and especially within Salt Lake county, is comprised mostly of White Mormons who perfectly fall into the category of the deluded and conceited left, with only the most superficial pretense of &#8220;conservative&#8221; values. They are either extremely disinterested in the racial problem, or damage the cause of racial preservation further by allowing non-Whites to proclaim their supposed racial &#8220;slights,&#8221; all the while taking pleasure in the isolation of their own sumptuous condition. It is the &#8220;poorer&#8221; Whites (like on so many occasions), who happen to live on the west side of Salt Lake City, who ultimately pay the price for this mindless social experiment and bourgeois indolence.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is not taking into consideration the immutable fact that if Utah were to pass this law, or show any strong possibility of doing so, the Obama administration (and all other anti-American cadres) would most certainly descend upon the state with an iron fist, attempting to both punish it, and in so doing sending a dangerous message to other states.</p>
<p>If this law is drafted, I for one, will be very surprised.</p>

		<p>Hurray! Let&rsquo;s hope all states affected by illegal immigration which is all of them, will get on the bandwagon and stop the invasion. When all Americans are gainfully employed, then if they must have foreign workers, what about those who&rsquo;ve applied and waited in their own countries? Why not let them come? We already have about eight guest-worker plans. Why do we really need to legalize or even let illegals remain? They laughed at our laws. Let&rsquo;s show them the US will no longer be the dumping ground of the world.</p>

		<p> I live in Utah. I have seen my beloved city of Salt turn from a picturesque haven with little to no crime into a mirror image of the incremental destruction of civility that has happened to most other major cities. Still not too many blacks here (Im sure that will change) but the hispanic population has exploded. Many schools in the valley have nothing but hispanic kids. Former clean safe working class neighborhoods are now run down and shabby with the stereotypical 3 cars on the front lawn parked on a carpet of empty beer cans. Sad indeed.<br>
 Mormons (I am one) have no history of social activism like the catholics or the silly liberals in places like Minnesota or Maine. Besides illegals are Catholics, not Mormons. I think there will be a HUGE influx of illegals to Utah and a HUGE corresponding increase of crime. We Mormons are notorious tight-wads and are disgusted with the &#8220;welfare mentality&#8221; (God helps those who help themselves) We will have no problem supporting a law similar to Arizona. </p>

		<p>As I predicted a few days ago; other states - even eventually California - will be FORCED to pass legislation similar to that in Arizona, or else be deluged with illegal aliens arriving from the states which have already passed these laws.  California may hold out for a while, but the state is bankrupt, and the additional budget pressure imposed by illegals&rsquo; demands on services (even just the police and courts) will be the straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>

		<p>Obama isn&rsquo;t going to be in the whitehouse very long.  I suspect that only days after the republicans take back the senate and house, during the 2010 elections, they will move to impeach him (and there are many good reasons they can use).</p>
<p>Why is that important with regard to immigration?  Well, both the republicans and the democrats have pushed non-white immigration in the past.  The dems do it because they are closet marxists and they know that non-whites overwhelmingly support marxism.  But the republican reasons are more practical.  They want mexico to be stable and to continue to supply the US with oil.  Neither of these things is possible any longer.  The mexican government is months away from being overthrown and the mexican oil industry has been losing capacity for years and years.  In only a short time more, it will lose the ability to supply oil at all, to any significant degree.</p>
<p>This means the GOP no longer has any reason to cater to mexicans and strong political gains to be made by kicking these people out.  There is real opportunity here.  Imagine what would happen to the US economy if the incredible drain of immigrant welfare was removed?  It would boom&hellip;and bear strong and permanent contrast with the failure under the democrats.</p>
<p>Is the GOP on our side?  Nope.  But our interests align now.  They can be used to accomplish a specific goal.  Just don&rsquo;t forget that they care nothing for anyone but themselves.</p>

		<p>Awhile back when the new Arizona law was making its way through the legislature, I said that the only way it would have a fighting change of survival would be if a multitude of other states passed crackdowns of a similar nature. Now it appears that this may indeed be the case. There&rsquo;s talk of replicating what Arizona just did in Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, Minnesota and hopefully many other states will join as well. If this doesn&rsquo;t occur, the new Arizona law will no doubt face the same dismal fate as Proposition 187 in California back in the 1990s when it was dismantled before ever having a chance of halting the illegal invasion. The only way we&rsquo;re going to make any headway is if this recent rebellion in Arizona spreads far and wide.  </p>
