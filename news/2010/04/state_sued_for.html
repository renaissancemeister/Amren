			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Errin Haines, Sun News (Macon, Georgia), April 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Georgia NAACP has sued the state, claiming it has systematically underfunded its three public black colleges and threatened their survival as a result.</p>
<p>Gov. Sonny Perdue and Board of Regents Chancellor Errol Davis are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court. Two students at Savannah State University and Fort Valley State University joined the NAACP as plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Attorney John Clark said the alumni associations of Albany State University, Fort Valley State University and Savannah State University support the legal action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether there&rsquo;s money or no money, we get the same answer,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;The time is now to address inequities that have persisted. It is never too late to have redress.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Legal Defense Coalition for the Preservation of Public HBCUs, which is also supporting the lawsuit, published a 2008 report claiming the state violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 14th Amendment in its treatment of the three colleges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the report, a lack of state funding has for decades hobbled the institutions and kept them from establishing professional programs on par with their mainstream counterparts in Georgia. As a result of systematic discrimination by the Board of Regents, the state&rsquo;s public black colleges have had second-class status and operated under de facto segregation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The coalition report also said none of Georgia&rsquo;s state black colleges are classified as research universities or offer professional degree programs and there is a disparity in funding for capital improvement projects at these colleges. The coalition is a nonprofit organization incorporated in 2007 made up of alumni and supporters of Georgia&rsquo;s public black colleges.</p>

		<p>The historically black colleges in EVERY Southern state are black by CHOICE, not by mandate, at least today.  What are they going to do, force white people to apply to HBC&rsquo;s?  Very few whites want to go to school in any predominantly black school, because of the very real potential for violence against them in such places.  I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s up to the state to somehow &#8220;redress&#8221; perceived past wrongs by forking over money today.  Instead, the HBC&rsquo;s need to come into today&rsquo;s world by hiring and training expert fund-raisers for their schools, and by then appealing to top black professional athletes and actors and businesspeople and politicians.  Quit kvetching and get into the real world and do something productive for once.  </p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t &#8220;addressing the inequities&#8221; include funding white colleges? Never mind that these too would be filled with same kind of hate-the-west rhetoric as on display in this article, shouldn&rsquo;t they at least exist?</p>

		<p>About 40 year ago when she was a graduate student, my wife taught a semester at an historically black university &mdash; we needed the money. Because most of the students flunked the first exam, she went back over the material and gave the exam again. She ended up lecturing from the book, hoping the students would at least learn it  &mdash;  never mind the extra material she could have added. The last week of class, she had students whom she had never seen before showing up and telling her that they needed to pass her course in order to go out and become student teachers. She flunked a lot of students, which didn&rsquo;t make the department chair very happy and she was not asked to teach there again.</p>
<p>At the same time there was another graduate student teaching a section of the same course. At the end of the term, this person told her students they were doing so well that she was giving all of them an A. She was asked to teach there again.</p>
<p>Hope this helps explain the current situation.</p>

		<p>Are these institutions currently &#8220;Black&#8221; or are they now White, and only previously &#8220;Historically Black&#8221;?</p>
<p>If they are currently Black, isn&rsquo;t that racist?  Shouldn&rsquo;t those colleges be integrated?  Why would the State support a racist school?</p>
<p>If the institutions were &#8220;historically Black,&#8221; but are no longer Black then there is no racial discrimination, because those schools presumably contain all races, just like the top GA school, the University of Georgia.  Hence, there is no bias against groups of students, but, instead, against schools.  The latter is the norm, where states always provide more money to their flagship university, than to secondary or tertiary schools.</p>
<p>Finally, because race is only a social construct and does not exist, then it makes no racial difference if most of the state funding goes to the top school or is spread equally among schools, because all schools have the same race   &mdash;   i.e., the Human Race.  Are these people claiming that &#8220;race&#8221; is a true scientific entity?  As mentioned above, the top public university in each state gets the most funding.  This allows the best students to go to the best-funded school, which helps our society, by accelerating the education of the best and brightest   &mdash;   the very people who have the greatest potential to make real contributions.  </p>
<p>I think the faculty at the Historically Black schools are confused.  I wonder where they received their education and I wonder in which fields they obtained their degrees.<br>

		<p>How is it still possible to have &#8220;black colleges&#8221; when &#8220;white colleges&#8221; have been forbidden for decades? </p>
<p>These &#8220;black colleges&#8221; are state institutions, not private schools&hellip;..complaining about the lack of money from the state budget. </p>
<p>Here again, how can a state&hellip;.any state&hellip;..have a state &#8220;black college&#8221; when it would be impossible to have a state &#8220;white college&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Average SAT scores at historically black colleges:</p>
<p>FISK: 880<br>
Florida A&M;: 920<br>
Hampton: 950<br>
Spelman: 1000<br>
Tuskegee: 900<br>
Xavier:900</p>
<p>Mind you that 900 is about the score you would get if you randomly answered every question. Thats a 450 score in math or verbal. At my high school the only people not to break 1000 on the SAT were severly retarded.</p>

		<p>A degree from a black college at best might mean the graduate can read and write at an 8th. grade level.<br>
Everyone knows the AA diploma&rsquo;s blacks posses are not really worth the paper they are printed on, they are just A Ticket to a Guberment Job.</p>

		<p>This phrase &#8220;historically Black&#8221; is propaganda. It is P.C. for &#8220;currently Black.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t they be honest and simply say &#8220;currently Black&#8221; or &#8220;Predominately Black&#8221; school?  After all, that is what they are concerned with and what they really mean.  The reason they use the word &#8220;Historically&#8221; is because they want to hide the fact that this is currently a &ldquo;race-based&rdquo; school.  It is exactly opposite their stated goal for &#8220;total integration.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Note the hypocrisy: They demand integration from Whites, but not from Blacks.  They feel that Blacks should have &#8220;race-based schools&#8221; but that Whites should not.  They will go to great lengths to hide this hypocrisy.  Hence they use the word &#8220;Historically.&#8221;</p>
<p>A cynical political ploy is a terrible thing to waste. <br>

		<p>  I must admit I am befuddled. With an all black enrollment, and all black instruction, an academic environment totally understanding and supporting of blacks&rsquo; needs and aspirations, and no racist whites on campus to distract them from their studies, it would seem like the HBCU&rsquo;s would be turning out a very high percentage of extremely well-educated graduates who shine in the workplace. Such graduates would earn high salaries due to their accomplishmentments and achievements in both the public and private sectors, and the contributions and endowments flowing back to the HBCU&rsquo;s from the grateful alumni would negate the need for any governmental financial support.</p>

		<p>Well for one &#8220;historically black&#8221; university, Florida A&M;, they just received 70 million dollars through the good offices of Alan Boyd, a white, supposedly blue-dog democrat from N Fl.  He voted no originally on the HC bill and on the final House vote switched from no to yes.  Was part of his price to switch votes the 70 million dollars?  Very interesting in that his white constituents are madder than hell with him.  So  he runs into the arms of his black voters with that cash.  Just think, this is the school that was on academic probation and almost lost accreditation.  This is the same school in which a state audit uncovered such theft of cash and property that it had to be swept under the rug and no criminal charges filed if a few ringleaders would just leave.  This is the same school where hundreds of students bought grades from hackers who have found themselves now in jail but no student has been punished.  And on and on.</p>
