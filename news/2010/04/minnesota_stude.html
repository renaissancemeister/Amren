<h1>Minnesota Students Are Put to the Test to Improve Scores</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregory A. Patterson, Star Tribune (St. Paul-Minneapolis), April 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ames Elementary School Principal Delores Henderson stands on a stairwell landing directing noisy student traffic. She points black kids downstairs to the multipurpose room, Hmong students to the reading room around the corner, white and Hispanic kids to separate rooms up another flight of stairs.</p>
<p>In separate rooms, the classmates hear the same message from teachers of their own ethnic background and then from Henderson: This school was the best in the state two years ago on the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment-II exams. You come from an accomplished culture, you are gifted, and we expect the same from you this year.</p>
<p>Quarrel with her divide-and-conquer strategy if you like, but it&rsquo;s hard to argue with the results. While nine of 10 students in her St. Paul school come from low-income homes and 86 percent are children of color, test results are above average for the district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;A long way to go&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At St. Paul Public Schools, administrators frustrated with meager improvement in recent years set an ambitious goal of improving math and science by scores 10 percentage points this year. Then-interim Superintendent Suzanne Kelly announced the benchmark, calling the fact that more than half of the district&rsquo;s students fail to meet reading and math standards an &#8220;unconscionable truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>St. Paul and Minneapolis have lined up hundreds of volunteer tutors. St. Paul has persuaded churches to open their pulpits to conversations about school and their community rooms to tutoring sessions. They have looked at each student to determine which individual skills need improvement.</p>

Nice tier system:</p>
<p>Blacks on the bottom (downstairs)<br>
Hmong on the middle level<br>
and whites on the top level along with the hispanics because well&hellip;they look kinda white, so that&rsquo;s close enough.</p>
<p>The principle seems pretty desperate,or pretty stupid to try something like this in todays climate. In all probability, her experiment will have a rather short shelf-life.</p>
<p> I hope she gets to keep her job now that the cat&rsquo;s out of the bag.</p>

		<p>For 40+ years, enormous financial resources, highly concentrated efforts, and extensive academic studies have attempted to resolve an intellectual difference that nature clearly defined.</p>
<p>Indeed, the most dedicated egalitarians on Earth have literally left no stone unturned in their attempts to create racial parity and produce measurable intellectual equality between Whites and Blacks. </p>
<p>Despite their herculean efforts, the exhaustive array of resources, and the unrelenting focus that has been brought to bear on this &#8220;problem&#8221;, there have been absolutely no advancements in the intellect of Blacks. The test scores verify this decade after decade. Intelligence is simply something that cannot be taught.</p>
<p>Where are the studies that explain how and why &#8220;dirt-poor&#8221; White students somehow manage to receive good grades in school, as a group, while Blacks from upper-income, affirmative action families routinely fail out of school, as a group?</p>
<p>The social and academic experts have literally tried everything to help Blacks pass! They&rsquo;ve tried placing Black students in all-Black schools with all-Black teachers. Same results   &mdash;   failure! They&rsquo;ve tried to place the Black students in an all-White environment. Same results   &mdash;   failure! They tried placing Black students in small, highly-controlled groups with the very best academians and scholars skillfully and carefully applying the very best academic learning principles known to man! Same results   &mdash;   abject failure! </p>
<p>In the end, the government significantly lowered the standards, repeatedly. Of course, this ridiculous solution only punishes White and Asian students by inadequately challenging them. The end result is that the Black students still fail!</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>How about open-book tests? It was tried! The Blacks failed! </p>
<p>What about pictures-only tests? The Blacks failed!</p>
<p>What if the teachers were allowed to teach the test? They did! The Blacks still failed!</p>
<p>What if special, highly-trained tutors were provided for *only* the Black students? It was tried! The Blacks still failed!</p>
<p>What if Blacks were allowed to take the same test again after initially failing the test and subsequently given the correct answers? That was tried! The Blacks still failed!</p>
<p>How about using tests designed by Black &#8220;educators&#8221;? You guessed it! It was tried! The Blacks still failed!</p>
<p>One school completely did away with tests, yet the Blacks still managed to fail somehow. How is that even possible?!?!? Well, I suppose if they committed a homicide or gang-rape in school, that would constitute grounds for failure, but who knows? Maybe they burned the school down. God only knows, but they still managed to fail at disproportionate rates with NO standards applied and no tests given!</p>
<p>The point is that no amount of effort can improve the results of Black students, because the best efforts have already been applied on a constant basis for 40+ years. Result? NO CHANGE! The Blacks still fail at highly-disproportional rates!</p>
<p>My friends, this issue, and many other social issues, is no longer a political question. It has become a question of survival. Why? Because we are *forced* by the government to financially support actions that we are bitterly opposed to. The money wasted on Blacks is money stolen from OUR pockets by the government! We should be using our money to make a better life for ourselves and our families, not giving it to government bureaucrats to waste and pay for our own destruction!!!</p>
<p>We are forced to subsidize desegregation.<br>
We are forced to subsidize Blacks on welfare.<br>
We are forced to subsidize the social interests of Blacks.<br>
We are forced to subsidize the health care of Blacks.<br>
We are forced to subsidize the wasted education of Blacks.<br>
We are forced to subsidize the destruction of our nation and our own race.</p>
<p>You toil and labor to support Blacks!</p>
<p>This is pure madness! Enough!</p>
<p>There is a reason why Africa is still in the stone age.</p>
<p>These are perilous times, my friends! God bless you all!</p>

		<p>Obama and his minions know full-well that blacks will not be able to EVER compete in a first world society, and, if the push to excellence continues, it will forever reveal blacks as underachievers to the rest of the world, while all the other races are visibly ahead of them.</p>
<p>So, what can be done to rectify the problem?  Nothing has worked to &#8220;close the achievement gap,&#8221; and, of course, nothing ever will close it. </p>
<p>The answer is to dumb down everything to the black level, of course.  That way the world will only see an America that is usually at the bottom or near the bottom in every subject, and failure will have white faces as well as black ones, and by that process blacks won&rsquo;t stand out by themselves as incompetents.</p>
<p>But, how can it be implemented?  By doing what his administration is doing now.  Instructing his minions to convince the population that we are no longer EVER going to be number one, but, more importantly, they want us all to know that being number one is unimportant.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re preparing us to accept what they&rsquo;re working towards: A gradual dumbing down process which will cause the entire system to fall to the black norm, or very near it.</p>
<p>I mean, after all, we can rely on foreign countries for high skilled professions as we&rsquo;re doing to some extent right now.</p>
<p>This empire is doomed.<br>

		<p>In response to comment #1, the only solution is to take back the government and the country.  Just as the Foundling Fathers had to separate from England.  There is enough voters in this country who did not vote to form another party.  The present government is run by biggg money.  But still, this country still need consumers and taxpayers to keep even biggg money afloat.</p>

		<p>Funny name, &#8220;Delores&#8221;.  An ignorant misspelling of the Spanish word for &#8220;sorrows&#8221;, it serves as the female counterpart to &#8220;Leroy&#8221;, i.e., it&rsquo;s much more popular among blacks than among whites, but for some unknown reason also caught on among Scandinavian-Americans.  However, a quick glance at the Ames site reveals that Dr Henderson is <i>not</i> Scandinavian: www.ames.spps.org/</p>
<p>(Not much, anyway.)</p>
<p>One thing I <i>will</i> give her school credit for  &mdash;   you can see on the roster of teachers that &#8220;Mrs&#8221; outnumbers &#8220;Ms&#8221; 9-2.  Indeed, there are as many teachers called &#8220;Mrs Vang&#8221; (the &#8216;Nguyen&rsquo; of the Hmong) as &#8220;Ms Anything&#8221;.  Tradition returns!</p>
<p>Only two go by &#8220;Mr&#8221;, and one of those is hyphenated.</p>

		<p>Well Well, It seems some ideas die hard. Who would&rsquo;a thunk segregation is the answer?</p>
<p>A bit off subject. One of the members of my discussion group brought in a copy of the Final exam for 8th graders in Salina, Kansas, 1895. I defy anyone to find a HS Valedictorian today who could even get close to scoring 50% on that exam.</p>

		<p>This story absolutely belongs in the &#8220;Too Funny for Words&#8221; category. Given it substantiates so perfectly what is termed &#8220;popular wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I find particularly wrong and something many teachers would agree with me on&hellip; the policy of punishing or blaming teachers for the inability of mostly minority students to maintain acceptable grades. Paraphrasable thusly: You can offer a Black student a chance to learn; but you can&rsquo;t FORCE him to acquire a real education.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny?</p>
<p>They say we are all the same, and can not close the all the gaps anywhere for decades.<br>
They say human racism is a social construct, and nether can fight it nor can find any other reason for the gaps.</p>
<p>Actually lefties are failing in any way: If the gaps are because of race differences, there are races. If the gaps are baucause of racism, it means you can not fight racism even if you try it in decades with the support of all media and programs -Than racims must be part of the human nature.</p>

<p>Keep in mind also that India has more genius young people than we have young people.  Our miniscule young and gifted can&rsquo;t carry the load of ingnoramus&rsquo; within our country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;You toil and labor to support Blacks!..&#8221;</p>
<p>In California (hell, in the entire Southwest) you toil and labor to support foreign  colonists that are welcomed by &#8216;YOUR&rsquo;  US government and have more rights, benefits, support and advocates than you do.  Your government tells you that all cultures are of equal value, except for White culture, which is evil and must be eradicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;This is pure madness! Enough!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;d almost think that the government was doing it on purpose, wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>You might think the government well knows that blacks with IQs of 85 will never leave the left side of the bell curve, the achievement gap cannot be closed and that all cultures ARE not equal (Do you wonder why government elites send their precious children to exclusive private schools and live in neighborhoods that are 99% White?).</p>
<p>You might think the government&rsquo;s ultimate goal is not to close the black/White achievement gap, or to &#8216;celebrate diversity&rsquo; by flooding the US with uneducated, penniless Third World non-Whites, but rather the goal, in a carefully laid-out plan, activated on multiple fronts over five decades, is to terrorize and marginalize Whites, strip them of their wealth and land and ultimately replace them with a population that is easy to control, lives by Marxist slogans and is compliant with an authoritarian government.</p>
<p>You might accuse me of believing in &#8216;far-out&rsquo; conspiracy theories and that our benevolent government would never do any such thing.</p>
<p>In that case, you have not  been paying attention.  </p>
