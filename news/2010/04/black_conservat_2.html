<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9ETR1380&amp;show_article=1">Black Conservative Tea Party Backers Take Heat</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valerie Bauman, Breitbart, April 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They&rsquo;ve been called Oreos, traitors and Uncle Toms, and are used to having to defend their values. Now black conservatives are really taking heat for their involvement in the mostly white tea party movement  &mdash;  and for having the audacity to oppose the policies of the nation&rsquo;s first black president.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been told I hate myself. I&rsquo;ve been called an Uncle Tom. I&rsquo;ve been told I&rsquo;m a spook at the door,&#8221; said Timothy F. Johnson, chairman of the Frederick Douglass Foundation, a group of black conservatives who support free market principles and limited government.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Republicans find themselves always having to prove who they are. Because the assumption is the Republican Party is for whites and the Democratic Party is for blacks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Johnson and other black conservatives say they were drawn to the tea party movement because of what they consider its commonsense fiscal values of controlled spending, less taxes and smaller government. The fact that they&rsquo;re black  &mdash;  or that most tea partyers are white  &mdash;  should have nothing to do with it, they say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents have branded the tea party as a group of racists hiding behind economic concerns  &mdash;  and reports that some tea partyers were lobbing racist slurs at black congressmen during last month&rsquo;s heated health care vote give them ammunition.</p>
<p>But these black conservatives don&rsquo;t consider racism representative of the movement as a whole  &mdash;  or race a reason to support it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some black conservatives credit President Barack Obama&rsquo;s election  &mdash;  and their distaste for his policies  &mdash;  with inspiring them and motivating dozens of black Republicans to plan political runs in November.</p>
<p>For black candidates like McGlowan, tea party events are a way to reach out to voters of all races with her conservative message.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tea party voters represent a new model for these black conservatives  &mdash;  away from the black, liberal Democratic base located primarily in cities, and toward a black and white conservative base that extends into the suburbs.</p>
<p>Black voters have overwhelmingly backed Democratic candidates, support that has only grown in recent years. In 2004, presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry won 88 percent of the black vote; four years later, 95 percent of black voters cast ballots for Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve gotten the statement, &#8216;How can you not support the brother?&rsquo;&#8221; said David Webb, an organizer of New York City&rsquo;s Tea Party 365, Inc. movement and a conservative radio personality.</p>
<p>Since Obama&rsquo;s election, Webb said some black conservatives have even resorted to hiding their political views.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 38-year-old U.S. Marine Corps reservist recently walked into a bar in southern Maryland decorated with a Confederate flag. It gave his wife Rosha pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;You know what, honey? Many, many of our Southern citizens came together under that flag for the purpose of keeping their family and their state together,&rsquo;&#8221; Lollar recalled. &#8220;The flag is not what you&rsquo;re to fear. It&rsquo;s the stupidity behind the flag that is a problem. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll find that in here. Let&rsquo;s go ahead in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once inside, they were treated to a pig roast, a motorcycle rally  &mdash;  and presented with $5,000 in contributions for his campaign.</p>
<p>McGlowan, one of three GOP candidates in north Mississippi&rsquo;s 1st District primary, seeks a seat held since 2008 by Democrat Travis Childers. The National Republican Congressional Committee has supported Alan Nunnelee, chairman of the state Senate Appropriations Committee, who is also pursuing tea party voters.</p>

		<p>Any effort by black Americans to recognize the value of limited gov&rsquo;t is a positive thing.  But&hellip;let&rsquo;s remember that the Tea Party is a mile long but only an inch deep. The TP is not race realist, is not strong on defending our borders, and seems to take its cues from eccentrics like Glen Beck and like Sean Hannity. In Texas, they are even running Republican primary candidates against Ron Paul. The TP will quickly be co-opted by the Republican establishment.</p>

		<p>I am glad to see blacks joining us at the tea party gatherings, but there will never be a large number of them simply by looking at demographics. 13% of the population is black and 94% of that supports Obama, who is left? I will let someone else work the math, but given there are a handful at any tea party gathering, statistically speaking, they are probably over represented there. </p>

<p>Actually, I think it&rsquo;s done just the opposite   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s drawn some black &#8220;conservatives&#8221; (either real or pretend) out of the woodwork.  I tend to think most of them are faking it, because they can get instant fame, promotion and notoriety by joining the &#8220;right&#8221; side of the aisle.  They&rsquo;d have to wait in line and pay dues for a long time if they join the Democrat power structure.  </p>
<p>Here in St. Louis, I listen to some of the local neo or lamestream conservative talk radio sometimes, and I hear the hosts interview and gush on about these black &#8220;conservative&#8221; men and women.  The strange part is that I haven&rsquo;t heard about any of them until this past year   &mdash;   Two or three years ago, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you them from Eve.  </p>

		<p>This is hardly news.  Intelligent, self-reliant blacks have always &#8220;taken heat&#8221; from their more obtuse, indolent brethren.  Anyone who lives near any appreciable number of blacks knows the rare bird among them who shows any promise is usually victimized, if not brutalized, by the rest.  Is it any wonder then so many of the &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; (more like the talented twentieth) quickly &#8216;forget where they come from&rsquo; when the opportunity presents itself? </p>
<p>My mother always said that jealousy breeds hate, and blacks are living proof of it!</p>

<p>Is that IT?! A few individuals making racist slurs is the best they could come up with?</p>
<p>If this is the best evidence that the tea party is for white people with white concerns, then the tea party movement is doomed. I don&rsquo;t see it myself. I think people are reading a lot into the tea party movement, just as they are with Sarah Palin. Neither of them are genuinely pro-white.</p>
<p><i>They&rsquo;ve been called Oreos, traitors and Uncle Toms</i></p>
<p>But notice that none of THESE remarks are called &#8220;slurs.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think it DOES take courage to go against the mainstream in something as basic as race.  Blacks who support the Tea Party mvt are to be applauded, in my view; I think it only fair to give credit where credit is due.  I also agree that the Tea Party will be &#8220;amalgamated&#8221; by the Republicans, for the simple reason that we want to WIN the next few elections, and the only way we can do that is to present a united conservative front.  So it looks like we&rsquo;ll have a Republican Party with more blacks in it.  I don&rsquo;t have any problem with that.  We need every vote we can get.</p>

		<p>I tend to believe there is no such thing or very rare to be a real black conservative looking at all the people that have been touted by the MSM, Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell, Michael Steele, etc.  None of these people are conservative in a real sense and they likely got their jobs due to affirmative action because if they had been White they would have been passed on.    </p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s disgusting for any white to worry about showing a black face to the world, because they&rsquo;ve been intimidated or propagandized into thinking they should.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned these black so-called tea partiers are not really interested in the same things the whites are and their motives for joining are VERY suspect.</p>
<p>I wish they would bow out.  I&rsquo;m nice to them, but I&rsquo;d rather they go their own way.  There is no common ground for blacks and whites unless it is in forming an agreement to separate according to race.</p>

		<p>This is the root of the problem with the black community.  The truly successful among them, those who are collecting a handsome pay check without &#8220;working&#8221; for the government in some capacity, are derided and marginalized.  </p>
<p>Idiocy rules the day.  Intelligence and success are &#8220;white&#8221; and therefore bad things.  Why work when Obama&rsquo;s surely working on your reparations?  </p>

<p>In that scenario, who would &#8220;we&#8221; be?  A Tea Party that&rsquo;s been absorbed into the Republican Borg isn&rsquo;t a Tea Party any more.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;and the only way we can do that is to present a united conservative front.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Only if you believe that the Republican Party is a conservative party, which it patently is not.  What you&rsquo;re talking about is a united <i>Republican</i> front, with the Tea Partiers safely isolated and out of the way.</p>
<p><i>&#8221; So it looks like we&rsquo;ll have a Republican Party with more blacks in it. I don&rsquo;t have any problem with that.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I do.  What you&rsquo;re describing is a Democratic Party in all but name.  And &#8220;conservatives&#8221; will go right on voting for them anyway and be sold out, just as they have for the past fifty years.</p>
<p>The Republicans don&rsquo;t care any more about the wishes of the electorate than the Democrats.  All they care about is getting in power, and once there, they&rsquo;ll abandon the well-meaning dupes who put them there.</p>
<p>The Republicans can&rsquo;t save us, and aren&rsquo;t even interested in trying.  The difference between the Republican and Democratic parties is the difference between a rotten apple and a rotten orange.  One may stink less than the other, but they&rsquo;ll both make you sick.</p>

		<p><i>Since Obama&rsquo;s election, Webb said some black conservatives have even resorted to hiding their political views.</i></p>
<p>Slightly off topic, but I saw an interesting example of something like this on TV last night.</p>
<p>I was watching a newscast out of Baltimore, where Republican former governor Robert Erlich is announced he will take another run at the state house against Democrat Martin O&rsquo;Malley, who ousted him four years ago. At Erlich&rsquo;s announcement rally, cameras caught up with a black woman, in attendance, holding his campaign literature, and when they asked if she planned to support him in November she turned her face away from the camera and said &#8220;Um&hellip;I&rsquo;m undecided.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baltimore is my old home town, and I&rsquo;ve seen this before. When O&rsquo;Malley ran for mayor against black incumbent Kurt Schmoke, blacks supporting him openly faced ridicule and attack from their peers, and in some cases I knew, ostracization from their own families. O&rsquo;Malley won because the black vote was split between two candidates.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to blacks who backed Erlich over Democrat Kathleen Townsend for governor in &#8216;02 (including a prominent local radio host), or Erlich over O&rsquo;Malley in &#8216;06.</p>
<p>gg 2 6:20-</p>
<p><i>In Texas, they are even running Republican primary candidates against Ron Paul.</i></p>
<p>That actually makes perfect sense, since the Tea Party&rsquo;s principle focus is on wasteful government spending, and Ron Paul is a pork barrel spender tried and true (seriously, if you&rsquo;re going to use federal tax funds to buy security cameras for a townhouse development in your district, at least don&rsquo;t insult my intelligence by telling me you&rsquo;re a constitutionalist). </p>
<p>Also, Dr. Paul is less than great on the border and not much of a race realist himself.</p>

		<p>I agree 100%.  Even Malcolm X, when he admitted there were whites who were sympathetic to the black cause, did not want whites in his movement.  He said there would get to be too many whites and it wouldn&rsquo;t be black-centered enough.</p>
<p>The same is true with the BNP or any other group that is filled up with mostly white conservatives.  They&rsquo;re so scared of being called racists that they don&rsquo;t just ignore the slurs and push for the limited government that they set out to.  To paraphrase James Edwards of the Political Cesspool, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t need blacks to validate my views.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Poster #16   &mdash;   I am simply being realistic.  A third party will only split the conservative vote.  I agree that the Republican Party is not truly a conservative party.  However, it IS an ESTABLISHED party, not a renegade 3rd choicer.  The Tea Party alone has no chance of winning a national election, and we who are opposing the Democrats need to win by whatever means necessary, including joining forces with the Republicans.</p>

		<p>Before some of you give &#8220;Glad I&rsquo;m Southern&#8221; the inevitable grief for his or her own pragmatism about the GOP vs a potential Tea Party as a third party, remember that he or his is a Southerner, and the recent political history of the South, post-Voting Rights Act, is one where white voters have had to chuck it up and vote Republican (in spite of their pro-corporate elitism and its being the Party of Lincoln) in fear of black/Democrat rule.  Third parties do least well in the South, because the blacks have the Democrats, why should they vote 3rd party?  So the only kind of people that could vote for a 3rd party are the whites, and they know that voting for a 3rd party is the equivalent of voting for a black/Democrat.</p>
<p>You can have a Jesse Ventura winning Governor of Minnesota   &mdash;   that could never happen in Mississippi.  There is no racial consequence to &#8220;throwing away your vote&#8221; in Minnesota.</p>
