<h1>Great Opportunity for Black Male Teachers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jackson Sun (Tennessee), April 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Jackson-Madison County, black men make up only about 5 percent of the school system&rsquo;s 1,140 teachers. Nationally, black male teachers make up only about 1 percent of the nation&rsquo;s 3 million K-12 teachers.</p>
<p>School systems heavily recruit black male teachers, but the pool of potential recruits is too small. Therein lies a unique opportunity to recruit black males into the teaching profession.</p>
<p>Educators largely agree that black male teachers are important to young black males who lag significantly behind their white peers in academic achievement and in high school graduation rates. Black male teachers are important role models and mentors for young black males. They often have a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by young black males and can be in a stronger position to counsel and guide troubled black youth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The demand for black male teachers is high. But first the education pipeline must be filled with aspiring black males. That will take time. Before that can begin, there must be a major push to attract black males to the profession. {snip}<br>

		<p>If black boys need black men as teachers to succeed, then this theory is very testable.  It says here that the Madison County TN system has 5% black teachers, and the national average is 1%.  Therefore, Madison Co. TN&rsquo;s black male students must be doing much better than the average for black boys. </p>

		<p>You can fill &#8220;the education pipeline&#8221; with all the &#8220;aspiring black males&#8221; you want.  You can give them full scholarships, you can artificially inflate their grades so that they all graduate with honors. There is only one little problem.</p>
<p>Teacher licensure under No Child Left Behind dictates that prospective teachers pass a series of tests which demonstrate subject matter proficiency.  These tests, while relatively easy for most white students, will prevent the great majority of black males from entering the teaching profession.  </p>
<p>Prospective teachers must also undergo state and federal criminal checks which will also eliminate many black males that have be in the criminal justice system at some point.</p>
<p>However, these hurdles for black male teachers could easily be eliminated by a government committed to diversity in the classroom, and to be honest, I expect that will be the case in the near future.</p>

		<p>Blacks have had 40 YEARS to educate themselves for careers in fields such as teaching - and they haven&rsquo;t done it.  Only a very small percentage of them even finish high school, at least in SoCA here.  So obviously the &#8220;pool&#8221; of available black male teachers is gonna be pretty slim pickin&rsquo;s anywhere in the country.  It is the responsibility of BLACKS to get themselves an education.  White people are not responsible for the blacks&rsquo; refusal to perform.  Blacks have been whiners ever since slavery days - it&rsquo;s always &#8220;the white man&rsquo;s fault.&#8221;  Well, if we could deliver a 4 year college education by means of an enema, we&rsquo;d do it, and blacks would receive primary attention for that procedure.  Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t; and the blacks still whine and refuse to do the work that would qualify them for decent careers.  It&rsquo;s THEIR choice.  Do we really need more than 40 years to prove this point???</p>

<p>Well, as the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; might say, let us &ldquo;break it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.) &ldquo;Educators largely agree that black male teachers are important to young black males who lag significantly behind their white peers in academic achievement and in high school graduation rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A.) Thus being &ldquo;important,&rdquo; should they not only be directed at &ldquo;educating&rdquo; young black males and not the rest of us? Come on now, it is a given; so &ldquo;much&rdquo; has been taken from black men, is it not time for them to non-criminally, give something back besides their &ldquo;units?&rdquo; Sort of the way, they rape other men in a prison? Indeed, &ldquo;young black males,&rdquo; seem to need tutorials in that form of &ldquo;romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.)  &ldquo;Black male teachers are important role models and mentors for young black males.&rdquo;</p>
<p>B.) As if, the ANC terrorists were not &ldquo;important role models and mentors,&rdquo; toward destroying an entire country?  Oh wait, they are; silly me.</p>
<p>3.) &ldquo;They often have a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by young black males and can be in a stronger position to counsel and guide troubled black youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>C.) C is for Communists, like the white ones I always thought were so &ldquo;better able to counsel and guide troubled black youth,&rdquo; no matter what.</p>
<p>What am I missing here?</p>
<p>Oh, I know: God help us all!</p>

		<p>There they go again, they ALWAYS compare blacks with Whites. Asians and usually Hispanics ALSO do better than blacks. They came here without even speaking English and from different cultures, and they STILL out perform the blacks that have been here for generations. Why&rsquo;s THAT never brought up! Why do Asians and Hispanics not have a problem learning from teachers who &#8220;don&rsquo;t look like them&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Why would a Black man want to become  a teacher when far better jobs are available?<br>
If he has the ability to be a poor teacher, he can, for example, become an assistant  director of Diversity somewhere. If he has the ability to be a good teacher, he can be a moderately competent attorney. He also knows that the young Black males that he will be teaching are mainly incorrigible and will give him little respect, but much aggravation. Their role models are hyper-successful criminals, athletes, and entertainers, not Black school teachers, whom they regard as &#8220;oreos&#8221;, at best.</p>

		<p>I think that the teaching staff should reflect the exact percentages of the races of the local population.  Race, gender, socio-economic background, whatever.</p>
<p>Then, when the results are exactley the same (or worse), then we can go to segregated classrooms taught by people of their own race.  Then scores will rise, by the theory posited in this article.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, most teachers in Detroit are all black.  How are the scores over there?  What, are you being raciss&rsquo; and saying that black teachers are not as qualified or as good as comparable non black teachers?</p>

		<p>Just think of it as yet another White &#8220;racist&#8221; ploy. </p>
<p>Seriously, I can&rsquo;t understand WHY a White man or woman would even want to try teaching in today&rsquo;s public schools. With the cards so obviously stacked AGAINST the teacher. You have &#8220;diversity&#8221; to contend with, the mentality, disruptive and often anti-social behavior of minoriy members. On top of those problems, the reality the teacher is held accountable (blamed) for poor performance by minority members.</p>

They want black males a teachers and role models but we can&rsquo;t have segregated schools, which, if the theory is true, would produce exceptionally well performing black males.</p>
<p>Do any of these people involved in educating blacks talk to each other?</p>

		<p>Good.  I hope that all college &#8220;educated&#8221; black males become teachers in inner-city black schools.  Then they can deal with their own kind and leave the rest of us alone.  Besides, it might be a great chance for them to connect with all the fatherless ghetto kids who&rsquo;ve never seen a gainfully employed black man before.  </p>
<p>Most black males won&rsquo;t make it through a BA and pass the teaching credentials test, of course, so they should create a special 2 yr degree education degree that <i><b>only</b></i> allows them to teach black students.  Win-win scenario for everyone!  </p>

		<p>9 Anon and 10 Flying Tiger have their fingers on the core of the problem.  Any Black man who can collect a college degree can get an affirmative action job for higher pay than teaching and no real work.  If a Black man actually has the brains to be a first rate teacher, he can go to law school and get an even higher paying affirmative action job.  And if he really wants to teach, there are white schools that will gladly hire him, and he will have real students instead of a class full of thugs, hos, and dullards.  After all, isn&rsquo;t escaping the ghetto why they go to college in the first place?  </p>

		<p>This is a bit O/T, but since this thread is winding down, I want to see if I&rsquo;m right or wrong about something.  The issue was raised here a few weeks ago by either Bon, or Jay, or another poster who is a teacher.  The point he or she made was that a lot of these high schools in black areas have fancy names, but it&rsquo;s all window dressing.  The poster cited an example in his or her area, of a school named &#8220;Math, Science and Technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know what the poster was talking about, because St. Louis must be the mecca for these sorts of schools.  It&rsquo;s so common that there&rsquo;s pretty much a standard formula for these names.  If you happen upon a school whose official name looks anything like this, run for your life:</p>
<p>The (fill in the blank*) Comprehensive Magnet Academy for Math, Science, Technology, Career(s), Communication, Leadership and The Arts Community Education Center</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be just a &#8220;school&#8221; anymore, because just calling a school a school isn&rsquo;t conducive to the self-esteem of disadvantaged teenagers.</p>
<p>* - Fill in this blank with the name of the following kind of person:</p>
<p>- Someone who attended a black civil rights protest at a corporation to demand more minority hiring, then parlayed that into 20 terms in Congress.  He or she was assured re-election every two years, but never did boo for his or her constituents   &mdash;   It was pretty much the responsibility of a neighboring Congressman and his staff to chase down his old people&rsquo;s missing social security checks.  But the neighboring Congressman doesn&rsquo;t get a comprehensive whatchamacdoggle magnet academy named after him.</p>
<p>- A black woman who showed up more days than not to her public sector job, and in a given day, was at her desk a little more than half the time.  However, she was the first black women to get a public sector job in her city, defying all those hate mobs and segregation in the process</p>
<p>- A miscreant who first made a name for himself by acting outlandishly at a public meeting, then committed enough felonies to get a few years in the state pen.  While at the state pen, he converts to Islam in order to conceal the rap sheet earned under his birth name.  When he gets out, he starts a service to mentor troubled &#8220;youffs,&#8221; half of whom will end up doing time in the state pen.</p>
<p>- A &#8220;community activist&#8221; who complains about the sad condition of her public housing, and various leftist agitator groups pay for her travel and expenses all across the country so that she can tell groups and legislative committees about how bad public housing is.  Not one of the rich people paying her freight has ever thought to use that money to get her out of public housing.</p>
<p>- Any given AME preacher whose theology degree came from a cracker jack box.  Church-state separation is not an issue because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>- A former white liberal Democrat President or Governor</p>
<p>- A 7-year old girl who tragically placed herself directly in between two black thugs, one of whom had a gun.  After she is murdered, the police melt down all their confiscated illegal guns, and those remains are used to create a statue of the girl which resides in a public park.  The politicians and police chiefs use the opportunity to whine about the evils of guns, but have no problem with the people who used said guns.</p>
<p>- Ten years from now, Barack Obama</p>
<p>- Twenty years from now, Michelle Obama </p>

		<p>I worked in a school with a black vice-principal. Any outgoing work that he produced HAD to be edited and proofread (including e-mail). He could not string together enough of the right words and little squiggly marks that are used in sentences to make any kind of sense. He also stole a lot of copy paper. (I don&rsquo;t know why&hellip;) </p>
<p>The black kids loved him. They identified with him. He held sway with them AND their mommas. </p>
<p>He just keeps going up, up, up the education promotion ladder. Lord only knows where he&rsquo;ll eventually wind up. </p>
