<h1>NYPD Seeks Suspects in LES Bias Attacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Magee Hickey, WCBS-TV, April 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Five women were attacked [on the Lower East Side], police say, and all the victims are Asian, but that&rsquo;s not the only coincidence.</p>
<p>Police say the five assaults on Asian women took place over the last ten days within a nine-block area right near the Williamsburg Bridge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police want to question two women captured by the surveillance video because they believe they may be the ones assaulting the victims. Police believe they are part of a gang of five, where the three men in the group watch the females commit the hate crimes.</p>
<p>The group was captured by surveillance cameras at 1:20 a.m. at the location of the first attack, in the Gompers Houses at 90 Pitt Street. The victim in that first assault on March 31 was a 50-year-old Asian woman.</p>
<p>Later the same day, at 9:20 p.m., police say a 60-year-old Asian woman was assaulted at the Baruch Houses, in the back of 577 FDR.</p>
<p>According to police, a 71-year-old Asian woman was then assaulted opposite 120 Baruch Drive, also at the Baruch Houses. And so was the next attack, on a 66-year-old Asian woman at 95 Baruch Drive.</p>
<p>The last attack, according to police, was on Monday in front of 247 Broadway at 11 p.m. The victim was a 68-year-old Asian woman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police say the group physically assaults the women, but they don&rsquo;t take any money or property.</p>
<p>Because all the victims are Asian, the NYPD&rsquo;s Hate Crimes Task Force has been called in to investigate.</p>

		<p>On San Franciscos 3rd Street light rail, which grazes Hunters Point, mobs of black youffs have been beating asians, mostly Chinese, and all of them female, elderly or frail. None of them were robbed, and one of them, an 83 year old, died as a result of such a beating. At a meeting about this, one of San Franciscos finest po-leece officers said with a straight face tgat these attacks were NOT racially motivated.Political correctness at its best.</p>

		<p>I live in NYC.  I can guarantee you as sure as Tuesday follows Monday that if they were targeting White women there would be no &#8220;Hate Crimes Task Force&#8221; involved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share an incident that I experienced in the NYC subways.  This is by no means the only incident of this kind.  I had gotten on a subway train at around West 4th St. which is near the &#8220;Village&#8221;, meaning Greenwich Village where all the gays, lesbians, Blacks, extreme liberals, and other Bohemian types cavort.  I had just gotten on the train and accidentally bumped a seated Black man while moving through a train car.  The Black man held out his leg in an obvious attempt to trip me and nearly did.  He shouted an obscenity at me as well, and me, being no wimp &#8220;Wanted&#8221; to respond but something held me back.  I just kept walking.  I stopped near one of the doors and stood there.  I looked around and I noticed that the White people on the train were staring at me like I WAS THE BAD GUY.  This is when I realized that it was a good thing that I didn&rsquo;t respond, because these people would more than likely have taken the Black&rsquo;s side.  The White people on the train were your typical Bohemian liberal New York City types who fawn over Blacks.  I realized at that moment just how far gone some Whites are.  They have no sense of who they are.  Now keep in mind that I live in this city and hopefully I won&rsquo;t be living here much longer.  But it is just so incredible the way Whites have been conditioned to dislike themselves and support every other race but themselves.  I&rsquo;ve also seen more than one White person being harassed or attacked by Blacks and in every single case if there are Whites around they do absolutely nothing.  The Blacks on the other hand ALWAYS SUPPORT THE BLACK - RIGHT OR WRONG.  Really, something needs to be done to get White people to re-arrange their thinking about who they are and what is being done to them.</p>

		<p>I was watching the Noon time News when reports of a BIAS ATTACK against Asian women were teased. It is cringe inducing because if the assailants  were white there would be a whole morality tale and fear inducements, that is there is an implication that there could be more of these attacks by evil white folks. <br>
In this case it was black youths. Must be the result of 500 years of persecution, Jim Crow, etc. <br>
Later on in the day there was another report of bias arrests in Staten Island. Uh Oh I&rsquo;m thinking, must have been bat wielding Neanderthal Italians (one of the few ethnic groups it is OK to disparage in polite society). It turns out it was bat wielding blacks and  even a Hispanic targeting a Mexican:<br>

		<p>Now leftist multicultralists will blame the White man for oppressing blacks which compels them to victimize other minorities. Im not kidding at all and I&rsquo;m sure that if some pundit notices these crimes that will be the main thrust of the argument. </p>
<p>The reality is that many blacks will victimize anyone percieved as weak. How brave of them to attack elderly Asian women. </p>

		<p> Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how the TV news report carefully tap-dances around the issue of the race of the perpetrators? If the video had showed White thugs, does anyone think that wouldn&rsquo;t have been in the lead sentence of the story? Ah, yes, how circumstances alter cases, to quote an old saying.</p>
<p> These quotes from the area residents about how the polyglot community is &#8220;quiet&#8221; and supposedly everybody gets along so well, are rather disingenuous, too. It wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;quiet&#8221; and friendly for those Asian women, now was it?</p>

Oh &hellip;&hellip;I think I saw them running through the screets of NY firing shots at everyone the other night.</p>
<p>Anyways:</p>
<p>With King Oshama sitting atop the throne I suspect these types of attacks may just grow and manifest their way through every community that comes into contact with blacks. As of now I have heard of no arrests in the rampage they put on Easter night through the streets of NY after the car show. Yahoo mentioned it as groups of &#8216;youths&rsquo; &hellip;.. naturally. I do not see things improving in the immediate future. </p>

		<p>Has anyone ever noticed that blacks such as these, and the &#8220;gangsta&#8221; rappers always make sure they commit all their<br>
tuff guy acting in places that are both extremely liberal in nature and have strong gun control? Seldom does it seem that you see this happen in Texas, or other states with a strong gun culture. Maybe in the big cities, but I don&rsquo;t think you will see it there either; too many CCW people visit the city!!!<br>
When it happened a few months back, I thought that if Chris Brown has started to beat up his girlfriend (Rihanna) in any city in Texas, we would no long be &#8220;blessed&#8221; with his music. Some man or woman who doesn&rsquo;t think men(of any color) should hit women would have stopped him&hellip;.one way or the other.</p>

		<p>Where I live (NYC) there is a huge Asian enclave.  I mean they have soemting like 200 blocks in every direction where 80% of the people you will see are Asian of one kind or another.  The rest are old white or jewish folks and an odd Indopak or latino here and there.</p>
<p>There are no blacks anywhere except for the black kids who come in from the ghetto areas for school and then go back home.</p>
<p>Asians have no time for blacks, do not hire them and never, ever socialize with them.  How come they can get away with this but we can&rsquo;t?</p>

		<p>Peejay, didn&rsquo;t the SF Chronicle also report that a number of businesses in SF are taking part in a safe haven program, providing places where Asians can run to in order to escape being  victims of crime, and that this program has reduced crimes against Asians by 40 percent?  (I&rsquo;ve searched for the link to no avail.)  How can they possibly say Asians are not being targeted then tout the efficacy of the safe haven program in the next sentence?  So are they being targeted or not?</p>

		<p>I just have to respond to #8 Anonymous.</p>
<p>I work in Pittsburgh, Pa. At a bar that I frequent, three Africans came in with shotguns and robbed the bar and all of the patrons about thirty minutes before I came in. The barmaid called the police immediately after the Africans left with their shotguns. The police came in shortly thereafter, and the patrons told the police that the Africans may still be around. The police responded that they had in fact talked to the three Africans with the shotguns before they came to the bar. The police said that they left the Africans go because they had no charges to hold them.</p>
<p>My point is that the police do not arrest Africans. The crime rate is not down. The arresting of the African criminals is what is down.</p>

		<p>The Dutchman who says that multiculturalists will blame whites for oppressing minorities, which forces them to victimize other minorities is definitely not kidding.  I once told a liberal preacher about a Asian girl who had often been harassed by Mexicans, and he spouted some garbage about the Mexicans treating the Asians the same way that Whites had treated their culture.  As if Mexicans wouldn&rsquo;t have a mean thought in their head if Whitey hadn&rsquo;t put it there.  </p>

		<p>You asked, &#8220;Why anyone would live in New York City, San Francisco or any major city where their chances of being a victim increase daily, is beyond me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hate to drag this into a discussion on &#8220;Urban Theory&#8221; (another fantastic leftist area of study that I just adore), but:</p>
<p>I live in NYC. Its the safest metropolis in the US. Why, you ask? Because Giuliani larded up the streets with more NYPD and then 9/11 happened and more cops were hired. I take a subway around 3pm to my college classes, when the nobly darker hued youths are let out of school, and the city pays for a few officers to just hang around. I like that. Its like having a ranger in the nature preserve. Good on you, NYC.</p>
<p>San Francisco is a completely different environment and I lived there for several wonderful years. It is an upper-class elitist White peninsula (Hi Nancy!) that is completely insulated from ethnic minorities, uh, for the most part. Well, at least from Africans, who are relegated to Oakland, across a vast and watery bay, and who only arrive in the city of SF to illegally collect their Above-Prime welfare payments. There is absolutely no threat of violence in SF. Even the crack dealers are nice and compliant shoe-shiners. And the Mexicans are just your cooks. And house cleaners. Actually, no, I only trust the Indians with that. You know, stealing and all.</p>
<p>Whomever knocked NYC and SF has obviously never been to either. Come on, Amrenners! Show a little worldly sophistication! </p>
<p>Whites are doing very well in the big cities that we created. Thank you very much. And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be moving to a small town any time in the near future. Whites create and sustain cities. Whilst blacks can only badly manage failed ghettoes.</p>
<p>AmRen should be more active in attracting more urban White members and contributors. </p>

		<p>There was something I noticed about the photo of the two black girls. I don&rsquo;t know if the picture was photo shopped but the girls appear to be relatively light-skinned blacks. I think some white people think that the lighter the skin of a black person, the nicer and more like them these humans will be. I wouldn&rsquo;t bet my life on it. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt for a moment that these may very well be bias-related attacks, although no evidence at all was given to support this.  But simply BECAUSE these were Asian women, it was ASSUMED that these are &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, and the police are proceeding accordingly.</p>
<p>If these victims had been whites, however, even in the presence of abundant evidence of racial motives, outright racial comments, slurs etc., these would all be dismissed as just &#8220;bizarre incidents&#8221;  which &#8220;had nothing to do with race&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Blacks hate Asians because the latter are living proof that success and prosperity is available to non whites in the US who work and study and obey the law. </p>
<p>Asian success is an affront to blacks, who pretend that only racism has held them back, not their own failings or limitations. </p>
<p>People are never angry at their &#8220;inferiors,&#8221; only disdainful or indifferent.</p>
<p>The kind of hatred that blacks feel for whites and Asians is the hatred that one feels for ones &#8220;betters.&#8221;</p>
<p>By pretending that blacks have the same intellectual (and hence professional) potential as whites and Asians, we have driven them collectively insane.  Ourselves, too.<br>

		<p>A similar phenomenon is happening in Auckland New Zealand,Polynesian gangs are targeting Asian women in carpark robberies.They model themselves on black American gangs and consider Asian women easy and lucrative targets.In one recent case an immigrant from China was run over by the robbers car and later died in hospital.The robbers are on remand awaiting trial,no prizes for guessing their race!                         The NZ police,who don&rsquo;t carry guns,have recently been issued with tasers.The people most opposed to this have been white liberals[we got&rsquo;em down here too!]the most notorious being Green MP Keith Locke-a former marxist revolutionary who infamously declared the Khmer Rouge government&rsquo;a great victory for mankind!&rsquo;So it&rsquo;s ok to murder millions but it isn&rsquo;t ok for police to use non leathal force?In my opinion it&rsquo;s long overdue and will be a big improvement on batons and pepper spray!<br>
If you&rsquo;re skeptical about any of this,google an NZ news site.<br>

		<p>These crimes are obviously hate inspired, and done for the fun of it.</p>
<p>And the victims are elderly, senior citizens in some cases.</p>
<p>That makes what is occurring even worse.</p>
<p>And is a racketeering conspiracy. Two or more persons getting together and agreeing to violate the civil rights of a person.</p>
<p>Smirking little evil thinking plain old ordinary bad persons. And you can get somewhat of an insight into their mentality by observing they without exception, pick on those who can&rsquo;t fight back.   It has often been noted by authorities that you can tell a lot about a perpetrator of a crime by observing who they choose for victims. Latent cowards who enjoy the pleasure of tormenting others. Bullies and very evil.</p>
<p>And because this is &#8220;people&#8221; of color attacking other people of color, Holder [ZANU-PF] cannot say this is NOT a hate crime.</p>

		<p>The Times Square riot over Easter was caused by The Auto Show held every year in NYC at Easter, just like the arson in Detroit every year is caused by Halloween, and guns cause crime. But these attacks on elderly Asian women is a mystery. Would anybody have a thought as to the reason or cause for these attacks?</p>

		<p>When similar attacks were being made against whites in downtown Denver last year, it took quite some time before the police decided they were actually racially motivated.  One wonders whether this trend by law-enforcement is laziness, stupidity, or departmental hamstringing caused by enforced Political Correctness, or some combination of all of these.</p>

		<p>A few years ago in Chicago a young white boy was brutally beaten by 2 blacks. It was quite obvious that it was a race-based crime. The 2 young gentlemen,though no doubt &#8220;frustrated&#8221; by racism,had the presence of mind to take the small boys cell-phone.  Thus it was proclaimed with a sigh of relief by the police that it was an RGB.(Robbery Gone Bad). Nothing to worry about. Happens all the time. tThe idiots were actually defending the two who had done the beating; they were arguing a case for the blacks!! The POLICE!! When did police get into Defense work?  Maybe this Asian lady attack was an RGB,too. Except they forgot to take something. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because the cops and the thugs in Detroit have something in common-they&rsquo;re both black.  Blacks, as we all know, look after another black because their black, regardless if he/she has done anything bad.  Especially if something they did bad was to a white person.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Police say the group physically assaults the women, but they don&rsquo;t take any money or property.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
This is exactly the same as another article that was run here a few months ago about similar assaults in Minneapolis/St. Paul by groups of young Somalis.  They seemed to regard it as a kind of harmless sport to attack and knock down passing whites   &mdash;   from elderly folks to little kids. It&rsquo;s only one logical step further for them to realize how easy it would be to rob their victims while down;  but they hadn&rsquo;t reached that step yet, and apparently it didn&rsquo;t occur to them that there was anything wrong with attacking strangers  on the street   &mdash;   so long as nothing was taken. Such simple minds! </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no black crime in S.F.? You must not have left your apartment too much during your time there. On your next trip out this way I suggest you take a stroll down 3rd St. toward Bay View and H.P.</p>
<p>I lived in the &#8220;historic&#8221; Fillmore (Fillmo&rsquo; as the locals call it) The incident that I will always remember is when the local youfs were holding one of their periodic dog fights (on the sidewalk, in the middle of the afternoon) and when one dog lost, its owners and the people who bet on it kicked it to death in the middle of the street. I called the cops, but I knew from long experience that the police didn&rsquo;t respond to calls from that neighborhood. </p>
<p>BTW, if H.P. is too far a journey for you, you could spend some time in the T.L. which is quite close to BART. An afternoon in the T.L. should make you rethink your assertion about S.F.&rsquo;s lack of black crime.   </p>

&#8220;The Dutchman who says that multiculturalists will blame whites for oppressing minorities, which forces them to victimize other minorities is definitely not kidding. I once told a liberal preacher about a Asian girl who had often been harassed by Mexicans, and he spouted some garbage about the Mexicans treating the Asians the same way that Whites had treated their culture. As if Mexicans wouldn&rsquo;t have a mean thought in their head if Whitey hadn&rsquo;t put it there.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a young Hispanic woman with whom I teach who, at a departmental meeting, commented that she was having problems remembering her Asian students&rsquo; names because &#8221; they all look alike&#8221;. Everyone at the meeting cringed at the statement but remained silent. I really like this woman but I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what would have been the reaction had that same comment come from a White teacher. <br>

		<p>To all the posters who addressed the issue of why people would live in NYC or SF or other big cities:</p>
<p>I grew up in small town American and moved to NYC in my 20&rsquo;s because - yes - that is where the money is.</p>
<p>There are still some good areas where whites predominate.  The key is to know where those areas are and to avoid the black areas.  Basically anywhere in northern Queens, Brooklyn down by the water or the yuppie or money areas of manhattan are okay.  </p>
<p>Whites also have a large enclave in the nothern Bronx.  Staten Island is mostly white, but it is very guido, if you don&rsquo;t mind that southern european sub-culture.  </p>
<p>Southern Queens is a wasteland of &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;  You can still safely move around in those spaces though briefly, due to the presence of some asians (of India) and others.  </p>
<p>Most of the south Bronx - you take your life in your hands there!  Mid-Brooklyn - don&rsquo;t even think about it!  Harlem is surprisingly okay, even though it&rsquo;s mostly black.  That may be due to American blacks being slowly supplanted by immigrant blacks, latinos and yuppies.</p>
<p>Today I went to the Scottish Day parade here in NYC.  Even though I&rsquo;m only 1/16th Scottish, I made a vow last year (after my pleasant surprise at a medieval fair in Manhattan) to go to (and take my kids) to every white ethnic parade, celebration, etc., so I can be reminded how strong our cultures of the past really were.  The way those Scottish drummers and marchers exuded cultural power was invigorating.</p>
<p>We can no longer display &#8220;American&#8221; values or pride, but they can&rsquo;t take away celebrating the cultures of our ancestors, because we can get&rsquo;em with diveristy and multiculturalism right back!</p>

Ha!  I guess you mean Tenderloin (not sure what HP is). I only know SF as a tourist, but my impression is that it&rsquo;s an open air insane asylum for every other moocher, junkie, and lunatic on the face of the planet (almost all of them black, by the way).  A place to be avoided at all costs! I can&rsquo;t imagine why anybody would want to live there. And speaking of costs, the prices are as insane as the people.</p>

<p>I really think you may be projecting there. The white people may have been staring at you to acknowledge what just happened. If I saw something like that I mostly likely would have stared and made eye contact with the white victim as well. If those whites are used to be around that sort of behavior you can be sure many of them are just as sick of it.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the Greenwich Village precinct is statistically one of the safest and best parts of the city   &mdash;   a choice area where many wealthy and famous people choose to live.  He was lucky to have ANY whites around in the subway, which would not have been the case in many other large areas of the city.

		<p>NYC Resident &amp; Sonya:  NYC Resident is right.  I have experienced the same thing amongst my fellow whites.  I believe it is a sort of survival mechanism&hellip; if the combatant black is focused on someone else, all the other whites breathe a collective sigh of relief that they are not the ones being terrified.  They are so scared of defending themselves, and in turn, being accused of racism, that they will turn against their own in support of the black regardless of who is right or wrong.</p>
<p>I am also a NYC resident.  I am originally from Staten Island.  Before moving here, I had visions of a cultured existence  &mdash;   sort of like the women in Sex + The City, I dreamed of a cosmopolitan lifestyle and an escape from the guido haven where I came from.  It has proved to be the opposite. </p>
<p>Crime here is rising and the quality of life is terrible.  It is overcrowded and filled with non-English speakers&hellip; Africans on the corner of my MILLION DOLLAR CONDO selling fake handbags, my neighbors speaking &#8220;their language&#8221; in the shared elevators, subways that never run on time&hellip; nothing is reliable here.

		<p>Regarding crime being down in large cities and up in smaller cities/towns mentioned by <b>anonymous at 9:36 PM</b><br>
https://crime.about.com/b/2009/06/02/crime-rates-drop-except-in-small-towns.htm<br>
I have not done the research but speaking from observation in the field, the blacks in the major cities are being transplanted to surrounding suburbs and small towns and hence crime there is increasing, albeit still tempered by the larger white population. <br>
I saw this myself in a large metro area. There are articles on the net regarding the problems encountered by small town police departments due to this demographic shifting occuring across the nation.<br>
More small white enclaves are being forced to buffer the damages and cost of black crime.And so this trend of resettling city blacks to suburbs will continue.<br>
Of course I expect that liberals will explain this phenom away.</p>

<p>Do go a little easier on them, Dave!   I understand your ire, but in the first place, &#8220;our founders&#8221; were not the ones who imported the slaves.   In fact, one of the first steps they took  after independence was to terminate the further importation of slaves.  As for getting rid of an institution that already existed and was by then deeply entrenched, that was a more difficult matter.  Jefferson approached the idea when he was governor of Virginia, but he encountered such intense resistance from the planters that he realized it was political suicide for any politician in a system which depended on votes.</p>
<p>As for the founders, they were only human and couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen all the possible developments that were to come.  But, on the whole, I think they did a remarkably good job. The USA that they created flourished for two centuries and became the greatest, richest country in the world, despite all its flaws. It has been a magnet and an inspiration for mankind.  It is, I believe, now the oldest continuous government in the world.  Those Founders  must have dome something right!   If I were to blame anyone, I would blame those who came after them, who didn&rsquo;t live up to the Founders&rsquo; high expectations and didn&rsquo;t deserve  (and haven&rsquo;t appreciated)  the country they were bequeathed.  They don&rsquo;t even understand what was meant by the words, &#8220;our progeny&#8221;.</p>
