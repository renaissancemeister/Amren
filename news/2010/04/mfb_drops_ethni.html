			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Schneiders, The Age (Melbourne), April 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE Metropolitan Fire Brigade has shelved its attempt to bypass equal opportunity laws amid intense criticism of its plan to give preference to multicultural and indigenous people in pre-employment training.</p>
<p>Last night, MFB chief executive Ken Latta said the decision to withdraw its application to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal was due to an &#8220;extraordinary reaction&#8221; to its plans, and &#8220;misconceptions&#8221; about what it was trying to do.</p>
<p>He said the MFB would lodge a new application at a later date as it was not possible to change the affidavit that had already been lodged with the tribunal. The MFB was seeking an exemption from the Equal Opportunity Act so it could give preference to indigenous and under-represented cultural and linguistic groups in pre-employment training.</p>
<p>Peter Marshall, the national secretary of the UFU, which had opposed the application, welcomed the MFB&rsquo;s decision. It comes after criticism from women firefighters at a separate plan to boost the number of women in the workforce.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see as this as a win for common sense  &mdash;  the female firefighters didn&rsquo;t want any special treatment and certainly they&rsquo;re the ones that know best,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And indeed, in relation to other groups within our society, we look forward to reinstating the program that we were jointly developing with the Brotherhood of St Laurence to reach out into communities where there are the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Marshall said that program that the MFB had &#8220;walked away from&#8221; would have provided real assistance &#8220;without lowering standards&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Latta said there was no attempt to undermine standards or the merit process through the VCAT application.</p>
<p>&#8220;If people from cultural backgrounds unfamiliar with firefighting as a vocation complete the pre-application program, they must still then apply and compete with other applicants in our recruit selection process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will then be placed on the order of merit. If they are high enough on the order of merit to get in our recruit program, they must then complete the full normal recruit training with all other recruits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Latta said there were no intention to outsource training, as the union had claimed, through its pre-employment training proposal with Swinburne University.</p>
<p>The MFB, which has fewer women firefighters and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds than other emergency services, says it needs to change its overwhelmingly white male workforce to better reflect the community and extend the safety message to migrant communities.</p>
<p>Mr Latta, who retires from the MFB today, said that when it lodged its new submission, the language would be &#8220;unambiguous for all&#8221;.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.  Do fires burn any less hot or less intensely if the firefighters aren&rsquo;t white men?  If a fire goes off in the domicile of a non-white, and white firefighters come, is their water less effective in dousing the flames?  </p>

		<p>Fire Departments tend to be one of the few places left where merit actually counts. I&rsquo;m sure this drive the &#8220;diversity kings and queens&#8221; absolutely batty. If you want to understand what it takes to make a top notch fireman, go to www.hulu.com and look up &#8220;The Academy&#8221;. The third season follows the training class at the Orange County Fire Authority. All of the 28 students are male, one is Asian, a few here and there are Hispanic, but the rest are white males. </p>

		<p>As one of the female firefighters put it:</p>
<p>&#8220;I worked very hard to succeed in the application course. I received no special assistance &hellip; I met the same standards applied to every applicant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of this, I have earned the respect of my colleagues and am a valued member of our team &hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If women, or any other minority group, become targeted for recruitment, our respect is taken away &hellip; Our job, that we love, will no longer be a place of equality but the opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Pretty much sums up why affirmative action is evil. </p>
