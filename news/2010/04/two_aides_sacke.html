			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gary Anderson and Will Payne, Daily Mirror (London), April 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The racist BNP is in turmoil after losing three senior officials in a bitter internal feud.</p>
<p>Leader Nick Griffin was forced to fire two aides and a third stood down after allegedly plotting a &#8220;palace coup&#8221; against him  &mdash;  leaving the far-right party&rsquo;s election campaign in tatters.</p>
<p>BNP propaganda printer Mark Collett  &mdash;  twice exposed in TV documentaries as a racist who admired Hitler  &mdash;  was publicly dumped after he was named as the chief conspirator.</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s crucial national election organiser Eddy Butler was also sacked from his paid role and staff manager Emma Colgate has quit.</p>
<p>The turmoil, less than five weeks before polling day, is a huge blow to Griffin&rsquo;s hope of winning the Westminster seat of Dagenham, currently held by Labour&rsquo;s Margaret Hodge.</p>
<p>Griffin was already under pressure after his disastrous Question Time appearance last year and damaging allegations that he had cashed in on the European Union expenses &#8220;gravy train&#8221; since becoming a Euro-MP.</p>
<p>He has now been summoned to a crisis meeting of the party&rsquo;s influential National Advisory Council.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Searchlight, the anti-fascist organisation, said: &#8220;Griffin is really on the ropes.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Question Time appearance was an embarrassment and BNP members have been asking the same questions as everyone else about his EU expenses. He is struggling to hang on to control of his own party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Details of the &#8220;plot&#8221; emerged this week when high-ranking BNP organisers received an unsigned open letter outlining the details of an investigation by the party&rsquo;s internal security team.</p>
<p>It claimed evidence had been uncovered of &#8220;financial irregularities&#8221; relating to the printing of election leaflets and the party&rsquo;s bile-filled Identity magazine.</p>
<p>It said BNP printer Collett, 29, had been &#8220;relieved from all positions within the party&#8221; and accused him of plotting with &#8220;a small clique&#8221; to oust Griffin.</p>
<p>The party released a statement on Friday saying Emma Colgate had &#8220;decided to step down&#8221; to concentrate on her bid to win a Westminster seat.</p>
<p>BNP insiders told the Sunday Mirror Butler  &mdash;  who was central to the party&rsquo;s national election campaign  &mdash;  has been replaced by North-West organiser Clive Jefferson.</p>
<p>The damaging feud follows months of discontent about Griffin after his disastrous Question Time appearance.</p>
<p>Ordinary members have been infuriated by recent revelations that a handful of Griffin&rsquo;s party favourites are being paid generous salaries with EU money.</p>
<p>They are understood to be angry that Griffin insists on attending to &#8220;important business&#8221; in Brussels  &mdash;  where MEPs get £260 a day expenses just for turning up  &mdash;  instead of concentrating on the election.</p>
<p>A source said: &#8220;This could blow the party apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>BNP spokesman John Walker said yesterday: &#8220;We have no comment to make.&#8221;<br>

		<p>All political parties go through some editing, and if the BNP stays on message the comings &amp; goings of functionairies is not too important. We cannot know if those fired were deliberate moles inserted by the Left to sow dissension. The Left will no doubt present these changes as significant, but they needn&rsquo;t be if the leadership stays focused.</p>
<p>Some posters here may know that the John Birch Society, already reduced in strength, was further diminished a few years ago when a venal leader was forced out but mananged to legally hold on to major funding.</p>
<p>There is a lesson here for AR readers: Stop squabbling; keep your eye on the ball. When sympathetic partial partisans like Fred Reed or John Derbyshire offer us a friendly hand, some posters huff &amp; puff about them not being 110% in line with us. These posters micro-examine prepositions &amp; participles to see if our allies are pure enough. The Left is only too happy to see the disruption of petty disputes.   </p>

		<p>Based on what I can tell, the BNP is doing fine:</p>
<p>http://bnp.org.uk/2010/04/bnp-to-contest-326-seats-as-officials-unite-behind-nick-griffin-at-special-meeting/</p>
<p>Also, I think this is good, for I think Mark Collett was one of the last of the unreformed Tyndallites to remain in the party. He certainly was a bit of an albatross hanging over the BNP&rsquo;s neck. With him gone, Nick Griffin&rsquo;s vision is now absolute within the party. I think this year will yield even more successes for the BNP.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;It was also announced that former national elections officer Eddy Butler was still very much with the BNP&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty sad that he can&rsquo;t even get his basic facts right.  But what would you expect from a &#8220;journalist&#8221; that starts his article out with a slur.</p>

		<p>Look at the first two words of the article! Fighting for your own country and home is &#8220;racist&#8221;!? That pretty much sums up what passes for &#8220;journalism&#8221; in Britain today.</p>

<p>Lol! Ain&rsquo;t that the truth!</p>
<p>The phrase, &#8220;his disastrous Question Time appearance,&#8221; was used twice, and it&rsquo;s total baloney&hellip;Griffin was brilliant on that show IMO&hellip;rarely have I seen a person&rsquo;s words and behavior crafted more suitably and effectively to an occasion.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s quite infuriating how the BNP agrees with the far-Left and Muslims on Iraq and Afghanistan.  It even calls Afghanistan illegal!  The USA, Britain&rsquo;s NATO ally, is attacked by a terrorist group sponsored and hosted by the Afghan regime, which defies US demands to hand over the culprits.  The US activates the NATO charter, obligating allies to come to our defense.  In what sane world is the UK&rsquo;s fighting in Afghanistan &#8220;illegal&#8221;?   </p>
<p>The BNP goes on and on about it patriotism and the menace of Islam, but is the biggest party advocating the UK humiliate itself before its nonwhite enemies and abject surrender to the most vicious violent Muslims on Earth, with a proven track record of mass casualty attacks against Western targets.</p>
