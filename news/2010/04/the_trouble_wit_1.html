<h1><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/id/236002?obref=obinsite">The Trouble With Celibacy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Miller, Newsweek, April 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 1998 a Roman Catholic nun named Marie McDonald wrote a brief and painful summary of her concerns to her colleagues and superiors. It was labeled &#8220;strictly confidential.&#8221; She was worried, she said, about the sexual abuse of nuns by Roman Catholic priests in Africa.</p>
<p>The memo  &mdash;  titled &#8220;The Problem of the Sexual Abuse of African Religious in Africa and in Rome&#8221;  &mdash;  was concise. &#8220;Sexual harassment and even rape of sisters by priests and bishops is allegedly common,&#8221; it said. Sisters, financially dependent on priests, occasionally have to perform sexual favors in exchange for money. {snip}</p>
<p>Even as new cases of child sexual abuse by clergy emerge each day in Europe and the United States, abuse in the regions where Catholicism is growing fastest  &mdash;  Latin America, Asia, and, especially, Africa  &mdash;  are still largely ignored. In the West, the focus has been on the violation of minors, and on the role of celibacy in engendering this problem. In Africa, the problem is somewhat more complex. {snip} As the Roman Catholic hierarchy continues to crow over its success and vitality in the global south  &mdash;  the growth rate in Africa and Asia has been about 3 percent a year, twice the rate worldwide  &mdash;  the African church may put mandatory clerical celibacy to its harshest test yet.</p>
<p>{snip} The 2001 investigation by the National Catholic Reporter uncovered three separate reports of sexual abuse of religious sisters by priests. The story described priests raping religious sisters and then paying for their abortions; sisters fearing to travel in cars with priests for fear of rape; sisters appealing to bishops for help only to be told to go away. {snip}</p>
<p>Much less well documented is a broader problem: priests with unofficial &#8220;wives.&#8221; In Africa, &#8220;there&rsquo;s a tremendous problem with the vow of chastity in regard to women,&#8221; says Schineller. &#8220;{snip} Laypeople want priests, so they put up with the priest having a friend.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Schineller believes that priests all over the world fail to maintain their celibacy  &mdash;  more, he says, than anyone wants to admit  &mdash;  but that Africa presents priests with a unique set of problems. In Africa, parents have a higher social status than childless adults. &#8220;To be a man in Africa  &mdash;  it varies from culture to culture  &mdash;  but it is expected that you will have children and a family. {snip}&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Nuns hold a unique place in this sexual landscape. In a universe where AIDS is widespread, sex with nuns is thought to be safe; some imagine it might even have positive, healing powers. {snip} &#8220;One of the most dangerous myths in history,&#8221; adds Philip Jenkins, professor of history and religious studies at Penn State, &#8220;was this: if you were suffering from a serious sexual disease, sex with a virgin would cure it. That had awful consequences.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Celibacy is unnatural.  </p>
<p>Equally unnatural is trying to turn Western Christianity, as it is  interpreted in Europe, into a universal religion. Africans, Asians, and Hispanics will take from it what appeals to them, discard what doesn&rsquo;t, and practice the rest according to their distinct racial and cultural values.</p>
<p>Faith loses much in the translation across racial lines.</p>

I remember when John Paul died a lot of left-wing Catholics were calling for an African Pope to signal change in the church with regard to demographic shifts.  (You know, the same idea with electing Obama).  </p>
<p>The current Pope is up there in years, so when he goes, look for this same push.  If they heed this multi-culti advice next time, they could get this kind of thing at the HIGHEST level of the church.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Trouble with Celibacy&#8221;? This is AFRICA we&rsquo;re talking about, EVERYBODY south of the Sahara has trouble with celibacy, so why should the clergy be any different? </p>
<p>On today&rsquo;s AmRen index page, the news story right above this one is subtitled: </p>
<p><b>New York AG says AIDS spreader has &ldquo;deficits in self-regulation.&rdquo;</b> </p>
<p>These &ldquo;deficits in self-regulation&rdquo; are found in blacks everywhere. Some individual blacks (like that NY AIDS-spreader) are worse than others, obviously   &mdash;   but on average I don&rsquo;t think it can be denied that &ldquo;deficits in self-regulation&rdquo; (relative to any other ethnic or racial group) is a universal trait amongst people of African descent. It&rsquo;s a fault found clear across the black race. They just can&rsquo;t seem to control themselves   &mdash;   whether with sex or violence or spending or whatever   &mdash;   the way whites can. </p>
<p>I was about to suggest that Africans (esp. clergy!) need to learn to &#8220;keep it in their pants&#8221; when I remembered that before Bwana showed up, one of the many <i>many</i> MANY things the natives didn&rsquo;t have was pants. So I will instead suggest that Africans need to learn to &#8220;keep it in their loincloths.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I think the reason Catholicism is taking root in Latin America is because Indoamericans wrongly interpret the many sanctified and beatified individuals as other gods, and they wrongly interpret the Trinity as three Gods, so Catholicism seems to appeal to their polytheistic sensibilities.</p>

		<p>That these so-called men would use their status and power as respected members of the clergy to sexually abuse vunerable nuns is just disgusting. Priests, being men of God, are supposed to be role models and set an example.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the prevalence of this apalling behavior by African priests?</p>

<p>I believe the next Pope will be either a black African or Hispanic.  The reason I think that is because the College of Cardinals chose the former Josef Ratzinger to become Pope Benedict XVI five years ago.  B-16 was 78 years old at the time, which is rather advanced for a new Pope.  As such,Vatican observers think that B-16 is a &#8220;transitional Pope,&#8221; i.e. someone whose service will be relatively short, to give the Cardinals some time to think about the future of the Church.  I think they can see the demographic changes in the world.</p>

		<p>Perhaps it is no accident that Pentacostals and similar evangelical sects are growing rapidly in South America. What would be useful to know is the relative growth rates of such sects in Africa compared to Roman Catholicism.</p>

		<p>These people have all taken a vow of celibacy, and as Rush would say &#8220;for those of you in Riolinda that means they swore to GOD they would refrain from sex forever.&#8221; Christianity is not supposed to be a religion, rather it should be a way of life. Those who claim to be servants of GOD and do these things, are going to recieve far worse punishment for making a mockery of HIM. Far worse yet when it is{dare I say, HOMOSEXUAL sin, and even greater yet when it includes children. For who do you think said, &#8220;Woe to him who harms one hair on one of these little ones head? Also who said &#8220;don&rsquo;t even swear by the hair on your head, for he alone knows the number, and just a simple yes will suffice.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Celibacy appears to be attained and promulgated by time tested<br>
procedures, of which strict dietary practice is perhaps basic.<br>
Nicole Daedone has refined some behavioral-meditative practices <br>
into what appears to be optimization of hedonism.  But directed to a different aim, such modification can probably nullify the primate reflexes of sex and anchor sexual responses to  a mediative-cerebral control level.  Ms. Daedone claims to be able to modify female orgasms into &#8220;slow sex&#8221; that is rather shrub level sustained mood elevation of as long as 10 minutes or so  &mdash;  not the tree-top primate nerve convulsions of five or six seconds of a verbalizing primate&rsquo;s  conventional orgasms.  It may be that a truly radical political nexus is possible here, the central element of which would be a eugenic sexuality in which actual human procreant sexual intercourse could attain the status of a religious ritual and in which, too, a semi-celibate self-sexuality could complement widely expanded plural marriage.  Our American interplay between religion and sexuality has entertained Europe for 400 years.  Synthesis time has arrived perhaps    Celibacy unnatural?  For monkeys and dogs.      <br>

		<p>All of my graduate degrees are in Catholic theology. My livelihood is as a Catholic Theologian at a university. I therefore have a dog in this fight.</p>
<p>The reason that Africans have a problem with celibacy is that the traditional African priest is supposed to have many, many wives. It is antithetical and strange for a priest to not control wealth, females and political power in their domain. And have many children. </p>
<p>Certainly the Catholic institution grew to become a massive political power in the middle ages. However, in the Modern Era this political power has shrunk into nonexistence. Call it &#8216;Secularization&rsquo; or the growth of democracies. There is no more ecclesiastical Church power. None. And that&rsquo;s a good thing. Westerners have become more civil. But our culturally enriching African neighbors have not.</p>
<p>African Catholics are as superstitious as they were with their own primitive religions. In fact, they are still flat out irrational Primitives. The Roman Church should never, ever seek to revitalize itself with those semi-hominids or it will be in a heap of trouble. Far worse than it is in today.</p>
<p>The Western Church dealt with this primitive thinking for centuries and eventually evolved from primitive symbolic thinking into an era of rationality which hopefully survives today among Westerners. We can&rsquo;t hope for the same for our wonderful, enriching neighbors. If Rome reverts to an African pope or episcopate then we are in for a significant challenge to Western rationality. The child abuse thing will be nothing compared to the massive abuses that occur in Africa.</p>
<p>Can you say, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s burn the Witch!&#8221;?</p>
<p>P.S. Google &#8216;Muti murders&rsquo; or &#8216;witches&rsquo; in Africa. Darwin awards abound.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Most of the abuse claims occurred when priests were admitted to seminary in junior high school. Today, (since the 70&rsquo;s?) you must have a college degree and evidence that you have had relationships with women. The child abuse scandal is OVER. It is the product of a far different era.</p>

		<p>What with the African traditional belief, sex with a virgin is a sure-fire cure for AIDS and STDs, this undoubtedly encourages pedophilia in African priests as well. We don&rsquo;t hear much outcry over it, most likely that pedophilia is so common-place as not to be considered worthy of comment.</p>

		<p>Rampant rape and rampant promiscuity is the norm in black Africa.  Black African priests will merely act out like their fellow blacks.  NO CULTURAL OR RELIGIOUS  WESTERN FACADE WILL CHANGE THE AFRICAN MORALITY OR BEHAVIOR.  But then, the Catholic Church doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind or do anything about kiddie diddlers amongst their ranks, so why would they feel any differently about black priests doing the same to mostly adult women? Nuns or not nuns.</p>

<p>Here, we&rsquo;re speaking of a population that has a long record of problems with discipline.   </p>

		<p>My theory on why the Catholic Church may have an African Pope in the near future is due to the rapid spread of Islam (in Africa).  Middle East petro dollars are being pumped into West African countries by the millions (for the purpose of building Mosques, etc.).  </p>

<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s not what it means.  That would be a vow of chastity.  A vow of celibacy is never to get married.  A priest who has sex has sinned, because sex outside of marriage is a sin, but he hasn&rsquo;t broken his vow.</p>
