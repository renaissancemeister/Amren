<h1>All White, and a Bit Green, in the Far Country</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Donaldson, Times Live (South Africa), April 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The decision to move, about 15 years ago, surprised relatives and friends in KwaZulu-Natal. But the Strydom family have had no regrets about their relocation to Orania.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we came here, it was like a fresh breeze,&#8221; Lida Strydom said. &#8220;But, you know, whenever we go back to South Africa, we are shocked by what we hear. It&rsquo;s all so negative. All the crime, the murders. We didn&rsquo;t want the children to grow up in such an environment. Here children can play in the street in complete safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if to emphasise the point, across the road, outside the office where Strydom edits Voorgrond, the newsletter of the Orania Movement, two boys were shooting at each other with toy pistols. One wore a Spiderman mask, the other a British constable&rsquo;s helmet  &mdash;  the only sign of visible policing in the town.</p>
<p>That Strydom should have spoken of Orania  &mdash;  located at approximately the geographical centre of South Africa, 160km south of Kimberley  &mdash;  as if it lay beyond the country&rsquo;s borders was surprising. After two days, however, and having grown accustomed to the place, what was instead striking was Orania&rsquo;s distinctive un-South African &#8220;otherness&#8221;.</p>
<p>The town appeared untouched by the decay and dereliction commonplace in the country&rsquo;s inner cities and other platteland dorps. It was free, too, of armed response patrols, security guards, razor wire and electrified fences. True, cynics may point out that it was also free of black people  &mdash;  but as a conservative, white, Christian Afrikaner enclave, it was free of many other South African communities as well.</p>
<p>The symbols of the old South Africa are easily found. On a small koppie overlooking the town, there&rsquo;s a monument featuring busts of, among others, Paul Kruger, DF Malan and, not surprisingly, Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of grand apartheid.</p>
<p>But the monument&rsquo;s centrepiece is a statue of a small boy rolling up his sleeves, preparing to do manual labour. The boy is symbolic of Orania&rsquo;s selfwerksaamheid, or policy of &#8220;self reliance&#8221; that ensures all jobs in the town, from management to manual labour, are done only by Afrikaners.</p>
<p>Easier said than done. As Strydom put it, &#8220;Afrikaners are not used to doing manual labour, and that was something we had to adapt to. South Africans cannot understand that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many South Africans don&rsquo;t get Orania either, and regarded the establishment of the town, or volkstaat, as an exercise doomed to failure, another trek into the wilderness of a repressive past.</p>
<p>But first-time visitors are surprised at the developments thrown up by what can only be described as a 21st-century pioneering spirit. Self-sufficiency has resulted in energy conservation. Some houses are off the grid, producing all their own electricity requirements.</p>
<p>The town is now in its 20th year, and much has happened since December 1990, when Professor Carel Boshoff, a former Afrikaner Broederbond chairman and Verwoerd&rsquo;s son-in-law  &mdash;  together with about 40 families  &mdash;  moved into the dilapidated 430ha construction camp they bought from the Department of Water Affairs after it was abandoned by the engineers and builders of the Vanderkloof Dam on the Gariep River.</p>
<p>Today Orania is home to about 1700 inhabitants, and covers about 3000ha, most of it agricultural land. There are two schools, Die Volkskool Orania and the Christelike Volks-Onderwys Skool Orania.</p>
<p>In April 2004, Orania launched its own monetary system, the &#8220;ora&#8221;, which is pegged to the rand. It is, according to Frans de Klerk, the chief executive of the Orania Movement, a system of shopping vouchers designed to keep capital circulating in the community.</p>
<p>Ora artwork reflects an Afrikaner culture that may these days be regarded as quaint: the 10 ora note features Racheltjie de Beer, the 12-year-old girl who sacrificed herself to save her brother&rsquo;s life; the 20 ora note features Trompie, a mischievous fictional schoolboy not unlike Richmal Crompton&rsquo;s Just William character; the 50 ora note has a Voortrekker girl reading her Bible; and the 100 ora is adorned with the town&rsquo;s symbol, the small boy rolling up his sleeves.</p>
<p>Orania&rsquo;s tourism industry has also grown rapidly. A four-star river spa and boutique hotel was completed last year, when the town&rsquo;s first registered tour operator was also launched.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of town, at the museum, part-time curator Dup du Preez complained that those many visitors who took Orania Toere&rsquo;s cross-town safari were seldom shown the museum with its remarkable collection of 19th-century rifles and muskets, and Boer War artefacts.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot to see in the town, but we&rsquo;re always last on the list of attractions,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;By the time they get here, the people are so tired they sommer just stay on the bus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next door to the museum is the town&rsquo;s radio station. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not very professional,&#8221; one resident said. &#8220;They still have a bit to learn.&#8221; (On air, a presenter was telling her listeners of her frustrating experiences with municipal officials in Bloemfontein.)</p>
<p>Across town, on the far edge of Orania, is a huddle of small prefabs and hostels known as Kleingeluk, and it is here that poorer residents are housed. Because it is often these residents who perform the town&rsquo;s manual labour, there have been reports of a form of &#8220;whites only&#8221; apartheid in the town.</p>
<p>Many of Kleingeluk&rsquo;s residents arrived in the town as indigents, looking for hand-outs. There were none. There was only work. Carel Boshoff IV  &mdash;  known as &#8220;Carel Vier&#8221; (Four)  &mdash;  explained that some of the young men came from extremely troubled backgrounds, and had been living rough or were former convicts.</p>
<p>Boshoff IV is the Northern Cape Freedom Front Plus leader and president of the Orania Movement. In our interview  &mdash;  on the day Eugene Terre Blanche was buried  &mdash;  he was at pains to stress that the AWB leader and his followers&rsquo; notion of a volkstaat was fundamentally at odds with the Orania concept, and nothing more than a longing for old-fashioned apartheid, or wit baasskap (white paramountcy).</p>
<p>His father expressed the same opinion. &#8220;(Terre Blanche) chose a path of confrontation, of conflict,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We wanted another way.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are still looking for that way. &#8220;You&rsquo;ve heard of the Balfour declaration?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>This was a formal declaration of policy in 1917, by the then British foreign secretary Arthur James Balfour, which favoured the establishment in Palestine of &#8220;a national home for the Jewish people&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;That declaration was instrumental in legitimising the establishment of Israel in 1948,&#8221; Boshoff said, handing over a computer print-out. &#8220;This is our version of the Balfour declaration.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a statement, made on June 4, 1998, by the then minister of provincial affairs and constitutional development, Valli Moosa: &#8220;The pursuit on the part of the Freedom Front and other Afrikaners to strive towards the development of a particular region in the country (&#8216;the North West Corridor&rsquo;) as a home for culture and language within the framework of the constitution and the Bill of Rights is in government&rsquo;s view indeed a legitimate pursuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the reverse was a map of the &#8220;particular region&#8221; that Boshoff, if not Moosa, had in mind. From Orania, it stretched all the way to the Atlantic in the west, and included the towns of Prieska, Britstown, Carnarvon, Williston and Calvinia.</p>
<p>That may never happen, of course. But the pecan nut cookies Boshoff served his guests  &mdash;  made from the produce of Orania&rsquo;s massive new plantation  &mdash;  were excellent. Of that there was little doubt.<br/>

		<p> If it succeeds, then you can bet that some of the blacks will want it. Not work for it, but steal it. White success can not be allowed to work in a black majority rule country when it can&rsquo;t even feed it own people and provide security for it people. <br/>
 I wish them luck and my prayers; what they are doing isn&rsquo;t wrong. It is what THEY want to do and how THEY want to live.<br/>

		<p>Like it or not, this is what the future holds. Blacks are going to continue breeding like rats until they cover all of the land and consume all of the resources earned by whites. the only whites who will survive will be the ones who hole up in white-only enclaves and wait out the inevitable starvation-driven die-off of the black race. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Actually, a &#8220;cynic&#8221; might point out the degree to which certain SA whites go to great lengths to deny the obvious fact that crime in SA ONLY comes from blacks and black influence and that, once that is removed, everything bad about living in SA vanishes.</p>
<p>A cynic might also point out the price these white SA people pay for that denial and suggest that it really is a simple choice.  Accept the obvious and act accordingly&hellip;.ir face eventual extermination.</p>
<p>The fact that Orania hasn&rsquo;t grown to accompasse 99% of the white SA population says something very grim about them.  That they choose the latter.</p>
<p>Think about this a second.  Alot has been said about the fact that white SA people can&rsquo;t claim asylum in nations like the US.  Yet, assuming anyone who chooses to could move to Orania, why don&rsquo;t they&hellip;..in great numbers?</p>

		<p>Orania is an inspiration for me, and will hopefully be an inspiration for American whites. I notice that the ethnonationalism they adhere to is something benign. No hatred, malice, or fascist-sympathies; it&rsquo;s based on a pure desire to preserve their own people and the history in their genes and culture. </p>
<p>I pray for the continued success of this community. </p>

		<p>One lesson often ignored is that cheap labor isn&rsquo;t cheap; it plants the seeds of the eventual transformation and destruction of a society. Short sighted greed by the avaricious minority seems to always gain the upper hand and leads to ruin.</p>

<p>This WAS a mistake the Afrikaner made during the apartheid days. The Afrikaner as BAAS and not reliant upon his own wherewithal was a wrong way? Even the boer, the farmer, primarily used hired hands? These Orania folks are on the right path. I wish them luck.  </p>

		<p>The people of Orania are right about whites doing manual labor.  The importation and exploitation of non-whites to do our work has been our undoing.  There are plenty of unskilled whites who could be janitors, lawn men, warehousemen, shop girls, etc..  Not to mention (in this country) where even the skilled jobs are outsourced.  It is time we went back to an age where men mowed their own lawns, women cleaned their own homes, and children walked or biked to school.  </p>
<p>No healthy man should be unemployed!  No woman who wants to work should be unable to find a job.  If we didn&rsquo;t import Mexicans, Indians, etc. we wouldn&rsquo;t have unemployment to the degree we do.</p>
<p>I hope and pray that Afrikaners get a homeland with ocean access.  And I hope they are smart enough to not allow in the white groups (such as the SA English) who helped bring their down fall.<br/>

		<p>As other readers point out, I also wonder how long it will be before the &#8216;gubbamint&rsquo; of SA casts its eye there and declares that it must open up to &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.  The gubbamint does have legal control over the entire landmass, and the masses of the impoverished voodoos will continue to grow and outstrip and food potential in the rest of the nation.  They must declare independence before it becomes too late to do so.  Take the western half or third of the nation and run.  Most of the voodoos live in the east and southeast anyway.  Pretoria is lost.  Leave it to the liberal British descendants so they can celebrate diversity.</p>

<p>Why? The blacks never attacked whites like an army. They go into the cities and attack whites everyday and do crimes.</p>
<p>But if they want to attack this city, they have to get in first. And because they can&rsquo;t they have to attack like in a civil war. And if they attack like an army, media will excuse them because they are hungry and so on&hellip; BUT they can not blame whites this time! <br/>
It would be a war. And the blacks started it. This would be the first time whites would be allowed to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore I can only advice Afrikaners always to ask in live interviews: &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t you report about the genocide of us?&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The Whites in southern Africa should have been independent from black labour and should have used means to control and later reduce the black population and at the same time increase the White population. Just like the highly fertile Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel who are encouraged by the state to have loads to children to counter the growing Arab population, the White governments should have encouraged conservative Whites (like these conservative Boers for example) to have as many children as possible. </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we move in great numbers to Orania?</p>
<p>Answer: Lacking logistics and infrastructure. It is still too underdeveloped to accommodate millions of people. It has the development level of a small town farming community, situated near the Karoo, a semi-arid dessert (which will cause natural restrictions, e.g. water). Google Orania, the Google Pretoria, then Johannesburg - and notice the difference. You won&rsquo;t be able to transfer a many times over billion dollar infrastructure to Orania, nor to the Western Cape.</p>

<p>Number 20 have it right, but infrastructures and economical opportunity has to be created over time it simply does not fall from the sky. Unfortunately it requires careful footwork, bigger population is only possible with more opportunities and infrastructure but these things are only created with a bigger population.</p>
<p>Then the labor issue, Afrikaners simply has to learn to work with there own labor, it poses somewhat of a cultural revolution, but it has to be done, without it all is lost. It should also be the biggest lesson to Americans and Europeans, now matter how resilient and strong a people might be, in the end demographics right history, not wars, not politicians, not morality, but demographics and only demographics. All nations that have used cheap foreign labor or slave labor eventually withered. I have great hope for Orania, from the few times I have visited the town it was defiantly growing, it me be in baby steps, it is not the size of there civilization but the direction of its growth and attitude of independence, which is nothing short of fierce.         <br/>

<p>This link shows where white South Africans live and only 20% live in the Cape Town/Western Cape area.  I can understand living in Gauteng/Johannesburg, but I can not understand why they would stay in Limpopo or Mpumalanga (based on geography).</p>

		<p>Re concentrating in Cape Town.</p>
<p>If you fly by plane over Cape Town (which I have done)and look out of the window (and then look at a Cape Town map) you will be surprised how many squatter camps are in Cape Town. A great part of Cape Town (and surroundings!) consist out of squatter camps.</p>
<p>Cape Town has a huge water problem. There is not enough water. Recently a new dam has been build and that resulted in the municipal rates for water (a sliding scale!) being increased rapidly and will be doing so for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>Going in the direction of George (you will have to google a map of South Africa) the water problem worsens. </p>
<p>Cape Town has not enough industry and one local inhabitant (who is in the marketing business) told me 2/3 of the Capetonians live in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>During 2009 crime has increased a lot and for the first time it made headlines that the police warned that people will have to sleep with their alarms on. In general the Cape Town home security measures are underdeveloped compared to Pretoria or Johannesburg. For instance most properties are not walled in.</p>
<p>For the argument that Orania can still be developed, and there I have not yet seen a formal study undertaken delimiting the maximum possible expansion prossibilities, I can counter that there is a very danger for what reader no. 1 mr./mrs. D.B. Cooper has written:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sooner or later, Orania is going to get in some liberal&rsquo;s crosshairs&#8221;.</p>
<p>And that the blacks will move after Orania job opportunities, should the region expand rapidly. The policymakers in Orania must take heed of this possibility. It might not be a wise policy decision to expand in such a manner that it will not become attractive to all kinds of unwanted elements. Orania is no country with an established police force and army.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am also stuck in this country. If there is an ultimate feasible solution, I will go full-steam ahead for it, for I have no suicidal tendencies.</p>
<p>Latest information I received is a report from a radio station that told that international furniture removal companies said that for every 3 families leaving South Africa, 3 return. Primarily due to the international recession, where foreigners visas get canceled first and that companies retrench on the LIFO (last in, first out) base.</p>
<p>It all is a big mess.</p>
