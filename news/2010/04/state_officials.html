<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State officials are trying keep a man busted for deliberately spreading the AIDS virus locked up past his prison term.</p>
<p>State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo&rsquo;s office has filed paperwork in Buffalo Supreme Court to commit Nushawn Williams to a mental hospital after his prison term expires Tuesday.</p>
<p>Williams, also known as Shyteek Johnson, served 12 years after pleading guilty to reckless endangerment and two counts of rape.</p>
<p>Despite knowing he was HIV positive, he had unprotected sex with 12 women in upstate Chautaqua county and a 15-year-old in the Bronx.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thirteen of Williams&rsquo; victims were infected with HIV, with two later passing it on to their own children.</p>
<p>Williams, 33, didn&rsquo;t change much behind bars, having thrown bodily fluids at other inmates and been sanctioned 21 times for violent conduct, threats, fighting, and possession of drugs and weapons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cuomo&rsquo;s team warns that because Williams served his full term  &mdash;  he had been denied parole three times  &mdash;  he would not be subjected to community supervision if released.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is sexually pre-occupied with having sex multiple times per day in the community with multiple partners and has deficits in self regulation,&#8221; Cuomo&rsquo;s office said in court papers.</p>
<p>State Office of Mental Health psychologist Jacob Hadden, who interviewed Williams last month, diagnosed him with a mental abnormality that would allow him to be civilly confined under the law.</p>

		<p>Thank goodness that the Obama health care plan will take care of these poor victims.  It can cost over a million Dollars to support each HIV/AIDS-infected person their entire life.  There are so many People of Color who are being penalized with the burden of HIV/AIDS.  Just think of the millions of poor Africans and Haitians who have contracted this dreadful disease   &mdash;   It would be very difficult for these poor people to pay for their treatment back in Africa and Haiti.  Thankfully, Obama has recently made it unlawful to bar immigration based on HIV/AIDs infection.  With open immigration and Obama-care, these victimized people can now find the life-long medical and social care they had previously been denied.</p>
<p>On another subject, for those few Americans who are still required to pay taxes (i.e., White people), please remember to pay them by April 15.  </p>

The Buffalo News ran with this headline:</p>
<p><b>AIDS predator may stay in custody indefinitely</b></p>
<p>The use of the word &#8216;predator&rsquo; and a picture of a black man is certain to prompt &#8216;outrage&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I am uncomfortable with mental institutions being used in this way. I would support this guy being locked up for life in solitary confinement in prison, to protect prisoners from aids. There should be a law which enables people like this to spend life in prison. Using mental institutions for things like this is unethical though.</p>

		<p>East St. Louis can do this worthy one better.</p>
<p>In 1997 (?), an 18-year old miscreant by the name of Darnell &#8220;Boss Man&#8221; McGee was murdered. Several months later, the public health authorities discovered that he was HIV+ and spread it to 100 girls and women, some as young as 12.  The next summer, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch profiles his home life.  They told us that &#8220;Boss Man&#8221; was one his mother&rsquo;s 21 children, they had beget 105 grandchildren, who had in turn beget 110 great-grandchildren.  12 years later, the last two numbers are surely higher now.  So from this one woman, in the summer of 1998, came 236 human beings, one of whom spread his HIV to 100 girls and women.</p>

		<p>I hope the AIDS predator DOES stay behind bars for the rest of his life!!!  Letting something like this loose on the streets is one of the most irresponsible actions that could be taken.  If they do that, then every non-AIDS-infected person in the U.S. should be allowed to carry a gun, and shoot the pig if he shows up.  We don&rsquo;t allow rabid dogs on our streets - this guy is worse, so why should HE be allowed to roam free?  Freedom is not something that should be given to incurable unrepentent sexual predators.</p>

		<p>The community organizer is pushing to allow people with aids into the country.  That&rsquo;s almost criminal.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty sure he wouldn&rsquo;t be advocating entry for them if the vast majority weren&rsquo;t black.  It&rsquo;s just another way the pro-black is in office to help his tribal kin, first last and always, before anything else.</p>

		<p>I certainly hope they lock him up forever, but a mental hospital is a terrible idea.  He may get access to vulnerable young women with mental disorders.  </p>
<p>Besides, black promiscuity and lack of impulse control is normal, not some special mental impairment.  Why do you think Africa has staggering AIDS rates and blacks in America have most of the STDs?  </p>

		<p>All of the young women and the girl who he infected were White girls. I guess that&rsquo;s what these wigger chicks get for sleeping with gangstas. Maybe we should publicize it so other White girls don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s so cool to get down with the local Black thug. </p>
<p>I say quarantine him. Public health authorities are allowed to quarantine people who are a menace to society due to their infectious diseases which they refuse to treat or negligently endanger others with. </p>
<p>Either that or ship him back to Africa, hopefully a country full of HIV-positive males who act just like he does, for instance, South Africa. He&rsquo;d be right at home there. This guy&rsquo;s obviously marooned on the wrong continent.</p>

<p>Yes, this is an example of conquering by out-breeding   &mdash;   a form of demographic warfare.  However, our government feels that the current Minority population is not breeding fast enough.  Therefore they have a program to also bring in millions of new, fast-breeding Minorities from the Third World, such as Somali, Cambodians, and Nigerians (ethnic-flooding).  That is why is formerly White communities in Maine and Iowa suddenly have large Minority populations.  It is also called White displacement or ethnic cleansing.<br>

<p>Does anyone remember that case of the Puerto Rican Woman who immigrated to NY City in the 1950s and immediately went on Welfare?  She then proceeded to have around 8 children, who likewise went on Welfare.  Those 8 children had something like 45 grandchildren, most of whom also went on Welfare?  In the end she produced over 50 Welfare dependents.  </p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate it if someone could post the actual facts, because the abvove is based on my faulty memory.</p>

		<p>Nice!  Civil confinement means that Williams won&rsquo;t be released until something like three different psychiatrists agree he&rsquo;s OK to let loose.  Since three head-shrinkers rarely even agree on where to eat lunch, Williams isn&rsquo;t getting out.  Curiously, I sometimes receive flak for having married a Japanese gal, as if Japanese and him are somehow equal.  It&rsquo;s one of those things that makes me go &#8220;Hmmmmmm.&#8221;</p>

There is precedent. I has been done.  The famous Typhoid Mary, a cook, upon being identified as a carrier of typhoid (which, because of her, had taken a number of lives)  was sentenced to be confined for the rest of her life.  And so she was. </p>
<p>In her case, she was entirely innocent of any wrongdoing. She was never accused of any crime.  The unfortunate woman  did not even know she was a carrier, and never intended harm to anyone. Nonetheless, in the interest of society, she spent the remainder of her life in confinement. The wellbeing of the majority must come first.</p>
