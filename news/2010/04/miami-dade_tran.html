<h1>Miami-Dade Transit to Remove &#8216;Offensive&rsquo; Islamic Bus Ads</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jaweed Kaleem, Miami Herald, April 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Miami-Dade Transit is pulling advertisements from 10 buses that South Florida Muslims have said are offensive to Islam.</p>
<p>The ads, which went up Tuesday, said &#8220;Fatwa on your head? Is your community or family threatening you?&#8221; and directed Muslims to a website encouraging them to leave Islam.</p>
<p>Robert Spencer, associate director of New York-based Stop the Islamization of America, which purchased the ads for one-month as the first leg of a national campaign, said they were &#8220;offered in defense of religious liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on Thursday, Miami-Dade Transit spokeswoman Karla Damian said that after reviewing the ads, the department decided they &#8220;may be offensive to Islam&#8221; and would remove them before the buses ran on Friday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The South Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations had critiqued the ads as promoting &#8220;bigotry&#8221; and making false statements about Islam.</p>

		<p>Well, CAIR is right in one sense:  it&rsquo;s a stupid ad.  The argument is, leave Islam (and one assumes become Christian) to escape a fatwa or threats from family.  That&rsquo;s a pretty stupid recommendation, and in fact would ENSURE that the person had a fatwa placed on him or her, and WOULD receive threats (of death) from family.  And THAT is NO lie or distortion of the truth, CAIR, and you KNOW that.  It&rsquo;s fact.</p>

<p>Absurd. Religious criticism is now &ldquo;bigotry&rdquo;? It has always worked hand-in-hand with the concept of religious freedom. I wonder if the ads had been directed at, say the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, if they would have been forced to be taken down? Stop the Islamization of America should try using roadside billboards and see if the same thing happens.</p>

		<p>Does everyone here realize that CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) is one of THE most subversive Islamic organizations in the U.S.?  If you don&rsquo;t know that, then you haven&rsquo;t been doing your homework.  I think the bus ad is dumb, too, BUT - I would take no action whatsoever on the advice of CAIR.  Make no mistake - CAIR&rsquo;s explicit agenda is to infiltrate U.S. organizations of every kind on every level, to take over the U.S. by force if necessary, and then to enforce Shariah law on the U.S. by whatever means necessary.  If you don&rsquo;t believe this, well, like I say, go do your homework.  Then do whatever you can to oppose CAIR.</p>

		<p>   The Immigration Bill of 1965 has truly allowed a cancerous Trojan Horse to take root and spread like a deadly virus within our own nation . This ideology makes the Soviets seem like fine folks . And now, even after 9-11, which was perpetrated in the name of Islam, even after the Fort Hood Massacre, which was perpetrated it the name of Islam, the FBI, under the prodding of the liberals(this administration and Janet Napolitano) apparently views the Tea Partiers with much more trepidation than they do Islam . The assimilation of America is nearly complete . We may as well go purchase our prayer rugs and resign ourselves to Sharia Law .</p>

		<p>I have a copy of the pre-9/11 NOBLE KORAN, published in Saudi Arabia.  The notes in it make it very clear that jihad requires automatic rifles and army tanks.  If I were to post photostats of these notes, would that be anti-Islamic?</p>

		<p>The sad thing about this is that a lot of kids who turn away from Islam will be killed, never knowing there are people out there who want to help them. That was the whole point of the ad.</p>
<p>The whole point of removing it is to enforce Sharia Law and approve of the murder of children for honor offenses, religious questions, etc.</p>
