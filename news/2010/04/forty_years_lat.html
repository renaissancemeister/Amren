<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The fortieth anniversary of African American studies at UC Berkeley is a milestone to be celebrated in every possible way. {snip} Grounded in the broader national and global struggle for human and civil rights, the institutionalization of Black studies at UC Berkeley created the space for black Americans (and other hyphenated Americans) to be included in the university curriculum. In the process, it changed the fundamental character of higher education forever.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1970, African American studies at UC Berkeley {snip} has become an interdisciplinary, multi-racial intellectual center that hosts, attracts and produces some of the most diverse, complex thinking, scholars and scholarship in the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black studies at UC Berkeley has come a long way since its first 30 courses were offered in the spring of 1970. Over the years, its faculty has also pioneered substantive programs and initiatives that have made the campus more diverse and inclusive. These have included the Black Cultural Center and partnerships with the Office of African American Student Development. Reaching across the campus, African American studies played a central role in the creation of the American Cultures requirement and continues to teach a disproportionate number of AC courses.</p>
<p>A trailblazer in African Diaspora graduate studies, the department&rsquo;s graduate program, when it was established in 1997, was only the third in the world offer a course of study leading to the Ph.D. in African American studies and the first to focus on the study of the African Diaspora. Since its inception, the graduate program has enjoyed a nearly 100 percent placement for its Ph.D. graduates, even in the some of the toughest economic times in history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fortieth anniversary of Black studies at UC Berkeley presents a unique opportunity to chronicle more than four decades of efforts to create a stable academic unit in the face of daunting challenges both within the university and without. Together, the African American studies faculty, staff, students and allies have weathered academic racism, helped prove to the world that black people are, in fact, worthy of study, {snip}.<br>

		<p>What skills and real-world experience does a degree in African American Studies qualify one for? I looked at the curriculum for African American Studies at Berkeley and it is apparent that if you passed the second grade and you can read, you can easily pass the African American Studies curriculum. At first I thought it had to be a joke. It is also the most blatantly racist curriculum I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life.</p>

		<p>Blacks seem to be blissfully unaware of their shortcomings&hellip;      <br>
	<br>
I&rsquo;m often attacked by blacks for citing research done by U.S. Department of Education or the US Census Bureau&hellip; many people of color would like to suppress the embarrassing information contained in these studies&hellip; it&rsquo;s not popular to say that blacks have enjoyed 50 years of special treatment through affirmative action and numerous other social programs designed to compensate for their inadequacies&hellip; blacks resent the fact that the U.S. Department of Education falls short of proclaiming the entire black population developmentally disabled&hellip; <br>
	<br>
But the truth is&hellip; black leaders are using these studies to ensure blacks continue to receive preferential treatment.<br>
	<br>
One could argue the blacks have been afforded unreasonable accommodation; continuing to indulge the blacks with the false perception of intellectual equality has undoubtedly hampered their decision making processes. <br>
	<br>
Whites must edify the blacks by telling them the real reason for their discrepancy in achievement is due in part to their narrow minded; often short sided views which tend to marginalize them as a people&hellip; this coupled with an inability to take constructive criticism has impeded their progress in many areas&hellip; whites are far more analytically with greater intellectual capacity, giving them the edge&hellip; whites achieve at much higher levels than blacks; it&rsquo;s imperative to recognize these differences before the Blacks can move ahead as a people.<br>

		<p>It produces some of the most &#8220;complex thinking&#8221; scholarship in the world? My immediate reaction to this was &#8220;Oh brother!&#8221; What does that even mean? This piece is muddled (and riddled with minor typos).</p>
<p><i>institutionalization of Black studies at UC Berkeley created the space for black Americans (and other hyphenated Americans) to be included in the university curriculum. </i></p>
<p>So is the writer admitting that the vast majority of blacks have to get their degrees in this airy-fairy field instead of physics, mathematics, computer science and the like? That I would agree with. </p>

		<p>This academic lunacy has been going on for four decades?  Hmmm, how time flies.</p>
<p>One wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that black &#8220;culture,&#8221; or black civilization, such as it was, would have warranted more than a brief mention in any college curriculum.  </p>
<p>These are a people with no history of a single written language, no scientific, technological, political, social, or significant cultural advances.  What&rsquo;s there to talk about beyond a single two-hour course at most?</p>

		<p>I do not begrudge anyone studying their own history and culture.  Go ahead and do it to your hearts content.  I just wonder what it is exactly that they study in Black history departments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking a mixture of:</p>
<p>history of Africa <br>
civil rights movement<br>
slavery<br>
music, dance, sports, African dance<br>
African myths and legends</p>
<p>Do you see what&rsquo;s missing?</p>
<p>Science, philosophers, political systems, discoveries, etc.</p>

<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that. I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure. I suspect they may be the last to be given up. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re approaching this from a logical point of view. But these are ideologists, to whom this is a religion, and they will hang on to the bitter end and never give up. They are not concerned about practical matters. They don&rsquo;t want to hear about money.  Logic is irrelevant to them.  If they had their way, they would sacrifice physics and math before black and women&rsquo;s studies.<br>
 It will not be an easy struggle and it remains to be seen who <br>

<p>Again, I disagree. </p>
<p>You can forget about high-tech, medical or scientific jobs, which can always be outsourced or given to special visa holders, but there will always be a demand for well paid Diversity Specialists and such.  At least as long as the political climate continues as it is. Ethnic consultants, immigration lawyers, community activists &hellip; as the US transitions from an industrial power to its new  &#8220;service economy&#8221;, the field is booming!</p>

<p>And why wouldn&rsquo;t it?  Any course for blacks on a grade school level is going to be popular.</p>
<p>The sad thing about the entire matter, however, is that blacks are so arrogant&hellip;and blind to their own limited intellectualism&hellip;.they preen and crow as if the people in the field of black studies are intellectuals equivalent to rocket scientists, instead of the mentally challenged fools they really are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been on this site before, describing themselves as &#8220;great scholars,&#8221; in terms that make them very close to illiterate.  It&rsquo;s both laughable and tragic at the same time.</p>
<p>As the above poster says, it&rsquo;s time for leftist whites to quit encouraging these people to make such fools of themselves.  It isn&rsquo;t good for anybody.</p>

		<p>Oh, is this what it takes to prove blacks are &#8220;worthy of study?&#8221;  The only good I can see in it (since it doesn&rsquo;t prepare any of its students for meaningful work) is that it is good for white people to sit in on so we know what is in the mind of the enemy.  Make no mistake, these people are as dangerous to whites as are the Muslims, and the more you know about your enemy&rsquo;s mindset, the better you can predict his/her behavior, and give yourself the advantage that way.  Of course, you might have to &#8220;sit in&#8221; on classes in blackface&hellip;.</p>

<p>I strongly dispute your claim that the black hustlers in the black studies departments are &#8220;mentally challenged&#8221;. Who do you think is paying for these black studies departments in our public universities? It is stupid white tax payers. The fact that black hustlers managed to convince white Americans to establish black studies departments in hundreds of American universities, is evidence of black intelligence. I have taught college courses in the sciences, in the American North-West, where there are very few blacks. Many universities in that region have black studies departments, where the majority of students taking classes are white. One of the whitest universities in America, the University of Colorado at Boulder, has offered black studies courses since the 1960s: http://www.colorado.edu/ethnicstudies/history.html</p>
<p>If you and I were asked to explain what black studies courses are good for, we would scratch our heads, and struggle to come up with an answer. But the article above on UC Berkeley says that graduates from black studies departments have a nearly 100 percent placement rate. Most white science graduates do not have a placement rate that is nearly as high. I know two computer programmers who are jobless.  </p>
<p>Apparently, there is a huge demand in the market for these black studies graduates. Major corporations are often expanding their ethnic diversity departments. Others are establishing new departments. As far as I am concerned, the scientific data claiming that blacks have low IQs is irrelevant. Blacks have managed to hustle white people into creating a huge diversity industry, that advances black interests at the expense of white interests. Now, which of the two racial groups is truly &#8220;mentally challenged&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;course work&#8221; appears to be suspiciously drug-like; it narcotizes, numbs, dumbs. Seems the drug fixes that plague the underclass black community now are making their appearance on campus, to bedevil the few who manage to get that far.<br>

<p>Your contention is not true.</p>
<p>Blacks are neither intelligent enough nor organized enough to overturn, displace or make demands of Whites without A LOT of help and A LOT financing from lefties. </p>
<p>The NAACP was not founded by blacks:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A bewildered Marcus Garvey stormed out of NAACP headquarters in 1917, muttering that it was a white organization&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yefl2u4" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yefl2u4</a></p>
<p>Academia, intelligentsia, the government and the media have been co-opted by anti-White lefties, those referred to by Professor MacDonald as a highly-organized &#8216;hostile elite&rsquo;; they are not black.  Blacks are a battering ram used by the lefties in their larger war against Whites and Western Civilization.</p>
<p>The government has its boot on our White necks.  </p>
<p>Any complaints or even pointing out injustices done to Whites (such as black preferences in admissions to universities) puts one at grave risk of losing his job, and reputation and he may well find himself in the near future charged with committing a felony as in Europe or Canada, facing hard prison time.</p>
<p>Whites are maligned, debased, mocked in the popular media, portrayed as buffoons and losers, our children&rsquo;s textbooks tell them they and their ancestors are evil oppressors responsible for black poverty and pathologies. </p>
<p>The Justice Department will not come to our defense and dismisses our complaints when we are openly intimidated at a polling venue by blacks with nightsticks proclaiming &#8220;You are about to be ruled by the black man, cracker!&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/yewlxtm  </p>
<p>We are not allowed to organize into ethno-centric advocacy groups to promote for our people and the government has made it extremely difficult for us to seek redress for injustices committed against us in court (ask the New Haven Firefighters, those whom sotomeyer voted against), as is allowed by every other ethnic group. </p>
<p>Or, as Edmund Connelly succinctly writes in &#8220;Take the Money and Run&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A prank at a Wal-Mart asking black shoppers to leave sends the mass media into moral panic mode and the police are fast to react. Yet Blacks murdering Whites is not news. Thugs close down a perfectly legal conference by the White Nationalist group American Renaissance by making death threats against hotel workers, and the police, the FBI and the mainstream media are uninterested&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/ycl97ar</p>
<p>For 45 years, a left-dominated, government-controlled, educational-industrial complex has taught our children that the best course of action for us Whites is to hand over our land and wealth, the country we founded, our jobs, and neighborhoods, our entire economy to non-Whites  &mdash;   to those who do not &#8216;look like us&rsquo;  &mdash;    do it willingly, without complaint, and then disappear.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen any of this or don&rsquo;t believe any of it, you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention.</p>
<p>For an excellent summation here is a link to a superb article entitled, &#8220;What&rsquo;s Wrong with White Men:  In Search of an Explanation:&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/lrebsg</p>
<p>And it was not blacks who have done this to us.</p>

An anecdote, not strictly related to the article, but which nevertheless does concern the Africanization of edjamacation: </p>
<p><br>
I was in my local supermarket this eve, and overheard a couple of white 20-ish stockboys chatting as they stocked the shelves. &#8220;I think my favorite course in high school was American History in 11th Grade,&#8221; said one. <br>
 <br>
My ears pricked up at this. Could it really be that, at this late date, a respectful and inspiring account of our dazzling forefathers was still being taught in our modern madrasas? <br>
 <br>
&#8220;Oh yeah?&#8221; said the second stockboy, with perhaps a hint of skepticism in his voice, &#8220;American History, huh?&#8221; <br>
 <br>
&#8220;Yeah, it was really great,&#8221; confirmed the first boy. &#8220;I did a presentation on Rosa Parks.&#8221; </p>

		<p>#13, DLYoung&hellip;.You are absolutely correct about Whites being &#8216;conned&rsquo; (I call it intimidated) by blacks to get what they want, when they want it and how they want it.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why Whites would allow themselves to be a tool for another race, another culture, another mindset&hellip;.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why the Whites would hand their destiny into the hands of the few and think for one second that they will be treated as fairly as they have treated the blacks.</p>
<p>Its confusing to see it when throughout history it has been shown that blacks cant even pay a basic phone bill and expect them to run a country such as America.</p>
<p>The ignorance is astounding!</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Well, there you have it, and I strongly agree!   If the &#8220;proof of the pudding&#8221; is in the results, then blacks have been scoring win after win, regardless of what is shown on bell charts and graphs about IQ&rsquo;s. (That&rsquo;s one reason why I don&rsquo;t like seeing so much unseemly boasting about IQ&rsquo;s here.)  </p>
<p>Blacks are surviving and thriving, while we are footing the bill!  Meanwhile, we are declining and doing nothing about it. Incredible as it seems, our so-called &#8220;leaders&#8221; are even applauding our declining numbers and approaching demise!</p>
<p>There are infinite survival strategies in nature   &mdash;   intelligence being only one of them;  but intelligence won&rsquo;t get you everywhere.  When you look at the bottom line, it&rsquo;s only results that count. They&rsquo;ve been getting the results! We haven&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no denying that. Of course, it has to be said once again, that they have achieved those results with the constant aiding and abetting of well-meaning racial traitors in our midst  (as well as deliberate enemies)&hellip; but that ultimately doesn&rsquo;t matter either. No matter how they got them, they STILL have the results. </p>
<p>Ownership of this country, this continent, is passing, beneath our very eyes, from one race to another. The same thing is happening in Europe, and elsewhere too. It is a momentous historical event that receives very little attention (except here on Amren). When it&rsquo;s mentioned in the media or the public forum it can only be discussed in glowing terms of praise, of how wonderful this is for everyone. Generally, in America, it is not considered &#8220;polite&#8221; to talk about it at all, and in in some other places it&rsquo;s not even legal. That is evidence enough of how far we&rsquo;ve gone.  And some here brag about our intelligence?!!! Where is the evidence of it?</p>

		<p>Advantage to our university system instituting a new white curriculum of &#8220;End of Us Studies&#8221;? </p>
<p>Always more and more class space. </p>
<p>About the time Black Studies began at Berkeley, I took one of the first of such classes at Fresno State College, now University, which I assumed would be similar to every other class I had attended, where students could raise their hands and actually question the instruction, which I soon found out was not the case. </p>
<p>The lack of an IQ advantage should not surprise anyone too much, since it is probably the norm that advanced civilizations fall to forces that are less intelligent, the replacing populations probably possessing other advantages, such as cunning aggressiveness, racial solidarity and prolificness. The good news is that as we are being swept away, we will be writing excellent poetry and will have just figured out the exact chemical composition of Saturn&rsquo;s rings.<br>

		<p>There is absolutely NO SUCH THING as &#8220;black studies.&#8221;  In black studies courses, they ALWAYS talk about how blacks interact with other races, and never talk about only blacks.  In other words, it could correctly be named &#8220;black and white studies, from the point of view of blacks.&#8221;</p>

		<p>A huge difference in &#8220;earning&#8221; and being &#8220;gifted/given&#8221;  exists in reality.</p>
<p>AA is all about &#8220;gifting&#8221; rather than &#8220;earning&#8221;.  Without some sort of government employment black unemployment would be over 60%.  Black unemployment now stands at over 25%, do the math, and it requires little science to validate.</p>
<p>The white people of this nation have been lied too, conned, and extorted, and now the resources are gone, the monies wasted, and hard times await.  Nothing but hard times.</p>
<p>Get ready the reaper is approaching.</p>

		<p>From my perspective, it seems like the Black community in America are really making a big, big deal, about African American studies. I guess that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why someone like Professor Gates, a friend of Obama,s got to become a tenured university professor, through affirmative action.</p>
<p>But I think that if I were Black, I&rsquo;d be interested not only in learning about the Black experience in America, but about the Blacks people of Africa, and their cultures, history, and so forth. To learn about the distant sources, of African American culture.</p>
<p>Why? Because aside from slavery, and the Civil rights movement, and things such as hip-hop and the carreers of basketball stars, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be that much to discuss, in African American history, I&rsquo;m afraid. </p>
