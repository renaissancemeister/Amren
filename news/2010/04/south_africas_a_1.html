<h1><a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE6342FK20100405">South Africa&rsquo;s AWB Rules Out Revenge for Leader&rsquo;s Death</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Mkhize, Reuters, April 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The party of murdered South African white supremacist Eugene Terre&rsquo;blanche promised on Monday not to seek violent revenge, easing fears that his death might provoke racial unrest.</p>
<p>Terre&rsquo;blanche, who led the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) that pushed to preserve apartheid in the 1990s, was hacked and battered to death on Saturday following a suspected dispute over pay with two black farm workers.</p>
<p>Leaders of his party, which has been marginalized in recent years, initially vowed to avenge his death, blaming it on sentiment whipped up by the leader of the youth league of the ruling African National Congress.</p>
<p>But an AWB spokesman told reporters that the party was not planning any violent action.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AWB is not going to engage in any form of violent retaliation to avenge Mr Terre&rsquo;blanche&rsquo;s death,&#8221; said Pieter Steyn, a general in the AWB. &#8220;We appeal for people to remain calm. Anyone engaging in any form of violence is not doing it as AWB.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents of the ANC accuse its youth leader Julius Malema of stoking racial tension through rhetoric and his singing of an apartheid-era song containing the words &#8220;Kill the Boer&#8221;  &mdash;  now banned by the courts as hate speech.</p>
<p>Malema was in Zimbabwe over the weekend, where he praised President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s seizures of land from white farmers to give to landless blacks, a policy which critics say has helped to ruin Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Malema told reporters in Zimbabwe that the song was not a factor in Terre&rsquo;blanche&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ANC also condemned the linking of the song to Terre&rsquo;blanche&rsquo;s death. &#8220;Any claim that blacks intend to harm other race groups .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is baseless and devoid of all truth,&#8221; the party said in a statement.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s rand largely shrugged off news of Terre&rsquo;blanche&rsquo;s killing, and one analyst said other financial markets would probably follow suit.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a smart move to change over from violence to &#8220;we want a separate land for whites and if you disagree then YOU&rsquo;RE the racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get more support than if they ran around talking about gunning down blacks across SA.  That sort of thing would only appeal to whites if blacks were waging a campaign of ethnic genocide(and before anyone says they already are, I mean an OBVIOUS in your face one) against them.</p>

		<p>Here you have an excellent gauge of the capacity for logical reasoning amongst these people:</p>
<p>1. The youth leader of the ANC sings &ldquo;Kill the Boer&rdquo;.<br/>
2. The ANC then states: &ldquo;Any claim that blacks intend to harm other race groups &hellip; is baseless and devoid of all truth,&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much the argument of a child who has been caught red-handed stealing sweets.</p>
<p>How can they possibly claim, with a straight face, that it is &#8216;baseless&rsquo;? This would be comical if the ramifications weren&rsquo;t so serious.</p>

		<p>looks like the Communist&rsquo;s of the ANC got to the AWB and most likly threatened death.  I hope the Whites of South Africa don&rsquo;t simply go back into slumber mode.</p>

<p><i>The ANC also condemned the linking of the song to Terre&rsquo;blanche&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;Any claim that blacks intend to harm other race groups &hellip; is baseless and devoid of all truth,&rdquo; the party said in a statement.</i></p>
<p><br/>
What does the ANC call 3000 white farmers slaughtered by blacks   &mdash;   Terre&rsquo;Blanche is only the latest in a sickeningly long line   &mdash;   over the past decade? This has all been on the ANC&rsquo;s watch. So not only is there reason to believe &ldquo;that blacks intend to harm other race groups,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s also reason to believe that it&rsquo;s been done with at least tacit approval <i>from the ANC itself</i>. </p>
<p>So if the African Nationalist Communists aren&rsquo;t actively promoting the Boer genocide, they sure aren&rsquo;t doing a hell of a lot to prevent it. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to see the anti-white prejudice and outright Big Lie of  journalists who invariably label Terreblanche&rsquo;s support of white separatism as white supremacy. How can someone want &#8220;supremacy&#8221; over Blacks when they don&rsquo;t even want to associate with them? I&rsquo;m sure Terreblanche would have been happy to just have one of so-called desolate homelands offered to Blacks during apartheid than the status quo served up by the traitorous de Kerk people. The Whites would create an oasis of the homeland.</p>

<p>May I remind you that Terreblanche had two black workers, and that one of those workers was a 15 year old minor. South Africa has many poor and homeless whites, whom Terreblanche could have employed, instead of the blacks.</p>
<p>The murder of Terreblanche by his two black workers was wrong, and the murderers should be severely punished. But he was inconsistent in preaching his white separatist doctrine. He constantly preached to white farmers to free themselves from their dependence on black labor, in order to prepare themselves to be self-reliant in a white homeland. But he did not live according to his teachings.<br/>
