			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bonnie Malkin, London Telegraph, April 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister, has ordered one of the most controversial detention centres in the country be reopened in an attempt to deal with the rising number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia.</p>
<p>The Curtin detention centre in Western Australia, which has been described as a &#8220;gulag&#8221;, will be renovated and reopened to house Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum seekers who applications for Australian visas have been suspended.</p>
<p>The move by Mr Rudd, who has come under pressure to deal with a growing number of boat arrivals from Indonesia, has been strongly condemned by human rights groups.</p>
<p>Even Phillip Ruddock, who worked as immigration minister during the Howard government, said Curtin was the most remote and &#8220;primitive&#8221; facility used during the previous administration.</p>
<p>Richard Harding, Western Australia&rsquo;s former inspector of custodial services, said the centre was like a &#8220;gulag&#8221; that should not be reopened.</p>
<p>Curtin was closed down in 2002 after one third of its 340 detainees were involved in riots, hunger strikes and self-harm.</p>
<p>The move comes as detention facilities on Christmas Island, a remote Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, reached breaking point. More than 1,800 asylum seekers have arrived on the Christmas Island in the past three months and the issue is becoming increasingly sensitive in the run up to elections, which must be called before December.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd is keen to appear to be toughening up his stance on asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Chris Evans, the immigration minister, said the Curtin centre would hold 200 to 300 single males. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s important to understand we&rsquo;re already seeing an increase in refusal rates for asylum-seekers from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People-smugglers are not able to assure people they will get a visa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Mr Evans announced that all asylum claims from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka would be suspended for at least three months while the situation in both countries was reassessed.<br>

		<p>$18.000 PC typo in Australia</p>
<p>In a culinary book for the recipe &ldquo;Bible pasta&rdquo;  &mdash;  tagliatelle paste with sardines and prosciutto instead &ldquo;add some salt and fresh ground black pepper&rdquo; was printed &ldquo;add some salt and fresh ground black people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. Bob Session, the head of the Penguin Group Australia publisher house, stated, that he doesn&rsquo;t understand why is it there so much ado about a stupid typo missed by a proofreader. It was a single typo in 150 recipes, but due to the noise raised by Aussie&rsquo;s liberals the house had to print 7000 additional correct copies at the cost of $18.000.<br>

		<p>You would have thought a country with an ocean between itself and the world wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem controlling illegal entry. It&rsquo;s not like the US which has a long land Southern border which can be crossed nearly all along its entire length.</p>

		<p>I have always admired the way Australia handles their unwanted asylum seekers. I think that they should be held until their identities and stories can be verified by authorities. This is so much better than the catch and release tactic that has been used by US immigration. Australia,like any other country has the right to admit those that it wants to admit and should not be forced to accept those who do not have the language and job skills needed to excel in modern Australia.</p>

<p>NO comparison between a detention center in Aussie land and the GULAG.</p>
<p>A ten year sentence in the GULAG was the same as a death sentence. Almost NO ONE could survive more than eight years in the GULAG.</p>

<p>I would admire them much more if they would bring back the White Australia policy. Only White people should be admitted in and most of the brown and black masses within Australia should be sent back to where they came from.</p>

		<p>At 22 million we have a pretty small population. Theres enough asylum seekers in the world to fill this country at least 5 times over. Rather than house, clothe and possibly give them citizenship we should send them back. If we accept them they will never stop coming, and allowing them in isn&rsquo;t fixing the problems which cause them to come anyway</p>

		<p>At 22 million people Australia will soon be overwhelmed by asylum seekers.But what about legal and illegal immigrants. They are the real danger.That train can&rsquo;t be stopped. China has cast it&rsquo;s gluttonous eyes on Australia.Aussie buisness men (traitors) are already feeding on the fast buck mentality. They are beholden to the Chinese for their Golman-like profits.They and the Rudd ilk will sell out their country. One for profit; the other on the altar of political correctness.Nobody discriminates like the Han do.Aussies will soon find that out. I give them 30 years-no more.</p>

		<p>These Sri Lankans and Afghans are not wanted and not needed.<br>
It really is as simple and direct as that.<br>
I just wish an Australian politician, or any western politician for that matter, just had the guts to openly explicitly say this to thse &#8216;asylum&rsquo; racketeers (for that&rsquo;s precisely what they are), rather than beat around the bush with mealy-mouthed platitudes.<br>
 Honesty, in the long run, is the best course in politics and elsewhere in life.But, remember folks all politicians are merely professional liars.</p>

<p>  You are right Everyman. The Gulag campus Vorkuta, Kolyma, Karaganda, etc. were &#8220;death through labor&#8221; camps. No one was expected to live out their sentences. The few who survived either worked in the hospitals or as criminal (Urka) trustees. The controlled media&rsquo;s comparison of the Australian detention centers to these horrific Gulag camps is almost obscene.</p>

<p>As much as I dislike the muslims, I do admire their countries way of dealing with illegal aliens. Prison, then deportation and promise of death to be caught illegal again!!</p>

		<p>Sri Lankans in this article here means Tamil Hindu Sri Lankans, not the Burghers [mixed-race Sri Lankans, to most of whom Australia is now home] or the Christians, who are well-educated and decent citizens and who prosper in places like Negombo.</p>
<p>Tamil Sri Lankans are good people on the whole, smart and industrious, BUT they bring all the hatreds and neuroses of the Ethnic Civil War with them. More f  &mdash;  -ing Balts and anti-Commie Vietnamese!</p>
<p>A few hundred Sri Lankan Tamils every year would be quite enough for Australia to absorb.</p>
<p>As for Afghans and Muslim Iraqis, zero every year would be more than sufficient.</p>
<p>Australia ought to welcome the Christians from Iraq and make sure all other Iraqis are firmly excluded.</p>
