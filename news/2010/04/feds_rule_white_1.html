<h1><a href="/news/2005/08/feds_rule_white.html">Feds Rule &#8220;White Pride&#8221; Is &#8220;Offensive&#8221; and &#8220;Immoral&#8221;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Justin J. Moritz, AR News, August 2, 2005</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you are looking for more evidence that the United States government is biased against white people, you can add their decision in my trademark case. In February, 2004, I applied for a trademark on the words &#8220;White Pride Country Wide.&#8221; I did it as an exercise against political correctness. I intentionally did not choose &#8220;white power,&#8221; &#8220;white supremacy,&#8221; or &#8220;the white race&#8221; because of the negative connotations of those terms. Trademarks can be denied to offensive phrases.</p>
<p>When I later searched United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) records, I found that &#8220;Black Power,&#8221; &#8220;Black Supremacy,&#8221; and &#8220;La Raza&#8221; (Spanish for &#8220;The Race&#8221;) had all been approved by the USPTO and been found not to be offensive. The USPTO had also approved and registered &#8220;The Black Panther Party&#8221; and &#8220;Burn, Baby, Burn,&#8221; the party&rsquo;s slogan. The Black Panthers had assassinated white police officers but neither term was found to be offensive or immoral. To me, &#8220;white pride&#8221; was a non-offensive, positive term, or at least I thought so.</p>
<p>On December 23, 2004, I received my Christmas present from the USPTO. In an Office Action prepared by Barbara Rutland, it denied my trademark, ruling that the &#8220;white pride&#8221; part of my request was &#8220;offensive,&#8221; &#8220;immoral,&#8221; and &#8220;scandalous.&#8221; Here are her very words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Section 2(a) Refusal</p>
<p>&#8220;Registration is refused because the proposed mark consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter. Trademark Act Section 2(a) U.S.C. 1052(a); TMEP 1203.01. According to the attached evidence from a Lexis/Nexis database and a search of the Internet using the search engine www.google.com, the &#8220;WHITE PRIDE&#8221; element of the proposed mark is considered offensive and therefore scandalous.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>My Appeal</b></p>
<p>On January 1, 2005, I decided to appeal the USPTO decision, but not before doing some research. I found that that the following &#8220;pride&#8221; terms have all been registered as trademarks by the U.S Government:</p>
<p>&#8220;African Pride,&#8221; &#8220;African Man Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Asian Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Bahama Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Black Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Brazilian Pride,&#8221; &#8220;China-Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Chippewa Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Choctaw Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Colombian Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Cuban Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Dakota Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Dominican Pride,&#8221; &#8220;El Salvador Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Ecuador Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Gay Pride Apparel,&#8221; &#8220;Guyanese Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Havana Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Honduran Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Indian Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Jamaica&rsquo;s Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Jewish Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Kwanzaa Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Long Beach Lesbian and Gay Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Mayan Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Mexican Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Native Pride!,&#8221; &#8220;Nicaraguan Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Orgullo Hispano&#8221; (Hispanic Pride), &#8220;Orgoglio&#8221; (Hispanic  &mdash;  &#8220;Great Pride&#8221; (supremacy?)), &#8220;Qisqueya Pride&#8221; (Dominican Republic Pride), &#8220;Rainbow Pride Coach,&#8221; &#8220;Red Pride,&#8221; &#8220;San Diego Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride,&#8221; &#8220;Spanish Pride,&#8221; and &#8220;West Indian Pride.&#8221;</p>
<p>The factual evidence for my appeal was overwhelming, or at least I thought so. It seemed as though the federal government wanted everybody to have pride, except white people. It seemed to be a clear case of discrimination.</p>
<p><b>USPTO denies appeal</b></p>
<p>In February 2005, the USPTO issued their &#8220;FINAL OFFICE ACTION.&#8221; It was again prepared by Barbara Rutland. The USPTO upheld its original denial, explaining:</p>
<p>&#8221;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. prior decisions and actions of other trademark examining attorneys in registering different marks are <em>without evidentiary value</em> [emphasis added] and are not binding upon the Office.&#8221;</p>
<p>In plain English, the USPTO was saying that their own records cannot be used against it. Imagine a taxpayer being audited by the IRS. Could he sit back and say, &#8220;Go ahead, audit me, but you can&rsquo;t use my records against me&#8221;?</p>
<p>I lost my $1,300 non-refundable trademark application fee.</p>
<p><b>ACLU denies assistance and adds insult</b></p>
<p>My next step was to seek outside help from the Minnesota branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). I sent a brief letter to the ACLU-MN summarizing my case and asking if they were interested. They initially said they were willing to review the case, so I sent them pages of documentation. I thought I might have a chance, since the ACLU prides itself on defending the rights of the little guy. I am white, male, heterosexual, married, employed, native born, English speaking, Christian-valued, have no criminal record, and am a retired law enforcement officer. I could be the perfect &#8220;token&#8221; case outside their mainstream clientele, or at least I thought so.</p>
<p>In March 2005, the ACLU not only turned my case down but took the opportunity to slam white people and Christians. Renee Hamilton, legal assistant for the ACLU-MN, wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus, when the PTO examined Moritz&rsquo;s mark, their rejection of his mark was reasonable given that such a slogan has just but one meaning i.e. superiority of what he term [sic] &#8216;the white race&rsquo; over all other races and their brand of Christianity over the other religions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ACLU was fully aware of all the other &#8220;pride&#8221; trademarks I had listed in my documents. If a &#8220;pride&#8221; trademark had been turned down for any group of people, other than whites, the ACLU would be in court screaming &#8220;Discrimination by the United States Government!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Center for Individual Rights (CIR) provides assistance</b></p>
<p>My next step was to seek help from the Center for Individual Rights. They are the conservative response to the ACLU. They are political opposites but much smaller than the ACLU. I corresponded with the CIR through mail, email, and telephone conversations. In June 2005, the CIR politely and professionally declined my request for help, but because of monetary, not ideological considerations.</p>
<p>The CIR did help by putting my case on the Federalist website, a conservative site where attorneys can take pro bono cases. As of August 2005, I had not received any responses.</p>
<p>You can help</p>
<p>The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right of the people to &#8220;petition the government for a redress of grievances.&#8221; If you disagree with the decision of the USPTO in my case, please petition the government.</p>

		<p>So the other terms like Black Pride are not ones i can put on a t-shirt without permission from the trademark holder, but anyone in the world is allowed to put the term White Pride on a tshirt without asking anyone?</p>
<p>If this were publicised it could make it appear that the government wants to silence the other terms but wants to increase the use of the term &#8220;White Pride&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone should sue using that argument.</p>

		<p>I remember some 10 yrs. ago when the United Daughters of the Confederacy was denied its request for the renewal of its trademark because black Illinois Representative, Carol Mosely Braun, was offended by the Confederate flag on its logo.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not news to me that this agency of the federal government&rsquo;s is hostile to whites.  But its unfriendly bias is  certainly made more conspicuous by its approval of all these other &#8220;Pride&#8221; groups.  </p>

		<p>Sometimes, I think white patriots and preservationists should come up with explicitly ambiguous means of telling &ldquo;inside jokes&rdquo; and thus communicating with each other on the streets, via tee shirts and bumper stickers. Things that have no meaning to outsiders, but a lot to us, such as:</p>
<p>1.) &lsquo;Black Panthers are better than Albino RINOS, particularly at &ldquo;Tea Parties&rdquo; on the River Styx;&rsquo; </p>
<p>2.) &lsquo;Sometimes you can be too white, especially if you showered in color-safe bleach;&rsquo;</p>
<p>3.) &lsquo;White Privileges are a social construct, unless you work in a &ldquo;non profit&rdquo; entity;&rsquo;</p>
<p>4.) &lsquo;The brightest color in the rainbow is always Red, unless you prefer your tacos pink;&rsquo;</p>
<p>5.) And of course, &lsquo;A  religion of peace is better than Western Civilization in pieces of your ham on Easter, or your beer at Oktoberfest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Things like this might just fly under stealth through the multicultural radar, unlike the more blatant expressions of self-identity for whites, such as: &ldquo;White Pride Country Wide.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is what we have come to in 2010; as always, God help us all,</p>

		<p>I guess the members of other races must think they are inferior so the federal government makes sure whites don&rsquo;t remind them. It would be interesting if someone made up a slogan like &#8220;White pride the root of all problems world wide&#8221;,I think the federal hate and thought police would have no problem putting the stamp of approval on that. Remember the quote &#8220;white mans greed keeps the world in need&#8221;,? I forget,who said that?</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious, that long list of &#8220;pride&#8221; designations, but only &#8220;white pride&#8221; is &ldquo;offensive,&rdquo; &ldquo;immoral,&rdquo; or &ldquo;scandalous!&rdquo; Obviously, the term &#8220;white pride&#8221; is &#8220;scandalous&#8221; only because the MSM has, over the past 40 years, hyped it up as being such. In other words, brainwashing.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get past the first few paragraphs my anger was growing so much.</p>
<p>This thing erroneously called a nation isn&rsquo;t worth saving in its present form.  In fact it isn&rsquo;t even a nation.  It&rsquo;s a tiered empire, with whites at the bottom.</p>
<p>The country has been reshaped by corporate crooks whose only allegiance is to money, and by power mad, ego absorbed politicians whose only allegiance is getting re-elected as many times as possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to call it quits and start over.</p>

		<p>How stupid we as white people are as we sit idly by and watch Liberals, people of color, illegal immigrants and others shape our goverment policies that stack the deck against us. White people built this country and we are letting all these groups pull it out from under us. We deserve every thing they do to us. I recently found some information on Zimbabwe and South Africa where robbing, raping and killing white people are almost sport. White people built those countries as well. South Africa was once one of the more prosperous places on the planet. Now white people are pushed aside at every turn in society and are paying with their lives. They can&rsquo;t move out fast enough. If it happened there it will happen here. Slowly but surely they whittle away under the banner of diversity. Let&rsquo;s be honest, diversity is a sham and every culture that attempted it doomed itself.</p>

		<p>Interesting how only racial and ethnic groups with few if any achievements to their credit are encouraged to have &#8220;pride&#8221; in their race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>In truth, there is only one real source of pride, and that is pride in accomplishment and cultural achievement.  Racial and ethnic groups with neither accomplishment or culture have no source of pride.</p>
<p>Most of us remember the rather pathetic and sad attempts of blacks in this country to gain some measure of pride in themselves merely by noting that they were black (I&rsquo;m black and and I&rsquo;m proud!) and that merely repeating this statement would engender legitimate pride among among them. </p>
<p>This lame effort petered out of its own accord, perhaps leaving its own proponents with some measure of lame embarrassment.</p>

<p>OK then, if we&rsquo;re not allowed to trademark the words &ldquo;White Pride Country Wide,&rdquo; how about a white version of the old 1960s/70s rallying cry for Black Power movement (and James Brown song), &#8220;Say it loud! I&rsquo;m black and I&rsquo;m proud!&#8221; </p>
<p>The white version would be: </p>
<p>&#8220;Say it loud! I&rsquo;m white and I&rsquo;m not unduly ashamed of this particular piece of information!&#8221; </p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s EXACTLY why they need it.  They are desperately in need of SOMETHING to be proud of.  So they&rsquo;re proud of being black. Proud of having &#8220;soul&#8221; [whatever that is].  Proud that &#8220;Black is beautiful&#8221;, etc.   When that&rsquo;s all you have, you have to make the best of it.  </p>
<p>Forget about achievements.  (Well, maybe they invented the doorknob or something.)<br>

		<p>This article was written in 2005, does anyone know if the case were ever taken up by the CIR or anyone else?</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s imperative to donate to causes such as the CIR  &mdash;  the ACLU has endless monies to fight Whites on all fronts, as they do and the SPLC uses scare tactic to get its donors into coughing up huge amounts of money by telling them THEY (the SPLC) are the only thing protecting non-Whites from White Supremacists hell-bent on forming a Nazi Fourth Reich.  It would be laughable it if didn&rsquo;t work so well, as, after all the SPLC is a money-making organization, not a civil-rights organization.</p>
<p>As it is, we have no White organizations that will promote for our people and are sitting ducks for every anti-White, non-White racist organization.</p>
<p>White Raven writes:</p>

<p>Well Stated.</p>
<p>And the sooner every White wakes up and realizes this, the better.  Tell everyone you know, educate your children  &mdash;  there will be resistance as first (I&rsquo;ve been called a &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; by a member of my own family, even though we lost one of our few, precious family members in WW II, shot down by Nazis in the bomber he was piloting, his body washed up on a beach in Portugal).</p>
<p>This nation is indeed not worth fighting for in its present form, as it openly discriminates against Whites, especially White males. </p>
<p>We have decided that NO White male in our family will be sent home in a body bag &#8216;protecting&rsquo; and &#8216;defending&rsquo; the current anti-White regime.  Let them fight their own **** Third World wars.</p>
<p>Do Not Allow Your White Sons To Become Cannon Fodder, as that seems the only thing the government believes your precious White child is worth.</p>

		<p>John,</p>
<p>On my campus, several of us have taken to the substitution word &#8220;Canadians&#8221; for the ethnic groups that cause problems to get around the university speech codes. </p>
<p><br>
No one cares when you slam Canadians, but if you comment on the hoodie wearing, black youths that threaten people as they enter, and leave the part of the campus shared with the local high school you can end up in front of an expulsion tribunal. </p>
<p>Much like the cameras that log the license plates of every vehicle which passes (at nearly every major intersection in my city), and the draconian no-fly list, and passport revocation lists   &mdash;   these are things I never expected to see in my country. I expected them out of some tin-pot communist dictatorship, but not here. </p>
<p>The worst thing we can do is remain silent. Silence is a form of passive consent. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Say it RIGHT  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m proud that I&rsquo;m white&#8221;.<br>
A number of years ago, blacks had tee-shirts made up with the slogan &#8220;black by popular demand&#8221;.  There was a protest by blacks when some whites sported tee-shirts with the slogan &#8220;Thank God I&rsquo;m White&#8221;.  Double standard anyone??<br>
If (and when) I am called &#8220;racist&#8221; by those who do not agree with me, I tell the accusers &#8220;thank you&#8221;.  This defuses ANY argument and puts them on the defensive.  If more whites did this instead of cowering in misplaced &#8220;guilt&#8221;, we could make those who call us racist ineffective in their arguments.  <br>
I wear my so-called &#8220;racist&#8221; label as a badge of honor.<br>
A bit of history on the word &#8220;racist&#8221;.  The words &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; were coined by (leftist) &#8220;social scientists&#8221; in the 1920&rsquo;s in order to further their aim of promoting and advocating communism by breaking down (and criminalizing) basic human (white) social behavior.  It seems that they have been somewhat successful by demonizing ANY whites who attempt to show racial pride and solidarity.   The advantage we whites have is superior intellect, grasp of logical principles and the WILL TO push back against the purveyors of evil (communism).  </p>

		<p>How about &#8220;White By Default?&#8221;  Maybe that doesn&rsquo;t really work right, but something about it appeals to the idea that no one white can say they are white.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Say it loud! I&rsquo;m white and I&rsquo;m not unduly ashamed of this particular piece of information!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ya know what?  I LOVE it!!  Without coming right out and saying it, it says, &#8220;We&rsquo;re the smart race, and the race with a sense of humor!&#8221;  I think it ought to be on T-shirts, bumper stickers, etc.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;black by popular demand&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s much too clever to have been created by an African. Some profit seeking White guy must have come up with that. He probably sold lots of tee shirts.</p>

		<p>The very first domestic enemies we must purge from this society are the members of the politically correct cabal.  </p>
<p>This unprecedented insidious communist social censorship has no place in our free society.  </p>
<p>This is government control over free speech by intimidation.</p>
<p>This is an all-out assault to silence the truth about the genetic inferiority of some minorities.  </p>
<p>We must no longer tolerate whites being fearful of losing their jobs because they were supposedly overheard to say something unflattering about minorities.  </p>
<p>Every day minorities get whites fired by lying to their bosses about an alleged racist statement made by a white they don&rsquo;t like.  </p>
<p>Communism is all about empowering a nation&rsquo;s lower-class to go after the middle-class and help the party leadership destroy it.  </p>
<p>This puts the future of whites in the hands of racist blacks and this is unacceptable&hellip;</p>

		<p>We need 21st century Jeffersons, Washingtons, Madisons, etc to step up and re-birth a white nation somewhere within the states, according to the original founders dreams and philosophy.  As much as I am a die-hard Southerner and Confederate, I would happily relocate to a new, all white nation anywhere in the current states.  Liberal whites, blacks, and all other minorities desire to see us sitting upon a stool of eternal repentence, and will not stop until we are erradicated as a race.  If somehow this can all come about, let us not allow those rascal liberal whites who helped borne this upon us to come to our new white utopia, once they themselves are being victimized by the very animals they worship through diversity, amen.</p>

		<p>A century of communist infiltration and sedition has finally come to fruition in America and they believe they have won.  </p>
<p>We know who they are and we are obligated to eradicate every last one of them.  </p>
<p>Once you send your first few communists to whatever hell they go to you will feel much better about yourself.</p>
<p>Trust me on this one&hellip;</p>
