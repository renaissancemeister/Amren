<h1>NY Senator: &#8216;You Racist People in Here&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marcia Kramer, WCBS-TV (New York), April 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brooklyn State Senator Kevin Parker is a well-documented hothead, and on Wednesday he took to the airwaves to unapologetically defend his latest shouting match.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s par for the course for what we have to do in Albany  &mdash;  fighting the forces of evil,&#8221; Senator Parker said.</p>
<p>Parker shockingly identified the &#8220;enemies&#8221; he&rsquo;s fighting as other senators.</p>
<p>&#8220;These long-term, white supremacist, you know, Republican senators,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That followed a free-for-all shouting match in Albany Tuesday where Parker heatedly objected to the questions asked by a white senator, John DeFrancisco of Syracuse, of a black nominee to the New York State Power Authority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re out of order  &mdash;  why don&rsquo;t you step outside,&#8221; he [Committee Chair Carl Kruger] told Parker. &#8220;You&rsquo;re disrespecting me as chairman. One more outburst like that and I&rsquo;ll ask you to be removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parker didn&rsquo;t like that one bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, then get somebody to remove me. Bring people though,&#8221; Parker said.</p>
<p>There have been other temper tantrums involving the senator. Last year he was accused of felony assault after doing $1,000 in damage to the car of New York Post photographer William Lopez and smashing his camera after he snapped Parker&rsquo;s picture.</p>
<p>Two years ago, an aide filed charges against Parker, claiming he pushed her during an argument and smashed her glasses. In 2005, Parker was accused of punching a traffic agent in the face. The charges were dropped after parker agreed to take anger management classes.</p>
<p>Senator Parker is due in court next month on the assault case. Sources tell CBS 2 his attorney is trying to cut a no-jail deal, but the district attorney isn&rsquo;t buying it.</p>

		<p>What this dimwitted fool rages about can be found on television every night by some black talking head or another.  Considering that MOST every black is of the Jeremiah Wright frame of mind, it isn&rsquo;t surprising.</p>
<p>Since Obama has come to power, however, black anti-white haters seem to have become emboldened even more than usual.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure they do so, because they assume that &#8220;blacks are in control now.&#8221;  Coupled with their usual stupid arrogance, this is serving as a wake up call by blacks to whites who needed a shock or two to get them moving.  </p>
<p>And those same whites will need some kind of horrendous event to awaken them further to take a more racially aware stance, like a deadly attack by blacks and/or Hispanics against whites&hellip;.or, unfortunately, a series of attacks.</p>
<p>And also &#8220;unfortunately,&#8221; those will be coming.</p>
<p>As many of us expected, the community organizer has created the most racially divisive climate in the history of this country, and he&rsquo;s too arrogant and foolish to back off, so the situation will continue to accelerate until critical mass is eventually reached.</p>

<p>The bar for being a White supremacist must have dropped lower than I ever imagined lately.  I&rsquo;d sure like to know where these &#8220;White supremacist&#8221; Republicans are, so I can send their campaign funds a few bucks.</p>
<p>Apparently the left has sensed that &#8220;racist&#8221; has lost a bit of its power lately.  &#8220;White supremacist&#8221; seems to be the latest attempt to resuscitate the glory days when a marxist could shut his opponent up just by uttering the word &#8220;racist.&#8221;<br>

		<p>It is because of comments like this-and these comments are now being made every week by black elites-that has completely changed my mind about the Civil War. The Civil War wasn&rsquo;t worth death of 750 thousand young White men and the two million maimed for life.</p>
<p>If post-1965 nonwhites become a majority in the military and in police departments around the country, NATIVE BORN WHITE MALES will experience violent persecution&hellip;.even the stupid and traitorous White Liberals will be persecuted.</p>

		<p>He reminds me of a black First Sergeant in Korea in 1976 who, while at the NCO Club drinking, suddenly surged to the stage where a young Korean lady was singing to entertain the troops and grabbed the mike from her and started spouting the most vile things directed to all whites there. His rant went on for longer than it should have until two burly Sergeants Major pulled him off the stage and escorted him back to his unit.  About three days later he was at Oakland, CA being retired against his will. The Army was not too politically correct then.  It would appear no matter the job or education lurking within is hatred for whites.</p>

		<p> Anger management classes? I&rsquo;ll go further than that: Sen. Parker is mentally disturbed and needs a psychiatrist, some heavy meds and possibly a straightjacket.</p>
<p> I knew a black woman with issues like his who lived in my home town. She fretted, fantasized and brooded so much about &#8220;White racism&#8221; that she is now mentally ill, has had to be hospitalized for long periods, and looks like a walking corpse. The voters of Sen. Parker&rsquo;s district had better wise up, and throw him out, before he does something that can&rsquo;t be plea-bargained or explained away. </p>

<p>I work with the U.S. military here in Afghan and in Iraq and you can BELIEVE THIS! your described nonwhite majority in the military EXISTS NOW!!! I think there are fewer blacks in the Marines, but the Army is MOST certainly predominantly black or hispanic.</p>

		<p>Those familiar with their behavior know that blacks admire these kinds of outbursts. It&rsquo;s a form of &#8220;keepin&rsquo; it real&#8221; and &#8220;not takin&rsquo; no she-it from da man.&#8221; If the nearest white doesn&rsquo;t immediately step up and break the raging Bantu&rsquo;s jaw, it reinforces their simple-minded notion that any number of whites can be intimidated by an aggressive black.</p>
<p>Then they wonder why no one wants to hire them, do business with them, listen to their opinions, or interact with them in any way unless forced to by law.</p>

		<p>My wife and I are former NYers and we lived in the city when dinkins was mayor, so we were well aware of what was going to happen when/if a black became president. Our relatives were shocked at the way we spoke and went ahead and voted for the black guy. Of course, they won&rsquo;t vote for him the second time.</p>
<p>My wife worked with a very nice Jewish woman during dinkins time and when dinkins came up for reelection, of course, she voted against him. She said it was the first time in her life she ever voted republican.</p>

		<p>If all Republicans were white supremacists, Senator Kevin Parker would likely be living in Liberia or never have been born at all.</p>
<p>Or does he not remember which party freed the slaves against the will of their own President(Lincoln did NOT want to free the slaves, they practically had to force him to sign it)?</p>

		<p>First, go the Council oc Conservative citizens website and watch the video they have about this clown.  I didn&rsquo;t realize that this fool had so many anger management issues-but that&rsquo;s usually par for the course for blacks.  Anyway,  just another fine example of black rule, and how these stupid, dim-witted people will find &#8220;racism&#8221; everywhere.  Kind of like an extreme fundamentalist Christian finding obscenity in the crotch of a tree.</p>

Get enough of them in the legislature and you&rsquo;ll have a Mugabe or Idi Amin-type government right here.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have a law degree, so someone with one please tell me how is this not slander?? The protected species of North American can say anything they want about race, but God forbid a white person speaks about race and intelligence or the education gap&rsquo;s real reason.</p>

		<p>The above poster was right.  Most whites are intimidated by blacks because of their anger, not because of their strength (hell, seen whimpy black guys and muscular whites), but because of being called a racist.  Remember that video where an old white man beat the snot out of some black punk?  If an old white man can do, what excuse do us younger white men have for tolerating bad, aggressive, criminal, and rude behavior from blacks?  It&rsquo;s not their built people are afraid of.  It&rsquo;s being called &#8216;racist&rsquo; that scares people.  Get past the aggressive bravado that blacks exude, and you&rsquo;ll see cowards.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know much on American law myself but am willing to bet it once again comes down to money or the will of people to go to court. I am also willing to bet that these Republican Senators don&rsquo;t want to open the cans of worms that would be opened if they started to sue black leaders for their outbursts. You can be sure that the defense lawyers for Kevin Parker would go out of their way to get as much dirt on Republican Senators as they could and I am one hundred percent sure there is a deep deep hole to be dug. </p>
<p>It may also be damaging to their political campaigns as they would call undue media attention to themselves and ofcourse we all know that speaking out against blacks is obviously racist as blacks are perfect in everyway. </p>
<p>Just remeber that these Senators are probably just as corrupt and power hungry as Kevin Parker, therefore they will never break the silence surrounding black on white violence or black on white intimidation. They only care about themselves and their bank accounts. </p>
<p>It is and always has been up to the American people to enforce their rights, given to you by your constitution. You cannot expect your traitorous senators to do it for you, as that is an exercise in futility. Anyway, I do hope there is maybe another commentator that can give you a more indepth legal answer as I deal in South African law and not American.</p>
<p>Thanks CSA</p>
