<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=140717">Did Tea-Party Smear Incite KC Riot?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Cashill, WorldNetDaily, April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If there was any one individual at the center of the smear of the tea-party protest on March 20 outside the Capitol, it was Kansas City Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. </p>
<p>In the original McClatchy report posted 90 minutes after the incident, &#8220;Tea Party Protesters Scream &#8216;Nigger&rsquo; at Congressman,&#8221; it was Cleaver who uniquely heard the slur and Cleaver who was uniquely spat upon. And so &#8220;Spittlegate&#8221; was born. </p>
<p>McClatchy&rsquo;s Kansas City Star ran with the McClatchy story and spread the poison. The following day its normally sober editorial page columnist ratcheted up the already inflammatory reporting by insisting that &#8220;some tea-party supporter spat on Cleaver Saturday on Capitol Hill because the U.S. congressman is black.&#8221; </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the message metastasized throughout Kansas City&rsquo;s black media, unchecked and unchallenged. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}On successive weekends since the Capitol Hill protest, mobs of black youths have been descending on Kansas City&rsquo;s famed Country Club Plaza, among the most attractive urban shopping and dining venues in the country. </p>
<p>This past Saturday, even the Kansas City Star had to take notice when, according to a Plaza spokesman, some 900 youths roamed the Plaza streets, &#8220;destroying property, pushing people as they walked down the sidewalk and spitting on people.&#8221; </p>
<p>Spitting on people? The Star does not mention whether the people were spit on because they were white or beaten because they were white or robbed because they were white. In fact, in a 2,000-word summary article, the Star does not mention race in any which way at all. </p>
<p>The only way that a visitor from another planet might infer a racial angle from the article was the one-word reference to the &#8220;NAACP,&#8221; which was among the organizations consulted as to how &#8220;to find the best solution.&#8221; </p>
<p>In other words, race is not an issue when nearly a thousand young African-Americans pillage a largely white civic showcase, but race is the dominant theme when at best one out of a thousand non-violent citizens utters a racial slur in a protest that had absolutely nothing to do with race. </p>
<p>Is this what Obama&rsquo;s post-racial America was supposed to look like? {snip}</p>
<p>(snip) The police, of course, are hamstrung. Here, as everywhere in urban America, the Democrats and the local media have been quick to turn every aggrieved perp into a Scottsboro Boy. </p>
<p>Individual police officers have caught on. Last Saturday, even the most dedicated of them knew what they were looking at was 900 potential lawsuits  &mdash;  if not potential suspensions, terminations, or even imprisonments for making an ambiguous move in front of 900 cell-phone cameras in a racially charged environment. </p>
<p>And while Kansas City burns, Cleaver fiddles. Ironically, on April 10, the day of the Plaza riot, the Star ran a curious op-ed by Cleaver in which he called for more &#8220;civility&#8221; and &#8220;decorum&#8221; in political debate. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree.  The kinds of young black people who went on this wilding at CCP aren&rsquo;t the type that studiously read the news.  It&rsquo;s likely that not one of the wilders know that Emmanual &#8220;Leave it to&#8221; Cleaver is their Congressman.  Those young blacks don&rsquo;t even listen or read black political media.  <br>

		<p>These &#8220;smash mobs&#8221; in KC are part of a larger growing trend across the nation where Blacks have discovered that beating up on Whites and destroying property is a great time to be had. Soon America will descend into the chaos that France experiences from their African youths on a weekly basis. </p>

		<p>#2, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if most of them don&rsquo;t know Kansas City is in North America. A black person said that a white person did SOMETHING bad, and that&rsquo;s enough to get them going. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter whether it was true or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hate speech, but will never be treated as such. Heck, for that matter, all white guilt-tripping in the media and academia is hate speech that encourages violence against whites. </p>

		<p>This is a trend that has become all but impossible to hide in the age of Youtube and the internet.  These mass attacks on whites and in some cases, asians and hispanics,are occuring in Philly, New York City, Minn, Denver and several other cities across the country.  In many situations, the obama election and black power were used in taunts of the victims.  In none of the instances did the law enforcement community have the guts to call any of these events for what they were, racial crimes.</p>
<p>It is thought that the American White is too docile, too afraid of losing their job, too afraid of landing in a jail cell, or too afraid that they are alone in fighting back and cannot count on the police or other whites for assistance.  Perhaps that assumption is incorrect yet as we await for whites to find their spine, increasingly more heinous acts fall upon whites.  Perhaps some that call for a separate white homeland are on to a best solution.  After all, this genocide of white people in America did not begin until the so-called civil rights legislation beginning in the 1960&rsquo;s.  </p>

<p>Race is only the &ldquo;dominant issue,&rdquo; when a white so much as decides not to date a nonwhite, or otherwise stand up for themselves in any fashion. On the other hand, rape and pillage by nonwhites is only &ldquo;understandable venting&rdquo; in the face of &ldquo;institutionalized racism.&rdquo; What is new here?</p>
<p>The Communist Deputy of the People&rsquo;s Congress, Comrade Cleaver, clearly did hoax this &ldquo;incident.&rdquo; No tapes or video at least confirm his allegations; yet, they are an accepted &ldquo;truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what we have sunk to as a race: we are the doormats of nonwhite criminals and whorish white Reds.</p>
<p>Until we hold them accountable for their crimes and punish them accordingly, we get what we deserve.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>You&rsquo;re right Question Diversity.  Blacks have nothing to do with reading anything, and little or nothing to do with listening to any media news.  However, they DO listen to the drums talk, and an outright lie as told by Cleaver circulates verbally among the &#8220;aggrieved&#8221; like lightening.  And as we know, they do have cellphones.</p>

		<p>A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. </p>
<p>For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being a former Brookside area resident, I am awaiting with more than mild interest to learn what happens in the KC area this Saturday afternoon and Saturday night (April 17).  (These kids are not going to be getting out of bed until noon).</p>
<p>I would like to take 2,000 white guys into the Paseo area and sing Kumbaya to the little darlings.  Who was it that asked &#8220;Can&rsquo;t we all just get along?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Amren had a piece a while back on KC.  Just East of the CCP by about ten blocks you have a heavy black area.  Just North of that and abutting that same area is the Missouri Zip Code that has the greatest number of men on Missouri&rsquo;s Death Row.  And they are all black in that Zip Code.  I would link to the article here, but I don&rsquo;t recall the headline.  Anyone else recall that article?</p>

		<p>Cleaver?  Wasn&rsquo;t he a criminal in years past, just like the out of control black kids carrying on in KC now?  What a role model.  But the kids did what they did because they could get away with it and they knew it.  If you&rsquo;re white, try going into Gates&rsquo; Barbecue in KC some time - with a black acquaintance - and watch them serve good meat to the black person and dried out meat to you.  That happened to me about 15 years ago, and I don&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;s any different now.  Well, by now maybe a white person wouldn&rsquo;t dare go into Gates&rsquo;&hellip;.  I think the cops in KC used to have huevos, but, the kids were setting them up in this instance.  Hey, how about turning the fire hoses on?  That always worked in Alabama&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Why do all these conservative outlets like World Net Daily continue to pretend this stuff surprises them, and tippy-toe around the race issue, even when it is explicity clear that is THE critical issue? When race is so obviously the primary factor in the story, wouldn&rsquo;t that be the best time to be straight, to be courageous and just say it like it is?  </p>

		<p>I live in KC and the Country Club Plaza is the place where the very rich people shop. This is the first I&rsquo;ve heard about any of this because I&rsquo;m out of the country but 900 blacks roaming through the CCP spitting on people and pushing people around hopefully made a lot of converts. Doesn&rsquo;t this demonstrate how fragile and superficial the racial peace is. OK what little racial peace there is.</p>

<p>Surprising to see a news article admit what we all know know.  Not only has our demented PC environment given these people a license to act this way, but if the law tries to interfere there will be some video &#8220;evidence&#8221; of &#8220;brutality.&#8221;  BOOM! Ghetto lottery!  </p>
<p>It would be interesting to talk to a senator/congressman/representative about this incident and ask him to read that paragraph aloud.  Deep down he would know it to be 100% true yet he would squirm and pass the buck.  &#8220;the police said it wasn&rsquo;t racially&hellip;&#8221;  The only way to get the ball rolling is to shove it in their face and force their hand!  Otherwise we know they just hide from the truth like cowards hoping it will go away.   </p>

		<p>People pointing out that black youths don&rsquo;t read newspapers draw the wrong conclusion. They generally do not read the news which is precisely why they have such a warped view of current events as their perception of current events is severely distorted by  wild rumors and gossip. </p>
<p>Because of their willful ignorance we have large percentages of blacks believing such things as the government invented AIDS to wipe out Africa, the government bombed the levies in NO, white supremacist mobs attacked a black congressman etc.</p>

<p>Senators and congressmen know better than anyone what it is to live with blacks.  Since the 1940&rsquo;s DC has been a crime ridden black ghetto.  Congressmen, Senators, their families and employees are not immune to black on White crime.  Congressmen and Senators also have to deal with the most disfunctional city, county, state and federal affirmative action black affirmative action employees every time they go to the DMV, property tax, even dog license agency.</p>
<p>They know it all too well.  Why do you think Barbara Boxer&rsquo;s kids never lived with her in the DC area.  They stayed safe and secure in 99 percent White Marin County Ca.</p>

		<p>If what the story states is the case   &mdash;   that the black on White mob violence in KC was the result of the Tea Party incident   &mdash;   then this indicates that we are seeing a reversal of the lynch mobs of the century past. Now it is blacks who will assault innocent Whites over real or fabricated insults to one of their own. </p>
<p>Of course, it is &#8220;racist&#8221; for Whites to resist, or even point out, this reality. </p>

<p>Most, if not all, of the blacks that were lynched in the good old days were guilty as sin.  Communist propaganda would have you believe otherwise.</p>
<p>There is no way blacks could possibly win a race war against whites in Anerica.  At the first sign of that kind of trouble whites would become proactive.  Blacks that survived would be deported to Africa&hellip;   </p>
