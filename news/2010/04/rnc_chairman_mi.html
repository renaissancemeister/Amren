<h1>RNC Chairman Michael Steele Says He and Obama Have It Harder Because of Their Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brett Michael Dykes, Yahoo! News, April 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Embattled RNC Chairman Michael Steele broke his silence on the RNC fundraising scandal known as &#8220;bondage-gate&#8221; Monday morning when he sat down for an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC&rsquo;s &#8220;Good Morning America.&#8221; Expressing racial kinship with the man he spends a good deal of his time attacking, Steele said that because of the color of their skin, he and President Obama aren&rsquo;t granted much latitude for mistakes on the job.</p>
<p>Stephanopoulos, offering up a question from a viewer named &#8220;Myron&#8221; via his blog, asked, &#8220;Do you feel that, as an African-American, you have a slimmer margin for error than another chairman would?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The honest answer is yes,&#8221; said Steele responded. &#8220;Barack Obama has a slimmer margin. A lot of folks do. It&rsquo;s a different role for me to play and others to play and that&rsquo;s just the reality of it. But you take that as part of the nature of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House has already weighed in with a jaundiced view of Steele&rsquo;s racial observations. When a reporter sought comment at Monday morning&rsquo;s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called Steele&rsquo;s racial aside a &#8220;silly comment to make&#8221; and quipped, &#8220;I think Michael Steele&rsquo;s problem isn&rsquo;t the race card; it&rsquo;s the credit card.&#8221;<br>

		<p>If I&rsquo;ve heard this nonsense line of reasoning from blacks once, I&rsquo;ve heard it way too many times.  The goofy part about it is that most of the ones who complain that they have to work twice as hard and twice as long to get the same distance as a white person spend most of their time complaining about how hard they have to work, but not actually working hard.  </p>
<p>But it also works the other way   &mdash;   Be honest with yourself:  Can you think of any reason to have elevated Michael Steele to leading the RNC other than his race?  He has never won a public elected office in his own right (the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland is a running mate   &mdash;   all Steele was was Bob Ehrlich&rsquo;s running mate).  Steele is the GOP&rsquo;s Pelosi when it comes to private jets.  And that he has not been shown the door after handing the GOP charge plates to someone to use at one of those bereft-of-clothing clubs should tell you a lot.  His race makes it easier for him.</p>

		<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s pick an insecure black-man to head up the RNC; great strategy!&hellip;..I mean, that outta pick-up at least .000002% more of the black vote by doing so, right! /Sarc off. </p>
<p>What a joke! Steele is totally ineffective. He couldn&rsquo;t even get General Rectum Powell to vote for McCain in the last presidential election. </p>
<p>The late Sam Frances was too kind when he labled the GOP the &#8220;Stupid Party&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I just wrote the following to the RNC&hellip;FWIW&hellip;<br>
Dear Chairman Steele,<br>
Please step down.  I am disgusted at your panty waste comments to George Stephanopoulos Monday morning.  You claim that life is harder for you because of your race.  Ridiculous.  That is the kind of victim mentality that embodies the Democrat party, and should not be heard nor even thought in the Republican Party.  If I might be so bold, the main reason you are where you are is because of your race.  The pathetic Republican Party thought it had to do something to counter the Black Man At The Helm image of Barack Obama, ergo, black man at the helm of the Republican Party.  I am a white man.  I am sick and tired of hearing black men bitch about how hard they have it.  Again STEP DOWN.  As long as people like you lead the party, I will remain a FORMER Republican.</p>

<p>Well, I learned something new from him.  Before that incident I had no idea there was such a thing as a bondage restaurant.  &#8220;Handcufts with your mash potatoes?&#8221;  My diversity level was certainly increased by that little bit of knowledge.</p>
<p>Remember, it was a Republican, Jack Ryan, who gave us Senator Obama because of his shenanigans.  Not to mention the parade of &#8220;I hate gays&#8221; but pick up guys in the bus station GOP politicians.  I always thought Steele was an odd choice but perhaps he fits in better than we think.  At any rate they are stuck with him because to fire him would be racists!</p>

		<p>Lol&hellip;.he&rsquo;s got it exactly backwards.  Blacks are (for now) a protected class in the western world.  They regularly engage in outrageous behavior and are rarely sanctioned for it.  Increasingly, this extends to non-punishment of violent crime, especially when whites are the victims.</p>
<p>But I see that coming to an end soon.  Certainly, Steele is a good example.  Where America was hot to get behind Obama, for no other reason than he was black, Steele has a much cooler reception.</p>
<p>In a way, Obama has ruined it for him.</p>

		<p>If blacks are held to a higher standard, why the need for Affirmative Action? </p>
<p>Why must blacks be bussed from all black schools to all white schools, to achieve a better education, verses the other way around, even though all black schools receive nearly twice as much money per student as the white schools?</p>
<p>Why are blacks less likely to be given the death sentence for murder than the White Man? </p>
<p>Why are incompetent blacks promoted over whites when the whites pass the qualifying tests at a much higher rate than blacks? </p>
<p>Why the need for hate crime laws against whites, when blacks commit several times more racial hate crimes against whites than reverse? </p>
<p>The fact is, blacks are held to a much lower standard than whites<br>
because they are incapable of living up to the high standards whites can achieve.</p>

		<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>When I hear blacks and white liberals say that blacks have to work twice as hard as whites, what should I say?  I know how to handle most other anti-white comments, but not so much this it seems.  &#8220;How would you know?  Do you know what it took successful whites to get where they were at?  Are you saying whites don&rsquo;t work hard and are lazy?  Isn&rsquo;t that racist?&#8221;</p>
<p>I could say, &#8220;So you&rsquo;re saying because you&rsquo;re black you&rsquo;re racially and naturally inferior to whites that you have to work harder?  Sounds like you&rsquo;re the one whose the racist and not me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I won&rsquo;t keep my fingers crossed but I hope this leads up to his forced resignation at the RNC.  I can&rsquo;t believe some of the things this guy has said and done such as White people are afraid of him and his black assistants are paid quite a bit more, with your donations, than their White equivalents.  His hip hop Republican strategy has drawn scorn and ridicule and donations are down.  The midterm elections are coming up and this guy is poison to the Republican Party.</p>

		<p>When I screwed up as a child and my father had to punish me, he always told me to take my punishment as a MAN would. African Americans obviously can&rsquo;t be punished because to do so, is racist. As a consequence, Republicans are stuck with an incompetent chairman and the American people are stuck with an incompetent president&hellip;.</p>

<p>Brillant observation! The myth that blacks have to work &#8220;twice as hard&#8221; or &#8220;be the best&#8221; to get ahead is absurd on so many levels and is as ridiculous as the &#8220;last hired first fired&#8221; or &#8220;racism is alive and well&#8221; mantra we always hear. Anyone who has extensive work experience knows that blacks are hardly ever the most diligent or brightest employees. Spend time in an office with numerous African-Americans and you will probably end up losing weight and downing voluminous cups of coffee, as I did, due to the constant stress. And forget about going to HR if you are a white male because they will always side against you.</p>
<p>Btw, Ken Blackwell, a decent black conservative IMO, had this to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Former RNC rival takes shot at Steele: Race claims &#8216;ridiculous,&rsquo; &#8216;disturbing&rsquo;<br>
By Eric Zimmermann	 - 04/06/10 11:49 AM ET<br>
One of Steele&rsquo;s rivals for the RNC chairmanship took Steele to task Monday for attributing his problems to race.</p>
<p>Kenneth Blackwell, a former Ohio secretary of state who ran against Michael Steele for RNC chairman, said Steele&rsquo;s argument that he has a &#8220;smaller margin of error&#8221; beacuse he&rsquo;s black is &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This notion that this disturbing pattern of gaffes and missteps is now being criticized solely because he is black, and that Barack Obama is being criticized for his big-government power grab solely because he is black  &mdash;  that is nonsense,&#8221; Blackwell told Fox News&rsquo;s Neil Cavuto.</p>
<p>&#8220;And here&rsquo;s a person who is leading Lincoln&rsquo;s party, and now he&rsquo;s falling back on this crutch of race. That&rsquo;s disturbing,&#8221; Blackwell added.</p>
<p>Blackwell, who serves as co-chairman of the RNC&rsquo;s redistricting committee, declined to call for Steele to step down but urged the chairman to &#8220;right the ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can do that by saying, &#8216;Look, there&rsquo;s a disturbing pattern that calls for transparency. It calls for greater accountability,&rsquo;&#8221; Blackwell said.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Obama may be shrewd enough not to publically side with this guy, but the passages I read from The Audacity of Hope indicate a man obsessed with white villainy against downtrodden blacks.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a good one:</p>
<p>I knew of someone who was written up at work for something.  He was told by a black co-worker that his problem was, his skin wasn&rsquo;t black.</p>
<p>Later, this black co-worker gets fired for job performance  &mdash;  and then he screams racism.</p>
<p>Just trying to have it both ways.</p>
