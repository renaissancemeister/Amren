<h1>Japanese Guts Are Made for Sushi</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Schenkman, Science Now Daily News (Washington, D.C.), April 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Americans don&rsquo;t have the guts for sushi. At least that&rsquo;s the implication of a new study, which finds that Japanese people harbor enzymes in their intestinal bacteria that help them digest seaweed  &mdash;  enzymes that North Americans lack. What&rsquo;s more, Japanese may have first acquired these enzymes by eating bacteria that thrive on seaweed in the open ocean.</p>
<p>Mirjam Czjzek didn&rsquo;t set out to compare cross-cultural eating habits. Instead, the chemist at the Station Biologique de Roscoff, on the coast of Brittany in France, was interested in what it takes to digest a piece of seaweed. Unlike in land plants, the carbohydrates that make up seaweed are spangled with molecules of sulfur, so special enzymes are needed to break them down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The bacterium in question is known as Bacteroides plebeius, and it has been found only in Japanese people. Wondering whether the enzymes were unique to Japanese individuals, Czjzek&rsquo;s team compared the microbial genomes of 13 Japanese people with those of 18 North Americans. Five of the Japanese subjects harbored the enzyme, but among the North Americans, &#8220;we didn&rsquo;t find a single one,&#8221; says Czjzek, whose team reports its findings tomorrow in Nature.</p>
<p>Where would bacteria inside the human gut get ahold of a seaweed-digesting enzyme? Czjzek speculates that they could have grabbed it from bacteria that live on the seaweed. She notes, for example, that according to tax records dating back to the 8th century C.E., seaweed was used as a form of payment in Japanese society. {snip}</p>
<p>The ability to munch on a few extra carbohydrates might have given these gut bacteria a leg up over their thousands of competitors, says Czjzek. It also may help their human hosts. Because gut bacteria can squeeze energy from carbohydrates that human enzymes can&rsquo;t break down, these adapted microbes might help Japanese who dine on seaweed get more nutrition from their meal than do North Americans, she says.</p>
<p>Scientists have thought that gut bacteria might pick up genes from other microbes, a process known as lateral gene transfer, &#8220;but there hasn&rsquo;t been an example this clear before,&#8221; says Ruth Ley, a microbiologist at Cornell University. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s the first demonstration of how people&rsquo;s culture has impacted the [bacteria in the] gut.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Speaking as a sushi and sashimi lover, I find this very, VERY difficult to believe.</p>
<p>No white person I know that loves to eat sushi has ever had a problem, ever.</p>
<p>Not saying there aren&rsquo;t genetic differences in what foods various races can eat (milk is a prime example).  I am saying I see zero evidence of this with raw fish and seaweed.</p>

		<p>Interesting study, as far as its implications go.  However, 31 people divided into two groups hardly proves anything.  A much better study would involve many hundreds (from all walks of life) on both sides of the Pacific.  Otherwise, one could claim the results are due to pure chance.</p>

		<p>Given that the digestive enzyme is in their gut bacteria rather than produced by their own bodies, this is clearly an environmental difference rather than a genetic one.  Presumably if white people eat enough seaweed their gut bacteria will eventually acquire the enzyme as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat sushi often (the good stuff is expensive) but I&rsquo;ve never had any trouble digesting it.<br>

Thank you, thank you!   And it&rsquo;s all the more &#8220;chic&#8221;  if they could do it with chopsticks.</p>
<p>Another very important point to be made here is that you can get some HORRIBLE internal parasites from eating raw meat or fish.  It simply isn&rsquo;t worth it for whatever dubious pleasure is gained. For public health purposes alone,  the repulsive practice should be banned.</p>

		<p>2) It isn&rsquo;t so much about having &#8220;problems&#8221; eating sushi.  It&rsquo;s about the amount of nourishment you get from it because your system either can or can&rsquo;t efficiently digest it.</p>
<p>A lot of asians have the same problem with milk.</p>

		<p>People in the US eat sushi because:<br>
   (1)  it has omega-3 fatty acids undamaged by heat<br>
   (2)  it is low-fat otherwise:  the vinegar helps the starch go down without grease<br>
   (3)  it is palate-stimulating (ginger, wasabi) without gut-frying hot pepper<br>
   (4)  it tastes clean and doesn&rsquo;t make bad breath<br>
   (5)  some people say they feel a &#8220;high&#8221; from sushi  &mdash;  they debate whether it&rsquo;s the wasabi or the ginger or the fish itself</p>
<p>If they eat it with chopsticks, more likely than not it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t want possibly-dirty fingers on it. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there some US law requiring sashimi and sushi fish to be frozen to -40 degrees F., to kill parasites?  </p>

		<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time higher animals hijacked enzymes via lateral gene transfer from bacteria.  Six-eyed spiders (which include the brown recluse as well as the Namibian sand spider) appeared to have done this millions of years ago.  Their venom includes an enzyme that causes the characteristic growing necrosis of tissue around the bite, which is quite unlike the neurotoxic, hemotoxic and cytotoxic compounds normally found in animal venoms, but is common in bacteria.</p>
<p>That said, digesting nori seaweed and raw fish has never caused me any problems.  The advantage Japanese possess in this respect must therefore be a small one&hellip; BUT even a small advantage in metabolizing nutrients will pay off over generations of food scarcity.  Caucasians enjoy a superior ability to metabolize lactose in milk, while other races are frequently lactose-intolerant (even brewer&rsquo;s yeast, which can handle nearly any sort of sugar can not metabolize lactose).</p>
<p>Kelp is consumed in some coastal areas of Ireland.  It would be interesting to know whether Irish have developed any similar advantages.</p>

		<p>I think this comes under the heading of &#8220;bunko science.&#8221;  This is NONSENSE - I&rsquo;ve been eating  nori (seaweed), raw salmon and tuna, and salmon eggs since I was in my 20&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;m now in my 60&rsquo;s   &mdash;   with never an uncomfortable moment from this food.  I LOVE Japanese food.  And I am half German, with the rest Irish, French, and Cherokee.  Not a Japanese gene in the bunch.  So, everyone, this is what my grandchild calls &#8220;doodoo&#8221; research.  A pox on it!</p>

		<p>I am very white and have been eating and enjoying sushi and other Japanese delicacies for longer than most of you posters have been alive. I started exploring Japanese food as a very young sailor in Japan when it was still &#8220;occupied Japan&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t think there was any &#8220;culturally sophisticated&#8221; or &#8220;chic&#8221; thing about it. As for chopsticks, it was either learn to use them or starve, as there weren&rsquo;t any knives or forks around. We learned!</p>
<p>I will concede though that the Japanese digestive system may be very different from our white digestive tract, so perhaps a Japanese person is having a totally different experience from eating sushi than I do, just as I may have a different experience while watching baseball than a Japanese fan has while watching beisboru.</p>

		<p>Sorry to Anonymous and Also Anonymous, but here in Italy eating raw seafood is quite common.  Many of my friends from Naples routinely order raw fish and seafood as an appetizer.  You are certainly right about the parasites though, it seems that everyone knows someone who has gotten sick from going to the wrong restaurant, and certain seafood has a reputation as being riskier than others, with mussels being quite dicey.  I&rsquo;ve even eaten fresh raw shrimp and I was fine.</p>
<p>Raw beef filet (&#8220;carpaccio&#8221;) is sliced thin and commonly served with arugula and flakes of grana padano cheese and is very tasty.  </p>
<p>Many Italian grandmothers crack the top off a freshly laid raw egg and squeeze lemon into it for their grandchildren to eat with a spoon as a snack.  </p>
<p>Raw food isn&rsquo;t that dangerous as long as you&rsquo;re sure about the source.</p>

<p>Although I get where you are coming from with this (there are alot of things liberals do and eat that they don&rsquo;t actually enjoy but they do it so they can pretend to be different, and hence, superior, to others) sushi isn&rsquo;t one of these.  Yes, it&rsquo;s different.  But it&rsquo;s also tasty (and not tasty as in an acquired taste&hellip;.tasty as in many people who may have never tried it will like it if they do).</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t spend too much for it.  It&rsquo;s actually bar food (the japanese version of buffalo wings being snacked on when out drinking beer).  Ten bucks for lunch is about right.  More than that and you are in snooty white liberal territory trying to be different.  Heck, one of my favorite places to get sushi is the food court at my mall.  It&rsquo;s a bit of a pain to wait (the ten minutes or so) as they guy makes it fresh as I stand in line but it&rsquo;s really not that big of a stretch from say, getting chicken nuggets from the Wendy&rsquo;s located right next to him.  Just a change of pace.</p>

Maybe so in Italy. But the original comment referred to most &#8220;Americans&#8221; finding it disgusting, not Italians.</p>
<p>In Italy, horsemeat is also popular, and Steak Tartare (raw hamburger) is eaten there too and in some other European countries. It is a wonderful way to get tapeworm, if that&rsquo;s your idea of good eating. Tapeworms can also be gotten from undercooked fish, as well as flukes, and many other parasites. No thanks, this American can do without it. I&rsquo;ll take my food cooked. I thought humans got past all that when fire was discovered.</p>

<p>Horse meat is also popular in France, Austria, Belgium, Iceland and even Germany (where, by the way, it is often added to sauerbraten).  Horse meat is high in protein, low in fat and calories (relative to beef, anwyway).  The aversion to horse meat among many cultures (like the U.S.) is mainly due to the adoption of the horse as a type of pet, as well as religious scruples (Jews and some Christians, for example, are forbidden to eat it).  Medical authorities have no problem with it as long as it&rsquo;s cooked properly.</p>
<p>Getting tapeworm from eating steak tartare would be the least of your problems.  Steak tartare (basically a raw egg served over raw hamburger) is a breeding ground for E. coli, Listeria and Salmonella, three potentially deadly bacteria.  Anyone who eats steak tartare is playing Russian roulette with their health, and maybe their life!</p>
<p>It should be noted the USDA forbids the sale of raw fish in the United Stated unless it&rsquo;s been frozen first, in order to kill any parasites it might contain.  Of course, freezing does NOT destroy any bacteria or viruses.  Like the Romans used to say: &#8220;Caveat emptor.&#8221;</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a single culture on earth whose members consume a certain foodstuff someone else doesn&rsquo;t find disgusting for whatever reasons.  America is no exception.  Pork consumption, for example, which is very popular here, is viewed as abhorrent by hundreds of millions of Moslems.  Observant Jews and Seventh Day Adventists likewise shun it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Have you noticed Asian cusine totally lacks cheese&#8221;?</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Brendan</p>
<p>Absolutely.  Japanese in particular tend to consider cheese rotten milk, especially bleu cheese (one of my favorites).  I found this somewhat strange, because they do some quite ghastly things with bean curd, fermenting until it is rotten.  This is &#8220;natto&#8221;.  I thoroughly like the food there, with only a few exceptions.  The natto maki (sushi rolls) I had when my hosts were trying to ascertain whether there was actually anything I WOULDN&rsquo;T eat were bad, but manageable (it impressed my hosts), and the traditional Japanese breakfast my hotel served just contained too much salt for early mornings for my stomach to be happy.</p>
<p>Chinese make yoghurt, and it is a common enough breakfast food, but I didn&rsquo;t see cheese once during a month there.  The really bizarre food - to my taste - there was sea cucumber (not a plant at all, but a weird echidnoderm related to sea urchins).  Apparently it is something of a delicacy.  I was unimpressed.</p>
<p>In parts of southern Europe - France, Spain and Italy, snails are eaten - with lots of garlic and butter (and while eating snails sounds odd, they&rsquo;re very good).</p>
<p>As Anonymous 9:09 PM said above, there isn&rsquo;t a single culture that hasn&rsquo;t developed a food item that some others consider disgusting.  Even what constitutes &#8220;normal&#8221; pizza toppings will vary widely from one nation to another.  In Germany, saurkraut is a frequent topping (and bacon &amp; saurkraut on a pizza is a very good combination).  In Saudi Arabia, one is likely to encounter tuna on pizza.  I&rsquo;m a bit dubious about that one.  At home, I frequently make pizzas with bleu cheese dressing as a substitute for the marinara sauce, which raised eyebrows on both my mother and wife.</p>
<p>As a concluding note about sushi, not everything is served raw.  Anago - eel (one of my favorites) - is smoked.</p>

<p>The idea is disgusting, until you try it. I&rsquo;m not putting on airs, either. Afterwards it just tastes awesome. And I hate seaweed, but is it a necessary ingredient in sushi? Not in my experience. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of sushi rolls made without seaweed.<br>

		<p>Three points:</p>
<p>First, the extra enzymes from the gut bacteria in Japanese people discovered here appear (as some other comments have pointed out) to have been acquired from bacteria that normally eat seaweed.</p>
<p>Second, this isn&rsquo;t like lactose-intolerance; this is more like the difference between humans and cows in the ability to digest grass.  These bacteria appear to derive some nutritional value from the seaweed in sushi; lacking them does not cause a reaction similar to lactose-intolerance, it simply means that the seaweed won&rsquo;t be digested, much like what happens when you fail to thoroughly chew corn  &mdash;  bits of it come out your other end intact.  (I wish I had a less unpleasant way to phrase that.)</p>
<p>Third, not all sushi involves raw fish.  The term &#8220;sushi&#8221; actually refers to the rice, and certain kinds of seafood used in sushi rolls are ALWAYS cooked.  (Mostly crab, shrimp, and eel.)  Also, anything &#8220;Tempura&#8221; is fried.  I must be weird  &mdash;  I like sushi, but won&rsquo;t eat raw fish.</p>
