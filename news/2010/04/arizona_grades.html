<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Arizona Department of Education recently began telling school districts that teachers whose spoken English it deems to be heavily accented or ungrammatical must be removed from classes for students still learning English.</p>
<p>State education officials say the move is intended to ensure that students with limited English have teachers who speak the language flawlessly. But some school principals and administrators say the department is imposing arbitrary fluency standards that could undermine students by thinning the ranks of experienced educators.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just one more indication of the incredible anti-immigrant sentiment in the state,&#8221; said Bruce Merrill, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University who conducts public-opinion research.</p>
<p>Margaret Dugan, deputy superintendent of the state&rsquo;s schools, disagreed, saying that critics were &#8220;politicizing the educational environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Arizona hired hundreds of teachers whose first language was Spanish as part of a broad bilingual-education program. Many were recruited from Latin America.</p>
<p>Then in 2000, voters passed a ballot measure stipulating that instruction be offered only in English. Bilingual teachers who had been instructing in Spanish switched to English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s enforcement of fluency standards is based on an interpretation of the federal No Child Left Behind Act. That law states that for a school to receive federal funds, students learning English must be instructed by teachers fluent in the language. Defining fluency is left to each state, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Education said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teachers that don&rsquo;t pass muster may take classes or other steps to improve their English; if fluency continues to be a problem, Ms. Santa Cruz [Adela Santa Cruz, director of the Arizona education-department office charged with enforcing standards in classes for students with limited English] said, it is up to school districts to decide whether to fire teachers or reassign them to mainstream classes not designated for students still learning to speak English. However, teachers shouldn&rsquo;t continue to work in classes for non-native English speakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John Hartsell, spokesman for the Arizona Education Association, a union that represents 34,000 teachers, said the recent focus on fluency was a distraction from more important issues. &#8220;This is not the time to be pressuring districts to deal with accents that have nothing to do with quality teaching; we are trying to figure out how to best fund operations&#8221; because of cuts in education, he said.</p>
<p>State education officials deny any discrimination against teachers, saying they are acting in students&rsquo; best interest.</p>
<p>Ms. Santa Cruz, the state official, said evaluators weren&rsquo;t looking at accents alone. &#8220;We look at the best models for English pronunciation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It becomes an issue when pronunciation affects comprehensibility.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have heard teachers in Baltimore I couldn&rsquo;t understand. Several were math teachers   &mdash;  from Pakistan, Nigeria, etc. AND some were blacks born right here in Baltimore. Go figure. And I&rsquo;m pretty adroit at translating ebonics, having lived in a &#8220;bilingual&#8221; city for half a century.</p>

		<p>It should go further and ban teachers with limited English proficieny from teaching any classes at all to English speaking students.  I was enrolled at UACT in Tempe back in 1998 and was taking an advanced mathematics class being taught by an instructor from Peru whose English was choppy and difficult to understand.  Several of us complained about him and I finally had to drop the class and retake it a semester later with a different instructor. </p>

<p>I agree!  While I was getting my undergraduate degree we had a computer science instructor from India (this was 1980).  He was impossible to undertsand.  We would just stare at each other trying to catch a word or two.  Fortunately the smarter kids helped those of us who couldn&rsquo;t get it from just reading our text book and experimenting with punch cards.  </p>
<p>Physics lab was a disaster.  The Chinese teaching assistants were impossible to understand.  Once again the smart kids helped those of us who cwere not quite so adept at self-instruction!</p>
<p>I am sure it is much worse today.</p>

		<p>Who can understand even one&rsquo;s own doctor anymore? Most are foreigners with heavy accents.  How about those calls we get with the tell tale voice of a foreigner and the companies that hire them? Ever try to talk and make some sense with a government agency such as SSA or any other that have diversity hiring practices? </p>

So these teachers are now going to be re-assigned to teach Biology to non-ESL students. Great, that reminds me of a reqired high stakes 5 semester hour<br/>
Statistics 211 course I took in college under a recently arrived chain smoking instructor from Greece whose English was barely intelligible. I (along with 15 out of the class of 20 made an F or D and hade to repeat the course. I took it a semester later and made a high B with the Chairman of The Economics Department as the professor. </p>
<p>Now the state supported university system in NC actually has an office and a mechanism at The Dean of Students level that addresses student complaints regarding the English coherency/intelligibility of imported professors. </p>
<p>This story also brings to mind the U.S. Department of Justus crime reporting statistics that are compliled by calling Hispanic perps &#8220;White&#8221; and Hispanic victims of crime &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I had a Chinese foreign lab instructor for a geography course I took at university. He simply could not make himself understood and would fly into a temper tantrum when we asked him to repeat what he&rsquo;d said in English&hellip; please!!! Needless to say, I had to rely on the textbook to learn everything I needed to learn - my &#8216;instructor&rsquo; was of no use whatsoever.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if a Southern dialect would be considered, by them, to be &#8220;heavily accented&#8221;.  I hope not; Southern American English is as legitimate as any other, if not more so.</p>

		<p>Another fine example of the train wreck that is public education. We can&rsquo;t rely on it (anymore) to produce students that can actually understand and eventually teach Math and hard sciences. I guess all that money they put into getting us to nag our parents to quit smoking (this was an in-vogue cause 35 years ago) was more important than &hellip;.(fill in the blank). </p>
<p>My experience muddled English was with a pre-calculus course in college after some time in the service. The instructor fled from Iran after the Shah was deposed and his family members who remained behind went from upper middle class to abject poverty. I ended up retaking the course some time later when I could get into a class taught by an American. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on math tutors from India or China. </p>

		<p>I see a major loophole in that this legislation mentions teachers, but not specifically teaching assistants. Like some of the previous posters, I had my share of college classes taught by those with limited English. But at least in my case (at George Washington University)the biggest problem was the professors who handed off too much classroom instruction to their (ESL) teaching assistants. </p>
<p>The mentality seemed to be that as long as they were not teaching English, their limited English should not be a problem.</p>

		<p>My brother couldn&rsquo;t understand why his daughter was not doing well in English until he went to a conference at the school and had to struggle to understand the teacher.  The teacher was Hispanic and very difficult to understand.  My brother had his daughter moved to another classroom and the problem was solved.</p>

<p>I think the spirit of the law is to promote an environment where students are able to learn.  There&rsquo;s absolutely no difficulty in understanding a Southern dialect compared to a third world instructor who sounds like he was plucked from an outsourced call center.  </p>

		<p>What!  The teachers have to speak correctly?  How dare they ask this of them!  I&rsquo;m going to call the ACLU!  Teachers are not required to communicate properly in other states.  In Urban areas they can teach in ebonics!  What are they thinking in Arizona?  They must be elitists or something!</p>
<p>And while they&rsquo;re at it, who ever said that teachers need to know something about their subjects?  Social justice themes are all kids need to learn these days.  Yeah, forget math or literature or geography - let&rsquo;s focus on the history of oppression against non-whites in all of those fields.  </p>

		<p>The truth is that the United States is a country where teaching children proper English is secondary to affirmative action.</p>
<p>Likewise, hiring the best doctors, lawyers, educators, engineers, or anyone else is secondary to skin color.</p>
<p>The United States government, academia, and corporate bureaucracies are established to make personnel selections and decisions based on skin color.</p>
<p>Whites are not included in the process unless they are *extremely* wealthy and have already solidified their positions or power of the rest of us.</p>

		<p>Many Spanish speaking Hispanics walk out of University with a meaningless cultural studies degree and right into the classroom of an non-native English language class.  Administrators are pressured to higher hispanics and most of them don&rsquo;t have the credentials to teach a subject other than Spanish or ESL.  </p>
<p>Also, isn&rsquo;t it extremely frightening when you hear an English teacher make a mistake of grammar?</p>

		<p>Kids are going to copy exactly what they hear when they learn a language, which is why the vast majority of Hispanics speak with a Spanish accent.  They learn English from their siblings and peers, and often from a teacher at school who ALSO has an Hispanic accent.  So I don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s a problem to demand that English teachers speak clearly and without an accent (i.e., be native English speakers!)  That is demanded in every other foreign language class setting that I know of.  I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s discriminatory at all.</p>

<p>Bad enough for the USA.  But from what I see coming out of England today (newspapers, etc.), the impression given is that English is no long spoken even in England!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll wager that many of those &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; can&rsquo;t even speak or write grammatical Spanish, much less  comprehensible English.</p>

		<p>Lately, I have seen many teachers, recruited from the Philippines, to teach&hellip;.You guessed it English!</p>
<p>One, I was told by the administration that hired her, was God&rsquo;s-gift to the English department as she had received many awards, accolades and that we other (implied lesser-quality) teachers could &#8216;learn a lot from her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even teach English but was expected to go to &#8216;professional developments&rsquo; conducted by this woman as to how to improve my teaching and English-language skills.</p>
<p>I worked in front of this &#8216;God&rsquo;s-gift&rsquo; teacher for a year and never did understand one word she said as her English was utterly garbled and incomprehensible. </p>
<p>It would be surreal, but then the entire K-12 educational system defies reality and common sense.</p>
<p>On another note, a few years ago, a new student teacher was placed in my daughter&rsquo;s honors Algebra II classroom (a real, hard-core Alg II honors class, not what passes for Alg II these days).  The student teacher hailed from some un-named Eastern European country (as you can imagine, she immediately became known as &#8216;Borat&rsquo;).</p>
<p>My daughter tearfully told me after school that she couldn&rsquo;t understand a word the woman said and couldn&rsquo;t understand her method of teaching.  I was going to call the school the next day but it seems like 30 other parents beat me to it-by the end of the week, a few days later, she was gone and the regular teacher came back.</p>
<p>I found out later &#8216;Borat&rsquo; was assigned to another math class, not honors or AP  &mdash;  I guess the administrators figured there would be fewer parent complaints,</p>
<p>On a final note:  My daughter tells me at UC Berkeley, students can go on-line to look at student-generated ratings of professors.  She says everyone does this, takes note and plans accordingly.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in agreement with #22 White Slave </p>
<p>A number of years ago, a group of reservists came for their two weeks of annual training. One of the people in this group was an IT manager for an insurance company in the civilian world. Over coffee he told me about one of his projects. This firm wanted to find out how to hire customer service reps so as to minimize the amount of turnover (these jobs tend to have 100+% a year turnover). This was before the days of cost effectively outsourcing these jobs to India. They came to the conclusion that people with more than a year of college or those who didn&rsquo;t have serious family obligations would ditch the job as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Very few white males stayed for any length of time, especially as soon as they discovered that they would be stuck in a dead end job with XYZ corporation. As with Dilbert, if you wanted to advance, you needed to go to another company. This company had a number of government contracts and was under incredible pressure to hire and promote women and minorities. Finding NAM for IT is a herculean task at best, so this firm had to hire whites to fill these positions. </p>
<p>I wonder how many places now employ people who can barely speak English so that they can be much bigger road blocks and just try to force you to give up. I&rsquo;m sure that there are studies out there that show that for everyone who tries to get a $50 - $100 problem fixed by trying to break through the Hindu wall, a number of others just give up. Let some place advertise that &#8220;We hire Americans who speak English for customer service&#8221;, and people will beat a path to your door. Then you are now in the sights of Uncle Sam and targeted for destruction. </p>

		<p>I recently made a call to my local city government to complain about a broken sidewalk.  The women who answered the phone had such a thick ebonics accent that I literally strained to understand her, even as I could tell she was straining to speak as correctly as possible.  It was painful and it soured me on accents on so many levels.  </p>
<p>I also had a computer problem recently and was patched through to some call center tech in India (I could tell by the accent) even though they always identify themselves with lily white names.  &#8220;Hello there.  Good day to you, Sir. My name is William, I will going to be your technician for this day!&#8221;  </p>
<p>I also could barely understand him, and the condescending tone in his voice was annoying to say the least.  At the end of the day, though, if our nation will be majority latino in 30-40 years, does any of our complaining even matter?  Our kids and grandkids will be needing to learn Spanish.  It seems inevitable.  </p>
<p>Where I live, I use my high school Spanish all the time by necessity, even though back when I was learning it, there seemed no need for it other than to take a random foreign language class rather than another math class.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree! While I was getting my undergraduate degree we had a computer science instructor from India (this was 1980). He was impossible to undertsand. We would just stare at each other trying to catch a word or two. Fortunately the smarter kids helped those of us who couldn&rsquo;t get it from just reading our text book and experimenting with punch cards. </p>
<p>Physics lab was a disaster. The Chinese teaching assistants were impossible to understand. Once again the smart kids helped those of us who cwere not quite so adept at self-instruction!</p>
<p>I am sure it is much worse today.</p>

Who can understand even one&rsquo;s own doctor anymore? Most are foreigners with heavy accents. How about those calls we get with the tell tale voice of a foreigner and the companies that hire them? Ever try to talk and make some sense with a government agency such as SSA or any other that have diversity hiring practices? &#8220;</p>
<p>I experienced the Indian teacher in college in 1980 also!  The reason that foreign MDs are increasing in the US is the same reason for the teachers - in subjects Americans were masters of then, like computer science and physics, they were cheap and plentiful.  Another reason is that our own physicists were engaged by NASA or US Defense contractors, so foreigners were needed for students.  But overall it is not dissimilar to the cheap Hispanic labor draw for farmers and construction, as well as big box corporations like Wall Mart.  So the traditional right wing corporate lobbying is against the people, as well as the left wing, One World socialism ideal; Americans loose.</p>
<p>The problem beneath the problem for foreign MDs is little known and discussed.  In the US healthcare system, one or two doctors decide on diagnosis and treatment.  They atend college for more years than every foreign model I know of, including the four year British system and the typical four year Slavic model.  Third world countries like Africa, Mexico, India, etc., imitate one of these basic models.  The difference is that in those models they have socialized medicine.  At those hospitals, a forum of doctors discuss and decide the course in difficult cases.  The young doctors learn from the old doctors.  I lived and worked in an Eastern European country for a few years and observed this practice.  The problem we are creating is that in our system, we have insurance companies that interferre with diagnosis and treatments and doctors hospitals that are profit driven.  Doctors compete with one another.  There are efforts being made to find ways to share medical information between doctors and hospitals via the internet (while remaining in line with increasingly strict HIPPA rules) to avoid increasing medical mistakes.  Thrusting four year MDs into this system will guarantee that more mistakes occur.  And this doesn&rsquo;t even begin to touch upon the problems of foreign language problems in administration and things like record making and keeping.  It is a can of worms beyond comprehension for most people, even in the health care professions.  They are restricted from recognizing the nature of these problems because of diversity rules, and fear of being labeled a racist.  But I think it is easy to predict that the American health care system is going to continue to deterioate and serve fewer people effectively.  It will increasingly loose money and perhaps collapse, while lending aid to the trend toward community and nationwide &#8220;Balkanisation.&#8221;  When that time arrives when we see the inevitable pandemic, the catastrophe will be compounded by the specter of communication barriers and the loose of all data as computer networks collapse and electric plants fail.</p>
<p>I am stockpiling medical supplies and boning up on first aid, along with other common disaster supplies.  But I will only be useful to a limited number of people nearby me.</p>

<p>Ditto with me.  At that time, there was no perceived &#8220;need&#8221;  for it.  It  was  just a subject of interest,  not of necessity.  </p>
<p>But anyway,   if that all comes to pass,  my own guess is that Spanish will only be a passing phase, nothing more, on the way to Chinese or Hindustani&hellip; or perhaps Arabic.   </p>
<p>The Latinos, once in possession of North America, will soon  find that they are unable to hold onto it.  There will be hungrier wolves  prowling at their door. At least the wiser ones among them will wish that they had left well enough alone &hellip;  back in the bad old days when the White Man was running things: when electric switches and water faucets worked, when there was garbage collection and police protection and welfare checks. When you could even vote, your voice could be heard and it meant something. You could even protest!!!   Ah, the bad old days!</p>

		<p>[quote]When learning a foreign language, it is best to learn from a native speaker of that foreign language. Students learning to speak English should learn from native English speakers. It&rsquo;s that simple.[/quote]</p>
<p>Makes sense to me.  I&rsquo;m a white American teaching English in Japan.  The Japanese import thousands of folks like me to teach here.  Some of the dodgier schools have started hiring Filipinos and Pakistanis to teach English.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me and my friends, the Japanese students/customers generally don&rsquo;t believe such people can teach English properly.  Xenophobia/Aesthetic Prop actually provides me with some modicum of job security.  Phew!</p>
