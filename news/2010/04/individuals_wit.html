<h1><a href="https://www.livescience.com/culture/sexism-racism-social-stereotypes-100412.html">Individuals with Rare Disorder Have No Racial Biases</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin Nixon, LiveScience, April 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Never has a human population been found that has no racial stereotypes. Not in other cultures or far-flung countries. Nor among tiny tots or people with various psychological conditions.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Children with Williams syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that makes them lack normal social anxiety, have no racial biases. They do, however, traffic in gender stereotypes, said study researcher Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg of the University of Heidelberg in Germany.</p>
<p>Normally, children show clear preferences for their own ethnic group by the age of three, if not sooner, other research has shown.</p>
<p>And, indeed, the children in this study without Williams syndrome reliably assigned good traits, such as friendliness, to pictures of people the same race as themselves. When asked something negative, such as &#8220;which is the naughty boy,&#8221; they overwhelmingly pointed to the other race.</p>
<p>Children with Williams syndrome, however, were equally likely to point to the white or black child as naughty or friendly.</p>
<p>While this study was done with white children, other research has shown that blacks and people of other races also think more highly of their own, Meyer-Lindenberg told LiveScience.</p>
<p>Williams syndrome is caused by a gene deletion known to affect the brain as well as other organs. As a result, people with Williams syndrome are &#8220;hypersocial,&#8221; Meyer-Lindenberg told . They do not experience the jitters and inhibitions the rest of us feel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They will put themselves at great peril to help someone and despite their skills at empathy, are unable to process social danger signals. As a result, they are at increased risk for rape and physical attack.</p>
<p><b>Nature or nurture?</b></p>
<p>While the first human population to demonstrate race-neutrality is missing critical genes, &#8220;we are not saying that this is all biologically-based and you can&rsquo;t do anything about it,&#8221; Meyer-Lindenberg said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study does show, however, that racism requires social fear. &#8220;If social fear was culturally reduced, racial stereotypes could also be reduced,&#8221; Meyer-Lindenberg said.</p>
<p>Despite their lack of racial bias, children with Williams syndrome hold gender stereotypes just as strongly as normal children, the study found. {snip}</p>
<p>The fact that Williams syndrome kids think of men and women differently, but not blacks and whites, shows that sex stereotypes are not caused by social anxiety, Meyer-Lindenberg said.</p>
<p>This may be because we learn about gender within &#8220;safe&#8221; home environments, while a different race is usually a sign of someone outside our immediate kin. (Studies to test this explanation, such as with racially-mixed families, have not yet been done.)</p>
<p>Racial biases are likely rooted in a general fear of others, while gender stereotypes may arise from sweeping generalizations, Meyer-Lindenberg said. &#8220;You watch mother make the meals, so you generalize this to everyone female.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>In their heads</b></p>
<p>Due to the present study, we now know that &#8220;gender and race are processed by different brain mechanisms,&#8221; Meyer-Lindenberg said, although those involved in gender are less understood.</p>

		<p>Well, by all means, let&rsquo;s eliminate that gene from the next generation!  Maybe that will appease the blacks if they have a whole generation of unaware sheep without the inbuilt fear mechanism to slaughter.  Fear and racial awareness is an instinctive necessary trait for survival, acquired over eons.  It&rsquo;s a GOOD thing.  For instance, one is much more wary around a panther than a kitty cat.  And one should be much more aware around a Black Panther than one is around a white Boy Scout.  But hey.  The liberals and social engineers can now guarantee 100% white cluelessness and ready made victims.  The brainwashing in the public schools wasn&rsquo;t achieving the desired 100% cluelessness concerning the danger blacks pose.</p>

		<p>At least they were consistent in studying all races and noticing that all races prefer their own.  However, what&rsquo;s the harm in being around your own race and working around your own race, etc?

<p>It would be an interesting study if conversely they found that people who suffer with social anxiety have higher rates of racial biases.  Sadly these children with Williams syndrome are developmentally challenged.  Perhaps there is a relationship between lower IQ and lack of racial bias. <br>

		<p>The cure for Williams Syndrome would be a heavy dose of African American studies followed with an injection of affirmative action along with a dose of FBI crime stats according to race.That should clear the disorder up in a hurry.Common sense could be One of side effects developed from the cure.</p>

		<p>So the only people with no real racial biases have a genetic defect that puts them in increased risk for rape and physical attack.</p>
<p>Thats&hellip; immensely amusing.  Remember that story here on amren(I can&rsquo;t seem to find it via search) about the white liberal in London who got violently attacked by blacks three times(the third time he got his skull bashed in and ended up in the hospital) and still couldn&rsquo;t make the obvious connection regarding race?</p>
<p>Makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>As a side note, the &#8216;apparently he didn&rsquo;t get hit hard enough&rsquo; comments on the article both on amren and the original UK publication&rsquo;s website were downright hilarious.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If social fear was culturally reduced, racial stereotypes could also be reduced.&#8221;  What does this mean?<br>
     1. If the various non-White groups stopped behaving stereotypically, racial stereotypes would be reduced?  <br>
     2. If Whites were indoctrinated to never show discomfort around non-Whites, we would then ignore the stereotypical behavior?  <br>
     3. If we never had to deal with non-Whites, we would be ignorant of them, and thereby have no stereotypes?  <br>

<p>Well, as a somewhat shy introvert, I never thought of the lack of social anxiety as a &#8220;disorder,&#8221; but I&rsquo;m happy to learn otherwise. It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that the lack of racial biases is also seen as a disorder.</p>

<p>Just what is this study attempting to point out?  That it is better to have a genetic syndrome that renders you a vegetable than to notice differences and wish to be with your own kind.  Perhaps lobotomies will soon be the preferred treatment for &#8220;racists?&#8221;<br>

Basing a study on retards makes the so called scientists more retard or just hungry for Government money.

<p>I have no doubt   &mdash;   no doubt at all!   &mdash;    that some militant zealots would consider this an acceptable cure for &#8220;racism&#8221;.  They would greatly prefer a non-racist vegetable to a race-conscious genius.  No question about it!</p>

		<p>When Whites suppress their genetically given ethnocentricity, which non-White populations can they count on to reciprocate?</p>
<p>Only those in which Williams syndrome is universal. The rest, being genetically normal human beings, will remain ethnocentric.</p>
<p>The promise of the civil rights project, to end bad relations between the races by favoring Blacks, was folly; not just politically, not just culturally, but because it was contrary to genetics.</p>
<p>A good future for Whites must be based on self-awareness as a collective with common interests and a successful struggle to defend those interests against competition by other races. It cannot be based on the rest of mankind acting contrary to the laws of genetics.</p>

<p>The point is, we can&rsquo;t. We have to internalize the fact that the rest of mankind, except for those few poor creatures with Williams syndrome, will remain ethnocentric whatever we do. It&rsquo;s genetically inevitable.</p>

<p>Please allow me to correct you.  The &#8220;civil rights project&#8221; as you call it, was never meant to  &#8220;favor blacks&#8221;.  In fact, we were assured and promised, way back then, that there would be no racial preferences or favoritism of any kind. Affirmative action was laughed off as just silly nonsense that paranoid whites were worried about. Civil rights promoters had no such thing in mind, we were told.</p>
<p>Of course, it didn&rsquo;t work out that way, and one thing led to another.</p>

		<p>People with this disorder may have retardation, but they&rsquo;re usually AMAZING musical talents as well. Not all genetic differences constitute negative errors, which is a concept I think many of you on here would most assuredly agree with.  </p>
