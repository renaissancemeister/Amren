			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Nicholas, Los Angeles Times, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Advocates for illegal immigrants fear the White House is doing the bare minimum to appease Latino voters before the midterm elections in November, while concentrating its efforts on other issues it considers more urgent.</p>
<p>A White House commitment to overhaul the nation&rsquo;s immigration system this year is collapsing, with the Obama administration undecided about the best way to proceed on an issue the president had identified as a top priority.</p>
<p>Immigration advocates who meet regularly with White House officials said the Obama administration had been considering several approaches, including convening a summit meeting devoted to the issue and putting forward its own bill. Those who attended a session Friday with administration officials said they came away with no indication the White House had settled on a course of action.</p>
<p>&#8220;He made some commitments that he&rsquo;s supposed to be delivering on,&#8221; said Angela Kelley, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, a think tank with close ties to the Obama White House. &#8220;And that was over a month ago. So everybody can look at the calendar and make a pretty educated guess about how many days we have to get immigration done.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The critical ingredient for whether we get immigration reform done this year will be whether the president has the courage to step forward and lead,&#8221; said Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, an advocacy group for low-income people and minority groups. &#8220;That is the indispensible ingredient.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), once a proponent of a sweeping immigration overhaul, released a 10-point plan on Monday that focused exclusively on border security.</p>
<p>Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), a supporter of the 10-point plan, said in an interview: &#8220;The prospects this year are not very good&#8221; for passage of an immigration bill. He cited as the reason &#8220;huge violence&#8221; at the border and the lack of consensus on the elements of an immigration bill.</p>
<p>Obama initially had promised to take up the issue in his first year in office. He missed the deadline amid an all-out push to enact a healthcare overhaul. Now, Obama is pushing for new regulations for the financial industry, tighter campaign finance laws and a new Supreme Court justice to replace John Paul Stevens, who is retiring.</p>

<p>But I thought Comrade General Secretary Obama, could do everything?</p>

<p>So ends my &ldquo;faith&rdquo; in Marxist Multi Cultism, as a logical and sustainable reality in politics or socioeconomics. More seriously, &ldquo;undocumented migrants&rdquo; (noticed how that imbecilic phrase, has transmuted back into &ldquo;illegal immigrants&rdquo; all of a sudden in the Marxstream Media?) have not a hope in hell once again, for &ldquo;earned citizenship.&rdquo; They are what they are; both racially and sociologically, they are nothing but, alien invaders in this country. </p>
<p>Seems like our &ldquo;savior,&rdquo; is more like a sailor. Or perhaps, simply the usual and expected Communist pirate, the Democrats and other traitors foster and then promote as being &ldquo;needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Either way, reality casts the normal hangover on the intoxicated Red whines of the &ldquo;enlightened,&rdquo; following their &ldquo;triumphs&rdquo; in the morning sunshine and molded &ldquo;government&rdquo; taco cheese party&rsquo;s, huge violence and demented debauchery: </p>

		<p>Finally some of our legislators are beginning to see reason!!!  We in the border states have been &#8220;raped and pillaged&#8221; by the influx of illegal aliens.  Our state treasuries have been bankrupted by the illegals&rsquo; demands on our healthcare, education, and welfare systems.  Arizona has the right idea, and I pray that TX, NM and CA follow AZ&rsquo;s lead.  Yeah, all the Mexicans will squall &#8220;Fascism!!&#8221; - well, let &#8216;em.  They have had far too much time to destroy our states already.  We need to take strong control of our borders and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like it can go back home to Mexico.  We do not need THAT kind of dissent here - we&rsquo;ve put up with it for far too long as it is.</p>

John McCain (R-Ariz.), once a proponent of a sweeping immigration overhaul, released a 10-point plan on Monday that focused exclusively on border security.&#8221; - This is because he is running scared of J. D. Hayworth.  McCain has had decades to do the right thing and has failed miserably.  Arizonan&rsquo;s have a right to be angry, but they hold part of the blame for continuing to re-elect an open borders Senator.</p>

		<p>I do not believe the invasion of America will cease until our political leaders have driven us to a state of Civil War.  Even when we reach the point where we are fighting each other in the streets, our leaders will look around, marvel at how well (they thought) everthing was going, and question how disparate peoples, with historical grudges, having uncommon languages, cultures, ideas and goals, could ever not get along. </p>

		<p>El C - the reason some of our leaders see &#8220;reason&#8221; is because it is a mid cycle election year coming up, McCain is running scared after the last decade of betraying his constituents and promises, Obama isn&rsquo;t going to pi@@ away what little remains of his political capital on a block of voters who, like the blacks, he knows will not swing to the Republicans but will vote Dem no matter what is or isn&rsquo;t done to them.  Obama&rsquo;s FIRST priority is to quickly make of us a Socialist nation and economy before the mid-terms.  They ALL will make moderate or conservative noises until the day after mid-term elections.  Then they ALL will go back to being what they are - pretty much power  hungry elites with arrogant disregard to our wishes or our interests.  Only a broad, clean sweep of the halls of congress have even a hope of saving us.  And only then if we elect conservatives whose record matches their mouth.  Promises are cheap.  Pre election noise is meaningless.  It&rsquo;s the record that counts, and if they have no record, find somebody else.  We can trust NONE of them at this point.  NONE OF THEM.</p>

		<p>I believe Obama AND the Democrats are smart enough to grasp the idea, AMNESTY would be their undoing. That American voters would never forgive that kind of treachery. With the definite possibility of numerous tax hikes including the probability of a VAT (Value Added Tax), the Democrats are already feeling uneasy enough as it is.</p>

		<p>I am amazed that so many can defend the indefensible, yet day after day the invaders and their supporters continue to demand that which isn&rsquo;t theirs. Since we learned of the Arizona bill that would actually enforce immigration laws, the Mexican government has been in an uproar. I can certainly see why. The US has danced to Mexico&rsquo;s tune for so long now, they actually think they can set US immigration policy. I&rsquo;m still waiting for someone with the courage to tell Mexico to go to h  &mdash;  -. Is anyone as tired as I am of hearing how &#8220;important&#8221; the Hispanic vote is? It&rsquo;s been a long time since anyone has voiced concern for American voters. Remember them? The ones who pay the bills, are loyal citizens and VOTE! </p>
