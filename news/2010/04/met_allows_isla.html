			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Leppard, Times of London, April 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SCOTLAND YARD has bowed to Islamic sensitivities and accepted that Muslims are entitled to throw shoes in ritual protest  &mdash;  which could have the unintended consequence of politicians or the police being hit.</p>
<p>News of the concession by the Metropolitan police has come to light amid a series of trials of more than 70 mostly Muslim demonstrators who were charged with violent disorder after last year&rsquo;s Gaza protests outside the Israeli embassy in London.</p>
<p>Aquib Salim, 21, an IT student at Queen Mary, London University, who was involved in a shoe-throwing incident, is almost certain to avoid a prison sentence as a result.</p>
<p>Chris Holt, Salim&rsquo;s solicitor, said he was likely to get a suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to a single charge of throwing a stick at police lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court accepted that the earlier shoe-throwing incident was simply a ritual form of protest and therefore not a criminal act of violence,&#8221; Holt said.</p>
<p>Judge Denniss agreed that the act of shoe-throwing should not be considered in a charge of violent disorder against the student because it was &#8220;a symbolic&#8221; political gesture.</p>
<p>Shoes, and particularly the soles of shoes, are regarded as ritually unclean in the Islamic world. An Iraqi journalist became a folk hero for throwing a shoe at President George W Bush during a press conference in December 2008.</p>
<p>The president ducked, but Muntadhar al-Zaidi was jailed for three years and allegedly tortured by the Iraqis. He was released after nine months and his gesture inspired many imitators.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service admitted this weekend that the police advice to the Downing Street protesters was a factor in the case at Isleworth crown court, west London.</p>
<p>It has now emerged that the Metropolitan police first told protesters of its stance on shoe-throwing shortly after the attack on Bush.</p>
<p>The concession has already been taken up enthusiastically by Muslim demonstrators, who pelted Downing Street with shoes in protest at the Israeli bombing of Gaza last year.</p>
<p>Dozens of ski-boots and clogs were also hurled at the US consulate in Edinburgh in a related protest, in which three policemen sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>Lindsey German, convenor of the Stop the War coalition, said: &#8220;After the incident in Baghdad we told the police that people would want to bring shoes to throw at Downing Street.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said that was okay and there was a facility allowed for people to bring old pairs of shoes. Afterwards they joked that they didn&rsquo;t realise we were going to throw the shoes so hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>In January 2009, anti-war protesters advertised a demonstration outside Downing Street by posting a photograph of a pair of old shoes under the words: &#8220;Bring your old shoes to throw at useless Gordo.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I think the real story here is that the government wanted to send people to prison for throwing shoes at the Israeli embassy.  The charges against the protesters in this case were wildly disproportionate and obviously politically motivated.  The court has only ruled that Israel does not get special rights in the UK.  There is nothing about not giving a foreign country special rights that is against British interests.  </p>

<p>Seriously, we see one more symptom of how Western countries are bowing down before their new Islamic overlords. </p>
<p>Of course, if a native born Englishman were to display a flag with the Cross of St. George, he would be declared a hate criminal.<br>

		<p>After so many years in the muslim world, I am pretty darn familiar with the Arab muslim customs and such&hellip;I can tell you that there is no such thing as &#8220;ritual&#8221; shoe throwing as the Iraqi who threw a shoe at Bush knows. Muslims only get away with that sort of stuff in Western PC countries as you will NEVER EVER see it in Saudi or Kuwait.</p>

<p>The &#8216;revolution&rsquo; has become normalized. Even mandatory. </p>
<p>It works in both directions too. While &#8216;expressions&rsquo; of the &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; are given unquestioned validity, it&rsquo;s now a &#8216;disgrace&rsquo; to draw a cartoon of Obama or draw an effigy. </p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Judge Denniss agreed that the act of shoe-throwing should not be considered in a charge of violent disorder against the student because it was &ldquo;a symbolic&rdquo; political gesture.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><br>
I suggest to this judge that he stand amongst the police while rabid Muslims and radicals hurl heavy shoes, ski-boots and Birkenstocks at his head, as hard as they can, for the entire duration of one of these protest. After Judge Denniss has been struck in the head and body with enough of these heavy objects, he will be asked if he still feels that shoe-throwing is not &#8220;violent&#8221; but merely &ldquo;a symbolic political gesture.&rdquo;<br>
But don&rsquo;t worry, Judge: we&rsquo;ll provide bandages and first-aid for any &#8220;symbolic&#8221; cuts, bruises and abrasions you might suffer during the footwear onslaught. </p>
<p>The only thing &#8220;symbolic&#8221; going on here is that Judge&rsquo;s ruling is symbolic of the surrender-monkey mentality of the suicidal British ruling class. It symbolizes the end of Britain as a sovereign white Christian nation of laws. <br>

		<p>Does pepper-spraying a shoe-thrower and then beating the daylights out of him after he is down and incapacitated also count as a symbolic gesture?  If so, then I&rsquo;m all for it!  The &#8220;symbolism&#8221; inherent in a well-deserved and really thorough whupping is an amazing and glorious thing.</p>

		<p>The irony is that throwing shoes is far more offensive to Muslims than to Westerners.  Shoes, as was noted, are ritually unclean in Islam.  Showing the sole of your shoe in a Muslim country is equivalent to mooning.  So you can imagine what throwing shoes would be.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a great commercial opportunity here.  One could establish a foundry casting six-pound iron shoes, which could be thrown at members of the Labor Party. </p>

		<p>Will throwing feces at the pols who pander to Fourth-World invaders be allowed?  It&rsquo;s a symbolic, ritual form of protest, too.  Feces is probably too good for them, but it&rsquo;s at least free.</p>
