<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/sports/12sickle.html">In N.C.A.A., Question of Bias Over a Test for a Genetic Trait</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katie Thomas and Brett Zarda, New York Times, April 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Twenty-one college football players have collapsed and died as a result of training over the past decade. At least eight were carriers of the sickle-cell trait, a genetic disorder that can unpredictably turn deadly during rigorous exercise.</p>
<p>A blood test to screen for the trait costs about $5, and many university team doctors and athletic trainers support compulsory testing, arguing that it could save lives.</p>
<p>Yet a proposal to make such testing mandatory for all N.C.A.A. Division I athletes is not a sure bet to pass when it comes up for a vote by member conferences as early as Monday in Indianapolis.</p>
<p>The measure is questioned by the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, which argues that athletes should know their own status but raises concerns that those with the trait could be denied the chance to compete. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People with sickle-cell trait have one abnormal hemoglobin gene and typically lead normal lives  &mdash;  many do not even know they are carriers. The trait is found in about 8 percent of African-Americans, but in less than 1 percent of white Americans. Those with two mutated genes are said to have sickle-cell disease, which can cause a lifetime of health problems like severe pain, anemia, stroke and damage to tissue and organs.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Colleges reluctant to test athletes for sickle-cell gene.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the deterioration of society continues in full swing.  The road sign is telling us there&rsquo;s a cliff just ahead. <br>

		<p>This reminds me of the stupidity that reigned so long over the testing for the HIV virus.  People wanted to bury their heads in the sand and pretend it didn&rsquo;t exist.  I guess some people are still like that, but thank God the HIV test has become quite mainstream in this day and age.  So what&rsquo;s the big deal with sickle cell?  Test ALL the athletes already!  If you test the whites as well as blacks, the blacks can&rsquo;t squall about racism.  I knew a family whose eldest son (Asian father, black mother) had sickle cell disease - that boy suffered terribly and there really wasn&rsquo;t much the docs could do to help him.  Maybe if athletes get tested, it&rsquo;ll give more publicity to the disease, and more research will be devoted to it.  One can hope!</p>

		<p>Genetically the different races are very different.  That is why they can determine the race of a criminal from just a hair follicle.  </p>
<p>Sickle-cell is just one of thousands of ways that Africans differ genetically from other races.  This is exactly similar to what evolutionary biologists have discovered whenever they study populations that have been separated for millions of years   &mdash;   they always evolve genetic and physical differences.</p>

<p>Indians have sicke cell too. It&rsquo;s a recessive trait that anyone can inherit perfectly if their parent is a carrier.</p>

		<p>Sickle-cell anemia affects many African-Americans.  That is why I whole-heartedly support it.  Er, I meant RESEARCH into it.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

		<p>El Cerotito: You wrote &#8220;I knew a family whose eldest son (Asian father, black mother) had sickle cell disease - that boy suffered terribly&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sickle cell is a recessive gene, and Asians don&rsquo;t carry it. So if the boy had sickle cell DISEASE (and not just sickle cell TRAIT) then his Asian &#8220;father&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t really his father.</p>
<p>In Louisiana, every child born to a black mother is tested for sickle cell trait. (I used to work in the lab that does the testing.) We had to do a LOT of &#8220;genetic counseling&#8221; for couples when the test showed that the daddy wasn&rsquo;t really the daddy.<br>
