<h1>Kindergarten Teacher: Woods Lied About School Race Incident</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New York Post, April 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tiger Woods&rsquo; a former kindergarten teacher disputed a story today that he once told about an incident where he was tied to a tree and spray painted with the N-word by older kids.</p>
<p>In a 2005 book written by Charles Barkley, Woods said he was taunted at a young age by schoolmates because he was bi-racial.</p>
<p>The teacher, Maureen Decker, said the story is a complete lie and that she&rsquo;s been unfairly maligned.</p>
<p>Decker, who has hired lawyer Gloria Allred, wants a retraction and an apology.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was shocked, saddened and disappointed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by his false accusations of racial abuse,&#8221; she told reporters during a news conference in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the book, the story Tiger told includes the tale of when he was beaten down in the playground by a group of racist white kids.</p>
<p>&#8220;I became aware of my racial identity on my first day of school, on my first day of kindergarten. A group of sixth graders tied me to a tree, spray-painted the word &#8216;n  &mdash;    &mdash;  &rsquo; on me, and threw rocks at me. That was my first day of school. And the teacher really didn&rsquo;t do much of anything,&#8221; according to the book.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Decker, who is also mentioned in a video about Tiger&rsquo;s life, said she&rsquo;s not looking for any money from Woods.</p>
<p>The retired teacher also said there was no way older students could ever enter the area where the kindergarten kids played.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition, the former principal of the Cerritos Elementary School, in Cypress, Calif., where Tiger attended, said he has no knowledge of the incident.</p>
<p>A parent, Linda DaViega, who was always around the school at that time period, also said she has never heard of such an incident happening.<br>

		<p>Fabricating claims of bigotry:<br>
	<br>
Blacks need to stir the racial cauldron to prove white supremacists still exist; so when their race baiting fails to produce the desired result they grow increasingly frustrated and resort to falsifying claims bigotry and hate to gain sympathy for their cause; Tiger probably thought he could add a little excitement to his book with his cock-and-bull story. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this happen too many times when it involves telling the truth or spinning a &#8220;tall tale&#8221;. During my many years in the military as I investigated this sort of problem it would usually wind up, after interviewing all concerned, that the minority member not only fabricated what happened but added a racial tinge to try and get the higher ups in the chain of command to only hear the racial aspect of the incident even if it was 100% false.  Years ago lies like this would be thought to be false but in todays AA society if it&rsquo;s spoken it must be true.  Something in the genes and lack of upbringing has to be the partial answer. Disgusting.</p>

		<p>This story reminds me of the time dear old Dad caught a  Clinton era high government official, before the media did, who lied about being torpedoed then rescued while on convoy duty. My old man said, &#8220;A convoy doesn`t slow when it sees men in the water, it pours on coal!!&#8221;<br>
  In Woods case, I see he was born in 1975. That would make his first year of kintergarten in say, 1981. If teachers were busy instilling &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; in my own childhood 1966-70, then you can bet there was none of this foolishness going on 15 years later. <br>
  Also Sixth graders know damn well the penalty for attacking or demeaning first graders. Their preferred prey would be in the fourth grade to fifth grade range. A six year old boy is not even on the radar screen for a twelve year old. The whole story smells from the git-go!!</p>

		<p>Even when they&rsquo;re millionaires many times over they still want to be thought of as victims.</p>
<p>I wonder if this guy realizes that he puts himself down terribly by claiming to have been assaulted because of his race?  It means he has always been thought of as inferior. Being able to play golf has nothing to do with anything else.</p>

		<p>Fifty years ago, adults often spun &#8220;the heroic child&#8221; stories when they reflected upon their own youthful years. No more. Now it is &#8220;the victimized child&#8221; who rules these recollections. </p>
<p>If one is black and famous, it is almost a requirement that a biography include an example of persecution by evil white racists.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods is a master of bending the truth as well as playing golf and it becomes more obvious every day that he got his start at being proficient at both early in his life.<br>

		<p>Singer Patti Labelle wrote similar things in her autobiography. About performing in the segregated south and meeting white men who had unkind things to say to the members of the girl group at this or that bar/take out restaurant. It almost seemed though the locals were Really telling them not to date white guys. One thing about All the stories seems to be &#8216;racism&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re not authentically black unless you&rsquo;re a victim and have risen above it. The funny thing about about the stories is, like the &#8216;Jenna 6&rsquo; the claims of &#8216;racism&rsquo; go on up until today&hellip; One day I think the lid will no longer be able to be held over it, and we&rsquo;ll be forced to acknowledge most &#8216;racism&rsquo; is really being directed at whites. Then I suppose there will have to be disclaimers every that &#8216;non-whites are victims of racism too&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Is Woods&rsquo; story not immediately identifiable by any racially aware white person as compete nonsense on its face? His tale reads like something out of a Hollywood race-fantasy(you know how they love those) set in the deep South in say, 1935 or so!! </p>
<p>This shows how brainwashed Americans really are. This story was utterly unbelievable from the start - but no one questioned it&hellip;no one DARED question it! Indeed, the only reason we know of it now is because this teacher, no doubt, is most horrified by the allegation that she was &#8220;racially insensitive&#8221; to poor Tiger&rsquo;s plight!</p>

If you believe that, you&rsquo;d probably believe that all those women fancied our hero Tiger for his looks and personality instead of what&rsquo;s in his wallet.</p>
<p>Not just a garden variety slur for our hero, but a triumverate of atrocities; tied to a tree, spraypainted with the N-word and to top it all off, rocks hurled at him. I bet those kids all had blondish hair, check shirts and their Dads looked like Richie Cunningham!</p>

		<p>Obviously the God of Golf is no stranger to lying. But this teacher wants a piece of the pie, as well. Hiring Gloria Allred? For what??? Get real. This is no &#8216;anyonymous&rsquo; act. Gloria&rsquo;s about as high profile as the late Johnny Cochran. Greed from anyone makes me sick.</p>

		<p>Yes, Tiger Woods invented this unbelievable tale but it is also the responsibility of the author, the editor and publisher to run a fact check before a &#8220;biography&#8221;, which, by definition, is a true account of someone&rsquo;s life, is published. Is this &#8220;author&#8221;, Charles Barkley, the black basketball player and ESPN announcer? This story, apparantly, has been very easy to disprove and could have been done before the fact, otherwise, a disclaimer should have been printed at the beginning of the text that stating that anecdotes may be embellished or made up or something to that effect or else should have been published as fiction. Editors employ factcheckers for this very reason. Didn&rsquo;t anybody learn anything from the James Frey/Oprah Winfrey debacle? <br>
I see a bigger story here than just this spoiled, adulterous, black athelete caught in more lies. I see a conspiracy, once again, to exploit white guilt to pity the poor, abused black child, to elevate him to a hero for enduring this terrible racist abuse at the hands of evil white children and evil, racist school administrators who did nothing to protect the innocent suffering and to promote these ridiculous accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; where none existed. <br>
Tiger Woods is guilty of inventing these incidents, certainly, but his reason for doing so was apparantly self serving. The author, Charles Barkley, and even more so, the editor and the publisher were guilty for more calculating and insidious reasons.<br>
Sure. Laugh and tell me to put on my tinfoil hat but make no mistakes about this, folks. There is a very carefully calculated brainwashing campaign underway and if we want to escape it we must avoid pretty much everything unless it comes from the mind and mouth of a trusted, independent thinker.</p>

		<p>So he claims he was the target of white bigotry when he was in school, so then when he grows up he marries a white woman. That makes alot of sense. And I believe Barkley is also married to a white woman. Funny how so many blacks scream they are victims of white racism and then want to marry into the white race.</p>

That is what I thought too. Just think it in the logical way: six graders have Spraycans at school? At that time? And they had a coil of rope? Why?</p>
<p>Then they went in their break into the Kindergarten? Nobody saw it? Then they looked for a black, put him on a tree? He was probably crying -nobody heard him- IN A KINDERGARTEN? They sprayed at him? They throw stones at him? That would take a very lot of time, when was it? In the 5 minutes break? Nobody helped him? The teacher could be sued for not helping but I should suggest they were so evil racists, they just go for the risk.</p>
<p>Really the first thing I thought was: Is this from Hollywood? It looks like a typical Hollywood fantasy of some director who want to get famous for his PC views while he sends his kids to white-only schools.</p>

		<p>Hmmm&hellip; I guess it takes Sherlock Holmes to figure out this bogus story.  Not like I had ANY respect for him to begin with, But if I had it would all be gone.  His words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I became aware of my racial identity on my first day of school, on my first day of kindergarten. A group of sixth graders tied me to a tree, spray-painted the word &lsquo;n &mdash;  &mdash; &rsquo; on me, and threw rocks at me. That was my first day of school.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Tiger, on your FIRST day of school, sixth graders, who had no idea you would be there, (first day of kindergarten) brought spray paint to school to humiliate you?  Did they anticipate you being there somehow?  Were they as sixth graders so racist that they premeditated spray painting somebody?  Who in the heck as a sixth grader brings spray paint, let alone ROPE to school on THEIR FIRST DAY?  It would never happen and it did not happen.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods is a pathetic liar.  Anyone who believes anything this billionaire victim says is even more pathetic. </p>
