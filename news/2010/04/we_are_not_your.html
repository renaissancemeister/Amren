<h1>We Are Not Your Weapons  &mdash;  We Are Women</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Kijera, Alternet, April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two weeks ago, on a Monday morning, I started to write what I thought was a very clever editorial about violence against women in Haiti. The case, I believed, was being overstated by women&rsquo;s organizations in need of additional resources. Ever committed to preserving the dignity of Black men in a world which constantly stereotypes them as violent savages, I viewed this writing as yet one more opportunity to fight &#8220;the man&#8221; on behalf of my brothers. That night, before I could finish the piece, I was held on a rooftop in Haiti and raped repeatedly by one of the very men who I had spent the bulk of my life advocating for.</p>
<p>It hurt. The experience was almost more than I could bear. I begged him to stop. Afraid he would kill me, I pleaded with him to honor my commitment to Haiti, to him as a brother in the mutual struggle for an end to our common oppression, but to no avail. He didn&rsquo;t care that I was a Malcolm X scholar. He told me to shut up, and then slapped me in the face. Overpowered, I gave up fighting halfway through the night.</p>
<p>Accepting the helplessness of my situation, I chucked aside the Haiti bracelet I had worn so proudly for over a year, along with it, my dreams of human liberation. Someone, I told myself, would always be bigger and stronger than me. As a woman, my place in life had been ascribed from birth. A Chinese proverb says that &#8220;women are like the grass, meant to be stepped on.&#8221; The thought comforted me at the same time that it made me cringe.</p>
<p>A dangerous thought. Others like it have derailed movements, discouraged consciousness and retarded progress for centuries. To accept it as truth signals the beginning of the end of a person  &mdash;  or community&rsquo;s  &mdash;  life and ability to self-love. Resignation means inertia, and for the past two weeks I have inhabited its innards. My neighbors here include women from all over the world, but it&rsquo;s the women of African descent, and particularly Haitian women, who move me to write now.</p>
<p>Truly, I have witnessed as a journalist and human rights advocate the many injustices inflicted upon Black men in this world. The pain, trauma and rage born of exploitation are terrors that I have grappled with every day of my life. They make one want to strike back, to fight rabidly for what is left of their personal dignity in the wake of such things. Black men have every right to the anger they feel in response to their position in the global hierarchy, but their anger is misdirected.</p>
<p>Women are not the source of their oppression; oppressive policies and the as-yet unaddressed white patriarchy which still dominates the global stage are. Because women  &mdash;  and particularly women of color  &mdash;  are forced to bear the brunt of the Black male response to the Black male plight, the international community and those nations who have benefitted from the oppression of colonized peoples have a responsibility to provide women with the protection that they need.</p>
<p>The United Nations, western women&rsquo;s organizations and the Haitian government must immediately provide women in Haiti with the funding that they need to build domestic violence and rape crisis centers. Stop dividing Black families by distributing solely to women, which only exaggerates male resentment and frustration in Haiti. Provide both women and men with job training programs that would allow for self-sufficiency as opposed to continued dependency on whites. Lastly, admit that the issue of racial integration might still need addressing on an international level, and then find a way to address it!</p>
<p>I went to Haiti after the earthquake to empower Haitians to self-sufficiency. I went to remind them of the many great contributions that Afro-descendants have made to this world, and of their amazing resilience and strength as a people. Not once did I envision myself becoming a receptacle for a Black man&rsquo;s rage at the white world, but that is what I became. While I take issue with my brother&rsquo;s behavior, I&rsquo;m grateful for the experience. It woke me up, made me understand on a deeper level the terror that my sisters deal with daily. This in hand, I feel comfortable in speaking for Haitian women, and for myself, in saying that we will not be your pawns, racially, politically, economically or otherwise.</p>
<p>We are women, not weapons of war. Thankfully, there are organizations here in Haiti who continues to fight for women&rsquo;s human rights like, MADRE, SOFA and Enfofanm.</p>
<p>Rather than allowing myself to be used in such a fashion, and as opposed to submitting to the frustration and bitterness that can be born of such an experience, I choose to continue to love and educate instead. My brothers can be sensitized to women&rsquo;s realities in Haiti and the world over if these are presented to them by using their own clashes with racism and oppression as a starting point.</p>
<p>They must be made to understand the dangerous likelihood of the oppressed becoming the oppressor if no shift in consciousnesses takes place and if no end to the cycle of trauma occurs. I intend to see that it does&hellip;by continuing to live and work fearlessly with justice in mind, through the creation of a safe space for women in Haiti and by creating programming for Haitian men that considers their needs, too. Weapons annihilate, dialogue bears fruit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fruit I&rsquo;m interested in now, no matter how strange or bruised it might appear.<br>

		<p> A typical White-liberal screed, this time coming from one in a black skin. The thug who raped her is not to blame   &mdash;   oh, no, heaven forbid! White people are to blame, the &#8220;still-unaddressed White patriarchy&#8221; is to blame, the &#8220;plight of the black man&#8221; is to blame.</p>
<p> They say that a convert to conservatism is often a liberal who has just been mugged. In this case, a brutal rape merely reinforced all the pre-conceived notions about the world that this &#8220;Malcolm X scholar&#8221; already held. Some people never learn   &mdash;   because they don&rsquo;t WANT to learn. </p>

		<p>Someone should inform the ignorant woman that Haiti has been a 100% black country since they drove out/slaughtered all of the white inhabitants in the 18th century.</p>
<p>There is no &#8216;white patriarchy&rsquo; there to oppress ANYONE.</p>
<p>And, that aside, he probably raped her because he wanted to have sex with her. I doubt he had a year-long philosophic dialogue with himself over matters of race and oppression before choosing to do such a thing.<br>

She&rsquo;s offended that black men are &#8216;stereotyped&rsquo; as violent and then surprised when she learns, first hand, they are.</p>
<p>Who does she blame? The &#8216;oppressor&rsquo;, the white man.</p>
<p>This woman makes two direct points. First she believes women (of all color) are oppressed by men. Second, she see white men as the ultimate oppressor (which is why she feels solidarity with black men; both women and black men are the ultimate victims of white men).</p>
<p>For her, being raped by a black man isn&rsquo;t the issue. The issue is white oppression. &#8216;A black man raped me because white men are evil&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Even after the rape, she wants to redouble her efforts to reach out to black men to teach them that the reason they rape is because white men are evil. She seems to believe that once black men understand how truly evil white men are, they will stop committing rape and overthrow the white male oppressor.</p>
<p>How do you explain this? How do you break through the insane logic of an insane mind?</p>
<p>My definition of liberalism: a form a mental illness characterized by an inability to see reality.</p>

		<p>Grateful for the experience&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Another true believer, another leftist loon who fails to understand that all the Malcolm X scholarship and do-gooder jet-setting around the Third World to help her &#8220;brothers and sisters&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that she&rsquo;s still the &#8220;white devil&#8221; and is still going to be treated accordingly.  </p>
<p>Her solution seems to be that black men should stop raping women and turn their &#8220;misdirected&#8221; anger against the white man.  I&rsquo;d like to see them actually get up the nerve to try.  Sometimes I think they forget they&rsquo;re only 13% of the population.  </p>

		<p>A horrible crime; followed by it is still whitey&rsquo;s fault. When will people like this finally realized that adults of any race or color are responsible for the choices they make in life.  This male knew and still knows that rape is a violent assault against a person. To say his rage is due to relief groups giving aid to women and not men is to excuse his choices. He is now given a free pass by this woman to do it again. Will she still blame whitey and relief groups when this &#8220;man&#8221; rapes a 11 year-old girl?<br>
The real answer to his crime: find him try him and if fould gulity, punish him. My idea is to just shoot or hang him. He will never do anything like this again. </p>

		<p>She must have been more traumatized from the rape than she realized because she forgot to curse her own mother for the hate crime against human dignity for even making this here White Woman who was once a White Baby.</p>
<p>All White babies are racists. Don&rsquo;t make one. If you must, be sure to teach it to blame all black on White violence on anything but violent blacks.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a couple of other websites where there are now lengthy threads on this woman, and there is nothing that is really firmly established about her.</p>
<p>For instance, her white appearance belies her claims to be a Malcolm X Scholar of &#8220;Exceptional Courage&#8221; because Malcolm X Scholar funds are only given to African Americans, but she can&rsquo;t really be discounted as some sort of &#8220;high-yellow&#8221; black.</p>
<p>She wrote a novel called &#8220;White Girl&#8221; but it is admittedly just a novel.</p>
<p>She speaks positively of her rape, and yet women who know women who&rsquo;ve been raped say that raped women never say such things. Indeed, we have only her word for it that she was raped or even that she went to Haiti at all.</p>
<p>In the end, the only thing that is really clear about her is that she is rabidly anti-white.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m grateful for the experience,&#8221; she says.  What further proof do we need that there is a segment of whites who have been brainwashed by &#8220;educators&#8221; (she is a Malcolm X scholar) to the point of psychosis.  No doubt, if she remains in Haiti, she will have the opportunity to be grateful for many more such experiences.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I went to Haiti after the earthquake to empower Haitians to self-sufficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency from what, you fool?  There are virtually no other ethnic groups living in Haiti!</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to remind them of the many great contributions that Afro-descendants have made to this world&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Like what?  Name one.  I can&rsquo;t think of any.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;and of their amazing resilience and strength as a people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surely you jest.  The earthquake in Haiti demonstrated yet again to the entire world, whenever something chaotic happens to black communities, blacks there quickly degenerate into savagery.  Some &#8220;resilience and strength&#8221;!</p>
<p>&#8220;Not once did I envision myself becoming a receptacle for a Black man&rsquo;s rage at the white world, but that is what I became. While I take issue with my brother&rsquo;s behavior, I&rsquo;m grateful for the experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>That statement better than any other clearly illustrates the dangers of Marxist indoctrination of White students in our schools.  This woman was inculcated to be docile and a glutton for punishment.  She is lost to the Race and useless to us!  Let her live among her black &#8220;brothers&#8221;; if they&rsquo;ll let her.  She&rsquo;s nothing but another Amy Biehl.</p>

		<p>The author has little confidence in black men.</p>
<p>In an all-African country, self-ruled by blacks for over one hundred years, she believes the &#8220;international community&#8221; should be responsible for giving black women the same standards of civilization that white men built on behalf of white women.</p>
<p>She decries black dependancy on whites, but then asks for more of it.</p>

<p>So you say, Comrade Kijera!</p>
<p>But I wonder, is that really the case here?</p>
<p>Nope, I don&rsquo;t think it is; not in the least!</p>
<p>Personally, I think you are a freakishly treasonous and racially masochistic harlot, who got everything she really wants out of her sexual tourism, masked as being a &ldquo;humanitarian&rdquo; socialist worker&rsquo;s enterprise. I think you probably offered yourself to your &ldquo;rapist&rdquo; and then resisted, simply to elicit every: threatening grunt, brutal slap, and many other sexual dominations, that feed your perversely needy anti-white lusts. Why else would you enter a disaster zone where multiple rapes have occurred against black women, and then so romantically rhapsodize about &ldquo;a Black man&rsquo;s rage&rdquo; in doing the &ldquo;same&rdquo; to you?</p>
<p>I guess you might, if you think that makes you &ldquo;special;&rdquo; however, it doesn&rsquo;t, not at all.</p>
<p>What it does, is reinforce the fact that you secretly do see blacks as inferior and inept enough to degrade your &ldquo;white privileges&rdquo; sexually and provide you with a rapturous &ldquo;rape&rdquo; fantasy fulfilled!!!</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you book your next &ldquo;mercy mission,&rdquo; in some Taliban camp?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how black countries like Haiti and Rhodesia(whoops, that would be Zimbabwe now) continue to blame whites for all their problems, despite the fact that they butchered every white man, woman, and child in their respective countries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bet money that if whites ever disappear from the world entirely, they&rsquo;d blame &#8220;the enduring legacy of the evil whites&#8221; for their problems.</p>
<p>As for this woman, she&rsquo;s obviously a few pastries short of a baker&rsquo;s dozen, if you catch my drift.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That night, before I could finish the piece, I was held on a rooftop in Haiti and raped repeatedly by one of the very men who I had spent the bulk of my life advocating for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her biggest mistake and one she continues to make is in claiming black men are treated unjustly.  But where is this unjust treatment she speaks of.  How are they treated &#8220;unjustly?&#8221; Where does it occur?</p>
<p>Jeremiah Wright also speaks of the outrageous injustices against black men, and his congregants gleefully cheer and applaud.</p>
<p>Agein I ask, what are these poor, loony fools talking about?  I mean the only reasons black males can&rsquo;t succeed in society has nothing to do with oppression, unjust treatment or racism.  In fact black males are treated as privileged characters of all the empire&rsquo;s subjects.  Alleged black injustice has absolutely nothing to do with injustice in reality, unless it is the preferences they get in almost every segment of society from schooling to jobs.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is that black male failure has everything to do with their inability and lack of intelligence.</p>
<p>This poor fool who was raped is not only misguided she&rsquo;s someone who has been brainwashed to the point where she is unable to reason objectively and has been indoctrinated to hate herself.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s one of the most pitiful human beings I&rsquo;ve ever read about and probably more deserving of what she&rsquo;s been subjected to than any victim so far, and with 37,500 average black on white rapes in a given year that&rsquo;s a lot of victims.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While I take issue with my brother&rsquo;s behavior, I&rsquo;m grateful for the experience</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I feel truly sorry for the white race. What type of woman would refer to her rapist as a &#8220;brother&#8221;? This type of madness is limited to white people, and no other race displays this sort of sickness.</p>
<p>The often quoted DOJ reports, say that over 30,000 white women are raped by black men every year. Those are just REPORTED rapes. The rape of white women by blacks has become so common, that nobody sees it as a great deal any more. How can white men claim to be real men, if they cannot protect their women? Men of all other races, would never tolerate the mass rape of their women, by men of other races. White men cannot even protect themselves in prison from rape by black thugs, so, how can they protect their women? Have whites unconsciously offered themselves as sacrifices to blacks, in order to atone for past sins to blacks? This is crazy!</p>
<p>In the Old American South, before 1960, white men would never have tolerated that sort of behavior by blacks. The pre-1960 behavior by the men of the South, is what the rest of the world considers to be &#8220;normal&#8221;. How do you think men in China, India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Japan, Mexico, and elsewhere, would react, if 30,000 of their women were raped by blacks? The potential reaction of those oriental men, would make pre-1960 white Southerners look like Mahatma Gandhis. </p>
<p>I do not think that Russians and other whites from Eastern Europe, can tolerate that sort of black behavior either. The lady is justified in her hatred for white American men, but for different reasons than the ones she describes.</p>

		<p>Judging from this woman&rsquo;s political views, it would be plausible to ascertain that she is a feminist. Very ironically, she is also a masochist, particularly a masochist to black men. Notice how she always capitalizes &#8220;black,&#8221; which is improper? She ought to have good knowledge of the English language, since she&rsquo;s a journalist and writer, so there&rsquo;s no excuse for not knowing that it&rsquo;s improper to capitalize &#8220;black.&#8221; Basically, her capitalizing &#8220;black&#8221; is another sign of racial masochism.</p>
<p>What went through my head when I finished reading this ridiculous article was, My God - why is this woman, who clearly has something wrong in her head, not in some sort of mental institution? A woman gets raped by someone she is trying to help &mdash; and who does she blame? None other than her own race for its invisible &#8220;oppression&#8221; of black people.</p>
<p>People with her mindset truly have a mental disorder.</p>

		<p>How can anyone from a black-run country that has been in existence for over two centuries claim a continued &#8220;dependency on whites&#8221; and still complain about it?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, this black woman isn&rsquo;t Haitian.  She&rsquo;s undoubtedly from some CIVILIZED country built on Euro-centrism.<br>
 <br>
And how, exactly, can her rape by a black man from black-run, independent Haiti be attributed to his &#8220;rage at the white world&#8221;?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, black people blame all sorts of misbehavior on their being victims of an oppressive white world.  </p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll concede that &#8220;the issue of racial integration might still need addressing on an international level,&#8221;  but I submit that the only workable solution has already been tried, and co-existence with blacks, except on the terms of &#8220;apartheid,&#8221; just doesn&rsquo;t seem worth the trouble.  </p>

<p>How or why could a black Haitian male that was raised in Haiti, the epitome of Black on Black dysfunction, blame or &#8220;rage against&#8221; anyone but the blacks within his own nation that are the cause of it&rsquo;s problems.</p>

		<p>Wow this is amazing even by Amren standards! She really thought that the appropriate response when being attacked by an frenzied black rapist was to prattle some liberal gibberish about global oppression and the black struggle(!) </p>
<p>Like the black gentlemen is going to stop raping her, pull up her pants and offer an apology when she tells him she is his sista in the struggle against white global patriarchy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop dividing Black families by distributing solely to women, which only exaggerates male resentment and frustration in Haiti.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ha ha ok. Wasn&rsquo;t there abundant news footage showing what happens when you do this? The black males push aside the women, trample the children, attack the aid workers then sell the food for sex. </p>
<p>&#8220;Provide both women and men with job training programs that would allow for self-sufficiency as opposed to continued dependency on whites. &#8220;</p>
<p>JOB TRAINING CENTERS?!? For what jobs(!)? Pie bakers? Rape counselors? Aside from subsistence farming, or government kleptocrat the main &#8220;job&#8221; in Haiti is called lining up at the relief center for a hand out. It requires very little training.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lastly, admit that the issue of racial integration might still need addressing on an international level, and then find a way to address it!&#8221;</p>
<p>What on earth does that mean? Does the UN General Assembly do anything at all BESIDES whine about white racism? Isn&rsquo;t Obama already King of the World?  </p>

So now we&rsquo;re guilty of committing crimes we didn&rsquo;t commit, against someone we&rsquo;ve never met, and which occurred in another Nation.  She makes the perfect case for a total separation of the races, in that in a multi-racial environment, there will always be some White person who is at a station &#8220;above&#8221; some Black person, and thus causing (in their view) some form of oppression.  It will never end - the anti-White mindset will never change. </p>

		<p>Here is a white woman full of Christian style ethics.  She has the resilience of a &#8220;true believer,&#8221; who can never grasp the emptiness, the absolute myth of her belief.  To realize that she has simpy been brutalized by a brute from a brutal race, and the reality of the meaninglessness of her work, is impossible.  Since she has so much invested, she rather decides that she is grateful for being raped, brutally, all night.</p>
<p>The truth is that this woman and women, people like her are meglomaniacs.  She wants to have the godlike power over these brutal people.  She needs to prove that her beliefs are more powerful than the oppressors, who she has created in her myth as consistently white, and male.  But she is gambling with her life, which I suppose must have seemed a bit boring before she went into her savior work and now her &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; as a white rape opject for angry black men to vent upon.  There is an entire underworld of perverted souls who find a common ground in torture; one loves to play the torturer and the other loves to play the victim.  Sado/masochism is what is being played out in this woman&rsquo;s life.  And how many others?  Millions likely, to one degree or another.  I see these dumb white females everywhere, and there are always men who can smell the phermones of victimhood from a great distance.  Whatever intelligence they have is being countered by their addiction to virtue and CHRISTIAN values of self-sacrifice, giving til you bleed, even die.</p>
<p>Some will likely rage at me for writing that, but I nonetheless charge it to be true.  You don&rsquo;t have to have a PhD in psychology and theology to see it.  Whites must dump this suicidal culture and find a more supportive one - if they must have one.</p>
<p>But she can also simply be called &#8220;hard headed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is likely that her rapist friend, and some of his friends will only take her acceptance of her &#8220;brother&rsquo;s&#8221; hehaviors as an invitation for more free sex with a more passive white woman.  She may realize her mistake at the point of death. </p>

		<p>I read this article with amazement.  This black woman, raped by a black Haitian man, STILL blames the whole thing on white people.  It&rsquo;s no wonder blacks are at the bottom of the world totem pole, with that kind of intelligence.  This woman is still looking outside herself for others to blame as her &#8220;oppressors,&#8221; when in fact she has met the enemy and it is she herself.  Black people have GOT to climb out of the victimhood hole and start taking responsibility for their every thought, word and act plus for every result therefrom.  THAT is true equality - that&rsquo;s what everybody else has to do, like it or not.  Blacks are NOT exceptions to that universal law; they just imagine that they are, with the help of charlatans like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.  This woman was brain damaged long before the rape; unfortunately it&rsquo;s people like her who are going to keep blacks in poverty and ignorance until they have a major change of consciousness, wake up, and grow up.</p>

		<p> Is this woman white? If so, what a screwed up excuse for a human being.Moronic scribblings like this only serve to reveal the depths our educational systems have sunk. It appears she is repeating all of the Liberal mumbo-jumbo that was crammed into the poor things brain in some hard left college, short circuiting the will to live. Whew,this is getting scary!</p>

		<p>I am sure this will be a heavily commented article and most remarks will be about how deluded this woman is.</p>
<p>However, my question is: did this really happen?  The article is short on what happened.</p>
<p>Why was she on a rooftop?</p>
<p>Who was the man and why was he on the rooftop too?</p>
<p>Did she report it?  If so, to who?</p>
<p>Did no one help her since it apparently lasted for several hours (throughout the night)?</p>
<p>Did she seek medical help?  If so, what was her experience?</p>
<p>Surely she will need anti-HIV medication if the rapist did not use a condom (unlikely). </p>
<p>All of these details would make the story more realistic and also demonstrate how bad white &#8220;oppression&#8221; is (e.g. hospitals with no help for rape victims due to Amerikan imperialism, etc).</p>
<p>The very vague information suggests to me this may well be a hoax.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I went to Haiti after the earthquake to empower Haitians to self-sufficiency.&#8221; </p>
<p>The self-aggrandization of that liberal super-heroine is just unbelievable. Someone who is utterly powerless when it comes to dealing with the rapacious behavior of just one single black man feels capable of empowering the citizens of a whole (black)country.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;I went to remind them of the many great contributions that Afro-descendants have made to this world, and of their amazing resilience and strength as a people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is she referring to peanut-butter and gang culture? Resilience and strength? Didn`t she just mention in the previous sentence that she set out to &#8220;empower&#8221; those poor and helpless wretched souls in Haiti? Is resting on your (undeserved) laurels and waiting for aid and succor to fall into your lap after a catastrophe struck your country considered a sign of resilience and civilizational stength nowadays?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Not once did I envision myself becoming a receptacle for a Black man&rsquo;s rage at the white world, but that is what I became.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I never envisioned to read such a racist comment from a progressive woman. This decent black man didn`t rape her, he merely solicited sexual intercouse from her in his own cultural terms. Apparently she doesn`t even have the faintest idea of African culture and decorum. She is well-advised to apologize to this honorable black dignitary whom she slanders as a rapist for being so culturally-ignorant and insensitive.<br>
She should immediately empty her bank account and cede her financial assets (which are the proceeds of the exploitation of blacks anyways) to him and his family as an atonement for her sins.</p>

With her admission that she&rsquo;s &#8216;grateful&rsquo; for the experience, however, I can only console myself with the knowledge that such people are unlikely to reproduce and are thus doing our racial group a small favour. Personally I got a good laugh out of this article - not a callous laugh, but a laugh out of sheer disbelief. A Darwin award for this lady in a few years time, anyone?</p>

<p>It is ridiculous, that only white Europe man<br>
gave women so much rights and still liberal women hate him most. It is just like the story of blacks: <br>
White hardworking American man stopped slavery, he fought for the freedom of blacks, he fought with millions of deaths against Hitler and rescued all none-whites (Hitler wanted to kill all none-whites worldwide)&hellip;<br>
And still white American man is one of the most hated Characters worldwide - not hated bye the former enemies but bye the groups he rescued. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that with white women who hate white men, and I&rsquo;ve met a few.  I told them, &#8220;You do realize it was white men that gave you the right to vote, the right to take off time from work to have a baby, the right to get a job over a man, and all the other things that in non-European countries you women have NO right?&#8221;  </p>
<p>As far as the people we help all the time hating us?  It&rsquo;s not hard to believe.  Remember when we were teenagers and we thought our parents were lame and uncool, yet we always asked them for money or to borrow the car, etc?  That&rsquo;s the same way it is with blacks, women, and liberals.  They bite the hand that feeds.</p>

<p>Amanda Kijera&rsquo;s thinking is part and parcel of Neo-Marxist academic leftwing indoctrination in its most extreme form. I&rsquo;ve personally met similar brain-washed, self-hating, anti-white fanatics in my long academic career. I could almost feel sympathy for the poor sick woman if she hadn&rsquo;t said that she was &ldquo;grateful for the experience&#8221; and blamed the &#8220;as-yet unaddressed white patriarchy&#8221; for the black rapist&rsquo;s crime.  </p>

So, after tossing away her Haiti bracelet in the throes of all the negative emotions felt by rape victims, she felt obliged to get herself back together and continue with the party line of the far left.  </p>

<p>Thank You!  That was my first impression as well.  We all know how mentally ill liberals are, but wouldn&rsquo;t a woman&rsquo;s natural instincts over power the multicultural indoctrination?  Maybe just a little bit?  Maybe I&rsquo;m giving her too much credit, but there&rsquo;s NO WAY a rape victim could say &#8220;I&rsquo;m grateful for the experience.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, but I would think the PTSD type symptoms would NOT allow her to stay in the country where this occurred! </p>

		<p>I encourage everyone to stop and read the comments on the original article. The incredible &#8216;logical&rsquo; contortions that the defenders of Haiti attempt are laugh out loud funny. </p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d offer a simple comparison to chew over:</p>
<p>Nuke and firebomb Japan flat, destroy its capital and labour force and kill millions of it&rsquo;s citizens and it&rsquo;s back 20 years later threatening US economic domination.</p>
<p>Haiti threw off the chains of slavery 200 (!) years ago but has been unable to progress since because it is still &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; periodically by the US stopping by to build a few roads or plant a few trees.</p>
<p>The question remains unanswered (at least in the minds of the wilfully blind): Why is it that blacks require excuses and other races do not?</p>
<p>Alas the excuses never seem to run out, but instead become more outlandish and more fervently held by believers to be true.  I wonder if, in the tiniest recesses of this woman&rsquo;s tiny mind, that her experience have sowed the seeds of a little doubt. I&rsquo;d be fascinated to know.</p>

		<p>It is articles like this that sometimes make me think Margaret (haven&rsquo;t seen her posts in a while) was correct when she wrote that women should not be allowed to vote.  Someone as genuinely stupid as this Kijera individual should be put in a pot and watered twice a day, rather than taken seriously as a member of society.  Fortunately, most women are brighter than this one.</p>
<p>The posters above who characterize politically-correct multiculturalism as a religion are spot-on, and the sadomasochism aspect pointed out by WhitePlight is simply an up-to-date version of the torments the medieval penitents inflicted on themselves; some Philippine Catholics still do this, scourging themselves bloody with whips and/or having themselves crucified.  The difference between the religious penitents and this Marxist nut-job is that she is blaming US for her suffering.</p>

		<p>I find it a bit disturbing that not a single Amren reader has figured out that this was not written by a rape victim and probably was not written by a woman nor someone who was white.</p>
<p>This article was probably written by either a black man or jew as a bit of propaganda designed to try and get white women to fetishize rape by black men as part of liberal indoctrination.  The level of literacy strongly implicates someone who is jewish.</p>
<p>One thing that is certain is that no woman wrote this.  The level of crazy necessary to actually hold beliefs like this would not leave the person functional enough to actually write it.  A crack prostitute might have this level of dissociation from reality.  An educated white could not&hellip;.no matter how liberal they were.</p>
<p>This is the reason why you don&rsquo;t see white liberals living in black neigborhoods.  Actual contact, no matter how incidental, destroys their belief system.  A woman who actually felt this way would NOT feel that way any longer after being raped.  It&rsquo;s obviously a lie&hellip;..and an outrageous one at that.  The topic of the lie isn&rsquo;t something a woman would put pen to paper over.  Think about this a second.  Have you ever met a feminist with this level of crazy before?  I&rsquo;ll answer that question for you&hellip;.no, you haven&rsquo;t.  This person, if this really happened, is unique.</p>
<p>Note that another intended effect of this is to make white men give up on their women.  If it&rsquo;s possible for our women to feel and act this way, then what is the point of protecting them?  It is designed to bring anger and resentment and, most of all, a feeling of hopelessness and futility in white men.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T FALL FOR IT!</p>
<p>Instead, feel anger over the fact that this was written&hellip;..and use your wits to identify who might have a motivation to write it and what that motivation is.  Understand that these people are ENEMIES.  The level of malevolence here is rather intense and deserves an appropriate response.</p>

		<p>Proof, if anyone ever doubted, that liberalism is a sickness. This liberal experiences the most horrific act, short of murder and then excuses the perpetrator of the crime by blaming whites, white males especially. Whether this story is true or not, she is one sick individual and she needs help. Serious mental help. </p>
<p>People need to stop excusing blacks for their actions. Blacks need to stand on their own two feet. If they can&rsquo;t that is their problem, it should not be ours. If blacks commit crimes they must do the time. If the glove fits you can&rsquo;t acquit. </p>
<p>True equality dictates that blacks and whites be treated exactly the same. Tell your politicians to practice what they preach. The more they don&rsquo;t the more whites come over to our side. The more they lie the faster the truth becomes apparent. The truth will out and I hope to live long enough to be apart of the awakening.</p>

		<p>Wow!, where does one begin? First of all so as not to appear misogynist, let me say that I am not in the habit of outright dismissal of a woman&rsquo;s claim of rape, however in this case I&rsquo;ll make an exception.<br>
 No rape victim is going to refer to her attacker as brother unless God forbid he is family. As well trust and believe that no true rape victim will ever say she was &#8221; grateful for the experience&#8221;.<br>
 What I firmly believe we have here is a case of black on white rape fantasy. I would be curious to see the finding of a rape kit, I believe the results would not indicate the all night rape trauma one would expect from a terrified rape victim. I imagine that she would been much more &#8221; grateful for the experience&#8221; had there been 5-6 more of her Haitian &#8220;brothers&#8221; to use her as a &#8220;receptacle&#8221; for their anger. </p>

		<p>I looked at her Facebook, and noticed she has my neighborhood association on her list, as well as a local realtor, and a few other entities.  So I dug harder, and yes, she&rsquo;s white, and Lord help me, she&rsquo;s a neighbor of mine.  This is, BTW, a very heavily white, gentgrified neighborhood in New Orleans.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s one of these nutbags that came here after the storm to &#8220;Enlighten Us And Guide Us TM&#8221;, which really means she came here to stir up hatred against whites struggling to put their lives back together.  We were horribly inundated with these creeps, and they still keep coming, although this Haiti thing (thankfully) took a few of them away.</p>
<p>She is lying.  The story of the rape on the rooftop is someone else&rsquo;s story.  This happened to a well known black woman named Charmaine Neville in the melee after Katrina.  They were on the rooftop to get out of the flood, of course.  Unlike Miz Amanda here, this black woman did not go public with her story as a moral tale to blame The White Oppressor, or to sympathize with the black men who did it.  She went public with it in order to give voice to the many victims of violence in the aftermath of Katrina, in light of a media and government that was trying hard to sweep it under the rug and call us liars. </p>
<p>Here is Charmaine&rsquo;s story, along with several others-<br>

I Googled her and saw her Facebook page and, yep, she is white. What an absolutely lost lost lost soul and totally deceived. How can you be savagely raped by a mindless creature and turn around and blame someone else??? Is this what a college degree gets you  &mdash;  -tens of thousands of her parents dollars pissed away for THIS??? A &#8220;Malcolm X scholar&#8221;? What in the H  &mdash;  - is that?? If my kid came home and told me that she was going to be a Malcolm X scholar, I would leap off a cliff to my death! I don&rsquo;t know whether to pity her parents or want to slap them!! I can honestly say that this has to be the highest form of insanity I have ever come across. The psychopathic nut jobs in movies have nothing on her.</p>

		<p>There is a combat concept that is relevant here, it is &#8220;Friendly Fire&#8221;. Friendly fire is inadvertent firing towards one&rsquo;s own or otherwise friendly forces while attempting to engage enemy forces, particularly where this results in injury or death. It has occurred all wars, and is something the military considers a normal cost of combat.</p>
<p>I think that this is the attitude that Kijera takes toward a Haitian man raping her. She is working to destroy White men and Western civilization, and she regards Black men as valuable allies. She regrets that it was she who was raped, instead of a non-Liberal White man, but she does not want the rape to impair the Feminist-Black alliance. Thus, she excuses her attacker, and claims that evil White men were the real cause of her attack. </p>

		<p>  I prefer to look at the bright side of this. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what percentage white she is. It&rsquo;s obvious what she believes, where her loyalties are, and the extent of her commitment to them. She has made her choice, and I support her. So, the way I see it, she&rsquo;s right where she belongs. Let Darwin take it from here.</p>

The man himself may not be a racist. He may be barely even aware of race.  But it is clear that the woman here is a raging racist. She is totally OBSESSED with the issue of race, and it pervades her every thought and attitude. Of the two, she is the sicker one.</p>

<p>I think that Betty Z. has analyzed it  extremely well.  People like  Ms. Kijera   do not go to places like Haiti, so much to do good for the Haitians, but to fulfill their own  desperate emotional needs.   Over the centuries, nothing much has really changed in this regard.  She is serving herself, and feeling very saintly about it.</p>
<p>As our excellent former poster, Margaret  (mentioned above  by Mr. Scott) used to tell us, in the Middle Ages such  unfulfilled women were shut away into convents where they could lose themselves in visions and mystical ecstasies,  but where they could do no harm and would be safely out of the way of normal society. </p>
<p>Incidentally, what kind of name is &#8220;Kijera&#8221;?   I can&rsquo;t place it.  Sounds sort of African to me.  Not European.  She could be married (or was married) to an African.  The posters on the original article call her Nijera, which would be a Spanish name.  Those comments were quite interesting, btw, and were not at all sympathetic.</p>
<p>A better example of a self-hating white persoin could hardly be found.  A real case, if ever there was one!</p>

		<p>After reading all these posts Ive got a feeling that <br>
this might not be true or she has put  a slant on it<br>
so as to make her absolutely pathological ridiculous <br>
justification of the rape seemingly a little less<br>
ridiculous<br>
It appears she has won a few Associated Press Awards<br>
so perhaps we should  give her as much recognition as <br>
her liberal brainwashed peers have! <br>
 Actually I was listening to talkback radio  here in Melbourne(Australia)<br>
last week where a young chap who rung up as an assault  victim of<br>
an &#8220;ethnic&#8220;(read recent African immigrant) group of young men was trying to somehow justify his  assualt due to so called &#8220;negative&#8220; media portrayals and stereotypes of his assailants<br>
And of course the liberal DJ<br>
just nodded along in aggreement as I kept  shaking my head!<br>
Thank God after reading comments here and in other blogs<br>
it appears theres still enough of us left with common sense<br>
regarding the racial realities of this world.But its also a pity our govt elites are selling out our way of life out with massive<br>
third world immigration..with boatload upon boatload arriving on our unprotected shores its a wonder we havent taken in any<br>
boatloads of Haitians yet! Better to fly them in en masse<br>

		<p>Googling around, I&rsquo;ve found a good bit on the woman.  Seems to be a borderline-white woman (basically, the kind of offwhites who shouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed into the country, in the first place&hellip;), who was &#8216;abused&rsquo; in some way at home, ran away, was a teen prostitute, then married a black, and had two children with him.  But I can find no definite information sources, so this may not be the real story.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s obviously got too much invested in the black thing, at this point, to be able to afford honesty.  I mean, when you&rsquo;ve got two black children, you can&rsquo;t acknowledge your negative realizations about blacks.</p>
<p>I watched our formerly Conservative architect and his wife reinvent themselves in a way that would create a &#8216;cover&rsquo; for their loser son.  Adopting a whole &#8216;creative&rsquo; &#8216;liberal&rsquo; lifestyle, in order to reinforce their assertions that their never-employed son is &#8216;creative&rsquo;: not a &#8216;loser&rsquo;.  So, I can imagine that a woman with two mulatto babies would have no choice but to &#8216;reason&rsquo; her way into the convoluted mess that we read here.</p>

		<p>As to whether this woman is White:  I knew many racially mixed people when I worked in social services.  My acquaintances liked to pass themselves off as White when that had an advantage and as non-White when that had an advantage.  In their private lives, they didn&rsquo;t really think of themselves as White since they were not 100% White. </p>
<p>Actually, they were defiantly proud of their non-White admixture because it made them feel exotic and special.  They idealized the non-White part of their ancestry and were in denial about the negative aspects.  When arrested by the police for minor crimes, those I knew were always listed as White by the police.</p>
<p>I would need to see a video of this woman to know if she is truly White, but she might be a North American Indian/White mix from looking at her photos.  North American Indian/White mixed women tend to be tall, have long, straight black hair, with speaking voices in the deeper range, with straight wide mouths.  They are often attracted to communal living as an ideal.</p>
