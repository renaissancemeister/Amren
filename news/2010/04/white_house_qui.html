<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/us/politics/19muslim.html">White House Quietly Courts Muslims in US</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrea Elliott, New York Times, April 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly a year later, Mr. Obama has yet to set foot in an American mosque. And he still has not met with Muslim and Arab-American leaders. But less publicly, his administration has reached out to this politically isolated constituency in a sustained and widening effort that has left even skeptics surprised.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time in eight years, we have the opportunity to meet, engage, discuss, disagree, but have an impact on policy,&#8221; said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute in Washington. &#8220;We&rsquo;re being made to feel a part of that process and that there is somebody listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the administration&rsquo;s solicitation of Muslims and Arab-Americans has drawn little fanfare, it has not escaped criticism. A small but vocal group of research analysts, bloggers and others complain that the government is reaching out to Muslim leaders and organizations with an Islamist agenda or ties to extremist groups abroad.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just Obama   &mdash;   I think the previous Democrat President also liked to &#8220;reach out&#8221; to Muslims.  In doing so, he and his administration dropped the ball on real terrorism, and, IMHO, spiked any real investigation on what part AQ, OBL or Ramzi Yousef might have played in an event that happened 15 years ago today.</p>

		<p>Golly gee, these muslims are harmless&hellip; so they say.  So why get in a snit about allowing thousands to come into the country?  Surely, they mean no harm and are here because they need a job.  Look to Europe and you can just imagine what it will be like here in a few more years.</p>

		<p>Yes he does quietly court Muslims.  After all, Obama is a Muslim of sorts.  Why wouldn&rsquo;t he do this?  This will further speed up our planned demise.</p>

<p>Well, what a big surprise!</p>
<p>A closeted Muslim mulatto General Secretary, is still playing footsy with his fellow &ldquo;religious&rdquo; flamboyants. One might even call it a bit of rosy rainbow sunshine in a queer green moonlight. </p>
<p>Seriously, if you didn&rsquo;t think this was expected, you never saw photos of El. Presidente Jorge, holding hands with a Saudi Prince. Or you may have missed how certain school districts in this country, allow teaching about Islam as a cultural &ldquo;social studies&rdquo; topic, but exclude any discussion of Judeo-Christian traditions as being &ldquo;exclusionary&rdquo; religious propaganda. Islam, is simply another tool for countercultural Marxists and Neo-Comrades to destroy this country and more specifically, its white population.</p>
<p>Go figure and as always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>This is not surprising. Obama himself had said several times he is a muslim and referred to his muslim faith. His father was a muslim and Obama spent his early and formative years in a muslim school. All this is a matter of record. If the Obama presidency continues for another three years, or God forbid another seven, our beloved country will be unrecognizable as it once was. All because those in positions to do so,i.e. Democrats, fail to oust this probable ursurper from office. </p>

		<p>So now Obama is now going to let muslim activists have a voice in American policy. He is on tape constantly quoting the koran[I may be wrong, but I&rsquo;ve never heard him quote the Bible ].He had a crucifix covered up when he spoke at a church. He said that America is no longer a Christian nation. He changed his birth name friom Barry to Barrack [ a muslim name ]. He recently stopped going to church. Tell me, what will this guy have to do to wake up the sheeple? Every time I see him speak to an audience, I&rsquo;m fixated on the faces of the White fools in the background cheering him on.</p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;ll get you accused of &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; in most places these days to say so, but the problem with this sort of &#8220;outreach&#8221; to Muslim orgs is that even the most &#8220;moderate&#8221; and &#8220;mainstream&#8221; of them have SOME sort of connection to radical and/or terroristic elements back in &#8220;the old country.&#8221; Based on what I&rsquo;ve read at Jihadwatch and other places, this seems to be true of ALL such Muslims orgs. </p>
<p>&hellip;And not just in US, but in EVERY country that has let in Muslims in significant numbers. </p>

		<p>The great Sultan of the New America reaches out to his Muslim brothers? This is a surprise? It should certainly be alarming, but expected. The Muslims are the functional equivalent today the Soviets were during the Cold War. Both seek world domination. But the reaction from the West is far different. We built tanks and nukes to keep the Soviets at bay. The Muslims we welcome with open arms. Now the leader of the free world pow wows with them. Are we insane?</p>

		<p>YES, O will do anything for the Muslim. Show them that &#8220;we&#8221; are really their friends and mean them well.</p>
<p>He would not show one whit of concern for some whitey from Appalachia but for the Muslim everything. Such a very pandering and condescending attitude does no one any good.</p>

		<p>#4 John PM, nailed down so many truths about the &#8220;courting of Muslims&#8221;, by various traitors that have told the American public &#8220;we are in a war with Moslem extremists.&#8221; Really? I wonder how many Japanese and Germans were allowed into the nation during WW2?</p>

		<p>Washington has imported more Muslims since 9/11 than in all the years leading up to 9/11 combined.  </p>
<p>The Globalists have placed a Muslim in the White House to mock and humiliate Americans.  </p>
<p>When Washington invaded Iraq we were told that Iraqi oil would pay for the occupation, not the American taxpayer.  </p>
<p>The hundreds of billions of our tax dollars going to Iraq is draining our economy and driving this growing recession.  </p>
<p>OPEC was founded by Iraq and today American troops are dying in Iraq so that communist China can buy up all the Iraqi oil.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we round up America&rsquo;s political and corporate traitors and offer them that blindfold and one last cigarette&hellip;  </p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to look at how our administrations on both the left and the right court both muslims and jews.</p>
<p>War has been going on between the muslims and jews for a very long time.  That war has spilled over and pulled the west into it.  The first major exchange was during world war II, I think.  It was no accident that Hitler allied himself with the Grand Muftee, nor that Britain crushed him or that the US got into the war at all, despite a determination not to (some things have not changed much since then).</p>
<p>Both sides bribe, beg and threaten our politicians&hellip;..way too successfully.  We have paid an incredibly high price for allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>What is amazing to me is the extent to which the people who live here don&rsquo;t want that to go on, yet it does.  The level of treason is breathtaking.  And the amount of brainwashing necessary to make people forget, is disturbing.</p>
<p>The whole thing seems to be breaking down.  This is both good and bad.  It&rsquo;s good because it allows people to see what is going on and put a stop to it.  It&rsquo;s bad because of the temptation to seek revenge and embroil the world in a third world war because of it.</p>
<p>Our focus should be on making it stop and keeping this out of our lands.  From a distance, then, the focus should be on promoting peace.  This is difficult since both sides have more than their fair share of psychopaths.  But it is possible&hellip;..once we divest ourselves of those very same psychopaths.</p>

		<p>From the original (and long-winded) article: <i>The impact of this continuing dialogue is difficult to measure, but White House officials cited several recent government actions that were influenced, in part, by the discussions. The meeting with Ms. Napolitano was among many factors that contributed to the government&rsquo;s decision this month to end a policy subjecting passengers from 14 countries, most of them Muslim, to additional scrutiny at airports, the officials said.</i></p>
<p>All I can say is it won&rsquo;t be long before the next attack with policies like this one&hellip;</p>

		<p>The muslim religion is a racial religion rather than a fundamental religion.</p>
<p>It is an anti-White religion.</p>
<p>The sooner people wake up to this reality the better off we are.</p>
