<h1>Black Farmers Call on Congress to Pay Racial Bias Settlement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, April 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-American farmers hoping for government settlement money in a racial bias case met with lawmakers Wednesday and called on Congress to come up with a way to fund the $1 billion deal.</p>
<p>A March 31 deadline to appropriate the funds has passed, and farmers now may withdraw from the settlement and pursue independent litigation against the government. Congress now has a target date of the end of May to come up with a plan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Litigation known as the Pigford Case established a longstanding pattern of discrimination at the U.S. Agriculture Department against African-American farmers who had applied for farm loans and support from federal programs.</p>
<p>Under the terms of an involved process overseen by a federal judge and dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. In addition, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has said those farmers may pursue a claim for actual damages from the bias and potentially receive up to $250,000.</p>
<p>Ralph Paige, executive director of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund, said Wednesday that he believed that Congress was &#8220;very close&#8221; to coming up with a way to pay the settlement, which covers as many as 80,000 African-American farmers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, {snip} said lawmakers need to work out how to pay for the settlement under the PAYGO rule, meaning Congress must balance any increased spending with equal savings elsewhere. The other option would be to designate the settlement as an emergency, which would be exempt from PAYGO.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If we cannot find the appropriate vehicle, then I would certainly support declaring this settlement as a national emergency and adding it to the next supplemental that may be on the House floor,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Bunk.  They just want something for nothing, as usual.  The folks who want reparations live in the same fantasy world.  Life is tough, people, and life is NOT fair.  If some people didn&rsquo;t get that set of instructions at birth, too bad - get with &#8216;em now.  This world was never meant to be fair; it was meant as a school for individuals to progress spiritually.  That never looks like &#8220;fair&#8221; in the eyes of the worldly.  Get over it, folks - and accept reality.</p>

		<p>So black &#8220;farmers&#8221;   &mdash;   who may or may not have ever farmed at all, and who may or may not have ever suffered any federal &#8220;discrimination&#8221;   &mdash;   not only demand a taxpayer handout to soothe their injured sensibilities, they want it <i>now</i>.  And it&rsquo;s a &#8220;national emergency&#8221; to put it into their hot little hands at once.</p>

		<p>Sure, I want the black farmers in the US taken care of with my money just as soon as all the white farmers in Zimbabwe get their justice as well.  Fair enough?</p>

		<p>This lawsuit began simply enough in December 1996, when a small group of black farmers demonstrated in front of the White House, complaining about alleged USDA discrimination in its vast farm lending program. Blacks are less than one percent of the farming population but account for three times that proportion of USDA lending (3.2 percent), which suggests the very opposite of deliberate exclusion, but no one pointed this out at the time. The press gave the demonstration more coverage than its small numbers and unsubstantiated claims merited, and shortly afterwards, according to sources within the government, William Clinton told Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to keep complaining blacks &ldquo;out of my back yard.&rdquo; Mr. Glickman, who had been given a cabinet post by Mr. Clinton after being ousted in the 1994 Republican landslide from a House seat he had held for 18 years, was quick to comply. </p>
<p>USDA essentially decided to write a check to virtually any black who stepped forward with a claim of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Within days, Mr. Glickman announced the sudden discovery of rampant discrimination within the department he had headed for nearly two years (and which had been run before him by a black former congressman, Mike Espy). He offered no evidence of racism, but scheduled a series of &ldquo;listening sessions&rdquo; before conceding the lawsuit and paying money out to  very black who claimed he was discriminated against.  This worked so well that thousands and thousands more blacks claimed they were also victims and demanded the case be reopened so they can also receive damages. The government complied and agreed to pay damages to 80,000 new &#8220;victims&#8221;. (Substantial  language taken from AmRen&rsquo;s article &#8220;Who wants to be a Black Millionaire.&#8221;)<br>

		<p>Well, for starters I&rsquo;ve hunted farms all over the Eastern US (with permission), and I&rsquo;ve never encountered a black farmer.</p>
<p>And in closing, I was a new car dealer for over thirty years and can testify that blacks have, on average, the lowest credit scores of any major racial or ethnic group in this country. And this isn&rsquo;t a result of &#8220;being black.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s a function of chronic irresponsibility and an unwillingness to fulfill financial obligations.  Certainly, not all blacks are irresponsible, financially or otherwise. But a disturbing proportion of them are, perhaps a majority, pure and simple.</p>

		<p>You ain&rsquo;t seen nothin yet, just wait til the Mexicans are legal. They&rsquo;ve already started sueing and they&rsquo;re still here illegally. At least we know the blacks are after every handout they can get, but those hard working Mexicans? The only people that will be left with money are the lazy minorities. Who will fund it all?</p>

Well, I live in the northwest, and I&rsquo;ve never seen a &#8220;black farmer&#8221; either. Where are all these black farmers? Most blacks I&rsquo;ve met wouldn&rsquo;t know one end of a shovel from the other, and wouldn&rsquo;t use one if they were shown how.</p>

<p>Yep.  It was just like in Nazi Germany.  They took all the Jews and other prisoners money and possession and killed them off instead of using them as labor to build more luffewaffes, guns, tanks, warships, etc.  So typical of blacks.  They hate the very people that give them everything they demand.<br>

		<p>I have lived in a small town in south-western Mississippi for the past five years.  My wife and I have to drive through 25 miles of farmland just to make a trip to Wal-mart (I honestly don&rsquo;t mind the drive, as the land is beautiful).  I have yet to see or meet a black farmer, even though the racial mix in our area is approximately 87% black to 13% white.  In fact, the black owned trailers and shacks in the countryside never even have so much as a vegetable garden next to them.  I personally know a white farmer who has to bring in Mexican farm workers just to help him harvest his crops, and this in an area with untold hordes of able-bodied black men who need work.  Needless to say, the black men are totally uninterested in doing the work, hence the need for Mexicans.  I am a Christian, and I know that a blanket prejudice based solely on race is wrong.  But it is also clear that black people as a whole do not do farm work-it is somehow beneath them.  On a related note-I believe that vast numbers of young white people will be turning to subsistence farming in the near future, as there is very much fallow ground in America just crying out to be worked.  If I were a young guy, I would seriously consider farming rather than college.  </p>
