<h1>Hungary&rsquo;s Ruling Socialists Suffer Stinging Defeat</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pablo Gorondi, Yahoo! News, April 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hungary&rsquo;s center-right party reclaimed the right to govern on Sunday, winning over 50 percent of the vote and handing the ruling Socialists a humiliating defeat. Extreme rightists backed by black clad paramilitary troops took more than 15 percent to come in third.</p>
<p>While widely forecast, the strong gain of the extreme right Jobbik party represented the greatest political shake-up of the election, shattering Hungary&rsquo;s traditional post-communist status quo of a parliament dominated by the center right and the left.</p>
<p>Fidesz&rsquo;s landslide victory had been expected by pollsters and its result of 52.8 percent in the first round translated into 206 seats for now in the 386-seat legislature.</p>
<p>The governing Socialists, whom many Hungarians blame for their dismal economy, were far behind with 19.3 percent and 28 seats, followed closely by the far-right, anti-Gypsy Jobbik with 26 seats and 16.7 percent  &mdash;  over three times as much as any other far-right party since the country&rsquo;s return to democracy from communism in 1990.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A green party, Politics Can Be Different, exceeded expectations with 7.4 percent and 5 seats ahead of a second round on April 25 when the fate of the remaining 111 seats is decided in runoffs for 57 constituencies where no candidate got at least half the votes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jobbik, which burst onto the political scene last year with a nationalist platform blaming Gypsies and Jews for many of the country&rsquo;s problems, claimed that only a series of scandals about some of its candidates created by the media prevented it from overtaking the Socialists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jobbik&rsquo;s rise also has been aided by the popularity of the Magyar Garda, or Hungarian Guard, an extremist group whose uniforms are reminiscent of those worn in the 1940s by the Arrow Cross, Hungary&rsquo;s infamous wartime Nazi party.</p>
<p>The Garda was co-founded by Vona, the Jobbik leader, although he is no longer an active member. It was disbanded last year by the courts for breaking laws governing the operation of groups and associations, but it continues to exist under a new name.</p>
<p>The Garda&rsquo;s most confrontational actions have been a series of marches through small countryside towns and villages meant to intimidate their large Gypsy populations and stop what Jobbik calls &#8220;Gypsy crimes&#8221;  &mdash;  mostly petty thefts too numerous and considered too minor for police to deal with.</p>
<p>An unprecedented series of Roma killings in 2008 and 2009 claimed six lives in several villages, reflecting the depth of hatred against the minority.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough that this is only the beginning.</p>
<p>Note the &#8220;Extreme rightists backed by black clad paramilitary troops&#8221; propaganda.  It&rsquo;s this propaganda that is primarily responsible for the far right not being dominant in politics.  But that is starting to crumble.</p>
<p>Put bluntly, people are starting to figure out who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  And they are giving the good guys a toe hold in politics.  Now that they are in, it becomes completely impossible to keep people from finding out the truth about what they are all about.  This exposure will cause a deluge of support.</p>
<p>First in eastern europe/former soviet states, then in western europe (starting to catch up this year I notice).  Finally in america.</p>

		<p>Is there any member of any large news organization that tells the truth?  Sure the Roma commit plenty of petty crimes (definition of a petty crime: one that didn&rsquo;t happen to you) which is bad enough but the other crimes, yikes.  I try to read Hungarian news sources when I have the time and the rapes, murders and street robbery are out of control.  What the Roma do to their Hungarian victims is very similar to what the blacks do to Afrikaners and Euro-Americans.  Pet crime is crime and it leads to major crime.  Those people are NOT Magyars, do not belong in tiny little Hungary and should be expelled.  Look at the photos of the 80 year old woman they rape and bludgeon.  Awful.  Go Jobbik go!<br>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m delighted to see the Socialists booted out of power, I don&rsquo;t want a return to the Nazi-ism of the &#8216;30&rsquo;s and &#8216;40&rsquo;s.  I see no reason to blame the problems of Hungary on any ethnic group - that&rsquo;s just a cowardly way of sidestepping the real issues and coming up with solutions therefor.  Luckily, the Nazis are third instead of first here.  Hopefully that&rsquo;s where they will stay.</p>

So then, what ARE the &#8220;real issues&#8221; and who is responsible for them?  Problems don&rsquo;t just cause themselves; people cause problems.  Can&rsquo;t you be more specific?  Don&rsquo;t tease!  If you have the answers to these problems, why don&rsquo;t you just tell us? </p>

<p>Ever notice how there&rsquo;s no middle ground in the language the leftist (AKA &#8220;mainstream&#8221;) media uses to refer to anyone to the right of Mao?  They&rsquo;re either &#8220;center-right&#8221; (neocon collaborators, &#8220;respectable conservatives,&#8221; etc.), or they&rsquo;re &#8220;extreme rightist&#8221; fascist-nazi-hater-bigots.</p>

		<p>Once again, the left trots out unfounded charges of anti-semitism. The <i>alleged</i> anti-semitism is largely based on a single comment left on one of it&rsquo;s message boards. The irony is that the woman who <i>allegedly</i> made the comment was married to a Hungarian Jew with whom she has three children. Given the nature of the comment (which I won&rsquo;t repeat) and that she is now separated from him a reasonable conclusion is that it was motivated by marital problems.</p>

<p>That is the most moronic claptrap I&rsquo;ve read in a long time.  They are not Nazis!  And Gypsies ARE causing MANY problems in Hungary.  Certainly not all of them, but it is the same WHEREVER they go.  </p>
<p>I repeat, Jobbik are NOT NAZIS.  Do you swallow EVERYTHING you read in the MSM?  </p>
<p>God Bless Hungary!  God Bless Jobbik!</p>

		<p>Notice he doesn&rsquo;t identify what these &#8220;real issues&#8221; are.  Crime is a problem.  Gypsies seem to be commiting more than their fair share of it.  This has nothing to do with anything that happened during World War II.</p>

<p>AAAAA again with the anti-Semitism! I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it, even though I&rsquo;m not familiar with Jobbik. How can I believe anything the media tells me, when I&rsquo;ve even read articles accusing Geert Wilders of anti-Semitism. In Europe it&rsquo;s always anti-Semitism this, anti-Semitism that, everything is anti-Semitism, just like everything is racism in US. But incredibly it&rsquo;s also the Jewish organizations which are fuelling this paranoia that everybody on the right is an anti-Semite. They&rsquo;re doing this at the same time while Muslims are beating up Jews and burning up synagogues. Jewish organizations are fighting an imaginary enemy on the right in order to get donations from the wealthy American Jews who don&rsquo;t have a clue about what&rsquo;s happening in Europe. These organizations tell rich American Jewish elite that anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe, but they don&rsquo;t tell them that it&rsquo;s coming from the Muslims. They don&rsquo;t want to lose their donors. People who run Jewish organizations are throwing regular European Jews under the bus for their own personal financial gain. Does that remind you of anything?<br>

<p>   Extreme by what standards?  I dislike this clumsy attempt to depict Jobbik as a new group of &#8220;Black Hundreds&#8221;, the anti-democratic Czarist murderer/thugs who were responsible for so many awful Jewish massacres in Russia and the Ukraine. Jobbik is a democratic party of patriots that seeks power peacefully.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m speaking out of order here since I&rsquo;m uninformed of the politics there. However knowing how things are reported here in AmeriKa. I&rsquo;m attempting to read between the lines, and it has been my experience that any who disagree with the mantra of the left will be labeled,usually as radical,or nazi,or terrorists. Case in point the Tea Partiers or basically any group, that displays some common sense. or patriotism. So in closing I guess I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m taking the jist of this article with a grain of salt. My advice, believe nothing you hear, and only half of what you see.</p>

		<p>3) You seem to be falling into the same trap that leftists always set.</p>
<p>Saying that gypsies should get jobs and participate in the economy and go to jail when they commit crimes does not make you a nazi racist fascist.</p>
<p>Now if you were saying they should be gassed, that would make you a racist at the very least.  </p>
<p>I had misgivings about Jobbik too, right up until I went to their website where they pretty much explain how the media is constantly lying about them.  Their &#8220;paramilitary&#8221; arm doesn&rsquo;t even carry weapons.</p>

Wow!  &#8220;Extreme rightists&#8221;  who believe that Gypsies (er, Roma, sorry) should work and abide by the law sound really scary! What will they come up with next?  I&rsquo;ll bet those  black clad  &#8220;troops&#8221;  were even wearing jackboots.  Can&rsquo;t you hear them coming now?   And they &#8220;took&#8221;  the election from the Socialists. Sounds like it was a rightwing coup, at the least   &mdash;   the death of democratic government. Clearly, something has to be done about this scary development. How can decent people stand by and allow this?</p>
