			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, April 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrant-rights groups sought to tap some of the &#8220;tea party&#8221; thunder Thursday by using the anti-tax-and-spending movement&rsquo;s nationwide protests to argue illegal immigrants must be legalized because they are eager to pay their full taxes. </p>
<p>But tea partiers, rallying on the day federal income-tax returns were due, didn&rsquo;t buy it. </p>
<p>The collision between two of the big political movements in America is expected to escalate heading in to this year&rsquo;s midterm elections as both push the political parties from different directions. </p>
<p>&#8220;Here there are people who don&rsquo;t want to pay taxes, and we&rsquo;re saying there are all these people who want to carry the load and we don&rsquo;t allow them to,&#8221; said Mary Moreno, a spokeswoman for the Center for Community Change. She led a delegation that delivered five boxes of blank tax forms to a Capitol Hill office as a symbol of all the tax money left uncollected because illegal immigrants have not been legalized. </p>
<p>The Immigration Policy Center and the Center for American Progress, two liberal-leaning think tanks, have estimated that legalizing illegal immigrants would generate between $4.5 billion and $5.4 billion in tax revenues over three years. </p>
<p>Tea party supporters mocked the idea. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2006 and 2007, immigrant-rights marches and rallies drew millions of people to the streets of major cities and helped propel an immigration bill to the Senate floor both years. Neither bill made it out of Congress, but backers say the strength of Hispanic and immigrant votes helped send President Obama to the White House. </p>
<p>Since Mr. Obama took office, though, the tea parties have become the political movement to watch, with rallies across the nation attracting thousands of supporters, and with lawmakers in Washington trying to figure out how to harness the movement&rsquo;s energy. </p>
<p>The two forces have even gone head to head. Last month, on the day the health care bill passed the House, tea party supporters gathered on the Capitol&rsquo;s West Front lawn to voice their opposition, while blocks away tens of thousands of immigrants-rights supporters held a rally to demand legalization. </p>
<p>But some immigrant-rights backers argue that there should be a natural point of agreement between the two groups, and they point to studies that suggest legalizing illegal immigrants would be an overall help to taxpayers. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Lynn Tramonte, deputy director at America&rsquo;s Voice, a leading immigration advocacy group, said the tea party is an outgrowth of anxiety over the government&rsquo;s failure to solve problems. She said if Congress could pass a bipartisan immigration bill it could show government can work. </p>
<p>She said polls don&rsquo;t show immigration being a galvanizing issue for tea party supporters, who have organized primarily around opposition to expanded government and too much spending. </p>
<p>Ms. Moreno said she&rsquo;s seen signs that anti-illegal-immigrant groups keep trying to co-opt the tea party, &#8220;but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve had much success.&#8221; </p>
<p>Still, [Rep. Steve] King (R-IA), who has ties to tea party groups and is a leader on calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration, said tea partiers are more likely to come out in support of stronger border security and more immigration enforcement. </p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a very strong conviction toward border security and the rule of law within people that have gotten newly active in the tea party. It has to be there, whether it&rsquo;s been voiced or not, because they are constitutionalists,&#8221; he said. </p>

		<p>The only flaw in their plans is that Hispanic immigrants, legal and illegal combined, take far more in tax money than they pay in.  But even if they didn&rsquo;t take anything, the Federal treasury, Social Security and otherwise, is still not getting as much as it would, because the Hispanics, especially the illegals, tend to work cheap labor jobs.  The less money you make, the less you pay in taxes.  And with the EITC and child deductions, there are a lot of &#8220;taxpaying&#8221; Hispanics that don&rsquo;t pay any taxes.</p>

		<p>Could have fooled me. Years ago I helped a Jamaican immigrant do her taxes. She was able to take the earned income tax credit because she had only worked in the U.S. for six months. These days the government is spending our tax money to remind low income earners to be sure to take the earned income tax credit. Which is more money than they in fact paid in taxes. I wonder how many illegal aliens make enough money to even have to pay taxes. According to the news over 45 per cent of the population paid no taxes.</p>

<p>How utterly laughable, it seems that these &ldquo;immigrant-rights backers&rdquo; have truly addled brains.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a PhD in economics, to figure out that the alien invaders (because of both their racial and cultural incompatibility with the USA) are merely a highly exotic and toxic drain on our socioeconomic system. California serves as a prime example of what the USA will be like, when present projected diversity goals are achieved. Whites will be reduced to a productive minority of about 48% to 45%, that no longer has the ability to sustain the new nonwhite majority&rsquo;s unrealistic needs and wants. According to the rainbow propaganda, California should simply be the most &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; state in the union due to its &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; and progressive social services, but it isn&rsquo;t. In reality, it is going bankrupt and no solutions to this problem can be found, simply because the diversity cornucopia is endlessly giving what is its real abundance, divisiveness. </p>
<p>Indeed: &ldquo;The collision between two of the big political movements in America is expected to escalate heading in to this year&rsquo;s midterm elections as both push the political parties from different directions.&rdquo;  I simply ask, what else is new?</p>
<p>There will be no sociopolitical peace in this country, until we have a generalized reemergence of racial consciousness in the white population that demands both American Apartheid and a return of a white majority within that framework overtime, to a minimum of 85% or better.</p>
<p>May God let it be so!</p>

		<p>These people are not trying to convince the tea party with their absurd arguments, they are addressing their own supporters and the media.  They want the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to see the tea party as an enemy (the White man) who refuses to cooperate with all these hard-working would be taxpayers, and they want the media to adopt their lie as the official truth.  The media are looking for a spin on the TP that will neutralize them and recognize that the R word might be a hard sell these days, but it&rsquo;s all they know.  What a dilemma!</p>

		<p>&#8221; there are a lot of &ldquo;taxpaying&rdquo; Hispanics that don&rsquo;t pay any taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is much worse than that: Because Hispanics tend to have large families and low salaries, they actually are given money at tax time via the &#8220;Earned Income Tax Credit.&#8221;  This nefarious government program is nothing but redistribution of wealth from people who can achieve to people who cannot achieve.  While you and I pay money at tax time, large numbers of Minorities actually receive money at tax time, through this government give-away program.  Note that the government tries to hide the real purpose of this program through its confusing name.</p>

		<p>Given that the typical illegal alien, when working at all, is working for something not far from the minimum wage (which is why they get hired, after all) I doubt that even if they are legalized their tax contribution will come close to what they cost in social services.  Is some guy earning $8 an hour likely to pay enough property taxes to fund the education of his 6 kids?  Is he paying enough federal taxes to fund his new government &#8220;free&#8221; health care?  Not likely at all.  Those illegals who continue to work will generally qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which means they&rsquo;ll be a drain on federal funds.  Indeed, some of those hard working illegal aliens who now avoid welfare because of the trouble involved in getting fake id to qualify will decide, once they are citizens, that going on the dole beats working for peanuts.  (Just as so many black women do now.)</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t have 20 million illegal immigrants the resulting &#8220;labor shortage&#8221; would cause most of those $8 an hour jobs to become $12 or $15 an hour jobs, and the people doing them would come closer to paying their fair share of the taxes.  Of course it is precisely because illegal immigration keeps wages low that organs of corporate globalism, such as the Wall Street Journal, are all in favor of it.<br/>

		<p>Hmm, give them amnesty and they can legally take more jobs Americans need right now. I live in Calif. and it is almost impossible to find even a low paying job. Why do we need more people looking to take jobs that we need so badly. I truly believe illegals are treated better then legal citizens in Calif.</p>

		<p>Our legions of scathingly corrupt employers will never hire legalized aliens.  They will continue to hire illegals.  The criminal Hispanic invaders and the corporate economic traitors are a match made in hell.</p>
<p>Wannabe legitimate immigrants must show proof of financial responsibility, pass a criminal background check and prove they aren&rsquo;t disease carriers.  This is simply to acquire legal residency.  Congress wants to waive these requirements for illegals and reward them with citizenship for breaking our laws.</p>
<p>This miscarriage of justice is intended to encourage additional tens of millions of future illegals to continue swarming our borders annualy in search of jobs made vacant by legalizing the illegals that once held them.</p>
<p>Those newly legalized immigrant criminals will join the ranks of the unemployed and devastate our welfare system by becoming wards of the state for life&hellip;       <br/>

		<p> What has gone unsaid and continues to be left out is the simple reality of economics. Illegal backers claim tax benefits because of taxes &#8220;paid&#8221; by illegals.</p>
<p> BUT !!!  Illegals send most of their cash to family members in their home countries. The second largest source of revenue to Mexico, behind petroleum, is the vast amount of dollars sent by illegals in the form of remittances. That cash is paid to the illegal and then removed from our economy. It isn&rsquo;t spent here and benefits no businesses in the US. This is a drain above and beyond the &#8220;benefits&#8221; they get by simply being in the US. </p>
<p> As a previous poster pointed out, simply look at California and think of Camp of the Saints. The number of hospitals that have gone belly-up in CA is staggering. Welcome to the new Aztec Empire!</p>

		<p>If, according to the immigrant right groups, &#8220;illegal immigrants must be legalized because they are eager to pay their full taxes&#8221;, then why don&rsquo;t they propose bringing in tens or hundreds of millions of immigrants from all over the world?  By this logic, the U.S. could get rid of its $13 trillion national debt from the injection in tax revenues in no time.</p>
<p>I bet the immigrant rights group have never heard the term &#8220;Limits to Grwoth&#8221;. (BTW, there is a website named like that, which is run by Brenda Walker who provides resourceful news articles related to immigration from the 3rd world: www.limitstogrowth.org)</p>

		<p>#16, an invader files for an ITIN and files his taxes using that number so he can get a refund using the EITC. He&rsquo;ll get back more than he ever paid in.</p>
<p>Topic 857 - Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) – Form W-7</p>
<p>A taxpayer identification number must be furnished on all returns, statements, and other tax-related documents and must be given upon request to any other person who must include it on a return or statement. For most individuals this is a Social Security Number, or SSN. If you are a foreign person who does not have and is not eligible to get an SSN you must use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN. </p>
<p>Individuals needing an ITIN include: </p>
<p>A nonresident alien individual eligible to obtain the benefits of a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty <br/>
A nonresident alien required to file a U.S. tax return or filing a U.S. tax return only to claim a refund <br/>
A nonresident alien electing to file a joint tax return with a spouse who is a U.S. citizen or resident alien <br/>
An alien individual claimed as a spouse for an exemption on a U.S. tax return <br/>
An alien individual claimed as a dependent on another person&rsquo;s U.S. tax return <br/>
A nonresident alien student, professor, or researcher filing a U.S. tax return or claiming an exception to the tax return filing requirement, or <br/>

Tea Partiers, unlike the illegals pulling every possible card of advantage, have long known that there already IS a legal way for those bozos to pay taxes: put your name on the list and come in here legally.</p>

<p>Is there anyone, brain-dead or otherwise, that believes this?</p>
<p>Do you wonder why California, even with satanic taxes, is dead broke?</p>
<p>According to the LA Times</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;40% of all workers in L.A. County are working for cash and not paying taxes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Or, as LA&rsquo;s finest chronicler reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;They reach the cashier and out come the food stamp cards and WIC tickets and vouchers. Government freebie tickets you and I pay for, dear reader. I have seen this happen right in front of me with the [person] in question with a big roll of cash in their hand while they peel off food stamps and WIC vouchers. </p>
<p> Anyway, the illegal alien&rsquo;s got a big wad of cash because he works for cash under the table while working the system with several names. He isn&rsquo;t married to the kids&rsquo; mother, so she&rsquo;s a &#8216;single mother&rsquo; and that qualification ensures they get all sorts of extra goodies from Uncle Sam&hellip;&#8221; </p>

<p>Yes, also the American Third Position.</p>
<p>The Republican party does not advance White interests and is in no way conservative.  They continue to support high levels of non-White immigration and treasury-busting, overseas wars in Third World hell-holes.</p>
<p>From OO:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;One of the reasons I was attracted to American Third Position was the presence of young men willing to go out into the street and very publicly proclaim their beliefs. &hellip;The young men who are the backbone of the party go out onto the streets with signs and pamphlets advocating deporting illegals and other issues related to pro-White advocacy. They are not afraid of people spewing in-your-face hostility at them&hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>So illegals pay taxes? Wonder what kind of mathematical magic it takes to make that claim a valid one. An illegal, getting paid under the table? An illegal with little skills, earning barely the minimum wage&hellip; claiming the maximum number of dependents (like WHO is actually going to verify the number)&hellip; Now just how MUCH income tax will that illegal actually pay?</p>
<p>I have had it up to here with those absurd claims. Meaningless LIES trying to make the illegals look good&hellip; while ignorning the reality they will get hundreds, if not thousands of times more in government funded (taxpayer-paid) services than they can ever pay in taxes.</p>
<p>Sure, they&rsquo;ll pay a pittance in social security taxes. A pittance in sales taxes. But considering their low wage earning ability, that does not translate to a lot of spendable income. So again, HOW MUCH (rather how little) will they pay in yearly taxes&hellip; including sales taxes, etc.?</p>
