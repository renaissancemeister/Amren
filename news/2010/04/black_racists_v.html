<h1>Black Racists Vow to &#8220;Rape and Kill&#8221; White World Cup Fans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"Europe," European Times, April 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A VILE Facebook campaign to incite race hate ahead of the World Cup in South Africa in June is being investigated by police.</p>
<p>The official probe was launched into a group set up by alleged supporters of firebrand politician Julius Malema.</p>
<p>One entry, emailed to football fans around the world, calls for the &#8220;rape and slaughter&#8221; of whites and the murder of President Jacob Zuma.</p>
<p>In a chilling message a Malema &#8220;fan&#8221; called Thato Mbateti Mbateti warns: &#8220;Every trespasser, namely white whores, we will rape them and kill them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. White kids will be burned.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaign comes amid growing tensions in South Africa after the murder of white supremacist Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p>Yesterday angry crowds clashed outside a court in Ventersdorp, near Johannesburg, as two black farm workers, aged 15 and 21, appeared accused of killing the 69-year-old who had campaigned for all-white states within South Africa.</p>
<p>Bitter memories of the apartheid era were evoked when 2,000 people gathered and police used razor wire to separate the factions. The case was adjourned until next week.</p>
<p>South African leaders, including President Zuma, have called for calm after the killing of Terreblanche. But right-wing fanatics have vowed vengeance.</p>
<p>Malema, who leads the youth wing of Zuma&rsquo;s African National Congress party, was reportedly under police guard after alleged death threats against him. The Facebook page, which attracted more than 15,000 followers, has been shut down. Malema and the ANCYL insisted it was not an official supporters&rsquo; page.</p>
<p>Lawrence Schlemmer, vice president of the South African Institute of Race Relations, said: &#8220;There is no reason why these things, as tragic as they are, should affect the safety of fans or players at the World Cup. The World Cup and sport, as it is supposed to, channels passions and reconciles conflict.&#8221;</p>

		<p>No doubt the solution of the western governments, is to allow thousands upon thousands of these blacks to emigrate to our countries.</p>
<p>Surely their hate will disappear once being forcibly integrated with whites, on the white tax payer dime of course.</p>

<p>HBO, PBS, Nightline and other programs have done specials on this.</p>

		<p>We should follow the wise example of Fidel Castro: empty our prisons of African-Americans by offering them immediate release to South Africa (might be a good idea to extend the offer to Henry Gates, Jr. and other reparations advocates). Simultaneously: we should open our borders to white South Africans  &mdash;  any who wish to leave should be immediately granted a green card. </p>

<p>HA HA HA HA HA HA!<br>
I just can&rsquo;s stop laughing. <br>
This sounds like Hitler&rsquo;s lame proclamaitions about &#8220;Fortress Europe,&#8221; just before the Allies stormed it, and crushed the Nazi state&rsquo;s ill-gotten gains. <br>
Look, here&rsquo;s the truth, that any fool can see:<br>
The world cup will have low attendance from foreign whites, and will be marred by violience, possibly a great bloodbath.<br>
And nobody saw it coming?<br>
Hold an event (any event) in SOUTH FREAKING AFRICA?????? What, are you insane?<br>
Wow, humanity is too stupid to survive.</p>

		<p>To poster 2: You are so right.  This is their answer to everything.  Poverty and disfunction in Haiti?  Bring &#8216;em over here!  Violence and chaos in Somalia?  Bring &#8216;em over here.  Trouble in (fill in the blank)?  Bring &#8216;em over here!</p>
<p>Social justice minded white liberals will fix everything!  We don&rsquo;t have enough disfunction over here!  Bring more and the problems will solve themselves through diversity!</p>
<p>What happens when there are no more whites in contiguous settings left to bring &#8216;disadvantaged&rsquo; people into?  Should China, that land of social inequality yet wealthy, be the next target for diversity?  I don&rsquo;t think they will cooperate.</p>

		<p>As a British born but lived in SA for 24 years and was an optimistic citizen there, the Liberals just do not know what they are playing with.  Even many educated black people in SA are scared of the future under that Marxist trained terrorist government.  Electricity price is to be increased each year by 27% and already the massive electrical power cuts are continuing (over two years now) due to the mis management of the power systems by the new governing administration.  Just imagine being at a night match among all the criminals when the lights go out?  Please do not misunderstand me, most of the black people are not criminals but a big percentage are as they struggle even more now under the new government that promised so much, and has broken most the promises so far except for the political leaders who have benefited.    </p>
<p>Remember that normally you are 10 times more likely to be unlawfully killed in SA than in the USA.  Make sure if you are going, that your insurance includes the repatriation of your body, just in case.</p>

		<p>June #11 you may just get your wish.  Take a look at the way things are happening in Georgia:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/2gymd73</p>
<p>From the bottom of the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Senate has also adopted a resolution calling for President Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress to secure America&rsquo;s borders and fix the country&rsquo;s broken immigration system.</p>
<p>Sen. John Wiles, R-Kennesaw, proposed the legislation, which passed by a vote of 34-9. The measure cites &ldquo;mounting difficulties in dealing with the rampant unemployment of citizens and lawful workers who have waited in line, played by the rules and legally joined the American family&rdquo; and says Georgia&rsquo;s security and economy is threatened by illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Wiles says any immigration reform proposed by Congress and enacted should not reward people who have come here illegally or provide amnesty to those who broke the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, by all means the border states need to step up to the plate.  It&rsquo;s their failures that cause the illegal alien problems we have in other states.  Border states are their highway to the homeland.  </p>
<p>But really, ANY state with an illegal alien problem needs to become part of this NOW.  While there is still momentum.  Liberals know very well how to exploit this kind of streak!</p>

		<p>Guys, be prepared for disappointment.  I imagine the games will be held, and that there will be rapes and murders aplenty (yes, even more rapes and murders than usual).  But you can be assured &#8216;The Powers That Be&rsquo; have already figured out how they are going to spin the story.</p>
<p>The World will believe that white racists were behind the attacks.  Or that the legacy of Apartheid motivated the poor blacks who (insert unspeakable crimes here) the World Cup fans.</p>
<p>Remember Katrina?  Remember seeing live coverage of the nightmare in the Superbowl?  Remember how quickly we were subsequently &#8216;reassured&rsquo; that what we had witnessed on live TV was &#8216;just rumors&rsquo;?  Some of my old college chums are members of New Orleans&rsquo; (High Yellow) Black Elite: intimates and former Prep School classmates  of the inner-circle who control the city.  Their husbands track &#8216;Katrina Crimes&rsquo; in a way that reminds me of Civil War buffs.  They ALL assure me that what we heard on live TV was accurate, and that there was then a massive coverup of the extent of black crime; before, during, and after Katrina.</p>
<p>Remember just a few months back, the new spin?  Now, the revisionists are packaging the &#8220;Real&#8221; story of Katrina as an episode of helpless blacks being hunted down by white racists.</p>
<p>Katrina got the propaganda machine whipped into shape.  I expect they&rsquo;ve learned their lessons, and are going to do a better and faster (maybe simultaneous) job of repackaging the upcoming WORLD CUP MASSACRE.</p>

<p>Shame on you!! As an educator for several decades I can testify to the conditioning of our (Euro- American youth). How can you take any pleasure in the mere suggestion that Whites would be raped and killed? These starry eyed European and American youth are the products of our ignorance of what was going on in our schools on both continents. We let it happen. We entrusted out kids to the educational system but we failed to challenge what our kids were being taught.</p>

		<p>The soccer cup tv ads are absolutely nauseating.  They make attending the South African games something akin to walking through the pearly gates.</p>
<p>I hope folks get on some of the sports websites and start warning people about conditions in South Africa.  This will be the only way that they will know the truth.  Warn people but be tactful with what you say.</p>

All you brain dead Caucasians out there. Stay the HELL home and watch it on TV.<br>
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if SA held an expensive party and nobody came?<br>
Perhaps the coup de grace for that poor excuse for a country with it&rsquo;s government of hoodlums. Hey wait, that sounds like our own country!<br>
