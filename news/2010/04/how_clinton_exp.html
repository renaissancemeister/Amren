<h1>How Clinton Exploited Oklahoma City for Political Gain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Byron York, Washington Examiner, April 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing Monday, former President Bill Clinton is playing a starring role in the liberal effort to draw what the New York Times calls &#8220;parallels between the antigovernment tone that preceded that devastating attack and the political tumult of today.&#8221; The short version of the narrative is: Today&rsquo;s Tea Partiers are tomorrow&rsquo;s right-wing bombers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clinton was in deep political trouble in April 1995. Six months earlier, voters had resoundingly rejected Democrats in the 1994 mid-term elections, giving the GOP control of both House and Senate. Polls showed the public viewed Clinton as weak, incompetent and ineffective. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his GOP forces seized the initiative on virtually every significant issue, while Clinton appeared to be politically dead. The worst moment may have come on April 18, the day before the bombing, when Clinton plaintively told reporters, &#8220;The president is still relevant here.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then came the explosion at the Murrah Federal Building. In addition to seeing a criminal act and human loss, Clinton and Morris saw opportunity. If the White House could tie Gingrich, congressional Republicans and conservative voices like Rush Limbaugh to the attack, then Clinton might gain the edge in the fight against the GOP.</p>
<p>Morris began polling about Oklahoma City almost immediately after the bombing. On April 23, four days after the attack, Clinton appeared to point the finger straight at his political opponents during a speech in Minneapolis. &#8220;We hear so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each other,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They spread hate. They leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a White House meeting four days later, on April 27, Morris presented Clinton with a comeback strategy based on his polling. Morris prepared an extensive agenda for the session, a copy of which he would include in the paperback version of his 1999 memoir, Behind the Oval Office. This is how the April 27 agenda began:</p>
<p>AFTERMATH OF OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Later, under the heading &#8220;How to use extremism as issue against Republicans,&#8221; Morris told Clinton that &#8220;direct accusations&#8221; of extremism wouldn&rsquo;t work because the Republicans were not, in fact, extremists. Rather, Morris recommended what he called the &#8220;ricochet theory.&#8221; Clinton would &#8220;stimulate national concern over extremism and terror,&#8221; and then, &#8220;when issue is at top of national agenda, suspicion naturally gravitates to Republicans.&#8221; As that happened, Morris recommended, Clinton would use his executive authority to impose &#8220;intrusive&#8221; measures against so-called extremist groups. Clinton would explain that such intrusive measures were necessary to prevent future violence, knowing that his actions would, Morris wrote, &#8220;provoke outrage by extremist groups who will write their local Republican congressmen.&#8221; Then, if members of Congress complained, that would &#8220;link right-wing of the party to extremist groups.&#8221; The net effect, Morris concluded, would be &#8220;self-inflicted linkage between [GOP] and extremists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clinton&rsquo;s proposals  &mdash;  for example, new limits on firearms and some explosives that were opposed by the National Rifle Association  &mdash;  had &#8220;an underlying political purpose,&#8221; Morris wrote in 2004 in another book about Clinton, Because He Could. That purpose was &#8220;to lead voters to identify the Oklahoma City bombing with the right wing. By making proposals we knew the Republicans would reject .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we could label them as soft on terror an imply a connection with the extremism of the fanatics who bombed the Murrah Federal Building.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a political strategy crafted while rescue and recovery efforts were still underway in Oklahoma City. And it worked better than Clinton or Morris could have predicted. {snip}<br>

		<p>After the Okla. City bombing, Clinton said that he hoped the perpetrators could not be traced to the Middle East.  If they had been, he would have had to take serious action which he never wanted to do when American interests were attacked by Muslim terrorists.  So it was lucky for him that the two front men on the Okla. City attack were American white guys.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of opinions on the matter, but the 15th anniv. of OKC has bought Waco back into the forefront, and there&rsquo;s a new slap-happy blame game on about who is really responsible.  Truthfully, I trust Dick Morris about as far as I could throw him.  He might be right now in saying that it was all Bill Clinton&rsquo;s fault, but don&rsquo;t forget, as it says here, Morris told Clinton how to exploit it against Nut Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh.</p>
<p>I personally had just gotten comfortable with the notion that Deputy AG Jamie Gorelick, who would later become the infamous architect of the infamous &#8220;wall&#8221; separating foreign services intelligence and domestic LEA intelligence on radical Islamists, which may have precluded enough relevant Federal agencies from seeing 9/11 coming, was where the buck stopped with Waco.</p>
<p>Now, Morris is blaming Clinton, Clinton is still pointing fingers at Janet Reno, and Hillary Clinton I guess was too busy baking cookies to know anything.  </p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t lionize the Branch Davidians, because they were big into race mixing.  Ironically, a real K-person went to the site of the standoff and implored the ATF to assault the compound for that very reason.  So how bout that, the Clinton administration&rsquo;s ATF took the advice of a K-person.  If they were that big of a threat, then the ATF could have picked Koresh up on one of the many mornings he went out for a jog, unarmed, I might add.  The whole BD cult (yes, I think they were a cult) would have fallen apart with him in the hoosegow.  But the children would still have been living.</p>

		<p>Strangely enough, I recall that tense period of time in the mid-nineties with a peculiar fondness, for it was the dawn of my full racial awakening! Sure I had always had a somewhat dim view of certain groups and certain ideas, but on the whole I was relatively young, idealistic and just as brainwashed and the next American idiot. But the events of the early Clinton years, the Oklahoma Militia fall-out and similar government shenanigans began a simultaneous curiosity in what was really going on with all these &#8220;extremists,&#8221; and a strong distrust of what the Powers That Be were up to. The rest just pretty much fell into place by about 1996 or so. Discovering AR online sometime thereafter was like a religious experience!</p>
<p>Yes, those were days of enlightenment for this American.</p>

		<p>I looked in vain for a first name for the &#8220;Morris&#8221; referred to in this article; I surmise it is &#8220;Dick&#8221; Morris, who has since left the Democrats and is working hard for the conservatives via Fox News and the publication of more of his books.  Even Dick couldn&rsquo;t stomach the Obama regime.  </p>
<p>Yes, the Tea Party folks are lumped under the &#8220;fascist&#8221; label by some people, with the blessings of the Democrats.  But increasingly, people are thinking more clearly, and see the folly of putting so many people in such a convenient and inaccurate little box.  This tactic will not work, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s Clinton, Morris, or Obama who&rsquo;s behind the scenes pushing it.  People seem to get smart inversely proportionally to the state of the economy - and given this, we&rsquo;re on the verge of producing a nation of geniuses, who will soon do away with these marxist foolish Democrats who have done so much to destroy this nation.</p>

<p>I firmly believe the Clinton administration, and especially President Clinton himself, sat on evidence that showed that the essence of the terrorism behind OKC came from AQ, OBL, and material help came from Ramzi Yousef.  The reason Clinton did it (I think) is because he was angling for a Nobel Peace Prize, so he wanted pander to Muslims and Islam, so that they could bargain with the Iraelis.  This is why the Clinton administration ignored the obvious plot to 9/11, which mostly took place when he was President.  This is why Jamie Gorelick, who was for all intents and purposes, the real AG in the Clinton admin, put up the infamous &#8220;wall&#8221; between foreign intelligence gathering and domestic intelligence gathering on the radical Islamic threat.</p>
<p>With the AQ/OBL stuff spiked, the Clintons (and Dick Morris) could then easily spin it as a project of the domestic right wing.  Which gave him a chance to bash Gingrich and Limbaugh, and the SPLC the golden opportunity to raise money.</p>
<p>There were two explosions at Murrah   &mdash;   The McV/Nichols concoction in a Ryder truck full of animal waste would have done essentially only cosmetic damage to a building as well constructed as Murrah, and it probably would have killed a few people.  As Ted Gunderson proved, the device that did the most damage was inside the building, and very sophisticated.  The only kind of institutions that could get/make such a device were (and still are) either governments, or trans-national organizations with big money.  What was Ramzi Yousef?  An explosives expert.  What was OBL?  Big money.  McV and Yousef were in the Phillippines at the same time in the year leading up to OKC; a number of credible witnesses have shown that.  </p>
<p>As an aside, one of the victims of OKC, who had a Federal job inside the Murrah Building, was someone high up in one of Willis Carto&rsquo;s organizations, the Liberty Lobby.  I know that b/c The Spotlight (which no longer exists) featured him on the front page on their first issue after OKC.  However, as this was a Federal building in a sizable city that has a sizable black population, most of the victims were black women, as most Federal employees in big cities are black women, thanks to that wonderful Ronald Reagan and his elimination of the PACE exam.</p>

		<p>I used to not care what happened at Waco because the Branch Davidians were a bizarre cult.  But I can&rsquo;t stand Clinton using the Oklahoma City tragedy to gain moral superiority because I no longer buy the government&rsquo;s line on Waco.  And Ruby Ridge too.  And I still can&rsquo;t forget the picture of a federal agent with a submachine gun pointed at Elian Gonzalez&rsquo;s uncle after they stormed the house where he was staying.  Not that I really want more Cubans here but I don&rsquo;t understand why the Feds did that.</p>

<p>I was reading about Mr. McV because of this story. The following quote is attributed to him,</p>
<p>&#8220;Taxes are a joke. Regardless of what a political candidate &#8220;promises,&#8221; they will increase. More taxes are always the answer to government mismanagement. They mess up. We suffer. Taxes are reaching cataclysmic levels, with no slowdown in sight&hellip; Is a Civil War Imminent? Do we have to shed blood to reform the current system? I hope it doesn&rsquo;t come to that. But it might&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what he&rsquo;s saying that&rsquo;s interesting, but the manner of delivery. There are folks working at the newspaper who couldn&rsquo;t write with such an active voice, with an air of this much authority, using such a punchy delivery. Nor can folks deep in the communist movement normally write this good. This from a corporal a couple years out of the Army and an unemployed security guard? Again, it&rsquo;s not what he&rsquo;s saying but the delivery. He certainly writing here better than anything I could write and I&rsquo;m middle aged and post every week on AmRen and have been writing since my days at college where I wrote for their newspaper.   </p>
<p>McV was anti-government, by way of what&rsquo;s attributed to him, so it&rsquo;s not a huge stretch to compare his rhetoric, at least, to that of the modern Tea Party.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more interesting, is that in &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; and politically-correct America, it&rsquo;s business as usual to paint whites or American or &#8216;corporate interests&rsquo; as being in bed with the devil, sometimes outrageous claims leading to conclusions completely opposite from reality, that&rsquo;s A-Ok and no one bats an eye (and is liable to win you some award for starters), but to tell the truth, why that&rsquo;s dangerous and &#8216;controversial&rsquo;. And in fact for the most part it isn&rsquo;t told.   </p>

		<p>The Left can only get away with this tactic because conservatism is too gutless and dishonest to stick the Left with responsibility for  the Left&rsquo;s chief form of political terrorism - sponsoring wholesale racist violence against whites.   It&rsquo;s as if Detroit happened in a social and political vacuum.   I&rsquo;ve pointed out to Lefties on the web that we&rsquo;ve had at least 2 incidences of black criminals mass-murdering cops since Obama has taken office, and you can bet that these black criminals have spent their lives soaking in the bile that the Liberal/non-white/Democrat coalition and the media spew 24/7 on white people.   Stick a microphone under these thugs noses and out comes a simplified version of what you will hear in any &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; course or seminar.   Since this Hutaree Militia hasn&rsquo;t yet produced the cop body count  that has lately been achieved by black criminals and radicals pumped full of hate by the Left (0 vs. at least 8) the level of outrage from the media can safely be labeled as phony.  </p>

		<p>   One of the major (somewhat liberally biased) educational networks did a recent show on the Oklahoma City bombing connecting both Tim and Terry to Muslims in the Philippines . Tim admits in his book, his sympathies for Muslims in the first Persian Gulf War, although he denies any connection . But knowing how militant Muslims operate, it would be easy to imagine why he would deny any connection . The FBI and the CIA had their warning with the &#8216;93 attack on the WTC, you can&rsquo;t get any more explicit than that . Knowing the WTC was the nerve center of the American economy and that was the reason it was targeted in the first place, they had to know the Muslims would be back . But as I recall, an FBI press release from that time said, &#8220;it&rsquo;s angry middle-aged whites with guns,&#8221; that they were concerned over instead of leftwingers like the Wethermen, SLA, the Panthers or Muslims . Oddly enough the FBI made another press release about that time stating,&#8221; because of our liberal immigration policy, the terrorist will eventually get through.&#8221; They obviously could predict it was coming, why no heads rolled after it happened is a mystery . But to hear of an administration trying to connect violence to the republicans is laughable when under that same administration &#8220;shotgun assisted suicides&#8221; became relatively common in the Beltway, and when they left office - the suicides came to an abrupt halt.David K may have been odd and even liberalist in our view, but he was also a comfortable fit with the &#8220;angry middle-aged whites with guns,&#8221; mindset of Federal Law Enforcement . That the FBI, ATF and Marshals had to admit to questionable activities both at Waco and Ruby Ridge should alarm anyone who loves America and liberty .As for Tim&rsquo;s and Terry&rsquo;s logic and motivation, unless there was a Muslim connection, or maybe even a liberal connection, I simply cannot even comprehend it from a conservative point of view.The attack just does not make any sense .   </p>

		<p>6 QD: I knew there was something wrong with the truck bomb story as soon as I saw the first photos of the OKC Federal Bldg.  A pressure wave&rsquo;s strength is inversely proportional to the distance it travels.  A concrete column 60 feet from the explosion receives only 1/4 the force of a column 30 feet from the blast.  Yet in the news photos you can easily see that one column near the crater still stands while another twice as far away has fallen.  I&rsquo;ve never seen an explanation for this in the MSM.  </p>

		<p>I seem to remember that ATF management called their employees and told them not to come in the day of the explosion.  </p>
<p>I also seem to remember that incriminating evidence against Hillary was stored in that building and destroyed in the explosion.  </p>

<p>The &#8220;connection&#8221; is even more nebulous than that.  Neither McV nor Terry Nichols ever was a part of one.  Nichols&rsquo;s brother, James, went to one&rsquo;s open forum, where he spouted off about how we didn&rsquo;t need drivers licenses.  And they didn&rsquo;t want him back, b/c of course we need driver licensure.  The state builds the roads and owns the right-of-way, so of course it can decides who and who cannot operate a motorized vehicle on it.  Personally, I think it&rsquo;s too easy to get a drivers&rsquo; license, and too hard to lose it.  The Missouri Department of Revenue office that serves the black half of St. Louis is infamous for giving out drivers licenses on a &#8220;wink wink&#8221; basis.</p>
<p>Late breaking news:  FBI document dump shows that a certain poverty center we all know and love was thickly involved in the run-up to OKC:  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2dfgey3" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2dfgey3</a></p>
<p>One more thing:  McV was executed barely six years after his crimes.  For a death penalty case, that is light speed.  The quickest I&rsquo;ve ever heard of a state death penalty being applied after the crime is 14 years.  Mumia Abu-Jamal is still consuming oxygen, 29 years after the crime.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for some good dead trees and ink re OKC, my recommendation is <i>Oklahoma City: Day One</i> by Michelle Moore.  It&rsquo;s free of political bias, and very detailed, by an Oklahoma City native, about what happened on April 19, 1995 and only that day in OKC.  From that book, I picked up the habit of paying attention to every media source I can when one of these spectacular events happens, so you can piece together pieces of a disparate puzzle, and pick up on media stories that they&rsquo;ll deny six months later of ever publishing.  That&rsquo;s what Moore did when OKC happened, with her local media. </p>

If you want a really great book on the Oklahoma City bombing try &#8220;The Third Terrorist&#8221;.  This book was written by Jayna Davis, a reported at the local Oklahoma City television station.  She was at the scene of the explosion within a few minutes of the bombing and interviewed a number of witnesses.  Several witnesses not only described a man that looked like McV but also another man who was seen running from the Ryder truck with McV. The second man looked like the description given to Davis by the witnesses  at the scene.</p>
<p>The newspapers the next day had TWO police drawings of the suspects.  One drawing looked like McV, the other drawing looked very different as the second man looked like he could have been Middle Eastern.  These two drawings went all over the country and I remember seeing them in my local newspaper.</p>
<p>The author claims that the first police descriptions over police radio described two men seen running from the truck.  Latter the story was changed. </p>

<p>Just another example of how the Left accusses their enemies of the very thing that they themselves are guilty of. This descripition sounds just like Leftist of the past decades, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>So right you are. That fact was on either an ABC or Discovery channel news program long ago, if my memory serves me correct. The program said that the truck bomb would have done little damage in comparison to what happened. There must have been charges placed on the support structures INSIDE the building.</p>
<p>As well, remember the suspect that they were looking for other than TimMcV&hellip;a dark-skinned arab&hellip;I forget the official term (John Doe #2?), but there was a Middle-Eastern connection. Journalist Jayna Davis, in her book &#8220;The Third Terrorist&#8221;, linked Iraqi ex-POWs to the bombing, along with the official perps. (I tried to read that book, but the description of the bombing and loss of life was too much for me, I had to put it down.) She also had a very hard time getting anyone in the FBI to listen to her or pay any attention to the evidence she gathered. Clinton had to have his &#8220;legacy&#8221; of a Middle-Eastern peace accord, the fact that we had been attacked by Middle-Eastern interests be damned. That is also why the investigation of TWA Flight 800 was spiked, too.</p>

		<p>P.S. - by the time Clinton left office, how many times had we been hit by Middle-Eastern Muslims? &#8216;93 WTC bombing, OKC, the Cole bombing, embassy bombings, TWA Fight 800&hellip;did I leave any out? And what did Clinton do? Drop a bomb on an aspirin factory. He didn&rsquo;t even go after OBL, &#8216;cause that was &#8220;too risky&#8221;.</p>

<p>You include TWA 800 as an act of terrorism.  At first, the regime denied that it was terrorism, and even threw someone in Federal prison for having absconded with a square inch of the wreckage.  But after 9/11, Al Gore was giving his condolences to the victims of past acts of terrorism, and included TWA 800 as one of those.</p>

		<p>I think there was a Middle-Eastern connection, for the simple reason that the &#8220;John Doe Number Two&#8221; suspect seen with McV is the spitting image of &#8220;dirty bomb&#8221; suspect Jose Padilla, who became a Muslim and spent time in one &#8220;terrorist state&#8221; or another before returning to the US.  Both McV and Padilla lived in Plantation, Florida in 1992-93, and at this time Padilla converted to Islam and began an association with Benevolence International&rsquo;s Adham Hassoun, a Palestinian activist and known al-Qaida recruiter.  Hassoun was also connected with Al-Gama Al-Islamiyya, a terrorist group tied to the New York-based al-Qaida cell headed by Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman that committed the World Trade Center bombings in 1993.  Al-Gama Al-Islamiyya also committed the Luxor massacre of 58 foreign tourists in Egypt in 1997.  Shortly before the OKC bombing, Timothy McV and Terry Nichols both travelled in the Chicago area where the Benevolence International Foundation was based.  Padilla, already a known associate of the foundation, had been raised in Chicago and still had a son there.  None of this adds up completely to &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; quality evidence, but it&rsquo;s pretty convincing that there was in fact a Middle-Eastern Islamic link to the OK City bombing.</p>

		<p>   Several of the post cast a lot of doubt on whether or not we can trust the official news story on events like these . A point well taken . I for one will always believe there was a Muslim connection with the anthrax mailings . Even though our own government has worked relentlessly to convince us otherwise . My family and I were in Daytona Beach in &#8216;99 . An Arab girl working at Woolworths was caught swiping credit cards into her own card reader . Someone tried to withdraw 1200 bucks on my card, The trail ran from the Florida state line up into Tennesee . W U alerted me . When I called the Atlanta number involved, no one there spoke English or at least would not admit to it . Soon after 9-11 we started getting hand wriiten appeals for charity from Ormond Beach, each with a cheap pewter trinket in it with some powder residue . I threw them away . Then we recieved a handwritten appeal for charity from the Philippines . Block print that trailed downward toward the bottom right corner of the envelope&hellip;? Just like the anthrax letters . I turned that one over to the Sheriff Dept . This is a small town, it was wasted effort . I guess my point is, we know the terrorist were entrenched in Florida . There was a loose connection with the tabloid the first victim worked for . I find it odd that he was in NC right about the time the letters first appeared . That is not that far from NJ by interstate highway . Or perhaps the letters were turned over to someone else in NC . The anthrax was in his office, in his car . I am not accusing, but I cannot help but wonder if in some way the man may have been duped .The general consensus in liberal Florida was that the terrorist were just a group of &#8220;nice boys.&#8221;</p>

		<p>A 20-foot Ryder truck (or was it?) full of fertilizer and fuel oil took out the Murrah Building and created a 30-foot crater?</p>
<p>QD writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;There were two explosions at Murrah&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Or perhaps three: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;An analysis of raw news footage and reports in the immediate aftermath of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, Okla., shows local television reporters stating repeatedly that two additional, sophisticated, undetonated explosive devices were found by investigators on the scene.</p>
<p>Also, reporters at the scene confirmed that the two other bombs were larger than the first one, and that the bomb that had exploded blew up inside   &mdash;   not outside   &mdash;   the building.</p>
<p>Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating also confirmed the presence of other explosives.</p>
<p>&#8216;The reports I have are that one device was deactivated &hellip; [and] apparently, there was another device. Whatever did the damage to the Murrah building was a tremendous &hellip; a very sophisticated explosive device. &hellip;&rsquo; Keating was heard saying.</p>
<p>A Department of Defense Atlantic Command memo, issued one day after the bombing, says &#8220;&hellip; a second bomb was disarmed; a third bomb was evacuated.</p>
<p> The Murrah building was demolished two weeks after the attack; the site was covered with dirt and the building materials were trucked to an off-site dump manned by armed guards and buried&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Later:</p>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY – Long-secret security tapes showing the chaos immediately after the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building are blank in the minutes before the blast and appear to have been edited  said Jesse Trentadue, a Salt Lake City attorney who obtained the recordings through the federal Freedom of Information Act as part of an unofficial inquiry he is conducting.</p>
<p>I suppose we&rsquo;ll never know the truth of the matter  &mdash;  there are all kinds of theories out there (many of them entirely plausible) linking the OK bombing to Bin Ladin, Iraq, Iran, the USG, the Mossad, Al Quaida (or whatever the spelling)  &mdash;  anyone and anything except the two White front men who took the full blame.</p>
<p>And, there are also many unanswered questions as to Elohim City, connections to the obnoxious morris dees and the mysterious death of JD Cash.</p>
<p>Fascinating to say the least.</p>
