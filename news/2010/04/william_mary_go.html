			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), April 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The selection of the mythical monster with the body of a lion and the head, wings and claws of a lion was announced Tuesday by President Taylor Reveley at an event on the Williamsburg campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>William and Mary began searching for a mascot after the NCAA ruled that the university&rsquo;s green and gold feather logo could be offensive to Native Americans.</p>
<p>William &amp; Mary for decades was known as the Indians. {snip}</p>

		<p>Considering their name I don&rsquo;t know why William &amp; Mary doesn&rsquo;t use the name &#8220;Royals.&#8221;  They can&rsquo;t go with &#8220;Monarchs&#8221; because that&rsquo;s the name Old Dominion University which I attended uses.  They started out as the Norfolk branch of W &amp; M.</p>

		<p>So they&rsquo;re wiping every trace of the fact that Native Americans once inhabited this land from the national consciousness? How does that improve things? Native Americans can&rsquo;t be depicted in cartoons, song, film, dance, or as team mascots. So should whites forget that Native Americans even exist? That seems to be the message here. I&rsquo;m sure in a few years the activists will be complaining that Native Americans are an &#8220;invisible minority&#8221; and must be depicted MORE! And so the cycle goes&hellip;</p>

		<p> Now isn&rsquo;t that just great. I wish the administration had some cojones and would have told those busybodies to mind their own business. Too bad if it is perceived to offend some people. There will always be someone who is offended by any one thing. Well, W&M; is a liberal college.</p>

		<p>As a Native American, I am offended by the &#8216;Griffin&rsquo; (OK, I&rsquo;m only descended from a couple of &#8216;Indian Princesses&rsquo;, but in the world of Offense-Mongering substantive reality is of only tertiary importance).</p>
<p>Anyone who grew up reading the right magazines (as presumably do William &amp; Mary types) knows that the preferred spelling of the winged leonine grotesque is &#8216;Griffon&rsquo;&hellip;with an &#8216;O&rsquo;.  &#8216;Griffin&rsquo; is just not nice.</p>
<p>It is inconceivable to me that I should be offended by a logo which includes feathers.  Moreover, I seem to remember both feathers and Griffons figuring prominently in the world of Heraldic paraphernalia.  If feathers are not considered demeaning when used as symbolism for the ancient and modern royal houses of Europe, then why should they demean when used as a reference to Native Americans?</p>
<p>However, as someone who grew up with furniture whose arms were supported by Griffons, I am most visibly upset by the downmarket spelling proposed by William &amp; Mary, and feel a lawsuit coming on.</p>

		<p>William and Mary college is named for their royal sponsors King William and Queen Mary of England.  The Griffin is a traditional Welsh Emblem and is in fact on the Welsh flag.  If you want to get rid of foreign influences, better change the name of the college.</p>
<p>As for Amerinds, they strike me of shooting themselves in the foot everytime since the beginning when whites starting recording the history of Amerind activities on this continent.  The reason they don&rsquo;t want emblems depicting them is simply reactive hatred of whites, and an assumption that any depiction by whites is not honorable.  That&rsquo;s how much they hate us.</p>

		<p>Without a picture, it sounds as if they have chosen the hereditary symbol of Iraq as a mascot.</p>

		<p>Here is an interesting thing.  The association of American Indians with nobility, warriorship and spirituality, have basically disappeared.  They were, of course, a racist fantasy.</p>
<p>So, it has been replaced with a symbol of white nationalism, lol.  In the interests of turning away from racism.</p>
<p>The irony is pretty thick here.  A positive racist stereotype is abandoned at the behest of crazy political correctness (that are responsible for the creation of that stereotype, I might add) to be replaced, mostly out of ignorance) with a symbol historically used by white nations.  Something that would freak the PC types out, if they understood the significance.</p>
<p><br>
Unintentionally hilarious.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Tim in Indiana&#8221; That is an interesting observation. It does seem as though the self-appointed ayatollas of Political Correctness may have overplayed their hand with this war on all things &#8220;Native American&#8221; and offensive. Typical of how the left operates, actually. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d bet that, given a choice, the students would have voted for Darth Vader.  Every bit as meaningful as a griffon, and much more familiar.</p>

		<p>Good.</p>
<p>WM was founded by English settlers in 1693. Not that much earlier in 1622 and again in 1644 the English were almost wiped off the continent in Indian massacres. </p>
<p>Why should the college associate itself with people who tried to exterminate its founders?</p>
<p>I for one think it is appropriate that the college adopt a historical symbol used in the UK, although I am fully aware that the college has done so not to honor its British heritage but rather for cowardly leftist reasons.</p>

		<p>I guess I&rsquo;m strange, but I thought that naming an athletic team after someone/something actually denoted some honor to that namesake. It is meant to imply that the team is strong, honorable, and worthy of respect. After all, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to name a team the Wausau Wimps, right?  There goes that &#8220;Offending in the First Degree&#8221; again.</p>
