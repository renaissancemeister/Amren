<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html">Ending the Slavery Blame-Game</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., New York Times, April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While we are all familiar with the role played by the United States and the European colonial powers like Britain, France, Holland, Portugal and Spain, there is very little discussion of the role Africans themselves played. And that role, it turns out, was a considerable one, especially for the slave-trading kingdoms of western and central Africa. These included the Akan of the kingdom of Asante in what is now Ghana, the Fon of Dahomey (now Benin), the Mbundu of Ndongo in modern Angola and the Kongo of today&rsquo;s Congo, among several others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that 90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Middle Passage, in other words, was sometimes a two-way street. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to claim that Africans were ignorant or innocent.</p>
<p>Given this remarkably messy history, the problem with reparations may not be so much whether they are a good idea or deciding who would get them; the larger question just might be from whom they would be extracted.</p>

		<p>Dr. Gates deserves a lot of respect for what he has written there.</p>
<p>The idea of reparations is nonsense, of course (are the sons supposed to take the blame for the sins of their fathers?)   &mdash;   but very right of Gates to point out the roles of Africans in the enslavement of their fellow Africans.  Very right, indeed.</p>

<p>In any discussion of &#8220;reparations,&#8221; the enslavement of blacks by blacks right here in our ante-bellum south should be brought up. It absolutely drives people crazy when they find out that there were black slave owners right here in our south. Some liberal say that had to do with them buying family members out of slavery and yes that did happen. But there were blacks who used slaves just as the White and American Indians did, as workers. Oh yes, don&rsquo;t forget that bit about American Indians owning blacks as well. </p>
<p>A very interesting subject.</p>

		<p>Africans did not stop enslaving their own people until the 1990&rsquo;s. The muslims are still doing it today, on the sly. They are still using the old slave routes to the Arabian peninsula.<br>
I believe Mauritainia was the last country to outlaw slavery.</p>

		<p>In reading the entire article, it becomes apparent that Gate&rsquo;s only reason for admitting black African complicity in the slave trade is that, by making some verbal concessions, he thinks it will make it easier for blacks to negotiate &#8220;reparations&#8221; from white society. He does NOT think it invalidates blacks&rsquo; claims to reparations in the first place. Let the handouts commence!</p>

		<p>While he was at it, did Skipper go on and tell us about Black free men and Indians (Native Americans) who owned Black slaves in the U.S. prior to 1865? </p>
<p>How about Italians in the U.S. whose ancestors date back only to 1891 here? How about Zamba Brazilians living in Newark, NJ whose great grandfathers released their last slaves in 1886?</p>
<p>What about contemporary Mestizos who are carrying the blood of Friar Bartólome De Las Casas, Hernán Cortez, and Portuguese slavers?</p>

		<p>Dr. Gates did a lot of research not only of his family but families of famous blacks whose ancestors were slaves in the South. What he found out shocked many of these people when they found that many of the slaves were professional people,masons, bridge builders etc. many were allowed to marry and live away from the plantation.It is amazing what a little research will do to your thinking</p>

		<p>About 2% of the Africans removed from that continent as slaves came to what is now the USA.  Their descendants are now the most prosperous blacks on earth.  If you want to discuss who &#8220;owes&#8221; African descendants, start with Brazil and Arabia.</p>

		<p>Anyone with even a moderate knowledge of history will know that slavery was nothing new or unique when the first European settlers arrived. It was even quite common in the New World. I have never come across any society in antiquity that did not practice slavery to one degree or another. </p>
<p>Blacks have been fed the pablum that their ancestor&rsquo;s suffering was somehow unique and that Whites are uniquely evil. Too bad few modern scholars will objectively demolish the myth of special black suffering. </p>
<p>And make sure you let your neighbors and co-workers know that Western Civilization is the first to voluntarily abandon slavery. </p>

		<p>I agree with Tim.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates is throwing whites a bone in the hope that whites will snap it up and confess their guilt and open their wallets.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates makes it clear that his argument is FOR reparations. He asks &#8220;from whom they would be extracted&#8221; but we know the answer. American blacks aren&rsquo;t going to pay for the historic guilt of their ancestors and besides, they don&rsquo;t have the money (the very reason for reparations). Africans aren&rsquo;t generating wealth so the only money they have is what we give them.</p>
<p>Who is the only one left to pay?</p>
<p>What Mr. Gates is essentially saying is, &#8216;yes, we&rsquo;re all guilty but those who have the money should pay for everyones sins&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I suspect whites are going to take the bait and fall into the trap.</p>
<p>PS: In his series, &#8216;The Wonders of the African World&rsquo;, Mr. Gates confronted Africans who participated in enslaving their own people and although they admit what they did, they don&rsquo;t have any collective guilt for what their ancestors did.</p>

		<p>Of course the race-hustlers in this country would have everyone believe a bunch of white guys were running around in the African bush rounding up their ancestors and packing them off to servitude. The fact black Africans themselves were involved in the round up and sale isn&rsquo;t allowed to enter the equation. In fact some of these same rabble-rousing race-baiters may have had ancestors who were the slave wranglers and sellers themselves.</p>

		<p>Some of the comments mention reparations for slavery. We are paying reparations, right now  &mdash;  enormous sums. Think of the budget for welfare, for section 8 housing, for food stamps, for security measures in our public schools, for education policies like NCLB, for the shoplifting cameras in our malls, for food banks, for bloated urban police departments, for EEOC oversight of our labor markets, for lost white opportunities due to affirmative action, for remedial education in our colleges, for an enormous archipelago of prisons, for the stress of fearing every strutting  dread-locked thug  &mdash;  -we are paying, and paying, and paying.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s one half of the story that isn&rsquo;t being told.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about time someone brought forth that little inconvenient truth, that blacks sold other blacks into slavery in Africa in the 1600&rsquo;s, 1700&rsquo;s, and 1800&rsquo;s.  I suggest to any and all American blacks who are trying to get something for nothing (reparations), that they go and try to get said reparations out of the various African nations that enslaved their people originally.  The fact is, it won&rsquo;t work there any more than it will work here (over my dead body).  Blacks better get used to the idea that reparations are like a puff of smoke in the wind.  No power, nothing tangible, and no lasting significance.</p>

		<p>Good points made here.  One point that was forgotten was the reparations already given through welfare, food stamps and government jobs.</p>
<p>Also, since reparations are being considered into antiquity whom do I see regarding my ancestors who were enslavd by the Romans in 65 BC?  Do you think the current Italian government will entertain my claim?</p>

		<p>With all of this hoo-hah that has been going on about slavery (for a long time now) the people that have got away scot-free from blame are the Arabs and the Chinese.<br>
The above two are never ever mentioned in any discussion about slavery. A person would think that slavery started up in the 1700s (by horrible English people) then went on to be solely the domain of horrible Americans.<br>

		<p>Historical facts  are  historical  facts, thus  they  should be accepted  without  any  cosmetic  varnish. Here  are the  facts.</p>
<p>1)West European  sailed  to  Africa  looking  for  labor power for the  Americas that  was  lost when  Spanish  priest Bartolomo de las  Casas recommended  that  Africans replace Native American  slaves  &mdash;  already  enslaved for  100  years  by  the  Spaniards.</p>
<p>2)Africans  did  not  sail  to  Europe advertising  their war  captives for forced labor  enslavement.</p>
<p>3)There  was  massive demand  for labor for the  European  colonies in the  Americas, and  like  anything  else in  life, demand creates its  own  supply[think of the murderous  drug trade]. Thus  the Africans  who were  engaged in  the  trade were simply  pawns in a game  that was  much  bigger  than  they  understood. First, Afro-Portugese[lanzados]were employed  to go  far upcountry  to  bargain  with  weapons, alcohol and  other  trade  goods to procure the  war prisoners. Second, the African kings who  participated  in  the  trade were really economic victims  of the  trade because if they  knew  the full  returns on  the  investments of the  slavers  they  would have sought  to  control the  market for themselves  even to  the  extent of even  to the  extent of  employing the  war  captives to produce the  tobacco, cotton and  sugar that  made  the  European  planters  in  the  Americas  wealthy.</p>
<p>4)In terms  of the  blame  game one  should  recognise that the  ultimate  moral responsibility  lay  with  the  last  recipients of the  war  prisoners.  They  could  have been bought  to  be  set  free, or  be  set  up  as  pampered  servants of the  European  nobility[it did  happen  in a  few  cases],  or  to  put on fine  beds to  be  pampered  for the  rest  of their  lives.  They  were not  &mdash;  and  history  has  all  the details as  to  how  they  were  treated  and  how  they  responded. </p>
<p>5)The puzzling thing  though  is  that why the  descendants of the  captives who  suffered  mightily  at  the  hands of their  captors would ever  believe  that the  descendants  of their  ertswhile planatation  and extra-plantation  tormentors would ever want  to  compensate  them  for wrongs  committed against  them. Human beings have  shown  themselves throughout  history  to  more prone to cruelty and moral depravity than  to moral magnanimity  &mdash;  so  why  expect them  to  be any  different  now?</p>

		<p>How can a group be owed reparations because their ancestors were brought to a country that has allowed them to enjoy the highest standard of living of all their racial cousins throughout the world?</p>
<p>If their demand is that they be returned to the place and conditions from which their ancestors were taken, I&rsquo;m sure the majority of America would heartily support such an initiative, even offering them first class airfare to the African locale of their choice.</p>

		<p>While it&rsquo;s true that black Africans owned slaves and also &#8220;sold out&#8221; their kinsmen to white slave traders, what is ultimately being scrutinized is the enslavement of one race by -another- race. In this case, white people owning black slaves. Since it was relatively recent in history, it remains in the collective memory of blacks; so the dogged persistence of references to slavery shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprising. </p>
<p>Even though only a small fraction of Whites ever owned slaves, the act was so offensive that it resulted in ubiquitous white guilt. It&rsquo;s also true that Whites freed blacks from slavery, however, the effects of this goodwill was eroded by black societal discrimination in its aftermath.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Whites owned black slaves -&gt; Whites free black slaves -&gt; effects of black discrimination outweigh accommodations made -&gt; white guilt and black anger persist -&gt; White guilt cathartic release by electing black president</p>

<p>1) &ldquo;West European sailed to Africa looking for labor power for the Americas that was lost when Spanish priest Bartolomo de las Casas recommended that Africans replace Native American slaves &mdash; already enslaved for 100 years by the Spaniards&rdquo;.<br>
Africans made good slaves. Native Americans were too proud and Whites would easily rebel. When slavery was abolished Asian labourers were brought in from places like India because blacks were too lazy when freed.<br>
2) &ldquo;Africans did not sail to Europe advertising their war captives for forced labor enslavement.&rdquo;<br>
Black Africans could never sail to Europe for anything let alone for advertisement as they were too primitive to build appropriate vessels.<br>
3) &ldquo;There was massive demand for labor for the European colonies in the Americas, and like anything else in life, demand creates its own supply[think of the murderous drug trade]. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;ims of the trade because if they knew the full returns on the investments of the slavers they would have sought to control the market for themselves even to the extent of even to the extent of employing the war captives to produce the tobacco, cotton and sugar that made the European planters in the Americas wealthy.&rdquo;<br>
Most of those slaves would have died a horrible death or would have been eaten alive anyways. The chiefs were smart enough to sell them for goods their primitive societies could never manufacture. Most of those chiefs did not give a damn about the people they were selling. Only a tiny number of European planters became wealthy, about 97% of Whites today are not their descendants. White nations became prosperous because thanks to their high IQ, they invented modern technology. Blacks have nothing to do with it.<br>
4) &ldquo;In terms of the blame game one should recognise that the ultimate moral responsibility &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. or to put on fine beds to be pampered for the rest of their lives. They were not &mdash; and history has all the details as to how they were treated and how they responded.&rdquo;<br>
Why should Europeans pamper Africans? And who cares about morality, Europeans were stronger and more intelligent and did what they did. No civilization in history banned slavery except Western civilization. Many British soldiers and sailors gave their lives to stop the slave trade while African chiefs wanted it to continue. And as far as setting African slaves free, V.S. Naipaul wrote of a case where black slaves enslaved by Arabs were set free by French Christian missionaries. They were encouraged to set up villages and start a new life. The Arabs did not think it was a wise idea as these blacks were from the interior and unfamiliar with the new land. After some months when the missionaries checked them out, the entire village was deserted as the local blacks had enslaved them all.<br>
5) &ldquo;The puzzling thing though is that why the descendants of the captives who suffered mightily at the hands of their captors would ever believe that the descendants of their ertswhile planatation and extra-plantation tormentors would ever want to compensate them for wrongs committed against them. Human beings have shown themselves throughout history to more prone to cruelty and moral depravity than to moral magnanimity &mdash; so why expect them to be any different now?&rdquo;<br>
The captives never suffered much and were well treated. Their descendants have got a chance to participate in an advanced civilization which they were incapable to develop on their own and have done everything to wreck it. Maybe the Whites should be paid compensation for tolerating them in their nation and for all the damages suffered by White America at the hands of this destructive people. Besides if Whites are such bad people, why are Africans dying to come to White lands while blacks living in America are hardly fleeing evil Whitey to live with their African brothers. <br>

OCCAM: <i> West European sailed to Africa looking for labor power for the Americas that was lost when Spanish priest Bartolomo de las Casas recommended that Africans replace Native American slaves &mdash; already enslaved for 100 years by the Spaniards.<br>
Africans did not sail to Europe advertising their war captives for forced labor enslavement. </i><br>
 <br>
The African slave trade had existed for centuries before the Europeans ever became involved in it, with almost all the slaves going to North Africa and the Middle East. In addition to millions of African slaves, the Arabs took millions of Europeans into slavery as well. Like the Africans, most of the European slaves were war captives and victims of raiders looking for booty and slaves. Unlike Africa, the Muslims raided Christian shipping and coastal towns directly taking about a million Europeans into slavery. The largest slave-owning and slave-trading civilization of human history is most likely the Arab-Islamic civilization of that area.</p>
<p>OCCAM:  <i>There was massive demand for labor for the European colonies in the Americas, and like anything else in life, demand creates its own supply[think of the murderous drug trade]. Thus the Africans who were engaged in the trade were simply pawns in a game that was much bigger than they understood. First, Afro-Portugese[lanzados]were employed to go far upcountry to bargain with weapons, alcohol and other trade goods to procure the war prisoners. Second, the African kings who participated in the trade were really economic victims of the trade because if they knew the full returns on the investments of the slavers they would have sought to control the market for themselves even to the extent of even to the extent of employing the war captives to produce the tobacco, cotton and sugar that made the European planters in the Americas wealthy. </i></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, African slavers were victims. I really believe that.</p>
<p>This does nothing to explain why Africans sold each other into slavery to the Arabs for half a millennium before the Europeans took slaves from Africa. As I have already pointed out, the Europeans didn&rsquo;t create the slave market, they merely took advantage of a market the Africans had already created themselves.<br>
 <br>
The Africans sold each other into slavery because they hated each other, not because  they were economic victims of the Europeans.<br>
  <br>
And Africans didn&rsquo;t fail to produce goods such as tobacco, sugar and cotton on a mass scale because Europeans withheld the secret from them. They failed to achieve mass production of goods because their tribalistic cultures were too primitive to develop the sophisticated social, economic and political institutions which make such production possible.</p>
<p>OCCAM: <i> In terms of the blame game one should recognise that the ultimate moral responsibility lay with the last recipients of the war prisoners. </i></p>
<p>Nonsense. A receiver of stolen goods is not ultimately (by which you really mean solely) responsible for the theft of the goods, and addicts who buy heroin are not solely responsible for its manufacture and sale.<br>
 <br>
OCCAM: <i>The puzzling thing though is that why the descendants of the captives who suffered mightily at the hands of their captors would ever believe that the descendants of their ertswhile planatation and extra-plantation tormentors would ever want to compensate them for wrongs committed against them. </i></p>
<p>Well, here you&rsquo;re entirely right. Proponents of slavery reparations want people who never owned slaves to pay reparations to people who never were slaves. The moral logic is bizarre.</p>
<p>Your views only makes sense if you&rsquo;re determined to believe in the blue-eyed devil theory of history. </p>

<p>Ubiquitous white guilt, you say?  I feel no guilt whatever for something that happened nearly two hundred years ago, especially considering the benefits realized by the descendants of those brought here in bondage.  </p>
<p>I do feel anger, resentment, and frustration at the enormous costs these black African slave descendants impose on all other Americans, directly and indirectly. And quite honestly I can imagine that they&rsquo;re frustrated as well. Imagine being in a country in which you know, deep down, that you can&rsquo;t compete with whites and Asians.  Blacks aren&rsquo;t so intellectually handicapped that they can&rsquo;t realize that there&rsquo;s an intellectual gulf between them and other races, just as I can realize and acknowledge that there&rsquo;s an intellectual gulf between me and your average nuclear physicist. But I take comfort that at least I&rsquo;m somewhere in the mainstream.  Blacks, as a group, can take no such comfort.</p>
<p>Bringing them to our shores, or at least failing to return them to Africa after the Civil War (however economically reasonable it might have seemed then), likely will turn out to be the greatest political and social mistake this country ever made.  Given the current occupant of the White House, perhaps that&rsquo;s a judgment we can already make.</p>

		<p>&#8220;African slavery was totally different because slaves got to keep their own names and were treated incredibly well by rival tribes.&#8221;  </p>
<p>What an idiotic statement.  Yes, in some cases, African slave owners did not treat their African slaves with brutality.  However, they usually did, the same way that they do today.  Look up the case histories of Black slaves in Black (primarily Islamic) Africa today   &mdash;   brutal treatment, punishment, starvation, constant, repeated rape, &amp; mutilation are very, very common.  </p>
<p>There are historical records of African tribes keeping captured &#8220;slaves&#8221; around for food.  Every few days they would cut off another arm or leg and cook and eat such, in front of the &#8220;slave.&#8221;  They did not have refrigeration until White men came, and thus the best way to keep meat fresh, was to keep the human-food alive.  This custom was developed totally before contact with Europeans, and Europeans were horrified when they discovered it.  </p>

		<p>As anyone who really studies history knows, slavery in America was almost at its NATURAL end when the North invaded the South in 1861. </p>
<p>The Radical Republicans had to push for change before they lost the only miniscule reason they had concocted for said change, which in effect began the transformation of our country from the one created by the Constitution into a Marxist state.</p>
<p>The spectre of slavery is all that kept the British and French from intervening on behalf of the South. Their own nations suffered the same fate as ours by staying out of it.</p>
<p>Slavery was almost done in any case and was smoothly replaced by sharecropping. </p>

		<p>I think I deserve reparations, too.  I have Irish heritage and there was an Irish potato famine, so someone owes me potatoes, even if I never starved.  Because of my Choctaw and Cherokee heritage the U.S. government owes me a tract of land; property in Oklahoma or Texas will do.  It gets tricky from here: England invaded Scotland a long time ago, and Germany invaded France during WWII. Since I have Scottish, English, French, and German heritage, I think I might owe myself reparations.  All I know is that someone who has never harmed me must certainly pay me off for something that didn&rsquo;t happen to me.  </p>

		<p>I think this &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Gates has an angle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if any are you are familiar with the nationally syndicated black talk radio host, one Bob Law.  His show exists on an on again off again basis in St. Louis, currently off.  I was listening to him and his guest one night about nine years ago.  The guest was a reparations advocate, although this one had a caveat:  He told Law that, if the average black person received a reparations check in the mail, he or she would be so traumatized upon seeing it, and so many subconsciously repressed memories from the horrors of slavery would rush up to the conscious level, that they would react irrationally by wasting the money on Nikes and bling.  (Which is about the stupidest rationalization I&rsquo;ve ever heard.)  Instead, the guest said, any reparations money (he said the bill would be in the &#8220;fourteen figure range,&#8221; i.e. between $10 trillion and $99 trillion), should be diverted into a &#8220;black nation building fund,&#8221; which would be the exclusive province of &#8220;black intellectuals.&#8221;  In other words, fools like this Gates, and also other sundry kooks like Cornell West, Angela Davis, et al.  They would spend these tens of trillions of dollars on each other.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see much chance of that actually happening.   No one (meaning blacks) would want it   &mdash;    except those  (ahem) &#8220;black intellectuals&#8221;.  I do agree that they certainly have their black brothers figures correctly, though.</p>
<p>Assuming that reparations happened, such a proposal would be shot down by the black masses, if they get their way.  They, as always, want the money NOW,  and QUICK!, right up front, so they can go right out and spend it.   They can&rsquo;t hold onto a dime until tomorrow.  They would have themselves a marvelous ghetto  party   &mdash;   for a brief time   &mdash;   and then it would be all over.   Then  back to the welfare line and looking for more handouts.</p>

<p>There are several issues here.  First, many of us are ethnic and race realists.  That is we know Black underachievement has some endogenous causes. As such, we see Affirmative Action as a form of reparation. And, in fact, it was sold as such.  For example in Fullilove v. Klutznick (1980), Justice Stevens argued that Affirmative Action was owed to Blacks by virtue of &#8220;dragged to this country in chains to be sold in slavery.&#8221;  So please subtract out of what you think is your due, all that has been paid. If you would like to discuss some of the causes, I would be happy to. Second, ideas of reparations is based one of two ways of thinking, a Libertarian frame, or 2) a group-collectivist frame.  With regards to the former refer to Walter Block&rsquo;s &#8220;On Reparations to Blacks for Slavery.&#8221; (2002).  In short, you have to go collect from who specifically owes you   &mdash;   so go break out your genealogical records and track down the descendants of your ancestors slavers   &mdash;   which might include you.  With regards to the later, speaking of what African-Americans are owed only makes sense is you talk about collective racial desert and obligation. So if you are willing to accept that European-Americans have collective rights, desert, and inheritance, based on collective racial identity, and you are willing to speak about this   &mdash;   I think many of us would be willing to play ball.          <br>

&#8220;1)Native Americans were indeed enslaved by the Spaniards for at least 100 years. It was not their pride that set them free, but Spanish priest Bartolomo de las Casas, who wanted them for conversion and had sympathy for them as they were being decimated right and left by the Spaniards.&#8221;</p>
<p>  That still does not prove that psychologically Native Americans were not fit for slavery. Those 100 years must have taught them that Native Americans just did not make good slaves. There was a saying in colonial times about how the Native American resisted and perished while blacks submitted and survived or something of that sort. That also explains why Asians were never brought in during the days of slavery but were the labourers of choice once slavery was abolished.</p>
<p>&#8220;2] Real slavery(the word &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; derives from &ldquo;Slav&rdquo; give the large numbers of them being enslaved locally and for export in the Slavic lands) existed in Europe for a much longer time than in Africa.&#8221;<br>
No denying that slavery existed in Europe (which removes the uniqueness of the suffering of the African slave), but there is a very good chance that slavery existed in Africa from even earlier times. Indeed slavery seems like an important part of the traditional African way of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;3)Domestic slavery in Africa was more like bonded servantship than anything else. It was qualitatively and quantitatively very different from the capitalism-driven chattel slavery of the Americas, South Africa, Cape Verde, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>  There is no proof of this non-sense. Indeed there is reason to believe from writings of travellers in Africa of extreme brutality in African society.</p>
<p>&#8220;4)Although blacks were slaves in the tent households of dissolute and lazy Arabs most of the slaves of the &ldquo;Arabs&rdquo; &mdash; a very broad term that includes any one who happens to speak Arabic or is even Turk or Persian &mdash; most of the slaves of the North African and West Asian Muslims were of European stock &mdash; especially white women in constant demand for harem work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another lie, Blacks made up a big part of the Arab slave business and many black women were sexually abused by their Arab lords. Indeed it is believed that more blacks died in the Arab slave trade than the European one. Unlike the helpless blacks, Europeans gave a good fight to the Islamic hordes and after repeated attempts most of Europe never came under their rule. </p>
<p>Finally,<br>
In the powerful Islamic kingdom of Sind (in present day Pakistan), blacks slaves were treated brutally. This until the armies of Sind were defeated by the soldiers of a new rising empire. Sind was conquered and incorporated into the growing empire. One of the first laws passed by the new rulers gave freedom and equality under the law to those black slaves (called Zanj or Habsis). Those benevolent conquerors were the White British. The descendants of those slaves still live in Karachi and still discriminated against by Pakistani society. When will black people ask Pakistan for compensation and thank Britain for their past benevolence?<br>

		<p>Occam,</p>
<p>1) Slavery existed in Meso-America prior to European contact. In North America, where no written languages existed pre-contact, the situation is less clear, but when the Europeans arrived several native groups already had some form of slave labor or another. See the tribes of the Pacific Northwest for an example. </p>
<p>2) The notion that slavery existed in Europe for a longer period than Africa is deceptive. Other than Egypt, Europe has had a history and written languages far longer than Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa was an unknown quantity to the Greeks and Romans. Black Africa had no written language so practically nothing is known prior to the introduction of Islam. Oh, and the Egyptians certainly had slavery and took captives in war. </p>
<p>3) The supposedly benign nature of slavery in AFrica may be true in some cases, but it is not known how great the slaves had it since they could neither read nor write. So no slave narratives from them. Several African kingdoms, Dahomey, Ashanti, etc became so rich off of the Atlantic slave trade that they resisted strongly against its abolition. </p>
<p>4) North African Muslim raiders captured thousands of European slaves from as far away as Ireland in the 16th-17th century. Sometimes whole communities were captured. Muslims also like little boys in their harems. See the Jannisaries. The slave trade in East Africa persisted for decades after the Atlantic slave trade was abolished. This trade was directly carried out by Muslim raiders who cut out the middleman. </p>
<p>5) And besides Africa, the Middle East, the Americas, and Europe, slavery was also practiced in one form or another throughout Asia. Prior to 1807, slavery appears as an almost universal institution in one variety or another-from debt slavery and prostitution all the way through the enslavement of war captives or convicts. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And finally-As pointed out above, Slavery in Mauretania was not officially abolished until 2007. Slavery has recently been reported in Chad, Mali, Niger, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Ethiopia. </p>
<p>African suffering is not unique and Whites should not feel especially guilty about it. </p>

<p>In the English colonies, Indians were difficult to enslave because they often could easily escape and return to their own people. <br>
<i> Real slavery(the word &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; derives from &ldquo;Slav&rdquo; give the large numbers of them being enslaved locally and for export in the Slavic lands) existed in Europe for a much longer time than in Africa.

Note in this regard that &ldquo;serf&rdquo; derives from the Latin &ldquo;servus&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;slave&rdquo;. </i></p>
<p>Serfdom ended, but indentured servitude and other forms of bondage didn&rsquo;t. About 100,000 of the whites who came to the English colonies were indentured servants. At its best, indentured servitude could be a pretty good deal, but at its worst it was every bit as bad as chattel slavery.</p>
<p>White servants (who called themselves slaves and were called slaves by their masters) were chained together in coffles and marched about the countryside to be sold to farmers. The harsh conditions of white slaves in the colonies were well known, and recruiters often resorted to abduction to get new supplies. &ldquo;Crimps&rdquo; and &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; would slip a Micky Finn in the drinks of unsuspecting tavern patrons who would wake up in chains in the holds of ships bound for the colonies. The holds in which they were kept were often every bit as miserable as any slave ship, and many died in the crossing.  The term &ldquo;kidnapping&rdquo; derives from the term &ldquo;kid nabbing,&rdquo; a charming practice in which the dealers in white slaves paid thugs to go into poor neighborhoods and snatch children off the streets who were then shipped to the New World with forged papers of indenture. Crimps and spirits were so hated and feared that they were sometimes attacked in the street by mobs.<br>
 <br>
Poor families living on charity were often forced to sign children over to recruiters.  Judges gave prisoners the choice of hanging or going into servitude in the colonies; some chose hanging.<br>
 <br>
Physical abuse was rampant. At one point the Virginia colony had to forbid masters from burying dead servants in secret; the masters were hiding the evidence of having beaten servants to death. Servants generally died of mistreatment, exhaustion, hunger and disease before their terms of indenture were up. Female servants were often raped, and adding insult to injury, they had time added to their terms of indenture for becoming pregnant.  The newspapers of the era are full of ads seeking information about runaway servants.</p>
<p>The industrial era was often just as bad. Children worked in coal mines ten hours a day six days a week, and frequently died of black lung and other ailments before reaching their mid-teens. Children in factories were often chained to the machines at which they labored and beaten with steel rods if they misbehaved.</p>
<p>It is amusing to note that a slave on a Southern plantation often had better food, clothing, shelter, health care and more leisure time than a wage slave in a Northern factory or mine. And unlike a wage slave, a chattel slave&rsquo;s master was morally and legally obligated to support the slave even when the slave was injured or too sick or too old to work.</p>
<p><i>Domestic slavery in Africa was more like bonded servantship than anything else. It was qualitatively and quantitatively very different from the capitalism-driven chattel slavery of the Americas, South Africa, Cape Verde, etc. </i></p>
<p> The fact remains that the vast majority of Africans who died in the African slave trade were killed by their fellow Africans long before they ever reached the western coast and saw a white face. Africa is also one of the few places in the world where slavery is still openly practiced &mdash; along with human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism.</p>
<p><i> Although blacks were slaves in the tent households of dissolute and lazy Arabs most of the slaves of the &ldquo;Arabs&rdquo; &mdash; a very broad term that includes any one who happens to speak Arabic or is even Turk or Persian &mdash; most of the slaves of the North African and West Asian Muslims were of European stock &mdash; especially white women in constant demand for harem work. </i><br>
 <br>
Gosh, I guess that means the Arabs and Muslims owe us an awful lot of reparations, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p> Whatever the racial mix of slaves in the Arab-Islamic world may have been over the centuries, it remains true that they took at least as many slaves out of sub-Sahara Africa as the Europeans. The Europeans learned everything they knew about the African slave trade from the Arabs.<br>

		<p>For some reason,every time black slavery is mentioned there is 1 race of people that are always omitted from the discussion. Who owned the slave ships and who made the most profits? The answer is very simple. Jews ran the black slave trade and blamed the White man for it. I have a lecture by Professor Tony Martin entitled The Jewish Role in Black Slavery. If I win the lottery I would buy a copy for all members of Congress to see with their own eyes. I hit 4 numbers twice last week so there is a chance this could happen. I have an idea!! Maybe slave descendants should pay for all the riots and cities they have destroyed in the last 45 years!! Has anyone added up the cost of those crimes?</p>

		<p>All of mankind practiced slavery for tens if not hudnreads of thousands of years.  It is only in the past few hundred years that slavery begun to be abolished.  The vast majority of effort and military action to abolish slavery has been lead by white people.</p>

		<p>The latest &#8216;reparations&rsquo; angle is to give tax free status to those of African slave heritage. It would be hidden into a huge tax tax relief bill that would surprisingly written by Democrats. I heard this from a reliable source. </p>

		<p>I disagree with his assertion that President Obama somehow is in a good position because of his biraciality to deal with the reparations question. A significant number of African-Americans are indeed of mixed racial background anyway, most likely including Gates himself. If anyone is in the best place to deal with the reparations question, that individual would most likely be a recent African immigrant that has come to identify with the African-American experience.</p>
<p>Gates fails to highlight the subsequent colonial period in Africa post-transatlantic slave trade. Although it seems obvious that there were Africans themselves that participated in the slave trade (how could there not be?) slavery did not operate as a societal institution such as it did in the United States and other parts of the Americas, where pervasive racist discourses made a particularly brutal kind of labor exploitation able to gain traction among large segments of the population.</p>
<p>Also, he says that the &ldquo;Asante Empire in Ghana exported slaves and used the profits to import gold.&rdquo; This statement is categorically FALSE. The very region of modern Ghana where the Asante Empire existed is rich in gold resources to this day – I have been to the gold mines. Why would the Asante import what they possess in abundance? Answer: they would not and did not.</p>
<p>While I do not condemn Gates seeking to discuss slavery in a more informed, more nuanced, and more holistic way, his deciding to link the discussion to the issues of reparations (with an implicit undercurrent that certain African states should pay some of those reparations to African-Americans) seems rather counterproductive. What he fails to realize is the exportation of human cargo from the Continent had a negative effect on the societies left behind (and their descendants) as well as on the descendants of those transported. The European colonial powers that participated in the trade suffered few tangible human losses in their engagement in the slave trade. Insofar as modern day Africans are responsible for the actions of their ancestors, so too then are African-Americans all of whose ancestors were both victims and perpetrators of the slave trade.</p>
<p>For Gates to selectively choose which Africans to associate African-Americans with (i.e. those Africans sold into slavery), he fails to consider that some of those sold left suffering families behind and that some of those captured very well may have been part of the slave trade themselves before their seizure.</p>
