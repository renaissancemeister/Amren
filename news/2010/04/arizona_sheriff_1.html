<h1>Arizona Sheriff Says Cops Are Being Killed by Illegal Aliens; Joins Call for U.S. Troops at Border</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, CNS News, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Law enforcement officials from the Arizona counties hardest hit by illegal immigration say they want U.S. troops to help secure the border, to prevent the deaths of more officers at the hands of criminals who enter the country illegally.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;We&rsquo;ve had numerous officers that have been killed by illegal immigrants in Arizona,&#8221; Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said Monday at a Capitol Hill news conference. &#8220;And that shouldn&rsquo;t happen one time.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Babeu said the violence in Arizona has reached &#8220;epidemic proportions&#8221; and must be stopped. &#8220;In just one patrol area, we&rsquo;ve had 64 pursuits  &mdash;  failure to yield for an officer  &mdash;  in one month,&#8221; Babeu said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s out of control.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
The recent murder of Arizona rancher Robert Krentz, who was shot to death last month on his own property, apparently by an illegal alien, also has fueled public outrage.<br>
 <br>
Arizona Sens. John McCain and John Kyl, both Republicans, called Monday&rsquo;s news conference to announce a 10-point plan to secure the border between Arizona and Mexico. They are requesting the immediate deployment of 3,000 National Guard troops and a permanent increase of 3,000 more Custom and Border Protection Agents along the state&rsquo;s border by 2015.</p>
<p>McCain, who faces a tough primary election against conservative Republican JD Hayworth in September, sponsored an immigration-reform bill in 2000 that would have established a guest-worker program and a &#8220;pathway to citizenship&#8221; for illegal immigrants. The bill was opposed by many conservatives. He also supported immigration-reform bills in 2006 and again in 2007.<br>
 <br>
But on Monday, McCain was talking only about enforcement: &#8220;The lesson is clear: First we have to secure the border,&#8221; McCain said.  &#8220;If you want to enact some other reforms, how can that be effective when you have a porous border?&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Later on Monday, McCain told Fox News&rsquo;s Bill O&rsquo;Reilly that he changed his stance on immigration over a year ago. McCain also made that point at Monday&rsquo;s press conference: <br>
 <br>
&#8220;Let me just say that one of the requirements is absolutely that we need to send 3,000 National Guard troops along the Arizona Mexico border  &mdash;  something that Senator Kyl and I called for well over a year ago,&#8221; McCain said. <br>
 <br>
{snip}<br>
 <br>
The senators&rsquo; plan includes a wide range of tactics for securing the border, including funding and supporting Operation Streamline, which calls for criminal charges against and incarceration of individuals who enter the U.S. illegally. <br>
 <br>
{snip}<br>
 <br>
Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever said he believes the porous southern border is not only dangerous to Arizona but to the entire nation, since terrorists could slip through just as easily as drug dealers. &#8220;To me, therein lies the real threat to our homeland security,&#8221; Dever said.<br>
 <br>
The senators announced their 10-point plan on the same day the Arizona Legislature sent a tough new immigration bill to Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who has not yet said whether she will sign it.<br>
 <br>
The bill, championed as a law-and-order measure by its supporters, would make it a misdemeanor to be in the state illegally, and it would require police to question people about their immigration status if there&rsquo;s reason to suspect they&rsquo;re in the country illegally.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/36022.html">John McCain Tacks Right on Immigration </a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Kasie Hunt, Politico, April 19, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Sen. John McCain praised a tough Arizona anti-immigration bill that will let police arrest people who aren&rsquo;t carrying identification, the latest move in McCain&rsquo;s rightward shift in advance of a tough Republican Senate primary this summer. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a very important step forward,&#8221; McCain said Monday. &#8220;I can fully understand why the legislature would want to act.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dramatic switch for a senator who supported comprehensive immigration reform with Democratic lion Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) just four years ago. McCain is facing a primary challenge from the right in former Rep. J.D. Hayworth. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration reform advocates were bewildered. </p>
<p>&#8220;He risked his political career for immigration reform, and now he is compromising his principles to fight for his political life,&#8221; said Frank Sharry, executive director of America&rsquo;s Voice and a longtime immigration reform advocate. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill passed the state&rsquo;s House on a largely party-line vote last week, and is set for a vote in the Arizona Senate Monday.</p>
<p>McCain&rsquo;s comments to reporters came as he and fellow Republican Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl unveiled a 10 step plan to secure Arizona&rsquo;s border with Mexico. McCain and Kyl want to send 3,000 National Guard troops to help an overstretched border patrol curtail increasingly violent incidents along the border, among other measures. </p>
<p>McCain said the plan did not need to move in tandem with a potential federal immigration reform bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lesson is clear: First we have to secure the border,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;If you want to enact some other reforms, how can that be effective when you have a porous border?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;So we have to secure the border first,&#8221; he said.<br>
McCain asked the federal government for more National Guard troops last year, but the request was not granted. The National Guard has been deployed to protect the border before, Kyl said, but troops were moved out as the war in Iraq escalated and their capabilities were needed elsewhere. </p>
<p>Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) are writing a bipartisan immigration bill the administration says it wants to push through Congress this year. Lawmakers have been meeting with business and labor interests to try and hash out an agreement. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McCain was a key author of immigration reform during President George W. Bush&rsquo;s second term, and has previously championed many of the border security measures included in the package he unveiled Monday.<br>

		<p>Wow&hellip;.alot of people certainly got a big laugh at John McCains expense over this.</p>
<p>Seriously though, his career is over and this will probably be what defines it&hellip;.hypocrisy over immigration.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, the very fact that he has made such a ridiculous 180 on his opinion shows that the tea party has some real teeth.  Not just the democrats are fearing them now but the good old boys who caused so much damage when elected as republicans.</p>

<p>Senor Juan McAmnesty, he say this:</p>
<p><br>
<i>But on Monday, McCain was talking only about enforcement: &ldquo;The lesson is clear: First we have to secure the border,&rdquo; McCain said.</i></p>
<p><br>
Only <i>now</i> you figure this out? But Senor Juan, that border has needed securing from the time you went into politics   &mdash;   several decades ago! Not only did you do nothing to secure the border, you actively promoted its erasure! And then, to add insult to injury, you called Americans too lazy for farm work!</p>
<p><i>Lo ciento, Senor Juan</i>, but it is too late for you now. <i>Mucho, mucho</i> too late-o. And no, we&rsquo;re not going to support your bimbo RINO daughter, either. Now <i>váyase, usted traidor mugriento!</i></p>
<p><i>Meanwhile&hellip;</i></p>
<p>A list of clueless overprivileged Republicans and fellow-travelers who need to be GONE by 2012, if the Republican Party is to survive AT ALL:</p>
<p><br>
* Juan McAmnesty<br>
* David Frum<br>
* David Brooks <br>
* Lindsay Graham<br>
* Most of NRO<br>
* Everybody named Bush</p>
<p><br>
Oh, I know there are PLENTY more   &mdash;   so please feel free to add your favorite Country Club Repub to this list! </p>

		<p>I live in Arizona and really hope Haywoth beats the stuffing out of McCain. McCain has done zilch for Arizona,other than wanting to flood the state with Mexicans. Now that he is up for re-election all of a sudden McCain wants the border enforced. McCain is so transparent you can see through him. He has now shown himself so eager to be re-elected he will say or do anything. The man is pathetic. Why doesn&rsquo;t he just let his millionaire wife support him. McCain has so much money his campaign has apparently called every home in Arizona. I know his campaign called my house. Life is about wanting things, and I want McCain so badly defeated he&rsquo;ll never show his face again. </p>

		<p>John McCain is a typical opportunistic politician. He has overseen and enabled the ongoing ethnic cleansing of the white population for over 20 years. But he wants to spend another 7 years being a lapdog for neocons and his &#8220;good friends across the aisle&#8221;. Lets hope the people of AZ will finally elect someone who has their best interests in mind. I hope McCain spends his retirement years pondering the damage he has done to this once great nation. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t believe McCain, he has lied before, like when he said repeatedly that he was against amnesty when he only meant his special definition of it which he knew was not the public&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s called dishonesty. IMO he&rsquo;s not to be trusted. </p>

		<p>white people of america, get yourselves armed, right now. what just happened in downtown kansas city stands as a warning for us all. over the weekend 900 blacks descended on this white shopping area and absolutely destroyed the place. in the course of 2 hours more than 56 rapes were reported, and more than a dozen young white males who fought back now lie comatose, savagely beaten, in local hospitals. the cops actually ran when confronted. its was unbelievable mayhem. apparently this same area was attacked just weeks before. not one single report on the media. not one. a search of the web now confirms similar incidents have happened in more than a dozen cities and the attacks are being orchestarted by community activists employed by ACORN and SEIU. kc ploce chief held meeting today with perpetraors and actually promised to pay the gang leaders if they stayed out of white areas. this same type attack happened in philadelphia just a few weeks ago. the only thing the cops did was to arrest one young white kid who used a pistol to ward off nine black teenagers attempting to rape an 89 year old grandmother in the parking lot after they knocked her down, kicked her dentures out and put out one of her eyes. she is recovering from her injuries in a kc hospital. the kid was arrested and is being charged with a hate crime. again, not one single report on the msm.  </p>

		<p>The National Guard should not be guarding the border, that&rsquo;s a job for the regulars.  NG live locally, and if you want a soldier to do his duty unflinchingly, don&rsquo;t ask him and his family to live among all the Mexicans who have flooded the Southwest.  Additionally, using regular infantry, with artillery and air support, makes a clear statement to Mexico that we are no longer a cesspit for their unwanted population.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;McCain, who faces a tough primary election against conservative Republican JD Hayworth in September, sponsored an immigration-reform bill in 2000 that would have established a guest-worker program and a &lsquo;pathway to citizenship&rsquo; for illegal immigrants.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Hopefully, Johnny (Comrade Weasel) McCain, will really get what is coming to him in this primary, his empty head handed to him by the Arizona Republican voters. He is an arrogant and worthless multicultural prima donna, who is so feckless and wretched that he holds the distinction of joyfully losing the US Presidency to a mulatto. If JD Hayworth is smart, he will have some gung-ho volunteers start showing up at McCain fundraisers and speeches and toss lettuce at him, or come dressed up as lettuce heads, blaring recordings of this gem:</p>

<p>That would be hilariously jolly and then some!</p>

		<p>I sincerely hope that the Arizona Governor signs the bill that would finally start to protect Americans. So far, we&rsquo;ve been at the mercy of the criminals who invade our nation. If it&rsquo;s signed, we&rsquo;ll know someone cares about us. If not, the governor might as well say, &#8220;We prefer illegals to law-abiding, taxpaying, voting Americans. McCain is laughable. He has worked hard to keep our borders open. Now, that he can&rsquo;t deny the crimes committed by illegals, he&rsquo;s suddenly done a 180. I saw him on C-Span in the middle of the night and he was spouting his &#8220;new&#8221; tactics and trying to look convincing, but he didn&rsquo;t make the sale.</p>

		<p>Anybody from the KC or Philadelphia areas know anything about post #22 by wb?  I don&rsquo;t expect the national msm to carry these stories, but they do get mentioned in the local press, if only once.  56 rapes and a more than a dozen men lying comatose is worth 30 seconds on the local TV news, even if they are White.  </p>

		<p>God I hope McCain is beat. He more than anyone I can think of is a traitor.  Being from Arizona he has known all along what a disaster illegal immigration is for the American worker.  But no, he has to make sure all that cheap labor comes across the border for his buddies to exploit while the rest of us pick up the bill. There was not an iota of difference between him and Obama on this issue in the last Presidential election  He needs to be punished as a lesson to the rest of these political hacks who are selling us out</p>

		<p>The posting by wb is greatly exagerated.  I live near Kansas City and own property in Kansas City.  The Plaza was swarmed by a large group of black who were there to cause trouble but no major property damage was done and I heard of no sexual assaults.  Everyone is talking around the race issue at least on the record but anyone who is a realist knows the score.  The Plaza was mostly back to its old self the next weekend (at least by Plaza Merchants Assn. approved newscasts) but with a greatly increased police presence.  I&rsquo;m sure lots of previously race dilusional people changed their thinking in response to the events on the Plaza in the last month.  The Plaza is within a 15 minute walk of one of the worst ghettoes this side of the Mississippi and the violence there is largely hushed in the news.  </p>

		<p>I sincerely hope McCain is mauled in the election.  He needs to go.  He could come out tomorrow as a champion of white self-determination and freedom of association and I&rsquo;d still want him gone.  Enough&rsquo;s enough, the man&rsquo;s proven himself a menace more times than I can count.</p>

		<p>NOW the cops and the pols are getting it?</p>
<p>ONLY after cops are killed and engage in a lot of high speed pursuits?</p>
<p>How many American citizens PER DAY are killed by illegals? About a half dozen to a dozen every day, and this has been occurring for decades now. Internal deaths in the U.S. per year at the hands of illegals makes the war casualties in Iraq seems trivial?</p>
<p>And NOW, the cops are up in arms??</p>

<p>The numbers below reflect a more accurate count of the carnage caused by Mexican illegals: </p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve Americans are murdered every day by illegal aliens, according to statistics released by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. That translates to 4,380 Americans murdered annually by illegal aliens. <br>
  <br>
While King reports 12 Americans are murdered daily by illegal aliens, he says 13 are killed by drunk illegal alien drivers ­ for another annual death toll of 4,745.&#8221;</p>

<p>You forgot to include the thousands of American men, women and children killed annualy by drunken, unlicensed, uninsured Mexican illegals.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how many Americans are crippled, maimed and burned every year by these invaders, but the number has to exceed that of those killed.  </p>
