<h1>Official Statement from Kyle Bristow Regarding &#8220;Hate Group&#8221; Claims</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kyle Bristow, April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On April 23, 2010, the popular Above the Law blog published an article which alleges that students at my law school  &mdash;  the University of Toledo College of Law  &mdash;  are concerned about my political beliefs and past conservative activism. The author of the article greatly mischaracterizes me, exaggerates selective aspects of my prior political activity, uses unsavory hyperbole to malign me, utilizes &#8220;guilt-by-association&#8221; tactics to make tasteless ad hominem attacks against me, and quotes purported students at my law school  &mdash;  who hide behind a cowardly anonymity  &mdash;  who attack me for my conservative beliefs. The word &#8220;hate&#8221; is mentioned no less than four times in the brief article  &mdash;  five if you include the title  &mdash;  and nothing about it is fair and balanced. In effect, the article is an anti-conservative diatribe.</p>
<p>The petty attacks that are being maliciously and relentlessly made against me are motivated by differences in political opinion between left-wing agitators and me. Arguably, these unwarranted attacks are being perpetrated against me because of my steadfast opposition to affirmative action programs, illegal immigration, socialism, and multiculturalism. While Right-thinking individuals appreciate my beliefs and past political advocacy, the Left finds them to be disagreeable.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few years, I have received much praise from fellow conservative activists and politicians. Saul Anuzis, the former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, said of me that I am &#8220;exactly the type of young kid we want out there&#8221;; a member of the U.S. Congress once told a group of people at a countywide Republican meeting that I am the &#8220;face of the Republican Party&#8221;; and Jennifer Gratz, who acted as the executive director for the Michigan ballot initiative to outlaw affirmative action, thanked in her victory speech the university-sanctioned student organization I led at Michigan State University for being invaluable in the campaign. I have received awards and scholarships for my conservative activism, I have been elected to public office, I have appeared on The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor, I have been quoted by Sean Hannity on his television show, I was invited to a private function with President Bush, I have been invited to private dinners with presidential candidates, politicians  &mdash;  including those running for governor and U.S. Senate  &mdash;  have sought my endorsement, and I have been contacted by conservative activists across our nation who wish to emulate me at their universities.</p>
<p>As the chairman of the Michigan State University chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom, I participated in public debates and forums on issues including embryonic stem cell research, illegal immigration, and affirmative action (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWmFc6_UT0A). I also hosted numerous prominent conservative speakers who discussed a number of issues. Speakers I hosted include Chris Simcox of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps, Congressman Tom Tancredo, Nick Griffin of the British National Party (who is the chairman of the fourth-largest and fastest growing political party in the U.K., who has been elected to the European Parliament, and who will likely be elected to the U.K. Parliament this year), Islamic-terrorist-turned-Christian Walid Shoebat, Jennifer Gratz of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, urban conservative Akindele Akinyemi, Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, documentary filmmakers Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinney, and author Ryan Sorba, among many, many others. I contributed very much to intellectual political discourse at Michigan State University, because these events were always open to the public, free to attend, and time was set aside for audience members to ask questions of the speakers.</p>
<p>For standing up for conservatism, I have needed police protection on at least six occasions, I have been physically kicked to the ground, I have been spat on and cursed, and some of the speaking engagements I hosted were horribly disrupted by left-wing agitators (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXDLVI4wz6k). In fact, the campus police even requested that Chris Simcox wear a bullet-proof vest at his event for his own safety. The infantile words the Left is now using to cowardly and pathetically attack me are nothing compared to the hostility I have faced over the years for standing up for my conservative ideals.</p>
<p>Amazingly, one leftist recently advised me to apologize for my conservative beliefs and told me that I should send out a press release through which I would grovel for their forgiveness. I am proud of my conservative activism through which I defended freedom, the Constitution, Western culture, and morality, and I will not apologize for any of it  &mdash;  I have done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Instead of participating in civilized political discourse, the Left has made it their mission to tortiously malign my character. Even though I have never been convicted of a crime and have never been deemed to have violated the Student Honor Code at either my undergraduate university or at my law school, various individuals are publicly alleging  &mdash;  both implicitly and explicitly  &mdash;  that I have engaged in criminal activity by committing hate crimes, that I am likely to be the cause of a Virginia Tech-style massacre, that I am unfit to practice law, that I am unfit to work at a reputable law firm, that I am mentally unstable, and that I am a homosexual. These leftist agitators are also using inappropriate slurs  &mdash;  including &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; and &#8220;Hitler wannabe&#8221;  &mdash;  to describe me. One individual affiliated with law students has even publicly encouraged people to &#8220;beat the shit&#8221; out of me, while others have joked  &mdash;  presumably  &mdash;  about physically harming me.</p>
<p>Lawyers with whom I have consulted have advised me to sue anyone who maliciously makes defamatory statements about me which overtly allege that I have committed a crime or claim that I am mentally or ethically unfit to be a lawyer. Being that IP traces can easily be done with a subpoena, cowards who anonymously libel me in the comment sections of online articles will be tracked down and sued, as will those who tortiously libel me on Facebook, Twitter, and blogs.</p>
<p>I am being viciously persecuted for my political thoughts by law students who wish to punish me for having exercised my constitutional and God-given right to free speech through which I directly confronted the politically-correct left-wing dogma that unfortunately permeates academia. One would only think and hope that future American lawyers  &mdash;  who must swear to uphold the Constitution when they are granted their law licenses  &mdash;  would respect free speech rather than act in ways that are congruent with Sharia law and what many political scientists refer to as &#8220;soft totalitarianism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite what the radical Left thinks, one who defends the Constitution and freedom and who is proud of his culture and heritage is not barred from practicing law. There was once a day in our nation&rsquo;s history when devotion to the Constitution and freedom was required to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>Defiantly and Unapologetically in Freedom,</p>
<p>Kyle J. Bristow</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll give him this, he knows better than to show a scintilla of apology.  If liberals want apologies, they should apologize to one another; if liberal whites want to apologize to non-whites, they can have at it.  But they should leave me, and whites in general, out of it.  They speak only for themselves.</p>

<p>Good show Kyle, I have long stated that this is the course to take. Make these smear merchants prove their statements in a court of law, they are obviously trying to damage you professionally. Suing is a favorite tactic of groups like the SPLC and they are the worst defamers around. Time to make them feel the heat of a lawsuit.</p>

		<p>Dear Kyle Bristow,</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve become a lighting rod, use it to expand the consciousnesses of latent conservatives.    The Arizona law is criticized for &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;.    Isn&rsquo;t the minority race privilege of Affirmative Action also racial profiling?   It profiles White Citizens for being rejected from job opportunities, and it profiles blacks for privilege, profit, and power. </p>
<p>I am White, therefore it is a required mandate that employers not employee me because of my White Euopean skin color until they have first privileged those with black african skin color.</p>
<p>How much longer can such an injustice remain?</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>The White Apollo<br>

		<p>You, Kyle Bristow, ARE America and I salute you. You&rsquo;ve got more people on your side than you&rsquo;ll ever know. Too bad most of them are in hiding and will never have the &#8220;rocks&#8221; to openly support you. Stick to your guns and NEVER apologize or grovel to them or they WILL destroy you. How many times have you ever seen Al $harpton or Je$$ie Jack$on apologize or grovel and look where they&rsquo;re at. As long as you&rsquo;ve got God, the truth, and facts on your side, you can&rsquo;t lose.</p>

		<p>I applaud what I know of Bristow&rsquo;s issue stances and past activism, and I&rsquo;m all for vigorous, spirited, and unapologetic defense of the West and oneself.   I certainly am glad he is not groveling.</p>
<p>However my advice is to him is to avoid the temptation to hit back just as hard or harder.  Avoid directly negatively characterizing your enemies, their motives, or actions, REGARDLESS of how true such characterizations are, or how urgently necessary it may be to get that out.</p>
<p>Let them be the ones to engage in over-the-top, purple prose.  Let them be the ones to lard their writing with harsh adverbs and adjectives.  Let them discredit themselves with their aggressiveness.  Showing is better than telling; just show us how vicious and unfair their are without telling us about it; use them as your source rather than yourself.</p>
<p>In just this one essay, among the names you&rsquo;ve called your critics and others: tasteless, petty, malicious, agitators, vicious, radicals, cowards, and so on.  Unwilling to let their actions speak for and discredit themselves, you&rsquo;ve used weak and/or unneeded adverbs like horribly, greatly, pathetically, and more.</p>
<p>You should also not praise yourself with words like steadfast, or tell the story yourself about how others seek to emulate you.</p>
<p>In the cold, black-and-white medium of text, such things make you seem as if you are flailing and lashing out in all directions, and far more excitable, more radical, and less credible than I am sure you really are, and in so doing do far more harm than help for yourself and your cause.</p>
<p>Josh Billings once said, &ldquo;One of the greatest victories you can gain over someone is to beat him at politeness.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Trying to out-shout the Left never works.  Rather, being calmer and milder than an angry attacker automatically puts you in control, makes you seem more rational and credible, makes him seem like the extremist and lunatic.   By all means, quote the most extreme statements and allegations against you, without characterizing them with anything more than the most mild of terms (untrue, baseless, perhaps even false, and only one at a time), then respond with an understated reaction, such as mild bemusement, such as a George F. Will-esque &#8220;Well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Learn from the late Sen. Jesse Helms, who was the soul of courtesy, and from Jared Taylor, who is always well-mannered and in control. </p>

		<p>This is what we need more of in our country today!!!  Thank you, Mr. Bristol, for being willing to stand your ground.  I believe the more people like you start coming to the fore, the less the insane leftists will be able to attack you with any effectiveness.  I hope your excellent example inspires more conservative writers, attorneys, authors, etc. etc. to come out, stand up, and be counted.  I applaud you.</p>

		<p>Mr. Bristow has shown remarkable courage in the face of a growing totalitarianism that stands opposed to individual freedoms. We are in a fight for our vary way of life more dangerous than any religious fundamentalist. The left has taken refuge in our Universities and have turned them into temples of hate, dictatorship, intolerance and anti-intellectual pools. A professor of mine 20 years ago spoke of the ongoing &#8216;dumbing down&rsquo; of our society in general and Universities in particular and believed as a result, we were seeing the end of a great civilization. I cannot help but agree.</p>

		<p>By all means, you should sue them. Their attacks will never cease until you employ every method possible to defend your person and honor, and to expose those that file anonymous, scurrilous attacks. By exposing them you can then extract money from them, and you should take every dime you can squeeze.</p>

		<p>Aside from everything else that&rsquo;s wrong with this situation, it&rsquo;s a victory for political correctness and the rampant racial lunacy in general that Mr. Bristow must take a defensive position when his views are so close to the good old mainstream. </p>
<p>If things were right, those who push affirmative action, illegal immigration, socialism, and multiculturalism would be on the fringes and assuming a defensive posture. </p>
