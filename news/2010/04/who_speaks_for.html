			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>American Renaissance, November 1990</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>        <p> <span class="dropcap">I</span>n the fall of [1990], we wrote a modest, one-sentence advertisement for <b><i>American Renaissance,</i></b> which we called a &ldquo;literate, undeceived journal of race, immigration, and the decline of civility.&rdquo; A well-known conservative publication called the ad &ldquo;controversial,&rdquo; and refused to accept it. In so doing, that publication once more confirmed how thoroughly silenced are the voices that will speak through American Renaissance. </p><p> Merely to put the words &ldquo;race, immigration, and the decline of civility&rdquo; in the same sentence is to step across the line that separates what may be said publicly from what may not. Despite the American tradition of free speech and the fervor with which we claim to defend it, nearly every American takes the greatest care not to cross that line. There are subjects on which debate has ended, the book has been closed, and this is to be so no matter how much the reality of our daily lives clashes with conclusions that have been declared as final. </p><p> Today it is foreigners who have not learned the limits of what may be said in America who are most likely to step across that strongly defended line. In 1986, then-Prime Minister Nakasone of Japan provoked a torrent of outrage when he said that because large numbers of blacks and Hispanics live in the United States, it cannot compete as effectively with other nations as it might otherwise. </p><p> In fact, blacks and Hispanics are, compared to whites, far more likely to be poor, illiterate, on welfare, or in jail; they are far more likely to have illegitimate children, be addicted to drugs, or have AIDS. By no definition of international competitiveness can the presence of these populations be anything but a disadvantage. How many Americans must have thought to themselves, &ldquo;Mr. Nakasone is right&rdquo;  &mdash;  and said nothing? Americans of European heritage, the cultural heirs of the people who founded and built this nation, were silent. </p><br>
        <table class="boxcenter"><tr><td><img src="/ar/1990/11/culture2.GIF" height="243" width="400" alt=""> </td></tr></table><p> The United States is unquestionably less competitive because so many blacks and Hispanics are in jail or on welfare, but none dares say so. America is an increasingly dangerous and disagreeable place because of growing numbers of blacks and Hispanics (see following story), but none dares say this either. It is our actions that speak for us rather than our words. When we choose our neighborhoods or our schools, when we mentally demarcate entire sections of our cities as places to be avoided, we are saying something important about race, but we say it silently. White people have all but lost their public voice. </p><p> Today in America, there are hundreds of organizations that speak for blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians, but virtually no one speaks for us. While other racial and ethnic groups work tirelessly to advance their group interests  &mdash;  often at our expense  &mdash;  we alone are not to think of ourselves as a people with our own ideals and aspirations. </p> <p> Some of us have become afraid to say openly what we know to be true. Others  &mdash;  sincere, thoughtful, concerned Americans  &mdash;  have been convinced that it is improper, even immoral, for white people to think of themselves as a group or to speak out as white people. We believe that in the pages of <b><i>American Renaissance</i></b> these people will find reasons to think that it is not only moral but necessary. </p><p> For though we are still three-fourths of the population, this society speaks and acts as if it were devoted to the interests of everyone but us. In the name of &ldquo;equal opportunity,&rdquo; America practices systematic, legal discrimination against whites. In the name of &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; it sponsors massive non-white immigration. In the name of &ldquo;multi-culturalism,&rdquo; its schools belittle the heritage that gave our nation its name, identity, laws, and moral foundation. In the name of &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; it encourages groups who seek our dispossession. </p><p> Is dispossession too strong a word? Fifty years ago this nation was more than 90 percent white. In another fifty years, we are cheerfully told, it will be less than half white. Fifty years ago, the United States had an unmistakable national and cultural core. In another half century, if whites continue to cooperate in their own dispossession, this nation will have no core and no identity. </p><p> We at <b><i>American Renaissance</i></b> believe that for a nation to be a nation  &mdash;  and not just a crowd  &mdash;  it must consist of people that share the same culture, language, history and aspirations. It is in this sense that Norway, France and Japan are nations, and that the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia are not. If we continue to permit the erosion of the essential conditions of nationhood and, indeed, of any healthy sense of neighborhood or community, the frictions that torment us today will be as nothing compared to the chaos that will come. The squalor of Detroit, the violence of Washington (DC), and the savagery of New York City must not mark the way to the future. </p><p> If the American people loses coherence, our culture will weaken and our history will fade. We cannot expect Mexican immigrants, Vietnamese refugees, or militant blacks to care if Shakespeare disappears from our schools or if the Jefferson Memorial falls into decay. We cannot expect people who have nothing in common with each other but the legal abstraction of citizenship to work or sacrifice for the the common good. A nation can be nothing more than its people, and if its people changes, so must its character. </p><p> We at <b><i>American Renaissance</i></b> love our nation and cherish its heritage. We will not be silent accomplices to dispossession. Ours is the culture of Galileo, Newton, Beethoven, Jefferson, and Edison. We are heirs to the spirit of Valley Forge, and the Alamo. It is our duty and privilege to carry forward as best we can the greatness of this legacy. </p><p> <b><i>American Renaissance</i></b> will speak for our people. It will speak with the confidence that is born of a conviction of what is right. For we bear malice towards none, and have no wish to trample the rights of others. We wish happiness and cultural integrity for all peoples, just as we pursue them for ourselves. </p><p> More than two centuries ago, the men who built this nation pledged to their cause their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor. Today, the crisis may not seem so sharp, nor the path of honor so clear, but what is at stake is no less important: the future of a nation.</p>

		<p>This was a profound and powerful statement when it was published twenty years ago.  That it is at least as true and relevant today as it was two decades ago is not cause for celebration. It is cause for a heightened sense of alarm and awareness that if the tide is not turned we will find outselves fully dispossessed of our nation, our culture, our values, and, ultimately, many of our lives.</p>
<p>This will mark the first time in recorded human history that a majority population will have ceded control to a less intelligent, largely non-productive, criminally inclined, and hopelessly non-inventive minority.  This bizarre state of affairs has no precedent.  A people barely out of the Stone Age will have harnessed (literally) a far better, in every respect, population for their own purposes.</p>
<p>In reality the likelihood of this happening is remote.  But the survival of this nation in its present form is at least equally remote.</p>

		<p>Where it all started! I have to say this is a very good introduction to AmRen, keeping just the right tone. To draw a comparison, Richard Hoste&rsquo;s recent introduction to AlternativeRight.com was good but at the same time a little too abrasive I thought. You have to be careful when setting out your stall so as give people the right &#8216;first impressions&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m actually closely involved in setting up a fladgeling political movement right now and we&rsquo;re working on a manifesto; this is an example worth sharing with my friends as a template. (One of our members has attended a few AR conferences incidentally.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been nearly twenty years and AR&rsquo;s still going strong: keep up the good work!</p>

<p>Now, just under 20 years old, this mission statement for AR and what it would fight is more critically germane than could have been anticipated in 1990. We now have a mulatto &ldquo;messiah&rdquo; and are only at best 65% white; multicultural &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; teeters on realization, but with a hard reality sinking in as well. This hard reality being, that it will not work and is making nuclear the mere gasoline and matches fires of the 1960s &ldquo;countercultural&rdquo; nonsense, that has irrevocably divided this country for over four decades. </p>
<p>AR remains the most tenaciously thoughtful sociopolitical publication on this topic, despite what the  SPLC decrees. In fact, that AR and NCF remain on their &ldquo;anti-hate&rdquo; radar as a growing threat, is indicative of this fact. </p>
<p>God bless you Mr. Taylor and the rest of the AR staff and volunteers,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

<p>The funny thing is, despite a college education, I had never even heard of the word &#8220;dispossession&#8221; until I discovered American Renaissance. It was not a part of my vocabulary. When I first heard it, I thought it was some crazy, made-up word used by extremists. (I did manage to find it in the dictionary.)</p>
<p>The reason i was not familiar with the word is that the media <i>never</i> uses it! It is certainly a perfectly legitimate word and it describes a very real phenomenon, but it is completely unheard of by most people.  </p>
<p>While the term &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; is a favorite expression by the MSM and is used to describe anyone who talks about having legitimate white interests, the term dispossession has been banished to the language graveyard. I wonder why?</p>

		<p>The article mentions a notorious 1986 incident in which the prime minister of Japan was villified for telling the truth about racial differences in intelligence.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an article in Time magazine in which they bash the leader of Japan while admitting that statistics back up his comments 100%!<br>

  &mdash;   Tim in Ind<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Perhaps because of a magnificent book, &#8220;The Dispossed Majority&#8221;, written by Wilmot Robertson in 1972. It is a true classic, purposely ignored and relegated to the dustheap; but I cannot recommend it too highly. It was a revelation to me and changed my entire outlook.  It explained and cast fresh light on the facts that I saw going on around me, back then, which I had difficulty reconciling with everything that I had been taught. Suddenly, it all made sense.  </p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s been banished to the language graveyard!</p>

		<p> Dispossession? Question is how many whites have to be killed before the name is changed to genocide? 3ooo in the last ten years in South Africa. Does anybody have a number for how many U.S.Americans? Its been said the pen is mightier than the sword. (I guess using the pen would wake up people to danger)but the main stream media doesn,t report it. Looks like the sword is getting better results today.</p>

		<p>    Beautifully written . So true and soon to be so tragic . At least if you happen to share the same DNA as the Founders . The speed of our own demise has ratcheted up infinitely faster than most of us could have imagined in 1990 . I feel as if I am waiting for America&rsquo;s own personal apocalypse to occur at any moment, it&rsquo;s coming and there is nothing we can do about it .    </p>

<p>I actually almost teared-up at the end while shivers were going up my spine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 22 know, but I was 18 when I stumbled upon this website. It took some years, but AmRen won me over completely some time ago. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t promise victory, but with every fiber of my being I know our movement is just and right and that I will help carry this momentum forward until we win back our nation, or my death, or our destruction.</p>
<p>For ourselves and (most importantly) our posterity, I pledge my life, my fortune, and my sacred honor.</p>

		<p>Considering that explicitly pro-white sentiments are socially unacceptable in polite society, one ought to consider other avenues that promote many of the same ideas without being explicitly racial. In particular I am thinking of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (www.isi.org), which promotes the study of western heritage in college, especially how the Greeks were the foundation of Western Civilization, and how important it is to promote instilling that knowledge of our heritage in our young people who are attending college.</p>

		<p>There are millions of us out there that feel exactly the same way. We are the ones who you see clogging  the freeways going to work, or going home to our quiet, mostly crime free, and mostly white neighborhoods.  There are a few blacks, a few Hispanics, but its no big deal to us, because they follow the same rules we do.  No one wants to talk about them.<br>
We go where we feel safe. </p>
