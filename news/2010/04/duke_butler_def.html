<h1><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/news?slug=jn-race040410">Duke, Butler Defy Racial Stereotypes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason King, Yahoo! Sports, April 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He&rsquo;s been cursed by fans from North Carolina and taunted in road arenas throughout the ACC. Still, the chant that Duke guard Jon Scheyer remembers the most occurred during an AAU game back in high school.</p>
<p>Time and time again as Scheyer dribbled up the court, the opposing coach stood on the sideline and barked orders to his players.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the white boy!&#8221; the coach said. &#8220;Get the white boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Scheyer was the only non-African-American on his team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously,&#8221; Scheyer said, &#8220;he was talking about me. I had a number and a name [on my jersey]. But instead it was &#8216;Get the white boy!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>No one, though, was ever able to stop Scheyer from reaching his potential.</p>
<p>Not at his Chicago-area high school, where he led his team to a state championship. Not at Duke, where he earned first-team all-ACC honors. And not in Indianapolis, where Monday&rsquo;s NCAA title game between the Blue Devils and Butler has taken on an unfamiliar look.</p>
<p>Five white players could be on the court at tipoff. That&rsquo;s the most since 1998, when six white players started in the Utah-Kentucky final.</p>
<p>Gordon Hayward and Matt Howard  &mdash;  two of Butler&rsquo;s top players  &mdash;  are white. So are five of Duke&rsquo;s top seven players.</p>
<p>Even though the race issue isn&rsquo;t discussed in polite company, it&rsquo;s been the subject of hushed conversations at the Final Four and will be obvious to anyone in attendance or tuning in at home. The subject is so taboo that even Larry Bird bristles when it&rsquo;s brought up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Negative stereotypes about lack of speed, agility and leaping ability are being challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it was always just about being a basketball player,&#8221; Hayward said. &#8220;I&rsquo;d watch some of the great white players in the NBA and say, &#8216;Why can&rsquo;t I do that?&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like many people, Bird [Larry Bird, the NBA Hall of Famer and Boston Celtics legend, who is now the president of basketball operations for the Indiana Pacers] doesn&rsquo;t like to talk about the race factor in college basketball and the professional ranks. Last summer he was heavily criticized for selecting Tyler Hansbrough, who is white, with the 13th overall pick in the NBA draft.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When he was in elementary school, Budinger [Chase Budinger, a second-round draft pick from Arizona who is also white] said his friends laughed at him when he told them his goal was to become a professional basketball player.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For a time, Budinger was projected as a first-round pick in last summer&rsquo;s draft, but he slipped into the second round. He thinks he knows why.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard a lot leading up to the draft that I was soft and that I wasn&rsquo;t athletic or quick enough to play in this league,&#8221; Budinger said. &#8220;That stereotype came from being white and from being kind of different.</p>

		<p> Great article! So good to see that at least a few reporters and columnists today aren&rsquo;t afraid to tackle the &#8220;White players in sports&#8221; issue head-on, without indulging in any of the stereotypes about &#8220;slow, not agile, can&rsquo;t jump&#8221; or the cry-baby stuff often written about how &#8220;referees protect White stars but not black.&#8221; As a matter of fact, Jason King points out how the stereotypes are used by other coaches, reporters and fans   &mdash;   often mindlessly.</p>
<p> Last night&rsquo;s game was one of the finest NCAA championships I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and as a Hoosier I&rsquo;d have loved to see Butler win. But they didn&rsquo;t. Duke is simply awesome. But look for some whining from certain sports columnists in the next few days about a couple of calls in the first half that nullified two baskets made by Butler. Expect to hear those commentators note that Butler had &#8220;more black players than Duke&#8221; and that for that reason Duke got the benefit of &#8220;key calls&#8221; from &#8220;biased&#8221; referees. Wait for it&hellip; wait for it &hellip; </p>

		<p>We are now (White people) experiencing the beginnings of real racial hate.  I know what you&rsquo;re thinking;  You&rsquo;re thinking that we&rsquo;ve been experiencing it.  What we&rsquo;ve endured in the last 40 years is minuscule compared to what we will go though in the future if we don&rsquo;t start facing reality.  </p>

		<p>I noticed last night when the refs threw the ball up at tipoff, that five out of the ten men on the court were white.  That&rsquo;s a very high percentage of whites among two given teams, considering today&rsquo;s college game.</p>
<p>Notice the racial harassment against Scheyer.  Did the other AAU teams&rsquo; players and coaches get sensitivity training?  Did that goofy Diversity in Sport Institute at Florida State University issue any condemnations?  Methinks not.</p>

		<p> Take a lesson from Duke, college coaches.Give White players a chance and you will win.Promote student athletes the ones that graduate .Stop wasting your time on thugs.I was at a coaching clinic where Kevin Mackey was speaking.A majority of the coaches were white suburban basketball coaches.Mackey&rsquo;s theme was that you had to go to the inner cities to get black stallions .He kept belaboring the point to the point of nasea.I just wanted someone to say shut up.There was a small white kid sitting in the stands watching the clinic.He was wearing shirt that stated he was Ohio high school scoring champ.Mackey saw him and starting taunting him.Do you want to go against my stallions?<br/>
Mackey&rsquo;s big thing that year was his full court press.So this small white kid went on the court and they inbounded the ball to him and he dribble through the full court press and dunked the ball at the other end of the court.All the coaches in the stands leaped to their feet and started cheering the feat.I realized at that moment that we all felt the same way about Mackey and his black stallion speech.Mackey&rsquo;s assistant coach almost broke his neck running down the court to see who this kid was.It was my greatest moment of any basketball clinic I ever went to. <br/>

		<p>It was not race quotas or affirmative action which placed those white players at the top of a sport once dominated by blacks.  It was not forced &#8216;equality&rsquo;. It was not out of sympathy or charity to perceived white &#8216;underdogs&rsquo;. It was not a move to &#8216;right wrongs&rsquo;, as is often done in other endeavors.</p>
<p>The white players earned their place by demonstrating the right mix of sportsmanship, leadership, talent and physical ability. </p>
<p>Making the cut in the unforgiving sports realm is as close to primal law of the jungle as it gets, and they triumphed.</p>

		<p>In Ohio, an all white team, Jackson HS won the big school division state championship. Their players all seemed to be able to jump, run, shoot and play great defense. Unfortunately, the vast majority of sports announcers support these very racist stereotypes. The white players at Jackson HS, Duke and Butler seemed to smash those stereotypes quite well. Northern Iowa, Cornell and St. Mary&rsquo;s were other teams with mostly white players who had terrific seasons and defeated many, many, predominantly black teams with regularity.</p>

		<p>Correlations?<br/>
The game drew a 14.2 rating which is 31% over last years North Carolina - Michigan State match-up.<br/>
This game had the highest viewership in the last 5 years.<br/>
On raw numbers 48.1 viewers watched at least part of the game - the highest since 1997.</p>
<p>Could you imagine the gut wrenching pain many would have had to endure for eternity had Gordon &#8216;white boy&rsquo; Hayward banked in the winner as time expired? </p>

		<p>Hilarious but sadly pathetic, the article fails to mention that only 15 of the 4,000 eligible men and women basketball players are also academic all americans, just so happens that 2 of those 15 were in the game last night and both were the 2 white boys that started for Butler, It was actually Howards second time as an academic all american. I saw Bird destroy and embarass hundereds of black NBA defenders, the reason he was better was simple, he was smarter and he worked harder, in short a microcosmic sample of overall society.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Get the white boy! Get the white boy!&#8221;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -  How charming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s long been postulated that blacks excel at boxing  &mdash;  or used to anyway  &mdash;  and other contact sports because that&rsquo;s the only legitimate way to take out their rage at whitey. Why they should be so enraged at whitey, at least during my lifetime, is not explained.</p>
<p>Maybe some form of that phenomenon is what drives the white Duke players now. At any rate, I hope they go all the way. And when they do, I hope every fan in the bleachers moons the cameras and chants, &#8220;Mangum, Nifong, Jesse &amp; Al: This is for YOU!!!&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t follow the game but I had noticed the hype during march madness. I may be wrong but this win doesn&rsquo;t seem to have inspired the same level of hype as the build up.</p>

		<p>A couple of quick observations:</p>
<p>In solidarity with the NAACP, the NCAA still bars South Carolina from hosting playoff games because the Confederate flag still hasn&rsquo;t been removed from the S.C. statehouse grounds.</p>
<p>Right after quoting some high school coach as saying &#8220;&#8216;Get the white boy!&rsquo;&#8221; this supposedly white-friendly sports writer points out that &#8220;&#8216;Scheyer was the only non-African-American on his team.&rsquo;&#8221;  Excuse me, did he mean the only non-black player?</p>
<p>The &#8220;liberal&#8221; government, academia, and media, are winning the war of words when we&rsquo;ve become so accustomed to the categorization of blacks as &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; that we cease to challenge them for failing to show us the same courtesy.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t that high school coach have been shouting &#8220;Get the European-American boy! Get the European-American boy!&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, sports fans&hellip;?</p>

		<p>Gee, and all along we&rsquo;ve been led to believe that racism is a trait held exclusively by whites!!  Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that this story gives that one the lie?  The truth is, some of the most vicious racists on the face of the earth are black, and if we don&rsquo;t start telling the truth about that, some real serious situations are going to result.  I mean, I thought that &#8220;Honesty is the best policy&#8221;?!</p>

		<p>I watched this game last night and it was wonderful to witness a national basketball championship featuring non-thuggish, non-tattooed, non-trash talking White kids playing in a quiet, civilized manner, as  Dr. James Naismith of the YMCA intended.</p>
<p>From Wiki:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a 10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I have deep roots in Hoosier territory and I am still furious at Duke for the hateful, racist way the young lacrosse boys were treated, but none of that seemed to matter last night  &mdash;  we were finally able to enjoy basketball without having to watch black thugs, &#8216;people who don&rsquo;t look like us&rsquo;, run up and down the court. </p>
<p>I rooted for BOTH sides, for the White boys on both teams.</p>
<p>Let there be more.</p>

		<p>Re: the commenter who brought up &#8216;Movies of the Week&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t hold my breath that there will ever be a movie about how white underdogs took back a game they invented from blacks.</p>
<p>Almost every time a movie is made about sports it carries a cliche lesson involving blacks rising above racism, to be applied to societal consciousness.  The sports movie has become a predictable Hollywood vehicle of indoctrination.</p>

		<p>Pretend this is the movie 300. Whites are the Spartans, while non-whites (mostly blacks) are the Persians.  If those white Spartans had the balls and determination to stop the other Empire from enslaving their women, children, and elderly and then killing them off, what&rsquo;s the excuse of us white men?  White men, even if most admitted that blacks hate whites, would say, &#8220;Oh, but I understand their rage&#8221; or &#8220;Well, that&rsquo;s only a few blacks&#8221; or a host of other anti-white, self-hating excuses.</p>

		<p>An athletic career in most cases is relatively short.  However many black phenomena comprise most college and pro basketball teams, it&rsquo;s worth noting that practically all of them are personally bankrupt very shortly after their careers end, often dissipating fortunes of several hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Now that takes real talent.</p>

		<p>I believe that white persons mature later than blacks.  As a result, in junior level sports the coaches will give the blacks more attention, since they want to win.</p>
<p>However, I really do believe if college sports were played by primarily 25-28 year olds, rather than the 18-22 year old group, that white athletes would dominate.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time I had high hopes of entering the Olympics, admittedly somewhat vain hopes. i was good in the 20Km walk and very good in the 50. I happened to be in Kenya in 1965, the first year after independence and they happened to have a 50 KM race and though out of training for some time I decided to enter. There were 167 entrants, apart from myself, 4 other whites, 3 of them from the British forces stationed there at the time. To the loud boos of the crowd the British came first, second and third, I was fourth, number five, the first black, was given a hero&rsquo;s welcome. I don&rsquo;t know where white number 5 came in, I left immediately. Though I stayed there for some years, I never again participated or even looked at any sport. To this day I watch fencing, equestrian, skating and winter sports, when it comes to track and field, football or the like I switch off. </p>

		<p>#20: I also intend to actively support Duke basketball since the coach is also a hero for defying conventional wisdom and pc for years!! He picks SMART and physically talented players. That&rsquo;s obviously a winning combo. I returned state-side from Iraq last Ocbober and my son is still in Bahrain. Thanks for your service and stay safe!!</p>

<p>I wonder how some of these players get into school.  I saw that game, too, and watched the postgame interviews on TV.  </p>
<p>God love him, he&rsquo;s probably alright and everything when it comes to being a half-decent human being.  But John Wall, University of Kentucky?  The man is dumber than a box of rocks.</p>
