<h1><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/09/news/companies/univision_hispanics_latinos.fortune/index.htm">Do Advertisers Have a Blind Spot Toward US Hispanics?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mina Kimes, CNN, April 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The network is Univision, and Cesar Conde is the young media mogul. He says he is surrounded by evidence that the very audience he exists to serve is undercounted and marginalized by both the private and public sectors, so he&rsquo;s taken to beating the drum on behalf of his viewers, starting by needling them to fill out their census forms.</p>
<p>Univision&rsquo;s flagship network is the fifth largest amongst all broadcast networks, but it&rsquo;s actually second or third amongst 18-34 year olds, according to Conde. And yes, that counts English-language competition like Fox and NBC.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>How to cash in on the census</b></p>
<p>{snip}Current census estimates place the number of Hispanics in the U.S. at 50 million, or 15% of the total population; by 2050, it&rsquo;s expected to hit 30%. Networks like Univision can leverage those numbers to lure more advertisers. {snip}</p>
<p>In his interview with Fortune, Conde, who ranked 13th on the magazine&rsquo;s 40 Under 40 last year, said that while the media has been buzzing about the exploding Hispanic market for years, advertisers have yet to match that buzz with dollars.</p>
<p>Many companies still spend &#8220;several multiples&#8221; more on marketing to European countries than they spend reaching Hispanics in the U.S., he says, despite the fact that the latter, which has $1 trillion in purchasing power, is growing much faster. &#8220;It&rsquo;s off by 10, 20, 30 times,&#8221; he says of the discrepancy. {snip}</p>
<p>The top 500 corporate advertisers in the U.S. spent 5.4% of their budgets on Hispanics last year, according to the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies  &mdash;  far less than the group&rsquo;s estimated 15% share of the population. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Media spending is tied to variables other than population size and growth  &mdash;  income, for example, plays a role in the equation. As of 2008, Hispanic households had a median income of $37,913, compared to $55,530 for non-Hispanic white households.</p>
<p>But the Hispanic market has its own unique appeal, says Conde. For one, it&rsquo;s younger. According to census data released last spring, more than a third of Hispanics are under 18 years old, compared to an overall average of 24%. Univision aims to convince advertisers that investing in a market with greater longevity will pay bigger dividends down the road.</p>
<p>While the new census data won&rsquo;t come out until spring of 2011, Conde says it&rsquo;s already piquing interest from advertisers. {snip}</p>
<p>Conde {snip} says. &#8220;The bottom line is, the growth in this country is coming from this Hispanic market. Investing in anything else is investing in static or declining parts of the economic landscape.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I think a typical American reaches the peak of his or her purchasing power from ages 40-64.  Because Hispanics tend to be younger, that&rsquo;s why they aren&rsquo;t targeted that much, yet.</p>

		<p>Marginalized? Hardly. They get free babies, rent subsidies, food stamps, jobs in place of legal citizens, welfare, and most anything they want. Why bother to make them citizens? They can game the system much better as illegals.</p>

		<p>I just love the last comments  of this genius media Mogul, Conde&rsquo;,</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is, the growth in this country is coming from this Hispanic market. Investing in anything else is investing in static or declining parts of the economic landscape.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the growth may be coming from the &#8220;Hispanic market&#8221;, but it is based on soon to be worthless credit card buying power, the socialist Obama administrations, &#8220;redistribution of wealth  schemes,(earned income credit,etc.)towards hispanics and other &#8220;protected groups&#8221;, and every kind of entitlement program which will soon collapse. For example, there are programs for low income people that give them major appliances for free, breaks on every type of utility bill, and there is massive legalized fraud,(socialism) involving states like California, where money is distributed like it was sand, through an almost countless number of state aid and other programs.  This free&rsquo;s up a lot of money for Mr. Conde&rsquo;s dreams of hispanic buying power, that would otherwise have to be used to &#8220;PAY THE BILLS&#8221;etc.</p>
<p>The government,(taxpayer)is where a lot of the buying power is coming from, that Mr. Conde&rsquo;s talking about, whether he realizes it or not. All of it could change in a heartbeat, depending on things like Tea Party movements, financial meltdowns in various industries, etc.etc., all of which would result in stopping the theft that is the distribution of wealth scams that are now going on.</p>

		<p>More evidence that non-white ethnics always see themselves as unique and different from the rest of America(especially whites), and deserving of special attantion. It puts the lie to the idea that these people just want to be a part of the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; and be like the rest of us. As if we didn&rsquo;t already know that&hellip;     </p>

<p>More of the same: Marxism mixed with a sedative dose of &ldquo;capitalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very things Comrade Cesar Conde hopes to exploit, are not an &ldquo;integration&rdquo; of markets and the peoples who sustain them, but an isolating of the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; to advantage himself. He wants, a specifically secluded linguistic group of consumers to both manipulate and dominate. If he did not, he would be encouraging these &ldquo;migrants&rdquo; and &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; to assimilate and shop at Target or Krogers; that he does not, speaks volumes, and these volumes are not to be found in the pages of &ldquo;Das Kapital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>When talking about income in terms of marketing, one must talk about disposable income and discretionary income. Conveniently omitted from these marketeer pontifications is how much Hispanic income gets dropped off at Western Union.</p>
<p>On the other hand they didn&rsquo;t mention off the books cash income either and that may very well offset what gets wired home. My own anecdotal observations of Hispanic (mostly Mexican and Central American) consumer habits in my area indicate that their consumer dollars are largely spent at:</p>
<p>Wal-Mart, Sears (Sears has upscale cachet in this market), the flea market, and ma and pa La Raza owned bodegas. Mary Kay and Herbalife seem to have some significant MLM penetration in this market too.</p>

I guess latinos and latinas don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re being pandered to enough.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;The bottom line is, the growth in this country is coming from this Hispanic market. Investing in anything else is investing in static or declining parts of the economic landscape.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Is this equivalent to black buying power? Are hispanics now going to claim, as do blacks, that their purchasing power is so vast that they must be pandered to or else?<br>

		<p>Underserved?! mexicans?! Every business I call first subjects me to a recording saying: Para espanol, marque numero dos! </p>
<p>I live in California, there are more spanish language radio stations than top 40, country and talk stations combined!</p>
<p>Sorry for all the exclaimation points, but this sickens me.</p>
<p>They want more businesses to cater to them? Fine, go the &%$# back to mexico; I understand they cater to spanish speakers down there. </p>
<p>BTW I wonder how many English language TV and radio stations exist in mexico or points south.</p>

		<p>These degenerate Mestizos send most of their money to their home countries to pay human traffickers to smuggle in all their family members and friends.  </p>
<p>Consequently they have little discretionary income to purchase the equivalent of beads and trinkets corporate America places at their feet&hellip;</p>

		<p>No, advertising for Hispanics is NOT a necessity. They do a pretty good job without advertising to guide their shoplifting.</p>
