			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shane Bacon, Yahoo! Sports, April 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Before the Masters started, Tiger Woods told us that he had changed. His outbursts would be quieted, his club tossing would be softened and he was going to be a different guy on the golf course.</p>
<p>No matter if you bought that or not, it&rsquo;s true that the weekend brought out some of the old Tiger. He screamed &#8220;Tiger, you <em>suck!,</em>&#8221; only to follow that up with a profanity unlike any other in the third round. On Sunday on the 13th hole, Woods screamed &#8220;Jesus Christ!&#8221; after a tee shot and he wasn&rsquo;t complimenting the man upstairs.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t something new with Tiger, but it is something he told us would be avoiding in the future. Jim Nantz, the voice of CBS at the Masters, had a chance to talk with Mike Francesa of WFAN on Monday, and let it be known that he wasn&rsquo;t happy with the way Woods acted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I said what he said on the air, I would be fired. I read in the USA Today and it was called &#8220;mild language.&#8221; Someone on my broadcast dismissed it as him having a camera in his face. Well, guess what? Phil Mickelson had a camera in his face all week and did you even hear him come close to approaching that? He didn&rsquo;t hit every shot the way he wanted. Have you ever heard Arnold Palmer or Jack Nicklaus use that kind of language? What are the parameters between what&rsquo;s right or wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nantz then admitted that this isn&rsquo;t something that has disturbed him in the past, but the fact that Tiger promised us a change is why it rubbed him the wrong way. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} If you&rsquo;re going to cuss when the cameras are rolling over a live broadcast, that is one thing, but when you tell us you won&rsquo;t and still do it, it sure makes you look bad. Especially for a guy trying to bulldoze his past image.</p>

		<p>Now, now, now, we need to be gentle with Tiger.  After all, according to his published autobiography, on his first day at kindergarten, there was a group of racist 6th grade boys who were waiting for him.  They tied him up, called him nasty racial names, and wrote the N-word on his body   &mdash;   very similar to what happened to Twanda Brawley. </p>
<p>However, this event was not observed by any teacher, there is no record of this event actually happening, no one has ever stepped forward and verified this event, and a teacher from Tiger&rsquo;s school claims that the story is total fabrication.  Furthermore, it is difficult to understand how the 6th graders would have had both the desire and the wherewithal to plan and conduct such an act, let alone how they would have known beforehand that a Black kid would come to school that day.  I know that on the first day of school, I was always excited about seeing my friends, what I would wear, and trying to remember how to get to my new class.  These White kids were apparently very cunning.</p>
<p>Still, we have absolutely no reason to think that Tiger is a lair, that he has severe moral shortcomings, or that Black people would ever make up stories to make White people feel guilty or to get things out of them.  Also, there is no disclaimer of this racist event in the mainstream media   &mdash;   so, it must have really happened. After all, the media would not lie to us. </p>

		<p>I think his salty mouth is the least of Woods&rsquo;s problems.  He has close links to one of those &#8220;doctors&#8221; who is known for a form of blood doping.  One could say that his affairs were personal, and his salty mouth might be a breach of decorum, and he might have peddled a racial hoax with his fake kindergarten story, but if he&rsquo;s on the juice, then he&rsquo;s affecting the integrity of the game.</p>

		<p>1:  On my blog, I advised parents of white sons who are about to enter the 6th grade to stock up on rope and spray paint right now, because there&rsquo;s going to be such a run on those two items in early August that the prices will be out of this world.  We now know that hate lies in the heart of every 11-year old white boy, and has for at least the last generation.  They very can&rsquo;t well tie up and spray paint a racial slur on an entering mixed-race kindergartner on the first day of school if they don&rsquo;t have the rope and spray paint with them to begin with.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;n not into watching sports&hellip;any of it&hellip;so I wasn&rsquo;t aware of this black&rsquo;s raging, cursing and temper tantrums.  There&rsquo;s no excuse for losing it like that, and it tells a lot about the maturity of a player.  </p>
<p>Notice that it is pointed out that Mickelson is under just as much..or more&hellip;.pressure than Woods&hellip;personally and professionally&hellip;yet he conducts himself appropriately at all times.</p>
<p>The leftist media condoned and/or ignored this bad behavior, because Woods was one of their media darlings strictly because he is black.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but get the impression, however, that this pampered black figured the best way to get his white wife back was to impress her with a big win.</p>
<p>Too bad it didn&rsquo;t work out that way.</p>

		<p>This has been tossed around before. Even before the car accident and cheating scandal. That Tiger Woods has a very loud and obnoxious mouth. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t believe the stories having never seen evidence of this before but I tend to believe it now. It is sports, however, and he&rsquo;s on the playing field more or less. </p>

		<p>Tiger has always been a foul mouth, always been aloof, has always been a horned dog, so what&rsquo;s new?</p>
<p>Nothing is new and nothing has changed apart from the fact his media cover has been blown.  </p>
<p>His blasphemous ravings have always been an affront.</p>
<p>I wish him well, I wish us well, I wish he would just go away.</p>
<p>Tiger wouldn&rsquo;t make a pimple on a &#8220;real man&rsquo;s rear&#8221;.</p>

		<p>He behaved awefully ungentlemanly for someone who made $330,000 (!) playing golf.  &#8220;I came here to win,&#8221; he said.  As it turns out, so did Phil Michelson, and anyone who can shoot 67, 67, 67 and 71 in four games didn&rsquo;t just get lucky.  I really enjoyed watching Woods turn that one-putt for an eagle into a three-put for a bogey.  Hilarious!  I made $200 betting on Michelson which I have already spent on a metal-cutting bandsaw, but watching that spoiled brat serial adulterer choke was icing on the cake.<br>

		<p>Mr. Wholesome?  The golden boy the media couldn&rsquo;t stop telling us about how squeaky-clean and universally popular/beloved/admired/worshiped he was?  This cant be!</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve said before, I&rsquo;d be driving a Buick Enclave if &#8216;Tiger&rsquo; had not been the spokesman associated with its release.  Enclave got top marks for quiet, safety, and quality.  But I could not bring myself to buy one, because when I saw an Enclave, I saw &#8216;Tiger&rsquo;.  I found the obvious cynical assumptions on GM&rsquo;s part (that all Buick buyers are either senile golf-lovers, or black&hellip;.and that &#8216;Tiger&rsquo; was white enough to please senile whites, but black enough to excite blacks&hellip;) to be too galling.  This was before &#8216;Tiger&rsquo; had his scandal, and before GM&rsquo;s bankruptcy.  I just had a bad feeling when I saw him.</p>
<p>So I bought a Lexus SUV, instead.  It&rsquo;s been okay&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, &#8216;Tiger&rsquo; was only on my radar screen because one could not open a magazine or walk past a television without seeing him in tacky Golf clothes&hellip;shoved in our faces as some sort of role-model&hellip;or something&hellip;never could figure out just what it was the marketing people were trying to tell us we were supposed to think about him&hellip;</p>
<p>I suspect that most of us are interested in his troubles only because we&rsquo;re hoping they will make him GO AWAY.  But John Lennon&rsquo;s death did not do a bit of good: we still have to listen to his smarmy songs on elevators, and in the grocery store.  And I imagine we will never hear the last of the &#8216;Tiger&rsquo; saga.</p>
<p>As to his alleged kindergarten trauma, I, too, have wondered where the sixth-graders would have gotten rope and spray paint.  </p>
