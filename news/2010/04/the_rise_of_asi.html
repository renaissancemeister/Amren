<h1><a href="/ar/2009/09/index.html#cover">The Rise of Asian Race Consciousness</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nguyen Ai Quoc, American Renaissance, September 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>        <p> <span class="dropcap">A</span>sian-Americans have long been known as the &ldquo;model minority.&rdquo; This is for two reasons. First, only a few Asian groups suffer from the social problems associated with blacks and Hispanics. Second, Asians have not made forceful demands on American society in the name of race. They have stayed away from identity politics and generally tried to assimilate. </p><table class="boxright"><tr><td><img src="/ar/2009/09/01a-Asia_Characters.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="639"> </td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption"> Chinese characters for &ldquo;Asia.&rdquo; </th></tr></table><p> The first of these reasons for being a &ldquo;model&rdquo; shows no sign of changing. With the exception of a few small groups such as the Hmong and certain Pacific Islanders, Asians continue to be hardworking, successful, and law-abiding. However, the past few decades have seen a marked increase in the willingness of Asians to band together across ethnic lines and to make demands in the name of race. Rather than trying to melt into the majority society as they did during the post-war period, Asians are beginning to adopt the tactics that other groups have shown to be successful. They are not nearly so focused on racial identity as blacks or Hispanics, but a group that showed every sign of downplaying the significance of race  &mdash;  of genuinely trying to assimilate  &mdash;  is now moving in the opposite direction. </p></p>
<p>        <p> No doubt this is partly explained by the increase in the number of Asians. When minority communities grow they exert a powerful attraction on their members that fosters parochial loyalties. At the same time, when other minorities turn their backs on assimilation and carve out alternative identities for themselves  &mdash;  and gain clear advantages from doing so  &mdash;  the temptation to do likewise is strong. </p>      &ldquo;Our parents told us don&rsquo;t make a fuss, stay out of the public, eye,&rdquo; explains Frank Wu, an Asian-American activist and law professor at Howard University, &ldquo;but that advice serves no purpose in a diverse democracy.&rdquo; It serves no purpose when every other group is making a fuss and pushing clearly ethnic interests. </p></p>
<p>        <p> The term &ldquo;model minority&rdquo; has been under attack for some time, but not from the people you might expect. It would be logical for blacks and Hispanics to object to the term, since it implies that they are less desirable minorities, but they are not the critics. It is the younger generation of Asians who now spurn a label that made their elders proud. </p><br>
<strong>Who are the Asians?</strong> </p></p>
<p>Asians are still a small minority  &mdash;  at 13.4 million they are 4.4 percent of the population, according to the Census Bureau estimate of 2007  &mdash;  but their impact is vastly disproportionate to their numbers. Forty-four percent of Asian-American adults have a college degree or higher, as opposed to only 24 percent of the general population. Asian men have median earnings 10 percent higher than non-Asian men, and that of Asian women is 15 percent higher than non-Asian women. Forty-five percent of Asians are employed in professional or management jobs as opposed to 34 percent for the country as a whole, and the figure is no less than 60 percent for Asian Indians. </p>The Information Technology Association of America estimates that in the high-tech workforce Asians are represented at three times their proportion of the population. Asians are also more likely than the American average to own homes rather than be renters. These successes are especially remarkable because no fewer than 69 percent of Asians are foreign-born, and immigrant groups have traditionally taken several generations to reach full potential. </p></p>
<p>        <table class="quoteright"><tr><th> &ldquo;Assimiliation serves no purpose in a diverse democracy.&rdquo; </th></tr></table></p>
<p>        <p> It is a mistake, however, to paint all Asians with the same brush. Chinese (24 percent of the total) and Indians (16 percent) are extremely successful, as are Japanese and Koreans. Filipinos (18 percent) are somewhat less so, and the Hmong significantly less so. Hmong earn 30 percent less than the national average, and 60 percent drop out of high school. In the Seattle public schools, 80 percent of Japanese-American students passed Washington state&rsquo;s standardized math test for 10th-graders  &mdash;  the highest pass rate for any ethnic group. The group with the lowest pass rate  &mdash;  14 percent  &mdash;  was another &ldquo;Asian Pacific Islanders&rdquo; category: Samoans. </p> <p> Different Asian nationalities can therefore have very distinctive profiles. For example, 40 percent of the manicurists in the United States are of Vietnamese origin and half the motel rooms in the country are owned by Asian Indians. On the whole, however, Asians have a well-deserved reputation for high achievement. </p><table class="boxleft"><tr><td><img src="/ar/2009/09/03a-Asian_Doctors.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="202"> </td></tr><tr> <th class="photocaption"> High-achieving Asians. </th></tr></table><p> Asians are vastly overrepresented at the best American universities. Although less than 5 percent of the population, they account for the following percentages of the student bodies of these universities: Harvard: 17 percent, Yale: 13 percent, Princeton: 12 percent, Columbia: 14 percent, Stanford: 25 percent. In California, the state with the largest number of Asians, they made up 14 percent of the 2005 high-school graduating class but 42 percent of the freshmen on the campuses of the University of California system. At Berkeley, the most selective of all the campuses, the 2005 freshman class was an astonishing 48 percent Asian. </p>Asians are also the least likely of any racial or ethnic group to commit crimes. In every category, whether violent crime, white-collar crime, alcohol, or sex offenses, they are arrested at about one-quarter to one-third the rate of whites, who are the next-most law-abiding group. (A 2005 New Century Foundation report, <em>The Color of Crime,</em> found that Asians are many times more likely than whites to be members of youth gangs, so Asian crime rates may start climbing.) There is one exception: gambling. Chinese, in particular, are heavy gamblers but so are Vietnamese, Filipinos, Cambodians, and Koreans. Asians as a group are three to four times more likely than whites to be arrested for gambling offenses and a 1999 poll in San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown found that 70 percent of respondents said gambling was the community&rsquo;s number-one problem. </p><p> Asians are, in fact, such an important factor in the gambling business that after the MGM Grand Hotel &amp; Casino opened in Las Vegas in 1993, it spent millions of dollars redesigning its entrance. It had been built to look like the mouth of a lion, the company&rsquo;s logo, but many Asians would not enter the building because they thought it was bad luck to walk into the jaws of a beast. </p><p> <strong>Pan-Asian Identity</strong> </p><p> Asian immigrants started coming to the United States in the 1850s, and Asians have a rich history in North America. Like many other immigrant communities, they established self-help and other associations along national lines. These organizations fought discrimination but were mainly vehicles for mutual assistance, not the cultivation of a racial identity or the pursuit of political power. Recently, however, there is a clear tendency to establish broadly Asian organizations that are essentially expressions of racial solidarity. </p><table class="boxright"><tr> <td><img src="/ar/2009/09/03b-MGM_Grand.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="207"> </td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption"> MGM rebuilt the entrance to suit the Chinese. </th></tr></table> <p> Don Nakanishi, director of the UCLA Asian American Studies Center, explains that this is a burgeoning trend, especially in politics. What he calls a &ldquo;pan-Asian&rdquo; perspective is increasingly common, with Asians funneling money and votes to candidates who are of the same race but may be of a different national origin. </p><p> &ldquo;A lot of it has to do with maximizing their political clout,&rdquo; explains demographer William Frey. &ldquo;They want to identify themselves as a pan-Asian group rather than segment themselves &hellip; It makes sense for Asians to band together.&rdquo; It makes sense because there is strength in numbers and because race is a common bond. </p><p> OCA is the name of an influential Asian-American organization that grants scholarships only to Asian students and makes awards to outstanding Asian-American business executives. It was founded in 1973 as the Organization of Chinese Americans, but as part of its current pan-Asian emphasis, it is now known almost exclusively by its initials. When C.C. Yin, a San Francisco businessman, recently started an organization to nurture future political leaders, he did not limit it to Chinese, but called it the Asian Pacific Islander American Political Association. </p><p> Typical of the recent trend is a glossy magazine called <em>AsianAm</em> that was scheduled for launch in 2009. According to its mission statement, it was to be &ldquo;the One Voice for all Asian cultures.&rdquo; Likewise, when the Asian Real Estate Association of America opened a chapter in Las Vegas in 2008, its president, John Fukuda, noted that although Las Vegas has a section called Chinatown, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really Asiatown.&rdquo; Asians of all nationalities feel comfortable there. </p><p> There is no doubt that Asians are drawn to other Asians. Irvine, California, which used to be a typical white, conservative suburb, was 37 percent Asian in 2006, and has become a place where one need never speak English. Chinese are the most numerous Asian group, but Irvine also attracts Koreans, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Asians continue to increase in numbers and many schools have become heavily Asian. The University of California at Irvine (UCI) was 40 percent Asian in 2007 and sometimes jokingly referred to as the University of Chinese Immigrants. </p><table class="boxcenter"><tr><td><img src="/ar/2009/09/04a-monolid.jpg" alt="Monolid magazine" width="576" height="479"> </td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption"> An angry magazine that never found a market. </th></tr></table><p> Businesses have followed Asian communities, offering services in Asian languages and providing the comfort that comes from dealing with fellow ethnics. In 2006, two Chinese-oriented banks, Cathay General Bancorp and East West Bancorp were the second- and third-largest banks in Los Angeles County. Both started in Chinatown and moved out with their customers. Both were pursuing Asian customers in other states as well. </p><p> Asian identity seldom takes on the hostile, anti-white tone common with blacks and Hispanics, but it is not entirely absent. In 1997, Vietnamese-born Peter Nguyen was president of the UCLA Law School student bar association. To a suggestion that California had taken in too many immigrants, he replied, &ldquo;Be warned: There is a lot of diversity here, and if you don&rsquo;t like it, there are 49 other states and plenty of islands&rdquo; to move to. </p><p> At about the same time, there were reports of Asians in high schools in Santa Clara County, California, who had joined gang-like groups called &ldquo;Asian Pride.&rdquo; They took collective revenge against slights from whites, did not socialize with whites, and harassed other Asians who did. They had an explicitly Asian identity, with a mix of members: Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Filipinos. This tendency does not, however, appear to be nearly so widespread or hard-edged as the racial identification of school-aged blacks and Hispanics. </p><table class="boxright"><tr><td><img src="/ar/2009/09/04b-Mixed_Marriage.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="337"> </td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption"> &ldquo;I think we should f  &mdash;  in&rsquo; kill them all.&rdquo; </th></tr></table><p> In 2000, a Chinese-American named Carrie Chang started an angry magazine for Asians called <em>Monolid.</em> In language that seemed borrowed from black racial consciousness, the magazine urged all Asians to &ldquo;rise up and grasp their identity&rdquo; so as to fight &ldquo;that ugly racism which is accosting us at every moment.&rdquo; One of Miss Chang&rsquo;s favorite themes was the need for Asian women to stop dating white men. About three-fourths of white-Asian marriages involve white men and Asian women, and according to C.N. Le, a Vietnamese-American who teaches sociology at the University of Massachusetts, &ldquo;Some of the men view the women marrying whites as sellouts.&rdquo; </p>      <p> <em>Monolid</em> took a more militant view. One article quoted Samuel Lin, a student at University of California at Berkeley, who deeply resented white men who dated Asians. &ldquo;I think we should f  &mdash;  in&rsquo; kill them all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Stick to your own flavor.&rdquo; More significant than the aggressive tone of <em>Monolid</em> is the fact that it could not find a market. It lasted only a year or two. </p><p> Another representative difference between Asian and black identity can be found in Congress. There has been a Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus since 1994, but unlike the black caucus, it admits non-Asians whose districts include large numbers of Asian-Pacific constituents. White representatives from Hawaii and Guam have been members. </p><p><strong>The non-white mainstream</strong></p><p> Asians are nevertheless joining the non-white mainstream when it comes to making demands in the name of race. In 2000, for example, Asian actors were complaining that they were underrepresented in casting decisions and that they were too often typecast as martial arts experts or seductresses. Counting right down to tenths of a percent, they argued that since they were 3.8 percent of the population, they deserved more than 2.2 percent of the television and movie roles. &ldquo;We are depriving children of knowledge of the world we live in by not providing them with an accurate portrayal of the American scene,&rdquo; said Chinese-American actor Jack Ong. <em>Asian Week</em> complained that in Hollywood movies &ldquo;the heroic Caucasian protagonist saves the helpless people of color.&rdquo; </p> <p> Asians have also begun to act more like blacks and Hispanics on college campuses. In 2000, 100 Asian students demonstrated on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago, demanding establishment of an Asian-American studies program, an Asian cultural center, and a special academic support network for Asians. They were also furious because the university had put out a press release bragging it had received an award for supporting diversity  &mdash;  but had failed to mention Asians. &ldquo;We will not tolerate being treated that way,&rdquo; said Haley Nalik, president of the Coalition for Asian American Studies. </p><p> In California, which has by far the largest number of Asian university students, activists were frustrated by the assumption that Asians were doing well and did not need special assistance. They pointed out that Bangladeshis and Malaysians, as well as islanders from Guam and Tonga were underrepresented on campuses, and demanded that administrators stop pretending Asians as a group were successful. In what is becoming an increasingly typical pan-Asian approach, the overrepresented Asians, such as Chinese and Koreans, insisted that the smaller ethnicities be counted separately and be more aggressively recruited if they were underrepresented. In 2007, the University of California system agreed to start counting no fewer than 23 Asian and Pacific Islander categories to ensure than no one gets short shrift. </p><table class="boxleft"><tr><td><img src="/ar/2009/09/05a-Chinks_Steaks.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="191"> </td></tr> <tr> <th class="photocaption"> Not to be tolerated. </th></tr></table><p> Increasingly, like &ldquo;non-model&rdquo; minorities, Asians keep a sharp eye out for perceived slights, as the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) discovered in 2008. Interviews, endorsements, socializing with sponsors, and professional-amateur rounds are important sources of revenue for the LPGA Tour, and organizers announced that players would not be allowed to compete if they did not speak English well enough to take part. Asian organizations immediately went on the offensive, and Asian-American state legislators in California threatened to pass a law that would ban such a policy in California. The LPGA quickly backed down. I&rsquo;m pleased they have come to their senses,&rdquo; said California assemblyman Ted Lieu. </p><p> In 2008, CNN commentator Jack Cafferty complained that China made &ldquo;junk with lead paint&rdquo; and exported &ldquo;poisoned pet food,&rdquo; and called Chinese leaders &ldquo;basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they&rsquo;ve been for the last 50 years.&rdquo; This prompted throngs of Chinese to gather outside CNN offices in Hollywood to demand that he be fired. They sang the Chinese national anthem and waved Chinese and Taiwanese flags, in a demonstration that drew both mainland and Nationalist Chinese. </p><p> Joseph Groh, the owner of a popular Philadelphia restaurant, was proud of keeping things the way they were since the diner was founded in 1959  &mdash;  the same soda fountain, ceiling fans, sparse menu, and wooden booths. Asians, however, were offended because he kept the restaurant&rsquo;s original name  &mdash;  Chink&rsquo;s  &mdash;  the nickname of the man who started it. For years, Asians pressured Mr. Groh to change the name, but he refused. In 2008, Asians succeeded in persuading a city agency to deny a lease for a second location. &ldquo;We actually stopped it [the restaurant] from expanding,&rdquo; said Tsiwen Law, general counsel of the Greater Philadelphia OCA. &ldquo;Going outside of his neighborhood will be difficult, because we will respond,&rdquo; he added. </p><table class="boxcenter"><tr><td><img src="/ar/2009/09/05b-miley_cyrus_asian_pic.jpg" alt="." width="576" height="369"> </td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption"> Miley Cyrus, third from left. </th>    </tr></table><p> In 2009, OCA also slammed the singer Miley Cyrus for what it claimed was gross insensitivity to Asians. A snapshot of the then-16-year-old taken with a group of friends showed her and several others pulling their eyes into a slanted position that is supposed to look Asian. A Los Angeles Asian-American, Lucie Kim, went even further, filing a civil rights claim for $4 billion in compensation for all Asian-Americans. </p><p> Actions of this kind, which have been staples of black and Hispanic activism, would have been unthinkable to Asian leaders of a generation ago. </p><p> Like the larger minorities, Asians are also beginning to push racial-ethnic interests in politics. Gautam Dutta is executive director of the Asian-American Action Fund. &ldquo;Historically, they [Asians] are less focused on politics,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but they are an emerging bloc, suddenly in the last few years in both state and national elections.&rdquo; </p><p> The California state legislature has had an Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus since 2001, and it joined the black and Hispanic caucuses in threatening to cut off funding for the state judicial system if Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did not appoint more non-white judges. Caucus member Ted Lieu argued that it was manifestly unfair that although Asian-Americans made up 12.6 percent of the state&rsquo;s population, they represented only 4.6 percent of the governor&rsquo;s 260 judicial appointments. (He was unconcerned by the fact that the state bar, from which all appointments must come, was 85 percent white.) He also introduced legislation that would require the state to keep track of 21 different Asian ethnicities to make sure less successful groups were getting the attention they need. &ldquo;To the extent that I can help out on issues statewide affecting Asian Pacific Americans, I&rsquo;m going to try and do that,&rdquo; he explained. </p><table class="boxright"><tr><td><img src="/ar/2009/09/05c-Stereotype.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="130"> </td></tr><tr>           <th class="photocaption"> No stereotypes please. </th></tr></table><p> Some more-recently-arrived Asian groups are not yet at the pan-Asian level of organization and make narrowly ethnic political appeals. In 2007, two independent Vietnamese candidates set off what was called a &ldquo;political earthquake&rdquo; by beating both the Republican and Democratic candidates  &mdash;  one white, the other Hispanic  &mdash;  for a place on the powerful Orange County, California, Board of Supervisors. As the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> explained, the Vietnamese upset the favorites by clever use of absentee ballots and by &ldquo;shrewdly courting ethnic loyalties.&rdquo; Vietnamese were pleased. &ldquo;All candidates should know by now they can&rsquo;t win an election around here without the support of the Vietnamese community,&rdquo; said Lan Nguyen, president of the Garden Grove Unified School District Board of Trustees. </p><p> That same year, the Orange County town of Westminster became the first in the nation to have a city council that was majority Vietnamese. They were not a majority of voters  &mdash;  under 40 percent  &mdash;  but they voted overwhelmingly for fellow ethnics while non-Vietnamese split their votes among a number of candidates. The county&rsquo;s white and Hispanic politicians began translating campaign literature into Vietnamese and posing for photos with the yellow and red flag of the former country of South Vietnam  &mdash;  a gesture that appeals to those who fled the Communists. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in central Orange County you can be a successful elected official without the Vietnamese vote,&rdquo; said state senator Louis Correa of Santa Ana, who hired Vietnamese-American staffers and even took part in a hunger strike to protest human rights abuses in Vietnam. </p><table class="boxcenter"><tr><br>
            <td><img src="/ar/2009/09/06a-Orange_County_CA.jpg" alt="." width="576" height="322"> </td></tr><tr> <th class="photocaption"> Orange County politics  &mdash;  count the Vietnamese flags. </th></tr></table><p> Some Asian office-holders, however, are discovering the limits of single-ethnicity politics. In San Jose, California, Madison Nguyen became the standard bearer for the Vietnamese community when she was elected in 2006 to the city council on the strength of a massive ethnic vote. Three years later she was fighting for her political life after Vietnamese voters  &mdash;  30 percent of the electorate  &mdash;  turned on her because she would not stick to a narrowly Vietnamese agenda. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say yes all the time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just a daughter in the Vietnamese-American community alone.&rdquo; Vietnamese voters felt betrayed. Her opponents put a recall petition on the ballot, but in March 2009, Miss Nguyen kept her seat with 55 percent of the vote. </p><p> Asian Indians are organizing politically as well. Approximately one-third of the population of the New York City suburb of Edison is Indian, and politicians take notice. Sikhs have won election to low-level offices in New York City, and the Sikh Coalition managed to get a bill pending in the city council to allow city employees to wear turbans. The American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin is now the biggest doctors&rsquo; group in the nation after the American Medical Association. </p><br>
        <table class="boxleft"><tr><td><img src="/ar/2009/09/06b-Madison_Nguyen.jpg" alt="Madison Nguyen" width="324" height="419"> </td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption"> Madison Nguyen  &mdash;  great yellow hope? </th></tr>        </table><p> At the pan-Asian level, the most successful political force is probably the 80-20 initiative, established in 1998 with the aim of delivering a massive Asian vote  &mdash;  80 percent of it  &mdash;  to candidates who agree to its demands. Its founders include S.R. Woo, former lieutenant governor of Delaware, and Chang-lin Tien, former chancellor of UC Berkeley, hardly people who failed to get a foothold in the mainstream. </p><p> National politicians take 80-20 seriously. During the 2004 presidential elections, nine of the 11 candidates, including John Kerry, John Edwards, Howard Dean, Joseph Lieberman, and Dennis Kucinich, signed an 80-20 statement saying that if elected they would order the Labor Department to hold public hearings on discrimination against Asians, and would meet with Asian leaders to discuss progress in combating such discrimination. </p><p> For the 2008 election, Chris Dodd, Joe Biden, and Mike Gravel agreed to the 2004 pledge but went further, promising to appoint enough Asian-American judges to triple their number on the bench and to consider appointing an Asian to the Supreme Court. John Edwards, Bill Richardson, and Hillary Clinton signed a statement agreeing to keep appointing Asians &ldquo;until the current dismal situation is significantly remedied.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is the secret that 80-20 can get such perfect answers from presidential candidates?&rdquo; asked the 80-20 website. &ldquo;Its ability to deliver a bloc vote!&rdquo; More and more politicians are finding that Asians are yet another pressure group whose demands must not be ignored. </p><p> Asians have many interests they want their representatives to push  &mdash;  celebration of Asian holidays, open immigration policies, foreign-policy considerations  &mdash;  but one of the most consistent is that Asians be included in minority set-asides for government contracting. The fact that most Asian groups are economically more successful than non-Asians does not reduce their enthusiasm for these programs. <!-- #bbinclude "textend.incl" -->

		<p>Japanese characters.  The Traditional Chinese form is 亞洲 and the Simplified is 亚洲.  Though, Japan, to my knowledge, tends to use the katakana アジア.</p>
<p>亜 is a Japanese specific simplification of 亞 and 州 actually means &#8220;state&#8221; rather than &#8220;continent&#8221;, which is 洲.  Of course this is all very confusing because 州 and 洲 have the exact same pronunciation in Mandarin (zhōu) and the only difference in the characters is the water radical at the beginning of the continent form.</p>

		<p>As an asian american I want to put my two cents in, I believe that oftentimes asian americans end up inadvertently becoming the whipping boy for the white majority due to the fact that whites are unable to call out blacks or hispanics, thus when an issue comes up involving asian americans whites are not hesitant to come down on them. One example being the aforementioned golf debacle regarding foreign languages. Whites wouldn&rsquo;t even try to attempt doing this to any other group for obvious reasons, but when it comes to asian people&hellip; Even in highschool I would notice this phenomena, typically the white kids would be overly kind to the black kids, but wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate poking fun at asian kids, and occasionally the white and black kids would team up in their efforts to antagonize the asians. (I want to add though that this was not an everyday occurrence where I went to school, and most of the white kids I went to school with were very friendly; but there were a certain portion of the white student body who were less elevated to say the least.) Regarding the issue of asian consciousness though, I feel that it may be due in part to collective resentment towards being singled out by through a racial double standard carried out through white people. On behalf of white people, I believe that that kind of behavior shows a lack of backbone; in that whites would be willing to call out asians, but will under no circumstances do the same towards blacks or hispanics. Do you all pretty much understand what i&rsquo;m trying to say?</p>
<p>As for the other aspects of the asian consciousness movement&hellip;honestly I think its quite silly. For the most part it just strikes me as a reactionary movement, nothing more, nothing less. If there is one thing I have noticed its that asians as a race, tend towards greater intelligence but inherently lack individuality. Lack of individuality typically lends itself towards a &#8216;follower&rsquo; mindset. I believe that this is being reflected here, asian americans want to emulate other racial groups but therein lies the crux of the problem; they are ultimately still in the mold of follower. They see other (racial) groups and they want to copy them; but there&rsquo;s no actual, original, genuine impetus to do so. Its only because they&rsquo;ve seen it been done, so they want to do it too. To me personally, something about the asian consciousness movement just seems fake, phony. I suspect that this may be why, asian americans simply trying to create their own simulacrum of cultural institutions seen in other racial groups, without bothering to try to find their own actual &#8220;core&#8221;. But yeah, its sad to see asians get caught up in all this chicanery. sheesh</p>

		<p>&#8220;It serves no purpose when every other group is making a fuss and pushing clearly ethnic interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>White people cannot say something this obvious, of course, without being branded a racist.</p>
<p>I live in a neighborhood that is RAPIDLY Asia-fying.  Chinese and Korean are the big groups.  They make up about 50% of my neighborhood now.  Yes, the Asians are hard working, law abiding and make decent neighbors - I&rsquo;ll not begrudge their decency.</p>
<p>The only thing is that they do not socialize with others who are not of their exact group.  For example, Koreans and Chinese here lead separate lives, even though their people are mingled.  Except for the ubiquitous white guy/asian female pairing, there is likewise no real white/Asian social interaction beyond pleasantries.</p>
<p>Of course, if any other racial group moved in in such huge numbers, like if suddenly all the neighbors around me were MExican, it would be the same thing.  But at least with the Latinos there is, funny to say, more cultural knowledge and such.  (Same alphabet, many similar words, closer proximity to Latin America, more cultural familiarity). </p>
<p>With someone from China or Cambodia there is often zero to latch on to so the social cohesion is even less.  Just like the &#8220;Bowling alone&#8221; author found in his book, America is dissolving socially and at some point it will devolve into racially based mini territories.</p>
<p>White people can always find some room anywhere, even among Asians and Latinos, but Blacks will have a big problem in the future when they are squeezed further and further by the crush of tens of millions of Mexicans.</p>

<p>When you can have a simple assault charge turn into a federal felony and serious years of jail time because you used the n-word while beating up a black guy who started a fight with you, then you can come back to me and say I have a double standard.  </p>
<p>I see a number of &#8220;less elevated&#8221; Asians every day with half their teeth missing and foot-long hairs growing out of moles on their neck.  I&rsquo;ve had far more race-fueled altercations with Filipinos and Samoans here in Seattle than blacks.  Blacks and whites here largely get along fine until the NAACP realizes it and gets on the news to fabricate some shenanigans.</p>
<p>The reason why there&rsquo;s this rising aggrieved Asian attitude is because those immigrants who worked so hard to make something of themselves and assimilate, their chilren now make up nearly 50 percent of UC students.  And you can only imagine what kind of garbage they&rsquo;re learning there. </p>

		<p>Here in Canada, East Asians (particularly the Chinese) have integrated well. They&rsquo;re peaceful, hard-working and contribute to Canadian prosperity. In Toronto, the Chinese community is just as noticeable as the Italian and Greek communities; all of which has added to the cosmopolitan nature that the city is famous for. The only difference is that they aren&rsquo;t White. </p>
<p>Race politics in the US, coupled with a lingering belief that they aren&rsquo;t fully accepted, is forcing Asian-Americans to follow suit with those who advocate extensively for race-based rewards (e.g, blacks, hispanics etc). So, &#8220;Asian dude&#8221;, this new Asian consciousness that you perceive as being &#8220;fake&#8221; is simply a reluctance. Asians believe in meritocracy, not handouts; and I don&rsquo;t think they expect anything from the White majority other than to be treated the same as anyone else.   </p>

		<p>#2 Asian Dude, I am white and you are right in that many whites are indeed overly kind to black kids while being less kind to not just Asians but to fellow whites.  Whites are encouraged to turn against other whites kids. This happens not only at the school level, but it happens in adulthood.  </p>
<p>For instance, if blacks start a black-only organization, that effort will often be openly abetted by school officials and accepted by other students.  If Asians start an Asian-only organization, most schools will be neutral.</p>
<p>But if white kids start a white-only organization (a rare occasion), the school officials (white and black) will become rabidly hysterical.<br>

		<p>A Pan-Asian grouping is a lie. It&rsquo;s insulting. I am Chinese and I and most other Chinese refuse to be grouped with Vietnamese or Filipinos or Malays or other southeast Asians or Pacific Islanders. They are below us in every measurable category from intelligence to socioeconomic status to rates of criminality. </p>
<p>This Pan-Asian grouping has never and will never find a large following in the Chinese community. It will always just be a fringe element. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the truth: </p>
<p>Chinese only recognize four races as their equals. Jews, Japanese, Koreans, and Whites. </p>
<p>And not all Whites. Only INTELLIGENT Whites. The average White IQ is 100. In my estimation, Chinese people will only recognize as equals, those Whites with an IQ of at least 100 or above. What does this mean? </p>
<p>This means that Chinese view those Whites with an IQ less than 100 as their inferiors. </p>
<p>This means that only 50% of Whites are worthy as equals in the eyes of us Chinese. </p>
<p>Chinese people greatly value intelligence. </p>
<p>Let me reemphasize. Half of all White people in the world are viewed as inferior by the Chinese. The other half (IQ at 100 or greater) are viewed as equals, or in cases of high IQ, as superiors. </p>
<p>If you are White and have a high IQ (130+), then Chinese people will view you as their superior. Same with Jews, Japanese, and Koreans. </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

		<p>With regards to Chinese youth in gangs, this is unfortunate. </p>
<p>Understand though, that they are, in the Chinese community, highly shunned and demonized. </p>
<p>What you will find, if you were to look, is that Chinese youth in gangs tend to be those Chinese on the lower end of the intelligence bell curve. They are the dregs of Chinese people. </p>
<p>We Chinese hate low intelligence Chinese. And if they join gangs, the rest of us Chinese secretly would have no qualms with society jailing them for the rest of their lives, or even killing them. </p>
<p>Low intelligence Chinese who join gangs are viewed to be on the same level with low intelligence violent blacks, and are equally reviled. </p>
<p>Chinese have littler tolerance for people of low intelligence with violent tendencies, no matter the race. </p>

		<p>I think Asians starting so called China-Towns is a normal progression of things to come.  As this article points out, as the Asian population increases, the Asain racial consciousness has intensified.  There are advantages to racial consciousness, and it is somewhat natural.</p>
<p>Racial consciousness is actually the norm, and white repudiation of racial consciousness for the past forty years is unnatural and will only accelerate the displacement of whites.  </p>
<p>Asians acutally have an advantage over whites in that they can simply drop their self-imposed restraint on racial consciousness.  Whites, however, will need to overcome active resistance from brainwashed whites, liberals, and radical feminists.  You can have an Asian Congressional Caucus, but not a White Caucus.</p>
<p>Asian neighborhoods don&rsquo;t actively import blacks into their neighborhoods by hiring them.  Whites, however, will recruit blacks into a white neighborhood with section 8 housing, AA hiring, etc.  The AA laws seem to target white neighborhoods, schools, businesses, etc.</p>
<p>When whites finally abandon the folly of AA, civil unrest will ensue and the U.S. will break into ethnostates. </p>

		<p>With regards to Chinese girls dating White guys, this is a result of the priorities of many Chinese families. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the top two of a list in order of importance for desired traits and personal characteristics for many young Chinese people in America who are now of dating age: </p>
<p>1. Person has to have High Intelligence.<br>
2. Person needs to be Chinese</p>
<p>For the most part, if a Chinese girl brings home a White guy to meet her parents, and the White guy is of high intelligence (and is going to Harvard, for example) the Chinese parents will have no problems with the relationship, and will even encourage the dating. </p>
<p>However, if the same Chinese girl brings home a White guy to her parents, and he&rsquo;s a below-100-IQ nobody, the Chinese parents might consider disowning her. </p>
<p>We Chinese are very attracted to intelligence. Intelligence, in this case, is more important than race. </p>

		<p>I apologize if the way my comment was worded may have offended some people here, that was not my intention. I think that my particular angle may have been misinterpreted. Basically I am saying that from the Asian American point of view, its really irritating that white people will come down on Asians, but not blacks or Hispanics. I.E. I was at a strip club one time with some black friends, and at this particular strip club you&rsquo;re not supposed to have your cellphone out. (I assume because they don&rsquo;t want you taking pictures of the girls) Anyways, all of us had our cell phones out at some point, but the (white) bouncer only saw fit to single me out to tell me to put my cell phone away. I understand the basic reasoning behind this; basically you are generally going to have less problems telling an Asian person to follow the rules as opposed to a black person. And yes, I&rsquo;m well aware that the slight was extremely minor; however this kind of event does happen with some frequency to me so I&rsquo;m pretty adept at realizing whats really going on. The reason that I am sharing this anecdote is because I want to enlighten the readers here about some of the possible motivations behind the emergence of an Asian race consciousness movement. And yes #4, I&rsquo;m aware that the white double standard with regards to hate crime is much more severe; that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it makes my original point totally irrelevant. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that the liberal zombie, MSM brainwashed, PC white people need to either come down equally on everybody, or come down on nobody. Its pretty pathetic that those types of white people only have the guts to come down on Asians while blatantly ignoring the rest. Obviously&hellip;those kinds of white people probably don&rsquo;t include the readers at AMREN. I apologize for not making that distinction earlier. In a nutshell, white PC, liberal nutcases have no scruples, and constantly talk about equality but will back down on practicing that as soon as it puts them in an uncomfortable situation. I believe that we can all agree to that. Again, sorry if anybody misinterpreted what I was trying to say earlier.</p>
<p>#6, I get the impression that you don&rsquo;t actually believe I&rsquo;m Asian? And that you take offense to my assertion that the Asian Race Consciousness movement is fake? As I understand it you believe that the ARCM is basically trying to fight against racial preferences and struggle to reinstate meritocracy; from reading the article above I perceived it as anything but. To me it seems like the ARCM is being hijacked by the same despicable race hustlers that have proliferated for years in similar black/Hispanic consciousness movements. Furthermore, if you are familiar with the racial realism theme here at AMREN then perhaps you could accept that maybe what I&rsquo;m saying has a large grain of truth to it; that being that Asians are more behaviorally prone towards being less individualistic. Essentially this boils down to being more of a follower, as opposed to a leader. A tendency to copy rather than to innovate. To me this ARCM is nothing more than an attempt to try to emulate what has already been done. For that, I have very little respect for it; not that I ever had much respect for most racial advocacy groups anyways. So yes, I stick by my original assertions, the ARCM is pretty much a fake. I highly doubt that they seek to reinstate meritocracy, to me it seems like they just want a piece of the race baiters&rsquo; lottery. This will be especially prevalent with the newer generation, being brainwashed by the nonsense that&rsquo;s being shown on tv these days. <br>

<p>Interesting observation. I&rsquo;ve always felt that the Toronto Chinese community was far better established than many American communities. Of course, one would have to listen to their private conversations to know how the situation really is (from personal experience, East Asians have a strong sense of &#8220;separateness&#8221; even when we are well-assimilated).</p>

		<p>Anonymous is on to something: this is likely partly the result of the schools training Asians to be more ethnic oriented. I went to a school with a high concentration of Asians and males (take a guess at what type of school) and can recall Asians getting excited (angry) about a lecture on white&rsquo;s being racist and other events at the school. They can be very nationalistic, which is good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally an advocate of Chesterton&rsquo;s sense of Patriotism: a distinct nation in each land. I look forward to post-Balkanisation, once its over - and it is inevitable, the later the worse it&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p>I cherish a true diversity of nations, and I hope northeast Asians will stand with whites as a civilised race that resists absorption into the third world mass of untouchables. Will Asians be ethnically cleansed, or will they persevere? I&rsquo;m hoping for the latter, and I&rsquo;m hoping whites survive as well.</p>
<p>White / Asian pairing should not be tolerated by either supranation.</p>

		<p>Canada has a higher percentage of Asians than the United States to draw experience from, and the pan-Asian unity up here seems to be simply a marriage of convenience.</p>
<p>In the 20-30 years since they took over a formerly white neighborhood in Ottawa, the development of &#8216;Chinatown&rsquo; has evolved, not organically, but as a &#8216;show-the-flag&rsquo; exercise for Chinese dominance. </p>
<p>The Koreans, Japanese and Vietnamese seem wary of Chinese leadership, but they hold their tongues because they&rsquo;re hoping to cash in from being under the umbrella.</p>
<p>The Chinese are boldly stating they&rsquo;re in charge, by master-minding the creation of a towering Chinese-themed arch over the entrance to the rudimentary Ottawa &#8216;Chinatown&rsquo;, which in reality consists of a mixed neighborhood with a few claptrap Asian-owned stores and restaurants.</p>
<p>It even took a white man to spearhead the branding of the neighborhood with signage, and white taxpayers to put up the seed money for the gateway arch. I suspect inter-Asian rivalry prevents them from successfully pooling resources. </p>

If it weren&rsquo;t for asians, small business in many inner cities would be completely non-existent.   They are not only the model minority, they are the epitome of model citizens with lower criminal offender rates and higher average tax rates than any other racial sector.   We should tank God they&rsquo;re here.   And any white who picks on asians while kissing up to blacks is just a coward living the herd mentality. </p>

<p>I suspect that what you&rsquo;re observing may be a sort of backhanded acknowledgement by some whites that Asians don&rsquo;t need coddling or anyone making excuses for them.  They&rsquo;re smart, productive, and in truth the white kids have trouble keeping up with them. Thus, they often get the same sort of rough treatment that overachieving white kids used to get (and probably still do) long ago when I was young student.</p>
<p>Blacks, in truth, are very often handicapped intellectually, and for that reason people trod carefully around them, just as they wouldn&rsquo;t make light of a child with a speaking disorder.</p>
<p>I spent two years of my otherwise mis-spent youth working with Vietnamese and montagnard (mostly Rhade) tribesmen. Even with the inevitable language barrier their ability to assimilate and understand complex training subjects astounded me. They could be turned into mortar crewmen, and learn how to operate the fire direction center more quickly than your typical American trainee. I well remember one little &#8216;yard, fresh out of his loincloth, who, in less than year, learned to maintain and repair the camp&rsquo;s 60 KW diesel generator, plus our vehicles. I still shake my head at that one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that Euro-Americans and Asians are culturally quite different, though in some ways I wish we were a bit more like the Asians, who venerate the family, their elders, value self-control, and have the ability to focus on long-term objectives and the self-discipline to achieve them.  I think we&rsquo;re rather more inventive, independent, and certainly irreverant.</p>
<p>I think the white European and particularly the East Asian races are in fact rather complementary. Neither of us commits crimes against the other, neither of us ruins neighborhoods, neither of us expects to live off the labor of others, and neither of us has any strong desire to dominate our fellow citizens.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s any group I&rsquo;d be happy to see more of in this country it would be Asians.</p>

Assimilating into a completely dysfunctional society that seems to be hunting the lowest common denominator in human behavior does not.  If our positions were reversed, and the far East had large white ethnic minorities while our Asian host societies were degenerating at breakneck speed under the impetus of Fourth-world immigrants and Marxist politicians and media hacks, we would be saying &#8220;Assimilate with this?

<p>Asians here in the USA have done quite well and often make more money than Whites do  so they are more than treated as equals here. Also, Canada has a lot more Asians than the USA too which makes integration much quicker just like Blacks are more integrated in the USA because there are more of them. However, a lot of people here are missing the point. Asians do have a lot of good qualities, there is no denying it. However, Asians are a different race and see themselves as such. Imagine if an Asian country started getting millions of Whites, they wouldn&rsquo;t like it one bit and wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. No matter how good Asians are, people are tribal beings, and having large numbers of a different race, no matter how good they are, weakens societal unity.</p>

<p>The ancestors of the Mexicans had the Mayans and Aztecs, but one died out and the other was dominated and supplanted by the Spanish who were horrified at the human sacrifice thing.  The Incas were never more than an organized agrarian empire.</p>

		<p>Having grown up in California, and having Asian friends of all Asian ethnicities, I must say that I really admire and like Japanese and Koreans, and many Chinese.  However, I still do not want my community to be overrun by them.  What is wrong with with wanting to preserve the European make-up of my nation?  Why would I want my nation to become predominately Asian or any other race?  The Japanese, the Koreans, the Chinese, and on and on   &mdash;   they each have a country of their own.  Why do they need to displace me from my own country?  By the way, my 3.82 GPA daughter did not get into UC Berkeley, however, 2,000 Asians did this year.  My family cannot attend the university that my kin built, because the children of recent foreign immigrants have dispalced us.  China has universities, also.  Why do Chinese need to come to the USA and take my daughters&rsquo;s place at university?</p>

<p>In response to Asian dude, I&rsquo;d agree that some lower class whites do pick on Asians, which is one reason you don&rsquo;t see many Asian school teachers. A lot of people are cowards and will pick on those they percieve to be less tough than themselves and grovel towards those they perceive to be tougher. Since whites tend to be bigger than Asians, Asians will at times get picked on by whites who are too scared to tackle blacks or polynesians.</p>

		<p>This is a very interesting and important article. I think we need to distinguish something, though. I believe that, as some of the Asian commenters on the thread are saying, it is not necessarily the rank-and-file Asian person who buys this pan-Asian sort of &#8220;victim&#8221;/identity politics. Rather, it is the Jesse Jacksons and the other race-hustling elites who are really pushing it, because they stand to benefit the most. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s also an element of &#8220;divide and conquer&#8221; going on here, in a more general sense.</p>
<p>That being said, the article does establish, in a convincing manner, that there is some movement towards identity politics amongst rank-and-file Asian-Americans. It&rsquo;s especially interesting (and concerning) how such bloc voting groups are extorting promises of racial spoils out of, who else, but the Democratic party: the party of anyone who is not white (or a man).</p>
<p>Ultimately, I believe this pan-Asian thing will not prove to be nearly as much of a threat as what we see from Hispanic and black groups, partly because Asians are simply better able to compete, and partially because there is a lot of &#8220;diversity&#8221; within the &#8220;Asian&#8221; people (Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, etc.). However, we must not lose sight of that fact that it *is* indeed a threat to white Americans. This article shows, at the end of the day, that we need to keep our countries majority white, and that includes keeping most Asians out. Like every other racial group, they are most loyal to themselves and their own perceived interests - and these are not guaranteed to be the same as white interests by any stretch, no matter how intelligent and law-abiding most Asians may be.</p>

		<p>Some very interesting commentary here, but I still have this nagging question about Asians (Chinese in particular) that I had asked sometime back on another article related to Asians. Nobody ever gave a plausible and satisfactory response, so I&rsquo;ll try again, seeing that we seem to have a fairly engaged group of informed commentators here. </p>
<p>Much has been said and continues to be said lauding Asian virtues of intelligence, general modesty, social cohesiveness, civilized behavior and clean living, and sexual modesty/circumspection (as opposed to say, the Blacks&rsquo; proclivities to sexual excesses and debauchery). </p>
<p>And it is that last point that presents an issue of cognitive dissonance that nobody seems to be able to effectively address. </p>
<p>So why is it that China has a over population problem if it is populated by a culture that values sexual modesty and circumspection?</p>

		<p>Dear Post # 30:</p>
<p>Your White daughter was not accepted into Berkeley.  She will have to go to a less prestigious school, will obtain a less prestigious job, will have to live in a less wealthy community in a smaller house.  When her children try to go to college (assuming that she can afford children, with the high tax-burden), they will have to compete not with the future 50% Asian enrollment at the UC system, but with the projected 75% Asian enrollment.  <br>
     You have been displaced by a foreign group.  You have been colonized by Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc.  To make matters worse, to speed the displacement of you and your family, your government has taken money from your family and given it to the very same people who now displace you, in your own country (via resettlement &amp; social welfare programs, free education, etc.).  It is not just the Asians, but at this very moment, part of your salary is (via taxes) being spent to bring hundreds of thousands of Kurds, Somali, Haitians, Ethiopians, Samoans, etc, etc. who also will serve to displace you.  </p>
<p>Europeans built the most amazing country the world has ever seen, and then they just gave it away.  The odd thing is, while they were destroying the future of thier own children, they were giddy with pride about how non-racist they were.   <br>

<p>Anonymous is on to something: this is likely partly the result of the schools training Asians to be more ethnic oriented. I went to a school with a high concentration of Asians and males (take a guess at what type of school) and can recall Asians getting excited (angry) about a lecture on white&rsquo;s being racist and other events at the school. They can be very nationalistic, which is good.</p>
<p>In February I was on a  NYC subway heading home. An Asian man and his (middle?) school age daughter came on the train at one of the stops. The daughter was relating her experience at school that day. She was very upset. She had learned about the KKK and their horribleness. The teacher must have made her feel that KKK members in full regalia may assault her at any moment in Manhattan. The father was trying to explain what had happened.</p>
<p>This makes one wonder with the radical takeover of the university and at the same time the Asian takeover of the better schools, I am sure there are some absurd situations taking place in higher education. The Berkeley Hippy Dippy educated professor who now has his chance to live out his dream telling it like it is revealing the depravities of white bread culture and the horrors of American society-to a class full of Asians, mostly the children of people who recently arrived. </p>
<p>Steve Sailer wrote an article in Vdare fairly recently where he stated (and I would have to agree) that Asians basically want to conform. The fact that they settle in mostly liberal urban settings means that they adhere to the politics of the typically self loathing Metro Democrat. </p>

		<p>This is a deep, dark secret many Intelligent Chinese people talk about only amongst themselves in private, as it is too embarassing to speak of openly to others who are not Chinese: </p>
<p>Many Intelligent Chinese people are fearful of a country run by only Chinese. Given a choice, Chinese people would rather live in a country run by Intelligent Whites, like the United States, England, Australia, Canada, etc. </p>
<p>Intelligent Chinese recognize that, for whatever reason, Intelligent Whites in America, for example, tend to run a superior country compared to those that are purely Chinese run. </p>
<p>Intelligent Chinese in America live a better, happier life than they would in China.</p>
<p>The reasons for this phenomenon are numerous and debatable. The actuality of the preference, is not, as evidenced by the mass immigration of Chinese to White-run countries. </p>
<p>This is shameful for us Intelligent Chinese people to admit because its implications for the Chinese are many, and few of them flattering. </p>
<p>When all is said and done, Intelligent Chinese, given a choice, want to live in a country like America, a White-run country. </p>
<p>Intelligent Chinese see the absolute importance of America being and staying majority White. We wonder why it is that more Whites don&rsquo;t see things this way. We wonder why more Whites aren&rsquo;t doing more to help the White people. </p>
<p>We wonder why Whites are allowing themselves to be drowned by a flood of Hispanics and Blacks. </p>
<p>We even go so far as to wonder why Whites have already let in so many of us Chinese to begin with. </p>
<p>But, unlike the Hispanics and Blacks, we Intelligent Chinese in America are very grateful to be here. We study hard, work hard, honor the laws, and live peaceably. </p>
<p>Those that don&rsquo;t are our fringe elements and are despised by us Intelligent Chinese as a whole. We wish we could make the Bad Chinese disappear, as they embarrass us. </p>
<p>We understand the desire of Whites not wanting to be &#8220;race replaced&#8221; by anyone. And if American Whites were to close off all immigration tomorrow, Intelligent Chinese would find it understandable, as we would have shut off immigration a long long time ago. </p>
<p>What remains is, as a group, we Intelligent Chinese are a grateful people. Grateful to our White hosts. </p>
<p>Our preference is also for a majority White country run by Intelligent Whites. </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>So why is it that China has a over population problem if it is populated by a culture that values sexual modesty and circumspection?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a good question and on the surface it seems incongruent to mensurable traits as lauded by different White authors who have explored the subject. </p>
<p>The answer, when you dig deep, lies with the agricultural history of China. For thousands of years, most Chinese were peasant farmers. The rigors of farm life required them to have large families to help with the multitudes of hard labor associated with an agrarian society. </p>
<p>This became the cultural norm. Once married, Chinese couples were expected to have large families. It was common for Chinese farmers to have upwards of 5-12 children. </p>
<p>Even today, an estimated 300 million Chinese in China are still farmers (or are working in agriculture-related industries). </p>
<p>The overpopulation is a result of too many children WITHIN marriages. This has very little resemblance to the rampant single-motherhood that&rsquo;s found in black communities across across America. The vast majority of Chinese children in China are born to married couples. (Think Mormons and their rampant reproductive rates within marriages.) </p>
<p>The Chinese overpopulated China because married farm couples were having too many children. </p>
<p>But today, precisely the opposite is happening. </p>
<p>Because of the hyper-industrialization of China and the shift from farming to industrial cities, many young Chinese couples are either having just one child (and often they wait till in their mid to late thirties to do so) or deciding to simply not have any children. </p>
<p>Today, young Chinese couples see little need to have children, so many simply don&rsquo;t. The demands of farm life have disappeared. Suddenly today, young Chinese couples understand that having children is more of a burden than a boon. </p>
<p>This trend is happening across Japan as well as China. East Asian reproduction due to mass industrialization has essentially dropped off a cliff in terms of numbers. </p>
<p>The trend for young Chinese today is to have few or no children. </p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

		<p>Flaxen-Headed Strumpet, having a large population doesn&rsquo;t mean that a nation lacks sexual modesty or circumspection.  White reproductive rates are below replacement levels, but nobody claims that&rsquo;s because Whites are so chaste.  Married couples who rear their children together are the core of any civilization, and I&rsquo;ve never heard that packs of fatherless, feral boys are roaming the villages of China.  </p>

		<p>#37 is accurate in that the U.S. and other Western nations are collapsing. In 1900, the West dominated the world, now it is being colonized. Not only do the West&rsquo;s leaders not resist, they aid the invaders. <br>
Of course, these &#8220;New Americans&#8221; have a negative view of Western men. The only men they respect are the men who oppose them. The men who don&rsquo;t, are considered useful idiots. I don&rsquo;t think that the &#8220;New Americans&#8221; will be setting up reservations for the displaced natives. </p>
<p>What will happen to White women? If history is any guide they will probably do all right. Men fight; women bare the winners&rsquo; children. All men consider White women very desirable sex objects. The gals will have to put their Feminism on hold for a while, but I&rsquo;m sure that they con manage that.<br>

<p>&gt; Actually in my community, many - even long time Middle Eastern (Persian) immigrants are noticing that at least the recent Asian immigrants tend to be rude and pushy.  Other online discussions I have sampled seem to conclude that Asians (Chinese) today actually feel they are superior to whites.  This is due to the big ego boost the Chinese economy has allowed, as well as other ongoing Western assumptions - such as the superiorty of Chinese Medicine, Martial Arts, Bhudism, etc., that actually condone and pave the way for more socially agressive stereotypes.  My own experience is limited to only a few incidents.  My neighborhood dry cleaner was taken over by a Chinese woman.  When I brought some business to her, I found her rude and arrogant towards me.  I will not bring my business to her shop again.  On the other hand, not far from her is an excellent Chinese restaurant whose owner I met when I was to give a health care science presentation for a local association.  He was courteous, friendly, and engaging.  But he was more &#8220;old school.&#8221;  I had an Filipino friend some years ago.  I recall how startled I was when I uncovered how deeply he resented white Americans and white America.</p>
<p>I think the basics hold, no matter what group you are dealing with.  It is possible to have civilizing relationships with civilized people, but submitting oneself to racial demonizing for the sake of some fuzzy, feel good notions of a socialist utopia is not only an illusion, but it will only destroy your own people in the end.</p>
<p>As for the dating, do Chinese parents require the submission of an IQ test?  LOL<br>

		<p>Asian&rsquo;s and whites are natural allies.  Taxes, crime, affirmative action all hit our &#8220;communities&#8221; disproportinately.  The difference is that Asian&rsquo;s rarely speak out on these issues preferring to let whites do it.  I live in a white neighborhood which is starting to see asians moving in to escape the larger more urbanized areas (black, hispanic).  It is the same thing as white flight, except they are above criticism due to their race.  If judged by the same standard as whites, it is double racist.  First they don&rsquo;t like poor violent uneducated blacks anymore than whites, but secondly, they knowingly use whites as a shield to asorb the political backlash.   </p>

the other side&#8221;.  Recall the Analects, (I would expect that Confucius, as we<br>
know him in the West, is still well-known among Chinese, or is a prophet truly<br>
without honor in his hometown?) particularly the sections about good and ill<br>
government and how the honorable man is as keen on avoiding office under latter<br>
as holding office under the former.  When I read that, I saw it as Western<br>
history in a nutshell.  The grass is not greener  &mdash;  my ancestors have had the<br>
same problems in Europe as your ancestors have had in China.</p>
<p>@Whiteplight (#45)</p>
<p>The Chinese are now feeling superior because of Buddhism?  Amusing, since<br>
Buddhism originated in India (and could well have been the true root of the<br>
Christian New Testament  &mdash;  many of Jesus&rsquo; teachings have paralells in Buddhism<br>
and Buddhist missionaries are known to have been active in the area).</p>
<p>@Francois (#49)</p>
<p>Not to belittle your point, but given observed behavior, I think the Asians are<br>
more interested in our men than our women.  (How many Asian male/White female<br>
couples do you see?  How many White male/Asian female couples do you see?)</p>
<p>(A not-so-kind side note for Trekkies out there:  the Asians seem to be taking<br>
the Orion approach.)</p>
<p>  &mdash;  an unrelated comment:</p>
<p>Since the long-term consequence of proximity is probably inevitable mixing,<br>
we&rsquo;re kinda in a bit of a fix  &mdash;  either we kick all the Asians back to Asia<br>
(&#8220;What do you mean they won&rsquo;t fit?&#8221;), sterilize Africa and send the Asians to<br>
recolonize it (&#8220;What do you mean it would still be radioactive centuries<br>
later?&#8221;), or accept having distant decendants that don&rsquo;t look all that much<br>
like us (&#8220;Yes, I know that&rsquo;s exactly what we don&rsquo;t want.&#8221;).  Since the &#8220;do<br>
nothing&#8221; course of action implies the last of those alternatives, I suppose the<br>
bright side is that a homogeneous and unique society *should* work better than<br>
the ongoing disaster we have now.  Still, I&rsquo;d kinda my decendants to resemble<br>
me.</p>

		<p>The reasons Asians are so clannish is that they support each other. African Americans do not do this. In fact, they are suspicious of each other. For example, many Korean businesses get started because of a system where several people put money into a pot and they all take turns getting money from that pot to start businesses. The reason for this is because they get rejected by banks for a business loan and they also start the business being debt free and do not have to worry about having to pay debts as other small business owners have to.</p>

         There simply ARE NOT &#8216;1.1 to 1.2 billion people in the world who Amrenners would accept as White&rsquo;. It is simply untrue under any scientific enumeration - you must have deliberately added in the dubious millions of &#8216;Latin&rsquo; Americans (most of whom are mestizo hybrids) to deliberately confuse and inflate the figure.<br>
There are substantially less than 1 billion Whites (by this I mean those of pure European stock), alie in the world today, and their numbers are rapidly decreasing.<br>
 Furthermore, i do not accept and will never accept the asiatic caucasoidal ethicities you describe (Indians, Arabs etc) as being &#8216;White&rsquo; as I understand it.</p>

		<p>53 Anon: The Orientals have been forming loan pools for centuries, as have many other civilized peoples.  It&rsquo;s not a consequence of being refused loans by banks.  </p>

<p>-&gt; John Liu seems to be right:</p>
<p>Europe: 700 mil<br>
USA: ~200 mil non-hispanic white<br>
South America: ~200 mil non-mixed white<br>
South Africa: 4,5 mil<br>
Australia: 20 mil<br>
New Zealand: 2,3 mil</p>
<p>If you include Turks, non-mixed North Africans, Arabs, Iranians and Caucasian people, the number would be make up apprx. 23,5-24% of the world population.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Chinese IQ maybe 105&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazing grammar aside, the &#8220;Chinese IQ&#8221; varies by province. 105 is at the lowest end for the poorest Southern provinces.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the Asians are<br>
more interested in our men than our women.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way of putting it. Rather, they are eager to be rid of their worst (least attractive, least intelligent) women, and men.</p>

<p>The 1.5 billion &#8220;East Asians&#8221; in China, Japan, Korea and Mongolia have the ATDNA &#8220;diversity&#8221; of all Caucasoids combined, incl. Europeans, Middle Easterners, Northern Indians, etc.</p>
<p>If you wanted to go just by one subset of East Asians the component ethnic groups would not exceed 1 billion in number.</p>

		<p>True loan pools have been around for centuries. However, the chances of a newly arrived Asian immigrant getting a bank loan for a small store or laundry is going to be slim to none. The purpose of the business is to employ family members who would have a difficult time finding work because they are not fluent in English. In many areas of the country, they have taken over the nail care business because it requires about three to four months to learn and get licensed and they are able to work for themselves. It is also primarily a cash business, such as with barbers and hair stylists. They have brought the price down for nair care services and made it affordable for the average woman to go and get her nails done.</p>

<p>Thank you, Anonymous, but you see, that may be true now&hellip; But what will it be like, in say, 25 years? With more and more Asians on American soil, and White men having been displaced, pushed to the side, for 25 years, I suppose we will see more and more Asian male/White female couples.</p>
<p>That, among many things, is why I say that Asians are a threat.</p>
