<h1><a href="https://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/04/mcdonnell_issues_thorough_apol.html">McDonnell Issues Thorough Apology for Leaving Slavery out of Proclamation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Dean Hopkins, Washington Post, April 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) apologized late Wednesday for failing to include slavery in his proclamation declaring April as Confederate History Month. The full text of his statement follows:<blockquote>Governor Bob McDonnell issued the following statement today regarding the proclamation of Confederate History Month in the Commonwealth</p>
<p>&#8220;The proclamation issued by this Office designating April as Confederate History Month contained a major omission. The failure to include any reference to slavery was a mistake, and for that I apologize to any fellow Virginian who has been offended or disappointed. The abomination of slavery divided our nation, deprived people of their God-given inalienable rights, and led to the Civil War. Slavery was an evil, vicious and inhumane practice which degraded human beings to property, and it has left a stain on the soul of this state and nation. In 2007, the Virginia General Assembly approved a formal statement of &#8220;profound regret&#8221; for the Commonwealth&rsquo;s history of slavery, which was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>When I signed the Proclamation designating February as Black History Month, and as I look out my window at the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial, I am reminded that, even 150 years later, Virginia&rsquo;s past is inextricably part of our present. The Confederate History Month proclamation issued was solely intended to promote the study of our history, encourage tourism in our state in advance of the 150th Anniversary of the beginning of the Civil War, and recognize Virginia&rsquo;s unique role in the story of America. The Virginia General Assembly unanimously approved the establishment of a Sesquicentennial American Civil War Commission to prepare for and commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the War, in order to promote history and create recognition programs and activities.</p>
<p>As Virginians we carry with us both the burdens and the blessings of our history. Virginia history undeniably includes the fact that we were the Capitol of the Confederacy, the site of more battlefields than any other state, and the home of the signing of the peace agreement at Appomattox.</p>
<p>Our history is perhaps best encapsulated in a fact I noted in my Inaugural Address in January: The state that served as the Capitol of the Confederacy was also the first in the nation to elect an African-American governor, my friend, L. Douglas Wilder. America&rsquo;s history has been written in Virginia.</p>
<p>We cannot avoid our past; instead we must demand that it be discussed with civility and responsibility. During the commemoration of the Civil War over the next four years, I intend to lead an effort to promote greater understanding and harmony in our state among our citizens.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>In addition the Governor announced that the following language will be added to the Proclamation:<blockquote>WHEREAS, it is important for all Virginians to understand that the institution of slavery led to this war and was an evil and inhumane practice that deprived people of their God-given inalienable rights and all Virginians are thankful for its permanent eradication from our borders, and the study of this time period should reflect upon and learn from this painful part of our history .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
</blockquote></p>

		<p>Fine.  Does this mean we can make black crime a major tenet of black history month next February?  I&rsquo;m sure the state spends far more money on BHM every Feb. than on CHM every April, save the years when a Democrat is Governor and CHM is not recognized.</p>

		<p>I demand an apology from all the descendants of enslaved africans who have robbed, raped, and murdered White people.  Until Jesse J, Al S, John L, Joseph L, Ophra W, Michelle O apologize to me for the mayhem and destruction caused by the race to whom the most generous people on Earth gave freedom and entitlement, then afrovoodoo demands for apologies or anything else will be met only with an ever solidifying contempt.</p>
<p>White people who apologize to afros are race traitors.   </p>

		<p> I guess a man&rsquo;s gotta do what he&rsquo;s gotta do   &mdash;   much as he would rather have triple root canal than do it. But I wonder if the craven crawling and apologizing that White males do after saying or doing something that the Left can jump on as &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;insensitive&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t just make matters worse for politicians.</p>
<p> I wonder what would happen if, just once, a man who had trodden on overly-sensitive toes like Gov. McDonnell did, when confronted about it, replied: &#8220;Sorry it offends you, but I said what I meant and I meant what I said, and I WILL NOT apologize for a word of it. Life isn&rsquo;t fair, and you&rsquo;re not guaranteed a life free of being &#8216;offended.&rsquo; Get over it, and get used to it.&#8221; I&rsquo;ll bet the hills and valleys would ring with millions of Caucasians   &mdash;   and others   &mdash;   yelling, &#8220;Hooray! At last, in the sight of God and everyone, a REAL MAN again!&#8221;</p>
<p> And one last word: One of the news items about McDonnell&rsquo;s &#8220;apology&#8221; said he made it after apparently realizing that 20 percent of Virginia voters are black. Now, did that writer actually think that a Republican like McDonnell would get more than a handful of their votes anyway? What would he have had to lose by manning up and refusing to back down?</p>

		<p>The Governor&rsquo;s apology is pathetically over-stated, but the new language inserted into the Proclamation isn&rsquo;t particularly inappropriate, IMHO.</p>
<p>I can accept that the existence of slavery was the major catalyst of The War, and that the institution was immoral and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution (though the Old Testament DOES defend it, just as Southern slave-owners insisted; and the Constitution was written BY white men FOR white men).</p>
<p>Now, can Virginia&rsquo;s black advocacy groups concede that in Africa  &mdash;  long before there had been any exposure to European influences  &mdash;  the enslavement of Africans BY Africans and FOR Africans was the law of the land (i.e., the law of the jungle) and at least equally immoral and barbaric?</p>
<p>Put THAT in your Black History!   </p>

		<p><i>Slavery was an evil, vicious and inhumane practice which degraded human beings to property</i></p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s so important to remember slavery, let&rsquo;s not forget to mention that slavery was rampant throughout Africa, that it was African slave traders who sold the original slaves to the white man, and that slavery is still practiced throughout Africa today. What is more important to talk about: slavery that ended 150 years ago or slavery going on right now?</p>

		<p>They can wait until Hell freezes over before they get any apology from me. </p>
<p>As far as &#8220;Apologies&#8221; and &#8220;Reparations&#8221; are concerned, how do they account for all the dead Soldiers that fought over that non-issue? Do their sacrifices mean nothing? They paid in blood. But you can&rsquo;t spend that at the local Sporting Goods Store on a pair of High Tops, or on cases of Malt Liquor.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard one word from any Black regarding the Rape, Torture, and Murders of Channon Christian, and Christopher Newsome, or of 14 year old, Christopher Jones, murdered on his block, in a Suburb of Baltimore, Mayland, last June, 2009. </p>
<p>These are three of countless cases that happen every day, since the grand Civil Rights bill was passed. All that did was open the way for Black crime to explode to its fullest potential.  </p>
<p>If any Legislation needs to be reversed, it&rsquo;s that. </p>

		<p>There is not a human being alive today that has any legitimate reason for being &#8216;offended&rsquo; by actions taken by people here nearly 250 years ago. First, they have no concept of what actually took place then, even though they claim to be; so much so that they actually insist on altering history. Second, I&rsquo;m sure you could count on two hands the number of blacks today who can actually trace their family tree back to the 1860&rsquo;s, and have an awareness of that relative&rsquo;s lot in life. Regardless of what slavery was or wasn&rsquo;t I, nor anyone alive today had one ounce of responsibility for it; therefore, I will shoulder no guilt. I do, however, feel absolute and total disgust and anger for those whites who shrivel like dried leaf when taking a stand may cost them a penny. </p>

		<p>As a human being, I&rsquo;m offended that the black afro tribal chiefs sold their own black afro neighbors (cousins, all) to a foreign race.  I demand that sub sahara africa apologize to the human family for selling sub saharan africans away from their home continent.  I demand they follow the apology with an atonement by bringing all their diasporatized bruthas and sistas back home to africa.  We here in White America will lose our lovely Diversity, but africa will gain back its kinsmen.   </p>

		<p>What about those of us who are &#8220;offended and disappointed&rsquo; in the &#8220;apology&#8221;? Do WE get an apology? AS anyone who knows ANYTHING about the war of northern aggression knows, slavery had not a whit to do with it. lincoln himself stated he would leave every slave where it was if he could keep the union from dissolving. lincoln cared SO much about the african that blacks were prohibited from even entering his home state. And if &#8216;emancipation&rsquo; was so important, why was the &#8216;emancipation proclamation&rsquo; not authored until nearly 2 and a half years in when the north was losing. AND left slavery alone in northern states? That was just a political ploy to incite emotions and draw attention away from the draft riots and the ENSLAVEMENT of [mostly] Irish immigrants. the hypocrisy is nauseating&hellip;</p>

		<p>The race hustle, the race baiting, and the race industry will NOT cease or retreat until WHITES get manly enough to say &#8220;shove it&#8221; and STOP backing off when they do something like honor their OWN history, culture, or causes and get criticized.  I am sick and tired of cheering when I see something like the original proclamation, and then have to eat crow because some cowardly Governor backs down at the first grumble coming from blacks.  Does he seriously think BLACKS put him in power, or will vote for him in gratitude for his backing down?  NO.  They just hold ALL we whites in further contempt, and their demands grow more insistent and more pernicious.  Screw them.  It is time we whites tell them to celebrate their OWN culture if they want, and to just SHUT UP about OURS.  And then ignore them.  Such as, letting the original proclamation stand, and publicly tell any who are offended they have the right to NOT celebrate it, but they do have the invitation to SHUT UP.</p>

		<p>    Slavery was the catalyst only in a political sense, slave states vs free states as new territories to the west were opened up . The facts remain . Less than 8% of the Atlantic slave trade came to what is now the United States . In other words had that 8% not been brought here, they were still slaves . Had they never left Africa, they were still slaves . There was a labor void in the pre-industrial New World, that&rsquo;s why they were brought here . Nations and empires are not built without labor . Not only are their progeny better off for the sacrifice their ancestors were forced into, as they would now be living in a hell hole like Rwanda, Darfur or Somalia . But the first generation here was literally ushered into a better life of housing, farming, stability, functioning governments and economies far superior to anything they could have expected as bushmen and tribesmen in Africa . Before the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln reiterated over and over that the war was not about slavery, congress even made a declaration as such, &#8221; This war is not fought in the spirit of conquest, or to interfere with the INSTITUTIONS of the states etcetera . &#8221; You get the gist .As for their bondage, what is freedom in a pre-industrial,agricultural America that was largely an unspoiled continental wilderness? Is a prehistoric existence and endless tribal warfare in sub Saharan Africa freedom ? It&rsquo;s past time to stop apologizing .                                                                                                                                                </p>

		<p>This is ridiculous. The American people have been completely brain-washed into feeling guilt about this period in their history. How many blacks in the USA today are proper descendants and how many jump on the bandwagon? They should be kissing the feet of their enslavers for not leaving them to rot in Africa. As I understand it, the South were in the process of getting rid of slavery when the North declared war so why all the outrage? In any case, that&rsquo;s beside the point. I&rsquo;m sure America is regretting not picking their own cotton today!</p>

		<p>All blacks in America who lived in servitude have been dead for nearly a century.  Every white American who ever owned or bought slaves has been dead for an equally long period. No American black currently living was ever a slave.  All are and have been citizens since birth, with all the advantages conferred by American citizenship and birthright. </p>
<p>Their black brethren in Africa still live in primitive and cruel circumstances, with less than helf the life-expectancy of their American cousins, who enjoy the highest standard of living among any black Africans in the world.  They in fact enjoy a higher standard of living than all but the populations of a few European and East Asian nations.  </p>
<p>Like all black African expatriates everywhere they&rsquo;re found, American blacks are still at the bottom of the social and economic order, the consequence of a huge and implacable intelligence deficit when compared to people of any other race.  And like all black African expatriates everywhere, they impose huge costs on any nation they inhabit.</p>
<p>Some would argue that they owe the rest of us an apology for the burdens they impose on us.  I disagree.  It&rsquo;s not their doing that they&rsquo;re here (nor ours), nor is their genetic code their fault.</p>
<p>The madness that grips our society is the specious notion that every race and ethnic group be equally represented in all occupations and strata of our nation, and that failure to achieve this highly questionable &#8220;ideal&#8221; is prima facie evidence of baseless discrimination.</p>
<p>Blacks, of course, seize on this convenient excuse for failure (who wouldn&rsquo;t?) and thus fail to live up to even modest expectations. Blacks are fully capable of being skilled tradesmen, line workers, manual laborers, and even professionals in exceptional cases.  There should be no barriers to whatever they can achieve.  Likewise, there should be no formulaic demands made on the rest of us to ensure proportional representation.  This only ensures a perpetual attitude of grievance and entitlement on the part of blacks and the growing exasperation and anger of all other groups not so favored.</p>
<p>The so-called Civil Rights Act was perhaps the single most pernicious and destructive legislative act ever conceived in this nation.  It immediately stopped and reversed what real progress was being made naturally among American blacks, which began after WW II and gained momentum in the Fifties and Sixties. What was hailed as a landmark (and still is) by white liberals was in fact a permanent roadblock to genuine progress for blacks and real accommodation between the races.</p>

		<p>Except it WASN&rsquo;T slavery that even remotely caused the war.  The &#8220;peculiar institution&#8221; was a side issue, although it was of great importance to Northern abolitionists, who were in the vast minority.  The thing is, no white person, Northern or Southern, at that time had any intention of granting full citizenship rights, equal to those of whites, to slaves/blacks.  It was the general attitude of the time that blacks were in fact inferior to whites.  It was a universal belief.  And a distinguished history professor of mine, at the very beginning of the PC revolution in the late 1960&rsquo;s, said, &#8220;It is the height of stupidity and ignorance to judge the past by the standards of the present.&#8221;  That being true, it is high time we STOP apologizing to blacks and everyone else for the standards that existed long before we were born.  GET OVER IT, PEOPLE!!  We of today owe no one anything for what was in the past, period, end of report.</p>

<p>That turned out to be the most expensive cotton in the world! It&rsquo;s cost to us   &mdash;   to this very day   &mdash;   has been immense and incalculable.</p>
<p>Just as today&rsquo;s hotel maids, nurses, and lettuce pickers will be in the next century. Those hotel beds, strawberries,  bedpans, and lettuce heads will prove to be the most expensive labor ever performed in the history of the world.  Their real cost will be paid for with a country, handed over intact.</p>

		<p>If slavery was so bad and evil then why do we allow third worlders to be brought to the US to be used as slaves and enslaved in their own countries at the behest of US interests both corporate and governmental?</p>
<p>To put this issue in perspective, there are more actual slaves (people who are whipped, if they don&rsquo;t work, kept in cages when they are not working, and they and their families murdered if they defy their owners) within the borders of the US, right now, then when slavery was actually legal.  There are many times that number being trafficked for sex (many of them children).  And many times THAT number kept in bondage in a more casual sense&hellip;.not paid a living wage, the balance made up for in illegal welfare they are given.</p>
<p>Slavery is very bad for a society.  Moreso today than it ever was in the past.  Today, though, the slave is invisible.  And just as often the victimizer as they are the victim.  And those that would take up their cause, spend the lions share of their time and effort promoting the very things that lead to that slavery&hellip;.and won&rsquo;t even admit what is going on in our very own country&hellip;.let alone what happens in other countries on our behalf.</p>

		<p>During the American Revolution,Lord Dunmore,the Royal Governor of Virginia appointed by the King,sought to win VIRGINIA back for the British Crown with Black troops recruited in America,to be called the Ethiopian Regiment.Parties of blacks in the south were armed by the British with guns,clubs,and swords with the order to use them against rebellious American patriots.(Ronald Hoffman, &#8220;The Dissaffected in the Revolutionary South,&#8221; The American Revolution: Explorations in the History of American Radicalism,pp281).&#8221;By the first of December(1775) nearly 300 blacks in uniform,with the words &#8216;Liberty to Slaves&rsquo; inscribed across their breasts,were members of Lord Dunmores Ethiopian Regiment..On the  ninth of December at the Battle of the Great  Bridge  &mdash;  the Lexington of the South  &mdash;  the British force of 600,nearly half black,was thrown back by Woodfords all White,American Second Virginia Regiment&hellip;</p>

		<p>23 Cassandra: You&rsquo;re right about the problems the cheap Brown labor of today will bring in the future.  We need to send them all home, the deserving among them with a sack of money taken from their cheap employers, to avoid being destroyed in the next hundred years.  </p>

<p>Hey, I LIKE that idea!  Very much.  Let those who profited pay the price.  Very good!</p>
<p>Yes, there may be no such thing as &#8220;cheap employees&#8221;, but there is definitely such a thing as &#8220;cheap employers&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
It would be most interesting if some economist could total up the overall cost of &#8220;cheap labor&#8221; to society in general&hellip; including the expense of medical care, police services, courts, sanitation, fire department, special education needs, etc., etc .  (I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this has already been done.)  </p>
<p>Then, the employers should be hit with the bill for this massive   drain on society, instead of letting them get away with collecting all the profits while passing on the bill for all the problems to the government/taxpayers   &mdash;  - and that is EXACTLY what they&rsquo;ve been doing thus far.   What a racket!  Nothing short of a crime.</p>
<p>And whatever politicians have been complicit in helping them to get away with this should be held as equally criminal.</p>

		<p>To razor (post #25):</p>
<p>Thanks for the fascinating history lesson.  I had to look into it for myself and confirmed the event of 1775 (truly the Lexington or Bunker Hill of the South, before the Declaration of &#8216;76 was issued).  </p>
<p>I found Great Bridge (Norfolk area) in Boatner&rsquo;s Encyclopedia of the American Revolution.  Besides Col. Wm. Woodford, Boatner lists Virginia patriots Lt. John Marshall (future esteemed Chief Justice) and Col. Edward Stevens as having participated as well as some North Carolina militia and miscellaneous backwoods &#8220;shirt men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Dunmore had preceded &#8220;Honest Abe&#8221; Lincoln in enlisting the aid of African-Americans to kill Americans of European descent.  May the bloody consequences be upon both their hands.       </p>

		<p>To Razor (post #29):</p>
<p>10-4 good buddy.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip; I&rsquo;ll definitely look into Hoffman&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware that documentation exists describing the horrors suffered by white indentured servants, including the fact that they were packed like sardines and confined for the voyage in the holds of the ships that transported them here.  </p>
<p>This story is tragically, inexcusably, almost totally ignored while our attention is diverted to the &#8220;diaspora&#8221; of transplanted Africans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good that this website provides us with a forum to share knowledge; the truth will set us free!     </p>
