<h1>Frat Inspired by Robert&nbsp;E. Lee Bans Rebel Uniforms</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Reeves, Yahoo! News, April 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Virginia-based Kappa Alpha Order issued new rules to chapters earlier this year saying members aren&rsquo;t allowed to wear Rebel uniforms to parties or during their parades, which are a staple on campuses across the South.</p>
<p>The decision, announced in an internal memo posted on the group&rsquo;s website, followed a flap last year at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, where a black sorority complained after a KA parade stopped in front of its house on campus. KA members were dressed in the gray uniforms of Confederate officers, and young women wore hoop skirts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the memo to chapters, Kappa Alpha&rsquo;s national executive director, Larry Wiese, said such displays had to end.</p>
<p>&#8220;In today&rsquo;s climate, the Order can ill afford to offend our host institutions and fend off significant negative national press and remain effective at our core mission, which is to aid young men in becoming better community leaders and citizens,&#8221; Wiese wrote.</p>
<p>The KA chapter at Alabama has canceled this year&rsquo;s Old South parade, which was set for this week. Still, a large Confederate national flag covers the front of its house on campus.</p>
<p>Other KA chapters quit donning Confederate uniforms or holding parades with Old South themes in recent years as criticism grew. The University of Georgia chapter canceled its parade in 2006 after complaints by residents of a black neighborhood. Instead, it switched to a Founder&rsquo;s Day parade, with members riding horses but ditching Confederate gear.</p>
<p>Auburn University&rsquo;s chapter ended its Old South parade in 1992 after black students confronted white students with Confederate flags.</p>
<p>Kappa Alphas at Centenary College in Shreveport, La., moved their Old South events off campus in 2002 after drawing protests from the Black Student Alliance and others over the Confederate garb.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An alumna of the black sorority that complained about racial insensitivity at last year&rsquo;s parade said there are ways for the fraternity to acknowledge its Southern heritage beside dressing up like Confederate soldiers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kappa Alpha was founded in 1865 at Washington &amp; Lee University  &mdash;  a school partly named for the Confederate general, and the group calls Lee its &#8220;spiritual founder.&#8221; It has about 130 chapters nationwide.<br>

		<p>Well, frat-boy types aren&rsquo;t exactly known for principled stands.</p>
<p>Most just want to feel good, get along, and make money.</p>
<p>Being unintuitive types, they don&rsquo;t realize that feeling good means escapism, getting along is being PC, and making money is well-nigh impossible with Democrat rule in the Obamanation.</p>
<p>Actually, the lack of rigorous ethical and philosophical standards among this type of person has played a big part in the demise of our people. They have been epistemologically defenseless before the Obama/PC steamroller.</p>
<p>They will eventually stand for nothing except booze/drugs and one-night stands. </p>

		<p>Here is Kappa Alpha Order&rsquo;s definition of a gentleman:</p>
<p>&#8220;The gentleman does not needlessly and unnecessarily remind an offender of a wrong he may have committed against him. He cannot only forgive, he can forget; and he strives for that nobleness of self and mildness of character which impart sufficient strength to let the past be but the past. A true man of honor feels humbled when he cannot help humbling others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now they need to add:</p>
<p>&#8220;The gentlemen must tuck tail and run, never to defend his beliefs, values and heritage in the face of unwarranted attacks. &#8220;No&#8221; must never be a word found upon his lips.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Le Philosophe des Rues (Post #1) has made some excellent points. Not only is today&rsquo;s younger generation dumbed-down, they have lost all perspective, are left-wing loonies, and couldn&rsquo;t beat their way out of a wet paper bag.  And we&rsquo;re supposed to entrust the future of the USA to them?  We&rsquo;re doomed.  The Baby-Boomers are getting old, and many of them are just aged flower children who would never fight for anything meaningful.  Are we to conclude that there are no real men left?  I must add: so much for the &#8220;wearing of the Grey.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As the ghost of the esteemed, renowned, pioneering, iconic Eric Voegelin, I declare the KA fraternity boys as having disappointed the greatest hopes of  justified White Manhood. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve made the &#8220;adjustment&#8221; in favor of a foreign and alien race, their sworn enemies, and their ignominy shall follow them throughout their lives as an eternal shame of their line of our plighted White Race.  Their forthcoming Nobel Peace Prizes, Human Rights Awards, and SPLC-ADL Certificates of Courage shall never wipe away the spot of their guilt. </p>

<blockquote> More explicitly I would say: The Life of Reason, the ineluctable condition of personal and social order, has been destroyed. However, though these statements are true, one must distinguish between the climate of opinion and the nature of man. The climate of our universities certainly is hostile to the Life of Reason, but not every man is agreeable to have his nature deformed by the &ldquo;climate&rdquo; or, as it is sometimes called, the &ldquo;age.&rdquo; There are always young men with enough spiritual instinct to resist the efforts of &ldquo;educators&rdquo; who pressure for &ldquo;adjustment.&rdquo; </blockquote> </p>

		<p>Let us hope that such surrenders of white cultural heritage do not one day occasion regrets similar to that of the most famous decision to lay down arms   &mdash;  - made at Appomattox:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;If I had foreseen the use those people designed to make of their victory, there would have been no surrender at Appomattox Courthouse; no sir, not by me.  Had I foreseen the results of subjugation, I would have preferred to die at Appomattox with my brave men, my sword in my right hand.&rdquo;  Robert E.

<p><br>
Translation:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The only ways we will allow these White preppy boys to acknowledge their Southern heritages is for them to promise that they will never &#8216;celebrate&rsquo; their Southern heritage or ancestors, and will only acknowledge it by holding themselves accountable to us proud Black African American Women of Color  for their unearned White privilege, and come to us asking for permission before they ever think, speak, or act, unless their thoughts, speech, or actions are of the pre-approved sort that fosters Diversity by helping minorities through radical hospitality, passionately embracing cultural differences, and stepping down from their jobs to make room for  more deserving persons of color or gays. They all must read Newsweek from now on and strive to make the structural, systemic, and institutional atonements for the past sins of segregation.  They cannot eve begin the long, hard march of progress toward redemption until they &#8216;do more&rsquo; by swearing upon the Bone Altar of Dahomey a perpetual hatred of their wicked White Mothers for the Race Crime of having given birth to White Babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sorority that shut down Old South sure does have an unusual penchant for straightening their hair to look like White girls. Some of them show a cast of &#8220;color&#8221; that betrays their stolen White blood from the White Womb of our White Mothers. If we worshipped a Just God, the sorority that shut down KA&rsquo;s Confederate Memorial Party would have been fully African American with kinky wool on their heads and genuinely African skin to go with it, not these White girl wannabe sorority sistas.  Disgrace, all the way around, for everybody- the KA&rsquo;s, the afrovoodoos, and these yellow mulattos and their White grandmothers.</p>
<p>https://www.bama.ua.edu/~ua-aka/members.html</p>
<p>And they even stole our White names from our beautiful White daughters. What true African names their daughter any of these? Jennifer, Allison, Rachel, Britney, Carla, Ashley, Caroline.</p>
<p>You would think they were the daughters of English Lords and Ladies with names like that.  </p>
<p>Why do blacks insist on acting White while demanding that Whites apologize for being White?</p>
<p>Because they can get away with it!  For how much longer? Lest we forget&hellip;</p>

		<p>Next step:  Close down any KA fraternity house that does not immediately recruit, admit, initiate as many blacks as possible. Give all the blacks a dues waiver. Subsidize their entire fraternity dues bill with a Diversity Tax on the on White KAs, and Whites only. Push them along in the path to fraternity leadership based upon their &#8220;promise&#8221; and &#8220;vibrant cultural vitality, which we value and passionately embrace&#8221;. Find the names of Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s slaves,  and have African craftsmen carve Vodu totems from them. Set these upon a voodoo altar in the Chapter Room and force the White KA&rsquo;s to pray to the Diversity Idols.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Kunta Almighty Kente, we beg you to please show us your servants how to hate ourselves unto your everlasting glory, may our blood be damned and our birthrights dispossessed. We ring the bell and cast the spell. Bring unto our White sisters and White girlfriends the midnight redemption song of Mandingo&rsquo;s Jungle Passion. Grace these our petitions unto Zulu Dambolow Wedo Chango. May we never again offend your holy highness with our evil eyes that see Right in White. Blessed be the Black. Black Power! Tolerance!&#8221; </p>

		<p>If you did not know, one would be surprised at the PC exerted on young men in fraternal organizations on a typical college campus.  Although there is a pass for the black fraternities, no such understanding is allowed for whites.  Not all frats are of the &#8220;Animal House&#8221; variety.  My fraternity at a large Southern University was a studious group and retired the academic trophy, including the GPAs of Scholarship Houses.  However, when the writing was on the wall for all whites to attend PC training, to force any and all minority membership that included homosexuals, we closed down the chapter.  Besides having high grades, our chapter did an extraordinary amount of charity work that no other group has since replaced.  I refuse to give one cent to that school for what they did to us.</p>

		<p>I was a GDI in my college days (72-76) and found most Greeks to be a  shallow, loutish, and materialistic social climbing lot. I&rsquo;m sure that the Greek system has benefited many as a business network post college in spite of all of that. In any case my university had a KA chapter and I found them to be a comparatively boorish lot in the grand Greek scheme of things. But all that said, a bunch of PC &#8220;post racial&#8221; race baiting ninnies certainly have no right to suppress them. It is a shame to note that if KA ever had a backbone, it is a now a jellyfish without stingers.</p>

		<p>How many of these schools are public?  Which are private?  I know Washington and Lee is private.  Shouldn&rsquo;t private institutions be given more freedom to pursue their own school traditions?  To argue otherwise is setting a poor legal precedent. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a huge divide, in my Mississippi family, between the &#8216;Frats &amp; Suzies&rsquo; and the rest of us.</p>
<p>Those who &#8216;went Greek&rsquo; are pretty-much uniformly Cigarette-smoking alcoholics who love to gamble.  The rest of us abhor smoking, do not keep liquor in our homes, and have never set foot in a casino.</p>
<p>While the &#8216;Greeks&rsquo; at family gatherings loudly share stories of passing out on the Blackjack table, running the car off a pier in the Florida Keys, outrageous happenings at some Suzie&rsquo;s wedding&hellip; the rest of us whisper things like &#8220;This is making my skin crawl.  Everything they&rsquo;re talking about is disgusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The notions that Frat kids are &#8216;elite&rsquo;, &#8216;preppy&rsquo;, or even truly &#8216;white&rsquo; should be questioned.  &#8216;Cowardly&rsquo;, &#8216;conniving&rsquo; and &#8216;conformist&rsquo; would be better assumptions.  They&rsquo;re not training anybody to be tomorrow&rsquo;s anything.  They don&rsquo;t &#8216;character build&rsquo;, and they certainly aren&rsquo;t going to take a stand against anything that is part of the current Orthodoxy.  Diversity is the current Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>I was raised to believe that (even if it meant a second mortgage) I should go to Ole Miss and pledge Chi Omega.  But in eleventh grade, I got a peek inside the Chi O house, and was appalled.  Big portraits of Chi O&rsquo;s who&rsquo;d been Miss This, Miss That&hellip;  Sorry, but parading at a Pageant, in high-heels and a one-piece, like some hooker up for auction, was not my idea of &#8216;Elite&rsquo;, &#8216;Christian&rsquo; or even &#8216;Ladylike&rsquo;.  And it certainly isn&rsquo;t &#8216;preppy&rsquo;.  PREPPY refers to the no-nonsense, scholarly, Humanist, ultra-Protestant Norse culture of New England&rsquo;s boarding schools; not to the flashy, irresponsible AfroCeltic Southern culture of perpetual children, who cannot stand alone, as individuals.  </p>
<p>Southern &#8216;Greeks&rsquo;, I would add, are part of a culture with heavy African influences.  These kids and their forebears were raised by black maids, and their world view is as black as it is white.  That&rsquo;s why truly elite Southerners traditionally sent their kids off to New England to be educated: that they might become enculturated in environments free of the over-the-top foolishness that blacks have lent to Southern society.</p>
<p>As for &#8216;elite&rsquo; &#8216;Greeks&rsquo; being white&hellip;  It&rsquo;s a running joke in Jackson that the Frats at Ole Miss will take ANYTHING whose posterior looks good in Khakis, and that can pay the dues.  It IS a rare talent.  You have to have narrow hips and pumped-up Glutes to wear those singularly unflattering trousers.  Turns out a lot of &#8216;Mediterranean White&rsquo; boys have those attributes.  And so the Frats at Ole Miss are crawling with them&hellip;.playing Old South, in the silly uniforms, and mackin&rsquo; on blonde Suzies (generally while drunk as Cooter Brown, and smoking cigarettes).</p>
<p>For many of us, it is reflexive, when hearing someone&rsquo;s kid pledged &#8220;K.A.&#8221;, to roll our eyes and say &#8220;Oh, LORD!&#8221;.  We can&rsquo;t help it, any more than Armadillos can help jumping, when cars pass over them.</p>

		<p>The sad thing about garbage like this is that non-&#8220;activist&#8221; blacks in the South understand our fascination with our Southern cultural heritage (which some also share, being descendants of black Confederate soldiers).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the liberal establishment, previously the &#8220;anti-establishment&#8221; hippies who were in fact much like our liberal established government has been around since at least Woodrow Wilson, who &#8220;takes offense&#8221; at &#8220;symbols of oppression&#8221; while also very clearly stating that they&rsquo;re cool with euthanasia, eugenics, killing people for having the wrong political views, etc., that normal people might actually consider oppressive.</p>

<p>To be candid, Yes. I do think there was some degree of racism and disrespect. Of all the places these students could have stopped at on campus, to choose to stop in front of a Black  sorority house in confederate attire demonstrates a high level of arrogance and callousness. </p>

		<p>Will black history month be banned now at public universities? To do otherwise is racially insensitive and not politically correct. I would assume there will be no African flags allowed anywhere; that would be racially insensitive.  It&rsquo;s only fair to designate everyone a victim of racism, including me, because if my status as a victim is not acknowledged, that will constitute further victimization, which will be victimizing and racially insensitive.   </p>
<p>Is the milk in my latte&rsquo; racially insensitive, because if it were poured into a bowl of cereal instead, the coffee could be black.  Aren&rsquo;t Cracker Jacks being culturally insensitive to po&rsquo; folk in the South?  </p>

<p>Being that fraternity houses are usually built lining a road and a parade has to go somewhere there would be a great likelyhood that the parade passed in front of a black fraternity or soroity house of some kind. I could understand if they stopped and yelled obscene or threatening things at the members but this was not mentioned. Several of my family members are alumni of KA and often paraded or had pictures taken in Confederate (not rebel BTW although many Southerners have adopted the term) uniforms since we had ancestors that actually fought. Why is it that we had to respect your culture but you dont have to give a d@mn about and ridicule ours? </p>

<p>Did you ever think that the &#8216;house&rsquo; was on the parade route, like most of the other houses? Did you ever think that there might be an intersection ahead? Did you ever think? The obvious answer to the last one is &#8216;no&rsquo; ; you merely reacted as indoctrinated seeking to cause a stir. And why are you not upset at a &#8216;black only&rsquo; house? Where&rsquo;s the much vaunted and worshiped diversity? Certainly THAT is &#8216;raciss&rsquo;&hellip;<br>
I am appalled and saddened by the acquiescence of this, or any fraternity or other private, social group to the petty demands of the PC nazis. Amerika indeed holds little promise for the future if these are to be tomorrows leaders.</p>

<p>So what if they did stop in front of a black sorority house in Confederate attire? THEIR racial ancestors founded the United States of America, and their heritage is Southern. So bloody what if they celebrate who they are and their culture? If anyone should complain, it should be the Founding Population of this country for your presence and your race&rsquo;s incessant whining and demanding. YOU should be the ones to accept the fact that you&rsquo;re in a White-created nation and too bad if there are aspects of our history that you find unpalatable. </p>

		<p>Who cares what blacks think?  I&rsquo;m sick and tired of whites being whimps and cowering down to demands of blacks.  That actually makes them hate us more and respect us less.  I think whites, particularly the white southerners, should tell the university and the frat they are no longer supporting them and why.  If you tell them you won&rsquo;t give them money, their minds will open up really quickly!</p>

		<p>Regarding my #22 post, it now reads a bit harsh and perhaps I should have chosen more genteel wording. My point is that racial awareness is certainly more than a one-way street and it&rsquo;s time that others understand this. Anyway, as a Southerner, I would have preferred to have used a kinder set of remarks and now feel that my previous post was unnecessarily rude, which I regret.</p>

I am a Black woman and a AKA sorority sister. I attended a college in the northeast in the early to mid 1990s. My question is why did these young fraternity and sorority men and women stop in front of a Black sorority house dressed in confederate attire?&#8221;</p>
<p>My question to your question is why is there a black sorority house?  Can you imagine the screams of indignation of there was a white only sorority house?  What exactly does equality mean to you?</p>

<p>The fact is that Blacks have always respected other people&rsquo;s cultures, including Whites. I would advise you to reread your history. The fact is that Whites have historically bemoanded, discounted and ridiculed Black culture. If anything, it is Whites who harbor a &#8220;so what be damned&#8221; attitude toward Black and other non-White culture.</p>
<p><br>
John:</p>
<p>My question to you is why are you not upset by all those &#8220;White only&#8221; fraternity and sorority houses? When I was in college, we had several White women and a few Hispanic women in our sorority. The fact is that the Black greek system is much more racially inclusive (and more socially conscious)than the White greek system. As far as using terms like Nazis etc&hellip; No <br>
Black greek orgnization has ever had &#8220;White theme parties&#8221;, placed racially inflammatory pictures on the internet or engaged in related forms of retorgrade behavior that have been commonpace among many White greek organizations (mostly fraternities I will admit). Perhaps that is the sort of behavior you should be &#8220;appalled and saddened&#8221; by.</p>
<p>Southern Belle:  </p>
<p>No one has told anyone to refrain from celebrating their culture. Do not put word in my mouth. However, the fact is that it is our nation as much as it is yours. In fact, Blacks built this nation for nothing I might add. Remember slavery my dear? Whether you are willing to admit it or not, we as Blacks have a moral claim to this nation. We were bought here largely against our will, enslaved, robbed of our native mores and customs, forced to adopt a eurocentric culture and were deprived of our basic humanity and human dignity. Thus, if anyone has a moral claim to this nation, it is Black people.  <br>

		<p>Southern Belle #24 I liked you way better as #22. I hope you have third thoughts. By the by who gives a ratz what a bunch of G-eeks think anyway? Oh! and isn&rsquo;t Greece one of the most financially, and culturally broken countries in the world, and didn&rsquo;t they also worship false imaginary gods? So why do we get filled so full of G-eek mythology? Look up the meaning of mythology, hmmm I guess I just answered my own question, didn&rsquo;t I? Personally I believe Jeanette is a likely player, and you&rsquo;ve all been played. Personally I never appologize for something I meant. Whats that quote by Mr. Jefferson at the top of the page?</p>

<p>I happen to be up late tonight. It is a little after midnight here in Spokane. I just saw your most recent post. There were parts of my most recent post to you such as &#8220;remember slavery my dear&#8221; that were a little strong as well. I regret being so flippant. I do agree with you that racial awareness is a two-way street thus it is important for Whites, Blacks and other ethnic groups to understand this fact.  </p>

		<p>You are the one who needs to read recent history. Nobody is degrading your culture- quite the opposite. All you have to do is look around to see all of the White kids dressed as gangsta rappers and listening to hip hop. Whites are constantly told that we do not have a culture and anything that could &#8220;offend&#8221; increasingly thin skinned minorities is banned. There were more slaves under the American flag than under the Confederate Battle flag. It is also unbecoming to keep reminding us of slavery. There was probably not a racial group in existance that did not either keep slaves or were enslaved at some point in time. Unfortunate fact. Unless you can prove that the KA parade stopped in front of the house and made obscene gestures or hurled racial epithets then you cannot prove they were being racists. Grow a thicker skin!</p>

		<p>Well hush my mouth, I didn&rsquo;t realize blacks had always respected other cultures, thanks for enlightenin&rsquo; us y&rsquo;all. There has NEVER been a CIVILIZED black society. As for That moral claim thing, your own kind rounded up your ancestors and sold them into slavery, to whites here, and we have only suffered ever since. Now for a little history lesson, you should study American history instead of G-eek mythology. Since the white pioneers fled to America to escape tyranny. Plus the English were under Roman enslavement for hundreds of years. I challenge anyone to name the benefits whites have reaped from blacks, since we no longer need human cotton pickers. Now as to whether you can claim moral ground, you have certainly laid claim to all the benefits to be offered by this once great country. Short of writing a book, look to the name I use here on Amren, ps if I have offended you in anyway, oh well.</p>

<p>First of all, I do not understand why you, Lauren and some other posters are so HOSTILE toward fraternities and sororities. They are not much different than non-Greeks. They do alot of charity work, they are good social networks and many of them donate considerable mounts of money to their Alma maters. Like any group of people you are going to have your good individuals and bad elements. Many greeks are good people.</p>
<p>In regards to Jeanette, she has been petty civil (and pretty eloquent) in her comments. She might be a little over sensitive, and slightly paranoid, but the same can be said for many people, including a number of our own posters. </p>
<p>This past weekend, I was at my local public library with my three grandsons and happened to glance through a Black magazine that was left at the reference desk. There was an article about a history of Black sororities and it listed a number of them. One was named AKA. These organizations do exist.   </p>
<p>On another somewhat related note, some of the comments she has made such as Blacks having a moral claim to this nation have also been echoed by racially conscious Whites such as Jared Taylor and Pat Buchanan.</p>

<p>Hmmm, I happen to live in a certain part of this country where for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles in any direction, slavery most certainly built NOTHING.  NOTHING. That can be said for EVERY area of this country that had nothing to do with slavery.  Those areas make the &#8220;slavery&#8221; areas look minuscule.  Culture debate aside, try not to believe your own indoctrination too much.  The fact is, slave labor was used in a portion, a small portion geographically, of this nation for agricultural purposes not &#8220;building.&#8221;  Open up a map.</p>
<p>A tremendous portion of this nation was built in every fashion by white people.  That is a fact.  I realize the goal is to have history books re-written, but for now that is fact.  </p>

I intimated you are likely not the person you say you are. However I&rsquo;m obviously still PLAYING your game, if only to make some points. Also I find it strange you would pick that particular comment from all I said and twist the obvious meaning, to pretend being offended, just as when KA marched by you. The old change the subject when all else fails ploy certainly applies here. The only name I called you is uh, what would the ebonic word for false representation be?</p>

<p>Hell, the city of Seattle has more Blacks than the state of Maine. Where did you get this figure 700 Black people living in the state of Washington? Even 7000 would be inaccurate and too low. </p>
