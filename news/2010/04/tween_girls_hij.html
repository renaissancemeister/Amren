<h1>Tween Girls Hijack Idol</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Rushfield, Yahoo! News, April 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It will be generations before scientists fully understand the impact text messaging has had on our society. Accelerated communications, the condensing of complex thought into compact, emoticon-enriched half-phrases; these effects can merely be speculated upon now. But the fallout from one edge of the texting revolution is already stunningly clear and already having far-reaching effects on American culture; text messaging, it can now be definitively said, has transformed the electorate of American Idol from a diverse microcosm of the nation&rsquo;s broad middle, to a playground for willful 11-year-olds seeking to reshape the world in their image.</p>
<p>Armed with their text messaging superpowers, able to tirelessly deliver hundreds of votes each to a grown-up&rsquo;s five or ten, in the past few years, tween girls have stormed the ramparts of Idol democracy and  &mdash;  depending on your perspective  &mdash;  either wreaked havoc upon our national pastime, or given an aging show a fresh wind of underage relevance. Either way, they have made the Idol stage a very different place, and nowhere was the heavy hand of the tween dictators felt more strongly than at the Idoldome during Wednesday night&rsquo;s elimination show, where in the first big shocker of the season, Michael &#8220;Big Mike&#8221; Lynche found himself with the week&rsquo;s lowest vote total for the week.</p>
<p>The evidence for the rise of the tween voting block is anecdotal; Idol sadly releases no voter information beyond the number of ballots cast, and no independent study has been conducted of the electorate. However, careful study does point to an irrefutable fact, that in the past few years, &#8220;cute boys&#8221; have come to dominate American Idol to an unprecedented degree.</p>
<p>The show&rsquo;s knowledge of this trend was on display in the elimination rituals Wednesday night. In a bit of gotcha showmanship, the show began by bringing the three sole remaining females of the top nine to the stage, teasing with the notion that after women have been eliminated three weeks in a row, cutting their ranks in half, the voters would dispatch yet another to oblivion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week, however, the wrath of the tween girls did not fall upon their own gender, but upon another quirk in the block&rsquo;s predilections. Not only do they seem to prefer their Idols be male, but they also seem to prefer them to be white.</p>
<p>In making it as far as the number nine slot, Big Mike traveled as far as any African-American male has gone since Nikko Smith was eliminated on this same week in Season Four. Prior to that, no African-American male has made the Top Five since George Huff in Season Three, a good six years back. This despite the fact that every year, a sizable number of critically favored African-American men emerge from Hollywood Week, only to crumble like cannon fodder in the semi-finals rounds.</p>
<p>Such are, apparently, the whims of America&rsquo;s tweens.</p>

		<p>This man either has no idea of what he&rsquo;s talking about or is a liar. Ruben Studdard and Fantasia both won American Idol and were blacks, with Ruben being an &#8220;African-American male.&#8221; Funny how he left out the most relevant facts pertaining to his fictitious race crisis. His website claims that he&rsquo;s an &#8220;American Idol &#8216;scholar&rsquo;&#8221; so we can only assume these omissions are deliberate.</p>

		<p>Texting is now the condensation of complex thought?  I would have thought that texting more closely represents the transmission of primitive non-thought.</p>
<p>The irony of these interesting (if largely non-beneficial) gadgets is that not one percent of their users has any idea how any of this stuff works.  They know nothing of math, science, history, modern technology, or in what country the Vietnam war was fought. Never have so many hi-tech playthings been lavished on such a hopelessly ignorant and helpless generation, members of which would have no knowledge of how to change a tire, balance a checkbook, or find Japan (the source of so many of these goodies) on a map.</p>
<p>I suspect that these kids in many cases will find that their lives peaked at sixteen.  </p>

		<p>This is good news considering the all-black, all-the-time programming from MTV. The gulf between what media elites choose to impose and what real people really want is huge. The next huge show on a Seinfeld scale is just waiting to happen for the first producers brave enough to dump diversity.</p>

		<p>Like it or not most advertisers get most of their money from white people.  When the ratings for a show fall off, advertising becomes useless.  At first the show has a diverse mix, but somehow the white people get thinned out first.  This causes the reaction in voting.  I&rsquo;d wager that 11 year old white girls know a heck of a lot more about what they face from &#8220;minorities&#8221; as they get older.  They aren&rsquo;t stupid and are obviously clever enough to create an impressive hold on this show by virtue of their personal frustration.  These girls are TIRED of having inter-racial stuff shoved down their throats and have finally found an outlet for their frustration.  We may just see white America saved by one of these 11 year old girls!<br>

		<p>So young girls like cute boys&hellip;duh!  Perhaps they should do a 100 million dollar study as to why.  And figure out a cure!  Yes, they need a cure for 12 year old girls liking cute white boys.  Perhaps a mandatory vaczination.  This is news?  They should really spend more time investigating things like why water runs down hill or why cats give birth to kittens instead of donkeys.  Geeze.</p>

		<p>Of course these are the,&#8221;whims of American tweens.&#8221; Is that not the demographic programs like this are aimed toward? I&rsquo;ve never watched an episode American Idol myself, but I was rather convinced years ago that this is what I generally call &#8220;teeny-bopper&#8221; television - and would expect nothing different than the outcome noted in the article. White American children are attached to electronic devices like an older man to a pace-maker, thus this isn&rsquo;t much of a surprise is it?</p>
<p>Seems like just another excuse to gripe about a lack of blacks in any entertainment medium(or anything else for that matter). </p>

<p>Did you catch that?  No election, including something as silly as American Idol, can be legitimate or trusted unless the races of the voters are known and parsed.  Multiculturalists have no respect for democracy when whites get to vote.  </p>

		<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true that Ruben Studdard won.  But that was back in Season Two.  The author says, &ldquo;In making it as far as the number nine slot, Big Mike traveled as far as any African-American male has gone since Nikko Smith was eliminated on this same week in Season Four.&#8221;</p>
<p>American Idol is one of the few TV shows I watch.  Three of the last four winners have been white males.  No doubt AI is very upset about that!  They&rsquo;re obviously pushing for a girl to win this year.  </p>
<p>I notice every year they put through some Asians and Hispanics for &#8220;diversity,&#8221; and those contestants get voted off pretty quickly.  Not because of racism, (as others have pointed out, three blacks have won AI so far,) but because those contestants were chosen for their race and weren&rsquo;t very good!  One thing you can say for blacks, they CAN sing.  I believe that whites will vote for a talented black singer.</p>
<p>Every time a nonwhite is voted off American Idol, there are screams of &#8220;racism&#8221; all over the Internet, even if numerous white contestants were voted off even earlier.  When Big Mike got &#8220;saved,&#8221; he and the only other nonwhite&hellip;Hispanic Andrew Garcia&hellip;were in the bottom two.  I think they pretty much *had* to save Big Mike; otherwise, the screams of &#8220;racism&#8221; would be deafening!  But if Big Mike and Andrew are the bottom two again this week, that means they will both go home at the same time&hellip;and then there&rsquo;ll be all whites left!  That&rsquo;ll look pretty bad, and I bet the producers are praying that doesn&rsquo;t happen!</p>

Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself. The preference for White youth is because most of the tweens in America are White. You think it&rsquo;s odd since you&rsquo;re selectively noticing the minorities.</p>

<p>How odd, indeed!</p>
<p>Perhaps, the Marxists and other &ldquo;countercultural&rdquo; flower-freaks really did miss something in the late 1960s and early 1970s, that maybe they should have anticipated? This being, that culture is not a static edifice of nebulously Technicolor &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo; principles, but an equally malleable outgrowth of ever advancing technology, that is now becoming 3D in its &ldquo;evolutionary&rdquo; progress. Or better put, not dependent on the outmoded views of the Red social misfits of the 1950s and 1960s, that dominated our universities and sociopolitical life.</p>
<p>We might call these giddy little &ldquo;texting tweens,&rdquo; a new paradigm of social intercourse that has become more naturally inclined away from, the more destructive multicultural integrations that are the hallmark of the fading fancy of both the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; buffoons and treasonous &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; tyrants. They like what they like, and it isn&rsquo;t the swaggering crack dealer or an illiterate &ldquo;migrant,&rdquo; that they have been endlessly told &ldquo;might&rdquo; enrich them.</p>
<p>Reaction on the march; or simply, nature being a nurturer of young white girls all of a sudden?</p>
<p>You decide, but I say, may God let it be so!</p>

		<p>I have watched American idol and from what i have seen its the 3 white judges who compete against each other who can express the best on much love &amp; adoration they have for &#8220;Big Mike&#8221; and that mexican that has a large Tattoo on his neck..it was no surprize to me that they &#8220;saved&#8221; Big Mike..better White female &amp; male singers were let go by this Hollywood PC 3 whom they never gave a second thought about saving even though they definitely deserved it.If anything an article should of been written how blacks that have won American Idol won solely on the PC White vote..how many blacks u think call in to vote for white singers over there own? Nor does this writer mention that &#8220;Big Mike&#8221; broke protocol..i guess only minority contestants who are black can do this.I am referring to the song the contestant does to &#8220;save&#8221; himself..normal protocol is to sing again the song they last did when they received the lowest number of votes..in this case Big Mike had sung Eleanor Rigby which should have been the song he should have sung the previous night..but nope..he sang a totally differant song and out of genre..it is obvious to anyone with a brain that this show was a put on..the judges knew before the show began that Big Mike had received the lowest number of votes and they changed the rules to allow him to sing a song that he was more comfortable with..more &#8220;soulful&#8221;.But this is Hollywood, what u expect? Its like these self-hating white liberals rooting for an all black team to beat an all white team..whose the most hated college basketball team? Duke..why?Because they are almost all White.The White contestants voted off by the judges who deserved to be there or by the white liberal voters who voted out more deserving whites over less deserving minority singers..that should be the STORY.It was so obvious that this writer felt the need to put the spin on it by blaming it on &#8220;tweens&#8221;.The Fact is Big Mike did not deserve to be in the top  10 nor that mexican with a tatoo on his neck.They got there solely because they were minoritys.Tomorrow is double elimination because Big Mike got saved..wonder who will get voted out..no save available..white singers falling all over themselves and cryin tears &amp; actin heartbroken but happy that Big Mike was saved&hellip;lets see how happy they will be when they are voted off because of it..sacrificial lambs they are..but they dont lose cause Top Ten are already winners and in the money..they get to go on tour for a year..the fix is already in.PC always wins in Hollywood.</p>

It&rsquo;s only after the &#8220;boob tube&#8221; and the &#8220;public fool system&#8221; get through with these girls that many of them will start lusting after darker flesh.</p>

		<p>The tweens watching American Idol are white.  So they vote for cute white guys.  The horror.  Even 12-year-old white girls should love the black man, obviously.  We aren&rsquo;t getting to them soon enough.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this article is about what has happened since they introduced text message voting and 12-year-old girls flocked to it.  Not the show since its beginnings.  So the winners in the earlier seasons being mostly chicks and/or black actually validates the author&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>Concerned Citizen, the keywords are &#8220;as far as&#8221; and &#8220;since.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s not a lie, it&rsquo;s true.  Ruben Studdard won in season two.</p>

		<p>My God!!  What is this country coming to?  How could these 12 year old girls be so confused?  Diversity is this country&rsquo;s greatest strength, yet they have the audacity to cast votes for cute boys who look like them?  Obviously they are racists and this cannot stand!  A decree should be made that all public schools must have mandatory diversity training for 5th grade though graduation.  White tween girls think teenage white males are cute and then cast votes for them?  Blasphemy!  This cannot stand.  </p>

		<p>Wow, it looks like 12 year old girls are scandalicious and need some official attention.  The Multis are pretty desperate if they need to pick on the 12 year olds.  </p>

		<p>If this article is true, than this generation of white girls gives me hope for our people&rsquo;s future. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Perhaps, the Marxists and other &ldquo;countercultural&rdquo; flower-freaks really did miss something in the late 1960s and early 1970s, that maybe they should have anticipated? This being, that culture is not a static edifice of nebulously Technicolor &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo; principles, but an equally malleable outgrowth of ever advancing technology, that is now becoming 3D in its &ldquo;evolutionary&rdquo; progress. Or better put, not dependent on the outmoded views of the Red social misfits of the 1950s and 1960s, that dominated our universities and sociopolitical life.</p>
<p>We might call these giddy little &ldquo;texting tweens,&rdquo; a new paradigm of social intercourse that has become more naturally inclined away from, the more destructive multicultural integrations that are the hallmark of the fading fancy of both the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; buffoons and treasonous &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; tyrants. They like what they like, and it isn&rsquo;t the swaggering crack dealer or an illiterate &ldquo;migrant,&rdquo; that they have been endlessly told &ldquo;might&rdquo; enrich them.</p>
<p>Reaction on the march; or simply, nature being a nurturer of young white girls all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>We are lucky to have John PM share his wisdom - his writing is brilliantly white!</p>

		<p>My modest proposal for bypassing the rule of &#8216;The People&rsquo; would be for the votes to go to an Electoral College of sorts&hellip;.or&hellip;.better yet, to a House of Idol Representatives. American Idol would then function much more like a modern democracy, in that the elected body could proceed to completely ignore the will of the voters, and thus ensure that none but Blacks, Hispanics, and &#8216;bi-racials&rsquo; ever become &#8216;Idols&rsquo;, ever again.</p>

		<p>I would not put too much credibility in this story. The fact is that American Idol is a television show. It does not represent America. In fact, from what I see, a number of White females are all too eager to date and fornicate with Black males.</p>
