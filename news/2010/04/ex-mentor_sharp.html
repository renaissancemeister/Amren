<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20100418/US.Obama.Sharpton.Factor/">Ex-Mentor: Sharpton is Obama&rsquo;s Link to the Streets</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Verena Dobnik, Comcast News, April 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton is a &#8220;lightning rod&#8221; for President Barack Obama on inner city streets, Obama&rsquo;s former Harvard mentor and friend said Saturday at a forum in Harlem.</p>
<p>But Sharpton, who led the event, told The Associated Press that America&rsquo;s first black president &#8220;has to work both for us and for others,&#8221; and that if Obama were to push a race-based agenda, &#8220;that would only organize the right against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharpton spoke on the last day of an annual conference organized by his National Action Network. Speakers included three members of Obama&rsquo;s Cabinet and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, as well as Charles Ogletree, the president&rsquo;s Harvard Law School professor, now a friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Al Sharpton has become the lightning rod in moving Obama&rsquo;s agenda forward,&#8221; Ogletree told the AP, describing Sharpton as a conduit between the disadvantaged and powerful leaders. &#8220;And he has access to both the streets and the suites, to make sure that the people who are voiceless, faceless and powerless finally have some say.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sharpton clearly was at the center of this forum. Saturday, the front page of The Washington Post featured a photo of him with a headline that read: &#8220;Activist Al Sharpton takes on new role as administration ally.&#8221;</p>
<p>He chuckled at the notion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been as much in this White House as I was in George (W.) Bush&rsquo;s  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s only when Bush invited me to the White House, it was him reaching out; when Obama invites me, all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re allies,&#8221; Sharpton joked during a break, sitting in a pew on the altar that served as a high-tech stage.</p>
<p>Amid a heated national debate over whether black leaders should align themselves with the president, Sharpton has defended Obama against criticism from television host Tavis Smiley that &#8220;black folk are catching hell&#8221; and Obama should do more to help them.</p>
<p>Black Americans, Sharpton said, &#8220;need to solve our own problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The four-day conference, focusing on a 12-month plan of action for black leadership, brought together prominent figures from dozens of fields, tackling topics as diverse as finding jobs for men leaving prison and federal subsidies for black farmers.</p>

		<p>Are there any people - other than his fellow blacks - who actually care what this proven liar and slandering POS says or does??   The man is a boring hypocritical phony, incapable of telling the truth.  And where did he obtain his divinity degree (the one that entitles him to be called &#8220;Reverend&#8221;).?</p>

Rev. Al never did speak too clearly or too well, so I&rsquo;ll have to step in and clarify this one for him: </p>

		<p>Evidently, Al Sharpton is also Michael Steele&rsquo;s link to the streets and Nut Gingrich&rsquo;s link to the streets.  He&rsquo;s got no credibility, yet everyone runs to him as if he were some sort of credible authority.  Musn&rsquo;t be much of a street if you gotta go through Al Sharpton to get to it.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Black Americans, Sharpton said, &lsquo;need to solve our own problems.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>How laughable!</p>
<p>Does &ldquo;solving&rdquo; your own problems include: claiming that hoaxed rapes and murders of blacks are a reality; or maybe, it would be claiming that the piggish whoredom of a mulatto millionaire and chipmunk faced golfer is &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; when reported even on MSNBC?</p>
<p>Paranoid excuses, idiotic &ldquo;explanations,&rdquo; and bizarre broodings over his &ldquo;commoonity&rdquo; are only what Comrade Al is about. How odd that, considering the &ldquo;administration&rdquo; he now wants to blackmail.</p>
<p>The pun, is fully intended,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Still, he predicted, the new health care law would affect uninsured black Americans more than any other segment of the population.</p>
<p>Of course it will. Obama knew that it would, that&rsquo;s why he pushed it through. Whitey will now have to pay for any injuries the black thugs might get while in the process of raping, robbing, beating, murdering or &#8220;flash-mobbing&#8221; them. WHAT A COUNTRY!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been as much in this White House as I was in George (W.) Bush&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Which is one of the MANY reasons Bush was so unpopular with White realists. Why would a White president invite a black street thug like Al $harpton to the White House. In a sane world, he would&rsquo;ve only be there to clean up the dirty dishes.</p>

		<p>Al Sharpton is one of the most despicable human beings I have ever heard of.  All his lying and posturing, and taking up phony &#8220;causes&#8221; will never make him anything but a race-baiting rabble-rousing thug in a suit.  Mr. Sharpton sits on a stage in complete comfort, as though everyone is there to adoringly listen to his every word.  And I call him Mr., not reverend, because no man or woman should give themselves by a title that is mentioned but once in the Bible, and it is saying Holy andReverend is His Name.  It refers to God, not Al or any other man on earth.</p>

		<p>I totally agree with several things written here: Sharpton certainly IS a lightning rod. And blacks certainly need to solve their own problems. (Insert big guffaw here.) After all, they won&rsquo;t listen to or take advice from whites.</p>
<p>He may have access to the streets, the suites (AND the sweets - he might think about calling Jenny Craig); however, that&rsquo;s not necessarily a prestigious thing; so does the trash dude. Poor Sharpton; trying so hard to hang on to the coattails of what&rsquo;s left of the so-called &#8220;Civil Rights Movement&#8221;. What a slimeball.</p>

<p>I think you are right but wrong as to who it ios that has no credibility.  There is no difference between Obama, Steele, and Gingrich.  The words coming out of their mouths might be different but the behaviors are exactly the same.  That is because they all serve the same masters&hellip;.and they aren&rsquo;t us.</p>
<p>We need to get this in our country.  Learn to ignore the words and pay attention to the behaviors only.  More importantly, we need to follow the strings of these marrionettes upward to see who is pulling them.</p>

		<p>That this cartoonish lout Al Sharpton could be taken seriously in any company is a sad commentary on our political and social systems. That Obama feels compelled to pretend to listen to this buffoon says even more about the nature of our politics and our national discourse.</p>
<p>I can only imagine what the Chinese and Russians are thinking of this spectacle of two such gross aboriginals wielding such power on the world stage.</p>

		<p>Sharpton is the consumate race hustler. You have to admire his hutzpah, sheer arraogance and his amazing ability to live in absolute denial of reality. He is the ultimate player in shaking-down old whitey for the black race and has made quite a nice personal bundle out of it. If I was black I&rsquo;d be mad as hell and embarrassed that this person speaks for me. Then again I&rsquo;m looking at it from a white person&rsquo;s perspective so analogies may be completely skewed. Perhaps it&rsquo;s part of &#8220;being black&#8221; that these kinds of people are lauded, excused all larceny and pandered to. What amazes me is that white politicians do the same. -Why do people keep voting for them?</p>

		<p>Ever since the Tawana Brawley debacle, Sharpton has zero cred, on the street or anywhere else. He&rsquo;s a race-hustling poverty pimp and that&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;ll ever be&hellip;</p>
