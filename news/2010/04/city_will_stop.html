<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/nyregion/31cash.html?hp">City Will Stop Paying the Poor for Good Behavior</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Bosman, New York Times, March 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An unusual and much-heralded program that gave poor families cash to encourage good behavior and self-sufficiency has so far had only modest effects on their lives and economic situation, according to an analysis the Bloomberg administration released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The three-year-old pilot project, the first of its kind in the country, gave parents payments for things like going to the dentist ($100) or holding down a full-time job ($150 per month). Children were rewarded for attending school regularly ($25 to $50 per month) or passing a high school Regents exam ($600).</p>
<p>When the mayor announced the program, he said it would begin with private money and, if it worked, could be transformed into an ambitious permanent government program.</p>
<p>But city officials said Tuesday that there were no specific plans at this time to go forward with a publicly financed version of the program. {snip}</p>
<p>But the elementary and middle school students who participated made no educational or attendance gains. Neither did high school students who performed below basic proficiency standards before high school.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;re being kind.</p>
<p>In college sociology 101, I learned that you can&rsquo;t bribe people to improve their lives. Motivation is an internal drive, not external.</p>
<p>One would think these ivy league elites would would be familiar with basic sociology but I suspect they&rsquo;re too busy writing an absurd doctoral thesis on how social science is wrong and they know better.</p>
<p>I have long since stop believing that these so-called educated elites are intelligent (with the exception of Mr. Taylor who apparently graduated Yale when it still meant something).<br>

		<p>This program was announced three years ago.  I knew it was going to be a flop.  The reason is that those who did those things for which they would be paid small cash sums and did it because it was a matter of pure common sense or self-respect, weren&rsquo;t really going to be poor if they were non-white.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer thinks the reasons it flopped is because:  (1)  There weren&rsquo;t sticks attached to these carrots, and (2)  This program was modeled after similar programs in Mexico and other similar countries, but those programs there have lower expectations.</p>

		<p> Every time I think I&rsquo;ve heard everything, the liberal dispensers of our hard-earned largesse surprise me again. Paying people for going to the dentist?! Or going to school? (Used to be parents got into trouble if their kids DIDN&rsquo;T go to school.) I guess they call this &#8220;Positive reinforcement.&#8221; Like parents who &#8220;reward&#8221; their kids for doing chores, instead of making them understand that there&rsquo;s no free ride or free lunch in life, and that you have to pull your own weight   &mdash;   sink or swim.</p>
<p> But there! What quaint, old-timey notions I&rsquo;m outlining! I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve been declared &#8220;patriarchal,&#8221; &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; by those who Know What&rsquo;s Best For Us.</p>
<p> At least this idiotic scheme proved how nonsensical it was before it morphed into another government raid on the taxpayers&rsquo; wallets.</p>

		<p>Seems like the typical liberal solution to all inner city problems-just throw money at it.</p>
<p>BTW, just a remark from my position in NYC Diversity Hell, my Afro colleagues absolutely HATE Mayor Bloomberg. They will mock him with a nerdy, Jewish accent and ascribe so many horrible things to him. He&rsquo;s no hero to me, in fact he errs on the liberal side, but all in all he&rsquo;s done at least an OK job, not like the Dinkins Administration.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hardly surprising that the program didn&rsquo;t work.  Like other normal people, I go to the dentist to keep my teeth, not to collect $100 for acting like a grown up.</p>
<p>At least this was paid for by some rich fool&rsquo;s own money.  When I see other rich people buy collections of trash labeled &#8220;modern art&#8221; it&rsquo;s a wonder to me that people so stupid about ordinary things can be smart enough to make so much money.<br>

		<p>Just when I thought I&rsquo;d heard it all. This has to be the dumbest damn thing I&rsquo;ve read in weeks. Pay these people for good behavior, such as holding down a job? WHAT!!!? I have a better idea. If you don&rsquo;t work, you don&rsquo;t eat. If they quit or are fired from a job, too bad! NO WELFARE FOR YOU! If you don&rsquo;t graduate high school, you are automatically disqualified from any future social services. Cut them off! Force them to sink or swim. No more nanny state would NY be!</p>

<p>I remember hearing of a similar &#8220;incentive&#8221; (i.e. bribery) program with Canadian Indian schoolkids in the &rsquo;90s. Some socialist genius in the Board of Ed decided the way to combat the chronic truancy and/or lateness of Indian children was to give them a candy bar every time they showed up for school. I think they got more candy if they showed up on time. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear about this candy-bar bribery any more   &mdash;   so I&rsquo;m assuming it flopped and was dropped just like Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s bribery program. The poster who quoted Steve Sailer was right: the whole idea has too much carrot, not enough stick. In fact, I can&rsquo;t see a stick here anywhere, in either the NYC or the Canadian program: in both systems all I see are carrots. </p>
<p>But at least candy bars aren&rsquo;t as bad as $600 cash payments! </p>

		<p>The city may stop this practice, however they and the country, will continue to bribe [poor people/code word] with entitlements to prevent them from rioting. Stop the welfare state and we suffer the consequences. We should go back to the Jewish law that stated, &#8220;if you don&rsquo;t work you don&rsquo;t eat.&#8221; We are in essence actually rewarding these indigents for their BAD behavior, out of fear of reprisal. Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive. The cultural war is being won by the racists on the left, who claim not to be racist, yet you will know them by their deeds. Oh! the horrors that await us, mark these words: martial law is just around the corner, awaiting a stroke of the pen of the avenging king. MY fellow subjects of the king, go to &#8220;presidential directives&#8221; on your computer and read &#8216;em and weep.</p>

		<p>If it is funded with private money, shouldn&rsquo;t we all get those payments for doing those things?  Bring it back.  That $100 will help me pay for my trip to the dentist, and you don&rsquo;t need any &#8216;sticks&rsquo; to make me go!</p>
<p>Seriously, when this program was first announced, the young 20 something liberal white teachers where I&rsquo;m at had mixed feelings about it.  Some of them actually grew a little backbone and bristled at the obvious pandering of it all.</p>

		<p>Sociologists are still trying to &#8216;prove&rsquo; Boas&rsquo;s thoroughly disproved theory that &#8216;we are all the same!&rsquo; and that &#8216;race is a social construct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If it were true, the lefties wouldn&rsquo;t insist on living behind 24-hour guarded iron gates and sending their children to exclusive private schools  &mdash;  while insisting that YOUR White neighborhood be &#8216;blessed&rsquo; with Section 8 refugees from somali or proclaim that YOUR White child&rsquo;s schools is &#8216;too White&rsquo;, needs diversity and therefore the buses bringing violent blacks from the inner city will be rolling tomorrow. </p>
<p>But that is nothing new; the lefties in power still insist that the achievement gap can be closed  &mdash;   but oh yeah!,  they&rsquo;ll need more money, more studies, more new theoretical  programs, more teacher training.  </p>
<p>And they always get whatever they ask for, more money for the poor, more studies, more programs, more &#8216;help&rsquo; so the poor can pull themselves up, more proclamations that the poor are that way due to (fill in the msm&rsquo;s pre-coded blank with any of the following) racism, a White power structure, White Supremacism, non-White terror of White Militia.</p>
<p>And this time the program will work!  Just like the War of Poverty worked, NCLB worked, paying the poor to &#8216;act right&rsquo; worked.</p>
<p>Makes one think that the trillions of dollars and implementation of programs that are doomed from the start to fail aren&rsquo;t about closing the achievement gap or making lazy, government parasites into hard-working, high-achieving, focused, productive and law-abiding citizens fitting the individualistic mode of American ideals. </p>
<p>I believe there are two central government plans going on here:  These endless programs to &#8216;lift up the poor&rsquo; are implemented to placate non-White activists and assure the lefties of the non-White voting bloc AND they cover the other, more important goal of destroying White American civilization and culture via satanic taxes, destruction of White neighborhoods via Section 8 housing and busing, and unleashing terror on Whites.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working just as planned.</p>

<p>Now if we can get the results broken down along racial lines so there is full information, this study will be hard to counter in any argument.   </p>

<p>NOPE.  I listened to Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s weekly radio show last Friday.  Someone called in about illegal aliens and the drain on NYC&rsquo;s budget.  The Mayor corrected the caller (the term in undocumented migrant) and then went on to explain how most illegals are young, healthy, childless, tax payers who receive very little in the way of public services.  Obviously the mayor has never been to a welfare office or hospital emergency room.</p>
<p>To give the devil his due   &mdash;   the Mayor is an excellent manager but his social views are up there with Karl Marx.</p>
