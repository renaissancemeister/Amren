<p>In March, Stanford New Schools (aka East Palo Alto Academy)  &mdash;  a charter high school started in 2001 and elementary grades added in 2006  &mdash;   made California&rsquo;s list of schools in the lowest-achieving five percent in the state.</p>
<p>This month, the Ravenswood school board denied a new five-year charter. The elementary school  &mdash;  now with K-4 and eighth grade  &mdash;  will close in June. Another year or two wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to improve poor student performance and weak behavior management, Superintendent Maria De La Vega told the board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>How did it happen? Stanford New Schools, run by the university&rsquo;s school of education, seems to stress social and emotional support over academics.</p>
<p>Stanford New Schools hires well-trained teachers who use state-of-the-art progressive teaching methods; Stanford&rsquo;s student teachers provide extra help. With an extra $3,000 per student raised privately, students enjoy small classes, mentoring, counseling and tutoring, technology access, field trips, summer enrichment, health van visits, community college classes on campus, and community service opportunities. The goal is to send graduates to college as critical thinkers, lifelong learners, and &#8220;global citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>EPA Academy enrolls very disadvantaged students: Most are the children of poor and poorly educated Spanish-speaking immigrant families; the rest are black or Pacific Islanders. Their English skills are poor. Those who come in ninth grade are years behind in reading and math.</p>
<p>In comments on the news stories that have run, I see a common refrain: It&rsquo;s impossible to teach these kids. Not even Stanford can do it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aspire co-founded East Palo Alto Academy High with Stanford, but bowed out five years ago. There was a culture clash, Aspire&rsquo;s founder, Don Shalvey told the New York Times. Aspire focused &#8220;primarily and almost exclusively on academics,&#8221; while Stanford focused on academics and students&rsquo; emotional and social lives, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given the horrendous drop-out rate for Ravenswood students who go to large public high schools  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s estimated only one out of three receives a diploma  &mdash;  EPA Academy is helping students stay in school.</p>
<p>But its graduates are not prepared for college.</p>
<p>The 96 percent college admission rate is meaningless, since it includes community colleges, which take anyone, and California State University campuses, which admit students with a B average or better, regardless of test scores.</p>
<p>EPA Academy students are graded on a five-dimensional rubric, based on (1) Personal Responsibility; (2) Social Responsibility; (3) Communication Skills; (4) Application of Knowledge; and (5) Critical and Creative Thinking.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On CSU&rsquo;s test of college readiness, no EPA Academy 11th graders were deemed ready for college English; only 11 percent were deemed ready for college-level math. Of course, they might catch up in 12th grade. But the state exam shows 11th graders are far behind. In English Language Arts, 54 percent are below basic, 40 percent basic, and only 6 percent proficient. No students tested as proficient in Algebra II or chemistry, 9 percent in biology, and 6 percent in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The median scores for SAT takers are in the high 300s in each section, about the 15th percentile. ACT scores average 15, equally low.</p>

		<p>The only kind of charter school that is able to show some success with black and Hispanic middle school students is KIPP.  However, KIPP kicks out troublemakers and low achievers, and applies an insane amount of resources and time to the education of the students that they deem worth the time and money.  And after all that, it only brings them close to the white average for their age group.</p>

		<p>We have now known for several decades that intellegence is largely inherited.  Really dumb people have, on average, really dumb children.  The effects of low IQ are magnified, because dumb people cannot get into college, cannot get high-paying jobs, and they make poor choices.  The ressult is that low-IQ people wind up living in slums.  Hence, when a &#8220;charter school&#8221; concentrates on &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; youth from a poor neighborhood, it is really simply selecting the lowest-IQ kids to try and educate.  This is of course an impossible task.  That is why after 45 years of spending Billions of Dollars and attempting every imaginable remedy possible, Afircan-Americans, Hispanics (=MesoAmerican Indians), and Somans still fail education at astronomic rates.  </p>
<p>We simply cannot alter genes by applying innovate and expensive educational methods.</p>

		<p>I am DELIGHTED to see the snooty Palo Alto Stanfordians have to admit that their pet educational theories are a blatant failure.  Stanford in the West epitomizes the Ivy League super extremist liberal approach to education and everything else.  If it has failed in the hands of the elite, it&rsquo;s going to fail everywhere else also.  This case should be brought to the attention of every school board in California, so that they can see that the far-out liberal, &#8220;everybody wins, no competition&#8221; model is stupid, unrealistic, and unproductive.  They&rsquo;ve found out what we in education have known for years:  that you are NOT going to make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear, no matter what kind of magical potion you pour onto it.  It isn&rsquo;t gonna happen.  So let the uncooperative blacks and Hispanics educate their OWN kids and let the white and Asian kids be homeschooled by THEIR own parents and siblings.  No matter how you do it, the white and Asian kids are going to win academically every time.  My thanks to Stanford for finally proving what AmRenners have been saying for years:  Race DOES make a difference, and vive la difference!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the majority of leftist fanatics realize the intelligence gap between blacks and everybody else is the reason blacks can&rsquo;t learn at the same level, but they refuse to accept it, preferring to pretend to believe everybody has about the same abilities.</p>
<p>And it is this refusal to accept reality that causes so much turmoil and chaos in trying to educate blacks to reach the same level as everytbody else.</p>
<p>The only way to solve the black problem for any community is to have no blacks, which is the best alternative even if it requires relocating to the mountains of Idaho and setting up a large white community.</p>

		<p>I teach in an urban district.  My school is 100% non-white.  You would not believe all the pretend learning that goes on in such schools.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Portfolios of student growth&#8221; replace tests.  Social experiences like dancing (all the time) and music (without end) are integrated in the &#8216;curriculum.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>When I was hired, the interviewer stressed to me (through her leading questions which I saw right through and responded accordingly) that old-fashioned measures of excellence such as homework, tests and real competence were not to be the &#8216;sole&rsquo; measures of how we grade the students.  Rather, we should grade them in a &#8216;wholistic&rsquo; fashion, taking into account the &#8216;whole&rsquo; child.</p>
<p>Students in my high school are, on average, and in my expert opinion and observation, at about a third grade level in academics of all categories.  The new Teach for America (modern Peace Corp) teachers play all these fun games in class and do little projects all the time (they love to have the students do everything on computer), yet the students never improve.  I teach in the old fashioned way, and my students are doing much better than the rest, relatively speaking, of course.</p>

<p><br/>
&#8220;&hellip;I am DELIGHTED to see the snooty Palo Alto Stanfordians have to admit that their pet educational theories are a blatant failure&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>They admitted no such thing.  When has ANY lefty school official,  educational theorist in a university ivory tower, or government educational official EVER admitted that the latest fad program, the one that &#8216;will close the achievement gap, and costing billions of dollars, was a failure  &mdash;  as every single fad program has proved to be?</p>
<p>From the extended article (not the snipped version here):  </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Professor Linda Darling-Hammond, who helped create the high school, defended the high school&rsquo;s &#8216;strong, highly personalized college-going program.&rsquo; The graduation rate of 86 percent exceeds the state average. In addition, 96 percent of graduates are admitted to college (including 53 percent to four-year colleges)  &mdash;  twice the rate of African American and Latino students in the state as a whole.&rsquo; Half the students enroll in Early College classes on campus&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Who do you think the msm will quote, a Professor of Education from Stanford who deems her pet program a success or the realist writing for something called &#8216;pamaja media&rsquo;?</p>
<p>You could &#8216;lecture&rsquo; the professor on such hard statistics as these:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;On CSU&rsquo;s test of college readiness, no EPA Academy 11th graders were deemed ready for college English.  In English Language Arts, 54 percent are below basic, 40 percent basic, and only 6 percent proficient. No students tested as proficient in Algebra II or chemistry, 9 percent in biology, and 6 percent in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The median scores for SAT takers are in the high 300s in each section, about the 15th percentile. ACT scores average 15, equally low&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>and she would either ignore the stats, spin them in her favor, claim they are bogus or racist, claim the statisticians are racist and continue to peddle her garbage to the media and government.</p>
<p>Even then, the professor would still call the program a success.  After all, her job is not in jeopardy and she, without admitting any fault, will be tapped again to come up with another ridiculous educational plan that will cost billions of dollars and will be implemented state-wide to educate those with IQs of 80-90  &mdash;  because SHE believes and would like everyone else to believe that &#8216;There Are No Differences in IQ!&rsquo;  &mdash;  statistics be D***!  &#8216;If non-White children fail it is because they live in a racist, oppressive culture that doesn&rsquo;t value them!&rsquo; (These are the mantras in ed schools and woe be to anyone who challenges these marxist slogans).</p>
<p>I give the college readiness test and the CST (California State Tests) and well know what is on them  &mdash;  both are ridiculously easy.  Let me repeat that:  BOTH ARE RIDICULOUSLY EASY.  They have been dumbed down repeatedly and what is left is almost embarrassing elementary-level reading and writing, the college readiness mostly writing a very very easy essay of the autobiographical type  &mdash;  perfect for relating an aggrieved non-White sob story of hardship and racism.</p>
<p>Could you imagine if this money were poured into your precious White child instead?  A child with an IQ well over 100, a child that actually has a chance to go to a major university, major in chemistry, engineering, mathematics, physics, medicine  &mdash;  and succeed?  </p>
<p>NO, in the upside-down world of education, your intelligent White child is ignored, shunted aside, has his AP and honors programs de-funded with the money going to programs for the lowest IQ&rsquo;d students, and is placed in mainstream classes with SED (severely emotionally disturbed students) and retarded children as they are now considered &#8216;educable&rsquo; and it is a violation of their &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; if they are not exposed to the same educational standards and put in the same classroom as your bright White child (it&rsquo;s happening because educating these children separately is breaking the school districts financially, but that is another story).</p>
<p>Your bright White child will be used to tutor retarded students, as both of my children were asked to do during instructional time (answer NO and NO), holding back their educations.</p>
<p>I write this from over two decades of experience in a classroom and as a </p>

		<p>The 96 percent college admission rate is meaningless not only for the reasons the article describes, but because any &#8220;student&#8221; &#8220;educated&#8221; on this feel-good drivel will not be able to handle genuine university work, and will flunk out in their freshman year.  A six percent proficiency in English means that 94 percent of these high school grads will be unable to write coherent essays for their African Transgender Basketweaving Studies courses&hellip; &#8220;dem bad wite mens be raciss an keep us fom be haben things an stuff.  Gnome sayin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No student tested proficient in Algebra II&hellip;&#8221;  That seems to effectively lock them out of any science or engineering major, so despite government&rsquo;s endless prattle about training the next generation of American scientific minds, this school is really only grooming the next generation of illiterate, grievance-mongering diversity coordinators.</p>

		<p>These schools are coddling their students, which is the worse thing you can do to them. Teach them something they can use, like a trade. They love cars and stereos, so teach them how to repair them and make them. These kids graduate with a diploma that is not even worth the paper it was printed on.</p>

<p>Just as self-esteem programs didn&rsquo;t work, social and emotional support programs won&rsquo;t work either.</p>

		<p>I often wonder how much our government&rsquo;s program of malgenics (AKA welfare) has exacerbated this problem.  For 4 generations we have payed the laziest, stupidest segment of our society (including large numbers of blacks) to breed at our expense.  I have to believe that the result is that our modern black population is even less intelligent than it was before liberals intervened.</p>

		<p>The main problem is how much support do these kids get at home? Do their parent or guardian make them do their homework before they can go out to play or watch tv? Do they check their child&rsquo;s homework before they turn it in to the teacher the next day? The school can only do so much, the rest has to come from the parent/guardian of that child. In fact, when I was a child, my mother went to all scheduled parent teacher conferences. The teachers would tell her the ones that they want to see, never come.</p>

<p>Your comment about Teach for America reminded me of something. My husband and I were watching &#8220;Are you smarter than a 5th Grader&#8221; a few weeks ago. The contestant was a Teach for America teacher in a &#8220;low income&#8221; school. The question was about people storming the Bastille in the revolution of 1789. She was asked in what city the Bastille was located. She said Rome, Italy. Jeff Foxworthy asked her if she had ever heard of Bastille Day and she said no. Later on at another question she stated that she taught World History. </p>

		<p>The horrible waste here, to me, is that these kids ARE capable of learning.</p>
<p>They could be learning how to do farm work, how to clip hedges with precision, how to hang wallpaper, how to paint (walls, not canvases), how to assist electricians, how to be good menial hospital workers&hellip;</p>
<p>And they could be out in the workforce, by age 17.</p>
<p>These kids miss out on learning what they COULD do.  Instead, they endure years of frustration, basically learning that they are incapable of learning.</p>

		<p>To poster #23.  Most people do not, and cannot, of course, understand how little our Teach for America &#8216;graduates&rsquo; actually know.  I am in shock at how helpless they are when it comes to real knowledge of any kind that is integral to the subjects they claim to teach.  How many times has a frantic TFA &#8216;teacher&rsquo; ran to me to confirm a fact or ask how certain things fit together in the big picture.  </p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not that old, but I went to college in the 90s and we still had to - like, you know, read actual books and pass content tests!  Today&rsquo;s teachers need only spout drivel about social justice, historical oppression, blah, blah, blah, and then they&rsquo;re thrust in a classroom to do the most basic, brain-whithering projects you can imagine.</p>
<p>Another poster hit the nail on the head on another issue:</p>
<p>&#8220;Your bright White child will be used to tutor retarded students, as both of my children were asked to do during instructional time (answer NO and NO), holding back their educations.&#8221;</p>
<p>I teach in a 100% latino school, and many of the south american kids are actually quite bright, but they are constantly being &#8216;paired&rsquo; with dim-wit dominicans and well-meaning but clueless mexicans and the smart kids can&rsquo;t stand it.  They&rsquo;re being held back by the teachers who are using them as cheap helpers (in the absence of paraprofessionals and special ed aids).</p>
<p>Gary Orfield and his ilk actually say it loudly that minority kids are being &#8216;shortchanged&rsquo; by not being put in classrooms with whites.  Hey, why not do even better and put the black kids with asians?  That&rsquo;ll get &#8216;em, off our backs!</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;They&rsquo;re being held back by the teachers who are using them as cheap helpers (in the absence of paraprofessionals and special ed aids)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The vast majority of paraprofessionals, clerks, special ed aides and teachers&rsquo; aides are dumber and less educated than the kids they&rsquo;re supposed to help  &mdash;  most have very limited educations, low IQs (high school diplomas are a joke) and can barely read and compute themselves .  In over two decades, I have had only one aide who was actually able to help students academically  &mdash;  and she was the daughter of an Asian administrator.  </p>
<p>I use aides to run menial errands such as to xerox, collect mail and remove thugs from my room.  </p>
<p>In the district I work for, jobs such as paraprofessional, clerk and teachers&rsquo; aide are make-work, life-long positions for uneducated non-Whites. </p>
<p>As for my White children being asked to tutor retarded or disinterested students, I always answer this way:   NO, unless my child receives a portion of the teacher&rsquo;s paycheck.</p>
