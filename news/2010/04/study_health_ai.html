<h1>Study: Health Aid Made Some Countries Cut Budgets</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maria Cheng, Washington Post, April 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After getting millions of dollars to fight AIDS, some African countries responded by slashing their health budgets, new research says.</p>
<p>For years, the international community has forked over billions in health aid, believing the donations supplemented health budgets in poor countries. It now turns out development money prompted some governments to spend on entirely different things, which cannot be tracked. The research was published Friday in the medical journal Lancet.</p>
<p>Experts analyzed all available data for government spending on health in poor countries and the aid they received. International health aid jumped from about $8 billion in 1995 to almost $19 billion in 2006, with the United States being the biggest donor.</p>
<p>{snip} But many in Africa  &mdash;  including those with the worst AIDS outbreaks  &mdash;  trimmed their health spending instead. In the Lancet study, for every dollar received from donors, poor countries transferred up to $1.14 originally slated for their health budgets elsewhere. The research was paid for by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The research raises questions about whether international aid is sometimes detrimental. Previous studies have found pricey United Nations health initiatives haven&rsquo;t paid off and occasionally hurt health systems. Experts estimate about half of international health aid can&rsquo;t be traced in the budgets of receiving countries.</p>
<p>{snip} Activists like Bob Geldof and Bono have long argued canceling African debts would allow countries to spend more on their health problems, but there was no evidence of that.</p>

		<p>Bono and Bob Geldof have to be the two most tedious windbags in rock history. In the 70s Geldof wrote songs bashing the heroic Ian Smith yet he now pimps for African kleptocrats.</p>
<p>I like where the article mentions the African dictators stealing $ meant for health care for their poor in order &#8220;to spend on entirely different things, which cannot be tracked.&#8221; </p>
<p>In other words limos, private jets, bling and hookers.</p>

		<p>This only shows that these governments are more clever than previously thought. If the donors want to support the treatment of AIDS - let them! The freed money can be diverted to other things. Stands to reason.</p>

		<p>Simple, very practical economics:  if you give me a loaf of bread and a quart of milk why would I bother to go and buy bread and milk?  Might as well get a beer wih the money. These &#8220;leaders&#8221; are not interested in their peoples well being.  It is time to let them sink or swim.</p>

		<p>The west is sooo naive when it comes to dealing with Africa.<br>
You believe these people think in the same way and have the same concern &amp; ideologies as western people.</p>
<p>I could have told you 50 years ago about how these people think but no one would have believed me or any other critic.  It has taken an awful long time for the west to catch on.  How long for the west to take some action&hellip;.like stopping all aid until Africa can prove it is worthy of assistance</p>

		<p>&#8220;International health aid jumped&hellip;  with the United States being the biggest donor.&#8221;</p>
<p>With health care being subsidized by Mr. and Mrs. American taxpayer, African budgets are freely directed at weapons and other manufactured goods.</p>
<p>Wake up, sheeple. The transfer of wealth from the West to Africa is a scam run by the middlemen, with the complicity of our governments. The scam has been running for the past 50 years, and it&rsquo;s now so huge it&rsquo;s a pillar of global finance.</p>

		<p>Left out of this little discussion is what exactly that money was spent on.</p>
<p>The answer is weapons used to slaughter innocent people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a number of articles interviewing various warlords as they shamelessly describe either stealing food aid through various scams or more indirectly use it as a weapon of war.  With food aid, the men they normally would be forced to keep in the fields producing food, are free to rape, murder and pillage.  They LAUGH at the United States and the western world over this (it never even crosses their mind that they are harming themselves, let alone that what they are doing is wrong).</p>
<p>War in africa is about two things.  Who gets to steal American aid and who gets to produce drugs to sent over here as a thank you.</p>
<p>Nobody is honest about these things.  Nonbody cares.  It&rsquo;s all about being able to feel smugly superior donating &#8220;other people&rsquo;s money&#8221; and never mind the incredible harm being done there (and here) because of it.</p>
<p>There are a handful of ultra-religious, ultra-dedicated saints who dedicate their lives to helping those that can be helped.  Ironically, they are pariahs among the aid groups and have to do what they do with little support or resources.</p>
