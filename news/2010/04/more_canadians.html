<h1>Young Educated Urban Couples Prompt Substantial Leap in Mixed Marriages</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Dempsey, The Canadian Press, April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Qais Ghanem, a Muslim originally from Yemen, found love as a university student in the 1970s.</p>
<p>His bride? A Christian woman from England. His parents? Not impressed. &#8220;There was disappointment on my side of the family,&#8221; Ghanem says. &#8220;You know, birds of a feather flock together? That&rsquo;s how people often feel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward 40 years and he and his wife, Valerie Ghanem are no longer an out-of-the-ordinary pairing. The Ottawa husband and wife are one of 289,400 mixed-race Canadian couples  &mdash;  a number that a new Statistics Canada report suggests is a third higher than it was less than a decade ago.</p>
<p>The report, which comes from 2006 census data, indicates most of today&rsquo;s mixed unions are between couples who are young, from urban areas and represent a higher than average socio-economic class.</p>
<p>The number of intermarriages increased 33.1 per cent since 2001, according to the report and mixed couples now account for 3.9 per cent of all unions.</p>
<p>That kind of growth may look like a surge, but a professor at Queen&rsquo;s University and expert in multiculturalism says the number of mixed marriages in Canada is low considering our multicultural make-up.</p>
<p>Audrey Kobayashi says it&rsquo;s difficult to compare rates of mixed marriages globally because many countries factor religious background into the mixed union equation. Statistics Canada does not and Kobayashi sees this as problematic.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a large picture and we&rsquo;re not seeing all of the picture here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The picture the study does show is that second, third and fourth generation Canadians are more likely to marry outside of their race. Kobayashi says this has a lot to do with changes in personal identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;People meet at university, for example, and their identity has more to do with what they&rsquo;re studying or with what their subsequent occupations are, perhaps, than with their ethno-cultural history.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says setting is a big factor. In places like university campuses intermarriage is more acceptable than it might be in places where mixed pairings are not as common.</p>
<p>The number of mixed couples who live in rural areas, for example is small at 1.4 per cent compared with 5.1 per cent of Canadians living in metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>A disturbing example of violence against a mixed race couple is playing out in rural Nova Scotia. Early one morning in February, a family in the community of Poplar Grove woke to find a two-metre-high burning cross with a noose draped around it aflame on their front lawn. When they stepped outside they heard someone shout a racial slur in their direction. The couple&rsquo;s five children were at home at the time.</p>
<p>Shayne Howe, who is black, and Michelle Lyon, who his white, had lived in the community for six years without incident.</p>
<p>Two men were charged in connection with the cross-burning and the couple received an outpouring of support from the community. But just this past weekend the situation intensified when Lyon discovered her car had been gutted by fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s an extreme example, but it&rsquo;s also an indication that mixed couples still have a very difficult time in our society,&#8221; Kobayashi says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people are not going to burn a cross on your lawn, but they&rsquo;ll give sidelong looks and that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many mixed couples live in rural communities without incident.</p>
<p>Isabelle Blanchard, who was born in Ottawa to Chinese parents, married a man from Embrun, Ontario last September. She now lives with her husband next door to his family&rsquo;s dairy farm in Embrun, a town 40 kilometres outside of Ottawa with a population of about 8,000 people.</p>
<p>Blanchard says their parents had no concerns about race and the couple hasn&rsquo;t had a problem in the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody I&rsquo;ve met has really been welcoming,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Ghanem, who has lived in Ottawa for nearly 20 years, says his family has had the same experience. His eldest daughter married a man from New Zealand a few years ago and Ghanem says he was thrilled.</p>
<p>Ghanem, now a physician who is director of the Sleep Centre at the Ottawa Hospital, considers it his passion to break down cultural barriers. Several years ago he began hosting a radio show called Dialogue with Diversity, which airs on CHIN Radio. After discovering that many of the people he interviewed for the show were in mixed marriages, he decided to start a club.</p>
<p>In 2009 Ghanem founded Ottawa&rsquo;s Mixed Couples Club. The first meeting was held at an Iranian restaurant  &mdash;  a good location, he says, because the food isn&rsquo;t too spicy for the better halves who can&rsquo;t handle heat. About 20 couples attended the first gathering and each one shared the story of how they met.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more mixing we have, the more we realize we&rsquo;re all equal,&#8221; Ghanem says.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you sleep with the enemy, then how can that person be your enemy?&#8221;<br>

								<h2>More Canadians in Mixed Unions, Statscan Says</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jill Mahoney, Globe and Mail (Toronto), April 20, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>More Canadians are in inter-racial relationships, according to a new Statistics Canada report.</p>
<p>Canada had 289,400 mixed couples in 2006, up one-third from 2001. However, inter-racial partnerships still account for a small number of overall unions, at 3.9 per cent of couples in 2006, up from 3.1 per cent in 2001 and 2.6 per cent in 1991.</p>
<p>&#8220;The impact of mixed unions could be far-reaching in changing the dynamic and nature of Canada&rsquo;s ethnocultural diversity in future generations,&#8221; Statscan said in a report released Tuesday.</p>
<p>As the country becomes increasingly diverse, the number of inter-racial marriages and common-law unions will continue to climb. Many believe the growing trend is evidence that multiculturalism is working in Canada because mixed unions  &mdash;  and biracial children  &mdash;  break down barriers on perhaps the most personal of levels.</p>
<p>Intermarriage is more far common among visible minorities born in Canada than those born elsewhere. Fifty-one per cent of second-generation Canadians (the children of immigrants) who identified as visible minorities were in a mixed union, compared to 12 per cent of immigrants. The rate was even higher among third-generation visible minorities, of whom 69 per cent were in racially mixed relationships.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada defines mixed unions as a couple comprised of either one visible minority and one non-minority or two members of different visible minority groups. Eighty-five per cent of mixed relationships were comprised of a visible minority and a non-minority.</p>
<p>Statscan said people in mixed unions were more likely to live in urban areas. In 2006, 5.1 per cent of all couples in cities were in inter-racial relationships, compared with 1.4 per cent of couples elsewhere. Vancouver had the highest proportion among metropolitan areas, with 8.5 per cent of couples in mixed relationships.</p>
<p>Mixed couples tend to be younger and have children living at home. As well, they are more likely to be highly educated  &mdash;  more than one in three people in mixed partnerships had a university degree, compared to one in five people in non-mixed couples.</p>
<p>The national statistics agency said Japanese were most likely to form relationships outside their ethnic group. About 75 per cent of the 29,700 couples in which at least one person was Japanese involved a pairing with a non-Japanese person, Statscan said. They were followed by Latin Americans and blacks.<br>

		<p>Since the early 60s when some universities, I can think of Ann Arbor in Michigan in particular, made rules aimed at bringing blacks, and black men in particular onto the campus, to the dismay of many a middle-class parent.  &#8220;Tut, tut,&#8221; said the faculty,.. &#8220;mustn&rsquo;t be discriminatory.&#8221;  This allowed a completely underserving pimp self-named Malcom X, a place on campus.  He turned white female students prostitutes into prostitutes and pimped them on weekends in Detroit. Closet leftists on campus saw it as their chance to sow chaos in America and they have done it well.  We have been abused until all but a few who post on sites like Amren are numb, only afraid to be called &#8220;RACIST.&#8221;  Now, most whites seem to be numb to everything that violates pride, identity, and our race, while others revile in their identies, cultures and races.  But numbness is actually only a means of suspending or overlaying symptoms.  The disease eventually manifests and destroys its host.  The question is, can the parasites live on without us?</p>

		<p>even so called conservatives are now advocating this as the  &#8216;final solution&rsquo; to the &#8216;problem&rsquo; of racism. the elite&rsquo;s mo is create a problem, then adovcate more the problem as the solution. </p>
<p>It may sound outrageous now but i can can easily see white marriages being either illegal or highly penalized in the near future- for example, if you have a mixed race kid now the economic benefits are much greater- they qualify for affirmative action in key, expensive areas like education.. </p>

You hit the nail on the head!  This is coming next Whitey! This has all been PLANNED by our enemy. Why else do you think there was the civil &#8220;rights&#8221; movement and integration? Why else was there the 65 immigration act? Why else is there the brainwashing of the White masses to cohabitate with nonwhites? </p>
<p>Just look at our young screaming and applauding the nonwhite &#8220;stars&#8221; and even pushing country music now to put more blacks in their ranks. Never thought I would EVER see our country music stars so accepting of this blatant takeover. Watched the country music awards shows lately and the &#8220;new country&#8221;?</p>
<p> Keep them White girls screaming for the black man&hellip;&hellip;how far have we sunk? </p>

<p>Ever-increasing rates of mixed marriage are inevitable given the ethnic makeup of Canada&rsquo;s current immigrants. </p>
<p>Consider: Canada has the world&rsquo;s highest immigration intake by population size: every year, the Canadian population grows by almost 1% (counting only the <i>legal</i> immigration that the govt is aware of and admits to). </p>
<p>And 90% of those immigrants are nonwhite. </p>
<p>Meaning that with each passing year, young white Canadians of marrying age will find fewer and fewer possible partners from which to choose. In the big, immigrant-heavy cities like Toronto, young white men and women may soon find the pickin&rsquo;s so slim on the white dating-and-mating scene, that they start looking outside their group. Not because a mixed-race relationship is necessarily what they want, but because it&rsquo;s all they can get. Women, in particular, being more marriage-minded than men, will probably succumb to this thinking just so&rsquo;s not to end up alone, i.e. what she really wants is a white husband, but if forced she&rsquo;ll settle for the &#8220;reasonable facsimile&#8221; of a brown husband&hellip; or a yellow husband&hellip; or maybe even the UN-reasonable facsimile of a black husband. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Great White North&#8221;? Maybe for another 20 or 30 years. After that it&rsquo;ll be less the color of snow than the color of slush. </p>

		<p>To 9 Legal Eagle&hellip;excellent post&hellip;yeah, I wonder how long it will take for the phrase &#8220;sidelong look&#8221; to be replaced by the phrase, &#8220;hate look.&#8221;</p>
<p>And depending on which way things go, I could even imagine &#8220;hate looks&#8221; becoming prosecutable crimes, since they can cause mental suffering.</p>
<p>It sounds crazy, but who would have ever dreamed in 1950 that things could get as weird as they are already.</p>

<p>The trend of mistakenly blaming women goes on. Saying that women are more &#8220;marriage-minded&#8221; conveniently allows you to sidestep the FACT that White men race-mix far more often than White women. I know you don&rsquo;t want to face the reality that your gender is the greater contributor to what you describe as &#8220;White&#8221; turning to &#8220;slush&#8221;, but it&rsquo;s statistically true.   <br>

<p>Smells (no pun intended) like a fake hate crime to me, probably done by the &#8220;victims&#8221; themselves, for sympathy. It would be interesting to track this story and see what really happened. They say two men were charged&hellip;maybe they were paid by the unfortunate &#8220;victims&#8221; to perpetrate a hoax.</p>
<p>On a related note, I play games at a certain website. They are running ads now for a dating site (the first letter being &#8220;e&#8221;&hellip;you can guess the rest), and featured in their ad is a decent looking young white guy along with a rather ugly (in my opinion) black woman. This is from a site that used to take critism for not allowing mixed race matches. All I can say is &#8220;ugh&#8221;.</p>

		<p>As the proportion of the white population decreases, the racial consciousness of whites is more and more likely to resurface.  The only question is whether or not it will return too late to be of any use.  We shouldn&rsquo;t be taking that chance.  Hope for the best, plan for the worst.</p>
<p>85% of 289,400 is 245,990.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bad.  The evilest &#8220;racists&#8221; amongst us American whites really need to find a nice area and form a town, and then start breeding exponentially and making sure our kids stay within the church, so to speak.  People who argue for quality against quantity need to be reminded that you get both when two whites make babies, IQ is largely hereditary folks.  To those who say it would take too long to reach the necessary numbers - <br>

<p>Your post is somewhat misleading. As someone who lived in Canada for four years as a graduate student, the fact is that there are still a large enough number of young White canadians that if  they were interested in dating or marrying one another, they would be able to do so. Canada is still predominately White even in metropolitian areas like Montreal and Toronto.</p>
<p>The fact is that many of them have chosen, yes chosen (no one has forced them) to date and marry outside their race. You see the same sad behavior happening here in the US. </p>
<p>Again, many these young Whites (and non-Whites)are engaging in this sort of behavior out of choice.   </p>

		<p>Michael thank you for yor post. I am so fed up hearing some of our fellow Amereners always making ridiculous excuses that Whites are being&#8221;forced&#8221; to date, have sex and marry non-Whites.</p>
<p>There is a strong level of free will taking place. It may be easier to throw out such bogus arguments such as government  sponsored propaganda, indoctrination etc&hellip; The fact is that many of our fellow Whites have willingly decided to engage in the miscegenation game.</p>

		<p>I brought my children up to know to stay in their own race when they marry.  My daughter, her husband and I got into a discussion about who their daughter, a fair haired beauty, might marry.  They decided it would be up to her, how she chose her mate, and race wouldn&rsquo;t matter.  No, I told them, it is up to the parent to teach the child that race mixing is not acceptable.  My college educated daughter gave me a funny look, she calls me racist all the time.  Education has ruined the next generation.</p>
