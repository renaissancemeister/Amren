			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News Blog, CNN, April 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The radical Islamic Web site Revolutionmuslim.com is going after the creators of the TV cartoon series &#8220;South Park&#8221; after an episode last week included an image of the Prophet Mohammed in disguise.</p>
<p>Revolutionmuslim.com, based in New York, was the subject of a CNN investigation last year for its radical rhetoric supporting &#8220;jihad&#8221; against the West and praising al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. {snip}</p>
<p>On Sunday, Revolutionmuslim.com posted an entry that included a warning to South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone that they risk violent retribution  &mdash;  after the 200th episode last week included a satirical discussion about whether an image of the prophet could be shown. In the end, he is portrayed disguised in a bear suit.</p>
<p>The posting on Revolutionmuslim.com says: &#8220;We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show. This is not a threat, but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The entry on Revolutionmuslim.com goes on to advise readers:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can contact them [the makers of South Park], or pay Comedy Central or their own company a visit at these addresses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; before listing Comedy Central&rsquo;s New York address, and the Los Angeles, California, address of Parker and Sloane&rsquo;s production company.</p>
<p>Contacted by CNN, the author of the post, Abu Talhah al Amrikee, said that providing the addresses was not intended as a threat to the creators of South Park but to give people the opportunity to protest.</p>
<p>Over still photographs of Parker, Stone, van Gogh and others, the Web site runs audio of a sermon by the radical U.S.-born preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who is now in hiding in Yemen. The sermon, recorded some time ago, talks about assassinating those who have &#8220;defamed&#8221; the Prophet Mohammed {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Al Amrikee said the purpose of including the al-Awlaki sermon in his posting was to remind Muslims that insulting the prophet is a severe offense for which the punishment in Islam is death. He said RevolutionMuslim may hold protests about the show.</p>

		<p>The best part about this is they actually showed Muhammad in a 2001 episode and no one cared.  Muslims are acting like children about this stuff.  Trust me,the guys at South Park won&rsquo;t be intimidated by these veiled threats; It will only provoke them.</p>
<p>Regardless of your opinion of this show; you have to respect their unwaving commitment to free speech.   </p>

		<p>Threats against those who &#8220;disrespect&#8221; Mohammed are one method of Da&rsquo;wah, or proselytization to convert to Islam.  Non-Muslims who censor themselves in fear of offending Muslims are unknowingly participating in the religion of Islam.  <br>
Jesus Christ, the Prophets and God Himself have been caricatured by non-Christians but we Christians do not issue threats because non-believers are not required to follow the precepts of our religion.  We know that God is in control.<br>
There are too many threats being issued by Muslims and it must be stopped.  Those who threaten the lives of others, and this was a threat, must be tracked down and prosecuted. At the least,  they must be stripped of their legal residence or citizenship status and deported.  </p>

		<p>Personally, I usually enjoy South Park.  It is NOT for kids - it is an extremely ribald satirical show that deals with current events.  Every year on Dec. 1, my best friend and I play the &#8220;Mr. Hanky, the Christmas Poo&#8221; episode to officially open the holidays for us.  However, in the matter at hand, the Muslims show their usual inarticulate and immature inability to laugh at themselves.  They are trying to force a 7th century, male-dominated system of sanctified slavery (religion) on a 21st century equality-based country - the USA.  I personally feel that both Trey and Matt should both automatically be issued permits to carry a gun; after all, one or both of them is Jewish, and this is simply the Muslims&rsquo; base attempt at an excuse to kill Jews.  Why this country even allows Muslims to exist here is beyond me; their whole ambition is to destroy this country, take it over, and impose Shariah law on everyone who&rsquo;s left. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of these guys Matt Stone and Trey Parker. <br>
I wasn&rsquo;t at first when South Park first came out, as my first impression was that their humour was just puerile and too toilet orientated.<br>
Which it still is, but I started to appreciate how refreshingly politically incorrect their subject matter is, how topical they can be via their ability to produce their shows really quickly and how anti Hollywood and anti actors (especially) they are, this being the reason for them preferring to work in animation and with puppets (they say most animators are failed aspiring actors).</p>
<p>E.g. Here&rsquo;s them attending the 2000 academy awards after being nominated for best musical song or score (or similar) wearing replicas of dresses wore by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez at an earlier Oscars ceremony. <br>
https://tinyurl.com/y8lynrc (image)<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/26hvjrq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/26hvjrq</a> (video)<br>
Granted they are pretty &#8216;out there&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen them interviewed and asked &#8220;how do you get away with being so politically incorrect?&#8221; and they responded by saying it&rsquo;s because they deliberately set out to offend everybody.<br>
Some people and groups can take it, others like the fundamentalist Muslims and Tom Cruise obviously can not.<br>
Cruise threatened Viacom exes that if the comedy channel didn&rsquo;t pull the &#8216;in the closet&rsquo; S.P. episode that he wouldn&rsquo;t do any promotion work for M.I. 2 (or 3?), this just gave the episode a &#8216;cult&rsquo; status on line, and did nothing to quell the rumours suggested with in the episode.</p>
<p>The fundamentalist Muslims sure do spend a lot of time looking at Western cartoons and comedians, although Theo Van Gogh was neither of course, but the descendant of a nationally iconic figure.<br>
It&rsquo;s hard to take these types of Muslims seriously with their paper thin skin, meaning they get offended by &#8216;Allah in a bear suit&rsquo;? But when they instigate violence, threats and such vocal protests, we have to.</p>
<p>They have a cheek though, dictating their closed minded, medieval value in our &lsquo;free&rsquo; countries, debate is Ok but the rest they can keep in their countries.</p>
<p>I wonder what they think of&hellip;<br>

Personally I enjoy the freedom to think it&rsquo;s funny and I have the intelligence to determine that it&rsquo;s just satire and not real.<br>

<p>NO, it is a threat and a very serious one. It is a threat of the first magnitude by persons who mean business. Almost as if soliciting murder. These two producers have done a dumb thing and think they are being cute. They very well might end up regretting what they have done for the REST OF THEIR LIVES! Going into hiding, living in a safe house in a vault, etc.</p>

		<p>The US government and law officials need to stop this TERRORIST activity, before the people decide to take the law into their own hands.<br>
Why do we even allow muslim extremists/Jihadist into our great nation, after all, Osama himself vowed to &#8220;&hellip;not rest until his flag flew over the White House&#8221;. Maybe we should take the sick S.O.B at his word? The last time we ignored him, was 9/11.</p>

		<p>Another instance of typical Muslim behavior that is redolent of the mannerism displayed by a bunch of rabid baboons in a zoo.<br>
The funny thing is that there is another, older South Park episode where Muslims take offence because the Prophet Muhammad is shown in a cartoon. For fear of violent retributions, the South Park residents pile up sand heaps on main street and stick their heads in like ostriches to express their solidarity with the Muslims, maybe some of you remember that installment. How strange that Muslims, while constantly insisting that Islam means peace (it actually translates as submission)incessantly prove that all stereotypes concerning their irrational and innately violent demeanor are in fact fully applicable. Whatsoever you certainly cannot blame them for stiving to follow in their Holy Prophet`s footsteps and pursuing the high standards of civilization that he set, just sneak a glimpse at the &#8220;sand dune paradises&#8221; in the Arab World, countries where people enjoy all the liberties you could think of. To most Muslims it is just mind-boggling that Westerners refuse to acknowledge the superiority of Arab civilization. &#8220;irony off&#8221;</p>

<p>WHAT?!</p>
<p>I have been warning people about Islam ever since I came back from Turkey, but I did not know this! I wish some liberals would talk seriously with Muslims about the future of the country. They general proudly and confidently proclaim that America will become a Muslim country. </p>

		<p>One wonders just how long this country is going to countenance threating behavior from Muslims.  While Christendom committed its share of atrocities, to include widely celebrated stake-burnings and assorted grisly tortures, this was a long time ago. </p>
<p>Islam never got out of the 11th Century.  Its precepts and beliefs, particularly its lethal intolerance toward &#8220;infidels,&#8221; has no place in the modern world. Threats toward people seen by Muslims to be defaming Islam, for any reason and in whatever form, should be punished swiftly and as brutally as need be to make the point.</p>

		<p>The statement made isn&rsquo;t actually a threat; it is indeed a warning. What it suggests is not that Revolution Muslim will kill them but that other extremists will. It&rsquo;s a fair warning but will almost certainly fall on deaf ears. The essence of South Park is it&rsquo;s unabashed ridicule of everyone - Christians, Muslims, jews, atheists, liberals, conservatives, cops, parents, and Jesus himself. </p>
<p>Muslims need to get over themselves and choose their battles. </p>
