			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AOL News, April 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A homeless man who was stabbed while saving a woman from a knife-wielding attacker lay dying in a pool of his own blood for more than an hour while several New Yorkers walked past without calling for help.</p>
<p>Surveillance video obtained by the New York Post shows that some passers-by paused to gawk at Hugo Alfredo Tale-Yax early Sunday morning and yet kept on walking.</p>
<p>One man came out of a nearby building and took a cellphone photo of the victim before leaving. Another leaned over and vigorously shook the dead man before walking away. But most people never stopped.</p>
<p>Firefighters arrived more than an hour and 20 minutes after Tale-Yax collapsed. By that time, the 31-year-old was dead.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tale-Yax is seen on the grainy video approaching a man who was threatening a woman with a knife. The man turned and stabbed Tale-Yax but most of the action is out of the security camera&rsquo;s field of vision. Both the stabber and the woman then fled in different directions and Tale-Yax stumbled a few paces before collapsing face-down on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No arrests have been made in the latest slaying, and police have been unable to identify the woman Tale-Yax was trying to help.</p>

		<p>I saw the video on Fox this evening and all the passersby appeared to be black. Gee what a surprise.<br>
The City government of Chicago is contemplating calling in the Illonois National Guard to patrol the streets. Evidently the Chicago PD is overwhelmed by the crime,<br>
Is anyone shocked?</p>

		<p>An extended version of the same video was shown here in New York City. There were several White people who walked by without doing anything as well. I am not surprised by non-Whites, but for Whites to behave this indifferent and callously, it is incomprehensible to me.</p>

		<p>This is a terrible thing, and yet I can sort of understand why the NY&rsquo;ers didn&rsquo;t respond.  For one thing, most did not witness the incident, and did not know if the victim had a weapon or not.  Secondly, if you call the police on a cell phone, they can come to you and question you like you were the criminal instead of the jerk who got away, and most people don&rsquo;t want that.  Third, most probably assumed that the police were already on their way and so there was no need to call.  These are not great reasons for failure to help, but they are realistic, and to me at least a little bit understandable.</p>

		<p>To poster #3.  I live in NYC.  What passes for &#8216;white&rsquo; here is appalling.  There are very, very few Anglo-Saxon/Germanic/British/French/Scandanavian whites in this city (the original builders of America).</p>
<p>Most so-called whites are trashy Italians who are only 2nd or 3rd generation, or eastern European Euro-trash or Jews who are not really caucasian but semitic.  Here, Turks, Armenians, Iranians, Albanians and a hundred others are considered the &#8216;white&rsquo; people.  </p>
<p>These newcomers do not have old-fashioned American values and never will because traditional America has retreated so far out of the cities that a &#8216;new&rsquo; &#8216;diverse&rsquo; culture has formed in the cities.  Hedonistic, immoral, self-centered, racially-conscious, sense of grievance/entitlement.  Welcome to the new AmeriKa.</p>

		<p>#4 is no doubt correct.  Also, how many people assumed the victim was just a drunken  &mdash;  or even simply sleeping  &mdash;  bum?  In today&rsquo;s society, people put themselves in great physical and legal jeopardy by getting involved with accidents and crimes.  Many safety books will instruct people to call 911 and do no more.  And the fact that it took rescuers so long to arrive demonstrates that the city is overburdened.</p>

		<p>As someone who travels frequently to San Francisco and Berkeley, there are MANY such homeless people lying prone on the streets who appear dead.</p>
<p>And from HBomb:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;if you call the police on a cell phone, they can come to you and question you like you were the criminal instead of the jerk who got away, and most people don&rsquo;t want that&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding.  I saw a pack of young black males hanging out in my neighborhood a few months back, called the police and got the grilling of my life.  </p>
<p>The female that took my call immediately asked for my driver&rsquo;s license and address which I refused to give.  I was then asked why I was suspicious and what I thought they were going to do.  I told her I was looking at a Neighborhood Watch sign as I was speaking to her that said to &#8216;report suspicious activity&rsquo; and what was the point of having Neighborhood Watch is I were going to be hassled.  </p>
<p>I was in the car, calling on my cell phone (illegal in California), it was after dark and didn&rsquo;t have time for games  &mdash;  If I&rsquo;d been home I would have demanded her badge # and reported her to the Chief, which I should have done anyway.</p>
<p>Next time, I&rsquo;ll go knock on the door of my Armenian neighbors and let them know.<br>
You can bet those blacks will never appear in our neighborhood again and the police will not be involved.</p>

<p>As for the &#8220;eastern European Euro-trash&#8221; [sic]?  I&rsquo;ve traveled numerous times through the Polish sections of Brooklyn, and by and large they remained much more faithful to their ethnic and religious roots than those whom you extol.</p>

		<p>  Alas, this reminds me of the Kitty Genovese affair years ago. Bloomberg is no Giuliani and I see New York reverting over time to the awful crime rate of the Dinkins era. Rich whites can still live in Manhattan but the middle and blue collar folks have been driven out. I support the New York Italian-Americans because they are one of the few white groups actively resisting the Third Worldification of the city. </p>

____________________</p>
<p>This, being New York City, everyone is suspicious. That&rsquo;s what comes of living in a multicultural cosmopolis where there is NO SENSE OF COMMUNITY and everyone distrusts everyone else.</p>
<p>I once came across a young man (probably drunk or a junkie) who was lying in the curb, at a bus stop, where a bus would have come in and run him over.  He was faintly struggling to get up. I leaned down and offered him a hand.   He swatted my hand away and cursed me out with some choice obscenities.  I told him, &#8220;Very well. Lie there and get squashed, for all I care!&#8221;   &mdash;    And  I walked away.</p>
<p>He probably assumed I was going  to rob him.  Well, after all, this is New York City! What else would he expect?</p>

<p>So were the Irish, another group much maligned by the WASPs who were so wrapped in their own nobility and too proper to raise their voices when the anti-Westerners came in and began to deconstruct the US. I believe that &#8220;Jay&#8221; is most likely part of the bolshevik crew and posted his ridiculous remarks in an attempt to stir up some infighting.

		<p>voter: &#8220;Who was the person who just posted here last week about NY City being the safest city in the world  &mdash;  thanks to the miraculous reforms of Rudy Guilani?&#8221;</p>
<p>The poster who said that last week was obviously a good deal off-base.  However, I would like someone to riddle me this: Which large US city is in fact safer than NYC?? I will tell you what Wikipedia says (https://tinyurl.com/jbmaa).  Out of the ten largest U.S. cities, only San Diego has a lower murder rate than New York (and SDs rape rate is almost 3 times NYs, and ranks worse in many crime categories).  These are statistics from 2008, so one can only surmise that the situation has worsened in SD due to the illegal invasion.  When looked at in comparison with all other U.S. cities, it is easy to see that NYC does a pretty darn good job at keeping its streets somewhat respectable in this multicultural monster of a country.</p>
<p><br>
On a side note, I find it funny when people use one isolated incident, in this case one murder, to make broad generalizations about a city&rsquo;s safety.  Gives me the chuckles.  </p>

		<p>Jay is right even though many posters here think otherwise. Maybe you should re-read it. Look at who is considered &#8220;White&#8221; nowadays and who are not. Most are mixed.</p>

<p>New York City is an immigrant enclave   &mdash;   but a successful one, at that.  I have extended family in Ridgewood   &mdash;    a Polish neighborhood that is surprisingly clean and safe, despite stradding the border of Brooklyn and Queens. </p>

		<p>As a female, I can&rsquo;t stress how careful women have to be these days about helping anyone. I am suspicious even during the day if I am alone in the car in the middle of a store parking lot, and a male (even an old white one), appears to be getting too close to it (my car while I am in it). My soft heart goes out to so many people I see constantly but unfortunately America in 2010 isn&rsquo;t anything like the Andy Griffith show.  </p>
<p>I am even unsure of helping women who sit on the side of the road with signs.  How do I know they don&rsquo;t have a gang of men waiting in the woods behind them?  Women are involved in this manner in many crimes against women, you know.  </p>
<p>Goodness gracious.  We can&rsquo;t even open our doors at night if we hear a baby crying on the front step!  Believe it or not but killers use recordings of babies crying in order to kidnap women from their homes.</p>
<p>This is why I am so anti-feminist and I respect men as much as I do.  I respect men who go into law enforcement and in the military.  I respect my father, brother, boyfriend&hellip;etc&hellip;who would want to stick up for me in such a dangerous situation.  We need men around for these reasons, and this is why I think feminist attitudes are bad for the white race.</p>
<p>I have an incredibly soft heart, just like most women, but unfortunately our soft hearts as females can kill us too, especially in today&rsquo;s world.  But I agree, at least somebody, even a single woman, could have called 911.  I also agree that this sort of irresponsibility is much more typical in minority areas.  Pull out your cell phones, people!</p>

		<p>On a trip to NYC with my wife (we are from CA)we saw a lady get hit by a van. The van ran over her foot. She was laying in the street in the pouring rain and nobody did anything but stand around and stare from under unbrellas. My wife ran over and put our umbrella over this poor lady and made sure someone had  called 911. She then talked to the lady to calm her down and find out where she worked. She called her boss and explained what happened to her. He called back later to thank her and said nobody in NYC would have ever done this. It is a sad state of affairs when we don&rsquo;t help one another.</p>
