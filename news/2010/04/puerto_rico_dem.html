<h1><a href="https://blog.heritage.org/2010/04/27/puerto-rico-democracy-act-%e2%80%93-legislation-biased-in-favor-of-statehood/">Puerto Rico Democracy Act  &mdash;  Legislation Biased in Favor of Statehood</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Darling, Heritage Foundation, April 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the House will vote on H.R. 2499, the Puerto Rico Democracy Act, later this week. The legislation provides Puerto Rico a two stage voting process and makes some non-resident Puerto Ricans eligible to vote on Puerto Rican statehood. This legislation has rigged the process in favor of making Puerto Rico the 51st state and is not a fair way to force statehood on a Commonwealth whose people may not want it. Furthermore, this may be an expensive proposition for the American people who are already on the hook for approximately $12.9 trillion in national debt.</p>
<p>This bill attempts to rig the voting process and denies the American people a real say on the issue of whether they want to allow Puerto Rico to be granted statehood. The fact of the matter is that Puerto Ricans have rejected statehood numerous times and this bill seems to have been written in a way to fast track statehood without a majority of Puerto Ricans favoring the idea. Furthermore, the people of the United States should be allowed a vote on whether they want to admit Puerto Rico as a new state. If the people of Puerto Rico can vote, the people of the United States should have a vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clearly, a plurality of the people of Puerto Rico could vote for &#8220;Statehood&#8221; without a majority of the people voting ever supporting the idea. The people of Puerto Rico have rejected statehood three times and it seems that this vote is set up to allow a simply plurality of the people to carry the day.</p>
<p>Another odd provision allows non-resident Puerto Ricans to vote on statehood for the Commonwealth. {snip} Residency requirements may be waived, because Puerto Ricans living in the states would naturally favor statehood for the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>This provision allows non-resident Puerto Ricans to undermine the will of the residents of the Commonwealth. According to the U.S. Census, there are more Puerto Ricans residing in the 50 states, than in the proposed 51st state. {snip}</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) put out a report dated July 28, 2009 on H.R. 2499. The CBO report estimated that there would be no score for this bill, because it only authorizes a vote, but if Puerto Rico was granted statehood the cost would be massive. My boss, Edwin Feulner wrote in 1997 piece titled Do We Need a 51st State? &#8220;in an era of government downsizing and balanced budgets, it would increase entitlement spending (welfare, Medicare, Social Security) by an estimated $3 billion per year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} A vote by members of Congress is not enough to indicate consent of the American people for Puerto Rican statehood. {snip}</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just a way to get more Democrats elected.  PR would have 2 Democrat U.S. Senators and 5 or 6 Democrat Congressman in perpetuity.  Since the House is stuck at 435 members, those 5 or 6 that PR would get would have to come from other states, probably 4 or 5 out of those 5 or 6 would be reliably Republican districts.</p>
<p>Best thing to do is to grant PR independence.</p>

		<p>I understand that white Democrat politicians promote this to gain more votes, but I have a very hard time figuring out what goes through the heads of the many white average joe VOTERS on the streets who celebrate this sort of thing.  Are white liberal Democrat voters just flat out stupid?  Why do they enjoy putting down my people (white Southerners, &#8220;red necks&#8221; etc&hellip;), but they have absolutely no problem with Third World immigrants?  </p>
<p>I work with liberal white Democrat voters and they are by far the most clueless people I have ever been around.  They enjoy sitting around talking about how stupid white Southerners are, as well as country people, and how violent we are, but yet Third World people, to them, are perfectly civilized.  </p>
<p>I despise white liberals more and more.  Get me back to my home in Alabama now, and get me away from this blue state up North I currently work in!</p>

		<p>I think you are right QV- it is a way to try to pack congress and the senate with Democrats. When they were going to give DC a representative they were going to give us here in Utah a third rep so that the Democratic Rep in DC would be balanced with a Republican Rep in Utah. I don&rsquo;t know how a PR statehood would work out anyway- as to granting them independence most of them do not want it. PR is happy with the Federal money thrown at them and all of the benefits, they generally think that they could not make it without the US behind them. </p>

		<p>Fiscally as a 51st state PR would amount to something along the lines of the poorest 25th percentile counties of Mississippi, New Mexico, and West Virginia combined. Socially and culturally it would be about like the Dominican Republic pre-conditioned to US welfare programs. Ideologically, it would behave a lot like Cuba.</p>

		<p>If the Democrats dont suceed in destroying the demographics of the USA by legalizing 30 million Mexicans&hellip;then the next best thing is Puerto Rico..a permanent welfare state that will always vote left.</p>

		<p>As of now, the Puerto Ricans qualify for Federal welfare, but pay no Fed. Income Tax and cannot vote in Federal elections.<br>
If they opt for statehood, since most of them are on some form <br>
of welfare, most of them will be voting for Obama and for Demcratic reps.  That&rsquo;s what is behind this:  GArnering more votes for Obama to help get him re-elected in 2011.<br>
They&rsquo;ve always opted to retain the status quo before; I believe they will do the same when it comes to a vote again.</p>

		<p>You guys know that I am no bleeding heart liberal; however the American public has no right whatsoever to grant statehood,independence or commonwealth status on the Puerto Ricans. Wilson had them made citizens, not for any democratic notions of fair play, but so he could draft them. He did about 25,000,of which 5000 lie somewhere this side of the Marne. Ever since Puerto Rico has watered the world with it`s sons from Normandy to Kandahar.They have paid for what ever they want to do with the dearest currency. Anyway I`d trade all the Yankees ever born for a squad of Puerto Rican infantry any time.<br>

		<p>Precisely what we need another welfare state, the last time I was in Puerto Rico I was in the military and we were warned to stay out of certain areas because of probable violence. Passing through town in busses we were cursed, and recieved the famous one finger wave. The walls in the city were lined with graffiti with such friendly slogans as Yankee pigs go home, all in all a pleasant visit to this place. The people were living in total poverty. Children were eating from the garbage, while shooing the flys, and stealing even our toilet paper. By the way how could this be our 51st state when our genius leader has stated he has already been to 57 states. This from the idiot who is organizing our COMMUNITY.</p>

		<p>Puerto Ricans are no better than any of the other nonwhites we have in this country. They are a drain and a liability to White America. Remember that anti-White racist Geraldo? Don&rsquo;t forget about all their violence in the States also.</p>

		<p>The lyrics to the song &ldquo;Gee, Officer Krupke&rdquo; from the movie &ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo; accurately depict the character of Puerto Ricans who were born and raised in New York city.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The Puerto Ricans born and raised in Puerto Rico are much worse&hellip;&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had numerous Puerto Ricans, in Puerto Rico, tell me this. They are leery of &#8220;Puerto Ricans&#8221; (Newyoricans) who have been raised in the US and returned there. These &#8220;big city&#8221; Puerto Ricans bring back bad habits and attitudes that aren&rsquo;t native to the island. I&rsquo;ve also had those &#8220;big city&#8221; Puerto Ricans tell me how contemptuous they are of the islanders, who seem to them like &#8220;hicks&#8221;. </p>
<p>Let me say, though, that there are all kinds, types, and shades of Puerto Ricans   &mdash;   just as Americans. There are white ones, black ones, and all sorts of mixtures in between. Also good ones and bad ones;  nor is the division necessarily racial (although it frequently is).</p>
<p>Having lived for many years in New York, over the course of that time I have (inevitably) known a great many Puerto Ricans.  Even after all that time, I&rsquo;m completely unable to lump them all together into the same pot.  I&rsquo;ve known some lovely Puerto Ricans &hellip; and some terrible ones. And all kinds in between. There just isn&rsquo;t any one single type that can describe them.</p>
