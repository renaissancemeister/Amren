<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police at UCLA are warning female students to be extra vigilant after a man tried to rape a woman on campus when she was making a cellphone call outside a residence hall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The attempted rape occurred about 3:30 a.m. Wednesday when a female student outside the Covel Commons building was grabbed and taken to a more isolated location, the university police department said. The attacker then threw the woman to the ground and straddled her, UCLA police said.</p>
<p>For some reason, the attacker stopped the assault and walked away. {snip}</p>
<p>The suspect is described as Latino, 20 to 30 years old, and unshaven. {snip}</p>
<p>On March 26, a sexual battery occurred at Westwood Plaza and Young Drive South about 6:25 p.m. when a female student reported a man grabbed her crotch.</p>
<p>{snip}. The suspect in that attack was described as a 40- to 50-year-old Latino, 5-feet-5 to 5-feet-6 in height.</p>
<p>On March 5, another woman affiliated with the university was knocked to the ground on Hilgard Avenue in an attempted sexual assault. The suspect was described as an Asian man about 25 years old {snip}.<br>

								<h2><a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N16/rape.html">Assault in Building 2: Man Arrested for Rape on Tuesday</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>John A. Hawkinson, The Tech (MIT), April 2, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A man was arrested early Tuesday morning on campus and charged with rape and trespassing.</p>
<p>Around 2:20 a.m. Tuesday morning, the MIT Police received a report of a sexual assault on the first floor of Building 2, most likely in a classroom. Police responded and assisted the victim with medical attention, and cordoned off the scene.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Violent crime on MIT&rsquo;s campus is extremely rare. Excluding incidents involving on-campus parties, there have been no comparable incidents within the past two decades.</p>
<p>By 4 a.m., MIT Police had arrested Jason Reed, who was found on campus and in the vicinity of the crime scene.</p>
<p>Reed, age 30, is homeless and was arrested on the charge of trespassing. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In January of this year, Reed was arrested and subsequently convicted of assault and battery. He hit a woman in the head several times behind 110 Newbury St., apparently after having sex with her, according to a Boston Police report.</p>
<p>The January victim, Shereen Westdahl, age 46, was hospitalized, but was then released and died shortly thereafter, according to the case file.</p>
<p>Since his incarceration in January, and until his release on or around March 16, Reed has not had access to his medication, his lawyer&rsquo;s statement said.</p>

Alcohol, plus late hours equals trouble in the making. I would also like to thank my 24 hour Quickie Mart cashier for finally breaking me of the habit of buying coffee at the store early in the morning.

		<p>This is really one of the things that make me very angry! Such non-White bums are going after our women, and if we say anything about it, we&rsquo;ll possibly be given a lecture about the social inequalities that cause some color people to commit crimes, etc, etc.</p>

		<p>I think that any male of ANY race who assaults/rapes a woman is just a sick coward.  However, these types of people do not get rehabilitated; we put &#8216;em in the slammer for a few years and then they get out and do it again, only this time maybe with a murder just to round things out.  I say that first offenders should get a mandatory 20 years, no time off for good behavior; the second time they should get the death penalty; and first time child molesters should be relieved of their testes, because they very definitely don&rsquo;t ever change their ways.  Male animals that are &#8220;altered&#8221; are easier to handle and are a lot nicer to have around; I am certain it would be the same for human male animals.</p>

		<p>Rape by Latinos, particularly of White women and children&hellip; is a lot more prevalent than people realize. We&rsquo;ve had numerous stories like this in the local news over the years here in Houston. Of course the Mexican community is in denial&hellip; but crime reports do an excellent job of proving how many criminals are among the illegal immigrants&hellip; criminals in the other sense of the term.</p>

<p>And he was out on the street, ready to strike again. This isn&rsquo;t just about race, this is about the willingness of law enforcement to let serious crimes go unpunished. When the state fails to provide security and justice, citizens will provide those things, themselves. We&rsquo;ll become another Brazil&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just a freakin war zone out there - everywhere. Your worry used to be whether you made it to class on time. Now it&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;ll survive long enough to make it to class at all. LIfe is insane now in this country so &#8216;rich with diversity&rsquo;. Not to mention dangerous.</p>

		<p>Bldg. 2 is the MIT math building, gray and dingy and dreary, as was considered befitting for pure-math researchers who hole up in isolation on the upper floors.  It&rsquo;s also off the beaten path, one of the &#8220;crab claw&#8221; ends of the MIT corridor network.  Wonder how this guy (and the woman) found the place  &mdash;  and wonder if either of them had been there before, and why.</p>
<p>MIT Campus Police is pretty good at finding and expunging the various homeless that wind their way onto campus.  This case seems to have been an exception.   (MIT needs to have an open campus due to the large number of visitors  &mdash;  academic, corporate, and tourist  &mdash;  from all over the world, of nearly every color and nation; the working visitors may need lab access 24 hours/day particularly if facing a research deadline.)  </p>
<p>One solution would be if officialdom would give *students* more liberty to use the classroom spaces all night for legitimate purposes (project work, tutoring)  &mdash;  students could schedule a room from, say, 1AM to 3AM and it would be unlocked for only those hours.   The lights and voices would make &#8220;randoms&#8221; uncomfortable.  The students pull lots of all-nighters anyway&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The ptb want crimes like this.  They let the criminals on campus for that reason.  That is why they let them out of jail.</p>
<p>The judges and lawyers are making plenty of money suing the upper middle class whites who are too naive to suspect collusion.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Police at UCLA are warning female students to be extra vigilant after a man tried to rape a woman on campus when she was making a cellphone call outside a residence hall&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe there is a lot more crime that goes on at universities than the administrators (or lefties) will admit to the public  &mdash;  unfortunately, many universities seem to abut high-crime, non-White, Section 8 areas.</p>
<p>My beautiful 19-year old daughter attends a large UC stuck between two of the most vile ghettos in California:  Oakland and Richmond.</p>
<p>The first day I dropped her off in August, I noticed a very large poster on the front door of the dorm  &mdash;  on it were the words WANTED and photos of a number of black males  &mdash;  all of whom had committed crimes against young female UC students  &mdash;  purse snatchings, attempted rapes, assaults and armed robberies.</p>
<p>The WANTED poster was in full view for parents and students to see  &mdash;  and it wasn&rsquo;t just for show, the WANTED poster was still up in December and by March it was moved into the lobby but still in plain sight.</p>
<p>I was surprised.</p>
<p>Locals tell me blacks from Oakland come over to Berkeley, jump in and out of cars snatching unsuspecting students&rsquo; lap top computers, backpacks or anything else they can grab, preying on young naive Whites and Asians who don&rsquo;t want to appear &#8216;racist&rsquo; when an out-of-place black, obviously not a university student, appears in close proximity or walks behind them.</p>
<p>I have warned my daughter in no uncertain terms of the dangers blacks pose to her life  &mdash;  she used to roll her eyes at me and say &#8216;Oh, Mom&rsquo;  &mdash;  but no longer.  She is now wary of those around her and knows which areas and people to avoid.</p>
<p>God forbid I find myself in court facing down a depraved black murderer like Eve Carson&rsquo;s loved ones.</p>

		<p>  Too often young naive female college students take sociology classes that teach them that victims (i.e. minorities) can&rsquo;t be victimizers. These same students are also taught in Women&rsquo;s Studies to dislike and distrust the universal oppressors of all women &mdash; white males. They are totally unprepared when the black football player or Third World exchange student doesn&rsquo;t really have &ldquo;etchings&rdquo; to show them in his room.</p>

		<p>Bon, I am a man and I learned the hard way the threat blacks and non-whites in general are to the lives of all whites. I taught a couple of them a lesson too when they cornered me and I gave them a beat down after they attacked me in my own dorm room. I am so glad I do not have a daughter, because if a non-white harmed her, nothing will stop me from killing him with my bare hands in court short of the bailiffs shooting me. I have no racial guilt, and nothing but contempt for all non-whites, except for the ones who were raised to be decent people. A person raised to be a decent and moral person I have no problem with, whatever their origins, but more and more non-whites are being raised to be less than gangsters and thugs. Why should I as a Slav, whose people know what real slavery is?</p>

<p><br>
Yeah, the 46 year old woman was apparently &#8220;having sex&#8221;, not being raped by this man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reed was convicted on March 16 and <b>sentenced to three months of jail time,</b> which was deemed to have been served by the time he spent in jail awaiting sentencing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, three months!! </p>
<p>(that&rsquo;s still longer than what I have seen in Toronto.  In Toronto nowadays, you will not have to spend a minute in jail if you are a non-white who killed someone.</p>
<p>Two students from my school, one is from former Soviet Union and the other is an offspring between a black man and a Chinese woman, they killed a Pakistani cab driver and won&rsquo;t have to spend a second in jail.)</p>

<p>This has ben going on since the early forties when the Port of Oakland and the various military supply factories bought blacks in from the south.  I well remember an incident in the early 1970&rsquo;s.  The Berkely police actually pulled an Oakland black thug off a white student he was raping.  The Berkely chief of police had to go on television and apologize for this.</p>
<p>There was a period of about 15 years, maybe 1963 to 1977 when the Alameda county (Oakland) district attorney&rsquo;s office absolutely refused to prosecute any black on white rape because they knew they would lose.</p>
<p>The commie feminazis at Berkely absolutely refuse to admit that virtually all the rapes in Alameda and Contra Costa counties are committed by blacks.  The Berkely feminazis refused to admit the facts of black on white rape in 1950.  They are the same today.</p>
<p>For decades Berkely feminazis held to the To kill A Mockingbird theory that black men don&rsquo;t rape but White victims sexually assaulted the black rapists.  The Berkely feminazis also contacted the national Laywers guild, ACLU, ADL, NAACP etc offering &#8220;expert&#8221; testimony about White victims lust for black rapists so as to exonerate the black rapists.</p>
