<p>More Diverse Nation Fails to Value Diversity in Print and Online Newsrooms</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.  &mdash;  APRIL 13, 2010  &mdash;  Newsrooms cut black journalists and supervisors at a higher rate than ever before in 2009 while the minority communities they cover grow larger. As more African-American journalists lose their jobs, diversity in newsrooms has taken a back seat according to a study released Sunday by the American Society of News Editors (ASNE).</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a travesty that minority journalists would be targeted disproportionately in staff cuts,&#8221; said National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) President Kathy Y. Times. &#8220;Despite the economy we must keep our newsrooms and voices at least on parity with the communities we serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newsroom jobs held by black journalists were slashed by an unprecedented 19.2 percent in 2009, nearly six percentage points higher than the previous year. Since 2001, African-Americans have a net loss of more than 30 percent of the positions they occupied in American newsrooms.</p>
<p>The NABJ Board of Directors is scheduled to meet in the Washington, D.C.-area this weekend to discuss the recent ASNE findings and develop an action plan for improving newsroom hiring and retention of black journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a key goal in NABJ&rsquo;s mission and we will continue to search for new ways to highlight this gap until it is closed,&#8221; said Vice President-Print Deirdre M. Childress. &#8220;As the diversity of the American population increases, it is equally important for us to see that change reflected in American newsrooms so that stories can be told from all perspectives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of newspapers with no minorities on their staff rose to 465 last year, an increase of seven over 2008. Another disturbing finding in this year&rsquo;s study is the continued decline in black journalists in leadership positions.</p>
<p>Black journalists in supervisory roles dropped by 20.3 percent to just 428 individuals helping decide what is considered news in print and online newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s about accuracy,&#8221; ASNE Diversity Director Bobbi Bowman said of the objective of the census. &#8220;Can you accurately cover your community if you have a newsroom that doesn&rsquo;t look like your community?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bowman links the decline in newspaper circulation to the rise in the minority population over the last several years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Readers are very smart and readers know whether or not their newspaper is covering news that is important and relevant to them,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>General population trends show that births to minorities are on pace to overcome majority births this year, and that the minority population will be greater than 50 percent of the total U.S. population within three decades. Despite these population trends, news as determined and as covered by the majority continues to increasingly dominate online and print newspapers.</p>
<p>In 1999, ASNE defined as its goal to deliver parity in newsroom representation by 2025. NABJ stands ready to work with ASNE and media companies to reach this goal and promote diversity in the nation&rsquo;s newsrooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Communities are not of one color and neither should newsroom decision makers,&#8221; said President Times. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve made some tremendous gains over the years and NABJ is going to continue to be watchdogs while also seeking new opportunities for members to build their own brands through top-notch training and education.&#8221;<br>

		<p>What they do to bring &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to the newsroom is hire English speakers from overseas. The names on the byline invariably sound non-white. More than one poster has advised to change your child&rsquo;s name to a hispanic sounding one. The simplest and easiest thing to do to improve your employment prospects. Possibly, more relevant than anything else.  </p>

		<p>Even CNN has changed radically since Obama&rsquo;s election.  Except for a few hapless hangers on like the thoroughly neutered Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, and the walking corpse of Larry King, CNN is now set up to play the race card as a matter of course.  All its anchors are blacks, with that one Hispanic advocate, and they interpret the news with an unmistakable racial bias while they openly strategize against conservative politics.  Except for the pretty white women they use to complement black anchors like the morning anchor, who not only has to high five it with his white female reporters, but grasp hands and hold momentarily.  I actually witnessed what must have been the first time he did it, unplanned, it seemed.  The white women reporter seemed to not expect it.  The next time, the white women expected it and played along.  They all do it now.  He&rsquo;s got his CNN harem in place.  No wonder CNN is losing viewers.</p>

		<p>My admiration for blacks grows daily. They are the best race realists out there, making demands based on race, race feeling, and race privilege.  They are tribal, while we are Equal.  We are the losers.</p>
<p>Whites need to pay attention to the true RACE PATRIOTS- our African American population seems unwilling to go back to Africa and seems insistent and quite successful at shaking us Whites down for another dollar or million.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Newsrooms cut black journalists and supervisors at a higher rate than ever before in 2009 while the minority communities they cover grow larger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since almost all of them are unqualified and were strictly AA hires taken on when there was money to waste without affecting the bottom line too much, it&rsquo;s only logical that newsrooms have to keep only those journalists who are the most competent.  Black AA hires are not competent and are hired strictly as a political gesture.</p>
<p>But notice how blacks just love to complain about &#8220;minorities&#8221; when what they really mean are blacks.  By placing themselves under the same umbrella they hope to include themselves in with non-whites who can do the work.</p>
<p>But this situation of black layoffs doesn&rsquo;t just involve newsrooms.  All of corporate America is guilty of hiring token blacks. Some of them were forced to hire them or be boycotted by the likes of Jessie Jackson.  But whether black hires were the result of extortion or political correctness the fact remains that businesses hunkering down into survival mode are going to have to cut those whose employment are worthless or a burden to overall efficiency.</p>
<p>And, sorry, but that means blacks.  <br>

		<p>Two things about this story: It ignores the fact that many of the plagiarism scandals have involved black journalists, not to mention the cases of outright fraud by black journalists. </p>
<p>Also having the paper cover black culture in detail would be quite boring to the vast majority of readers.</p>

		<p>I noticed that some black reporters are not as good as white ones. For example, yesterday a black man was reporting from a hospital. A pilot was being treated there because of a plane crash. When the person behind the desk asked what caused the crash he responded, &#8220;that is still up in the air&#8221;. You could tell he immediately realized he should of worded that differently. Things like this seem to happen when only black are reporting. Their mistakes make me laugh though. </p>

		<p>What matters not is the overall demographics of an area, but who actually reads newspapers and who has the buying power that businesses require before paying for ad space.  Currently, the top of the bell curve demographically for most newspapers is an older population of whites.  Blacks and hispanics have lower literacy rates and do not read as much.  They also have less buying power.  Younger people tend not to read newspapers much at all.</p>
<p>Whenever newspapers abandon their core demographic group their circulation also drops.  The race obsessed Washington Post (I only get the Sunday edition) has more and more whiney articles about race and oppressed minorities.  The number of pages per edition is dropping noticeably.  No surprise its circulation is in free fall.  Time and Newsweek are now journalistic jokes who are only read by people in nursing homes if they can stand endless articles about Obama and feature stories such as &#8220;Is Your Baby Racist?&rdquo;.  USA Today is only read by people who are stranded in airports overnight&hellip;.maybe.</p>
<p>In summary, the article is analogous to two bald men fighting over a comb.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in black homes all the time as part of my job and I don&rsquo;t recall seeing but one black family that subscribed to a newspaper whereas a newspaper subscription is very common in white homes.  The fact that newspapers are laying off their minority staff seems to me to be just good business.  The reason I no longer subscribe to a newspaper is because of pro-affirmative action type stances that my hometown newspaper took.  My rationale was that if they wanted to cater to the interests of the black community, they could derive their revenue from the sales of newspapers to the black community.  If newspaper staff were to to become even more minority, then even more whites will flee and the newspaper&rsquo;s problems will exacerbate.  That is to say, they are caught in a vicious cycle of their own making.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Diversity Director&#8221;. That&rsquo;s one position that should be on the chopping block during this recession.</p>
<p>I prefer print media since its based on linguistic competence and easily fact-checked for accuracy and plagiarism. The usual suspects can&rsquo;t cut it in a print newsroom or reputable website. And if they can then its based on merit (unless there&rsquo;s a delay in firing them for incompetence due to AA hiring, but that usually fleshes out soon enough).</p>

		<p>&#8220;Can you accurately cover your community if you have a newsroom that doesn&rsquo;t look like your community?&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet there are no calls for white reporters to cover white communities, for whites of all stripes need the learning experience of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. No calls to make sure the white community is served by those who look just like the community. I suppose, while everyone else is celebrating their &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, even the idea of a white community must be evil. </p>

		<p>Haha, this is funny, because they same is happening in Europe.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, now the blacks take the jobs of the lefties who supported them all the time. The whole media is saying quotas to be good, now quotas will make white man in media jobless. In Germany theaters -which are producing left ideas only- are closing because the immigration they always supported takes now all money and nothing is left for theaters. </p>
<p>Welfare programs, diversity and quotas destroy the jobs of lefties, make their kids beaten up at schools bye non-whites, make them poor and lose all the safety and security they had before. There were left South Africans eather. Now there aren&rsquo;t any lefties in South Africa, because even lefties got right. The same will happen anywhere.</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;ve never bothered to do an actual statistical analysis of black vs. other race on-camera news persons, just casual observation would lead me to believe that black Africans are wildly overrepresented in that realm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re roughly thirteen percent the US population.  Yet they appear to comprise well in excess of that proportion among TV news personalities.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re losers as well.  They demand their own culture and what&rsquo;s best for blacks, yet they demand whites include them in our society.  They complain about whites, about America, talk about a black nation, yet I still see them living around the same people they despise so much.  Look at how messed up the black family is.  Is that honestly something you&rsquo;re jealous of?  Does that sound like a race of winners?</p>

<p>I believe you have missed the point of post #3.</p>
<p>It IS true that blacks and other NONwhites put their own race above all else. What the poster meant I believe is that it is the WHITES fault that White people do NOT put their race first. Whites tend to coddle and pander to every race but their own, you know, &#8220;love thy neighbor&#8221; propaganda that has been drummed into their heads by their &#8220;clergy&#8221; without even knowing what that and many other verses really mean and to WHOM it is meant.</p>
<p>In other words WE are the losers in demanding that all races are all equal,(which we are not) thereby putting us at a great disadvantage when we ignore this fact. Our (Whites) worlds declining population numbers should prove this and we will be extinct in the very near future because of our suicidal indoctrinated racial genocide.</p>

<p>- So is he saying that journalists who are not of the same race as their subjects lie and distort things?  Then there had better be no non-white reporters covering white concerns, by that logic.  Furthermore, I will agree with him.  Let&rsquo;s fire all white journalists in the big city newpapers and fill their slots with minorities.  Only libs will be fired, of course, and the newspaper will fold after three weeks due to lack of readership.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bowman links the decline in newspaper circulation to the rise in the minority population over the last several years. &ldquo;Readers are very smart and readers know whether or not their newspaper is covering news that is important and relevant to them,&rdquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>- The libs need to understand, and I don&rsquo;t know why they haven&rsquo;t yet: non-whites in general do not read newspapers, especially big ones with many pages!  So the more non-whites you bring in a city, the lower the readership, therefore, liberals are destroying their own favored places of employment.  That&rsquo;s why so many libs have transitioned to the net.  Traditional papers are losing readers as towns and cities lose their whites.  </p>
<p>I have never seen, ever, ever, ever seen a black person on the subway reading anything beyond one of those ten page local free papers filled with shock-jock kinds of gossip and stories, and even then that was very rare.  I have never seen a latino reading ANYTHING on the subway, ever.  I do see Asians reading sometimes, but usually their own language newpapers.<br>

		<p>Where I live, the news department at the #1 rated TV station had a black reporter on the morning news that everyone liked. She lost her job there a few months ago.</p>
<p>I asked a friend who worked there why she is gone. He said that, in a year where advertising revenues were down by 30%, and where all employees of the company had taken pay cuts, she had demanded a raise. She threatened to quit if she didn&rsquo;t get it. </p>

		<p>I quit subscribing to my local newspaper years ago when they kept advocating for amnesty for illegal aliens and endlessly extolling the virtues of diversity.  Of course they never mentioned the race of a suspect in a crime, lest we develop any doubts about the benefits of diversity.  I figured, let the illegal aliens and the rest of the diversity buy their rag.</p>
<p>Besides, everything is on the web these days.  Why kill all those trees?</p>
<p>As for television, I see it strictly as a medium for low entertainment.  Why sit there while some person reads the news to me when I can read it much faster myself?<br>

<p>What is this crazy obsession with appearance - the more obvious manifestation of race - in these people? These are the intellectual decendants of MLK, who called for a race-blind society? Their obsession is getting bizzare.</p>
<p>Besides, do they not know that people outside a particular race or culture can often see things that people within that same race or culture are blind to (or are too afraid to say, in the case of race relations in the West)? For example, read some Russian online reporting to find how they see through things here in the US we don&rsquo;t even notice, or dare not say.</p>

		<p>In a more lucrative era, before the LA Times drove all of its White readers away due to non-White pandering, the local government schools received stacks and stacks of free Times every single day including on Sundays.  The LA Times paid for teacher training sessions including extremely expensive release time, provided lunch for everyone, scads of teaching materials (all PC aligned, of course), art and drafting supplies and more.</p>
<p>The idea was for teachers to use the papers to create future Times readers and subscribers.  The LA Times, as low as it is written and as filled as it is with PC madness and illegal alien sob stories is too sophisticated for the new White replacement population.</p>
<p>All of that is gone now, as the LA Times is in its final death throes (and not a moment too soon as far as I&rsquo;m concerned). If they&rsquo;d stopped insulting their White base  &mdash;  the ones that could actually read the dumbed-down paper  &mdash;   they might still be a thriving business.</p>
<p>I did get one useful idea from an LA Times PC indoctrination session:  I learned how to use the the classified section to create Mondrian-like artwork.  Great lesson for high school students who cannot read the paper, which is the vast majority of them these days. </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Whites need to pay attention to the true RACE PATRIOTS&hellip; quite successful at shaking us Whites down for another dollar or million&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the USG has its boot on our White necks and has effectively neutered White resistance, giving blacks an opening, otherwise blacks would NEVER be able to shake us down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you know the difference between a black screaming discrimination and a White screaming discrimination:  At least a million dollars for the black, loss of job, and reputation for Whites.</p>
<p>And finally, from #19, Anonymous:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In other words WE are the losers in demanding that all races are all equal&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>WE do not demand that all races are equal.  Our government demands that WE accept this without question.</p>
<p>How far our government has taken us from James Madison&rsquo;s words! (I copied this from the back of my James Madison $5 gold coin):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Equal laws protecting equal rights are the best guarantee of loyalty and love of country&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>All the best to All!!!  (John PM allows ME to use his patented phrase, including copious exclamation points, free of charge).</p>

		<p>Bon, I always thought that if I were a teacher and forced to have that commie rag LA Times in my classroom I&rsquo;d use it to teach math.</p>
<p>First measurement.  How many column inches on the 4th page are content and how many column inches are advertising.  Convert to feet.  Then fractions and percentages.  Some pages are 90 percent advertising.  Then I would introduce a little 4/5th grade economics.  Why pay money for something that is 80 percent advertising.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are hispanics sitting behind tables of LA Times papers offering free 3 month subscriptions.  I always tell them I don&rsquo;t want a lifetime subscription to the commie rag.</p>
<p>I often see Russians, Persians and Armenians reading their own language papers.  Don&rsquo;t assume they can&rsquo;t read English. Often they speak perfect English but despise the pro black and hispanic LA Times and prefer their own community newspaper.</p>
<p>LA Times owns a Spanish language newspaper.  I don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen anyone reading it.  Of course many Los Angeles hispanics can speak some form of Spanish but can&rsquo;t read it due to the fact that they had to drop out of school back home at age 8.  Most of the newcomer hispanics are ethnically pure Indians straight from their stone age villages and can neither speak nor read Spanish.</p>
