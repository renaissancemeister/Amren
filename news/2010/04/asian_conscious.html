	<p>For many Asian Americans, especially Chinese Americans, the Wen Ho Lee spying case pushed them decisively in the direction of racial consciousness. Mr. Lee is a Taiwan-born scientist who became a naturalized US citizen and worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. In 1999, he was accused of spying for China and was held for nine months in solitary confinement during an investigation.</p>
<p>The case never came to a conclusion, partly because the <cite>New York Times</cite> leaked his identity and the resulting coverage derailed the investigation. Espionage charges were withdrawn as part of a plea bargain, in which Mr. Lee confessed to one felony count of improperly downloading classified information to unsecured computers. He never gave a plausible explanation for why he needed this information. It also came to light that Chinese authorities had asked him to spy for them, and he had violated regulations by not reporting this.</p>

</table><p>The federal judge who handled the case pointed out to Mr. Lee that he had plead guilty to a serious crime but he also apologized for prosecutorial misconduct. Mr. Lee eventually won a judgment of $1.6 million from the US government and five different media companies because his identity as a suspect had been leaked.</p>
<p>It is a murky case, and certainly appears to have been mishandled by the government, but many Asian organizations were convinced it was a case of pure racial profiling. <cite>Asian Week</cite> wrote about Mr. Lee&rsquo;s &#8220;martyrdom,&#8221; and charged that Asians had been &#8220;singled out and looked upon with suspicion.&#8221; Albert Wang, a California doctor who championed Mr. Lee, called his prosecution &#8220;the major Chinese-American civil rights case in the last 30 years.&#8221; Karen Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium called Mr. Lee&rsquo;s case a &#8220;watershed.&#8221; &#8220;This community [Asians] bought into the notion that if you work hard, pay attention to your family, you will be accepted,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This case says it&rsquo;s not true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supporters created the Wen Ho Lee Defense Fund and raised $100,000 for his legal bills. The Association for Asian American Studies and a group called Asian Pacific Americans in Higher Education called on all Asian Americans to refuse to work for federal nuclear laboratories. They argued that because Asians and Asian Americans account for a quarter of all doctorates awarded in the US in science and technology, a boycott would seriously hurt the labs.</p>
<p>In 2004, four years after the plea bargain, the Asian legislative caucus in the California state house announced it would publicly honor Mr. Lee with a &#8220;profiles in courage&#8221; award. It backed down after a furious reaction from what Mr. Lee&rsquo;s supporters called &#8220;racist, right-wing zealots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly 10 years after charges were initially filed, Chinese-Americans were still angry about the Lee case, and fought President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s choice of former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson as commerce secretary. Mr. Richardson was energy secretary at the time of the Lee accusations and had cabinet-level responsibility for Los Alamos. <cite>Asian Week</cite> was convinced Mr. Richardson had encouraged the prosecution exclusively for racial reasons: &#8220;It was a de facto APA [Asian Pacific Islander] witch-hunt set off by Richardson&rsquo;s green light: the xenophobic targeting of Lee as a spy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Richardson found a way to use fear of Asians to whip up hysteria against Asian Americans not seen since World War II.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Richardson withdrew his nomination because of an investigation into business dealings as governor of New Mexico. Had he not done so, Asian groups would have tried to stop his appointment, even if it meant angering Hispanics, who strongly favored Mr. Richardson.</p>
<p>The case certainly raised sensitive questions. Is it possible Mr. Lee could have been tempted to spy for China because of a feeling of kinship? It is well known that, loyalties, whether national, ethnic, or racial are deeply emotional.</p>
<p>On some occasions, Chinese living in North America have not been shy about expressing their deepest loyalties. In 1999, the American women&rsquo;s soccer team met the Chinese team in Los Angeles for the finals of the Women&rsquo;s World Cup. Los Angeles has long had large Chinese communities from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the mainland that felt little love for each other, but they set aside their differences to root with one voice for the Chinese team. &#8220;There are political differences, but because the team is Chinese, that&rsquo;s all we think about,&#8221; explained Louis Wong, a Chinatown news vendor who came from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Two groups that did not ordinarily get along  &mdash;  the Chinese consulate and conservative Chinese business organizations  &mdash;  joined forces to buy seats in the same section so thousands of Chinese-American fans could sit together and make a tremendous din for the Beijing team. The idea that Chinese might have come together to root for their new homeland would have been laughable. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a US citizen, but I&rsquo;m Chinese,&#8221; explained businessman Edward Chang.</p>
<p>When China hosted the Olympic Games in 2008 the sentiment of Canadian-Chinese was much the same. Andrea Chun, a Toronto lawyer and television host, explained that &#8220;when it comes to the games, most Chinese-Canadians are rooting for China, to be honest,&#8221; adding, &#8220;They won&rsquo;t admit it if you ask them, but for sure they are.&#8221; Rich Chan, a personal trainer who had lived his entire life in Canada was happy to admit it. &#8220;I&rsquo;m going with China. China all the way,&#8221; he said.</p>

</table><p>Athletic teams represent nations in contests that have decisive, win-or-lose outcomes. International athletics therefore feed many of the emotions aroused by war. In Los Angeles, Chinese-Americans did their best to give the Beijing team a home-field advantage when it played the American team. Would it be so surprising if some of the thousands who cheered the Chinese team expressed their loyalty in other ways? Is it wrong to wonder if they might?</p>
<p>China is hungry for American technology, and devotes a major part of its huge espionage effort to the United States. The Chinese method of spying is different from that of the classic, Soviet technique of sending trained professionals to burrow deep into enemy infrastructure. Beijing gets intelligence from thousands of part-time and amateur spies: students, businessmen, and Chinese citizens of target countries. According to the US government <cite>Intelligence Threat Handbook,</cite> 98 percent of the Americans the Chinese approach for information are Chinese-Americans: &#8220;Ethnic targeting to arouse feelings of obligation is the single most distinctive feature of PRC intelligence operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a joint FBI/CIA report, &#8220;When approaching an individual of Chinese origin, the Chinese intelligence services attempt to secure his or her cooperation by playing on this shared ancestry.&#8221; David Szady, chief of FBI counterintelligence operations explained that Chinese spies &#8220;don&rsquo;t consider anyone to be American-Chinese. They&rsquo;re all considered overseas Chinese.&#8221; He noted that the politically correct pretense that American citizens never fall for this appeal interferes with the FBI&rsquo;s counterespionage work.</p>
<p>Actual arrests, which, according to government sources, &#8220;are just the tip of the iceberg of an already-large and increasingly capable PRC [Peoples Republic of China] intelligence effort,&#8221; show that some Chinese-Americans are, indeed, susceptible to racial-nationalist appeals. In 2004, seven officers and employees of two New Jersey companies were arrested for transferring sensitive information on radar, smart weapons, and electronic warfare to Chinese government research institutes. The presidents of Universal Technologies and Manten Electronics were among the seven. Five were naturalized Chinese-Americans and the other two were permanent-resident Chinese.</p>
<p>Likewise in 2004, Ting-Ih Hsu, a naturalized US citizen and president of Azure Systems, pleaded guilty in Orlando, Florida, to exporting to China low-noise amplifier chips used in Hellfire missile systems. Also pleading guilty was Hai Lin Nee, a Chinese citizen and an employee of Azure Systems.</p>
<p>In 2005, Chi Mak, a naturalized Chinese American who held a &#8220;secret&#8221; level security clearance, was arrested for stealing classified details of submarine propulsion systems from his employer, Power Paragon, of Anaheim, California. His wife and a number of other family members helped him copy the information and deliver it to China. Mr. Mak was convicted in 2007 and sentenced to 241⁄2 years in prison in 2008. Also in 2005, Zhao Xin Zhu was sentenced in Boston to two years in prison and three years of supervised release after pleading guilty to trying to send night vision equipment and satellite technology to China. That same year, Jinghua and Xiuwen Liang, both naturalized citizens living in Thousand Oaks, California, were sentenced to 21⁄2 years imprisonment for exporting parts of F-14 fighters and various missile systems to China.</p>
<p>Likewise in 2005, naturalized citizens Ning Wen and his wife, Hailin Lin, were arrested in Wisconsin for smuggling electronics for use in missiles and radar systems. In 2006, Mr. Wen was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine.</p>
<p>In 2006, Xiangdong Sheldon Meng, a naturalized US citizen living in Cupertino, California, was arrested for stealing night vision training software from a Silicon Valley defense contractor and trying to sell it to military buyers in Thailand, Malaysia, and China. That same year Fei Ye, a naturalized US citizen, and Ming Zhong, a permanent US resident, pleaded guilty to stealing civilian chip technology from Silicon Valley firms for delivery to China.</p>

<p>In February 2007, China-born, naturalized citizen Hanjuan Jin of Schaumburg, Illinois, was stopped at Chicago&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hare airport with a one-way ticket to Peking, $30,000 in cash, and an estimated $600 million worth of trade secrets stolen from Motorola and another Chicago-area electronics firm, Lemko. In March 2008, she was charged with stealing trade secrets to take to China.</p>
<p>In 2008, the president of a Virginia-based high-tech company, Quan-Sheng Shu, pleaded guilty to selling rocket technology to China. A naturalized citizen, he was fined $400,000 and received a sentence of four years and three months. Likewise in 2008, naturalized citizen Tai Shen Kuo pleaded guilty in Alexandria, Virginia to selling data on Taiwan&rsquo;s air defenses to China.</p>
<p>In February 2009, Yaming Nina Qi Hanson of Maryland was caught trying to take flight controls for miniature reconnaissance planes to China. She said she wanted to help China in its development efforts.</p>
<p>In July 2009, a federal judge found Dongfan &#8220;Greg&#8221; Chung guilty of delivering space shuttle secrets to China. Since 1973, when he started work at Rockwell International, he had stored more than 300,000 pages of secret documents in his home. &#8220;Mr. Chung has been an agent of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China for over 30 years,&#8221; Judge Cormac Carney wrote, and noted that the naturalized US citizen &#8220;proudly proclaimed [China] as his &#8220;motherland&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other Asian-Americans have been disloyal. Robert Kim, a naturalized citizen from South Korea who worked as an intelligence analyst for the Navy, was arrested in 1996 for turning over classified information to the South Korean Embassy. In an interview in 2004 after he was released from seven years in jail, he claimed to love America, his &#8220;adopted country,&#8221; but in an interview published in a South Korean paper he said he considered himself Korean first and foremost. Korean supporters called him a true patriot.</p>
<p>There is no official count of the number of Chinese-Americans who have been convicted of spying or helping the Chinese arms industry but there must be scores of them. Only Wen Ho Lee ever became a cause célèbre or prompted accusations of racial profiling. Was he really the victim of an anti-Asian witch hunt or was he a spy whose investigation was bungled? Whatever his supporters may say, racial and national ties are strong, and American counterespionage efforts must take them into consideration.</p>

</table><p>Clearly, only a small number of Asian-Americans are spies for China. However, there can be no doubt that Asians are more likely to spy for China than are non-Asians, and if they are going to be spies they are far more likely to spy for an Asian country than for Russia, for example. National bonds are strong.</p>
<p>This is not to place special blame on Asians. If Mexico were trying to develop sophisticated weapons and Mexican-Americans were in a position to help them, they would probably be just as active as Asians. Indeed, if roles were reversed, whites would probably be just as likely to be disloyal citizens of Asian nations. Questions of loyalty are always a problem in heterogeneous nations and security breaches will always be more common in such a nation than in one that is homogeneous.</p>
<p>At the same time, the very diversity of the United States and the openly parochial identities of so many non-whites have encouraged Asian Americans to reverse course on the road to assimilation. They are a group that at one time made great efforts to assimilate, but as blacks, Mexicans, and other Hispanics cultivate distinctive identities  &mdash;  and win political power, cultural recognition, and &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; benefits by doing so  &mdash;  why should Asians remain the &#8220;model minority&#8221; that does not try to thrust itself forward? It is no wonder that younger Asians now reject a label their elders worked to earn.</p>
<p>The Japanese-American poet Amy Uyematsu, who was born after the war, criticized her parents&rsquo; and grand-parents&rsquo; generations for trying to gain acceptance by &#8220;denying their yellowness&#8221; and complained that they were &#8220;white in every respect but color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill Seki, a Los Angeles lawyer born in the early 1960s, takes a similar view. He says his Japanese-American parents tried very hard to assimilate, to become &#8220;Americans first,&#8221; but the result was that &#8220;people take Japanese Americans for granted.&#8221; Mr. Seki does not want to be taken for granted. Instead, he says: &#8220;One comment you commonly get is, &#8216;You&rsquo;re just like another white guy.&rsquo; No, that&rsquo;s completely wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presumably Mr. Seki&rsquo;s parents would have considered it high praise to be thought no different  &mdash;  and treated no differently  &mdash;  from whites, but that view is passé. Race or ethnicity now comes before a larger American identity. The one racial group in addition to whites that at one time seemed committed to transcending race is moving away from that commitment.</p>

		<p>Why do so many non-whites show loyalty to the race and country where they or their ancestors are from?</p>
<p>It is, of course, because non-whites have a strong identity and putting loyalty above one&rsquo;s race and/or country of origin is encouraged, even if they are born in the West, something the US has been discouraging now for many years.  Here the elitists, so fearful of losing power and money, have installed a system of mind conditioning that is prevalent from the entertainment entities to schools and, from there, into the professions at large, especially journalism and academia.</p>
<p>Unlike non-white countries, self appointed elitists in the West have been conned into believing that importing warm bodies is vital to maintaining an adequate tax base for the government and a new pool of consumers for the greedy corporate geeks. There are many options to such a policy all of which would allow for a mostly homogeneous society, but they are ignored, so fanatically dedicated is the rush for self-destruction.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s taxes or consumption, the present immigration theories are based in a hysterical lust to satisfy greed mongers who should have been ousted years ago.</p>
<p>This empire is self-destructing right before our eyes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Race or ethnicity now comes before a larger American identity&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this statement is dishonest and inaccurate, latter for sure. It seems to suggest that the &#8216;larger American identity&rsquo; is somehow mutually exclusive with racial or ethnic identity while it is not. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact the very reason for the existence of Amren is that the racial aspect of the &#8216;larger American identity&rsquo; is transforming from being mostly white to a medley of races.</p>
<p>As a non-white non-American,before coming to the US a few years ago the word &#8216;American&rsquo; always invoked the image of a white person in my mind while acknowledging the possibility of an occasional [12%] black or a rare native. After coming here and seeing things around I feel that America should remain a majority white country.</p>
<p>Nevertheless that statement is what it is, plain wrong!</p>

		<p>There are no demographic,cultural, economic or ecological reasons for importing Asians into our America. We don&rsquo;t need them. How did native born white Americans manage to survive without them when there hardly any Asians migrating to our America? Very well thank you.</p>

		<p>  While I&rsquo;m a great admirer, and collector, of East Asian Art, East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans) do have a racial consciousness lacking among contemporary American whites.  This has helped make those races great and they&rsquo;ve contributed much to the advancement of civilization. However, as these groups become more pronounced in America, their racial thinking/ethnic lobbying only increases.  I personally like the East Asian component of our country, but American whites, as the founders of the United States, have a right to keep the ethnic traditions, racial integrity and the majority status of their group. For this reason, I favor limited immigration from Japan, China, and Korea.  Of course, I would also favor limited immigration from Europe and little or no further immigration from the Third World.</p>

		<p>I believe it is possible to retain one&rsquo;s racial culture and still be 100% American.  I have known many Japanese families who have done exactly that over the years, with great success.  I am proud to have these people as my friends.  The Chinese, though, are a very different culture.  They are often called &#8220;the Jews of the Orient&#8221; because they are extremely shrewd with money and investing.  I would be perfectly fine with having a professional financial advisor who is either Chinese or Jewish - they are the best, pure and simple.  However, the Chinese who are not in the higher income brackets in this country try to make it big any way they can, and their methods are much more sophisticated than those of the ignorant blacks who just rob people and places of business.  Chinese aspiring rich guys are smart, and try to sell very sophisticated items to buyers on a market the blacks don&rsquo;t even know exists.  The Chinese tend to steal from their own people, too, rather than go to trans-racial thievery.  These crooks still need to be prosecuted and jailed, but I have a lot more respect for the smart mainly nonviolent criminals than I do for the stupid ones who just use guns and brawn with no brains.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never dealt with Asians in a political context, but I have in commercial settings. In contexts of family, tribe, or race they seem to have no respect whatsoever for the rule of law in the realm of IPP (Intellectual Property Protocols).  If a foreign company sends a mold or a patented product design concept to China for mass-production, it can almost invariably count on Jun Lee&rsquo;s Happy Works CEO&rsquo;s cousin down the street knocking the thing off and flooding the international marketplace with your widget.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re certainly right about the Chinese apparently having no respect for intellectual property protocols, thought they&rsquo;re equal opportunity IPP thieves, stealing designs from us, the Japanese, Europeans, and anybody else with good ideas and designs.  They&rsquo;re masters at reverse engineering, most motorbikes in China, for example, being exact knock-offs of Japanese designs.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, however, they&rsquo;re relatively unique in this regard among Asian industrial nations.  I don&rsquo;t believe the Japanese or South Koreans engage in these activities to any great extent.</p>

		<p>Yes, of course we Chinese are cunning. That is good. Why reinvent the wheel? </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we now have brandnames for local companies like Hongda and Wumart - much to the chagrin of multinational companies (who says we aren&rsquo;t creative :))<br/>

<p>I say its the smart way to go about things at this stage. </p>
<p>At the moment Chinese are not into proving how clever or creative they are. We won&rsquo;t to get rich - by any means necessary. When we are rich we will start playing the nice guy, and respect the rules.</p>
<p>Afterall when Europeans were after Chinese wealth not too far back in history, it was just rule of the gun - &#8216;buy this opium&hellip; or else.&rsquo; Now you are rich, you can pretend to be Mr Nice Guy - but even then that does not stop you from obliterating hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of oil.</p>

<p>WELL!! considering the Chinese account for a HUGE part of the human population on this planet, their activity is certainly liable to affect the other huge part.</p>

		<p>@ 9  &mdash;  John Liu - With regard to opium, wasn&rsquo;t it also the case that Chinese sold out other Chinese? Would it have been possible if Chinese officials had not been open to bribes to allow the Brits with their opium in? The same sort of culture that exists today when it comes to poisoning their own with toxic milk powder and the like - as long as some people higher up take their cut you can make it happen. You can&rsquo;t blame it all on the white man, much as you like to.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;you can pretend to be Mr Nice Guy - but even then that does not stop you from obliterating hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of oil.&#8221;</p>
<p>The killing of Irakis in the name of oil, as you say, is real, but it is a thing that was decided by the American governement, and the people of the US, have had little oer nothing to do with it. Except for the US soldiers who were sent there, of course&hellip; but those people are often young Americans of different colors (not just Whites) who signed a contract to join the army to pay for their college education, because tuition fees in American universities are so unbelievably high! </p>

		<p>To the moderators of American Renaissance:<br/>
I believe the following link will truly help in keeping matters in perspective.  Typically, you like to omit my submissions; I can only guess as to your reasons.  As for myself, I like to pursue truth as far as it is humanly possible.  I also believe in fairness in all aspects of living.  I hope you can keep this in mind, and I respectfully ask that you allow the posting of this submission.  Thank you.</p>
<p>Try Googling the following search string: [ spies convicted in the United States ].</p>
<p>The third weblink on the first page of results may be the following:  www.fas.org/sgp/library/spies.pdf, which is entitled,</p>
<p>PERSEREC Technical Report 02-5 July 2002<br/>
Espionage Against the United States by American Citizens 1947-2001.<br/>
Katherine L. Herbig<br/>

TRW Systems<br/>
Research Conducted by Defense Personnel Security Research Center<br/>
Approved for Public Distribution: Distribution Unlimited.</p>
<p>Please see page 37 of the PDF file, which is labeled page 17 of the content.  It paints a very different reality from what is popularly assumed.  Please see Appendix A which lists the convicted spies.  </p>
<p>On a personal note, I was targeted for recruitment for spying.<br/>
After many decades of reflection, I can offer to you my opinion that a foreign nation wants one of two things when recruiting a spy:<br/>
1.  The documents, hardware, or software which may be accessible by the potential recruit.  (This is the most common case.)<br/>
2.  The potential recruit himself through the process of defection to another country.  (This is the rarest of cases but the most prized.)</p>
<p>As many problems as the United States of America has, I love my country, and very innocently, I professed my love for the United States of America during a dinner party (which I later figured out to be held in my &#8220;honor&#8221;).  I failed the defection test.  I was never contacted again.  It was actually many decades later that I realized that I was targeted.  I believe many of you would be amazed how subtle the process really is.</p>
<p>I feel very proud of myself for two reasons:<br/>
1.  I was worthy of being targeted.<br/>
2.  I failed the test.</p>
<p>Thank you and have a pleasant evening.</p>
