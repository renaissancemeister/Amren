			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spencer S. Hsu, Washington Post, Aprl 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge Tuesday ordered a rural county in southwestern Mississippi to stop segregating its schools by grouping African American students into all-black classrooms and allowing white students to transfer to the county&rsquo;s only majority-white school, the U.S. Justice Department announced.</p>
<p>The order, issued by Senior Judge Tom S. Lee of the U.S. District Court of Southern Mississippi, came after Justice Department civil rights division lawyers moved to enforce a 1970 desegregation case against the state and Walthall County.</p>
<p>Known as Mississippi&rsquo;s cream pitcher for its dairy farms and bordering Louisiana 80 miles north of New Orleans, Walthall County has a population of about 15,000 people that includes about 54 percent white residents and 45 percent African American residents, according to the U.S. Census.</p>
<p>For years, the local school board has permitted hundreds of white students to transfer from its Tylertown schools, which are about 75 percent African American and serve about 1,700 students, to another school, the Salem Attendance Center, which is about 66 percent white and serves about 577 students in grades K-12. The schools are about 10 miles apart.</p>
<p>Salem became &#8220;a racially identifiable white school while the student enrollment of the Tylertown schools has become predominantly black&#8221; because of the transfers, U.S. officials alleged in December, based on data from the 2007-08 school year, according to Lee&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>At the same time in Tylertown four K-12 schools, &#8220;District administrators group, or &#8216;cluster,&rsquo; disproportionate numbers of white students into designated classrooms .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. resulting in significant numbers of segregated, all-black classrooms at each grade level,&#8221; the judge wrote, summarizing the Justice Department lawyers&rsquo; case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walthall school officials have said they will comply with the consent decree. But they have pointed out that because of how district lines are drawn, some students within Tylertown boundary lines actually live closer to Salem. They have also said there are not enough white students remaining to spread out evenly across Tylertown classes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lee required county schools, starting this fall, to bar student transfers within the district except in cases involving a risk to the child&rsquo;s health or safety, major hardship, a parent employed at the receiving school or a resulting reduction of the racial disparity in both the child&rsquo;s old and new schools. Rising seniors set to graduate in 2011 would also be exempted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to county data requested by the U.S. Justice Department in 2007, Walthall County schools allowed transfers that made the racial composition of Salem&rsquo;s student body &#8220;fifteen percent more white&#8221; in the 2007-08 school year, or 66 percent instead of 51 percent. If the transferred students stayed at Tylertown schools, white students would have represented 31 percent of students, up from 22 percent.<br>

		<p>The parents should take their kids  &mdash;  and move. Simple? Of course not. Unfortunately, the most important issues in life are NEVER simple. However,compared to what the immigrants went through that established the U.S.,it is simple. The &#8220;system&#8221;,is not set up to help people on these issues, and if it was it wouldn&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t their agenda. What can save the U.S. from central government tyranny, is millions of Americans realizing that they have to decide to disconnect themselves in as many ways possible from the corruption that they KNOW, they are dependent on. We need to go local and support those people that support us. The big multinational corporations, connected as they are with Wall Street criminality and thus, political criminality, are in no way helping the citizens of this nation. They will NEVER HELP the citizens of this nation, especially those that do most of the work.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like being around large numbers of blacks would certainly involve a risk to the health or safety of the white students.</p>

		<p>Next it will be illegal for whites to assocaite with their family, presuming they&rsquo;re all white.  Then it will be illegal for whites to not want to work for an employer who happens to be non-white.  Then it will be illegal for a group of whites to even be walking together for a night out on the town.  Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Think I&rsquo;m paranoid?  Remember how the same people who voted for Obama thought we were paranoid for thinking he&rsquo;d be a racist, black socialist?  Now they&rsquo;re seeing we were right.</p>

<p>It reveals much about this judge&rsquo;s ignorance that he doesn&rsquo;t even comprehend the fact that any time a white student is placed among blacks, there will be risk to the child&rsquo;s health and safety and major hardship.  This is just another attack in the ongoing war against the South.</p>

		<p>Well, guess what, Judge!  You just guarenteed that the private school enrollment will rise, as will the numbers of whites who homeschool their kids.  No white person in their right mind will send their kids to a predominantly black school.  We are SO done with PC - we just aren&rsquo;t going to take it any more.  We know that kids learn best with other kids who are LIKE themselves, rather than trying for an unnatural mixing of the races.  It has not worked for the past 40+ years and it will not work now.  Blacks can whine all they want, but until they improve their BEHAVIOR, no whites are going to willingly go to school with them.  I would never send my child to a black school where s/he could very easily get beaten up, raped, and/or killed.  No way.</p>

<p>The Justice Department seems to be violating the spirit of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Section 401 of which reads:</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8216;Desegregation&rsquo; means the assignment of students to public schools and within such schools without regard to their race, color, religion or national origin, but desegregation shall not mean the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial imbalance.&#8221;</p>

<p>To all white posters who read this article: if you have white kids and you really love them and want them to have a good education, take them out of the public school system ASAP. Homeschooling or private schools would be better (and safer) for them.</p>

		<p>..ok, ok folks of mississippi, here is what you do. you play the same game of social engineering that they do. first you find out where this judge lives. you get a group together with signs and surround his all-white gated community in protest. make sure your signs accuse him and his neighborhood of being racist for being all-white, and keep it up for as long as his order stands. we must fight fire with fire with these communists, marxists. you also follow him with signs calling him a racist when he goes out to restaurants or social events, on the golf course, his private clubs etc. turn this into all out war with these pc type judges. they use the word racist against us, us it back against them two fold, because in almost every case i have looked into, these pc types keep themselves isolated in all-white communities. make his neighborhood a living hell for him and his neighbors, then they will throw him out. do it do it.</p>

		<p>I do not know the laws in Mississippi but you should undertake some plan to abolish property taxes and any other taxes that fund the public fool system. Go on the attack. Do not sit back and allow the other side to think up more hogwash for you. Make them spend their time trying to hold on to what they have.</p>
<p>Form home schools and home school cooperatives and get out public education. It is nothing but a brainwashing mechanism to make race-mixing communists out of our children. Just go to a school event and look at the white girls slobbering all over the black boys. GET AWAY FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS!</p>

		<p>I also wonder about that philosophy that says blacks have to sit with whites in order to learn.  No one says that whites have to sit with blacks to learn.  Of course they do say that whites are somehow (unspecified) harmed by not experiencing the &#8216;richness&rsquo; of diversity.</p>
<p>Where I work, there are simply no white students around anywhere.  They are all black, hispanic and asian - for miles in every direction.  </p>
<p>In the absense of whites, why do they not try real hard to integrate say, black and asian kids.  If whites had a &#8216;magic&rsquo; that could rub off on blacks, then Asians should have even more of it because so many are study freaks.</p>
<p>I think we need to push for asian integration with blacks.  Yeah, see how racist the asians become!  That should get the libs off our backs for a while.</p>

With all the experience and evidence before them, do the advocates of desegregation believe minority performance will improve?</p>
<p>It seems to me that with all the examples we have about the failure of integrated schools to raise minority achievement that someone would have seen this as a waste of time. </p>

<p>It will not take long until they have quotas for private schools.<br>
I mean they nowadays even try to make quotas for villages, then for companies and then everywhere where whites are a majority. Even if blacks get 80% of the population they will look for white areas to make quotas there. <br>
Private schools and home schooling are maybe a solution for a short time. But whites can only survive, when they make their own schools and (may in a few years) say &#8220;NO!, we will not fallow your order. We are in a free country and we want to live that way!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have long suspected that a big part of the motivation behind this elitist insanity to force white children into heavily black public school districts - is to open up opportunities for aggressive young black males to have easier access to our white daughters, whereby they can then use the &#8216;white guilt tripping&rsquo; tactics that they&rsquo;ve been taught - to pressure white girls into accepting date demands coming from black males. </p>
<p>If white girls refuse, then they get called racists and - since there is no other demographic segment of our population who are more worried about being &#8216;trendy&rsquo; and &#8216;fashionable&rsquo; and &#8216;hip&rsquo; than young, immature, white teenage girls, this guilt-trip tactic works with an amazingly high degree of success.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d agree with the AR readers who advocate home schooling.  In fact, here is an idea that I&rsquo;ve thought about that I&rsquo;d to share with the AR community.   If it is financially feasible, why couldn&rsquo;t several white families pool their resources - to help lower the cost per family, and hire a fully qualified, certified teacher as a private contractor?   A suitable location could be found, somewhere reasonably accessible to all of the families involved, where a class room environment could be established.  The parents could meet with the teacher prior to the beginning of the school year and go over the course materials and content and eliminate any Cultural Marxist oriented anti-white garbage and focus on teaching the basics, and on teaching a positive view of European and American history.   The teacher would work directly for the families who placed them on contract; salary and benefits and course guidelines could be negotiated between all parties involved.   </p>
<p>I think that this idea is a worthwhile one, especially since many white families might not be able to shoulder their own careers and bread-winning chores and do the home-schooling themselves.   </p>
<p>So, how does this sound to others in the AR community?  </p>

<p>Yes, and they are quite belligerent, angry and litigious about it. But when Mongols or whoever all settle in one neighborhood, or when a workplace a school a neighborhood or even an entire city now, when things are all black, well that&rsquo;s just celebrating diversity and cause for an intellectual jamboree. </p>

		<p>The destruction of the white race is well underway. What is really horrifying is that it is being done with the complicity of many whites, who don&rsquo;t seem to understand, well, much of anything. The reality is that non-whites, with few exception, don&rsquo;t want parity with whites (as if that were ever really attainable) but to be the masters. They recognize that victory is in numbers. The more they can &#8220;integrate&#8221; into white areas, the closer they are to that victory. Whites who do not have the courage to recognize and resist this are not only traitors to their race but sheep being led to the slaughter. Whites must first and foremost not buy into the &#8220;white guilt&#8221; mantra incessantly spouted by the non-whites and be proud of the accomplishments of their forebearers. Civilization is essentially &#8220;White Civilization.&#8221; The ascent from the Dark Age was driven by the ideas and labor of white people. The history is far from idyllic but the ascent to civilization is undeniable. Civil rights is a white concept, and its implementation was at the direction of whites so that social justice may prevail.</p>
<p>But things have gone too far. The liberation of one race can&rsquo;t occur at the expense of another. Isn&rsquo;t that the lesson from history? One race must not benefit from the labor of another, unless that benefit is mutual. Yet here we are&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The theory behind desegregation and busing is that by holding white children hostage, their parents will feel compelled to fund minority schools, thereby making them better. Somehow, the thought that the minority students themselves make minority schools bad eludes them.</p>

The desegregation laws are a violation of the Constitutional right of freedom of association - but apparently no one is allowed to notice<br>

<p>So was the Civil Rights Act, but everyone seems to have forgotten that as well.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But when Mongols or whoever all settle in one neighborhood&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mongols, from thousands of miles away, settle into one neighborhood in America&hellip;   this is not seen as offensive as two white kids living next door to each other going to school. It&rsquo;s not seen as offensive or racist at all. Miraculously, from thousands of miles away, they end up in the same neighborhood. With a little help from government social workers and a little bit of community pride encouragement. But white kids, who live 20 feet away, have to be separated and shown how they are evil.</p>

		<p>Luke (#20) has some excellent ideas. Fortunately the solutions already exist. <a href="http://www.k12.com/" rel="nofollow">This site</a> offers courses for homeschoolers and others. Meanwhile, this private school has an fully functional online campus. All that&rsquo;s needed are parents willing to set aside the time and effort to make these alternative schools work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll repeat what I&rsquo;ve said here before: Nowadays, white parents who send their kids to public school are guilty of child abuse.</p>

		<p>Also, force integration on the Asians, who now have many successful enclaves of their own.</p>

<p>This is a stupid idea! What have Asians ever done to Whites, why do you want to destroy their homogeneity?! Their community should be an example of what Whites should be allowed to have as well. </p>

		<p>	I should think the non-white people of the world would appreciate the desire that many whites have to remove themselves. In any case ask yourself why the opposition&hellip; could it be that their relationship with us is essentially parasitic in nature?</p>

		<p>   It had to happen . Southerners have been busy defacto segregating . While allowed in other regions, it will not be allowed in the South . When Southern whites finally figure out the only road to survival is to get the heck out of Dodge, that will not be allowed either . We are no longer free . </p>

		<p>When will people realize that diversity is not natural, and that people will segregate themselves.  Certainly no one in our area has a problem with our &#8220;Historical Black Colleges&#8221;.  Diversity is a joke.</p>
