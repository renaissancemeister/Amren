			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Taranto, Wall Street Journal, April 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The political left claims to love racial diversity, but it bitterly opposes such diversity on the political right. This is an obvious matter of political self-interest: Since 1964, blacks have voted overwhelmingly Democratic. If Republicans were able to attract black votes, the result would be catastrophic for the Democratic Party. Even in 2008, the Democrats&rsquo; best presidential year since &#8216;64, if the black vote had been evenly split between the parties (and holding the nonblack vote constant), Barack Obama would have gotten about 48% of the vote and John McCain would be president.</p>
<p>To keep blacks voting Democratic, it is necessary for the party and its supporters to keep alive the idea that racism is prevalent in America and to portray the Republican Party (as well as independent challengers to the Democrats, such as the tea-party movement) as racist. The election of Barack Obama made nonsense of the idea that America remains a racist country and thereby necessitated an intensifying of attacks on the opposition as racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet to posit racism as an explanation is to ignore far more obvious and less invidious causes for the disparity. The tea-party movement&rsquo;s racial composition reflects a pre-existing partisan alignment: The movement arose in opposition to the policies of a Democratic government, and the vast majority of blacks are Democrats, or at least vote for Democrats. Pride in the first black president, a normal and wholesome attitude, reinforces this partisan allegiance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another factor that might keep blacks away from tea parties: the perception, whether true or not, that the movement is racist  &mdash;  a perception that liberal politicians and commentators have worked tirelessly (and tiresomely) to propagate. Add to this the risk of race-based opprobrium from fellow blacks and even from white liberals for deviating from the way blacks are &#8220;supposed&#8221; to think. </p>

The Tea Party movement is made up largely of middle class whites who are carrying the weight of over taxation.</p>
<p>The louder the screams of &#8216;racists&rsquo; become, the more average whites will see that THEY are the ones that are being targeted by their race.</p>
<p>If these people hold to their principles and are incessantly called &#8216;racists&rsquo;, it could spur a racial awareness and solidarity.</p>

		<p>The real problem I see here is fascism.  You have a struggle to control a strong centralized state that forces everyone to contribute to them.  Then, whomever wins the struggle is able to force their agenda on the entire nation.</p>
<p>The solution is what you see happening right now&hellip;.a STRONG move by states to stop contributing to the centralized government and a willingness to ignore its agenda.</p>
<p>Then it wouldn&rsquo;t matter anymore.  What blacks want to do in their voting districts (and ONLY with their own money) is their business.  What we do in ours is ours.</p>

		<p>Yes, but just as the left needs racism - racism needs the left! Or better to just say as the left needs blacks - blacks need the left! Blacks vote and lean left for one simple reason - the left is most generous to them. Blacks benefit most from liberal policies, racial preference programs, cradle-to-grave social services, etc. Simply put, blacks are the proverbial &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; of the left, but since they reap many rewards for their allegiance, they don&rsquo;t much seem bothered by that.  </p>
<p>The political right offers little in anything to most blacks. <br>

<p>Disagree.  If Republicans started attracting black votes, whites would react by voting Democrat.  It would be 1876 all over again.</p>
<p>The reason blacks don&rsquo;t go to tea parties is because tea partiers advocate less government, and blacks benefit from big government.  Occam&rsquo;s Razor.</p>

		<p>NBC, CBS, MSNBC, ABC, PBS, CNN, The New York Times and dozens of other large newspapers have been the leftist, pro-communist mouthpiece for the leftist, anti-American Democrat party since 1964. This is no surprise and I&rsquo;m glad the Wall Street Journal printed this story. It&rsquo;s the only national daily that reports with reason and facts instead of the leftist, anti-American agenda of most others.</p>

<p>Indeed, that is true Comrade Taranto!</p>
<p>However, like all hit singles, there is a B-side on this CD of yours; it is the fact that America has become a multicultural dictatorship run by plutocratic Marxists, dedicated toward the genocide of the white race. The very fact that you hold up General Secretary Obama as proof of &ldquo;racism&rsquo;s&rdquo; end, enhances this point. Thus, there is real racism in this country, but it is directed at the group considered to be &ldquo;racists&rdquo; by these plutocratic Marxists, the working-class and middle-class whites who actually produce something of value and pay the taxes to run the country. </p>
<p>Sadly this is not only endemic to the Democrats, but also to the Bush/McCain Neo Con Republicans as well!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>My thoughts exactly. This is also why Democrats cater to criminals, abortionists, gays, women, Muslims, Hispanics and any other perceived victims or minorities of society.  I have also said that if pedophiles represented a viable voting block the Dems would start catering to them by reducing sentencing for their crimes. Anything to get a vote.</p>
<p>Too bad the blacks have forgotten that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican and the southern Democrats were the party of slavery.</p>

<p>This writer makes it sound like he thinks there&rsquo;s a chance of that ever happening. The only way the Republican party could attract black votes is by turning its back on everything it stood for historically. Certainly the black race is never going to fundamentally change.</p>

		<p>Racism has just become another political tool/strategy by the Democrats. Hell, that&rsquo;s why hard core white leftists got on board with Obama. He&rsquo;s a tool to be used to achieve their socialist/anti-American goals. Disagree with them and they wave Obama in your face and call you a bigot in an attempt to shut you up.</p>

		<p>Nothing the Wall Street Journal says about race is really worth reading,  they&rsquo;re the prime example of Establishment Conservatism&rsquo;s collaboration with the Left in it&rsquo;s bid to destroy white America.   In fact this article is standard boilerplate from the Big Con collaborators that doesn&rsquo;t dare take on the real issue - the ongoing criminalization of whiteness by the dominant Left - instead it pretends that the problem with the Left&rsquo;s white-hating racism is that it is hard on blacks.  This is the usual tack of the coward right, indicative of Big Conservatism&rsquo;s collaboration in the deep, institutionalized white-hating racism of the rulers of this country.   It is similar to saying that what&rsquo;s important about  the recent racist &#8220;flash mob&#8221; beatings is that they showed that the blacks who committed them were hurting.   The Left does indeed need racism for a  variety of reasons, such as needing to feel morally superior,  the fact that race trumps democracy, and that a racial proletariat allows them to wage class warfare without seeming to do so; black votes are a minor issue.  After all, the left has been anti-white since at least the late 60s when non-white votes were so small as to be nearly insignificant.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the piece.  The author&rsquo;s premise that racism causes blacks to vote Democrat is wrong.  Blacks don&rsquo;t possess the ability to achieve economic parity with whites.  They will always support the party that finds some excuse to take from whites and give to them.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; isn&rsquo;t going anywhere.  The Democrats are only telling blacks what they want to hear.  <br>

		<p>This is exactly the situation in Britain. We are cursed with a scottish communist government who are hell bent on destroying the White English race who make up 83% of the English population. However, we are a handy source of revenue for scotland who use our English taxpayers money to fund their free university places and medical services. This communist government constantly warn afro-caribbean organisations about perfectly legal White political movements, such as the British National Party, and how blacks and other minorities are victims of institutional racism created by Whites holding any position of authority, especially in the Police or government service. There are many cases of very senior black or muslim labour figures being disgraced when their corruption is made public. Even so, labour is loathe to see them go and simply moves them sideways and conceals their misdemeanours. During the recent grounding of all flights over UK airspace due to volcano ash, the labour government said it would do everything possible to get British nationals home, even deploying 3 navy ships to help in evacuation from France and Spain. This was a total lie. 99% of these stranded tourists were White and of no interest but one warship did collect hundreds of British troops en-route from Afghanistan and loaded a group of black holidaymakers at the same time. The other 2 ships never left the English Channel. Dozens of coaches were promised to transport White tourist families from Spain to the Channel port in Calais but did not materialise as no blacks were stranded. Blacks always vote labour as labour gives them everything they whine and complain about. Just as in USA, blacks commit a disproportionate level of crime, fill the prisons and the kids constantly stab one another over tribal gang areas and drug deals. Black men do not live at home and black women are mostly single parents living on welfare in free housing&hellip; in black only ghettoes of course. Blacks only vote labour (democrats) and so do the muslim population who import a constant stream of illiterate relatives although our government deny this is so, describing them as family members who have a human right to join their relatives on the welfare gravy train. Our forthcoming general election should prove one thing&hellip; we live in interesting times.</p>

		<p>This article is nonsense.  Blacks vote Democratic because they support wealth transfer from rich to poor.  Articles like this are meant to argue that the GOP should NOT adopt any pro-white policies(like ending third-world immigration) because they will scare away black voters.  The whole agenda of Taranto and the WSJ is to keep whites deracinated in the vain hope that other races will decide to deracinate themselves too.  </p>
<p>BTW, James Taranto has a history of attacking racially aware whites.  The entire WSJ editorial page is virulently anti-white.  </p>
