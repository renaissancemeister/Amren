			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Lunn, Australian (Sydney), April 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>GRASSROOTS concern about Australia&rsquo;s burgeoning population is being ignored by the &#8220;hopelessly conflicted&#8221; major parties and needs a fresh voice in Canberra, says political hopeful William Bourke. </p>
<p>Mr Bourke, a Sydney small businessman and founder of the newly established Stable Population Party of Australia, plans to field candidates in all states at the next federal poll, running on a platform of restricting the nation&rsquo;s population to 23 million.</p>
<p>Mr Bourke says population growth might be a single issue, but it cuts across national policy agendas from health, housing and education to water, climate change  &mdash;  and particularly immigration.</p>
<p>He denies the fledgling party, formed in February, will be a honeypot for rednecks and racists, saying Australians are &#8220;capable of a mature and rational debate on the issue&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he says massive cuts are needed to Australia&rsquo;s current immigration intake, including from the skilled migration program, family reunions, the high volume of New Zealanders allowed in, and overseas students.</p>
<p>Net overseas migration, the difference between those entering Australia with plans to stay for more than a year and those leaving with the same intention, was 297,000 in the year to September last year.</p>
<p>Mr Bourke, who says he has never been a member of a political party, thinks that figure should be reduced to zero.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a balanced migration program, with immigration set at between 50,000 to 80,000 a year, matching the emigration that happens each year,&#8221; he told The Australian.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major parties are hopelessly conflicted between the will of the people and the will of their big business donors, and both sides are just as bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;They keep using this measurement of higher gross domestic product to indicate our wellbeing, but of course it&rsquo;s going to grow if you have a bigger population. The measure they should be using is GDP per capita, and that has fallen for the past five quarters in a row.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Cuts are not enough. Many non-White immigrants especially the Muslims like the Lebanese and blacks from Africa must be sent back. Besides special provisions must be made to help poor and lesser educated African Whites to go to Australia. A uneducated White worker is a better asset for Australia than an Asian Indian with a PhD.</p>

		<p>Note that he don&rsquo;t even need any explanations. All he has to do is, asking for a good multi cultural country and count all the countries where it went wrong: USA, Germany, Italy, Swiss, Austria, France, Britain, Spain, Portugal, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand,  and at least Australia itself.</p>
<p>If he just inform about the problems, he will win.</p>

		<p>This is excellent news. A one issue party is never likely to achieve power, but if enough people vote for it mainstream politicians will have to take its concerns on board - won&rsquo;t they?</p>

		<p>Jasper - agreed, and this party has made it clear that it won&rsquo;t discriminate on race for those lower numbers they think should be allowed to migrate, but on an issue that desperately needs to move forward, I think a huge cut in migrant numbers isn&rsquo;t a bad start. </p>
<p>I know that any success on that front would then run the risk of people thinking the issue is &#8216;over with&rsquo; and making it difficult for any race-based party to make gains, but with the numbers Australia has been letting in of late it really calls for something drastic, asap. When I weigh it all up I still lean toward it being a good thing.</p>

		<p>One can wish these people well but they have two formidable enemies.</p>
<p>They are the Australian cultural, academic and media elite, who love all the non-white world as a matter of principle, and the fat cats of the Australian capitalist class, who adore cheap, pliant and non-union labor and who fervently hope that Australia can and will follow the US and British model of privatized profits and socialized costs.</p>
