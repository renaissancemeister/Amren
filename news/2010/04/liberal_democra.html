<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/23/liberal-democrat-rise-ethnic-mps">Liberal Democrat Rise Could Push Out Black and Asian MPs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Harker, Guardian (London), April 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The surge in support for the Liberal Democrats could reduce representation in parliament for Britain&rsquo;s ethnic minorities, with high-profile black candidates from rival parties facing defeat.</p>
<p>The party has no black or Asian faces among its 63 MPs. Labour and Tory minority candidates who were previously on course to be elected are in danger of losing out.</p>
<p>These include the Labour minister Dawn Butler, taking on Lib Dem MP Sarah Teather in the newly formed seat of Brent Central; Tory Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, aka &#8220;the Black Farmer&#8221;, who was expected to take the seat of Chippenham, but now looks likely to lose to Lib Dem Duncan Hames; and even rising star Chuka Umunna, defending a Labour majority of over 7,000 in Streatham, who could be at risk from the Lib Dem candidate, Chris Nicholson.</p>
<p>Only four minority candidates are fighting for the Lib Dems in the party&rsquo;s top 100 target seats.</p>
<p>Henry Bonsu, co-founder of Colourful Radio, said: &#8220;In terms of the selection and promotion of minority candidates, for all their niceness, the Lib Dems are nowhere near good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dean McCastree was a Lib Dem councillor in the 1990s and is now standing as an independent in the Brent Central constituency  &mdash;  where the combined black and Asian population is over 50%.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We have to have representatives who reflect the society we have. By effectively pushing Dawn Butler out in this constituency, they&rsquo;re saying to minorities: &#8216;You don&rsquo;t need representation, we can do it for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was in the party, I tried to press them on equality but they didn&rsquo;t want to know. There&rsquo;s a lot of window dressing but most minority candidates are in unwinnable seats.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Cameron made highly publicised gestures to show that the Conservative party had changed and, before the Lib Dems&rsquo; surge, had 15 black and Asian candidates either defending majorities or, based on opinion polls, likely to gain seats.</p>
<p>Simon Woolley of Operation Black Vote, which next Wednesday hosts what is expected to be the largest ever black British political rally, said of Clegg: &#8220;He inherited a party resistant to change, and although he has made good progress, he still needs to convince a black electorate that transforming the party&rsquo;s racial make-up is a priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Lib Dem spokeswoman said the party had recently begun a programme of mentoring young minorities and this was already bearing fruit.<br>

		<p>Right, but as soon as the Lib-Dems get into office, they&rsquo;ll decry the &#8220;appalling&#8221; lack of minorities in the government and blame racist, conservative whites &amp; implement a &#8220;Rainbow Representation&#8221; program (or &#8216;programme&rsquo;). Face it, the only way parties win office in Western civilization is if they&rsquo;re white and fight for populist causes.</p>

		<p>You notice how the demand that the Libdems *must* include ethnic candidates is elevated to the status a grave ultimatum.<br>
 - They key to dealing with the overwhelming arrogance of the organised ethnic minorities is to simply ignore them.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting that the BNP was FORCED to have minorities in it&rsquo;s ranks, but the LIBERAL Dems don&rsquo;t and aren&rsquo;t.  But then, it&rsquo;s not the few black Dems in our country that vote all these Obaminations upon us.  It&rsquo;s the over whellmingly WHITE liberals who do so.  </p>

		<p>A White nation like Britain should not have Asian and black citizens in the first place let alone black and Asian MPs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny how that never applies to whites&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite the opposite for whites, as are most of these calls for &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; and &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo;. When it comes to areas that are all white, they have to import some minorities for the sake of diversity. Where it&rsquo;s a mostly, or an all non-white area, they make calls just like this one, for alike looking people to represent them and for greater empowerment and pride initiatives. And all non-white enclaves, this is where there are there most impassioned directives calling for respect for &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, by which they mean themselves. For them, identity politics and excluding whites is all just part of &#8216;celebrating&rsquo; diversity.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the origin of the Liberal Democrats in England.They were formed by three diisident Socialist M.P.s namely,David Owen,Shirley Williams and I forget the other one.They did not form out of an innate Ideology or to represent a section of Society.They are rooted in Socialism and cannot be trusted as Nu Labour cannot.I wish more people would remember that.</p>

		<p>These non-Whites insist they are only put forward for &#8216;safe&rsquo; seats to replace long standing Whites who have served their community for many years, irrespective of political leanings. The BEMs cannot bear the shame of losing an election. Forget science fiction, the BEMs are not Bug Eyed Monsters but black and ethnic minorities although both groups are aliens! The one thing they will NEVER do is form their own political party as their own &#8216;communities&rsquo; simply do not trust them and no White would vote for them anyway. The mainstream parties have seen so many of these BEMs elevated into high positions only to fall into humiliating public disgrace. It looks like lessons have been learnt the hard way. Twice bitten perhaps.</p>
