<h1>Race Outbursts Sign of Unhealed Wounds in S Africa</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Paul, Google News, April 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A white politician stormed out of a live TV debate about race relations and a black leader of the ruling African National Congress threw racial epithets at a journalist he kicked out of a news conference.</p>
<p>The events are just part of the fallout in South Africa after the slaying of a notorious white supremacist. Eugene Terreblanche, leader of the once-feared AWB paramilitary group, was bludgeoned to death on his farm April 3. The acrimonious aftermath reveals strained race relations 16 years after apartheid collapsed and Nelson Mandela became president, urging all races to come together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not finished with you,&#8221; AWB Secretary General Andre Visagie shouted as he stormed off the local TV talk show, pointing a finger at a black female analyst. Video of the Wednesday night blowup, which erupted after the analyst continually interrupted Visagie and made hand gestures in front of his face, was posted on YouTube and quickly got hundreds of hits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Julius Malema, leader of the ANC Youth League, held a news conference in which he sang about beating up white farmers, defying a new directive from his own party to stop singing racially polarizing songs. Some whites have blamed Terreblanche&rsquo;s murder on a song Malema had previously belted out, urging that white farmers be shot.</p>
<p>{snip} But the aftermath of the Terreblanche killing, which was allegedly motivated by a wage dispute, shows that rage and wounds remain raw among many. Some residents of a black township near Terreblanche&rsquo;s farm even hailed Terreblanche&rsquo;s alleged killers as heroes.</p>
<p>Terreblanche&rsquo;s extremist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging movement, better known as the AWB, wanted to create all-white republic within South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does really highlight the fact that race relations in our country are an unresolved issue,&#8221; said Chris Maroleng, the journalist who was host of Wednesday night&rsquo;s TV show. &#8220;Eugene Terreblanche&rsquo;s death has opened up a lot of unhealed wounds and unresolved issues in terms of race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Visagie had become angry when analyst Lebohang Pheko kept interrupting him, asking &#8220;Is it still you versus us?&#8221; and whether he cared about starving South African children or abused farm laborers. Visagie tore the microphone from his jacket and threw it. Maroleng came between him and Pheko and warned: &#8220;Touch me on my studio and you will be in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>BBC television journalist Jonah Fisher said Malema himself lives in Sandton. Malema&rsquo;s eyes got big and he blew up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t come here with that white tendency .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. undermining blacks!&#8221; Malema shouted. He insulted Fisher&rsquo;s manhood, called for security officers to throw the reporter out and said: &#8220;Go out, bastard! You bloody agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malema has found an ear among poor black South Africans disenchanted that their right to vote has not been matched by access to decent housing, jobs, good education and health care. South Africa is the richest country in Africa, yet the ANC has been unable to translate that into better lives for the people.</p>
<p>Only a small black elite has become enormously rich since apartheid ended. Studies show the majority of blacks are worse off financially than they were under the white government.</p>
<p>&#8220;Race still matters very much in South Africa .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. particularly the coincidence between race and inequality, race and poverty and race and unemployment, with the black youth experiencing all those disproportionately,&#8221; said Justin Sylvester, a researcher at the Institute for Democracy in South Africa.<br>

<p>Yes, and the radical media thinks it&rsquo;s perfectly o.k. to call the murdered victim a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; and refrain from calling the opposition, who are singing songs about killing whites, &#8220;the opposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if the muddle-headed media ever once considered that supporting black murderers by blacks might amount to bias, or the accepted definition of &#8220;racism&#8221; today?</p>
<p>The greatest injustice on the planet today is that journalists aren&rsquo;t forced to live among the people they adore so much.</p>

		<p>Like it or not, South Africa is about to become an example of white separation is necessary and highly desirable for both whites and blacks.</p>
<p>As usual, it&rsquo;s the blacks making this choice.  No longer willing to tolerate whites when they aren&rsquo;t being dominated, I think South African whites are about to be forced either to leave the country or find they are tolerated in only specific areas.</p>
<p>It would have been better had they chosen themselves to concentrate their numbers but I think they are no longer going to be allowed the luxury of choice.</p>

		<p>Members of the AWB are always referred to as &#8216;White Supremacists&rsquo; whilst the highly inarticulate dangerous malema is the &#8216;Youth Leader&rsquo;. His sudden wealth came from several government contracts which just happened to come his way, well it wasn&rsquo;t because of his business acumen or experience, but there again, he qualifies because he&rsquo;s black. Those thousands of White football fans about to descend on South Africa flush with credit cards, cameras, cash, mobile phones, watches and a total naivety about black criminal brutality will soon realize exactly what malema is all about. An excellent spoof news programme from RSA actually tells it like it is, and I thoroughly recommend it.<br>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s time for the Whites to fight back with out and out gunfire violence, seems that is the only thing blacks anywhere understand and respect. Blacks DO NOT RESPECT courtesy, or manners, only ruthlessly applied force of arms. Here&rsquo;s a famous one &#8220;It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees. - Emiliano Zapata, Mexican Revolutionary.</p>

		<p>People need to learn that journalism does not equal truth. </p>
<p>The AWB Secretary General Andre Visagie should never have gone onto the show so soon after ET&rsquo;s murder. It&rsquo;s an emotional time and the TV station wanted to enforce the view that the AWB is a racist organisation. He fell for it hook, line and sinker..</p>
<p>As for Malema&hellip;the less said about this evil guy the better. He is going to be responsible for a lot of blood in the country. Another Che in the making&hellip;</p>

		<p>The reason why Zimbabweans are in South African is because criticising the government in Zimbabwe is a sure-fire way to get yourself imprisoned or killed. They hope that South Africa has Free Speech, but Malema has just proven otherwise.</p>

		<p>So what is the endgame for white South Africans?  Do many get killed and the rest end up leaving?  Do they miscegenate into the black population?  Do they concentrate in the Cape region in an effort to insure their safety?  Personally, I would leave if I were a white South African.  Probably to Australia or New Zealand.</p>

<p><br>
Yes indeed, Mr. Affirmative Action/Black Economic Empowerment TV-Star Man! It <i>also</i> opened up a lot of unhealed wounds in Eugene Terreblanche&rsquo;s head and body. So brutal was the bludgeoning (of a man who was <i>asleep</i> at the time!) that Terreblanche&rsquo;s friends had trouble identifying his corpse at the morgue. </p>

		<p>I saw the video clip, and I also agree that the white guy bought it hook, line and sinker.  He should have kept his cool, no matter how innane the woman was who kept interrupting him.</p>
<p>Did you notice the black guy trying to score points with false statements?  &#8220;Stop threatening this woman!&#8221;  The white guy only said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not finished with you.&#8221;  That is not a threat, especially in the context of the intellectual arguement that was going on.</p>
<p>Also, the black guy clearly put his hand on the white guy&rsquo;s arm without provocation and kept it there, all the while telling the white guy not to touch HIM!</p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they bring his badly beaten body to a funeral home, and show it with an open casket like they did in Chicago with Emmett Till?  Let the news pick up on it and maybe some minds could be changed, it is time to stand up to this brutality or die. There is no other choice.</p>

		<p>The strategy of the ANC here I believe is this: They know that there will be massive amounts of violent crime committed by black thugs against tourists during the upcoming World Cup. They can&rsquo;t do anything to stop it since black crime in South Africa is an unstoppable force of nature (as it is everywhere). So, they arrange for the two thugs to assasinate ET. They are hoping that the AWB and the Afrikaners retaliate violently in some way. <br>
Now, they will blame any crime committed against tourists during the World Cup as being the result of the &#8220;heightened racial tension&#8221; caused by the escalation of the crisis by the South African whites. The whole time the ANC and the Marxist press around the world will refer to LT as a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; when he was really a white separatist, and will refer to his followers as Nazis when they really are just white people who don&rsquo;t want to be murdered. </p>
<p>After the World Cup ends they will use the momentum from this episode to further disempower and oppress the whites. South Africa will be Zimbabwe in about ten years, if not sooner. But whereas 4 million of the 12 million blacks in Zimbabwe have been able to flee to their relatively propsperous neighbor, the tens of millions of new starving South African blacks will have nowhere to run to.</p>

<p>The news did pick up on Terreblanche&rsquo;s death  &mdash;  he was described as a White Supremacist and Nazi, inferring he &#8216;got what he deserved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is from an e mail I received from a South African White:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; I am on my way to the slain Eugene Terre&rsquo;Blanche&rsquo;s funeral. Thousands of Afrikaners are expected there, amid rumors that blacks are going to be bused in to confront us. Things could get very tense&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the BOLD HEADLINE from the UKs Daily Mail:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Nazi salutes and swastikas as hundreds gather for funeral of murdered white supremacist Eugene Terreblanche..&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet when black anti-apartheid activist Biko died under mysterious circumstances it was international, headline news:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Because of his high profile, news of Biko&rsquo;s death spread quickly, opening many eyes around the world to the brutality of the apartheid regime. His funeral was attended by over 10,000 people, including numerous ambassadors and other diplomats from the United States and Western Europe&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites hacked to death beyond recognition?  Elderly Whites and children raped and slashed?  </p>
<p>Nothing to report according to the world-wide msm!</p>
<p>Does anyone doubt that there is a world-wide War on Whites?</p>
<p>In America:  If you evil Whites don&rsquo;t hand over the country you founded and built and all of your wealth to non-Whites you are a racist, Nazi hater! </p>
<p>In England:  If you evil Whites deign to preserve your heritage, history, and the country you founded and have lived in for 10,000 years, vote for the BNP, and are against massive immigration from parasitic, White-hating muslims and africans, you are a racist, Nazi hater!</p>
<p>In SA:  If you object to being hacked to death by feral blacks you are a racist, Nazi hater.</p>
<p>Consider the msm an enemy to all Whites as they portray us in the most vile terms possible and promote our demise and destruction.</p>

<p>So once again we discover that race is real, not just the &#8220;construct&#8221; that liberals tell us it is? One also wonders why black youth suffer disproportionately in a country in which blacks are the majority, have the vote, have placed the radical ANC in power, have the privileges of affirmative action and BEE, have the support of the global liberal media, can hack Whites to death with impunity, and so forth and so on&hellip;</p>
