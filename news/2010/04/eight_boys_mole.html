			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fay Schlesinger, Daily Mail, April 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A gang of boys who molested a girl of 14 have escaped prosecution because it is &#8216;not in the public interest&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The eight, aged from eight to 12, sexually assaulted the teenager as she walked to a friend&rsquo;s house during the day.</p>
<p>For five minutes they &#8216;mauled her like animals&rsquo;, before she escaped.</p>
<p>A 14-year-old girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, and her mother have told of their outrage after the CPS decided not to pursue charges against her alleged attackers</p>
<p>Officers arrested the five boys aged over ten  &mdash;  the legal age of responsibility  &mdash;  and recommended charges.</p>
<p>But they are said to be furious after the Crown Prosecution Service refused to press charges, saying insufficient evidence meant it was not in the public interest.</p>
<p>It is thought it could prove hard to establish which of the boys, from Slovakian gipsy families, carried out different parts of the attack.</p>
<p>Last night the girl&rsquo;s 34-year-old mother condemned the authorities for failing to protect her daughter.</p>
<p>The mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said: &#8216;These dangerous little thugs are allowed to walk the streets.</p>
<p>&#8216;I shudder to think what will happen if they attack another girl. I&rsquo;m deeply disappointed with the CPS.</p>
<p>&#8216;Something has to be done, if only to deter these yobs from ever doing anything so despicable again. But they&rsquo;re going to be smug as hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s ordeal took place as she walked in the Hillfields area of Coventry at midday on January 6.</p>
<p>The boys, from local Romany migrant families who settled in the city in the late 1990s, threw snowballs at her to attract her attention before surrounding her.</p>
<p>They then touched her &#8216;all over&rsquo;, telling her she was pretty and saying they wanted her to be their girlfriend, she said.</p>
<p>West Midlands Police prepared a file for the CPS recommending charges be brought  &mdash;  but prosecutors refused.</p>
<p>CPS spokesman Patrick Noonan said: &#8216;The age of the alleged attackers is not a difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have spoken to the prosecutor concerned and they have gone through the evidence in detail and decided it is not in the public interest to prosecute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last night the girl described how she still suffers from nightmares and does not dare leave the house alone.</p>
<p>Her family have moved in with relatives at the other side of the city out of fear they will have to face the attackers again.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old, who wants to be a doctor when she is older, broke down as she said: &#8216;I still have nightmares and can hear them laughing and mauling me like animals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The CPS decision not to prosecute left her feeling as if she had not been believed, she added.</p>
<p>&#8216;I did nothing wrong but still feel like I&rsquo;m being treated like a liar,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;After what happened I get scared really easily.</p>
<p>&#8216;I can&rsquo;t even go out to meet my mates because I might bump into one of the people who attacked me.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m not really sure how I can move on from this. I&rsquo;m having to borrow my cousin&rsquo;s dog just to walk around because I don&rsquo;t feel safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>West Midlands Police sources said they were &#8216;frustrated&rsquo; by the decision after the girl &#8216;was brave enough to come forward&rsquo;.<br/>

		<p>Where&rsquo;s that other poster who was criticizing the Hungarian right wing party for wanting to expel gypsies, thinking it was unreasonable?  Any questions NOW, fella?<br/>
There is a reason most European nations distrust gypsies and force them to &#8220;move along&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Stories like this are commonplace all over Europe.  It is not &#8220;in the public interest&#8221; for the EU ruling elite to deal with Gypsy crime.  This would seem to explain the rise of the Hungarian Guard in Hungary.  Vigilantism is a natural response to a state&rsquo;s failure to perform it&rsquo;s primary duty.</p>

		<p>This comes just a week after four Afghan &#8220;teenagers&#8221;(their true ages are unknown) were released on bail having subjected a 13 year old girl to a horrific sexual assault at a swimming pool in Kent.The chances are that they have already disappeared into the &#8220;community&#8221;and like the Roma in Coventry will never face charges,and will remain in England indefinitely.</p>

They were ALL complicit in the attack, why would you need to prove which ones did what particular thing?</p>

		<p>So that&rsquo;s how you ask a Gysy girl out on a date. We must appreciate this as a cultural norm.  Perhaps it would help if white English women wore more loose and opened clothing so that they can ask them even better?</p>
<p>The first obligation of any government is to protect its people.  If that government admits or purposely imports people that regularly harm the native population, especially through violence, that government could be said to have failed.  How long will the English allow their government to fail them?</p>

		<p>What in the world is to be done with the Gypsies?  South Asia won&rsquo;t take them back, surely.  An intensive eugenics program?  Perhaps there is a sliver of that population that has high IQ and positive traits that can be the seed of a much-improved future version.</p>

		<p>It is a kind of religious belief today that ALL cultures are the same.  It is heresy to suggest that cultures can be radically different from each other and behaviors that are criminal in some cultures would be considered acceptable in others.  The West is in deep denial.</p>

		<p>In traditional gypsy culture, a young man kidnaps a young girl and has sex with her(consent is not necessary) and then they are considered married.</p>
<p>The only acceptable solution to the Gypsy problem is repatriation to India and/or Pakistan.  </p>

		<p>A Slovakian Joke:</p>
<p>The gypsies always protest for jobs, equality, etc. One day a cotton-headed Slovak runs into a protest with a load of gypsies carrying signs wanting jobs. Touched by liberal guilt, he sidles up to a gyspy and kindheartedly offers him some work for generous pay. The gypsy shunts off his offer, complaining, &#8220;Why the hell are you picking on me for?!&#8221;</p>

<p>In short, WHY selective discrimination? Were a Gypsy (Romany) female attacked in like manner by a group of White boys; count on the certainty it would be FRONT PAGE NEWS. Every idiot of a reporter, every minor official, getting into the act on behalf of the &#8220;poor minority victim.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Years ago I read an article in &#8220;GEO&#8221; magazine on the Gitanos, the Gypsies of Spain.  The author of the article, a flaky leftist, tried his best to impart some dignity to these people, yet laughably wound up scarcely concealing his contempt for them.  A quote in the article from a Gitana (Gypsy woman) said it all:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gypsies can be a real pain.  You know?&#8221;</p>
<p>By the way, Gitanas are overrepresented in the female prison population of Spain by at least a factor of 15!  Of course that&rsquo;s the White man&rsquo;s fault!</p>
<p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/files/projects/1998_119/int_gypsies_women_prison_in_spain.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/files/projects/1998_119/int_gypsies_women_prison_in_spain.pdf</a></p>
<p>The last paragraph from this article was telling.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to a survey cited by the report, 42 percent of the non-Gypsy Spanish respondents said they would not like to have Roma as neighbours, compared to 17.5 percent and 11.5 percent who would not want Moroccan or black African neighbours, respectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wherever they accumulate in sufficent numbers, Gypsies eventually raise the suspicions of the police and the ire of the locals.  What was true 100 years ago is just as true today.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-07-03-italy-fingerprinting_N.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-07-03-italy-fingerprinting_N.htm</a></p>

<p>It is well-documented that during the heydey of the Soviet Union, Gypsies were the only ethnic group freely allowed to leave.  This years before the Soviets allowed Jewish emigration.</p>
<p>Whiteplight is right: any government that would allow these obviously antisocial peoples into their borders is a failed government.</p>
