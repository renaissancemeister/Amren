<h1>Census Battling Fear, Confusion With Aid at Stake in Metro Detroit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Neavling, Detroit Free Press, April 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p><b>Most difficult places to tally</b></p>
<p>Darrel Davis, a panhandler who fetches crumpled dollar bills and recyclable cans off an I-75 exit in Detroit, pays no attention to the hype surrounding the decennial U.S. census.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you kidding? The census?&#8221; the 46-year-old asked, fumbling a hand-rolled cigarette. &#8220;I got bigger problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Dearborn, where a large Muslim population lives, Hasan Khalil said he&rsquo;s skeptical of the government after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and isn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;ll fill out his census form.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Metro Detroit is one of the most difficult places to tally because of the high number of lower-income people, immigrants, non-English speakers and others who fall into what the U.S. Census Bureau considers hard-to-count categories.</p>
<p>Hoping to combat fear, confusion and complacency surrounding the census, hundreds of volunteers and dozens of federal government employees and politicians are hitting the street with extra zeal this month to encourage everyone to be counted.</p>
<p>A lot is at stake  &mdash;  $400 billion a year. That&rsquo;s the amount the federal government sends to local communities based on demographics and population.</p>
<p>For each resident counted, about $1,400 returns to the community annually for education, health care, hospitals, roads and other services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2000, just 62% of Detroiters and 52% of Hamtramck residents  &mdash;  where many of the hard-to-count populations live  &mdash;  mailed back their census forms. In all of Michigan, 71% of residents returned census forms.</p>
<p>The return rate, as of Sunday, three days after the deadline for forms to be returned, was abysmal in lower-income areas of southeast Michigan, and in areas that are home to a large proportion of immigrants and African Americans, two other populations considered hard to count.</p>
<p>The return rates were 45% in Detroit, 39% in Hamtramck, 46% in Highland Park, and 51% in Ecorse, the lowest in southeast Michigan. The state average is 63%, despite a campaign blitz with billboards, block parties and TV, newspaper and radio ads.</p>

		<p>I read that the national return rate was 60% in 2000.  You&rsquo;ve got to wonder where the government got the information to fill in the gaps to complete the census.  My guess is they already have this information so why do they bother with the census?</p>

		<p>The purpose of the census is not to let the federal government know how much money it should hand out to which state.  It is to determine the allocation of representatives in the House.  Illegal immigrants should not get representation but our evil government insists upon counting them and giving them representatives anyway.</p>
<p>Our government should not be collecting tax money and then handing it out for health and education (and the only road building funds should be for interstate highways).  That money should be left at the state level.  The federal government prefers things this way because it can use the carrot of money (and the stick of holding it back) to demand obedience from the states on numerous issues that the federal government isn&rsquo;t supposed to handle under our constitution anyway.<br>

The census has become a money grab and illegals are feeding the frenzy.</p>
<p>These people need to look into the term diminished returns.</p>

<p>Knock, knock, excuse me Comrades!</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t Detroit be one of the most unproblematic places to tally, simply because nonwhite diversity (which is an<br>
unfathomable strength)is omnipresent there? I could see it being hard to count the mostly white outer suburbs, but the city and inner suburbs should be a piece of cake. </p>
<p>What am I missing here?</p>
<p>Oh, I know: God help us all!</p>

		<p>This new mayor of Dee, Bing, says that he HOPES that Dee will have a low return of the census forms. That will mean Dee will get LESS money from DC and Bing will then be able to justify cutting out programs that he feels are not needed and will allow him to balance the budget, etc.</p>
<p>The agony of Dee will only be prolonged by a greater return of the census forms?</p>
<p>And of course, just filling out the form is such a chore for some folks. So hard to do.</p>

		<p>  I just saw where they had a top ten list of the ten most hated companies in America. One was Chrysler and another one was GM. Is it a reason they are both based in Detroit. Wonder if they have the same union co-managing them. Also what are some of the other things the same about these two hated companies? Anybody have any ideas?</p>
