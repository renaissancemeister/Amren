	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} I think that people like me have unfair advantages that we rarely appreciate, and that everyone deserves the same advantages that I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to receive. But however idealistic I am, however commited I am to social justice, the fact remains: I am, to my shame, a racist.</p>
<p> 1. I am a racist  &mdash;  because I never noticed all of the unearned privileges that are given to me until someone pointed them out.</p>
<p> 2. I am a racist  &mdash;  because even after learning about the unearned privileges that I recieve, I still don&rsquo;t notice them.</p>
<p> 3. I am a racist, because I have grown up in a culture that, at every turn, teaches me that to be white is to be better, and smarter, and I have absorbed that lesson.</p>
<p> 4. I am a racist, because I instinctively react to members of minorities with fear.</p>
<p> 5. I am a racist, because I live in a sunset town.</p>
<p> 6. I am a racist, because I believe that I deserve the success I have, even though I know people who are more smart, capable, and talented than I am never had the chances that I did to be successful, because of the color of their skin.</p>
<p> 7. I am a racist  &mdash;  because I am a white man who has directly benefited from the unfair preferences that have been directed towards me all of my life.</p>
<p> 8. I am a racist  &mdash;  because every day, I benefit from the denial of basic privileges to other people.</p>
<p> 9. I am a racist, because I do not notice the things that are denied to people who are different from me.</p>
<p> 10. I am a racist, because I do not notice the advantages that I have over others.</p>
<p> 11. I am a racist, because even when I do manage to notice what is denied to people of different races and backgrounds, I don&rsquo;t speak up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People like me think of ourselves as the default  &mdash;  as &#8220;normal&#8221; people. We consider the incredible advantages that we receive to be normal, unremarkable. We don&rsquo;t notice just how much we benefit from that assumption of our own normality  &mdash;  the benefits we receive fade into invisibility. We don&rsquo;t even notice that they exist. And then when someone who doesn&rsquo;t get those benefits has trouble, we naturally blame them for not being as successful as we are.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I grew up in a wealthy town in NJ. We didn&rsquo;t consider ourselves wealthy  &mdash;  but by comparison to lots of other people, we really were. I went to a very good school system. We complained about it a lot: the textbooks were too old; the equipment in the science labs were too beaten up; the classes were too easy, and so on.</p>
<p>When I was in college, I got to teach a summer program for top students from schools in Newark, Camden, and Jersey City. And I discovered that my students went to schools where they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about their books being too old  &mdash;  because they didn&rsquo;t have any books. {snip} I didn&rsquo;t admitted to college over people from their schools because I was smarter. I got admitted into college over people from their schools because I was richer and whiter.</p>
<p>And when my students went to the campus bookstore to buy basic supplies like paper and pencils, the people who worked there followed them around the store  &mdash;  because what would a bunch of poor black kids be doing in a bookstore if they weren&rsquo;t there to rob it?</p>
<p>{snip} My parents paid for me to go to college  &mdash;  which gave me the time to take courses not just because I needed them to graduate, but because they covered things that I wanted to learn, just for fun.</p>
<p>How could a person from a family that just managed to scrape by, who lived in a school system that couldn&rsquo;t afford textbooks for the basic classes, much less the AP classes, how could they compete with me? It&rsquo;s damned close to impossible. Not because they&rsquo;re any less smart, or any less talented. But because I&rsquo;ve had an absolutely uncountable number of advantages. Every day of my life, I&rsquo;ve been given benefits which helped make it possible for me to become who and what I am. I&rsquo;m here partially because I&rsquo;ve worked damned hard to get here. But that work, by itself, wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten me to where I am, without luck and privilege.</p>
<p>People like me need to remember that. We didn&rsquo;t earn what we have all by ourselves. We may have earned part of it  &mdash;  but only part. An awful lot of what we have is built on privilege: on the advantages that we&rsquo;ve been given because of race, gender, wealth, and family.</p>

		<p>At first blush this guy is a pathetic wimp.  But on reflection I notice for all his wallowing in white guilt he hasn&rsquo;t volunteered to give up a nickel of his so called benefits.  So it turns out he is really nothing more than a mouthy hypocrite running down his fellow whites while doing nothing. Ultimately people like him are of little danger to us.  In fact if he had to actually live around blacks like the book store owners he bemoans, he would probably become one of us.</p>

		<p>Mr. Mark Chu-Carroll only has one method of recourse to jettison all the racism which he admits benefited him.  He has to let go of this most obvious benefit he has received from his white skin privilege.  He simply must quit his good job at Google as a software engineer, so that Google can give to to some corn-rowed ghetto denizen from Camden named N&rsquo;Deshawntavious.  Mr. Chu-Carroll just told us that he had a lot of unearned white skin privileges, and that the blacks of Camden and Newark are not &#8220;any less smart or any less talented.&#8221;  N&rsquo;Deshawntavious could do his job at Google just as well as he could.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon, Mr. Chu-Carroll.  Show that you&rsquo;re down with the struggle.  Prove your social justice chops.</p>

		<p>One thing that I missed at first   &mdash;   Mr. Chu-Carroll doesn&rsquo;t want to give up his chief item of unearned white skin privilege, his job.  But he does want to reconstruct the educational system around his views of &#8220;social justice.&#8221;  Conveniently, he is through with his own education, as he holds a Ph.D. </p>
<p>And you mean to tell me that Larry and Sergey tolerate one of their employees spouting this nonsense using GOOG&rsquo;s imprimatur?  Actually, I&rsquo;m not surprised, because as good as Larry and Sergey are with creating an internet search engine, that&rsquo;s how lame they are when it comes to politics.  If you ask me, Larry, Sergey and this Chu-Carroll character all suffer from a social form of Asperger Syndrome;  They can all outline the technical specs of every computer video accelerator card ever manufactured, and apply its ramifications to every video game code ever run through a compiler, but the most basic common sense applications of political reasoning seem to escape them, whereas they can write drivel like this with a straight face and a straight conscience.</p>

		<p>What kind of a name is Chu-Carroll? It sounds like he is part Chinese to me.  He is more like Obama then, being mixed race.  Well, I wonder what planet he lives on.  Whites have privileges just because of their skin color? Is that why those firemen in New Jersey had to appeal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court because they were denied promotions? Surely their superiors knew they were white and therefore should have been promoted for that reason and not because they passed civil service tests.  Hasn&rsquo;t Mark CC ever heard of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; policies that discriminate against white men because of their skin color and nothing else.  Bill Gates must not have heard of the White man&rsquo;s privilege either as his scholarship money only goes to non-whites.  If Mr. Chu-Carroll really feels so bad about his privileged background (I guess he has never met any working class whites) then he should have the good sense to commit hari-kari or something equivalent.  Maybe that&rsquo;s a bit drastic.  Why doesn&rsquo;t he quit that good paying job of his and become one of those guilty half-white social workers and go and live in the ghetto.  He should come to Chicago and move to the South or West sides of our great city.  He could make friends there, hang out in the bars, ride the subway in the wee hours for excitement.  Go Mark, go!</p>

		<p>What kind of a White man is named Chu-Carroll?  I&rsquo;m going to guess that he&rsquo;s married a Chinese woman (or male?) and taken a hyphenated last name, deferentially putting his mate&rsquo;s name first.  A major-league groveler, but, as 3 QD wrote, unwilling to give back any of the unearned privilege he bewails.  I pity his father.  Better a dead son than an emasculated, hypocritical flagellent.  </p>

		<p>Mr chu-carroll, I believe you&rsquo;d be more on target if you replaced the word racist with the words &#8220;brainwashed idiot&#8221; in your diatribe. </p>
<p>And as others have already posted here, why not put your job where your mouth is?? Im sure a capable minority could be found who could adequately do your job. Eventually. Or would you prefer that OTHER Whites make sacrifices for the betterment of minorities, so you can feel better about your &#8220;White privilege&#8221;?? </p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon Mr chu-carroll. What do you say? Show us you meant what you wrote. If you really believe the gibberish you penned, then resign from your job. After all if you had all the advantages, then you probably took a job that rightfully belongs to Leroy or Pedro. Time to make things right. </p>

		<p>Mr. Carroll stands on the shoulders of giants.  </p>
<p>He laments inherited privileges, but fails to give credit to his father and mother, who made life choices that provided him with a beneficial childhood home. His parents begin sacrificing for their offspring before they were even born.</p>
<p>From there, one could trace the author&rsquo;s family lineage back to pre-historic Europe, and appreciate the millions of choices and sacrifices that earned him his inherited opportunities.</p>
<p>During the same span of time when his ancestors were developing math, some other societies did not even adopt the use of the wheel.  Mr. Carroll is intellectually blind if he can&rsquo;t see the differences, and maliciously ungrateful and disrespectful if he is choosing to ignore them.</p>

		<p>It may come as a huge shock to Mr. Chu-Carroll to realize that those &#8220;unearned privileges&#8221; are EXACTLY why people build nations in the first place.  They WANT their offspring to benefit from the fruits of their societal cooperation and sacrifice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no different than the &#8220;unearned privilege&#8221; accrued to a person by benefit of their birth into a particular family.  Besotted with romantic idealism, many people like Chu happily imagine that anyone else could have, would have, should have been born into the privileged birth that they enjoyed - imagining that one&rsquo;s place of birth is a happy accident.</p>
<p>People who imagine thusly need to be slapped vigorously until they start to wake up and smell the coffee.  Our &#8220;unearned privilege&#8221; is NOT an accident of birth - it is the INTENDED result of our ancestor&rsquo;s sacrifice and effort.</p>
<p>An African bushman had no more chance of being &#8220;accidentally born&#8221; to Chu&rsquo;s parents than Chu had of being born to bushmen.  Instead of agonizing over his imagined good fortune, he should spend a few moments being GRATEFUL that his ancestors worked hard to prepare a better life for him than the bushmen did for their descendants.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have &#8220;unearned privilege&#8221;, he has unearned GUILT.</p>

<p>Allow me to edit the above sentence in the interest of conciseness and honesty:</p>
<p><i> I am a racist &mdash; because I am a white man.</i></p>
<p>There! That&rsquo;s better! See how easy that was?</p>
<p>This poor fool reminds me of the alcoholic who keeps insisting that he is swearing off alcohol forever  &mdash;  in between guzzles from and upturned whiskey bottle.</p>
<p><i>I discovered that my students went to schools where they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about their books being too old &mdash; because they didn&rsquo;t have any books.</i></p>
<p>Did they also have to do their homework on the back of a shovel? This kind of ridiculous argument might have flown in the 1930s or 1940s, but today&rsquo;s blacks have cell phones, iPods and Twitter accounts. Does he really expect us to believe that their schools can&rsquo;t afford basic necessities like books?</p>
<p><i>I am a racist &mdash; because every day, I benefit from the denial of basic privileges to other people.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a solution for you, Mr. Chu-Carroll. Move to Detroit so you can be surrounded by the people from whom you have denied these basic privileges. All of your whining rings hollow until then.</p>

		<p>The most successful ethnic group in per-capita earnings is Indians (from India).  No one talks about their &#8220;privileges.&#8221;  They have simply earned their way.</p>
<p>These so-called white &#8220;privileges&#8221; are also the wages of success.  The privileges everyone enjoys in the USA have overwhelmingly been created by the hard work of whites.</p>
<p>The soical justice movement is just another con job, a coverup for black failure.  It&rsquo;s time whites stood up to it and told blacks to do something on their own instead of being dependent on us.</p>

		<p>PS:  Has anyone noticed that these self-hating white liberals like him are very academically smart, and that they are a rarity in that sense?  Do they realize that most whites are NOT wealthy and privileged?  I&rsquo;d love to see him go up to some white blue collar workers who have families to support and say, &#8220;you did not earn that job or the money you have.&#8221;  He&rsquo;d probably be in the ER real quickly.  Hell, if he and other anti-white whites feel so bad about &#8216;white privilege&rsquo;, then why don&rsquo;t they give their jobs and assets to a non-whites?  </p>

		<p>This is really sad. This poor schmuck has really bought in to the idea that the only way he can be noble is to renounce everything that has helped him become who and what he is. When will people learn that to love your own race, civilization, culture and community doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to hate others? I wish white people would stop excluding the middle and realize that there are positions between rabid racist berserker and self-hating flagellant martyr. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;ve seen too many movies and TV shows and read too many articles and books telling them that to defend one&rsquo;s own way of life and to preserve and cherish one&rsquo;s own race and culture is tantamount to genocide.</p>

		<p>Notice at no point did he turn his back on &#8216;privilege&rsquo;. He used these privileges every way possible to get a computer science degree. He acted to get as far away from &#8216;diversity&rsquo; as it was possible for him to get. It would be so easy for him to give up his job. Even train his replacement. Plenty of whites have that experience for real. </p>

<p>Correct.  He was born Mark Carroll, married a Chinese woman named Jennifer Chu, and then changed his named to Mark Chu-Carroll.  In this post he explains why he did this.</p>

Here is the beginning part from the above weblink:<br>
&#8220;A sundown town is a town that is or was all white on purpose. The term is widely used in the United States and Canada in areas from Ohio to Oregon and well into the South. Even in Canada many towns in Southern Ontario, Alberta, and Quebec, were sundown towns prior to 1982, when it was outlawed. The term came from signs that were allegedly posted stating that people of color had to leave the town by sundown. They are also sometimes known as &ldquo;sunset towns&rdquo; or &ldquo;gray towns&rdquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>

Seriously though, how can anyone look at this and not see that this guy suffers from some sort of mental illness?  I really hope this guy is young enough to experience his complete marginalization within his field, as being Chinese or Indian is almost a prerequisite for employment in computer science these days.  I would really love to see him have to train his replacement and go from Phd Computer God to convenience mart cashier on the night shift.</p>

It&rsquo;s been said there&rsquo;s a fine line between genius and madness. I believe this is true.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu-Carroll likely looks around the office and sees a majority of white faces. He reasons that if he could make it, then anyone could and concludes that &#8216;racism&rsquo; is what keeps non-whites out of his profession.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu-Carroll (is this the son of a feminist?) has the acedemic and career credentials to be regarded as highly intellegent and yet he believes such nonsense.</p>
<p>Intellegent people can reason a position to an absurd conclusion. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of stupid, foolish White guilt-type screeds but this is one of the very worst  &mdash;  therefore, I suspect M. Chu-Carroll will shortly be receiving royalties as his diatribe is used in &#8216;diversity training&rsquo; sessions and educational professional developments (alongside the the odious jane elliot&rsquo;s blue/brown eyes exercise used to humiliate Whites as to our &#8216;unearned&rsquo; privileges). </p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I am a racist &mdash; because I never noticed all of the unearned privileges that are given to me until someone pointed them out&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Stop speaking in generalities and cut to the chase!</p>
<p>What &#8216;unearned privileges&rsquo; were pointed out to you?  Point them out to us.<br>
I&rsquo;d like three specific examples  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;ll be happy to counter with three examples of my own of blatant discrimination against Whites, and unlike you, I&rsquo;ll be specific, very specific.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I am a racist, because I instinctively react to members of minorities with fear&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Your instincts are keeping you alive, as Howard, poster#8, points out.</p>
<p>Let me point out to you a couple of FACTS from the FBI and Justice Dept.:  &#8220;Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery&hellip;Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have a young, beautiful White daughter, as I do, or other White loved ones do you tell them to be &#8216;non-racist&rsquo; and to ignore their instincts when around blacks?  Would you rather be called a Racist Nazi or keep your loved ones safe?</p>
<p>You can call me a Racist Nazi until &#8216;sundown&rsquo; if it means me keeping my loved ones safe by warning them of the dangers posed to us by vicious black criminals who target our people.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I am a racist &mdash; because I am a white man who has directly benefited from the unfair preferences that have been directed towards me all of my life&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What in the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>You have a lot of nerve writing such a specious lie when Whites are openly being discriminated against via anti-White AA preferences, quotas, college admissions, scholarships and promotions that lock us out in favor of lesser or unqualified blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>This is not in dispute; however, if I complain about this obvious injustice to Whites, I am called a bigot and hater.</p>
<p>Which White ethnic advocacy group can I call for redress, to stand up for my rights, Mr. Chu-Carroll, when I or any other White is denied college admissions, scholarships or promotion in favor of far lesser qualified blacks or hispanics?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;And I discovered that my students went to schools where they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about their books being too old &mdash; because they didn&rsquo;t have any books&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you for real?</p>
<p>The government, via Title I (which began in 1965), started specifically to &#8216;lift up the poor&rsquo; and &#8216;level the playing field&rsquo;, have showered trillions of dollars on non-White schools for 45 years now with nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>I should know, I worked in a Title I school for almost a decade and had all the new text books I could ever want (which were destroyed within a year)  &mdash;  also aides, field trips, outreach programs, the latest technology, classroom supplies, reams of paper, office supplies, supplemental materials, Kaplan SAT preparation classes (about $1,500/student) and more.  </p>
<p>My son&rsquo;s White school?  I have to pay for the supplies he needs for chemistry lab, art class, photography, supplemental textbooks for biology (the main one is outdated), any and all AP tests ($85 per test) and study guides, PSAT tests, SAT tests, ACT tests  &mdash;  things provided for free by Title I funds in non-White schools.</p>
<p>My daughter&rsquo;s college tuition?  I pay every penny of it, in full, including all living expenses and textbooks (some of which are $200).  You see, there are no scholarships or outreach programs specifically for my White children as there are for &#8216;underprivileged&rsquo; blacks and hispanics.  </p>
<p>Do you consider this White privilege?</p>
<p>I am not rich, even though the government thinks I am  &mdash;  must be that &#8216;White Privilege&rsquo; I keep hearing about from jerks like Mr. Chu-Carroll.</p>
<p>How about sharing with us, enlightening us, Mr. Chu-Carroll; tell us exactly what constitutes &#8216;White Privilege&rsquo; in this current Reign of PC terror directed at us Whites.</p>
<p>Because unlike you, I can&rsquo;t seem to find any trace of White Privilege.</p>

<p>I find it laughable to claim that any school in this day and age would not have textbooks, but so what? If they had them, which they probably did in truth, would they have read them, and learned from them? </p>
<p><i> I am a racist, because I have grown up in a culture that, at every turn, teaches me that to be white is to be better, and smarter, and I have absorbed that lesson.</i></p>
<p>Maybe because that is true to one extent or another, aside from the ability to breakdance or make up lies like not having textbooks? (see above)</p>
<p><i>I am a racist, because I live in a sunset town.</i></p>
<p>You could move&hellip;</p>
<p><i> I am a racist &mdash; because every day, I benefit from the denial of basic privileges to other people.</i></p>
<p>Like working for Google? Hey, I&rsquo;m denied that &#8220;privilege&#8221; too. Otherwise, what on earth is this guy talking about? You sound like you believe in a zero-sum game economic reality, where I can only have something at the expense of someone else not getting the same something. That&rsquo;s not the way the real world works.</p>

		<p>This is the kind of a White guy that is helping to lead us to extinction.  However he does seem to be the typical so-called &#8220;liberal&#8221;.  I noticed his name is &#8220;Chu-Carroll&#8221;.  As #6 astutely pointed out it&rsquo;s probably the name of his Chinese wife, that he&rsquo;s chosen to include as HIS last name just so he doesn&rsquo;t appear sexist.  I assume he wants everyone to KNOW that he&rsquo;s married to an Oriental too.  &#8220;See guys, look at me.  Look how politically correct I am.  Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful that I&rsquo;m so &#8220;with it&#8221;?  I&rsquo;m in with the In-crowd&#8221;.  What a pathetic groveling, weakling.

<p>I was in one of these diversity classes in school. In our case they had a group of Muslim boys come in so we could be &#8216;educated&rsquo; about their culture, and we could ask them questions. I remember being a bit leery of the whole thing. Our teacher wouldn&rsquo;t put up with that, saying, &#8220;diversity is about tolerance, period&#8221;. You have to remember, though, after 30 years of diversity training these very same folks use the word, &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;, a racial slur, in an effort to prove to everyone else how enlightened they are.   </p>

		<p>So, I guess its been cleared up about Mark&rsquo;s name, that is he changed it to Chu-Carroll to show that his wife is his equal(I guess).  It might not be a bad idea to invite him to speak at the next American Renaissance annual meeting.  I&rsquo;d go to that one if I had to travel 5,000 mile in the dead of winter, just to gaze upon this self-hating white man.  If in fact he is.  I think a psychiatrist would have a &#8216;field&rsquo; day with this idiot.  He may have an IQ off the charts but he surely is deficient in his knowledge of how the majority of white people live.  I had the opportunity when I was nineteen years old to travel around the United Stataes and saw how most people worked and lived.  This was in the 1950&rsquo;s and of course it was a different country then.  Not like the one this Mark Chu-Carroll inhabits.  What white privilege is he talking about? Most white males didn&rsquo;t go to college but there were many, many jobs available because we were the industrial giant in those days.  My sales territory was Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and up to Ft. Walton,Florida.  Of course I only came into contact with working people, so I never met any of the elites such as Mark CC until later on in life.  I surely didn&rsquo;t meet them when I was drafted into the US Army.  I don&rsquo;t think Mark would last a day in the armed forces.  Why, he would rather put a bullet in his brain then have to mix with the common white working class.  Yeah, it would be worthwhile to invite Mark to speak at the next AR convention(if its allowed).  The scary thing thought is that the Mark&rsquo;s in this country are the ones with the most clout.  That has to stop.</p>

		<p>It should read, &#8220;I&rsquo;m a classist because I grew up with money privileges denied to most of humanity and, instead of recognizing my class privilege and the advantages it gave me over poor white people and other poor people, I ignore my class advantages and pretend my white skin gave me a leg up. This, in turn, makes all my fellow white people appear as privileged as I am, even though most of them aren&rsquo;t. And this, in turn, breeds hatred against poor whites.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What White privilige? Did this man ever think about what Whites as a whole or his ancestors went through to give him his opportunities. Look at the sufferings of Europeans over the centuries, the wars, diseases, famine and everything else. Europeans worked hard, created and invented to build Europe into what it is today and what Europeans enjoy today. What about the Europeans who came to America, Canada and Australia. Most of them came to a mostly empty land and through hard, hard work built these countries up. How many men and women pioneers died settling the USA? The West is littered with their bodies. It wasn&rsquo;t at all easy to build American, Canada or Australia up either, it took a lot of blood, sweat and tears by his White ancestors. This Mr. Chu-Carroll&rsquo;s direct ancestors would have had to have immigrated, likely with little and struggled to build up a life far across the ocean in America by hard work and each generation making sacrifices, including his parents, so that he is where he is today. Nobody handed Whites anything.</p>

		<p>Dear Mr Chu,<br>
You sir, are a coward. You have no substance. You are a disgrace and an embarrasment to all good, decent, hardworking white people out there. You are a racist - you don&rsquo;t get to bring our race down because you feel guilty. In fact, I fire you from the white race. You are now a non-race - you are now free to pick your new hood. You are also fired from Google - a company built by white technology and white brains. Shocking that you think you can unleash your putrid thoughts and then get like-minded libtards to beat their breast in horror at being a member of the white race. You need to get a life. There are more important things to be sorry and guilty for than being sorry and guilty for being white. You are fired!</p>

Therefore isn&rsquo;t a person who isn&rsquo;t &#8216;racist&#8221; by definition &#8220;neurotic&#8221;? Furthermore, Mr. Chu-Carroll&rsquo;s guilt is a fashionable facade, as others have noted. He is apparently unwilling to give up his so-called &#8220;racial privileges&#8221;, like his high-paying job, in spite of all of his self-proclaimed racial guilt, but is undoubtedly more than willing to trade away yours and mine.

One can easily dissect and refute each and every one of the 11 points.  (Except I admit to not having a clue what #5 means.)  Let me focus on #7, replacing the word &#8220;white&#8221; with &#8220;black&#8221;:</p>
<p>7. I am a racist &mdash; because I am a black man who has directly benefited from the unfair preferences that have been directed towards me all of my life.</p>

<p>Hilarious. He&rsquo;s gotten 170 comments and, as of this writing, 3,951,778 hits to this blog post, according to the &#8220;site meter&#8221; at the bottom of his page. I wish anything I wrote got that much attention. But I guess it&rsquo;s proof positive that if you write something provocative, you will manage to provoke people. But at least he got plenty of clicks (one would guess) to his blog ads for Haiti earthquake relief and the Oreck air purifier.</p>
<p>As far as the term &#8220;sunset town&#8221; I agree that it must have been invented relatively recently. I&rsquo;ll bet one could search the literature in vain for any reference to it before the current &#8220;politically correct&#8221; era. Another case of historical revisionism in action.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out that, entirely aside from the idiocy of their content, several of Mrs. Chu&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s &#8220;I am a racist&hellip;&#8221; confessions make essentially the same point. After confession #7, there is no meaningful difference between all subsequent points: they are merely reiterations of the same (nonsensical) idea. Mrs. Chu&rsquo;s husband is repeating himself to make his list longer. </p>
<p>Other posters have rightly described Mrs. Chu&rsquo;s husband in terms of masochism and self-flagellation. And this silly screed does indeed read as though the author is whipping himself for each of his (however unwitting) racist transgressions. But I&rsquo;ll bet that if he were somehow forced to flog himself across the back for each of his litany of confessions, he&rsquo;d soon find a way to edit out all the redundant and superfluous points on his risible laundry list of purported caucasian nefariousness. </p>

		<p>My impression is that &#8216;Chu-Carroll&rsquo; is indulging in self-service disguised as self-flagellation.  This piece will get him noticed at Google: the same Google that censors what I can find on nonwhite violence against whites, and which, I am told, has an anti-white agenda.</p>
<p>Too, his little manifesto could be used in a textbook, as an example of Narcissist thinking.  Narcissists love to be heroes. And they love to portray themselves as models of humility. But they also love to hurt, derogate, and disadvantage others&hellip;.usually &#8216;others&rsquo; whom they perceive as competition&hellip;in this case, the competition being other whites.</p>
<p>Then again, I could be wrong.  Possibly, what we&rsquo;re viewing is a manifestation of Histrionic Personality Disorder (with a healthy dollop of Asperger&rsquo;s thrown in for extra flavor).</p>

		<p>This anti-White racist screed is written without a shred of proof; therefore, I fully expect Mr. Chu-Carroll to soon reap royalties as diversity trainers and professional development corporations incorporate his into their indoctrination programs.</p>
<p>I found the entire article offensive, with this being the most specious:</p>
<p>&#8216;&hellip;.I discovered that my students went to schools where they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about their books being too old &mdash; because they didn&rsquo;t have any books&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>Since 1965, via Title I funds, the government has showered trillions of dollars on &#8216;underperforming schools&rsquo; (read black and hispanic) to &#8216;level the playing field&rsquo; and &#8216;deliver parity with (so-called) rich schools&rsquo; and &#8216;close the achievement gap&rsquo;  &mdash;  with nothing to show for it, the achievement gap being as wide as ever.</p>
<p>These funds continue apace and have been increased:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Annual appropriations for Title I have increased by 60 percent, accounting for inflation, since 1994&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I should know, I worked in one such school for almost a decade.  Title I funds (when they didn&rsquo;t disappear completely) were used to fund new textbooks every single year (because either a &#8216;new, improved&rsquo; educational theory was being implemented or the books were completely destroyed every year by &#8216;underprivileged&rsquo; students who &#8216;didn&rsquo;t have books&rsquo;).  </p>
<p>I would like Mr. Chu-Carroll to point out specific examples of White privilege because in the current PC Reign of Terror against Whites, I sure can&rsquo;t find even a single one. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had some time to think about this, and I&rsquo;m starting to think that this Chu-Carroll and his rantings aren&rsquo;t totally above board.  He might be a poseur or a deliberate bravo sierra artist.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I found a story on a neo-con website, about a high school math teacher from suburban Boston who wrote a Letter to the Editor of the <i>Boston Globe</i>, stating that his opposition the 2nd Amendment was so pure and genuine that he would rather bury his child rather than engage in a &#8220;gun crime&#8221; to defend his child against a mugger.  I blogged about it.  One of my readers e-mailed me some links to some 2nd Amendment forums and message boards, where they presented some evidence to show that this math teacher was deliberately saying these things in public, because he&rsquo;s really pro-2nd and a gun owner (they had anecdotal evidence suggesting as such).  The consensus was that he feared for his job in ultra-left Boston in even more left-wing public school system, so he was way overcompensating for guilt in a fraudulent way.  The posters on those msg boards also implored us to use our common sense   &mdash;   liberals can be crazy, but there&rsquo;s nobody who can be THAT crazy and self-flagellating.</p>
<p>I think this Chu-Carroll might be doing the same thing.  I see a lot of the same ridiculous and obviously too-crazy-to-be-true self-flagellation, and, just with this math teacher, assuming everything said about him being pro-2nd and a gun owner are true, Chu-Carroll won&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t jettison his own privileges.  Ergo, he&rsquo;s a poseur.</p>

		<p>The man is an utter idiot, deceived really. His self-flagellation is an abomination and an insult to the creative force that made him. He doesn&rsquo;t see his state as something that is powerful and can be used in thousands of beneficial ways, rather he sees his state as something limited and degrading to himself and others. He throws his wholeness, his good fortune at being of sound mind and body, in his creators face. Nothing is more foolish than false modesty. It impresses no one, and neither should it. All great athletes, explorers, men of letters,etc.,now and in the past, could never have accomplished the things they did, with such an enervating philosophy of life. Were he not living in a relatively peaceful nation, but rather in a violent dog eat dog atmosphere, where his survival was at stake, I believe he would appreciate an alternative point of view. In truth, this guy is a &#8220;self&#8221; possessed moron that needs to get out more and see what life is actually like.</p>

<p>Imagine that there had been no native Americans here that we white people so evilly stole from? </p>
<p>Would today&rsquo;s America be significantly poorer or somehow worse off?</p>
<p>Imagine that blacks from Africa had never been imported to this country as slaves, and used for the past few hundred years as cheap labor.</p>
<p>Would today&rsquo;s America be significantly poorer or somehow worse off?</p>
<p>I think everyone intuitively knows the answer to these questions. Of course not - America would have prospered and probably not looked much different than it does today.</p>
<p>The notion that all white families are benefitting today from the work a relatively small number of blacks did a couple of hundred years ago is utter nonsense.</p>

<p>Ethnicity and mariage can explain a lot.  So now we know about the name &#8220;Chu&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m curious about the rest of his family background (which no one has thus far addressed).  &#8220;Carroll&#8221; is a common Irish last name, but &#8220;Mark&#8221; is not. So his father was (probably) Irish; but who was his mother? That may be the key. And where did he get those far-leftish notions? (Not likely from his father, I&rsquo;d guess.)<br>

<p><br>
Correct. And yet look at Mrs. Chu&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s statement   &mdash;   which is clearly in the PRESENT tense:</p>
<p><i>5. I am a racist, because I live in a sunset town.</i></p>
<p>This implies that his town is STILL a sunset town. Which, as Poster #89 notes, hasn&rsquo;t been legal or practised in <i>almost half a century.</i> </p>
<p>That makes Mrs. Chu&rsquo;s husband not just a nitwit but a LIAR. </p>
<p>Mrs. Chu&rsquo;s husband would probably argue that he meant it metaphorically: that &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; by police is, for blacks, a de facto version &#8220;sunset laws.&#8221; You know: the way blacks called the OJ Simpson case a &#8220;modern day lynching,&#8221; etc. In other words, pure hyperbole. Okay, not quite <i>pure</i>: hyperbole plus blood libel. </p>
<p>But then, where Mrs. and Mr. Chu live, &#8220;sunset laws&#8221; would be irrelevant, as there are probably no blacks or browns near them anyway. </p>

		<p>Mr. Chu-Carroll is no doubt the product of miscegenation, between an oriental and a European. Strangely, though, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to feel shamed by Chinese racism, which is as about as insensitive and automatic as any form of racism in the world. Whites are the only people forced into sensitivity regimes to learn of their evil ways; but if Chu-Carroll were so bright as some seem to think, he should have been able to extend the attitudes with which he has been indoctrinated into his other half.</p>

<p>Consider:  (1) neither mother&rsquo;s name is reflected in either &#8220;Chu&#8221; or &#8220;Carroll&#8221;; (2) if they have a child who marries another good liberal, what will the child do - be called &#8220;Chu-Carroll-Burns-Yang&#8221;?

<p>I recognize the  reference. I have heard tales of such towns, over the years, but I never personally knew of any. Too bad that no specifics are ever given! I wonder is this is just another of those vague, unfounded urban myths that take root somewhere and just grow on their own.   I am in my 70s, and I have lived and traveled  all over the South   &mdash;   the Deep South   &mdash;   during the time of segregation, and I never saw of knew of any such town. It would be nice if people such as he could get more specific about such allegations. Of course, they never do!  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not prepared to say that such a town never existed (there might even have been a few rarities that had such a sign posted at the city limits), but I can only say (as someone who lived and traveled during that era) that I never saw or knew of any. It certainly was not common, to say the very least.</p>
<p>Now, like the inflated lynching tales that grow with time, it&rsquo;s casually talked about by those such as he (who were never there) and we&rsquo;re expected to take it for granted   &mdash;    even for places like New Jersey!  I never saw anything such in Louisiana; but New Jersey? That&rsquo;s stretching the imagination.</p>

		<p>Maybe dabbling in the artificial reality of the computer world allows a disengagement from the visceral reality of being a complete man. I&rsquo;ve often brought up the word &#8216;Identity&rsquo; because I think its one of the more vulnerable aspects of being a person in this rapidly morphing modern world. The line between fantasy and reality is allot more vague than it used to be before technology became so refined. And before technology allowed us such insulated, material dependent lives. If reality was one endless university, Mr.Chucarrol&rsquo;s dream of an androgynous, raceless, advantageless utopia would be just peachy, like creamy peanut butter in all directions, but not everyone shares his fantasy. On top of this I sense that Sado Masochism is likely the single most common denominator that ties the left together. The extreme left seems to have a sort of sickness in which it feeds on the miasma of its own decay&hellip; a kind of auto-cannibalism,&hellip; a bunch of nerds eating tofu imploding on each other. </p>

		<p>Years ago I had the opportunity to meet Sam Francis at a meeting sponsored by Chronicles magazine.  Anyway we talked about affirmative action policies and how they discriminated against white males in particular.  I told him I couldn&rsquo;t understand why the white elites in government and academia didn&rsquo;t &#8216;[go to bat&rsquo; for the white working class as they should.  He told me that these white elites such as Chu-Carroll despise the white working class and the middle class too.  I&rsquo;m sure now that most of the people that have posted comments would have to agree with the late Sam Francis.  It is evident that we won&rsquo;t see an end to these racist policies unless we get white men into Congress who will put a stop to makikng us second class citizens in our own country.  We do need a third political party as we can expect no such changes from either Democrats or Republicans.  I do hope that young white males become organized and demand these changes before donning a military uniform to end up being cannon fodder for another neo-con war.  Let them take the likes of the Chu-Carrolls of this country.</p>

		<p>The way I see it, self-hating white anti-racists should practice what they preach. Instead, they demand that average white people make the sacrifices. </p>
<p>Whites who advocate affirmative action or reparations ought to be the <b> first </b> people to give up their jobs/money to non-whites. However, I highly doubt that Robert Jensen or other anti-racists will give up their jobs or money to anyone. Instead, we&rsquo;re supposed to give everything up. </p>
<p>Whites who advocate integration should be the <b> first </b> people to send their kids to majority black schools in Detroit. However, Teddy Kennedy sent his kids to private schools (in addition to giving us that wonderful 1965 immigration act). </p>
<p>Whites who scream about whites benefiting from housing discrimination against blacks should be the first to give up their homes to blacks who were clearly excluded. However, I don&rsquo;t see Tim Wise giving up his house anytime soon.</p>
<p>Nope. White anti-racists who champion non-whites will always be the last to make the sacrifices they demand that we make. While they go around lecturing us (and in many cases, making handsome livings), they won&rsquo;t actually give up their jobs, money, and houses. However, even after rendering themselves homeless, penniless, and jobless, they&rsquo;ll still be tainted by &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anti-racism is a mental disorder. </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t understand why people like Chu-Carroll hate on old textbooks.  You told us that California&rsquo;s standard textbooks in the 1960s called the war from 1861-5 &#8220;War Between the States,&#8221; covered the South&rsquo;s side of the story, and literature texts even put in a good word for Robert E. Lee, and glorified Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s writings that would be considered extremist and insurrectionist today.  </p>
<p>Phyllis Schlafly&rsquo;s rule of thumb is that if the textbook is before 1970, you can generally trust it.  After, you can&rsquo;t.  And, like you say, they get screwier every year.</p>

		<p>The following is a paragraph from Mr Chu(?)-Carroll&rsquo;s blog from the link provided by &#8216;24  &mdash;  Anonymous&rsquo; on why he had chosen his wife&rsquo;s name &#8216;Chu&rsquo; to proceed his own family name of Carroll. </p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;<b>Let&rsquo;s take a look at genetics for a moment</b>. My parents recently went on vacation, and brought back gifts for my children. One of the gifts was a set of pens with their names on them. Give a new pen and a stack of paper to a three year old boy, and what do you think that he would do?<br>
My three-year-old son took the pen apart. He&rsquo;d never seen a &#8220;click&#8221; pen before, and he wanted to know how it worked.&#8221; </p>
<p>Maybe this is the reason for the Grand Dragon Mark &#8220;I am a racist&#8221; Chu Carroll&rsquo;s &#8216;White privilege&rsquo;.<br>
Maybe his ancestors created opportunities for themselves?</p>
<p>Maybe his way of paying reparations could be to find a smarter and brighter Indian computer programmer to take his place, but as we know the way these guilty, gutless liberals usually prefer to work is to offer a place that is not theirs to a non White, to displace a nameless White kid instead. <br>

<p>   I grew up in a small town in central Kansas, where I was told as a child that there was an unwritten law of mysterious origin that any black person setting foot within the city limits would have to be gone before sunset. This was often cited woefully in the course of my indoctrination in the left-liberal pieties in regard to race. It was not until I was in college that I learned that in the late 1800&rsquo;s a group of black soldiers stationed at a nearby fort went on the rampage when one of their fellow blacks was involved an altercation with a white sergeant and was shot. The blacks burned down half the town and raped and murdered many people. I had always wondered why my Volga-German friends were so &#8220;racist,&#8221; when they had never known a black person. At the time of the incident, the Volga German immigrants were just beginning to establish themselves in the community. My friends&rsquo; great-grandparents, having experienced a horror, had handed down their &#8220;racism&#8221; to their descendants.</p>

&#8220;as of this writing, 3,951,778 hits to this blog post, according to the &ldquo;site meter&rdquo; at the bottom of his page&#8221;.</p>
<p>The fact that this guy works at Google would make me very suspicious of that big site meter no.<br>
I attended a seminar once where the speaker shared a job hunting a trick he&rsquo;d do as to electronically &lsquo;stand out&rsquo;. He would &lsquo;copy and paste&rsquo; all of the exact text of a specific job advertisement &#8216;word for word&rsquo; and then format the text down to the smallest size possible, and then change the font colour of the text to match the document background colour making it invisible to the human eye, so when the H.R. rep would do a search engine search for specific &#8216;keywords&rsquo;, all of their own words and phrases would pop up from within this guys resume, putting him on the top of the &#8216;search&rsquo; pile.<br>
I can only imagine what tricks a senior programming engineer at Google would know re getting this math blog millions of hits.</p>
<p>On a personal note, in my twenties I used to live with a bunch of guys like this Chu-(whatever) fellow. My flatmates were all really well educated, math inclined, programmer guys who were a incidentally a lot more race realistic than this guy, but that&rsquo;s not my point.<br>
They were &lsquo;so smart,&rsquo; that I found them to be dumb in many ways.<br>
They were very &lsquo;nice guys&rsquo;, cats in fact, super intelligent but lonely guys who for the record couldn&rsquo;t attract woman no matter how much they tried.<br>
I&rsquo;m sure woman could smell their analytical way of looking at the world (low testosterone levels maybe) and as a consequence gave them a wide berth. One of these guys I&rsquo;m thinking about has also gone on to marry and breed with a full blood Chinese girl himself actually. <br>
In his case she was about the best he could&rsquo;ve hoped for too, as the offers were pretty thin but in saying that, I sense she&rsquo;ll be there for the long haul though (I&rsquo;m not condoning their union, just saying). <br>
On the they&rsquo;re &ldquo;so smart they were dumb&rdquo; observation,  I remember witnessing them many a time over planning a task to the point of being very impractical and frankly useless, be it when shopping, moving house, trying to drive rented three tonne truck or doing manual labour etc. <br>
Made me think that on one extreme there must be &lsquo;pure doers&rsquo; and on the other there are &lsquo;pure thinkers&rsquo;, but the bulk of the work in this world must get done by those people who live in between these extremes.  <br>
I see the key attributes of the three largest and most basic racial groups as Black being the doers, Asians being the thinkers and us White being the combination of the two.<br>
I personally have always been proud of how us Whites are that combination of &lsquo;b***s and brains,&rsquo; as opposed to being either one of those other two extremes alone.  <br>

It&rsquo;s only been within the last decade (or less) that I&rsquo;ve heard the phrase &#8216;sunset town&rsquo; and been informed by the anti-haters what it meant.</p>
<p>It struck me as odd that I&rsquo;ve never heard this term before but all of a sudden, it enter the lexicon of the left.</p>
<p>If these signs had existed, why weren&rsquo;t they saved or at least photographed by the anti-racists long before this?</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t doubt that there were towns that had such an unspoken policy, wouldn&rsquo;t we have seen these signs that were allegedly posted in these towns?</p>
<p>This has shades of the &#8220;No Irish Need Apply&#8221; signs that have never been found in the US:</p>
<p>&#8220;The 1862 song, &#8220;No Irish Need Apply&#8221;, was inspired by NINA signs in London. Later the song was adapted by Irish Americans to include their experiences as well. The issue of job discrimination against Irish immigrants to the United States is a hotly debated issue among historians, with some insisting that the &#8220;No Irish need apply&#8221; signs so familiar to the Irish in memory were myths, and others arguing that not only did the signs exist, but that the phrase was also seen in print ads and that the Irish continued to be discriminated against in various professions into the 20th century.&#8221;</p>

The blacks burned down half the town and raped and murdered many people.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Ah, I can see it now!  There is rich material for the next TV series or documentary about the heroic black soldiers in Kansas who, driven to the end of their patience, finally stood up to white racism and brutality and demanded their human rights and an end to the unspeakable abuses they had suffered.  </p>
<p>Of course, the President will award medals to their descendents and hold a solemn ceremony on the White House lawn asking their forgiveness.  (Perhaps with compensation.)  Another great occasion for breast-beating and apologizing &hellip; on our part, that is. </p>
<p>What a movie it would make!  Are you listening, Hollywood?<br>

<p>I rescued those old textbooks years ago  &mdash;  in the late 80s, before the book depository was closed to drones like me and then closed permanently.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen an old &#8216;authentic&rsquo; textbook in years.  If you have one or a few pre-1970 texts, guard them as you do your St. Gaudens  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m guessing those old un-PC texts from the depository were burned at 451 degrees fahrenheit . </p>
<p>You may be prosecuted at some point for owning old texts, required to surrender  them as you would any gold or guns you might own, as they are considered subversive today.</p>
<p>Imagine teaching diverse, multi-cultural American children that this country was founded and created by Whites!  If jerks like chu-carroll prevail, you will be jailed for uttering such a hateful notion.  Everyone knows the Founding Fathers were racist, genocidal slave holders who stole the Constitution from the peaceful Iroquois nation and then claimed they had written it!</p>
<p>This is what the current high school texts teach our children.  </p>
<p>Destroying our history, denying our achievements and indeed erasing our past is part of the on-going War on Whites.</p>
<p>There should be enough Asians here by now to keep the electrical grid going after we&rsquo;ve been eradicated. Do I think it will come to that?  Yes. </p>
<p>And finally to Anon #101&rsquo;s well-written post:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Teddy Kennedy sent his kids to private schools (in addition to giving us that wonderful 1965 immigration act)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The ultra-hypocritical ted kennedy did indeed send his kids to exclusive private schools while demanding that YOUR precious White children be bused into violent black schools in dangerous neighborhoods in the name of integration.</p>
<p>The 1965 immigration act (Cellar-Hart, NOT kennedy) was fronted by kennedy, he ushered it through congress, but was too drunk and unintelligent to write it, didn&rsquo;t understand what its purpose was and in fact promised:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;[O]ur cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually&hellip;. the present level of immigration remains substantially the same &hellip; Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Those who authored the bill made no such promises:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Senator Jacob Javits played a prominent role in the Senate hearings on the 1965 bill. Javits authored an article entitled &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s open the gates&rsquo; that proposed immigration levels of 500,000 per year for 20 years with no restrictions on national origin.</p>
<p>Congressman Emanuel Celler, who fought for unrestricted immigration for over 40 years in the House of Representatives, introduced similar legislation resulting in the &#8216;Cellar-Hart Immigration Bill,&rsquo; the precursor to the fatal bill of 1965&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>All the best to you! (is John PM demanding royalties yet?)</p>
<p>Bon</p>
