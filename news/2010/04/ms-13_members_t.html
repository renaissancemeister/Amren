<h1>MS-13 Member&rsquo;s Trail Shows Gang&rsquo;s Movement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jana Wagoner, Loudon Times (Leesburg, Va.), March 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sixty years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how long Antonio Neftali Urrutia-Barrera, 20, of Reston, will spend in federal prison after being sentenced March 19 for two of the many crimes he either committed or is accused of committing in late summer and early fall 2008.</p>
<p>One of those crimes was a triple shooting in Sterling Park that left a Loudoun resident paralyzed from the waist down.</p>
<p>During a period of a little more than two months, Urrutia-Barrera  &mdash;  who is in the country illegally from Central America  &mdash;  spent time in three Virginia counties and one Maryland county.</p>
<p>His crimes left at least four innocent bystanders injured. They also highlight how gangs sometimes work in one area for months and then move to a new region as members try to elude capture. While law enforcement has begun to curtail MS-13 crime in Northern Virginia, according to a 2009 FBI report, the gang has spread into southern Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia.</p>
<p>Urrutia-Barrera&rsquo;s crimes were committed while the gang was more active in Loudoun and Fairfax.</p>
<p><strong>A violent beginning<br>
</strong><br>
Federal court documents say Urrutia-Barrera, also known as &#8220;Lil Duende,&#8221; joined MS-13 as an associate member in 2006 at the age of 16. He was jumped in as a full member in 2008 when he was 18. Jumping in is a ritual in which three current MS-13 members kick and punch an associate member for 13 seconds to initiate him or her as a full member.</p>
<p>Once he became a full member, it didn&rsquo;t take Urrutia-Barrera long to get involved in attacking people he perceived to be members of the 18th Street gang, MS-13&rsquo;s rival.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Urrutia-Barrera has been convicted of two attacks in Loudoun County in 2008, the more violent attack of the two happened Sept. 17.</p>
<p>Court documents say that Urrutia-Barrera and other MS-13 members were drinking in Sugarland Run that night when they decided to go to the home of another MS-13 member to continue the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before everyone left, a leader in the clique handed a .38 revolver to [Urrutia-Barrera],&#8221; the documents say.</p>
<p>While sitting in the front passenger seat, Urrutia-Barrera thought he saw a group of 18th Street members at the entrance of Buckingham Court in Sterling Park.</p>
<p>Urrutia-Barrera&rsquo;s group entered Buckingham Court, and as they drove out, Urrutia-Barrera pulled out the revolver and shot at the group, wounding three.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Later that night, an MS-13 praised Urrutia-Barrera for the shootings.</p>
<p>After an Oct. 6 attack in Reston that left two men injured with gunshot wounds, Urrutia-Barrera spent several days, possibly a week at an MS-13 leader&rsquo;s home in Maryland.</p>
<p>Then, at the suggestion of one of the NLS leaders, he fled to Richmond and stayed in a hotel room with a fellow MS-13 member, court documents say.</p>
<p>While in Richmond, Urrutia-Barrera participated in what police called the most violent MS-13 act the region had seen up to that point.</p>
<p>He and fellow gang members saw a man in a restaurant/night club in Chesterfield County who they mistakenly identified as an 18th Street gang member.</p>
<p>They followed the man into the restroom and stabbed him five times, once in the heart. The man survived but lost partial use of a hand and has several scars.</p>
<p>Urrutia-Barrera was convicted of malicious wounding in the case and is serving state time for it. </p>

		<p>By some accounts I&rsquo;ve read, there are about 20,000 MS 13 killers, murderers, rapists and drug dealers in this country whose full-time pursuits are ALL crime-related.</p>
<p>By Janet Reno&rsquo;s estimate, there are about a million gang members in the country besides MS-13.  All of them engage in murders and crime on a daily basis.  They&rsquo;re not only dangerous they&rsquo;re a threat to national security.</p>
<p>But what does our heroine, Janet Napolitano, and the liberal press concentrate on?  It is, of course, 9 members of a little rag tag group of religious zealots who call themselves a militia.</p>
<p>If anybody ever accuses these people of behaving in a sane and rational way, he should be shot for criminal exaggeration.</p>
<p>When we get our next terrorism attack that costs American lives, you can bet these mentally challenged ideologues will be blaming the tea partiers and Rush Limbaugh for something that&rsquo;s infinitismally insignificant by comparison.</p>

		<p>60 years?  Maybe 60 seconds after conviction. Then either a bullet to the head or a rope and tree limb. Why should we pay for this PO* to live for the next 60 years. Better he should be gone and of no more threat to us.<br>
This is our problem; we are suppose to care for the rights of those who would kill us without hesitation. This government worries more about right leaning religious people than it does about those who willingly and often do harm to society.<br>
Forget their rights; quick trial, sentence, and quick execution of said sentence.</p>

		<p>What an absolutely SLANDEROUS NEWS ARTICLE&hellip; Why we all know these wonderful people risking life and limb on their journey from Latin America only come here to better themselves. To be able to provide a better standard of living for their loved ones. To &#8220;do the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t take.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesus Christ! Will our corrupt Washington politicians ever come to their senses? How many more crimes, killings, rapes need to be committed before our bureaucrats have the guts to seal our borders?</p>

<p>Unmitigated evil rules today in Washington and our politicians are bribed, blackmailed or intimidated into compliance with the dictates of the Globalist (communist) shadow government.  Their actions have nothing whatsoever to do with a lack of common sense or courage.  They are selling us out and will continue to do so as long as the public continues to act deaf, dumb and blind&hellip;</p>
