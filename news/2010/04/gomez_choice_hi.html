<h1>Gomez Choice Highlights Importance of Latinos in Church</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gillian Flaccus, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, California), April 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Archbishop Jose Gomez&rsquo;s appointment Tuesday to head the Archdiocese of Los Angeles underscores the growing importance of Latinos in the American church and promises to give the nation&rsquo;s largest Roman Catholic diocese an even stronger voice in the immigration debate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mexican-born Gomez was named coadjutor for Los Angeles, which means he will take over the archdiocese when current archbishop Cardinal Roger Mahony retires next Feb. 27, his 75th birthday.</p>
<p>Gomez, who now leads the Archdiocese of San Antonio, appeared at the downtown Los Angeles cathedral, taking most questions in Spanish and vowing to make comprehensive immigration reform a priority.</p>
<p>He noted the first four bishops of the Los Angeles territory were Hispanic, and his appointment is a return to the church&rsquo;s roots.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s one of the great Catholic communities in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Los Angeles, like no other city in the world, has the global face of the Catholic church.&#8221;</p>
<p>The appointment of Gomez puts him in line to become the highest-ranking Latino in the American Catholic hierarchy and the first Latino cardinal in the U.S.</p>
<p>The leader of the large and important Los Angeles archdiocese has traditionally been a cardinal and worn a red hat.</p>
<p>Mahony said he was &#8220;grateful to God for this gift of a Hispanic archbishop&#8221; and said he pressed for a Hispanic replacement during a 2008 audience with the pope.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics comprise 70 percent of the 5 million Catholics in the Los Angeles archdiocese, and more than one-third of the 65 million Catholics in the United States.</p>
<p>In a separate nod to Latino Catholics, Benedict in 2007 named Archbishop Daniel N. DiNardo of Galveston-Houston as the first cardinal for heavily Latino Texas.</p>
<p>Gomez was recently elected chair of the Committee on Migrants and Refugee Services for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and will be the voice of the Catholic church on immigration reform, said Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man is not just a Hispanic, but he was born in Mexico, so he&rsquo;s an immigrant,&#8221; Reese said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Archbishop from Mexico says he will make amnesty &ldquo;a priority.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Even their religious figures are so biased to the exclusion of everything but their own race they refuse to think in any terms that regard putting the country first.</p>
<p>Hispanics, like blacks, will not give loyalty to this country unless they are in control.  They do not want to assimilate.  They want to rule and change the entire country into an environment that is identical to their own faled states.</p>
<p>It is this tribal competition and refusal to assimilate into American culture that makes peaceful break up an absolute necessity to avoid civil war.</p>
<p>If peaceful break up doesn&rsquo;t occur, then blacks and Hispanics will be responsible for starting the second civil war by their refusal to integrate.</p>

		<p>I disagree with #2. When America was a great country (before 1950), most Black and Hispanic men wanted to be part of America. Now with Liberalism the dominant ideology, Black and Hispanic men do not want to be part of the mess America has become. </p>

		<p>One Catholic American Message to Catholic Church</p>
<p>The founding fathers of America were deeply mistrustful<br/>
of the sheer organizational power of The Church. For good<br/>
reason. You are now crossing every line separating Church<br/>
and State. You are using the organizational power The Church<br/>
and the power of Scripture to advance a Leftist political agenda.<br/>
Advocating the erasure of national boundaries..and this what illegal immigration is..is making the Church just what the Founding Fathers said it was.. a menace to Freedom. Stop now.</p>

		<p>The Catholic Church hierarchy doesn&rsquo;t get it. Mexicans are NOT Catholic. They do not and can not understand Catholicism. They simply regard it as another social service provider.</p>
<p>In truth, Catholicism was and still is the single most important catalyst of white European civilization: it was absolutely essential to the rise of the West, heavily promoting scholarship, law and order, individual moral accountability, rights of women, marriage, and child bearing among congregation members. It should be taking a lead in the fight against the Islamization of Europe and white population decline and not waste its time proselytizing to third world people, who are the natural constituency of Islam, a religion invented by and for NAMs, since it requires no depth of reflection or moral insight.</p>
<p>NAMs do not have the power to preserve the Catholic church down through the ages any more than a majority minority can preserve the United States. The white Catholic church hierarchy have a lot in common with deluded left wing American political elites who believe a non-white majority is just swell and necessary for insuring continuance instead of virtually guaranteeing deterioration and decline.</p>
<p>Whites should turn on the wolves among us who seek the destruction of our churches, our culture, and our nations.</p>

		<p>What happened to the missionary priests I recall from childhood? At that time, the Church sent priest to foreign lands to minister to the people THERE. Now,it seems that the Church wants to bring everyone from Latin American countries HERE. They have become the chosen people despite the fact that crime is rampant. They begin by breaking and entering and,sadly, finish many times with murder, as in the case of the Arizona rancher, Robert Krentz. Never have I heard any of the pro-illegal supporters mention the lawlessness that seems to surround illegal aliens. They just want to pack as many illegal aliens into this country as possible. The Church is driving away those who keep it going financially. </p>

		<p>I KNEW it!!!    The bishop Gambino Zavala would have been a MUCH better choice than Pendejo Gomez.  Zavala was doubtless too young   &mdash;   you have to have one foot in the grave before the Church will appoint you Archbishop.  But L.A. is way the poorer for it.  I don&rsquo;t know if Zavala would have favored amnesty for illegals or not; he probably would have, since the Church is so solidly on the Social Justice bandwagon.  I find this absolutely disgusting - it is the OPPOSITE of what the nuns used to teach in Catholic schools.  Way back when they taught strict anti-Communism and pro-educating-yourself-to-help-yourself.  And missions&rsquo; objectives included teaching the mission trades and methods of self-help, so they could take care of themselves when the missionaries left.  Today it&rsquo;s just the free-handout method.  Pretty pathetic and - anti-American.</p>

		<p>Ironically, in Latin America, Catholicism is seen as a thing of the Spanish white upper caste. The brown Indian masses are becoming evangelical Protestant or even Mormon at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>Mainstream Catholicism has become totally worthless since Vatican II; just another branch of the universal church of liberalism. Traditional Catholicism is where it&rsquo;s at.</p>

		<p>To Brendan:  &#8220;Traditional Catholicism is where it&rsquo;s at&#8221;.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself.  To get an idea of what real, unvarnished and unapologetin Catholicism is like, take a look at www.fatherwathen.com.</p>
<p>Unlike the so-sorry Vatican II types who are more interested in a Marxist/Liberal social gospel of &#8220;reform&#8221;, Catholicism is authoritarian and quite Euro-centric.  </p>
