	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When the country changed from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe, we were very excited,&#8221; one man, Kizita, told me {snip}. &#8220;But we didn&rsquo;t realize the ones we chased away were better and the ones we put in power would oppress us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been better if whites had continued to rule because the money would have continued to come,&#8221; added a neighbor, {snip}. &#8220;It was better under Rhodesia. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>Over and over, I cringed as I heard Africans wax nostalgic about a nasty, oppressive regime run by a tiny white elite. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People I talked to were terrified for their personal safety if quoted  &mdash;  much more scared than in the past. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} An impressive health and education system is in tatters, and life expectancy has tumbled from about 60 years in 1990 to somewhere between 36 and 44, depending on which statistics you believe.</p>
<p>Western countries have made the mistake of focusing their denunciations on the seizures of white farms by Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s cronies. That&rsquo;s tribalism by whites; by far the greatest suffering has been endured by Zimbabwe&rsquo;s blacks.</p>

		<p>Another article by the self-loathing white Nicholas Kristof, writing for the anti-white, anti-Western, anti-American newspaper, New York Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Western countries have made the mistake of focusing their denunciations on the seizures of white farms by Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s cronies.&#8221;  Not that there have been many such denunciations.  Of course, it was &#8220;a mistake&#8221; to denounce any stupidity, destructive actions or outright racism on the part of blacks.  Only white people are capable of doing anything negative, and only blacks capable of suffering injustice. </p>
<p>Kristof is a moron.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Western countries have made the mistake of focusing their denunciations on the seizures of white farms by Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s cronies&#8221;  But that is the primary cause of the collpase of Zimbabwe.  The white farmers both fed the country and were the economic engine.  They employed blacks on their farms.  They employed blacks in the trucking companies that took the harvest to market.  They employed the blacks who loaded the ships that sent crops overseas.  The crops they exported brought in the foreign currency needed to buy what wasn&rsquo;t produced locally.  The backbone of the economy was destroyed.  It is the blacks who practice tribalism.  They are the ones who kill each other in addition to whites.  If whites were tribal (and I wish we were) they would not have insisted the Rhodesians give their country away.  If whites were tribal western nations would have helped Rhodesia stay white-run.  No my friend, the cause of the calamity is black triablism, racism and general stupidity.</p>

		<p> This tool Komrade Kristoff just doesn&rsquo;t get it. &#8221; I cringed as I heard Africans wax nastalgic about a nasty, oppresive regime run by a tiny white elite&#8221;. The new regime is worse as stated by the citizens, but Kristoff doesn&rsquo;t cringe at that. Any oppresive regime is bad regardless of color. &#8220;seizures of white farms&#8221; is not suffering enough for this dope, but plunging their life expectancy 20 years in 20 years, is the fault of who, &#8220;white tribalism&#8221;? Western countries have made a mistake. They allow the likes of you to become a writer for the NYT.</p>

		<p>The same thing, and even worst is happening now in my country South Africa.</p>
<p>We are on the brink of civil war because the country is run by people with an IQ of average 70. How on earth can people like that make a success of anything?</p>
<p>I am no racist, but Im a realist. If you dont belief me, look at the news online about SA. More than 3000 white farmers already murdered since we gave our country away under pressure from the West. An average murder rate of 25000 people per year in our rainbow nation.</p>
<p>You will see what a disaster the soccer WC will be, and after that the new SA will implode!</p>

		<p><i>Western countries have made the mistake of focusing their denunciations on the seizures of white farms by Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s cronies. That&rsquo;s tribalism by whites; by far the greatest suffering has been endured by Zimbabwe&rsquo;s blacks.</i></p>
<p>A typical liberal rant.  Why are Zimbabwe&rsquo;s blacks suffering so?  Mainly because their economy has been destroyed and the government has resorted to financing its police state by printing money, which has ruined everyone not connected to Mugabe with hyperinflation.  How was the economy ruined?  By taking farms and other productive assets from the whites who created them and knew how to manage them and giving them to Mugabe&rsquo;s cronies, who don&rsquo;t know how to run anything.</p>
<p><i>An impressive health and education system is in tatters&hellip; </i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that impressive health and education system was largely created by whites.  But it&rsquo;s okay if their property is taken and the white people are pushed out of Zimbabwe, after all, it&rsquo;s the black people who matter.<br>

<p>Ha ha not bloody likely. When has a non white ever caved to &#8220;international pressure&#8221; ?  Why on earth would Mugabe ever hand over power and trade his live of gaudy splendour for a dreary prison cell in the Hague?  What a moronic twit, liberals like him murdered Rhodesia and then disavow their own culpability in the easily foreseeable hell that followed.<br>

		<p>I seem to recall Mr. Kristof a few years ago writing a similar column where he visited South Africa and was shocked-SHOCKED!- when most blacks told him life was much better under apartheid.</p>
<p>This guy actually took his (non-white) wife and children to Zimbabwe w/him! Since they made it out alive Kristoff is now actually touting this dump as a safe low-crime tourist attraction! He&rsquo;s telling Times readers that for their next vacation &#8220;Skip the South of France. Try Zimbabwe Instead.&#8221;<br>

<p>Average IQ of 70? Are these the same beliefs that kept whites in SA feeling &#8216;superior&rsquo;, and more importantly, kept them from protecting themselves when they had the chance? Being angry and willfully ignorant is not the same thing as being born with a low IQ, and a lack of capacity to learn&hellip; It just tends to lead to that outcome.</p>

		<p>If there are that many blacks willing to say &#8220;it was better when whites ruled us&#8221; directly to the face of the white man himself, imagine how many more feel that way but WONT say it?</p>
<p>So apparently having food and jobs are more important than trying to pretend they&rsquo;re on equal footing with whitey, now that the latter two disappeared along with the former.  Too bad for them they couldn&rsquo;t make the simple connection that you can&rsquo;t have one without the other.</p>

		<p>I read the entire article yesterday.  Kristoff brags on how he brought his family along to disguise himself as a tourist so he could report unfettered.  Knowing what all of us do about danger in Zimbabwe, even in the MSM, why would a man of integrity use his kids like a human shield of sorts to get some news story?</p>
<p>I have great respect for Kristoff&rsquo;s efforts to stop sex trafficing, but when it comes to racial issues, he seems to be a bit loopy.  </p>
<p>He said in the article that white countries need to be as hard on Mugabe and his goons as they were on the white minority government of Rhodesia.  Trouble is, then they will be accused of racism and imperialism if they do.  Even though white gov&rsquo;ts haven&rsquo;t done much besides boycott, Mugabe has successfully framed it as an imperialist thing.</p>
<p>People like Kristoff (an odd name for a Jewish man) don&rsquo;t realize that in much of the world its either Rhodesia or Mugabe.  One evil or another, just in different degrees.  Social justice is not a wave sweeping over the world.  It&rsquo;s a typhoon swamping only Western countries and drowning them.</p>

		<p>In the full article in NYT, Kristof states that Zimbabwe has &#8220;friendly people&#8221; and &#8220;little crime&#8221;.  In comparisons of crime stats on Nation Master.com, it ranks 16th of 49 nations observed in murders and 13th of 50 in rapes.  And this is just the crime reported, no doubt, in a country where people probably want to remain as anonymous as possible!  <br>

		<p>The world over, and America included, wherever you have a majority of blacks and blacks running things you have universally a collapse of civilization and infrastructure.<br>
The world over.  That&rsquo;s empirical evidence that can&rsquo;t be denied.  That Komrad Kristoff denies such overwhelming evidence makes of him an idiot.  And Mr. Kristoff doesn&rsquo;t have the excuse of having an average IQ of 70-85 as the black race possesses.<br>
That makes him an even bigger idiot - a self-inflicted moron.</p>

		<p>Kristoff, like the vast majority of leftists, sees the world through his &#8220;religious&#8221; lense. that is, he has accepted certain parameters, a belief system, if you will. Within that &#8220;belief system&#8221;, he can be logical, just like within a religion. This &#8220;religion&#8221; prevents him from seeing the world as it is. So when Kristoff visits SA or ZB, he sees a &#8220;liberated&rsquo; people, liberated from the oppressive White minority, and is incapable of seeing the reality. </p>

<p>Two quotes, just inches apart: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Over and over, I cringed as I heard Africans wax nostalgic about a nasty, oppressive regime run by a tiny white elite.&#8221;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&hellip;and&hellip;</p>
<p><i>An impressive health and education system is in tatters, and life expectancy has tumbled from about 60 years in 1990 to somewhere between 36 and 44, depending on which statistics you believe.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
So if Bad Old White Rhodesia   &mdash;   by Kristof&rsquo;s own admission   &mdash;   had an impressive health and education system, and life expectancy was about 50% longer, and <i>even the blacks there admit they preferred it</i>, then what right does Kristof have to call it &#8220;a nasty, oppressive regime run by a tiny white elite.&#8221; </p>
<p>If Ian Smith&rsquo;s Rhodesia was &#8220;nasty&#8221; and &#8220;oppressive,&#8221; please, Mr. Kristof, tell us what words you would use to describe Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s Zimbabwe? </p>
<p>Oh, right: &ldquo;Skip the South of France. Try Zimbabwe Instead.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>I heard the same sad refrain from blacks in Uganda in 1968. Things were so much better under the white man. In 1890 they built a railway to the coast 1000 km away, that ran like clockwork until the white man left. Today it is abandoned. On the subject of Uganda, here is an interesting tidbit. The UN world food program that does such sterling work in feeding the starving in Uganda uses the money donated by the US and other sucker to buy food guess where? In 2008, last available figures, they spent $53 million buying food in Uganda. This must be the age-old African philosophy of the ruling kleptocrats, the wealth of a country is for them, the poverty is for the west.</p>

		<p>Sad but true that most of Africa would be better off if again managed as colonies of European powers, always excepting the former Belgian Congo, where good King Leopold showed how to reduce a population by two million without even trying. Or, the German extermination of the Hereroes. Britain seems to have done better, yet even they failed. Ghana should have been a success. It had trained African elite, regional elections culminating in a national, a peaceful transition, and a talented and charismatic leader in Kwame Nkruma. But, he rapidly dwindled into a despot, and was overthrown while on some overseas tour. </p>

		<p>Not so long ago I was in a room in a house in rural England (errr how did they get here ?) with several black Zimbabweans, inevitably  the subject came around to Mugabe. </p>
<p>I made the point that black Zims had been better off under whites than under a black govt, all disagreed. Then I pointed out that the Zims present were black and had fled to seek asylum in the UK.</p>
<p>All looked at their feet and changed the subject quickly. Now the truth is out</p>
