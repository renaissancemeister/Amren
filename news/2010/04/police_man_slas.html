<h1>Police: Man Slashes Owner&rsquo;s Dog; Animal Loses Eye</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shawn Cohen, Journal News, (White Plains, New York), April 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A prejudiced pooch that reportedly disliked minorities was slashed last night by a black man who had grown tired of the dog&rsquo;s incessant barking at him, police said.</p>
<p>The German Shepherd lost an eye, and the alleged slasher  &mdash;  who worked for an oil delivery business where the dog stood guard  &mdash;  was arrested on a felony aggravated cruelty charge.</p>
<p>Andrew Owens, 58, was arraigned this morning in City Court after spending the night in jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog reacts to black people, Hispanics, anyone who is not white,&#8221;_owner Paul Tocco said. &#8220;She always barked at him. He (Owens) was well aware the dog didn&rsquo;t like him, and he knew to stay away from her.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last night, he &#8220;egged on&#8221; the barking dog and charged at her, Detective Ken Ross III said. He allegedly then pulled out a nine-inch folding knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;He taunted her with his arm, raised his arm with a knife and slashed the dog across the face,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He cut the dog over the right eye, all the way down to the eye socket bone.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rather than going after Owens, Tocco placed Jenna [the dog] in a work van and drove her to a Greenburgh animal hospital. A veterinarian performed emergency surgery, but the eye couldn&rsquo;t be saved, Ross said. Today, the dog was transferred to an animal hospital in Scarsdale.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tocco said he will never allow Owens to work there again. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want him around here anymore,&#8221; he said.<br>

		<p>It just might be a coincidence, but I have noticed that dogs in general, even dogs that blacks own, are more hostile toward black strangers than white or other non-black strangers.</p>

		<p>What an idiot, now dogs are racist too. I feel sorry for the dog. I guess his &#8216;racism&rsquo; was justified after all. I believe most canines naturally hate black people because they can sense the natural aggressiveness and evil harmful intentions present within most black people most of the time.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A prejudiced pooch&#8221; I was lucky enough to  grow up with an Irish Setter on each end of the fireplace in a 99.99% majority neighborhood. One incident I`ll never,ever forget, when I realized Shannon was more able to look after me, than me him, was on a dark night heading to the store for a 10:00pm treat. I was about 14 I guess. On the way were some spooky vacant woods that I didn`t even venture into in daytime without at least one companion.  </p>
<p>  As I walked across the street from there two Black males in the early to mid twenties suddenly emerged from them like some kind of World War II destroyers from behind a smokescreen. What scared me most was the way their heads bobbed together in conspiratorial planning right before they changed direction and headed straight towards me. I gotta admit I was simply frozen with fear. I tried to prompt the family pet into some kind of response but no words would utter from my mouth. My feet were glued to the ground as if by some kind of invisible superglue.</p>
<p> Without coaching good `ol Shannon channeled then let loose with some kind of low rumbling between that of a volcano and a werewolf with rabies. It was  a sound I`d never ever heard from him in  a lifetime we had shared together. The two ner do wells changed course as if they had suddenly come upon the edge of a precipice. </p>
<p>  When we got to the store I gladly forfeited  for once my usual Baby Ruth/Butterfinger combo washed down with a DP and fed that damn wonderful dog  Slim Jims from my palm like they were on some kind of conveyor belt. I stuck my nose and face as far as I could into his fur and softly whispered to him, &#8220;Buddy Boy! I think you just saved my life&hellip;&#8221;</p>

Now we have racial violence between blacks and dogs- ridiculous!</p>
<p>No wonder many Westchester County suburbs stonewalled for years to build affordable housing.  </p>
<p>Kinda unlikely to have interracial, (now interspecies) conflict when communities remain ninety five- plus percent white. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Why do dogs bark at blacks, and not others?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer, from what I have been told, is actually pretty funny when you think about it:&hellip; Dogs, like I believe every animal, are &#8216;color blind&rsquo; which makes darker skinned people appear almost ghostly to them. I had a great laugh the first time I had heard this, but it does actually make sense.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip; could there be other explanations?</p>

		<p>While in the service of my country in various countries I cannot remember any dogs that cared for black servicemembers. In Vietnam the scout dogs seemed to have a real grudge against &#8220;soul brothers&#8221; and I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw a black dog handler in Vietnam.  Stationed near the DMZ, in Korea, with the 1/9th Inf (Manchus) I can recall the fear the brothers had of our German Shepards. In the &#8220;infamous riots off-post at Camp Humphreys, Korea&#8221; it was the working dog that struck fear into their hearts, along with a peed-off Korean workforce that was tired of the racial problems stirred up by the brothers.  Dogs can sense whose friend or foe and needs no training in this aspect.  Now if the liberal AA types could pick up a little of this knowledge the United States might stop it&rsquo;s slide into 3rd world status.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not black. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of dogs go nuts just because I was out taking a walk, and I never ever thought to slash or hurt them. </p>
<p>When I was young and had a paper route, at collection time I would try to get the owners to help me make friends with their dogs. It never occurred to me that the solution to a hostile canine was to injure the poor dog with a knife.</p>
<p>A few treats, some encouragement from the owner, a bit of petting, and pretty soon the dog wags its tail when he sees you. Why on earth would anybody exchange a happy tail-wagger you can stop, talk to, and pet, for the chance to brutalize what could have been a new friend? </p>
<p>Andrew Owens is evil, not to mention cruel, brutal, and stupid. I wouldn&rsquo;t blame anybody, man or dog, for not wanting him around. </p>

		<p> A suitable punishment for the villainous Mr. Owens? Use a knife to slash his face and put out HIS right eye, just as he did to the dog.</p>
<p> And by the way   &mdash;   animals don&rsquo;t react that way to a certain class of people without good reason. My guess is that some black (probably) was cruel to Jenna at some earlier date, unbeknownst to her owner. Thus, she associates a dark-skinned person with harmful acts done to her, and reacts aggressively toward people that look like that, as a result.</p>
<p> Notice how the article referred to her as a &#8220;prejudiced pooch&#8221;? I wonder if they have editors at newspapers any more, to catch such absurd phrases as that and remove them from an over-heated reporter&rsquo;s copy. Evidently not at the Journal-News.</p>

		<p>Dogs react differently to minorities than Whites for the simple reason that to a dog&rsquo;s acute senses, the differences between ethnic groups are as obvious as the difference between a cat and a dog is to us.</p>
<p>They sense the difference, and they bark.  Exactly the same way they know the difference between a family member, and a stranger.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re far more intelligent than most people realize.</p>

<p>I agree. I don&rsquo;t think dogs have any kind of a &#8220;sixth sense&#8221; about who&rsquo;s good and who&rsquo;s bad, despite what dog lovers might tell you. I&rsquo;m white, and when I unknowingly walked  past a police canine unit squad car once, the sudden barking of the dog inside nearly scared the you-know-what out of me.</p>
<p>If a dog develops a disliking for members of a certain race, it is most likely, as one poster mentioned, because of a bad experience the dog has had with a member of that race in the past, or because the dog is picking up on the attitudes of its owner.</p>

		<p>Dogs respond to treatment as well as training, instinct and life experience.  If a black abused a dog or a member of its family it would be wary of blacks.  I have seen dogs adopted from bad homes who are very leery of men because a man abused the dog.  I have also seen dogs who will go to great lengths to protect children and other family members.  They are smart, they learn from experience and yes, they do have emotions.  Don&rsquo;t we all want people who have given us a hard time to stay away?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m betting that those were females.  I&rsquo;ve known a lot of people who have owned multiple dogs of different genders, and they always have the same story   &mdash;   When it&rsquo;s time to head to bed, the females always sleep close to where people sleep, and the males sleep close to a door that leads from the house to the outside.  In other words, the females are thinking about protecting living organisms, and the males are thinking about protecting the integrity of the property.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is dogs having bad experiences with blacks that makes them seem not to like them. Almost all the dogs I&rsquo;ve had have displayed a different attitude towards blacks. My grandchildren have a Chihuahua, and he is friendly to everyone except for black people. Blacks seem to know that dogs don&rsquo;t like them and are afraid of them. I&rsquo;ve seen big black guys truly afraid of a small dog.</p>
<p>Dogs are not sight animals, but rather are known for their keen sense of smell. My guess there is some difference that dogs detect and react to.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll offer a guess as to why dogs seem to overreact to blacks&hellip;</p>
<p>One tip as to how to behave around an unknown dog is to NOT smile.<br>
The dog views this as a baring of teeth - a challenge. Blacks&rsquo; teeth appear much more prominently due to the size of the mouth and the color contrast of the white teeth against a black background.</p>
<p>Like I say, just a guess.<br>
I&rsquo;d rather believe, however, that the dogs are simply cuing in on blacks&rsquo; proven, generally aggressive, demeanor.<br>
After all, dogs are smarter than liberals.</p>

		<p>I think there may be several factors at work.</p>
<p>A lot of dogs are wary of strangers regardless of color. But blacks blame everything on racism.</p>
<p>Dog vision is not limited to black and white. But dogs see a more limited spectrum. I don&rsquo;t think the biology of a dog&rsquo;s vision has anything to do with it. But if a dog is unfamiliar with blacks or has been teased or mistreated by blacks it still won&rsquo;t like blacks.</p>
<p>A dog&rsquo;s keenest sense is their sense of smell. And dogs don&rsquo;t like the way blacks smell.</p>

		<p>I dont think dogs react to colour: It&rsquo;s fear and instinct that gets them  twitchy. years ago I used to walk a little dog over the  fields  where i used to live and it happened upon one of the very few black people around the area at this time (early 80s) and it went crazy at her,though usually it was so placid.  But her incessant screaming and flapping didnt help matters neither. So  I made sure in future if ever i saw that woman coming my way I would take a diversion. I think dogs  are a uniquely European thing as nearly everywhere else in the third world  they&rsquo;re considred pests or rabid dangerous beasts. In some parts of Asia and Africa they eat them. </p>
<p> So another thumbs down for multiculture. </p>

Dogs do see colors. They have cones in their retinas. They just have fewer and see colors less intensely and through a different spectrum than humans. Evolutionarily, for canines, seeing color is insignificant. If you  think about it, it makes sense. Humans are omnivores who eat plants. Seeing color is important to judge ripeness and freshness. The same isn&rsquo;t true for a brown rabbit and a grey rabbit.</p>
<p>As predators, dogs have three keen senses. Smell, hearing, and visual acuity to movement.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why or even if dogs single out blacks but if they do, it&rsquo;s likely from experience with blacks and or a specific pheromone peculiar to blacks.</p>

That could explain why some breeds   &mdash;   the protective guard dog breeds in particular   &mdash;   are hostile toward non-white people. They have been selected for their proclivity to protect their masters who were Caucasian.</p>

		<p>Dogs CAN sense evil intent or character.  Just as HUMANS can.  The difference is that dogs have not been indoctrinated in Public Government Owned Schools to quash that innate protective ability as humans have been.  WE have the innate sense to feel discomfort, alarm, warning, and wariness in the presence of evil or threat.  We ignore it because we don&rsquo;t want to seem prejudiced.  And often, that gets women raped, men mugged, and children assaulted.  Blacks, by and large ARE innately aggressive, hostile, and hold hatred for whites in their hearts.  Dogs can sense that.  We can too.  </p>

		<p>I have known  two dogs that were most assuredly &#8220;racists&#8221;, and interestingly enough, both dogs were themselves blasck. One wass a doberman my late uncle owned. He hated  hispanic people, due to having been tormented by the migrant workers  on my uncle&rsquo;s orchard. The other was a little corgi/cocker spaniel cross that my family owned when the children were small. The  little mutt hated black adults, especially males, and despite his small size would try to  attack them every time he saw one. I have no idea why, because we lived in a small, 99% white town, and owned the dog from a 10 week old pup. We took him with us when we went on vacations where there were more blacks for him to encounter, and although he was a loving dog who would let any child do anything to him, he would not let a black adult within leash range of any of the family. He would strain at the leash, barking, snarling and growling with the hair on his back standing up. That dog did more to teach our children to stay away from blacks than anything we did or said. Dogs are great teachers for children.</p>

		<p>From the article: &#8220;He (Owens) was well aware the dog didn&rsquo;t like him, and he knew to stay away from her.<br>
Last night, he &ldquo;egged on&rdquo; the barking dog and charged at her.<br>
He taunted her.&#8221;<br>

Typical black behavior. White people will either stay away from what they perceive as a vicious dog, or make friends with it. Blacks encourage it to attack them, reap the expected consequenses, inflict great damage, then sue somebody. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; instead of simply quitting and finding a new job - perhaps with a decent reference letter from his boss explaining why he quit (it was the company owner&rsquo;s guard dog), Owens decides he would much rather go out of his way to maim the dog, pick up a felony charge and be fired for cause.  When he finally gets out of prison, what sort of things will his ex-boss say when prospective new employers telephone about Owens?</p>

		<p>As A kid we had a great German shepherd, she was (very) intelligent and a great friend to me and my two buddy&rsquo;s, coming with us through the woods and wrestling with us, playing tag and helping us find our way home sometimes. She was very instinctive to hunt after animals.. rabbits or deer or cats for that matter. But she loved people and was never aggressive towards them unless for obvious protection,&hellip; but one time a black man came to the door for something benign&hellip;and she went ballistic. She was never taunted by blacks, nor even had experienced them. Pure instinct of some kind. This black man that slashed the dogs eye seems to have seen himself on the same level as the dog in some primordial way and contested him, brute against brute. Except for the (terrible) fact that this beautiful dog lost its eye&hellip; this story is comical. We always hear&hellip;.. (Its only a color) But Nature.. is not superficial&hellip;The outside of a creature tells a story that goes deeper than appearance. White people I think.. instinctual have aversion to blacks but our intellect tries to treat this objectively&hellip; in so much as (all people are people) etc. and thus we in effort to be just, try to condemn this instinct.. as an irrational fear&hellip;to be gotten over&hellip; But the truth may be that pure objectivism sterilizes certain subjective morsels of wisdom lodged in our DNA that we are better off respecting* Time will tell, those wise enough to listen.</p>

<p>While there may be some truth to this, the latest evidence showing that dogs were domesticated in Europe in the area of what is now Belgium (or possibly Russia), I believe dogs are reacting to something menacing they sense about blacks on a deep, instinctive level.</p>
<p>I have a small shih-tzu whose DNA originated in Nepal, Tibet and later China,   &mdash;  remains of similar dogs have been found in Asia dating back to 8,000 BC.  This &#8216;little lion&rsquo; was not brought to the West until the 30s.</p>
<p>With that said, he is 100% racist against blacks and hispanics, and loves Whites and Asians.  He becomes a tiny terror filled with absolute rage if a black or hispanic walk on the sidewalk in front of our house.  He senses something menacing when they&rsquo;re near, puffs himself up into 6 lbs. of murderous hate and goes into a lunging, yapping attack mode.  Afterwards, it takes a long time for him to calm down and for his fur to lie flat again. </p>
<p>But when my White neighbor rolled down the sidewalk in his wheelchair, the little terror jumped up into the chair and began licking the neighbor&rsquo;s face.  Fortunately, this neighbor loves dogs.</p>
<p>The 85 lb. pit bull/police dog, is unquestionably 100% racist to the core.  When he sees blacks, he seems to detect an imminent attack.  Once I thought he was going to break an inch-thick, steel re-enforced cable when some black kids passed by on the street.  All of his teeth were bared, the whites of his eyes were showing, his fur was on end and he barked and growled furiously until they were well out of sight  &mdash;  a reaction I have never seen with Whites who walk by all day.  I haven&rsquo;t seen the black kids since.</p>
<p>Fortunately, dogs don&rsquo;t know anything about being PC or pretending to be non-racist; they only know blacks pose some kind of threat to their territory, themselves or their human family.</p>
<p>And black crime rates show that the dogs are correct to not want blacks anywhere near them.</p>
<p>We Whites need to take a lesson from our racist dogs and trust our natural instincts around blacks  &mdash;  and tune out the PC conventional wisdom that says &#8216;We are all the same!&rsquo; </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s nothing mysterious about this.  Dogs of any breed often react in a hostile manner to anybody of a different race.  Once they&rsquo;ve been around the newcomer, be he black, Asian, or white and see that their master is comfortable with the person of another race they become their normal selves.</p>
<p>Americans and Europeans, however, are far more likely to have pet animals, so displays of canine suspicion and hostility are most often directed against blacks and Asians.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed this phenomenon on three continents. Dogs are definitely racially aware but not necessarily hostile to other races.</p>

<p>Try a Rhodesian Ridgeback.  (There is another, more colloquial, less PC name for that breed.)  They were bred to bark as little as possible, preferably not at all.  Therefore, they would take the trespassers, presumably black (remember, this is southern Africa we&rsquo;re talking about here) by surprise.  This meant that a potential black neer-do-well couldn&rsquo;t go by which houses he heard barks emanating from and which ones had no barks.</p>

<p>As you know, dogs don&rsquo;t understand size.  A little dog isn&rsquo;t aware that it&rsquo;s little, and a big dog isn&rsquo;t aware that it&rsquo;s big.  It&rsquo;s all about psychology.  Mark Twain said it best   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s not the size of the dog in the fight, it&rsquo;s the size of the fight in the dog.  Honestly, I have found that the smallest dogs are the meanest.</p>

		<p>Dogs show loyalty to the race of their master. That&rsquo;s probably what confuses American dog owners, loyalty. It&rsquo;s a matter of self-esteem. Even dogs want to be thought of as a good person - or a good dog - as it were. They might prefer not to have to go through the pretense, but they are man&rsquo;s best friend.  </p>

		<p>I live in &#8216;the hood&rsquo; and have always had 2 or 3 dogs at any one time to discourage the local thug wannabees.  My dogs have always been mistreated by the local blacks, they have been provoked with sticks, spat upon, caught one trying to hit my dog with a brick, yelled at, you name it.  Whenever I see it happening I laugh because it just makes my dogs meaner and hate blacks even more.  There are whites in the neighborhood too and they get barked at too, but just not as viciously as the blacks.  Not sure what is wrong with this race, but its certainly loused up when dogs don&rsquo;t even like you.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;I&rsquo;d rather believe, however, that the dogs are simply cuing in on blacks&rsquo; proven, generally aggressive, demeanor.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very likely correct.</p>
<p>Although we have no way of knowing in this case, it IS known that dogs are much more sensitive to body language, especially that associated with movement, than humans.</p>
<p>Anybody who suddenly snaps and cuts out a barking dog&rsquo;s eye has probably been on the angry edge for a while.  The dog picks up visually on the aggression in the way the guy moves, finds it threatening, and tries to scare him away by barking.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t understand why our 8 yr. old lab barked every single day at the mailman.  She barked at other strangers too, but usually just the first time they came by. Our vet explained that the first time she barked at the mailman, the mailman put mail in the box, and then, miraculously, WENT AWAY. It worked! Then he had the audacity to come back the next day.  So she barked again and inexpicably, HE LEFT.  She was two for two, on a winning streak.  This has been going on for 8 yrs.  The difference with the mailman and friends is, you let the friends in, or at least open the door or talk to them through the window.</p>
<p>Perhaps Jenna the German shepherd had had prior success barking away would-be bad guys, such as delivery men or temp workers.  I have a hard time believing it was this guy&rsquo;s race, more perhaps his temperament and movements.  BTW, we&rsquo;ve had 3 different mailmen in all these years, and they were all Asian. Our dog isn&rsquo;t racist, she&rsquo;s just doing her job.</p>

<p>It was a German Shepherd. Not only a racist dog, but probably a Nazi dog to boot. (sarcasm = &#8220;off&#8221;)</p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t start the flames&hellip;I own three GSD&rsquo;s. And interestingly enough, one of my black co-workers has no problems petting them, and they have no problems with him. He was also formerly a nationally-ranked team roping competitor, so maybe it&rsquo;s just that he knows how to get along with animals.</p>

<p>Dogs are not color blind, they see fewer colors as black/white provides better night vision. A black person would look far more &#8220;ghostly&#8221; to us than they would to a dog because his vision in low light is much sharper.</p>
<p>I think there are several reasons, natural instinct regarding danger being one, black behavior towards dogs being another. Also dogs do sense fear, they react to it not because it is a weakness but because it signals an unstable situation that could become dangerous (if a stranger knocked at your front door and stood their acting nervous and fidgety you would be concerned too, it signals possible conflict).</p>
<p>Watch how blacks treat dogs, even at the vet or in pet supply stores they rarely speak kindly to their own animals or speak to them at all. I recall a black firefighter seeing a rescue pit mix in a pen at a pet fair, he walked up and knocked with his fist on the top of the carrier to see &#8220;how vicious the dog was&#8221;. A white person never would have done that, if they see a dog that interests them they would have put their hand near the cage, talk to the dog, related to the animal as a sentient being.<br>

Her dog is going with a winning strategy, so why not stick with it?    Hey, if you&rsquo;ve barked at the guy for 8 years, and he ALWAYS goes away, there must be something to it. There&rsquo;s no arguing with success.</p>

		<p>Sonya, I would laugh until my sides hurt if a black man hits a dog that way, then the dog takes a bite out of him, literally. I would never treat any dog that way, period. Funny thing is many dogs I never seen before come right up to me tail wagging wanting attention, even huge and powerful dogs such as German Shepards, Great Danes and Labs.  Many whites here in my area do train their dogs to attack blacks on sight, because until recently, almost all the rapes, murders and robberies were committed by blacks, now it&rsquo;s more and more Hispanic invaders. I&rsquo;ve seen how badly blacks often treat their dogs, and that sickens me.</p>
