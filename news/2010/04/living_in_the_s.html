<p>DREAMING BIG</p>
<p>Around the country, student advocacy for immigration reform has recently adopted this practice of &#8220;coming out,&#8221; of putting a face on the cause. In Chicago, eight undocumented students spoke at a rally that drew a crowd of 1,000 people on the same day as Harvard&rsquo;s event, and cities from Los Angeles to Orlando followed with rallies of their own. In Florida, four undocumented and formerly undocumented students began a 1,500-mile walk on New Year&rsquo;s Day. They planned to go from Miami to Washington, D.C. to raise awareness about the DREAM Act and their situation. Their &#8220;Trail of Dreams&#8221; campaign has attracted supporters as well as opponents, including an encounter with the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia.</p>
<p>Of course, most undocumented students keep their status quiet for fear of deportation or the stigma attached to being illegal. But as the wait for immigration reform continues and the obstacles to a normal life become more apparent, more are pushing their fears aside and speaking out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 1982 Supreme Court decision requires that students have access to a primary and secondary education regardless of their immigration status, but there are no similar measures regarding higher education. Edward Schumacher-Matos, who directs the Harvard Inter-Faculty Initiative on Immigration and Integration Policy and Studies, believes the primary reason to pass the DREAM Act is that it is in the country&rsquo;s best interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have invested so much in training and educating this group of young people,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If they&rsquo;re good enough and have responded enough to be able to get to go to college, then we as a country need these people and should want these people.&#8221;</p>
<p>While many undocumented students may have day-to-day experiences similar to those of their documented peers, the fundamentally restricted structure of their opportunities becomes clear when it comes to certain milestones: 16th birthdays do not mean driver&rsquo;s licenses, and high school graduations do not open the doors to college or a job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because they are guaranteed a K-12 education, the first major limitation that most undocumented students face comes when they look ahead to college. Although there is no federal law barring universities and colleges from accepting undocumented applicants, these students are ineligible for federal financial aid, and most private aid and scholarships are restricted to legal residents.</p>
<p>Eleven states currently offer in-state tuition for undocumented students, who often still struggle to pay these lower rates. {snip}</p>
<p>A select few are able to defer the limitations of an undocumented future when they are accepted at schools like Harvard. In its efforts to recruit the best students from the nation and the world, Harvard is one of very few universities with the financial resources to offer merit-based, need-blind admissions standards for all students, including those ineligible for federal financial aid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>POLICY AND POLITICS</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Much of the current intensity over unauthorized immigration goes back to the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which made it illegal for employers to hire or recruit undocumented immigrants, while also granting amnesty to immigrants who had come to the U.S. before 1982 and resided here continuously since that point. The law was largely ineffective at decreasing unauthorized immigration, the undocumented population continued to rise, and the resulting widespread backlash against immigration persists to this day.</p>
<p>The DREAM Act has become tangled in this politicized debate, despite a solid base of bipartisan support. &#8220;The real political issue is that both sides are using the DREAM Act to hold the other side hostage,&#8221; Schumacher-Matos says. Proponents of more progressive immigration policies want to leverage the bill&rsquo;s bipartisan support to pull through comprehensive reform, while their opponents will support the DREAM Act only in exchange for stricter enforcement. There are also those who reject amnesty in any form.</p>
<p>Due to the tensions surrounding immigration policy, students advocating for the DREAM Act have found themselves performing a balancing act.</p>
<p>In March of 2008, Scott M. Elfenbein &rsquo;11 led a group of students to found Harvard College Act on a Dream, which strives to raise awareness and push immigration reform forward. But since then, the club has had to reassess and redirect its initiatives multiple times.</p>
<p>Tran [Melissa Tran, &rsquo;10, current president of Harvard College Act On A Dream] recalls that one of the club&rsquo;s first initiatives was to prompt Harvard to advertise itself as a &#8220;sanctuary university&#8221;, modeled after sanctuary cities. There are more than 30 of these cities around the country, which openly publicize practices that refrain from inquiring about immigration status. Act On A Dream reached out to Harvard University Police Department and the admissions office, but faced some resistance. They backed off amidst worries that pushing too hard on HUPD would draw negative attention to undocumented students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group faced a similar situation last spring, when it began lobbying for President Drew G. Faust to show her support for the DREAM Act. {snip}</p>
<p>But Faust ended up publicly endorsing the DREAM Act in a letter to federal lawmakers last spring, a step that was in line with support from the Association of American Universities and The College Board, and has since been replicated with support from presidents at other schools, including the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SAFETY AT HARVARD</p>
<p>Higher education at places like Harvard offers a temporary respite from the undocumented life in the outside world. {snip}</p>
<p>But even though Mariana [an undocumented student who graduated last year] says she cannot imagine Harvard having done any more for her, it could not provide a shield from all the difficulties of life as an undocumented student. Mariana knew that she would never be able to study abroad or get a term-time job, and while her peers were stressed about finding summer internships, most of them were not even options for her. {snip}</p>
<p>Eventually, Mariana convinced herself that she could only take advantage of the opportunities she had now, even if the future remained uncertain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that most [undocumented] students are fine throughout their undergraduate years. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to do as much as you can and you have learned to be satisfied with the things you can do,&#8221; Mariana says, {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UNCERTAIN FUTURES</p>
<p>For those students who know that a Harvard degree will not allow them the same opportunities as their peers, other sources of motivation are necessary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For many Harvard students, once graduation looms, their concerns about speaking out also begin to give way. &#8220;The students who are more willing to be vocal are the ones that have graduated and are really experiencing what it means to be undocumented in the real world, not Harvard&rsquo;s safe place,&#8221; Mariana says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In looking toward the future, there are only two real pieces of advice that people can give Mariana: get married or move back to Mexico. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know the place at all,&#8221; she says. Mariana also cannot leave her family behind, knowing that her mother is still sick. And as far as marriage: &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been proposed to more times than I care to get married,&#8221; she says, remembering the offers of friends she has told about her situation.</p>
<p>Mariana says she would rather be a sacrificial lamb than take the easy way out through a marriage of convenience. {snip}</p>

<p>This is precisely why Harvard should not possess 501(c)(3) status.  Harvard is a networking organization that exists for the benefit of it&rsquo;s membership and to promote an agenda incongruent with the best interests of America. And they obviously have plenty of resources at their disposal  &mdash;  no need for tax breaks to encourage members to donate.  </p>

<p>Dear Comrade Pezza,</p>
<p>I am simply appalled by this above paragraph!</p>
<p>These legitimate, but unfortunately undocumented students of color, should never be referred to, in any circumstance, as being &ldquo;illegal.&rdquo; No human being (unless white) can be &ldquo;illegal;&rdquo; these are the hard facts, proven through both: anthropological diversity sciences; and sociopolitical grievance symposiums, struggling against diabolical white imperialistic privilege paradigms, that bring havoc across this planet. </p>
<p>Undocumented migrants, alternative enrichment individuals, and Eurocentrically negated contributors to history, must all be allowed to Come Out.</p>
<p>Coming Out is good, be it: sexually, racially, spasmodically, or even nebulously!</p>
<p>A kaleidoscopic mosaic of emotional and cognitive fancy, are the progressive political goals here. It is not that one should work harder to obtain their needs for fulfillment, only that their needs expand in response to capitalistic productivity limits and childish political expectations.</p>
<p>In short, get on the dole and find a drug that hypnotically makes Marxism a &ldquo;plausible reality,&rdquo; in either daily life or a coma of rapture.</p>
<p>Non-Workers and Rainbow Deviants of the World, Unite!</p>

<p>Well, even that kind of rainbow, Comrade Pezza, has oddly Red monochromatic indicators; get with the program, or get &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; yourself.</p>
<p>Comrade and General Secretary BHO, CPUSA!</p>

		<p>If I may be direct, I only wish the worst on those at Harvard and other institutions of &#8220;higher learning&#8221; that advocate this stuff.  Why the strong feelings?  My sister was a brilliant student (straight A all the way) back in the late seventies.  When she applied for a scholarship, she was rejected on the basis of our parents making too much money.  I thought that amazing, having a house mortgage to pay, dad was a mechanic, mom worked in meat packing.</p>
<p>I now realize that this happened all the time to working parents with smart kids. Apparently living in the ghetto, with welfare parents, or being a member of a &#8220;protected group&#8221; was the main consideration for taxpayer paid goodies, even back then. Of course, today the education bureaucrats have done one better, now illegal aliens must be considered for Ivy League educations. I can only say, back to my first sentence.</p>

		<p>I suppose it never occurred to these so-called elite intellectuals to actually apply for and pursue citizenship. There are far too many benefits to being &#8216;undocumented&rsquo;, i.e. illegal.</p>

		<p>Funny, I was in Boston just last week and took a walk up Harvard Street from Coolidge Corner. The closer you get to the campus, the more Asians and the fewer blacks and hispanics you see. Just coincidence, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>If Mariana wanted to study abroad so badly, she could have gone back to Mexico.</p>
<p>Harvard does have a few set asides for certain groups that have provided big money to the university. I suppose it tries to avoid picking dummies, but some of the Islamic Studies graduates have failed to impress me, and the business school makes sure a certain number of employees from certain multinational companies get into the MBA program each year.</p>

		<p>Nothing like rewarding criminal behavior. By granting illegals undeserved (and by most Americans, UNWANTED citizenship)!</p>
<p>With our unemployment count at an all-time high, why would our government shoot American workers in the figurative foot, by allowing these damned illegals in to compete with our own. Get serious! Their adult anchor babies, being handed undeserved American citizenship&hellip; will be COMPETING WITH YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, AND ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS&hellip; for ever scarcer jobs in a steadily shrinking American job market!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;A 1982 Supreme Court decision requires that students have access to a primary and secondary education regardless of their immigration status,&rdquo; well, in regard to the issue, here is the first problem of betrayal to the European American/European.  What would be the motivation to educate other countries&rsquo; children who are in our country (the United States of America)?  So, we pay taxes to support some idiotic court ruling.  At our expense, we educate some future anti-White Marxist; an individual that is educated within an anti-White environment.  Reality shows that these university systems are in lock-step with other institutions which are gleefully jubilant in the future demise of the European American/European: minority status within our own country and then, ultimately, eradication.  All may be compared and equated to us paying for the material to build our own gallows. <br>
        <br>
We, as European Americans/Europeans, need to take note of the many institutions which are against us.  Universities certainly do fit into this negative category (just ask Bill Ayers, Cornel West, Skip Gates, etc.).  When is the last time one has heard of a university doing anything positive for a student of European American/European heritage?          <br>

		<p>Illegals coming out and not being arrested is a bad sign. The media will be in full force to give a sympathetic portrayal of illegals just as they did with gays. Gays are now out and getting special rights as a result of massive media promotion. I suspect the same will happen with illegals.</p>
<p>Who wants more latino immigrants in this country:<br>
  Catholic Church - to increase its numbers in the US<br>
  Corporate America - push down wages; larger population means increased demand for basic goods<br>
   Liberals - the more immigrants, the more votes plus the idea of a borderless world is appealing to them.<br>
   Libertarians - idea is that govt. should not use force to stop the movement of people</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s left to oppose immigration &#8220;reform&#8221; ?? I suspect the Republicans will cave in because of the so-called &#8220;latino vote&#8221; and pressure from corporate America.</p>

		<p>Amnesty for illegals will be the catalyst that will spark our second civil war.  </p>
<p>Americans do not want the parasitic dregs of Mexico and Latin America to be given US citizenship as a reward for breaking our laws.  </p>
<p>Americans want these incompatible foreign leeches out of our country once and for all and if it requires making them self-deport in fear for their lives, then so be it&hellip;</p>
