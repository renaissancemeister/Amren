			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Josh Norris, Trentonian, April 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons wants to launch a corps of citizen peacekeepers in Trenton in response to last month&rsquo;s gang rape of a 7-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The co-founder of Def Jam Records, in conjunction with Trenton Mayor Doug Palmer, {snip} told The Trentonian last night that he will put up half the funds for an arm of ENOTA  &mdash;  Educating Neighborhoods to Obey Those in Authority  &mdash;  to be established in Trenton.</p>
<p>Simmons estimated that his share of the costs, although not finalized, could reach as high as $50,000. The other half of the cash will come from Palmer&rsquo;s charitable organization, the Trenton First Initiative.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to get men from the community and train them so they can move through the streets, so they can exude a positive attitude and presence,&#8221; Simmons said. &#8220;Their job is not to patrol in the same way that police patrol.&#8221;</p>
<p>These peacekeepers will wear orange jackets and carry cards declaring their membership in the program.</p>
<p>Simmons said that the peacekeepers&rsquo; presence spreads a sense through the community that things are changing for the better.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Palmer said representatives for the peacekeeping program, which has found success in New York and Delaware, will be on hand at Saturday&rsquo;s rally in support of the victim, to be held at 7 p.m. at the Lighthouse Outreach Ministry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the peacekeepers and those individuals to talk about  &mdash;  which they will Saturday  &mdash;  what they do, not only working within the community, but developing local peacekeepers here that can talk to young people,&#8221; Palmer said, &#8220;not talking down to them, but talking with them and dialoguing and trying to be a positive force in the community.&#8221;</p>

<p>Russell Simmons has made a fortune from rap and hip hop records whose artists and lyrics promote anything but obeying those in authority.  </p>
<p>Seriously, if the real, armed Trenton cops can&rsquo;t keep the peace (not because of incompetence, presumably, but because of civil rights handcuffs), when what makes Mr. Simmons thinks that his orange-clad business-card carrying unarmed mercenaries will do any better?  Sounds to me like more future crime victims.</p>

		<p> I think this is a guy who is putting his money where his mouth is. I believe this is a step in the right direction. Of course, his record company helped to contribute to a lot of problems, but he wants to see changes starting with his own money.</p>

		<p>So, we have what may be the fledgling beginnings of a private police force, financed and paid for by a black rapper mogul. It will not be long before these people are armed and in competition with the police. Obamaster may see the beginning of his SS type of black private army.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t they try something like this in Philadelphia? Were&rsquo;nt they supposed to have 10,000 black men patrolling the city? What happened?</p>

<p>I was wondering when the militia movement would take hold in the black community. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious to me what&rsquo;s going on here  &mdash;  this is surely the beginning of Barrack Jermyn&rsquo;s &#8220;citizen peacekeeping force&#8221; that he told us about on the campaign trail.  Make no mistakes  &mdash;  Rahm Emmanuel is probably pulling the strings here.  Once Simmon&rsquo;s program is considered a &#8220;success&#8221; it will become flush with government &#8220;stimulus&#8221; money and the fascist Obama regime will take over.  They&rsquo;ll be training blacks such as these to fan out across the country to force obedience to &#8220;authority.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>If the men from the &#8220;community&#8221; had one iota of concern to begin with they&rsquo;d be doing it already without having to be paid. This will just attract a bunch of unemployed deadbeats who&rsquo;ll just walk around with their orange jackets and socialize. Until the money runs out, that is.  </p>

		<p>This has been tried in England although it was not in a predominantly &#8216;black&rsquo; area as we have sufficient &#8216;white&rsquo; criminals wandering around at night on &#8216;opportunity thieving&rsquo; patrol! An informative report was compiled by the police, perhaps it could be the basis for a comparison study?<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not going to knock Russell Simmons for trying to do something positive, but do you think that these problems can be solved with words? How naive.  They gang raped a 7 year old and no one did anything to stop it.  Any human should realize this is deplorable.   Does Simmons and the Mayor think they a &#8220;good talkin&rsquo; to&#8221; would have prevented this atrocity?  </p>

<p>Strange how little reaction the Dear Leader got on the campaign trail from his repeated references to needing &#8220;an internal security force, just as well funded as the military.&#8221; One would have thought that local police, state police, and the FBI already constituted &#8220;an internal police force,&#8221; the biggest in the world at present, far bigger than China&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>One could only have assumed that he was referring to a home-grown KGB, needed enforce the rules of the Brave New World he was planning for us. One can but imagine the reaction had the cartoonish John McCain main such a reference, not once, but repeatedly.</p>
<p>Thanks for raising the issue again.</p>

<p>Black programs FOR blacks NEVER run out of funding and never will as long as there are any White taxpaying slaves to provide funding and treacherous Whites to give it to them.</p>
