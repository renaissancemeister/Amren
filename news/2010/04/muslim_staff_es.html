<h1><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7576357/Muslim-staff-escape-NHS-hygiene-rule.html">Muslim Staff Escape NHS Hygiene Rule</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, April 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Muslim doctors and nurses are to be allowed to opt out of strict hygiene rules introduced by the NHS to restrict the spread of hospital superbugs.</p>
<p>Female staff who follow the Islamic faith will be allowed to cover their arms to preserve their modesty despite earlier guidance that all staff should be &#8220;bare below the elbow&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Department of Health has also relaxed rules prohibiting jewellery so that Sikh members of staff can wear bangles linked with their faith, providing they are pushed up the arm while the medic treats a patient.</p>
<p>The Mail on Sunday reported the change had been made after female Muslims objected to being required to expose their arm below the elbow under guidance introduced by Alan Johnson when he was health secretary in 2007.</p>
<p>The rules were drawn up to reduce the number of patients who were falling ill, and even dying, from superbugs such as MRSA and Clostridium difficile.</p>
<p>Revised guidance which relaxed the requirements for some religions was published last month.</p>
<p>Some Muslim staff and those from other groups may be allowed to use disposable plastic over-sleeves which cover their clothes below the elbow and allow the skin to remain covered up.</p>
<p>Derek Butler, chairman of MRSA Action UK, said: &#8220;My worry is that allowing some medics to use disposable sleeves you compromise patient safety because unless you change the sleeves between each patient, you spread bacteria.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scrubbing bare arms is far more effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Department of Health spokesman said: &#8220;The guidance is intended to provide direction to services in how they can balance infection control measures with cultural beliefs without compromising patient safety.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>They are so sensitive to Muslim culture and beliefs - but when it comes to British culture and beliefs, no tolerance is shown and policies are geared toward the aim of extinguishing all remnants of indigenous race and culture.  Who is so blind he cannot see this double standard?</p>

		<p>Could anyone tell me WHY it&rsquo;s &#8220;important to balance infection control measures with cultural beliefs?&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t see that this is important at all.  It seems to me that rules are rules, infection is infection, and germs are germs   &mdash;   and everyone who works in a setting where infection is not just possible but probable should have to undergo the same infection-protecting procedures.  Screw the &#8220;no bare arms&#8221; - if they don&rsquo;t like it, they should work in a different field where they can wear tents to work if they choose.  If I got a staph or Mrsa infection in a hospital where they compromised standards to suit Muslims, there would be SUCH a lawsuit from me!!!</p>

		<p>Sorry AmReners, I have to side with the marxists on this one.  Muslim women should be allowed to cover their arms.  They do this not, as they claim, for reasons of modesty, but because they&rsquo;re really hairy.  It is much more hygienic to have their hair under wraps.  Maybe some elbow length latex gloves, specially marked with a red crescent would do the trick.</p>

François - as you probably know, nurses and other civil service employees - and BBC, BA, etc. have been prohibited from wearing crosses - habjib- ok - sikh knives/turbans- ok but not crosses.</p>
<p>Leftists support anything that helps dismantle civilization.. and are hostile to anything that supports it&hellip;. once you understand that, you understand their seemingly inconsistent stances on things like religion. </p>

		<p>Britain is the poster child for &#8216;How to become irrelevent.&rsquo; It is a nation that has long since lost its soul and its raison d&rsquo;etre for existing as a distinct culture. What we have been witnessing these last few decades is the attempts by Britain&rsquo;s leadership to re invent Britain. A Frankenstein drama that will produce similar results in the not too distant future&hellip;</p>

<p>Where are you writing from, Anonymous? I live in Québec City, Canada. And up here, things haven&rsquo;t yet becom as bad as in Britain, where they are almost being litterally invaded by hordes of Third World immigrants, to whom the local governement gives just about everything they want.</p>
<p>Here, the garment know as burqa has been banned, for Muslim women working for the state.</p>
<p>And in our hospitals, over here, medical personnel are reuired to wear appropriate dress, such as labcoats, protective gowns, scrub suits, etc, and to use special soaps and hand sanitizing lotions. </p>
<p>Hey, the germs that cause potentially fatal hospital-acuired infections, do not care about the word of the Prophet! So everybody has to follow the same dress code and the same laboratory protocols and hygiene rules.</p>
<p>The British, by allowing the word of Allah to supercede medical science, in their NHS-run hospitals, are ridiculing themselves, I think.</p>
<p>How could a European nation once so great, allow itself to sink to the level of a Third World country?</p>
<p>Of course, leftists, and their beliefs and attitudes, are a major part of the problem. But are all leftists really so totally stupied, that they can&rsquo; t understand that, as I already said, potentially fatal germs, do not care about Allah, or Muslim morality?</p>

<p>absolutely.  My brother had a hip replacement done in the famous Mayo clinic in Rochester Minnesota.  He came home with hepatitis C, transmitted to him by a female Indian Dr.</p>
<p>My roommate stayed 3 weeks in UCLA hospital which bills itself the &#8220;best in the west&#8221; and third best in the nation.  She came home with MRSA.  She was on an antibiotic IV drip for a month.<br/>
Twice a day a nurse came by to insert a new drip bag into the IV site.  Everyone was an immigrant from some disgusting filthy third world country.</p>
<p>I visited her while in the hospital.  Most of her drs, all of her technicians and nurse&rsquo;s aides were third world immigrants from filthy disease ridden countries.</p>
<p>To think that it was an English Dr., Joseph Lister who developed the sterile procedures that saved millions from dying from hospital, surgical and childbirth infections!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re close, Jack.  But I&rsquo;d say, better still, that religious fanatics are not compatible with an advanced society.  They come in all kinds.  (For instance, what about people who prefer to let their children die rather than give them vaccinations or medical treatment?)</p>
<p>Not that I mean this as a defense of Moslims and their unique superstitions.  I wonder if the British authorities would be just as &#8220;culturally sensitive&#8221; to those other groups as they are to Moslim sensitivities?   </p>
