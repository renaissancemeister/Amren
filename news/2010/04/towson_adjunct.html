<h1>Towson Adjunct Professor Fired for Racial Remark In Class</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Childs Walker, Baltimore Sun, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Towson University adjunct professor was fired last week after using a racially insensitive term in his art class.</p>
<p>Allen Zaruba, a local artist who had taught at Towson for 12 years, said he was discussing provocative works depicted in textbook chapters on the body and identity when he used the term.</p>
<p>&#8220;I crossed the line,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I made a terrible, terrible mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zaruba, who is white, said his black stepfather used racial terms freely and that &#8220;I never quite got the horror of the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I will never use that term again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is absolutely transgressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Thursday, three days after uttering the remark, Zaruba learned he had been fired in a phone call from interim department Chairman Stuart Stein. He said Stein told him the racial slur was &#8220;never, never, never to be used anywhere on campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though a report in the campus newspaper The Towerlight said Zaruba was examining legal options to fight his dismissal, he said Tuesday, &#8220;I am sorry, and I am not going to contest the provost&rsquo;s decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Deverick Murray, president of the Black Student Union, said most of his members had probably not heard about it and that the organization had not arrived at an official response.</p>
<p>Adam Jackson, president of Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, a campus group that promotes social justice, said he didn&rsquo;t know the context of the incident but was intrigued by Zaruba&rsquo;s wording, which included reference to &#8220;a corporate plantation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the university firing him on the basis of using a racially charged word is an excuse to escape criticism from across the university,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;At worst, it could be a racially insensitive analogy, but to call the university a &#8216;corporate plantation&rsquo; would be a deep statement that directly challenges the politics of this university.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zaruba, 58, taught three classes this semester and said he was devastated that his mistake might cost him future teaching opportunities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite taking responsibility for his error, Zaruba said his firing raises troubling questions about the power of political correctness in modern society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we in for another state of McCarthyism?&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to have compassion and realize that people are not perfect.&#8221;<br>

I&rsquo;m confused, they seem to dance around what he said.  Am I right to think he got fired for saying &#8220;corporate plantation&#8221;?</p>

		<p>So they fired him for a word someone decided is racial. But saying he was white is also racial. Isn&rsquo;t that racism too?</p>

		<p>I have never been a &#8220;hater&#8221; before. I have never thought of myself as a separatist before. Recently, I have a clarity that most of you have had for years. Here it is, and can apply to any race anywhere on earth, &#8220;THEY HATE US&#8221;. Except somehow, they recuited millions of us to fight for them against their own people. They are smarter in the fact that &#8220;they&#8221; would never foresake their own race like we would. There clearly is not enough being done to save us. What happened here is a reason why I have decided to change my nieve ways. </p>

		<p>This is from the full article.<br>
First:<br>
&#8220;I have given my life to this,&#8221; he said, noting that he spent the 2003-2004 school year in South Korea on a Fulbright teaching fellowship.</p>
<p>Next:<br>
He said he also works as a prison minister for Rock City Church of Parkville.</p>
<p>And then these 2 doozies:<br>
Despite taking responsibility for his error, Zaruba said his firing raises troubling questions about the power of political correctness in modern society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we in for another state of McCarthyism?&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to have compassion and realize that people are not perfect.&#8221; </p>
<p> - Okay, Mr. Zaruba, are you awake yet? I sincerely doubt it. Hoisted with his own petard. Or as they say down here in the South, what goes around comes around. </p>

		<p> Lord have mercy! You mean to tell me that an experienced, &#8220;passionate&#8221; teacher, was fired for saying &#8220;plantation&#8221;?!!! The way the writer was tap-dancing around to avoid telling us what was actually said, I just assumed it must be the horrible, terrible, never-to-be-uttered (by White folks, that is) &#8220;N-word&#8221;, which we&rsquo;re not even allowed to use on here.</p>
<p> But, no, lo and behold, it was just a word for what amounts to a very large farm. Maybe &#8220;pancakes&#8221; will become the next &#8220;racially insensitive word&#8221; because Aunt Jemimah made them.</p>
<p> And by the way, whatever happened to &#8220;tenure&#8221; for college professors? I&rsquo;ll bet if he&rsquo;d been accused of committing plaigiarism (oops! Racially insensitive! Martin Luther King!) he&rsquo;d have been given much more due process than this bum&rsquo;s rush that Mr. Zaruba got.</p>

		<p>It sounds like Zaruba was trying to make some leftist analogy about blacks still being slaves or some other tripe.  I imagine people like him would be the first to roast a non-PC conservative student or colleague, so I will shed no tears for him.</p>

<p>Not really, it&rsquo;s been like this for a very long time.  And will continue to be, until the lawsuits start coming.  If there&rsquo;s one thing these snooty PC types understand, it&rsquo;s the prospect of losing all of THEIR money.</p>

		<p>Whites are now second class citizens. We alone are denied the ability to use some words that others may use at their choosing, or in their art. Why is it that the sword only cuts one way? Because to do otherwise would validate the concept that whites have a unique identity, and their culture and values must also be recognized. Surely that will not be allowed to happen&hellip; </p>

		<p>Oh, please.  Just because somebody gets offended at something said by another is reason enough to fire the speaker?  We need to toughen our skins and grow up here.  I was taught by my SoMO mom that, &#8220;Honey, if you gonna takce offense, don&rsquo;t let the gate hit&rsquo;che in th&rsquo;**s on the way out!&#8221;  In other words, if you take offense, be willing to pay the consequences.  And BTW, did anybody see the old episode of &#8220;South Park&#8221; called &#8220;Mr. Hanky, the Christmas Poo?&#8221;  It&rsquo;s about a town in which one person got offended at the Christmas play of the birth of Jesus at the local school - and the &#8220;getting offended&#8221; escalated until everyone in town was offended by something, so they ended up having a Christmas play that offended no one and it was really horrible - and it took Mr. Hanky, who is an animated piece of poo, to tell the people that they should focus on what&rsquo;s RIGHT in the world instead of on what&rsquo;s wrong.  I say people who get offended by socalled racial remarks need to grow up, get past it, and focus on the good around them instead of always pointing fingers and squalling about what they perceive as bad.</p>

		<p>Whatever is this forbidden incantation that the benighted Professor spoke aloud?  Abracadabra?  Shazaam?  Wop bop-a-lu-bop, a bop bam boom?  And why did the skies not darken?<br>
     On a lighter note, would this man have defended another professor who used the same deadly word?  Not likely, given that he thinks it&rsquo;s &#8220;absolutely transgressive&#8221;.  Suck it in, Mr Zaruba.  It&rsquo;s too late to be hiding behind free speech and moaning about political correctness, the First Amendment does not apply on any campus in the country, and hasn&rsquo;t for a decade or more.  </p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I will NEVER use that term again&hellip;&rsquo;&#8221;  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late, Mr. Zaruba; you are branded for life.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the racial slur [is] &#8216;NEVER, NEVER, NEVER to be used anywhere on campus.&rsquo;&#8221;  </p>
<p>Nor anywhere else in the free world.  This TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE word must be exterminated and the term &#8220;African-American&#8221; is to be substituted in all applications.</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not a big deal if the person using THE WORD is &#8220;the right color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course this is obviously a violation of Zaruba&rsquo;s civil rights, if he gets canned for using a word that people of the proper pigmentation can sling about with impunity.  Some people call that &#8220;discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s a violation of his civil rights that he&rsquo;s been canned for speech PERIOD.</p>
<p>Of course none of this matters in a country where white males effectively cannot file discrimination claims.</p>

		<p>COMMENT #9&hellip;you are wrong..we must not give into this pc nonsense. thats what they want us to do. there is still free speech in this country, and they are not going to decide what words i can use and not use. as long as they are in the english language, we can use em!!! if we continue to back off of words that are ligitimate, then we continue to be shrinking violets. when anyone tells you that you cant use a word, then make an issue of it, even if it causes a public disturbance, and tell them right up front that they have no right to tell you what words you can use. grow some backbone. also as for the teacher, he is a groveler and he has fell victim to his own pc supported positions. good!! when he has no paycheck maybe he will realize what he has done to himself. when whites start that pc stuff with me and they start trumpeting diversity, or multiculturalism, i always ask them what all-white gated community do they live in? do not defend, attack, attack, and dont let up.  </p>

		<p>The liberal PC police have magic words and you have to learn which ones you can use, when to use and when not to use them and in what context.</p>
<p>Aside from magical word usage, the PC liberal handbook says you are not allowed to hate anyone and you must embrace and tolerate everything and everyone even if it defies common sense, it repulses you or threatens your personal safety.<br>
 <br>
Mr Zaruba forgot the PC &#8220;escape clause&#8221;. All he had to say was he &#8220;misspoke, it was taken out of context and he was only trying to create some dialog on the issue.</p>

		<p>Something odd here.  The Black Student Union and Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle are withholding judgement, but the department chair has tossed him.  I get a sense that  Stuart Stein feels a need to be Blacker than the Blacks.  That or he fears the consequences of being accused of tolerating &#8220;racism&#8221;.  </p>
<p>BTW, anyone who thinks that a college campus is some kind of plantation probably doesn&rsquo;t have much experience doing physical work.  Higher education may be a fraud, but it&rsquo;s not forced labor.  </p>

		<p>The professor in question is a complete idiot, when facing charges such as his, &#8220;confession&#8221; and apology are not a winning strategy. Either you will be fired or not, apologies will not get you out of a jam. When it comes to the Bantus,  apologizing is a real bad idea. Bantus do not see apologies as signs of contrition,remorse and a willingness to make amends, but instead as a sign of weakness that will invite aggression, just like running from a menacing dog you will get bitten on the backside.</p>

		<p>Geez, I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;<br>
What&rsquo;s wrong with a plantation?<br>
All sorts of useful crops are grown on one, ranging from evil tobacco to nice corn and wheat. The people that work on said plantations are occupying their time in gainful labour that results in the sustainance of the nation!<br>
I&rsquo;m going to bandy that &#8220;P&#8221; word all over the place!</p>
<p>Post 10:<br>
&ldquo;Are we in for another state of McCarthyism?&rdquo;<br>
 <br>
The fundamental difference is that the people McCarthy accused ACTUALLY WERE communist sympathizers and agents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. You&rsquo;d really think anyone with a half-a-brain would know that by now. Communist agents and agitators were all over the place&hellip;don&rsquo;t take heed of what the television tells you.<br>

I wrote an email to the reporter asking what he said.  It was the &#8220;n-word&#8221; (I hate using that euphamism but don&rsquo;t want to trigger web-filters).  The reporter said the newspaper made a deliberate decision not to repeat the slur.  To me it just made everything really confusing.</p>

		<p>I think it was good and right to fire that raciss&rsquo; art teacher.  Even though his momma married a black man (who used the slur all the time), it was inexcusable for Zaruba to use it, even if he didn&rsquo;t direct it at blacks.</p>
<p>Now to maintain a uniform policy, everyone else on campus who utters a racial slur of any kind must be fired or expelled.  Any blacks who use the &#8220;N&#8221; word will immediately be dismissed.  &#8220;Cracker&#8221; is also grounds for dismissal, as well as &#8220;Whitey&#8221; and hundreds of other insensitive and offensive slurs.  At the end of the day, only sensitive white liberals will be left, and the university&rsquo;s can be closed for lack of enrollment.</p>

<p>Maybe he will become wiser and be on his own side from now on.  </p>

		<p>In an article in the Washington Post [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/college-inc/2010/03/towson_provost_speaks_on_zarub.html] the writer indicates that &#8220;Zaruba, using a racial slur for African Americans, told the class he was a &#8220;(expletive deleted) on the corporate plantation,&#8221; a reference to his status as a part-time faculty member without tenure or upward mobility. Zaruba is white. &#8220;</p>
<p>Later in the article Towson Provost Marcia Welsh had this to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Towson University strongly supports and upholds academic freedom in the classroom and across our learning community; however, such patently offensive language on the part of university employees will not be tolerated and does not reflect our value system.&#8221;</p>

<p>You believe anything a reporter for a newspaper would have to say? The jokes on you. As for McCarthy, all you have to do is look at the state of the world when McCarthy was considered a reputable senator (associated with the un american activities commission) who had something interesting to say, and who was trying to warn us all, and look at the world today, now that every publishing medium in the country officially refers to him as an abomination, and in fact his name has become a slur word. There&rsquo;s no comparison between then and now. Obama is the last hope for their dream, I think. Then again, wilful ignorance and an inaccurate understanding of the past are powerful forces too. As the last hope, I really wonder if there is a lot riding on Obama and if the left really has an emotional attachment to him. We shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate any attachment (and so avoid some of the Obama put-downs?). I think Obamas going to &#8216;succeed&rsquo; - and the left with him. And what a mess we are in. At least succeed in the short term.</p>

<p>Or was it &#8220;plantation&#8221;?  Is that now a bad word too? Something that whites are not allowed to say (although his black step-father could).</p>

		<p>35 Anon: &#8220;N@##$% on the corporate plantation&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve heard that song before.  Around 1969, there was a long article published as a pamphlet, called The Student as N@##$%.  There must have been a hundred thousand copies printed, I even saw junior SDS kids waving it around on high school campuses.  I don&rsquo;t know how many people read it, but the gist was that middle class kids were oppressed by the system, and needed to join with all other oppressed people, to, to, uh,&hellip;stick it to the Man.   <br>
     After a loose hippie chick and a good marijuana connection, what every White radical kid wanted was a Black friend to establish his credibility as a right on dude.  The proof of one&rsquo;s credibility was that you were so tight with the brothers that you could use the N-word among them.  That doesn&rsquo;t fly anymore, but this art professor has been living in the past.  Oh well, maybe he&rsquo;s still got a loose hippie chick and a good marijuana connection.  </p>

<p>This is a hoot.  Most post modern humanities professors <i>pride</i> themselves on their &#8220;transgressive&#8221; stances.  By this they mean their contempt for conventional standards on behavior, particularly of a sexual nature.  In reality those professors are craven conformists, not deviating one iota from the requirements of political correctness.</p>
<p>Anyhow, was the transgressive word &#8220;n****r&#8221; or is there now some other word so horrible that only rap singers are allowed to use it?<br>

		<p>Blacks refer to each other with this word constantly and they are never chastised.  This means blacks believe they have exclusive rights to a common word in the English language.</p>
<p>Need I remind anyone that the English language was conceived by whites?  Has anyone forgotten that African blacks never even evolved a written language of their own?  </p>
<p>As the Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary definition below points out, the word means &#8220;black&#8221;.  If blacks believe whites are going to refer to blacks exclusively as &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; they are delusional&hellip;  </p>

<p>I wonder what would happen to any professor who made a remark like that today?  Of course maybe he could get away with it.  How many Blacks would realize that a 100 IQ is just average for a White person.<br>

<p><br>
No. But many like to delude themselves that they are &#8220;French&#8221;. Simply French. Especially they are well educated, they&rsquo;re glad to drop the African past. They are encouraged in this fantasy by the French,  given the official insistence on assimilation and that everyone here is simply &#8220;French&#8221;.   </p>
<p>But, very oddly, some now consider themselves &#8220;African-American&#8221;;  and there are clothing stores, beauty parlours, etc. advertising African-American styles and products. Even to people who&rsquo;ve never set foot in America!   This new term has become so common that they apparently think African-American is the name of a race!  That&rsquo;s the best sense that I can make of it.  There&rsquo;s all kinds of nonsense going on.  A couple of days ago (here in Paris) I rode past a place named &#8220;Juju Love&#8221;.   I&rsquo;ll have to go back to check it out.  It&rsquo;s in the wedding gown district.  Who knows what products they&rsquo;re selling?</p>

<p>I thought the Orwellian part was where the university pat&rsquo;s itself on the back for their promotion of free speech even as they fire a prof for speaking one word. In fact, the univeristy press report leads off with that. I think both ideas are in one sentence. Perhaps this is not the place to send your child in search of the truth?</p>
