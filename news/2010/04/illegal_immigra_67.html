<h1>Illegal Immigrants Plan to Leave Over Ariz. Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Lee Myers, Yahoo! News, April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many of the cars that once stopped in the Home Depot parking lot to pick up day laborers to hang drywall or do landscaping now just drive on by.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s sweeping immigration bill allows police to arrest illegal immigrant day laborers seeking work on the street or anyone trying to hire them. It won&rsquo;t take effect until summer but it is already having an effect on the state&rsquo;s underground economy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many day laborers like Diaz say they will leave Arizona because of the law, which also makes it a crime to be in the U.S. illegally and directs police to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Supporters of the law hope it creates jobs for thousands of Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to drive day labor away,&#8221; says Republican Rep. John Kavanagh, one of the law&rsquo;s sponsors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law&rsquo;s supporters hope the departure of illegal immigrants will help dismantle part of the underground economy here and create jobs for thousands of legal residents in a state with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jose Armenta, a 33-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico&rsquo;s western coast, is already planning to move to Utah within the next 20 days because of a combination of the economy and the new law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Analysts say it&rsquo;s too soon to tell what lasting effects the law will have on the state&rsquo;s underground work force, which also includes baby sitters, maids and cooks.</p>
<p>A study of immigrants in Arizona published in 2008 found that non-citizens, mostly in the country illegally, held an estimated 280,000 full-time jobs. The study by researcher Judith Gans at the University of Arizona examined 2004 data, finding that they contributed about 8 percent of the state&rsquo;s economic output, or $29 billion.</p>
<p>Losing hundreds of thousands of unskilled laborers wouldn&rsquo;t hurt the state&rsquo;s economy in the short term, but it could limit the economy&rsquo;s ability to grow once it recovers, says Marshall Vest, director of the Economic and Business Research Center at the University of Arizona&rsquo;s Eller College of Management.</p>
<p>Legal workers who are willing to take any available job now will become more choosy if the unemployment rate falls back to low levels seen before the recession hit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some illegal immigrants, however, intended to stick around.</p>
<p>Natalia Garcia, 35, from Mexico City, says she and her husband  &mdash;  a day laborer  &mdash;  will stay so their daughters  &mdash;  both born in the U.S.  &mdash;  can get a good education and learn English. The couple have been living in Arizona illegally for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexico doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of opportunities,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Here, we work honestly, and we have a better life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The real reason mexicans are now fleeing arizona is that almost all of them are into selling or using drugs.  That is what immigration is all about&hellip;.funneling welfare money into the mexican drug market.</p>
<p>The real danger for these people is that the color of their skin now becomes probable cause.  Mexicans will now be routinely pulled over looking for illegal aliens.  But, in the process, will be caught with large amounts of illegal drugs.<br>

		<p>From the 2009 AZ population statistics, I gather that this (280,000 more full-time jobs) will mean that up to HALF of all unemployed AMERICANS in Arizona can now become gainfully employed.</p>

<p>Sorry for you and your liberal ilk, Amanda, but it won&rsquo;t hurt Arizona&rsquo;s economy in the <i>long</i> term, either.  No matter how you try to spin it, any state which purges itself of illegal criminals is not going to collapse.</p>
<p>But all of Arizona&rsquo;s neighboring states had better get busy and look out for their own.<br>
Those &#8220;immigrants&#8221; [sic] are going to be looking for other hosts very soon.<br>

		<p>I live in California where the illegal population is rampant, sometimes difficult to even order fast food without some knowledge of the Spanish language. I saw a story on the local news last night about a man that operates a steel fabricating business in Arizona who claims to have lost business because he had to fire a dozen illegal employees. I am sure he could find people to work for him if he were willing to pay more than slave wages. He claimed to have lost 4-5 million in the last year, with those kind of losses you&rsquo;d think he could afford good legal workers. The local white boys should take up the slack at the Home depot, if they are allowed to without a permit. There must be thousands of people willing to relocate for a decent job these days but the employers love paying minimum wage to illegals, who really don&rsquo;t work any harder than anyone else, I know, I&rsquo;ve worked with them. A Mexican was hired recently as a supervisor at a place where my girlfriends brother worked, her brother was fired and replaced by a Mexican. This is what we can expect from the Mexican takeover, and the politicians just tell us to shut up and like it. What ever happened to WE THE PEOPLE, telling the government what we want. </p>

		<p>An illegal immigrant making 20k under the table does not contribute enough tax money to pay for the public education her children receive.  </p>
<p>Mexican illegals should be forced to compete with European immigrants who are willing to work the same jobs in America for the same pay but are denied visas.  Just because they are our neighbors doesn&rsquo;t entitle them to be preferred over others.</p>

		<p>So now there is a law that makes it a crime to be in the US illegally. </p>
<p>For some strange reason I thought it was always a crime to do something that was illegal. I guess they were in a state of &#8220;Limbo&#8221; before, not quite legal but still not a crime. </p>
<p>No wonder the Mexicans can&rsquo;t learn English, nothing means what you would think it does. </p>

		<p>&#8220;but it could limit the economy&rsquo;s ability to grow once it recovers&#8221; - It&rsquo;s always the same&hellip; economy, economy, economy.. bring in more people to have greater GDP, creating more costs, greater spending and greater debt, thus creating the need for more people to work cheaper to &#8220;save&#8221; the economy.

		<p>At the risk of sounding too positive, I think it might elicit similar type laws in neighboring states.  On the down side, the illegal alien population may decide to demand their &#8220;rights&#8221; and riot which may make the liberals and others begin to grovel and beg for forgiveness for so much &#8220;racism&#8221;.  Hopefully the new law will act as a springboard for other states.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s happening in Arizona is amazing in that someone like the spirited and levelheaded Governor Jan Brewer, along with her fellow constituents, has finally made a major move on illegal immigration. Infelicitously, some proclaim it&rsquo;s too late. Maybe they are right. However, consider the current state of affairs in our country. Half the nation is fed up with the progressive roller coaster ride and desperately want to see something, anything, to reflect a more sensible change other than the so-called &ldquo;real change&rdquo; propagated by the left. Initiating this new law is a catalyst for restoration, and it comes as no surprise other neighboring states have quickly jumped on the bandwagon in considering similar measures. Arizona mustn&rsquo;t back down, especially now,  &mdash; not when these particular states are being energized by Arizona&rsquo;s lead. In my opinion, it can&rsquo;t be said enough how important it is for the Arizona governor and state lawmakers to stand their ground and not cave-in to the progressives, the protesters, and the state-controlled media. It&rsquo;s certainly not going to be easy.</p>

		<p>The good news is that illegal aliens are leaving Arizona.</p>
<p>The bad news is that they aren&rsquo;t going back to Mexico or Guatemala, they are simply moving to other states.</p>
<p>The really bad news is that although New York is a couple thousand miles away from Arizona, I have no doubt that many of them will come here, because all our politicians are Democrats or RINOs who will do nothing about illegal immigration other than create sanctuary cities and public benefits for them.<br>

		<p>These migrants had the courage, ambition and desperation to come here.  It couldn&rsquo;t have been easy for most of them.  NOw, let them go back to their home countries  and use those same qualities to make their countries better places to live.  They can do it.  It might take a revolution, but are Americans the only ones who are willing to fight for freedom and a better way of life?</p>

Unfortunately race seems to be at the forefront of the discussion on this law even though there are other issues that this law raises that are far more interesting and profound.  The most important issue in my opinion is the issue of status.  When someone enters the US illegally its probably reasonable to assume that they have bypassed normal visa controls for entering this country.  What this means is that someone who may not be allowed to enter the US, whether it be shop lifting or indicment for crimes against humanity in either Rwanda or Yugoslavia, has entered ths US.  Someone may be a sexual offender a member of a drug cartel yet law enforcement would be none the wiser under the circumstances if the said individual simply kept a &#8220;low profile&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The fact that we have no idea of who these people that enter the US are and are totally dependent upon their own truthfulness and honesty is problematic.  The issue of moral hazard arises, will a war criminal say &#8220;I&rsquo;m wanted for war crimes&#8221; if he is pulled over by the police on a simple traffic stop.  Its not likely.  </p>
<p>Even if he is pulled over and police are suspicious that someone may be a person of interest to law enforcement is there really anything they can do?  If someone is &#8220;illegal&#8221; they are off the radar it could be impossible to corrobate or verify their identity in a short period of time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this law is the answer but I think the question exists whether or not the law stands.  I would like to hear from someone in law enforcement how do you verify the status of someone who is &#8220;off grid&#8221;?   How do you find out who someone is if they haven&rsquo;t been pre screened through proper visa controls?</p>
<p>Race is a secondary issue status is the primary issue. </p>

		<p>Hopefully, after the illegals leave Arizona to other states, some of those other states will also hop on the bandwagon. Then, after a certain tipping point, there will be a rush in ALL the states to pass similar laws, because no state wants to be that last one- the one to which every illegal Mexican, from every other state, floods to&hellip;</p>

<p>Explain to me exactly how illegal colonists who drain the state&rsquo;s welfare, medical and educational system by pulling out FAR more than they pay in will &#8216;grow the economy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ed Rubenstein over at VDare.com writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The average low-income immigrant household &mdash; a category that includes illegal aliens and their U.S.-born children &mdash; receives an estimated $7,737 each year in kindergarten through grade 12 education services&hellip;. Medicaid, welfare, and other means-tested benefits for such households ($2,957.)&hellip; police and fire protection ($2,198), transportation ($572), unemployment insurance ($488), and sewer and utilities ($411).</p>
<p>Public education is by far the largest expense state and local governments incur on behalf of illegal aliens&hellip;. [including] the extraordinary costs associated with English language instruction and other services which illegals are far more likely to need than the &#8216;average&rsquo; student&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2eub2ra</p>
<p> State Senator Russell Pearce, is in the process of introducing Senate Bill 1097 which will require public schools to identify and count students who are in the country illegally. The bill also requires Arizona&rsquo;s Department of Education to determine the cost of educating such students and to research the &#8216;adverse impact&rsquo; of their enrollment.</p>
<p>This should have been mandated as a part of  Plyler v. Doe in 1982, but better late than never.  The results of Senate Bill 1097, if it becomes law, should then be shouted from mountain tops and publicized far and wide (yeah, with the current msm?).  </p>
<p>Let the people of Arizona know how much of their tax dollars is going to educate foreign nationals and the children of foreign nationals. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope this Prairie Fire sweeps across the nation before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The &#8220;underground economy&#8221; is primarily drugs, guns, and sex slaves.  If the media were honest in describing it that way, VERY few Americans would want the &#8220;underground economy&#8221; to flourish.</p>

<p>Yes, it is absolutely amazing that millions of White Californians have fled California, because of its decent into multicultural-chaos and economic and environmental decline. And yet, a great many of these brainwashed liberal Californians who settled in all the surrounding Western states still toe the party line about the great benefits of diversity.  </p>
<p>These liberal Californians have ruined the West.  Before 1970, much of the Western USA from Montana to New Mexico was empty, peaceful, and beautiful.  Now it is filled with &#8220;miracle-miles&#8221; condos, fast food restaurants, &amp; strip malls, just like California.  The Californians sold their million-dollar homes, moved to the surrounding states, and then simply out-competed the locals (who make only $20 to $40 thousand a year)for real estate. 4-generation families in New Mexico, Montana, &amp; Colorado have been displaced by spoiled, snooty, liberal Californians.  That is why you see &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Californicate Oregon&#8221; bumper-stickers, and why the &#8220;locals&#8221; hate Californians. </p>

		<p>30 Anonymous, don&rsquo;t blame us refugees.  I&rsquo;m sympathetic for the people who have been outbid for property in their own hometowns, the same thing happened within the state, all along the central coast.  Many of us would have stayed home if we could.  <br>
     But whenever I hear that &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Californicate&#8221; business, I ask, &#8220;How did YOUR congressman vote on immigration for the last 30 years?&#8221;  YOUR politicians allowed MY state to be invaded.  <br>
     And don&rsquo;t blame us for strip malls and fast food, they have them in Ohio and Georgia too.  </p>
