<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/apr/04/sats-marking-race-stereotypes">Black Pupils &#8216;Are Routinely Marked Down by Teachers&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anushka Asthana, Toby Helm and Tracy McVeigh, Guardian (London), April 4 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black children are being systematically marked down by their teachers who are unconsciously stereotyping them, it has been revealed.</p>
<p>Academics looked at the marks given to thousands of children at age 11. They compared their results in Sats, nationally set tests marked remotely, with the assessments made by teachers in the classroom and in internal tests. The findings suggest that low expectations are damaging children&rsquo;s prospects.</p>
<p>The study concludes that black pupils perform consistently better in external exams than in teacher assessment. The opposite is true for Indian and Chinese children, who tend to be &#8220;over-assessed&#8221; by teachers. It also finds that white children from very poor neighbourhoods were under-assessed when compared with their better-off peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is worrying is that if students do not feel that a teacher appreciates them or understands them, then they are not going to try so hard,&#8221; said Simon Burgess, professor of economics at the University of Bristol and co-author of the report. His study finds that the differences are a result of stereotyping, as opposed to other factors, and are particularly pronounced in areas where there are fewer black children  &mdash;  or fewer children from very poor estates.</p>
<p>The issue of testing is top of the agenda this weekend as the National Union of Teachers urges its members to vote to boycott the Sats test for 11-year-olds this summer. They believe the external tests are distorting education and should be replaced by teachers&rsquo; assessments. Yesterday, the union used its annual conference in Liverpool to threaten the next government with a &#8220;summer of discontent&#8221; over public spending cuts and national curriculum tests.</p>
<p>But Burgess, who is director of the Centre for Market and Public Organisation at the university, said his study showed that the tests were the only opportunity some children had to &#8220;prove their teachers wrong&#8221;. He argued: &#8220;These findings suggest that going down the route of abolishing key stage tests at age 11 would be a bad idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ed Balls, the secretary of state, said concerns about stereotyping were one reason he did not want to abolish the tests. &#8220;There are still schools, particularly in white, working-class communities, where the attitude is &#8216;the children here don&rsquo;t do so well, we do the best with what we have got, aspirations aren&rsquo;t high&rsquo;,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>But teachers rejected the argument yesterday. John Bangs, of the National Union of Teachers, said that if there was stereotyping it should be tackled by improving teacher training so teachers could better assess children themselves  &mdash;  not by retaining Sats. And Mick Brookes, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, which is also calling on members to back the boycott, said there were ways of moderating teacher assessment to make it more reliable.</p>
<p>Gloria Hyatt, a former secondary headteacher of black-Caribbean and Irish heritage, said the study confirmed a longstanding complaint made by ethnic minority groups. She now works as an education consultant helping schools to get the best potential out of those who might be &#8220;deemed as failures&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not discrimination or racism,&#8221; said Hyatt. &#8220;It is something unconscious. What this study shows is that what we see and what we experience influences our beliefs, attitudes and perceptions. We are conditioned by society, in terms of what comes out of the television about minorities, what we see in books. That says that &#8216;this is the model&rsquo; and then experiences reinforce that.&#8221; Hyatt argued that it was hard to go against those pervasive generalisations.</p>
<p>She said she had met teachers who believed &#8220;all black children are great at sport&#8221; and less able in &#8220;English, maths and science&#8221;. She argued that a &#8220;training tool&#8221; was needed. &#8220;Equal opportunities legislation will not fix this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it emerged that the three biggest teaching unions and leaders of the NUS Black Students Campaign have written to the Equality and Human Rights Commission demanding an audit of Britain&rsquo;s schools and universities to uncover race inequality in education. The letter points to the &#8220;disturbingly&#8221; low numbers of black teaching staff in primary and further education. It says that the London Metropolitan University had more black students than the country&rsquo;s top 20 universities put together.<br>

		<p>Without knowing any of the specifics here, I think there is something wrong with the &#8220;Sats&#8221; test.  It has to be blessedly simple for so many black students to do better in it than their grades in school would suggest.  </p>

They should have their own schools in their own countries of origin so they can give them any grades they like.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re comparing them to whites, they&rsquo;re always going to be marked down because of their achievement levels.</p>

		<p>I teach in a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; college and I always go into semesters color-blind, just grading papers by content alone and actively avoiding placing a name (or ever gender) to a paper or test. <br>
Without fail the stereotypes manifest themselves as the semester wears on. <br>
Actually not always, one course had a very bright, lighter-skinned African girl who did very well. And that&rsquo;s another thing with the Africans, the lighter, the brighter!<br>
The Asians are always great, the Whites are somewhere between great and fair-to-middlin&rsquo;, and the Jews are always pretty darned smart.<br>
And again, I actively avoid classifying according to ethnicity or gender when assessing grades. I assiduously avoid looking at names when grading. Its when I look up from my paperwork that I see the same patterns emerge.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that blacks in general and mexicans (the unintelligent asians) are not up to the task of making it through the white educational system. Through no fault of their own, they are forced to make their way through an environment that overtaxes their abilities. In the same way we recognize that Johnny is not college bound, it should be recognized that many colored people are not equipped to be formally educated.<br>
 <br>
Instead, we blame the racist white teachers for not properly doing their jobs. There seems to be a trend starting of firing teachers in low performing schools. I wonder how the white teachers are going to respond if this trend continues. The ones I&rsquo;ve seen so far look like deer caught in the headlights. In the meantime we will continue to generate a seething mass of humanity that will be at our throats at the soonest opportunity. <br>

		<p>Allow me to offer an alternative explanation&hellip;.</p>
<p>What the article didn&rsquo;t claim was that the black kids are doing BETTER than the white kids or the asian/indian kids on the exam.</p>
<p>What it did say was that they were doing better in the exam than they usually do in class&hellip; </p>
<p>Could it be possible that the asian/indian kids, as a result of the family pressures, do well in class because they are disciplined and work hard? And they do worse in the exam because the exam is tilted towards how they perform over the course of a few hours compared with how well they do on homework after being forced by their parent to spend hours and hours on it?</p>
<p>And applying the same reasoning to the black kids, they are forced to sit still for more than 5 minutes to do an exam, and lo and behold, they actually do better than when they are goofing around in the classroom.</p>
<p>Make sense? It&rsquo;s not racism, and it&rsquo;s not &#8220;something unconscious&#8221; - it&rsquo;s just how the kids are. Why would a teacher mark a black kid down undeservedly in the politically correct hellhole that is the UK? But of course, the solution put forward is that the teachers must be blamed and more money must be thrown at the problem.</p>

		<p>Aaaah, the old chestnut rolls awkwardly into the arena again&hellip;&rsquo;What do we do about poor academic achievement by black pupils in British schools?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As our beloved leader, Gordon Clown would say, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a global problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there we have it - throughout the world in Australia, France, Germany, America, et al, we have the same situation.  Academically, some races do less well than other races. Truth to tell, indigenous white pupils in Britain&rsquo;s schools and colleges do less well than their Indian and Chinese classmates. </p>
<p>Hence, the White Guardianistas immediately cry shamedly that it must be our fault - our teachers, our government, our culture, our racism, our history of slavery, our lack of concern.  We should all hang our heads in shame, we are all responsible&hellip;..ad nauseam.</p>
<p>Some people are more intelligent academically than others - doctors are more intelligent than politicians, politicians in motivational and intellectual terms are similar to  pigs around a trough, Guardian readers are more naive than other members of the public, who live closer to the major areas of concern in our society.   C&rsquo;est la vie.</p>
<p>Still, you say&hellip;&#8221;When the BNP get in power, all this will change.&#8221;  Sorry, but no.<br>
The BNP will not get far in the coming election - Britain&rsquo;s current troubles are far too complex for the BNP.  You see, some people are more intelligent and able to lead than others. </p>

		<p>The danger here is that teachers are being blamed for &#8216;unconscious&rsquo; bias.&rsquo;  This will subject them to endless hours of &#8216;social justice&rsquo; seminars to expose their latent racism.  And then the wheel turns&hellip;</p>

		<p> Grades should be based on actual test scores, not on some dim bulb teachers psychic ability to assess someones knowledge. Sort of like back when I attended high school,and some would recieve a&rsquo;s on most all their tests and would be given a c or lower on what they called the effort grade. Obviously they had tried hard enough to get whatever grade they made, else they&rsquo;d have gotten something else, ya think?</p>

		<p>There is not enough information in the article to form an opinion. The writers have edited the information to manipulate the reader and reinforce stereotypes. The Guardian, like the BBC, gives a higher priority to &#8220;educating&#8221; rather than informing its audience. <br>
It could be very, very interesting to see the raw data, if this is a serious study. </p>

		<p>Not to worry: Blacks in Britain will endure anything just to breathe British air. Say or do anything to them and it makes naught a difference. Sure they will whine and attempt to receive special treatment, but that&rsquo;s only because they know that leftists wrenched with anti-White guilt will accommodate them. Ever notice how a child can go instantly from a cry to a laugh? The lower intellect of Blacks allow them to brush off comments, most of which goes over their heads anyway. So don&rsquo;t worry but be vigilant because of their propensity for violence if angered. Best to ignore their rudeness.</p>

		<p>To poster #6.  Yes.  The firings of white teachers in low performing schools is a travesty.  The teachers are doing the best they can, but if you have kids who are FIVE grade levels behind in high school, how can you get them up to speed in nine months?</p>
<p>I taught for two years in a low performing, all non-white school.  The teaching staff was mostly white and the teachers all really worked real hard.  Some stayed 3-4 hours after school for free working with students.  But the students were too far behind to do any semblence of what high school used to be.</p>
<p>Even with all the differentiation and social justice gimmicks, the kids never really improved.  After about three months, all the teachers, even the young Teach for America recruits, just got on the band wagon of &#8216;collaboration&rsquo; sp the three or four decent students in the class could carry everyone else in &#8216;group projects.&rsquo;  If you would have seen the 12th grade &#8216;projects&rsquo; for example, you would have cried.  (Second graders could do better.)</p>
<p>Real reform is not impossible.  The only problem is that the enablers are in charge and they want to fire any teacher, especially if they are older and/or white, who wants to hold kids accountable (truly accountable) and grade them according to their ability and products.  </p>
<p>This grading on &#8216;effort&rsquo; and student &#8216;portfolios&rsquo; instead of Regents is another nail in the coffin of future failure.  I didn&rsquo;t go to school all that long ago, and I never remember doing any poster board projects after about 3rd grade.  We read and wrote and did rote work all the time, and me and all my colleagues turned out just fine.</p>
<p>True reform for minority education would emcompass more focus on remediating low skills until improvements are made.  Not throwing kids in grades for which they are unprepared for work and then blaming the teachers for not being miracle workers.  Data manipulation is another problem, but for another day.</p>

		<p>It seems that I read all sorts of articles coming out of Britain in which white pupils are constantly criticized, especially white boys.  I find this very disturbing.  I think I may have even read one article that put them below black pupils.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Truth to tell, indigenous white pupils in Britain&rsquo;s schools and colleges do less well than their Indian and Chinese classmates.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw this mentioned in the article as well, and I personally don&rsquo;t see why white students both in Britain as well as the rest of the white world can&rsquo;t perform as well as Indians.  I find this disturbing, and sometimes I wonder if the articles that claim this are just being politically correct.  </p>
<p>Rushton has done extensive work comparing not just India&rsquo;s IQ overall to those of whites worldwide (81 vs. 100) but also that of these so called intelligent cream of the crop Indians who immigrate to our countries.  Even within those studies Rushton was able to prove quite easily that immigrant Indians have lower IQs than the native white populations they live among.  He did extensive studies among university students as well.  He came up with plenty of data proving that the most educated whites of Britain are smarter than the most educated Indians who come there as immigrants.</p>
<p>What is going on here?  Why can&rsquo;t white students in Britain do as well as Indians, and why are there so many articles that come out of that country putting white (specifically male) students down all the time?  It seems like this political correctness garbage is a little more intense in Britain than the U.S., even, when it comes to what goes on in their schools. Something isn&rsquo;t adding up here with their &#8220;facts&#8221;. </p>

<p>Of course it most be the fault of evil racist Whitey. Never could anyone actaully put the reason down to the students.<br>
We must keep beating the same tired old drum&hellip; it&rsquo;s all racism, it&rsquo;s all racism&hellip;.</p>

<p><br>
Read the article carefully. It isn&rsquo;t saying that the &#8220;most intelligent&#8221; white students cannot compete with the Indians or Chinese, it&rsquo;s saying that Indians as a group outperform whites as group in school in the UK. This is  hardly surprising given the effect of selection bias; only the smart Asians on average immigrate to white countries (a sample that is an inadequate representation of average Asian intelligence) while the native population of the host countries have an <br>
intelligence distribution that is less biased and more representative. In essence, the comparison is between apples and oranges.  </p>
