<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/apr/06/hispanic-prelate-named-l-archbishop/">Hispanic Prelate Is Named L.A. Archbishop</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Monica Martinez, Washington Times, April 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>San Antonio Archbishop Jose Gomez, the nation&rsquo;s sole Hispanic prelate, is now in line to become the nation&rsquo;s first Latino cardinal.</p>
<p>Pope Benedict XVI early Tuesday morning appointed Archbishop Gomez, 58, to take over the 5-million-member Archdiocese of Los Angeles upon Cardinal Roger Mahony&rsquo;s retirement, at age 75, in February 2011.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Archbishop Gomez&rsquo;s new title for the next year will be coadjutor archbishop of Los Angeles. He is expected to be named a cardinal in six years, when Cardinal Mahony turns 80 and no longer has voting rights in the College of Cardinals, which elects popes.</p>
<p>According to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Hispanics make up more than 35 percent of Catholics in the nation and 70 percent of the Los Angeles archdiocese. In a statement this morning, Cardinal Mahony said his diocese deserved to have a Latino as its next Catholic leader.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Archbishop Gomez is the nation&rsquo;s only bishop who is a member of the Opus Dei religious prelature, which is an influential Catholic canonical structure made famous by the movie &#8220;The DaVinci Code,&#8221; though the portrayal was widely criticized as wildly inaccurate.</p>

		<p>The ex-Mayor of Los Angeles and traitor,James Hahn, proclaimed, while he was serving as Mayor,that,&#8221;Los Angeles is a Mexican city.&#8221; So why not continue in the same vein and get an Arch bishop from Mexico? See how it works? Americans who are traitors set the tone, and the invaders do their work. Logical, no?</p>

		<p>Just the latest reason why I&rsquo;m leaving the Catholic church. </p>
<p>They were once an important standard-bearer for European whites, but in the last quarter century they&rsquo;ve become a global conglomerate, espousing ideas which have more to do with Marxist international socialism than human brotherhood.   </p>
<p>When something grows too large and ignores its core family, and when it loses its exclusivity and geographic connection, it is deviating from its path and is no longer worthy of representing the values of its founders. </p>
<p>The Church is busily making itself irrelevent to me and my concerns. </p>
<p>The Asatru Germanic Norse faith is making a comeback among whites, and the reasons are obvious.  You&rsquo;ll find me there.</p>

		<p>There is a local bishop who is a really nice guy, a Hispanic, who would be better than this pendejo.  I don&rsquo;t want to name him for fear of causing trouble for him - the Church has long arms.  But, I do Catholicism as I see fit, not as the schmucks in the Catholic hierarchy tell me I should.  Let&rsquo;s not forget that they elected a former Nazi (Hitler Youth) as Pope!!</p>

		<p>Instead of propagating and teaching those doctrines which make Catholics and Catholicism distinctively so, the Church since Vatican II  &mdash;  -and in the name of Vatican II, has been engaged in the &#8220;social Gospel&#8221;:  socialism, Marxism, feminism, racial &#8220;equality&#8221;, civil rights, ecumenism&hellip;in a word, anything and everything BUT, God forbid, proper Catholicism.</p>
<p>Mark my word. You will see.  When Gomez is installed as the head of the LA diocese, his &#8220;reign&#8221; will have not a thing to do with the Catholic Faith or Catholic doctrine.  Instead, he will be mired in handling sex abuse cases; promoting the further dilution of our erstwhile great American culture through illegal immigration; and being the standard-bearer of every leftist cause imaginable (i.e. Cesar Chavez), but it will certainly have nothing to do with catechizing his &#8220;own&#8221; or non-Catholics, in general&hellip;</p>
<p>To do that, of course, would be in the real spirit of real Catholicism  &mdash;  the pre-Vatican II type, something which is clearly anathema to these phonies&hellip;</p>

		<p>With pedophilia generally condoned among Hispanics, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, one wonders what new spins and stories we&rsquo;ll see coming out of the Catholic Church in Southern California when it comes to sexual predators among the clergy. </p>

<p>I hope you have good reasons unrelated to bad Vatican policies to abandon Christianity in its entirety. Otherwise, talk about a false dilemma! There are other Christian churches beside the Catholic one.</p>

		<p>This makes sense to me, the majority of Catholics in L.A. are Hispanic. Also if this encourages more Hispanics in the area to practice their religion it can only have good benefits for the whites and Hispanics that live there (i.e. reduction in crime and out of wedlock births).</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;.take over the 5-million-member Archdiocese of Los Angeles upon Cardinal Roger Mahony&rsquo;s retirement, at age 75, in February 2011&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Around here in S. California, he is known as Phony Baloney Mahony and Don Corleone Mahony.</p>
<p>Mahony should be retiring straight to a jail cell for his part in aiding, abetting and covering up for priests involved in sexual abuse.  Mahony knowingly transferred and/or accepted priests from other parishes that had abused children:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Evidence has shown Mahony harbored many known pedophile priests, some of whom went on to molest others. </p>
<p>Msgr. Richard Loomis testified that Mahony ordered him not to call the authorities.  Under oath in a deposition, Msgr. Richard Loomis, the former vicar of clergy for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, reluctantly told the story of how his boss handled in 2000 allegations of sexual abuse of two minors brought against Father Michael Baker.  Baker had admitted to Mahony in 1986 that he had molested two different boys; the priest remained in ministry, often unsupervised.) </p>
<p> Loomis testified that:</p>
<p>Mahony ordered him to ignore official archdiocesan policy and not inform parishes of the allegations.</p>
<p>Loomis wanted to contact law enforcement about Baker&rsquo;s allegations and behavior, but Mahony ordered him not to&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>When the trials were about to begin:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;two days before the first of 20 cases against the archdiocese, involving 172 accusers, was scheduled to go to trial, the cases were settled for 660 million, 30-40% of which went to the lawyers who handled the cases.  </p>
<p>Cardinal Mahony said Sunday that the archdiocese would pay $250 million toward the settlement, insurers would pay $227 million, religious orders would pay $60 million and the remainder, $123 million, would come from other sources&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yg5g638" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yg5g638</a></p>
<p>660 million is a tremendous sum to pay out to prevent Mahony from having to perjure himself on the stand.</p>
<p>Talk radio, the John &amp; Ken show on KFI and Doug McIntyre on KABC, pounded on this story relentlessly  &mdash;  and good thing they did otherwise we locals would know a lot less about what went on.  The LA Times, like Mahony is fervently pro-open borders and pro-amnesty.</p>
<p>New parishioners, and lots of them, especially those that don&rsquo;t speak English, are of low intelligence with little education, won&rsquo;t question the church and know nothing about the priest abuse scandals that Mahony covered up, are needed to re-fill church coffers after the 660 million dollar pay-out to lawyers and plaintiffs. </p>

		<p>4-Sonya: &#8220;&hellip;it can only have good benefits for the whites and Hispanics that live there (i.e. reduction in crime and out of wedlock births).&#8221; - Seeing how there are fewer and fewer Whites living in the LA area, crime against Whites will eventually be reduced to -zero- anyway.  The best thing for White people now is to have all of them move out of L.A. and place the U.S./Mexico border somewhere North of the area.  At this point in the game, I would consider that a benefit for White people.  Otherwise, why does anyone need religion in order to -not- be a criminal?  </p>

		<p>In the rest of the story, it claims that the Pope said he appointed Cardinal DiNardio of Texas in appreciation of the Mexican people. Cardinal DiNardio of Texas a Mexican? Could be?</p>
