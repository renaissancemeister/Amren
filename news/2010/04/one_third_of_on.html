<h1>One Third of Ontario Courtroom Translators Fail Proficiency Tests</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kirk Makin, Globe and Mail (Toronto), April 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One out of three Ontario courtroom translators failed proficiency tests administered by the Ministry of the Attorney-General last year.</p>
<p>Another third did poorly enough that they have been placed on probationary status by the ministry, Paul Burstein, president of the Criminal Lawyers Association, said Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Burstein said the figures were revealed recently by a ministry witness who was called to testify by Mr. Justice Casey Hill of Ontario Superior Court, who has expressed repeated concerns in the past about the quality of translation in the courts.</p>
<p>The CLA called for an inquiry into the ministry&rsquo;s response to the problem. It also urged the province to make a concerted effort to locate possible wrongful convictions caused by inadequate courtroom translating.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have had five years to fix the problem and all they have managed to do is devise a test that shows their efforts achieved a significant failing grade,&#8221; Mr. Burstein said in an interview. &#8220;Enough is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions with a high immigrant population, such as the Toronto suburb of Peel, interpreters are called to numerous courtrooms on a daily basis. Mr. Burstein said it is critical not just for witnesses to understand questions they are asked, but for defendants to properly instruct their lawyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask any defence lawyer who has ever done a trial involving an interpreter and they&rsquo;ll tell you that it is very common to have a witness give five or six sentences in a foreign language, and somehow the interpreter manages to distill it into three English words,&#8221; Mr. Burstein said. &#8220;You are not getting the evidence of the witness. What you are getting is a summary that the interpreter has made which may or may not be accurate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Burstein said that 77 of the 225 translators tested by the ministry last June failed outright. &#8220;It seems to me the simplest place to start is take the 77 interpreters who failed the test, trace back and find what trials they were on, locate the convictions and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. assess whether there may have been a miscarriage of justice,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The issue came to a head in 2005, when Judge Hill issued a judgment that was critical of translation facilities. Mr. Burstein said the 34 per cent who failed the test have since lost their accreditation; the 31 per cent who did poorly enough that they are conditionally accredited are undergoing further training and being used primarily for less complex cases.</p>
<p>None of 31 new recruits who were among those tested qualified for accreditation, Mr. Burstein said.</p>
<p>Ministry spokesmen could not be reached for comment Monday night.<br>

<p>It seems contageous!  Check your own English grammar in your above posting.  (Hint, your second sentence is an imcomplete sentence, it lacks a subject).</p>
<p>This is a good example of white hypocrisy and the need for whites to improve themselves if they hope to save themselves.  Carrying on like this is no more than throwing rocks in a glass house.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised. Being fluent in two languages is one thing, being able to translate effectively from one language to another requires an additional level of competance. </p>
<p>The important aspect is that Canada has such a great need for interpreters in their legal system, i.e. why are there so many &#8220;Canadians&#8221; who are fluent neither in French or English? Answer: Canada&rsquo;s insane immigration policies.</p>

		<p>Back in 1993 I was called up to serve for jury duty in Toronto. I observed about fifteen cases before I was picked. About half of the cases I saw involved Tamils and most of them involved stabbings, including multiple ones. They are a VIOLENT people. In every single case the trial had translators scheduled because nobody spoke adequate English. We were told this would at least automatically DOUBLE the length of the trial, some of which would routinely take five or six weeks anyways. Tamils spent most of last summer here blocking all of our roads because of their stupid cause back home. This cost the city millions. Just recently a shipload of them showed up on our west coast. Now they are all in Toronto and collecting welfare. They are the worst group of foreigners you could possibly have. </p>

		<p>Where I work, we have a lot of Spanish speakers from many different countries.  The more educated South Americans continually complain that the Spanish speakers from the Carribean and Mexico and Central America speak such poor Spanish it is hard for them to understand it.  Such people often have very little writing ability at all in Spanish, as well.  If a person is virtually illiterate in their native and adopted languages, how does this translate, pardon the pun, into a brighter, more prosperous future in a &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; society?</p>

<p>Not to be picky, but if you are going to pick on someone as a grammar police rep. check your own spelling first. No offense meant. </p>

		<p>COURTROOM <br>
Translators? Ontario?<br>
In the heartland state in which I live, the small town Courthouses often have court reporters/stenographers near the double digit IQ<br>
range, it would seem, and who being themselves  native speakers of English,<br>
can&rsquo;t &#8220;translate&#8221; their own native language into an accurate transcript of Court proceedings. Half of the jurisdictions, Luddite fashion, do not yet permit backup mechanical recording devices, although savy defendants in criminal preliminary hearings, acting<br>
pro se, will often &#8220;wire themselves&#8221; to this end.  <br>
A sidebar to this topic is the extent to which our rural small towns,dramatically brain-drained by migration to cities,  are turning into rural ghettos, a bit like out of Dickey&rsquo;s<br>
DELIVERANCE  &mdash;   all flat Caucasian faces, by the way.    </p>

		<p>Thanks Skip!  My comment was just dashed off quickly.  I never expected that one of my sentences would make me a hypocrite because of a grammar error.</p>
<p>By the way, I fully support the rights of illiterate white Americans to live in a white society where they can be free of brutality and discrimination arising from hordes of illiterate blacks and Hispanics.<br>

		<p>I deal with a variety of support calls as a normal part of my business. I&rsquo;m used to the South Florida &#8220;spanish&#8221; accents but I had one day this week with several calls to Indian and Chinese people living in the U.S. It took 2 to 3 times as long to resolve those calls because I had to ask people to repeat their themselves several times in order to determine the specifics of their issues.</p>
<p>At the end of the day I thought to myself how much does it cost this country having to  constantly deal with people who don&rsquo;t understand the native language.</p>
<p>You also lose the pleasure of dealing in the English language along with all the subtleties when speaking to someone who is searching for basic words. </p>
