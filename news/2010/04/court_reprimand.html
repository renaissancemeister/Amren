			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carri Geer Thevenot, Las Vegas Review-Journal, April 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Nevada Supreme Court publicly reprimanded a Las Vegas lawyer Friday for running a Spanish radio advertisement in 2008 that &#8220;grossly misstated the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the order, Anthony &#8220;Tony the Tiger&#8221; Lopez Jr. ran the 10-second advertisement on two radio stations in Las Vegas and one in Reno. It cost about $19,500 and ran for about three months.</p>
<p>The commercial told listeners: &#8220;If you have had an auto accident, by law you have the right to receive at least $15,000 for your case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The record demonstrates that the advertisement misled the public into believing that they had a right to $15,000 if they were involved in a car accident regardless of the merits of their case,&#8221; according to the Supreme Court order. &#8220;Moreover, as the State bar argues, Lopez&rsquo;s prior instances of misconduct evidence his disregard for the rules of professional conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Considering the amount of freebies already available to them, it&rsquo;s no surprising at all that they would have believed it.  I wonder how much other nonsense is propagated by these &#8220;Spanish radio&#8221; outlets.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Lopez&rsquo;s prior instances of misconduct evidence his disregard for the rules of professional conduct.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Oh, gosh, I&rsquo;ll bet that poor Se√±or Lopez is quivering in his boots at his &#8220;public reprimand.&#8221;  I hope the courts aren&rsquo;t too hard on the poor fellow.  That&rsquo;d be Racism.<br>

		<p>Wow the Nevada Supreme Court ordered the lawyer to run some public service announcements as a means of remedy for his misleading advertisements.</p>
<p>What the vast segment of the white population does not know is that lawsuits are used by the invisible hand to destroy the productive.</p>
<p>To own property and be sued is to enter Kafka&rsquo;s hell.  </p>
<p>In the lawsuit you will find no friend and very few honest members of the court.  </p>
<p>The court makes its money stripping you of yours.  </p>
<p>They do not care if you have children to care for or what their unlawful rulings cost you.  </p>
<p>They did not go to school to help you.  </p>
<p>The poor judges are the biggest losers of all.  They must go along with the corruption of the trial attorneys or be replaced.</p>
<p>Money is the only God and the lawyers and court reporters are experts at stealing it from you.</p>
<p>Those who do not believe the above have never been sued.</p>
<p>To be sued is to know the meaning of hopelessness.</p>

		<p>A few years back, I was in a very minor accident with my van and a car driven by a latino woman and her boyfriend.  There was zero damage to my van, and a small scrape on the side of her car.  </p>
<p>There was no sudden impact, no crash, nothing - just a side scrape on her rear door.  She had attempted to run a light that I had already stopped for, and I was gently moving into the right lane, which was empty at the time and so the side of her car and my van rubbed together as she careened by.</p>
<p>We all went to the police station together, because the cops we called said they don&rsquo;t come out for accident reports.  We both drove our vehicles to the station.  No one was hurt.  Damage to her vehicle was minor.  In any other place, it would be considered a no-fault accident and taken care of by one&rsquo;s own insurance companies.  </p>
<p>Six months later I get a letter from a lawyer saying I was being sued for $15,000 for what? - pain and suffering!</p>
<p>I was livid.  I had to go back to Chicago for a hearing, and both the Latinos had neck braces on and piles of medical bills for &#8216;therapy&rsquo; and such!  I am not making this up!  My brother-in-law, who was with me at the time of the accident, testified that while I and the woman were in the police station making the report, the woman&rsquo;s boyfriend decided to change the tire on her car and did so himself.  Why were neither of them in pain and debilitated for the 2 hours we were all together after the accident?</p>
<p>Needless to say, my lawyers decided to settle out of court, deeming a full trial more expensive, even though they assured me that this was an obvious scam.  The pair got $7500 for nothing!  So this story resonates with me here.</p>

		<p>Being up to my ears in &#8221; Hispanic lawyers,&#8221; I have found that any hustler with an o or an a at the end of his name will call hinmself Hispanic. Since most are third generation Hispanics [?], they speak the Spanglish they learned at home and the streets; however they never learn how to read or write it in a linguisticaly correct style. Tony most likely wrote the ad and left out modifying parts of it that would have made it okay. The only safe lawyer to hire if you want an Hispanic hustler is a lawyer who  graduated from a high school in Puerto Rico. The educational level of Puerto Rican schools surpasses all others this side of Havana. If some clown was raised in Hell`s Kitchen or any other barrio forget it. He is almost as worthless as an affirmative action special.<br>

		<p>Dear anonymous #3 comment-just remember-the problem isn&rsquo;t lawyers, educators, preachers, teachers, professors, judges, doctors, etc.-its LIBERAL lawyers, educators, preachers, teachers, etc. Liberals are the problem, and white liberals are more dangerous to our welfare than any so-called minority group. Don&rsquo;t fall for that old neocon trick of demonizing lawyers, while big Pharma charges all of us out the wazoo for prescription medications, while giving drugs away free in Africa, and doctors commit malpractice on your grannie because their doing surgery while jet-lagged from just getting back from another stint with &#8220;Doctors Without Borders&#8221;, or some other liberal charity. Notice how everything I complain about isn&rsquo;t directed so much at any profession so much as its directed at the liberalism that has infected all professions? As whites we need professions-our sons in particular need jobs where they can operate as &#8220;freebooters&#8221;-not under the thumb of some liberal affirmative action regime at a large company. Professions like law and medicine provide those options-without the professions and other &#8220;freebooter&#8221; options,  we&rsquo;ll have no means of securing a stable livlihood, but will be vulnerable to layoffs, firings, demotions and lack of promotions. You may not make as much money working for yourself, but one things for sure-you won&rsquo;t fire yourself. You can&rsquo;t be independent in thought and spirit if you are subject to the whims of others in authority over you, as you are when working for a big company. Be your own boss, so you can be a man!</p>

		<p>This article is pointing out a truth that most of you are missing-lawsuit abuse is predominantly a racial problem. What is the primary complaint fueling tort reform?-runaway juries, the kind that deliver million dollar verdicts for spilling a cup of hot coffee on yourself. Where do these verdicts come from?-venues with super majorities of minorities! These people can&rsquo;t be trusted to serve on juries, anymore than they can be trusted to vote responsibly. Majority white venues almost never have a problem with runaway juries, but you&rsquo;ll never hear this analysis from the mainstream press-its like the emperor&rsquo;s new clothes.</p>
