			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, April 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed tough immigration enforcement legislation (See FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Update, April 19, 2010) into law. Amnesty supporters have expressed outrage at the new law, which they claim is fueled by &#8220;anti-immigrant hysteria.&#8221; (See, e.g., AZFamily News, April 13, 2010).</p>
<p>Even before Governor Brewer announced she would sign SB 1070, amnesty proponents filled the airwaves and cyberspace with incendiary and hyperbolic rhetoric in an attempt to whip up opposition. Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, claimed the bill &#8220;appears to mandate racial profiling&#8221; (Los Angeles Times, April 13, 2010). Reform Immigration for America  &mdash;  an umbrella group of pro-amnesty organizations  &mdash;  radically claims that the bill &#8220;enshrines hate into our country&rsquo;s laws.&#8221; (See Reform Immigration for America&rsquo;s Blog). Another well-known pro-amnesty group, America&rsquo;s Voice, featured on its website a blog posting entitled &#8220;What the #$@!, Arizona?&#8221;, which claims that that the bill is &#8220;inhumane&#8221; and &#8220;would discriminate against Latinos.&#8221; (See America&rsquo;s Voice Blog, April 22, 2010). Not to be outdone, Cardinal Roger Mahony suggested that Arizonans were &#8220;now reverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby people are required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicion of documentation.&#8221; (Cardinal Roger Mahony Blogs L.A., April 18, 2010). The Rev. Al Sharpton has said that he is ready to travel to Arizona and march in the streets to protest the new law. (The Washington Post, April 25, 2010).</p>
<p>But, counter to these claims, Arizona&rsquo;s law provides a carefully crafted set of rules that proscribe how Arizona law enforcement officers are to inquire about immigration status. First, an Arizona law enforcement officer must engage in lawful contact with the individual in question. (SB 1070, §2). That means that the stop or contact must survive any challenge with respect to the 4th Amendment&rsquo;s protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Then, if an officer has conducted a lawful stop, the officer must also have &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; that an individual is unlawfully present before inquiring about immigration status. (Id.). Importantly, the Arizona law expressly states that a law enforcement official &#8220;may not solely consider race, color, or national origin&#8221; in implementing this provision, including forming a reasonable suspicion. (Id.)</p>
<p>Then, if an Arizona law enforcement officer has reasonable suspicion that the person is an alien unlawfully present in the United States, the officer must make a &#8220;reasonable attempt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person.&#8221; (SB 1070, §2). Importantly, SB 1070 creates a presumption of lawful presence if an individual presents: (1) a valid Arizona driver&rsquo;s license, (2) a valid Arizona I.D. card, (3) a valid tribal I.D. card, and (4) any valid federal or state I.D. that requires proof of legal presence before issuance. If the officer verifies with ICE that the person is an illegal alien the officer may (1) hold the alien for transfer to federal custody pursuant to an ICE detainer; if the officer has probable cause to believe the person &#8220;has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States,&#8221; the person may be arrested without a warrant. §6. Finally, SB 1070 requires that these provisions be implemented in a manner that is consistent with all federal immigration and civil rights laws. (Id.).</p>
<p>Commenting on SB 1070 Friday, President Obama first acknowledged that his administration has failed to stop illegal immigration, but then condemned Arizona  &mdash;  one of the states hit hardest by the federal government&rsquo;s failures  &mdash;  for attempting to find a solution: &#8220;Our failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona.&#8221;  (CNN, April 23, 2010). Calling the new law &#8220;misguided,&#8221; Obama then noted that he has &#8220;instructed members of [his] administration to closely monitor the situation and examine the civil rights and other implications of this legislation.&#8221; (Id.). Obama concluded: &#8220;But if we continue to fail to act at the federal level, we will continue to see misguided efforts opening up around the country.&#8221; (Id.). Obama&rsquo;s Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, has called the Arizona bill &#8220;misguided&#8221; as well. (ABC News, April 26, 2010).</p>
<p>Mexican officials have condemned the new law, as well. (The Hill, April 24, 2010). Noting that the government of Mexico had lobbied against passage of the Arizona bill, Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Patricia Espinosa said: &#8220;The government of Mexico regrets that, despite the overtures made at all levels by Mexican federal and state officials, the legislators who passed this measure and the governor of Arizona have not taken into account the valuable contributions of migrants to the economy, society and culture of Arizona and the United States of America.&#8221; (Id.). Espinsoa continued: &#8220;Criminalization is not the way to resolve undocumented immigration. The existence of cross-border labor markets requires comprehensive, long-term solutions. Shared responsibility, trust and mutual respect must be the bases for addressing the shared challenges in North America.&#8221; (Id.). In addition, the Mexican Senate passed a unanimous resolution urging Governor Brewer to veto the bill just prior to her signing it into law. (Id.).</p>
<p>A new poll from Rasmussen Reports indicates that the attitudes expressed by Obama and other opponents of the new law are not indicative of the attitudes of the people of Arizona. The poll found &#8220;70% of likely voters in Arizona approve of the legislation, while just 23% oppose it.&#8221; (Rasmussen Reports, April 21, 2010).  FAIR President Dan Stein commented on Governor Brewer signing the bill into law: &#8220;Faced with mounting costs, lost jobs and violent crime resulting from mass illegal immigration, Gov. Brewer has acted responsibly to protect Arizonans. In signing S.B. 1070, Gov. Brewer has responded to the will of the people and risen above the incendiary rhetoric of those who are maliciously attempting to divide Arizonans along ethnic lines.&#8221; (Press Release, April 23, 2010).<br>

		<p>It would appear that the law may be a good thing if the state of Arizona really enforces it.  It may serve as a precedent for other states to follow suit.  This may have an effect on the illegal population and make them decide to riot.  Unfortunately White people have to understand to keep their country, there&rsquo;s going to be an inevitable fight for survival.  Whites have been running for far too long.  It&rsquo;s time to turn and fight.</p>

		<p>70+% of Arizonans approve of the bill!!!  Now why is that?  It&rsquo;s because they KNOW from experience what it&rsquo;s like to live in a border state where illegals and drug dealers freely have crossed into their state, and have committed every crime known, from murder to assault to robbery to taking every bit of welfare they can from the state.  Arizonans know what it&rsquo;s like and they want no more of it!!  All these people whining and kvetching about the bill don&rsquo;t live in a border state, or if they do, they are part of the liberal entrenchment and don&rsquo;t care about the common people.  People who don&rsquo;t live in Arizona should shut up about it already and let them govern their state in the way they see fit.  After all, Arizona is only doing what Mexico does when an illegal comes into THEIR territory!!!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;A new poll from Rasmussen Reports indicates that the attitudes expressed by Obama and other opponents of the new law are not indicative of the attitudes of the people of Arizona. The poll found &ldquo;70% of likely voters in Arizona approve of the legislation, while just 23% oppose it.&rdquo; (Rasmussen Reports, April 21, 2010).&rdquo;</p>
<p>And one wonders, if the results in Arizona, do not reflect similar numbers in the country as a whole?</p>
<p>From what I remember, normally something like 75% to 80% of registered voters, have little to no sympathy with the (sanctimonious sigh) &ldquo;undocumented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an American, as a white majority preservationist, and as a human being with a brain: I ask you, is not the question of the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; our greatest strength. Every time, they start this openly genocidal nonsense, do they not lose. Moreover, they seem to think &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; diversity is a selling point away from the political disasters they &ldquo;thought&rdquo; were so important and avoidable. Sort of like, printing worthless &ldquo;money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for Comrade Obama and his Commissars!</p>
<p>However and as always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>We can&rsquo;t ignore what is going on in university classrooms. In many courses students are taught that controlling immigration by setting limits and enforcing laws can&rsquo;t be done in a democracy where individual rights are respected. Students are taught that science shows humans don&rsquo;t have any innate sense of national territory or that concerns over society being disrupted by demographic changes are baseless. Courses in fields like sociology, social work, anthropology, history, and cultural studies are especially prone to these false ideas. The legislators of Arizona should put together a brief teaching guide to counter these claims and require that it be taught in university classes. I don&rsquo;t think many of the professors will complain too much. They say that knowledge is a social construction anyway, so now it&rsquo;s time for Arizona legislators to construct some knowledge.</p>

		<p> Don&rsquo;t be fooled by all this &#8220;outrage,&#8221; marching, shouting and threatening about the amnesty stink bomb that Arizona has thrown into our midst. The bleeding hearts are secretly delighted   &mdash;   tickled pink, if not red   &mdash;   that Arizona&rsquo;s dilemma, and the action the state was forced to take by federal inactivity   &mdash;   has instantly erased all talk of the misbegotten health care bill that was rammed through Congress recently.</p>
<p> &#8220;Health care bill? What health care bill? We&rsquo;re talking hatred, racial profiling and xenophobia here! We can now don our cherished cloak of self-righteousness and moral superiority, and prate about how all conservatives and Republicans are actually nasty Nazis and KKK members.&#8221;</p>
<p> The Left has been galled beyond belief by the Tea Parties and other manifestations of middle-class, middle-aged, middle America finally waking up and flexing its muscles. &#8220;How dare they! Only we immature, idealistic, nothing-to-lose youth are allowed to march and protest!&#8221; You see, all Leftists see themselves as young and idealistic, even if they have gray hair and arthritis.</p>
<p> Now here come these bumptious &#8220;right-wingers&#8221; who are supposed to keep quiet and keep working and paying taxes, actually standing up on their hind legs and shouting, &#8220;We&rsquo;re mad as hell and we&rsquo;re not going to take it any more!&#8221; Oh, thinks the Left, what is America coming to?!</p>

		<p>Latino and white left-wing liars are comparing the situation in Arizona to Nazi Germany but they&rsquo;ve got it backwards.  The real &#8220;nazis&#8221; are the Mexicans who are treating the American southwest the way Hitler treated Poland.  Mexicans call themselves a people without borders.  That has a nice fascist ring to it doesn&rsquo;t it. </p>

		<p>This is a wonderful law. I live in Az. and I am proud of my state. But I&rsquo;m deathly afraid Obama and Holder will somehow have it overturned. Obama&rsquo;s plan is to legalize illegals so they can vote Democratic, thus insuring Obama a second term. Thus Obama can&rsquo;t let this common sense, state saving measure stand. Then there is the ultra liberal ninth circuit court. They will probably overturn the law if Obama can&rsquo;t. The Arizona law is carefully written so as to withstand challenge but I&rsquo;m afraid Obama will find a way to destroy it. He simply can&rsquo;t allow this to happen. If by some chance the law prevails, all other states owe Arizona a huge debt, for it will give them  the understading that they don&rsquo;t have to suffer from illegals either. So the ramifications of this law are far reaching indeed. But again, we all know that something too good to be true usually isn&rsquo;t true. </p>

		<p>I have come to the realization that &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; are the new &#8216;n&rsquo; words FOR WHITES.</p>
<p> We are a RACIAL minority in a number of states that La Raza (&#8216;the Race&rsquo;- how&rsquo;s THAT for &#8216;racist&rsquo;?) have targeted for &#8216;repatriation and reconquista&rsquo; [re-conquest!] - among them, the sovereign state of Arizona.</p>
<p>Yet NOWHERE does our &#8216;post-racial&rsquo; president (and I use the term loosely) seem to care one whit about THAT &#8216;minority&rsquo; of which I am a member. Indeed, it would appear that Marxist rhetoric, Gramscian subervsion tactics, and Alinskyite radicalism are the modus operandi of this whole Democratic administration!</p>
<p>I absolve any and all who feel &#8216;threatened&rsquo; and &#8216;hurt&rsquo; by the &#8216;ethnic slurs&rsquo; of &#8216;racist,&rsquo; &#8216;honky&rsquo;, &#8216;gringo&rsquo; and the NEW &#8216;n&rsquo; word, Nazi - all used ONLY OF WHITE PEOPLE. You have not sinned. You are only awakening to the reality of the H8 they are using against YOU!</p>
<p>I refuse to be guilted into being sorry for God&rsquo;s election of me to the White Race of Christendom!!</p>

		<p>Just WHO are amnesty supporters anyway? Other than the Mexican parasites, their La Laza and a bunch of deluded White liberal fools? Last weekend, shopping at the local Wal-Mart, caught sight of three Mestizos, helping themselves to five-finger discounts. While the Wal-Mart security team was either asleep or out to lunch. I crack up whenever I read a news blurb that Wal-Mart is suffering from excessive &#8220;shrinkage&#8221;. The chain actually seems AFRAID to prosecute these Latino thieves.</p>

		<p>Why should we care what Cardinal Mahony and the other fools say or think? We learned long ago, what a bunch of thieving parasites the majority of illegals turned out to be. The crime rate in Phoenix is still sky high, driven by illegals who need to get their hands on some quick cash for the next stage of their trip.</p>

		<p>We are being invaded by foreign nationals and an invasion is an act of war.</p>
<p>It is not illegal to shoot enemy invaders on sight.  </p>
<p>It matters not that Mexicans aren&rsquo;t infiltrating our country armed and in uniform if the end results (occupation and conquest) are the same.</p>
<p>The only way to drive them out and keep them out is to take up arms against them.</p>
<p>And as sure as you&rsquo;re born; it will happen.</p>
<p>Virtually every other option to drive them out and keep them out has been tried and failed miserably&hellip;</p>

		<p>Outrage?  What outrage?  All I see are some protected armchair liberals blowing hot air, alongside some noise-making and public vandalism committed by militants in a desperate grab for power and attention.  I thought local support for the law was at 85%, last I heard.  My bet is that if the law gets passed, crime will go significantly down, and I hope other states will follow suit.  I&rsquo;m really paying close attention to this.</p>

<p>Why should we have sympathy for these Illegals at the expense of our own laws and culture? We should have more states with Arizona-like immigration laws, now!.<br>

		<p>This IS all &#8220;hyperbolic rhetoric.&#8221; Clearly, none of these people engaging in the histrionics have read the bill. It closely mirrors existing federal law - which, it should be noted, is most certainly NOT being enforced at all. The government has a duty to protect its States from invasion. It has utterly abrogated that responsibility.</p>
<p>I say Congratulations!  I add that I hope my Governor Perry follows suit!</p>

		<p>This law is virtually guaranteed to cause a chain-reaction of other states duplicating it, as the criminal alien invaders will otherwise just move to other states and overload public-sector services there.  Even California will eventually have to bite the bullet and do this; the state is already bankrupt.  How can it possibly handle the inevitable influx of several million additional illegals?</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will be treated to the entertaining spectacle of huge marches of illegals waving Mexican flags who are simply unable to understand that this only increases public resentment of them and their cause.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;ll be struck down one way or another.  The purpose of mass immigration is racial genocide against white people and until people are forced to acknowledge that truth and support a pro or anti genocide position you&rsquo;re not going to make much headway on stopping it.  If you&rsquo;re afraid to even name a disease you&rsquo;re not likely to successfully treat it.   Mass immigration is a policy from the far left of reaching egalitarianism by exterminating the achievers (actually that&rsquo;s what it started out being,  now it&rsquo;s just pure irrational hatred of whites.  For the minority members of the leftist coalition it was always just pure racial hatred).     </p>

		<p>I think it is important to look at specifically WHO these &#8220;amnesty forces&#8221; are.</p>
<p>A quick peak at footage of the recent amnesty march on washington dc is very telling.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hfcYzgXYGw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hfcYzgXYGw</a></p>
<p>Not one white person.  Not one black person.  ONLY mexicans (and possibly some south americans).  In short, there are NO &#8220;amnesty forces&#8221;&hellip;.at least not among Americans.  The only large group of people who want amnesty are from outside this country.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time we gather up our courage and face the inevitable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we stop acting like there is nothing we can do about amnesty for invaders.  </p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve made a few traitors disappear the rest will fall in line.  </p>
<p>And once we&rsquo;ve made a few illegals disappear the rest will flee our country.   </p>

		<p>What infuriates me the most is the reaction of the msm, which has been has been blasting &#8216;hysteria&rsquo; for days on end over the new Arizona law.</p>
<p>Here in California, it&rsquo;s been non-stop, frenzied reporting from LaRaza Lulac and all other racist hispanic organizations whose goals are to &#8216;re-conquer&rsquo; the Southwest and drive out Whites, if not exterminate them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard ON THE NEWS Whites referred to as Bigots Racists and Haters as racist hispanics march around screaming about Nazi oppression.  I&rsquo;ve heard constant calls for a boycott of the entire state of Arizona and any/all products that come from Arizona, including Arizona Iced Tea which is bottled in New York.  I&rsquo;ve heard reports that the Arizona economy will implode as tourism, conventions, and businesses pull out because of this &#8216;racist law.&rsquo;  Aggrieved hispanics and their tearful children have been trotted out and interviewed endlessly to relate sob stories of &#8216;extreme&rsquo; hardship and families torn apart.</p>
<p>By continually repeating lies about &#8216;Americans&rsquo; being &#8216;thoroughly outraged&rsquo; and demanding that the &#8216;law be overturned immediately&rsquo;, they give the false impression that ALL Americans are united in their outrage at this &#8216;violation of Civil Rights&rsquo;, which is NOT TRUE as the polls are showing.</p>
<p>Nowhere have I see White Arizonans interviewed by the media to relate the destruction and damage done to their beautiful state from massive Third World immigration and the tremendous burden placed on the welfare system of the state  &mdash;  closed hospitals, increased drunk driving, increased crime rates, schools overwhelmed and forced to pay for bi-lingual and ESL programs, increased rates of illegitimacy and welfare use.  </p>
<p>And, of course, the irreparable damage done to the fragile desert environment as illegal colonists trample the terrain and throw tons of toxic garbage aside as they illegally enter the US.  The bought-off Sierra Club expresses no outrage.</p>
<p>Only on talk radio have I heard mention of Robert Krentz, the Arizona rancher killed by an illegal colonist.</p>
<p>And to poster #5, Fritz:</p>
