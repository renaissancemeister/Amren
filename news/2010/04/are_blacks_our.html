<h1><a href="/news/2008/01/are_blacks_our_1.html">Are Blacks Our Natural Allies in Immigration Control?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ellison Lodge, Special to AR News, January 3, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Los Angeles Times recently wrote about <a href="/news/2007/12/activist_fails.html" target="hayes" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Ted Hayes</b></a> and his attempt to rally African Americans against illegal immigration. Mr. Hayes started out as a homeless advocate in Los Angeles, but when he showed some interest in immigration control, immigration-reform activists eagerly adopted him. Minuteman groups that feared being called racists helped Mr. Hayes start the Crispus Attucks Minuteman Brigade, and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) set him up with something called Choose Black America.</p>
<p>As the Times pointed out, even Mr. Hayes himself admits his work has been a complete failure. Not only has he failed to attract blacks to his cause, he has lost the support of many left-wing white allies.</p>
<p>I once met Mr. Hayes at a Minuteman rally in Washington, D.C., in the summer of 2006  &mdash;  and was shocked by his appearance. He was in dreadlocks and a Rasta cap, and wore a chain with a large image of Africa attached to it. As it turned out, he nearly sank the rally single-handedly.</p>
<p>Like so many immigration-control gatherings, this one attracted the usual group of loud, unkempt, &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; activists. All the Minutemen wisely stayed away from them, knowing that any altercation would be blamed on them  &mdash;  that is to say, everyone but Mr. Hayes, who shoved a protester right in front of a news camera.</p>
<p>The only thing that prevented a PR disaster was Mr. Hayes&rsquo;s outlandish appearance. Television commentator Lou Dobbs, who is a strong campaigner for immigration control, got hold of the film and showed it on his program, thinking Mr. Hayes was an open-borders activist. You can hardly blame Mr. Dobbs; anyone would have thought this aggressive, wild-looking character was a lefty.</p>
<p>There may be a larger message in all this.</p>
<p>Opposition to mass immigration comes from across the political spectrum, and there are even some people on the left who are on our side. However, the base of the movement is white Americans who do not want a culturally alien underclass taking over their neighborhoods and schools.</p>
<p>Many such white people see blacks as a greater threat than Hispanics. With a few exceptions such as teenage pregnancy rates, on almost all indices of social failure, blacks are a bigger problem than Hispanics. Although they speak English, in some respects they are more culturally alien than Mexicans, and even the staunchest immigration-control activists have to admit that many Hispanics work hard. The current tidal wave of Hispanics is a dire threat to our way of life, but many whites see blacks as a bigger problem, especially in places that do not yet have large numbers of Hispanics.</p>
<p>That is why I think trying to join forces with the likes of Ted Hayes  &mdash;  who first came to prominence by setting up shanty towns for the homeless in the middle of Los Angeles  &mdash;  will alienate or at best confuse our natural following. It is a little like trying to work with the Bloods and Crips because they don&rsquo;t like MS-13 and the Latin Kings.</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes is not the only black who is opposed to illegal immigration, and not one has established a real following among other blacks. Nor have white activists. Both the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) and Numbers USA  &mdash;  the two biggest anti-immigration groups along with FAIR  &mdash;  have bent over backwards to promote blacks. Both have placed advertisements in major newspapers on the harm immigration has done to blacks, and CIS has sponsored congressional testimony and studies on the danger immigration poses to blacks.</p>
<p>None of this has attracted blacks to the cause, nor has it won any credit with the left. Shayla Nunnally, a black professor at the University of Connecticut, says black activists are being co-opted by groups &#8220;who may not have the African-American community&rsquo;s best interests in mind.&#8221; She says this leads to &#8220;minorities fighting minorities,&#8221; while &#8220;fighting the overall oppression isn&rsquo;t being addressed.&#8221; Like so many liberals, she thinks all non-whites must unite against the real oppressor: the white man.</p>
<p>This is the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s line. It says black activists like Mr. Hayes are just &#8220;pawns in [the racists&rsquo;] game.&#8221; It recently listed FAIR as a hate group.</p>
<p>In fact, blacks have every reason to be more opposed even than whites to illegal immigration. They compete directly with low-wage immigrants for welfare, jobs, and classroom space, and they are not the ones who save a buck by hiring Mexican day labor at $7.00 an hour. At the same time, blacks have no qualms about explicitly pushing their racial interests. They oppose anything they think is bad for blacks, and Mexican immigration is bad for them.</p>
<p>However, nothing indicates blacks will contribute much to the anti-immigration movement, much less lead it. Blacks outpoll whites in support for school vouchers and in opposition to gay marriage and abortion, but this does not translate into a useful role in any of those movements either.</p>
<p>Immigration-control advocates never seem to get over the delusion that blacks will eventually rally to the cause. This is why Tom Tancredo was the only Republican presidential candidate to speak to the NAACP. Blacks should be carrying Mr. Tancredo around on their shoulders, but they pay him no attention at all. The congressman&rsquo;s support came almost exclusively from whites.</p>
<p>Smart conservatives learned long ago that blacks have essentially no political role outside of the narrow band of issues the liberal establishment sets aside for them. Blacks have always blindly followed &#8220;leaders&#8221; who are aligned with the left wing of the Democratic Party. Those leaders also have an interest in increasing Hispanic political power in order to entrench their anti-white policies. Many have spent their entire careers blaming whites for anything and everything. This either blinds them to threats from anyone else, or makes them incapable of seeking white allies even if they see the threat. There are no black congressmen in the Immigration Reform Caucus. Don&rsquo;t expect one any time soon.</p>
<p>It would be logical  &mdash;  it would even be helpful  &mdash;  if ordinary blacks would turn on the demagogues, and do something in their own interests that was actually in ours as well. Don&rsquo;t count on it. Massive outreach by Republicans and conservatives has had little success on any front, has long since passed the point of diminishing returns.</p>

What these same racist blacks don&rsquo;t realize is that the hispanics are killing them and taking over their neighborhoods.  Personally, I prefer hispanics over blacks.  They have white blood in them, have better family values than blacks, and don&rsquo;t hate us like blacks do.</p>

		<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t interested in enforcing immigration laws for one and only one reason  &mdash;  there is too much welfare. If government aid was taken away and hundreds of thousands of people needed to get a job, their whole tune on immigration would change. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks have every reason to be opposed to illegal immigration &mdash; but they aren&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course not, because blacks care nothing about the country as a whole.  They care only about their own tribe and they see immigrants, not as competitors, but as an influx that is weakening the white power structure, which they totally despise, heart and soul. </p>
<p>And anything that hurts whitey is A-o.k. with them.</p>

<p>I think this is true. Much like gay marraige, ordinary blacks are generally opposed to hispanic immigration, and resent hispanics for taking positions that they think should go to them.  This is only getting worse, because hispanics have surpassed blacks in income in many places, and often dislike blacks as well.  Other races often make white &#8220;racists&#8221; look like like amateurs.  </p>
<p>In my exprience, blacks are race realists; they&rsquo;re very rarely sympathetic or charitable toward other races.  I haven&rsquo;t seen any poll information; but I would bet that blacks tend to oppose illegal immigration in greater numbers than do whites.  Albeit, they will never cooperate with whites on anything that doesn&rsquo;t directly apply to them, so forget any sort of alliance.</p>

		<p>As alluded to by a poster # 1, the lower average IQ of blacks keeps them from being interested in political issues, aside from what their &#8220;leaders&#8221; (mostly whites) tell them they should be interested in. </p>
<p>Blacks tend to have a narrower range of interests than whites anyway. There are certain sports, like basketball, that they dominate, but others, such as winter sports, that they are almost entirely uninterested in. </p>
<p>They tend to lack interest in the sciences, literature (outside of black literature), most types of music, such as classical, history (outside of their own Black history) etc. The interests of blacks are very parochial and one-dimensional which, aside from the IQ issue, is the reason they have made few if any notable achievements in most fields. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it is, and the way it likely always will be. Why should the political arena be any different?</p>

		<p>I can only relate my experiences with Blacks (lower-middle income) during the 1970&rsquo;s and early 1980&rsquo;s on immigration: They, male and female, were opposed to it. Unlike the Whites in similar demographic categories, they realized that immigrants were taking up space and jobs that belonged to Americans, and the Blacks considered themselves to be Americans. The Blacks never spouted off nonsense like, &#8220;We are a nation of immigrants&#8221;, or &#8220;Immigrants enrich us all&#8221;. The problem was that they passively accepted the situation, and had no desire to organize against it. Although, if the opportunity came up, they would do nasty things to individual aliens. </p>
<p>This seems to be typical African behavior:  deal with the present, ignore the future. Granted, this is more than most Whites have done when combating massive immigration.</p>

		<p>I have a different theory.  I believe that blacks see the non-white immigration invasion as competition for the eroding white tribe to which blacks are fusing.  In a sense, they have a vested interest in securing as much of the white racial stock as they can for the new mulatto types that will evolve from the admixture.  I think its rooted in their subconscious but this is the reasoning behind their stance.</p>

		<p>#5 is correct.  As with many other issues, one cannot listen solely to what airbag activists proclaim about an issue.  Ghetto blacks are upset about people who are invading their neighborhoods, taking jobs, edging them out of the drug trade, killing their members, and taking a big piece of the welfare pie.  Hard-working blacks are upset for the same reasons as any other American.</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t care that illegal immigrants are &#8220;taking their jobs&#8221;.  They didn&rsquo;t want them in the first place.  They don&rsquo;t want to work at all, but want to expand the welfare state.<br>
The only time you see discontent and outright violence between blacks and hispanics is when the illegals try to muscle in on drug and gang territory.  Which is happening a lot.  But you have NEVER seen BLACKS hanging out on corners and in parking lots seeking day labor work, have you?  Nope.  If they are hanging on corners at all, it&rsquo;s because they are selling drugs or merely establishing their gang territory.  We should stop the silly notion that one of the groups is more acceptable than the other, or that one could be an ally against the other.  BOTH are dangerous, both don&rsquo;t care a bit about this country, both hate whites, both only care about what they can rip off from the white man, and both dream of the day when they are the majority and can do to us what they are doing in South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p>

I never said that I wanted either in America or in any historically white country.  Just saying if I had to chose which non-white group, it would be the hispanics.  Yes, I do speak from experience.  I&rsquo;ve been around lots of Hispanics and felt more comfortable around them than a big group of blacks.  But, as a later poster pointed out, both don&rsquo;t like us and want our goods. Is just that I have noticed more of the hate of and dependence on whites from blacks.  That&rsquo;s all.</p>

		<p>This is the crux of the issue (as to why blacks aren&rsquo;t interested in stopping hispanic colonization, which is mostly taking place in BLACK neighborhoods here in California):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Shayla Nunnally, a black professor at the University of Connecticut, says black activists are being co-opted by groups &#8216;who may not have the African-American community&rsquo;s best interests in mind.&rsquo;.. Like so many liberals, she thinks all non-whites must unite against the real oppressor: The White Man&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, so while blacks are being violently driven from their neighborhoods by hispanics,  black schools becoming hispanic-centric with large amounts of educational dollars going to to bi-lingual and ESL programs, black populations finding themselves overwhelmed by high numbers of hispanics forming an ethno-centric voting bloc, blacks are still concerned with seeking out THE REAL OPPRESSOR:  The Great White Bigot.</p>
<p>Black politicians have sold out their own people, telling them their greatest threat is The White Man and not unfettered illegal immigration from black-hating hispanics. </p>
<p>Here again are the immigration &#8216;grades&rsquo; for black politicians in California from NumbersUSA:</p>
<p>Maxine Waters:  D- <br>
Diane Watson:  F<br>
Barbara Lee:  F-</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/33m4pof" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/33m4pof</a></p>
<p>These &#8216;groups&rsquo; the &#8216;professor&rsquo; speaks of that &#8216;do not have the African-American community&rsquo;s best interests in mind are not composed of Whites; they are ethno-centric hispanics and Asians, groups that have no use for violent blacks and don&rsquo;t want them around their colonies, i.e., the entire state.  </p>

		<p>To 10  &mdash;  Awakened:</p>
<p>I have to concur with white is right, black is whack.  If I had to choose between the two groups, I would sooner choose latinos over blacks.</p>
<p>I have lived my whole life in Zoo York City and I can tell you unequivocally: blacks absolutely HATE White people!  They will twist whatever facts they can to rationalize that hatred.  They may lie to you about it, but be around them long enough (as I have) and eventually the mask falls off, so to speak.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdJB-qkfUHc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdJB-qkfUHc</a></p>
<p>While many latinos (especially Mexicans) dislike Whites, most of them (from my experience, anyway) are indifferent to us.  It&rsquo;s also worth noting many if not most other latinos, especially Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, do NOT like Mexicans!  The feeling is mutual, from what I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>https://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/09/02/2009-09-02_series_of_bias_crimes_in_bx.html?print=1&page;=all</p>
<p>People, it&rsquo;s not &#8220;one big happy family&#8221; among latinos.  While they may intermarry from time to time, they tend to group along national loyalties.</p>
<p>Another big difference between blacks and latinos: while many black men have a hankering for White women, few black women like White men, even though there aren&rsquo;t enough black men to go around for them.  Of course, given the fact the clear majority of White males have zero interest in black women and with everything we know about the dangers of miscegenation, no big loss.</p>
<p>With latinos, however, things change.  Any visit to a large American city with substantial numbers of Whites and latinos living in it will show that large numbers of both male and female latinos like to date/marry Whites.  I have seen far too much of this phenomenon to believe otherwise.  In most cases I have witnessed, the family seems to approve.  The more &#8220;Americanized&#8221; the family, the greater likelihood the approval.</p>
<p>With either group, however, in the end it works against Whites.  With blacks, the moment they become the overdog they will work to exterminate us (like they did in Zimbabwe).  With latinos, they will simply breed us out of existence, as they have done or are doing in every Latin American country.  Either scenario spells the extinction of the White race and must be opposed!<br>

		<p>It takes a bit of intelligence to be against illegal immigration. Along with the knowledge Blacks are the first to be negatively impacted by illegal immigration. On the other hand, illegal immigrants taking jobs from Blacks is a made-to-order excuse to collect welfare checks.</p>

		<p>The politically active black leaders might be for the illegal immigrant. The money they recieve from the power brokers demand it. But&hellip; the ordinary Black (unlike the ordinary white) has a penchent for surviving as a race. The average Black is all for throwing out the illegal alien. I have talked to dozens about it and I have not found one that wants illegal immigration.Blacks know how to stick together for their own good. I admire that uality about them. </p>

		<p>Blacks do want the hispanics to join them in their holy war against their greatest enenigo, namely Whitey, as many posters here have said. What will happen, in the near future as more and more hispanics come here and live near blacks, blacks will see that hispanics will not join them in their war against and hatred of Whitey, and start to oppose illegal immigration. This trend is already underway.</p>

		<p> Bon, from The Land of Babble:There is one black representative that is worse than all of the ones that you listed put together. She is from Texas,her name is Shelia Jackson,and she wants completely open borders, and she even wrote legislatoon that would make it illegal to NOT hire an illegal alien that applied for a job!  </p>

		<p>17 Anon: There are not enough &#8220;educated&#8221; Mexican men for the all the &#8220;educated&#8221; Mexican women, so many of them either marry down or marry White.  Of course, the White man who marries a Mexican is marrying down as a rule, but they tend to be downwardly mobile guys anyway.  And they generally come to regret the in-laws they&rsquo;ve chosen.  It&rsquo;s a rare Mexican woman who has no cousins in jail.  </p>

		<p>I think most people miss the point.</p>
<p>Blacks simply lack the ability to act cohesively in a self-directed manner.  Before various groups started to manipulate them for political gain, they, essentially, had no political presence in this country.  Almost zero interest in voting.</p>
<p>So, it does not matter what is in their best interest, no matter how strong the interest or unanimous the position on an issue.  Blacks will support, as a bloc, whomever they are told to support.  That is the bottom line.</p>
<p>If whites want their support on this issue, they will need to co-opt the system by which blacks are manipulated and told what to do.  Convincing them about the issue itself is completely irrelevant&hellip;..not just in this country, btw.</p>
<p>Witness zimbabwe, where the average black person is suffering horribly under Mugabe and desperately wishes a return to white rule and prosperity.  Although the majority, this opinion has no voice. Why?</p>
<p>This is probably the biggest scam with regard to race relations.  To tell well meaning whites that blacks have unrepresented desires and needs but due to &#8220;racism&#8221;, these have been ignored.  So, well meaning whites work to give representation to these things&hellip;..only to have a third party with malevolent intent towards both whites AND blacks, co-opt the agenda of an ignorant and mostly apathetic black voting bloc.</p>
<p>If Al Sharpton started working tomorrow to re-institute black slavery in the US, this message would go largely unnoticed (yet fully supported) by most American blacks.</p>
