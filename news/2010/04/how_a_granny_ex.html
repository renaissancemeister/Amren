			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Chapman, Daily Mail (London), April 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gordon Brown was fighting for his political life today after he delivered a potential knockout blow to his own election hopes just hours before the crucial final live television debate.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will desperately try and draw a line under the &#8216;bigotgate&rsquo; scandal when he is expected to apologise again for insulting grandmother Gillian Duffy in tonight&rsquo;s debate.</p>
<p>In a tumultuous day for Labour, the Prime Minister tore up his plans and returned to Mrs Duffy&rsquo;s terrace house to beg for forgiveness after he was caught calling her a bigot because she questioned him about immigration.</p>
<p>He also sent a grovelling email to Labour supporters apologising for hurting the party&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>&#8216;You know I have strengths as well as weaknesses. We all do. You also know that sometimes we say and do things we regret. I profoundly regret what I said this morning,&rsquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>A TV microphone overheard Mr Brown privately attacking Mrs Duffy, 66, as a &#8216;bigot&rsquo; for daring to raise immigration with him  &mdash;  seconds after telling her she was a &#8216;good woman&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;That was a disaster. You should never have put me with that woman. Whose idea was that?</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s Sue [Nye, a Brown election aide] I think. It&rsquo;s just ridiculous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Asked what Mrs Duffy had said, he replies: &#8216;Oh, everything .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She&rsquo;s just a sort of bigoted woman that said she used to be Labour.</p>
<p>&#8216;I mean it&rsquo;s just ridiculous. I don&rsquo;t know why Sue brought her up towards me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It came on the day that Labour&rsquo;s favourite think-tank admitted those concerned about mass immigration had been treated as &#8216;nasty, stupid and backward.</p>
<p>Polls suggest the issue is second only to the economy among people&rsquo;s concerns at the election, though none of the three main parties has been keen to discuss it.</p>
<p>Despite the extraordinary 40-minute visit by Mr Brown to Mrs Duffy&rsquo;s home, her niece, also called Gillian, said: &#8216;She&rsquo;s a very strong-willed person and I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll accept the apology.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But his gaffe prompted anger among colleagues, who feared he had given voters a devastating insight into his own character and undermined the party&rsquo;s stance on a key issue.</p>
<p>Mr Brown held his head in his hands as a recording of his off-guard remarks, made to an aide in the back of his limousine, was played back to him soon afterwards.</p>
<p>A shocked Mrs Duffy, a widow who spent her career working with handicapped children, said she had been a lifelong Labour supporter but would not now vote for Mr Brown.</p>
<p>Lord Mandelson led a desperate damage limitation exercise, pleading that the Prime Minister was &#8216;slightly tired&rsquo; and &#8216;letting off steam&rsquo; but admitting there could be &#8216;no justification&rsquo; for his remarks.</p>
<p>Spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who was last night helping Mr Brown prepare for tonight&rsquo;s make-or-break leaders&rsquo; TV debate, admitted: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen him so angry with himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The disaster  &mdash;  dubbed &#8216;Bigotgate&rsquo; in Westminster  &mdash;  unfolded as Mr Brown visited a community payback scheme in Rochdale.</p>
<p>Mrs Duffy was introduced to him by an aide and the pair embarked on an apparently good-natured discussion in which she raised the national debt, student loans, tax and benefits.</p>
<p>She briefly mentioned immigration, telling Mr Brown: &#8216;You can&rsquo;t say anything about immigrants. All these Eastern Europeans, where are they flocking from?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two appeared to part amicably, with Mrs Duffy saying she intended to vote Labour as Mr Brown retreated to his car.</p>
<p>But unaware his microphone was still on, he then angrily turned to aide Justin Forsyth and said: &#8216;That was a disaster .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should never have put me with that woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Asked what she had said, he replied: &#8216;Oh, everything. She was just a sort of bigoted woman who said she used to be Labour. I mean, it&rsquo;s just ridiculous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Duffy, told soon afterwards about Mr Brown&rsquo;s remarks, was visibly upset.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m disgusted,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;He&rsquo;s an educated person, why has he come out with words like that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Forced to listen to his own remarks in a BBC interview, Mr Brown appeared close to breaking point and his voice shook as he apologised.</p>
<p>But that was deemed inadequate by horrified colleagues and he went back to Mrs Duffy&rsquo;s house to say sorry in person, emerging after 40 minutes to describe himself as a &#8216;penitent sinner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But Sir Andrew Green, head of the MigrationWatch think tank, said: &#8216;Finally the mask has slipped. As soon as a real voter raises the question of immigration with the Prime Minister, she&rsquo;s insulted as a bigot.</p>
<p>&#8216;How could a Government under Gordon Brown be trusted to make a serious effort to tackle mass immigration when his true views have now been exposed to the public?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s wife, Sarah Brown, spent much of yesterday campaigning in his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency in Fife.</p>
<p>Mrs Brown first visited Adam Smith College in Glenrothes where she chatted to art and design students and then spent time with elderly visitors to Abbeyview Day Centre in Dunfermline.</p>
<p>And as her campaign efforts continued, she was out and about in Cowdenbeath.</p>
<p>On her Twitter page yesterday, she said she had &#8216;been campaigning in Edinburgh and Fife last night and today  &mdash;  good to see so many friends.&rsquo;<br>

<p><i>She briefly mentioned immigration, telling Mr Brown: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t say anything about immigrants. All these Eastern Europeans, where are they flocking from?&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><br>
From Eastern Europe would be my guess. </p>
<p>But seriously, she&rsquo;s just lucky she&rsquo;s not in an area with nonwhite immigration. And Gordon Brown is lucky on that score too   &mdash;   because as embarrassing and as vote-losing as this incident is for him and NuLabour, if an English person had made a similar remark about black or Muslim immigrants, this &#8220;Bigotgate&#8221; scandal would&rsquo;ve been 10 times worse for him. </p>
<p>And 10 times more delicious for us. </p>
<p>Even so, I&rsquo;m very glad it happened. Just one more nail in NuLabour&rsquo;s coffin&hellip; and a bunch more votes for the BNP. </p>

<p>Not quite true.  He &#8220;profoundly regrets&#8221; getting caught being his bigotted, radical leftist self.</p>
<p>And of course bering a bigot to the Labour immigration advocates applies to anyone refusing to believe labour&rsquo;s perverted reasons for inundating the country with people who despise Britons and want to take over the country and install sharia law.</p>
<p>Like the US leftist dregs, these people are just plain stupid.  I&rsquo;m sorry, but nothing else describes them any better.</p>

<p>Clearly, this gaffe demonstrates Gordon Brown&rsquo;s seething contempt for ordinary British people and their concerns.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&rsquo;s not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren&rsquo;t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was still elected.  The media still had months to propagandize for him so that his contempt for average Americans was forgotten.<br>

		<p>Honestly, this lady thinks that Eastern Europeans are the problem? Is that what Brits think? Granted, an influx of Eastern Europeans might lend just as deathly of a blow to native Britons as non-White immigrants, but it&rsquo;s a question of the lesser of two evils. One has a strong propensity for assimilation. The other has no chance at it. </p>
<p>Her comment magnifies the very tangled knot at the heart of British politics. </p>

Take note men and women of England, this is what your ruling &#8216;elites&rsquo; think of you if you dare to deviate even in this mild manner from what you have been told to believe is good for England and good for you.<br>
Do not vote labor or conservative.</p>

		<p>  wow!!!  labour is the democrat party here. If you speak out against illegal immigration in the states, you are branded a racist. I have to deal with non-whites everyday, it is ugly. I deal with illegals often, it is very ugly. The U.S. just like Europe, has a real and dangerous problem, we are about to lose our countries because of it.</p>

		<p>  Deep down the privileged elites of both formerly Great Britain and the United States feel contempt for white working and middle class people. Occasionally, as in the case of Gordon Brown, they can&rsquo;t contain their arrogant hatred. What is truly amazing is the huge number of disenfranchised whites who continue to vote for pro-immigration Labour or the amnesty-loving Liberal Democrats.  Only the BNP represents the rights of working class indigenous people.</p>

		<p>The first rule to be obeyed by any politician (or any other marketing-man) is &#8220;know thy public&#8221;.<br>
 If Gordon Brown had actually deigned to get out of his ivory tower and go &#8216;on the knocker&rsquo; (ie canvassing voters by knocking on hundreds of front doors around the country and chatting to the householders), he would realise that up-and-down Britain there are literally miilions of women who look like Mrs Duffy and think and talk like Mrs Duffy.</p>

		<p>What I notice about this whole thing is that the media is in an uproar over this&hellip;.but I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s only because the woman was talking about Eastern European immigration.  If she was talking about non-White immigration, the media would have spun this story differently.  I&rsquo;ve noticed lately that it seems to be &#8220;ok&#8221; in the leftwing media&rsquo;s mind to express concern about Eastern European immigration into England, but non-White immigration seems to be &#8220;not ok&#8221;.  Hypocrites.  </p>

		<p>This is just too sweet!  Brown&rsquo;s contemptible comments into a live mike perfectly illustrate the colossal contempt the left has for any dissent from their infantile views. Not that it will diminish him in the minds of his supporters, who agree wholeheartedly with his sentiments.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t bet that he&rsquo;s finished politically.  Teddy Kennedy, the arch-buffoon of the American left, managed to survive far worse. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that &#8220;Eastern Europeans&#8221; can also be a code for one of the words we&rsquo;re not supposed to say any more - &#8220;Gypsies&#8221;.  The preferred term is now &#8220;Roma&#8221;, but under whatever name, it&rsquo;s apparently racist to complain if you find them living in your garden, your garden shed, your house, or the local park. </p>

		<p>If only it was just Gordon Brown who thought like this.  He was the one who got caught out, forgetting that he was still &#8220;miked up&#8221; (what a muppet!), but this represents the mind-set of Britain&rsquo;s entire political/cultural elite, including the leading members of all our political parties apart from the BNP and maybe UKIP.  If you&rsquo;re worried about immigration, then as far as they&rsquo;re concerned you&rsquo;re a racist bigot.  End of story.<br>
Sadly, I don&rsquo;t expect this incident to significantly enhance the BNP vote in next week&rsquo;s election. Most white Britons are too brainwashed to do anything that might possibly be conceived as racist, even in the privacy of the polling booth.</p>

		<p>Actually this woman DID mention non-european immigrants.It was Brown and the compliant media that airbrushed them out of the picture.This occurs on a regular basis on television.</p>
<p>For the benefit of the earlier poster who said she was lucky to live in an area with no non-white immigration nothing could be further from the truth.Nowhere in Greater Manchester/Lancashire is beyond the Islamic crescent. </p>

		<p> As for non-gypsy workers in (and immigrants to) England from Eastern Europe, I have seen them at work in numerous hotels, restaurants, travel agencies, subway kiosks etc.; we in the US should be lucky to have such a &#8216;problem&rsquo;. These are White Christian people with genuine European values, and in Western Europe&rsquo;s present sorry degenerate state they can only enrich and robustify England, France etc. I agree with those posters here who state that had this voter mentioned, instead, the non-White immigrants (esp. the hostile, colonizing Muslim hordes), the British media would have likely been caught sharing Brown&rsquo;s arrogant disdain for true England and her people. And this would indeed have been even better for the cause of true Conservatism (as opposed the feckless Tories) in the British Isles. </p>
