			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Seamark, Daily Mail (London), April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One is a soldier who suffered 37 separate injuries in a landmine blast and was offered a paltry £152,000. </p>
<p>The other is a woman who won a controversial sex discrimination claim over Army childcare and now wants an extraordinary £1.14million in compensation. </p>
<p>Last night there was a storm of protest over the iniquity of the very different handling of their two cases. The amount being demanded by Tilern DeBique is seven times that originally offered to severely-wounded paratrooper Ben Parkinson. </p>
<p>He lost both his legs and suffered severe brain injuries. </p>
<p>The full extent of Miss DeBique&rsquo;s claim emerged at an employment tribunal  &mdash;  after the single mother successfully argued she was forced to choose between a military career and caring for her four-year-old daughter. </p>
<p>The £1,142,257 total includes £473,535 for loss of earnings, £325,160 for loss of Army benefits, £315,562 for loss of pension rights, £18,000 for &#8216;hurt feelings&rsquo; and £10,000 in aggravated damages. </p>
<p>Mr Parkinson&rsquo;s mother, Diane Dernie, said: &#8216;I was forced out of my job to look after my child and I got nothing.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Her son was initially offered £152,000 but was eventually awarded £570,000 compensation  &mdash;  but only after the Goverment caved in to public outrage. </p>
<p>Mrs Dernie added: &#8216;I can&rsquo;t see how Ben and all these other boys&rsquo; lives are worth so much less. These soldiers have done their duty, they have done their job but their careers are over. This woman can get another job but for Ben, that&rsquo;s it  &mdash;  for life.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Lord Guthrie, former Chief of Defence Staff, described Miss DeBique&rsquo;s compensation claim as a &#8216;crazy and highly unrealistic amount of money&rsquo;. He added: &#8216;I think in comparison with soldiers who put their lives on the line, their widows and those who are wounded, it&rsquo;s indecent.&rsquo; </p>
<p>General Sir Mike Jackson, former Chief of the General Staff and head of the Army during the Iraq invasion, called the amount &#8216;an extraordinary figure&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Miss DeBique, 28, who calls herself SexyT on her MySpace webpage, admits turning down a UK posting with childcare facilities and applying for civilian jobs in Afghanistan before leaving the Army. </p>
<p>She quit her job as a technician in the 10th Signal Regiment in April 2008 after being disciplined for failing to appear on parade because of childcare difficulties for her daughter Tahlia, now four. </p>
<p>Besides winning her landmark sex discrimination case Miss DeBique also won a claim for race discrimination because Army chiefs did not let her bring her half-sister from the Caribbean  &mdash;  where she was recruited  &mdash;  to look after her child. </p>
<p>Her victory left senior officers facing the nightmare task of having to consider soldiers&rsquo; childcare problems before giving them orders. </p>
<p>She is claiming over £;1.14million because she argues that she would have stayed in the Army until 2023, instead of being forced to quit her £30,341-a-year job after seven years of service. </p>
<p>The MoD&rsquo;s barrister Keith Morton branded her compensation claim &rsquo; perverse&rsquo; and said it was &#8216;unreasonable&rsquo; for Miss DeBique to have turned down a posting that offered childcare while applying for lucrative civilian jobs in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>She was offered a &#8216;unique&rsquo; five-year non-deployable posting to Blandford Army garrison in Dorset, which had childcare facilities, in 2007. </p>
<p>Miss DeBique says she felt unable to accept the posting because she only had four days to make a decision and because of the Army&rsquo;s previous failure to address her childcare needs and instead, handed in her year&rsquo;s notice in April 2007. </p>
<p>Miss Debique, who lives in Tooting, South West London, quit when she was disciplined for failing to be available for duty around the clock. Her commanding officer told her the Army was &#8216;unsuitable for a single mother who couldn&rsquo;t sort out her childcare arrangements&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The Central London Employment Tribunal panel is due to announce its compensation award tomorrow. <br/>

		<p>This case is beyond dumb. It&rsquo;s surreal.  </p>
<p>The insanity of the lawsuit lottery with blacks will continue unabated in England and here in the U.S.A, as well. There&rsquo;s not a soul in office in both countries that will step up and bring an end to this nation-killing game.  </p>

		<p>I find it hard to believe that this woman had even the slightest value as a soldier.  To even refer to her as &#8220;soldier&#8221; seems laughable (look at her picture in the article).  Is this what has become of the british army?</p>
<p>But Britain is almost certainly not alone in turning the military into a jobs program for spoiled single mothers with diva complexes.  Is America far behind.  We are just not serious nations anymore.  We are unserious nations full of unserious people.  I&rsquo;m sure the Chinese are paying attention.</p>

		<p>Simply outrageous, but one point is missed in the subtitle for this article (&#8220;British army pays dearly for enlisting black Caribbean woman.&#8221;) The British army risks this kind of situation in ANY deployment of fertile women of ANY race. Closer to home, it&rsquo;s well known that the US military is one big babysitting service for single moms, don&rsquo;tcha know?<br/>

		<p>The British Army has a very long and honorable fighting tradition stretching back for centuries.<br/>
When one thinks of the British fighting man, who fought and died in their thousands in places far away from home, not a single one of them resembled Miss DeBique in the slightest possible way.<br/>
 Even thirty years ago it would be totally unthinkable that someone like Miss DeBique would ever be considered to be a British soldier.</p>

		<p>One unanswered question is did this womn get permission to have a baby?  I think not.  As an ex-servicem, we had to even get permision to grow a beard and then it was only allowed if we had a rash when we shaved; permission to get married etc.  Should she have been discharged when she fell pregnant in these days of preventable pregnancies.  Britain really is in a mess with such actions that this woman is taking.  In my yunger days she would have been referred to as s &#8220;slut&#8221; by having a child out of wedlock.  No mention is made of the father.</p>

		<p>A lot of people, both men and women, have turned down jobs because of their children, say a man with small kids who doesn&rsquo;t want to be traveling on the road all the time. If this woman can&rsquo;t sort out her childcare, then she needs to find a job that suits her situation, just like everyone else.</p>

		<p>Normally, I would say Miss <i>Thang</i> is in the running for the next ghetto lottery. But it looks like public outrage is going to work against her this time. </p>
<p>Also, I would suggest that rather than bringing her half-sister from the caribbean to look after her children that she and her children move to the caribbean for her half sister to look after them. Or was Miss <i>Thang</i> just trying to get some more relatives on the dole?</p>

		<p>Latest news is she was awarded (scammed) only just over Pds. Sterling 17 000 or about $25 000. She has lost her job and will find it very difficult to get another when the new employer knows that shge is a &#8220;discrimination claimer&#8221; and obviously this will be noted on her discharge papers.  When I was in the services RAF, I knew from the first day that the military &#8220;owned my body&#8221; 24/7 but I received privileges and benefits in return including a three year course from the age of 17 that was second to none anywhere.  One of my friends on the course when he finished joined his parents in the USA being released for the RAF on the condition he joined the USAF.  After basic training he was given the rank of top-sergeant because of his skills and knowledge as an armourer.</p>
<p>But the Americans have the right attitude to vets.  I love it and when my wife and I holidayed in New York two years ago I appreciated the looks when I asked for a vet&rsquo;s discount for tickets to the various tourist places; and my wife qualified as well. Mind you I do have a thick mop of white hair now.   Lovely country, America.</p>

When I think of the British Army the first images that come into my mind are of the brave red coats (and the like), who fought and died all over the globe in situations and places as diverse as the Americas, the African continent, the Napoleonic Wars and the three Anglo-Afghan Wars.<br/>

I can&rsquo;t get over the fact that this &ldquo;SexyT&rdquo; declined the choice of being stationed at a UK base with childcare facilities? And still managed to get a big payout?</p>
<p>This is surely a decision that will do more damage to the fighting men&rsquo;s morale, than anything the enemy can throw at them.<br/>
Sickening.<br/>
I once naively posted on this very forum that I thought that &#8220;History ought to be won be the winners&#8221;(assuming that was us!), upon (prompted) reflection I now realise that although we Allies technically won all the big conventional, pivotal wars, that we have lost those other more subtle and covert wars waged in the schools and the airways for the hearts and minds of our people. <br/>
This is another decisive blow struck from within our very own lines!<br/>
