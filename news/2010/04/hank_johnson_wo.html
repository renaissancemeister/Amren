	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a discussion regarding a planned military buildup on the Pacific island, Johnson expressed some concerns about the plans to Adm. Robert Willard, head of the U.S. Pacific fleet.</p>
<p>&#8220;My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize,&#8221; Johnson said. Willard paused and replied, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t anticipate that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online pundits have wasted no time lampooning the congressman for his remarks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Hill, a spokesman for Johnson responded to the incident by saying the congressman is concerned the influx of military personnel will overwhelm the island&rsquo;s infrastructure and ecosystem.</p>

<p>Funny how this island (simply thriving on nonwhite &ldquo;ingenuity,&rdquo; mind you) is feared to possibly being able to be &ldquo;capsized&rdquo; by a mere military build up there, but: the USA, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia, are all seen as being able to withstand and absorb, an endless diversity tsunami of &ldquo;migrants&rdquo; and &ldquo;refugees.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Odd, how white developed regions are always &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; and never &ldquo;overwhelmed&rdquo; by such strains on, &ldquo;infrastructure and ecosystems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I watched the video to see if this character might have been trying to make a joke of the entire matter and concluded it was very plain that he was dead serious.</p>
<p>This kind of an illogical assertion isn&rsquo;t unusual with blacks, <br>
however. Congressman John Lewis claims tea partiers slurred him with the &#8220;n&#8221; word 15 TIMES when hurling the insult even once would have been picked up by the press, the police, the other politicians and the protestors themselves, yet not one other person will verify such a happening, nor does any of the video evidence support the charge.</p>
<p>Lewis also stated on the floor of the house a few years ago that the US slave ships from Africa threw &#8220;millions&#8221; of blacks overboard, causing the shark migration pattern to permanently change.  It was quite ridiculous, since it&rsquo;s pure stupidity to conclude that the ship&rsquo;s owners would allow that to happen, if for no reason other than it would be the same as throwing money away.</p>
<p>The character in this story and the John Lewis types have a commonality of making ludicrous assertions that not only have no basis in fact, but they&rsquo;re so bizarre as to be regarded as intentional attempts at comedy. </p>
<p>The main thing all incidents like these illustrate is that blacks bring down the level of discourse and debate to childish levels and offer further proof that blacks cannot compete on an intellectual level in a first world civilization.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re expected to believe that it is racism and oppression that holds them back from succeeding.</p>

		<p>I listened to the attached video and was amused, but not surprised.</p>
<p>If the congressman was not drunk or on drugs, he is at the very least (and using Christian charity) intellectually/mathematically challenged, being a bit confused on the words, length and wide and the inability to multiply the width x the length to get the approximate square miles. (Something, which White 8 year olds know.)</p>
<p>I have to hope the Admiral knew all these answers and just didn&rsquo;t want to make the congressman look like even a bigger dolt-the congressman after all holds the purse strings.</p>
<p>&hellip;or perhaps I am missing something&hellip;was this actually the congressman and not a Capitol Hill porter or janitor masquerading, due to the congressman being &ldquo;incapacitated&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then again, who would know the difference?<br>

		<p>I watched the video of this exchange after an acquaintance of mine posted it to his Facebook page.  I listened to Rep. Johnson, and if you listen to him speak, he sounds mildly mentally retarded.  I am not using that term as a vulgar insult.  I believe he is truly mentally retarded.  He struggles to formulates his thoughts, and he speaks haltingly as a result.  I wonder if there are any mental health professionals who are Amren readers.  I know some, and I know that they can spot mildly mentally retarded people accurately and quickly.  </p>

They have no natural enemies and are devouring all the birds and wildlife on the island, pets, they&rsquo;re climbing telephone wires and dropping into peoples homes, cribs, beds!&hellip;  A nightmare.

		<p>I watched the video and it doesn&rsquo;t look like he was joking. I lived in Manhattan for many years and it sounds like Manhattan is around the same size as Guam, maybe a little larger. Well, if Manhattan hasn&rsquo;t capsized by now, Guam sure won&rsquo;t. Anyway, does he think islands float? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll give Congressman Johnson the benefit of the doubt and say it was a poor attempt at humor.  But even if he were dead serious, Hank Johnson would be no more inept than the people responsible for implementing a buildup on Guam.  Do we really need to beef up the military on a 209-square-mile volcanic rock in the middle of the Pacific?  Like the Soviet Union before us (another bankrupt multicultural state), our days as a superpower are numbered. </p>

<p>He does have Hep C but I&rsquo;m not sure that is the reason.</p>

		<p>Estimates put the number of Americans with Hepatitis C at well over 4 million - and that could be low. It is treatable and many patients do well. </p>
<p>I saw the video of Hank Johnson - either he is just very stupid or was under the influence of some drug/substance that made him very stupid. </p>
<p>The Hepatitis C is a cover story (Johnson even said he has been clear of the virus since about 2000) - apparently concocted by idiots. It&rsquo;s almost like saying Mr. Johnson made the dumb remark because he had a sprained ankle.</p>
<p>Either way, be it because he is simply stupid - or was on drugs - this person is not qualified to be in any position of authority. It is really a sad day for this country when this dimwit is in Congress. </p>
<p>According to his bio he did graduate from a &#8220;Historically Black College&#8221; in Atlanta and later from the Thurgood Marshall School of Law in Houston. So you can see where his intellectual depth comes from, at least in part. </p>
<p>And no - he wasn&rsquo;t making a joke. First, watch the video. Second, it&rsquo;s not clever or funny - it&rsquo;s grade school pointless. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very troubling. In 2 and 1/2 minutes or so he manages to announce himself as an imbecile and he&rsquo;s not even aware of it.<br>

		<p>Well, I think the Congressman is onto something.</p>
<p>Previously, it had been commonly supposed that islands were directly attached to The Giant Turtle (you know, the one under the ocean, holding up the world).  Congress, however, under the direction of Hank Johnson, possessing superior resources for scientific discovery and such-as, has determined that islands, in actuality, are floating bodies, subject to capsizing.</p>
<p>It is my personal belief that we must send Congressman Johnson on a worldwide &#8220;Save the Islands&#8221; tour, that he might warn The Malta and The Great Britain, and The Hong Kong, and such-as, that they could flip over at any minute (for our children).</p>

		<p>Wow, and to think there are actually standards to be a congressman. Let&rsquo;s see, with 200,000 people in an area about 200 square miles, that averages about 1000 people per sq mile. Granted a lot of the area of Guam is uninhabitable because it is a little peak of a mountain sticking out of the ocean. (I was stationed there back in the 1980&rsquo;s). </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even give this guy the benefit of the doubt with his concern about &#8220;carrying capacity&#8221; and overtaxing the infrastructure of the island. Back in the 1980&rsquo;s the telephone system on the island was installed in the 1950&rsquo;s and had a lot to be desired. This was just one of things you dealt with on a daily basis. But to think that 25000 extra people will &#8220;capsize&#8221; an area 3 times the size of Washington DC is ludicrous at best and dangerously incompetent at worst. </p>
<p>I feel sorry for the people of the 4th district of Georgia. Here are your choices, this clown, while wile lacking in mental capacity, doesn&rsquo;t appear to be very offensive or Cynthia McKinney. Talk about a Hobson&rsquo;s choice.    </p>

  That assertion (throwing millions of slaves overboard) is simply ludicrous.  And claiming that it changed the shark migrations is even more absurd   &mdash;    downright laughable. I haven&rsquo;t the statistics in front of me, but the scholarly figures I have seen show that the vast majority of African slaves brought to the New World  went to South America and the Caribbean, while only a relatively tiny number were brought to North America.  The fact that our millions of present &#8220;African-Americans&#8221; have multiplied and are descended from those few is evidence of how well they were treated and how good they had life here, in general, compared to back in Africa or elsewhere.  They were not worked to death or thrown overboard!&hellip;.. otherwise, where have these forty million  blacks come from?<br>
As Ranger said,  &#8220;if for no other reason&#8221;  that would have amounted to throwing valuable merchandise overboard&hellip;which no sane businessman is going to do.</p>
<p>  Such a childish, illogical, unsupported assertion by anybody is enough to brand that person as unworthy of serious attention.  And they wonder why they are not taken seriously!    Also, if blacks are so persecuted and oppressed in &#8220;racist&#8221; America, how come Mr. Lewis is allowed to be a  U.S.  Congressman?</p>

		<p>I have watched the video twice, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was NOT a joke - if only!!</p>
<p>The Congressman is clearly mentally impaired, possibly related to his medical condition, but other clips of him speaking are not much better.</p>
<p>as a recovering politically correct liberal on race, I conclude the following:<br>
this is a classic case of a mentally limited, astonishingly ignorant black occupying a position vastly beyond his capabilities and being covered by his (presumably white) staff members when he makes a gaff.</p>
<p>race liberals like myself are virtuosos at rationalizing the behavior of the many blacks who are mentally on the level of children:<br>
he was only kidding, he must&rsquo;ve been drunk, everyone has gaps in their knowledge, no one can know everything, anyone can have an off day, he didn&rsquo;t really mean to say that, he chose the wrong word, if only he had received a good education, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>http://www.ajc.com/news/rep-johnson-gaffe-guam-426715.html</p>
<p><br>
I went to the AJC site and Poster #4 JG is right: the three &#8220;gaffes&#8221; by white politicians are of a completely different nature. Hank Johnson&rsquo;s asinine worry about Guam tipping over like a canoe is a clear case of counterfactuality; whereas the three white pols that the AJC quotes are, as you can see, NOT asserting foolish and easily disproven factoids, but are merely matters of (unpopular) opinion: </p>
<p><br>
<i>Of course Johnson is hardly the only Peach State politician whose convoluted commentary has caused confusion. A few of the more memorable miscues:</i></p>
<p>* In 1996, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Atlanta, a Republican, made an unusual up-in-the-air link between beach volleyball and freedom. &#8220;A mere 40 years ago, beach volleyball was just beginning. No bureaucrat would have invented it, and that&rsquo;s what freedom is all about,&#8221; Gingrich said at the Republican National Convention.</p>
<p>* In 1976, Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter answered a question about public housing by saying people should be able to maintain the &#8220;ethnic purity&#8221; of their neighborhoods. Some saw Carter&rsquo;s remarks as a suggestion of segregation. He later explained he was referring to how people of particular nationalities sometimes like to live in concentrated areas.</p>
<p>* More recently, in September 2008, Republican U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland of Coweta County referred to then-presidential candidate Barack Obama and wife Michelle as &#8220;uppity&#8221;   &mdash;   a pejorative historically used by white Southerners to describe well-to-do African-Americans. Georgia-born Westmoreland later said he never heard the term used in a racially derogatory sense.</p>
<p><br>
I am no fan of Jimmy Carter, but at least he wasn&rsquo;t dumb enough to think islands can capsize if they get too many people on them. </p>

		<p>Yes, Guam is being overrun by brown tree snakes, a.k.a. Boiga irregularis, which were accidentally imported from either Australia or New Guinea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit curious about the remark in one respect: why wasn&rsquo;t this genius worried about Okinawa &#8220;capsizing and sinking&#8221; while the huge numbers of marines soon to be moved to Guam were stationed there, gang-raping schoolgirls and generally making themselves as well-loved as possible by the locals?</p>
<p>A &#8220;true leader&#8221;, huh?  What sort of moronic comment does one have to make these days in order to be called a &#8220;blithering idiot&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Well if this is true, he should also think that all aid and aid workers in Haiti should be removed so as to keep Haiti from &#8220;tipping over&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Indeed, it might be wise to sacrifice a lamb in order to prevent the island from tipping in the future.  Nature does seem contrary to sense.  If I drop a bullet from my hand at the same instant that I fire one from a gun horizontal to the earth at the same altitude, they will hit ground at the same time.  I see a lot of whites speed past me on the interstate without seat belts.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe no one on Amren has said the obvious.</p>
<p>This was NOT a joke.  It WAS a slip up of a low IQ person (an average IQ for a black man) groomed and trained to look normal so he can infiltrate our political system and help bring about anti-white policy.</p>
<p>Obama is no different, by the way.  They just spent more money training him.  But there are still many fine examples (57 US states, lol) you can find on Youtube.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised no enterprising white nationalists have begun infiltrating town hall meetings and news events to ask complicated, relevant questions using plain language so that an audience can understand the question and plainly see that the elected official does not.  A simple, covert plan that could severely restrict the viability of these candidates.</p>

		<p>Maybe he believes islands &#8220;float&#8221;.  Perhaps the recent submerging of some islands off the coast of India recently gave him that idea.  He may have thought they &#8220;sank&#8221;.  If someone were to explain to him that islands are basically under water mountains that reach above the sea&rsquo;s surface and that they only disappear because of storms, erosion, rising water levels or volcanic activity he might have a clearer view of how the world (or at least Guam) works.  Remember, back when he was in school the sciences were not taught to black students.</p>

		<p>I agree with some of the other comments: This sounds like an obvious joke meant solely to capture his concern about how large the population of American troops was becoming. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how anyone could watch that video and think he was joking.  He was deadly serious!  </p>
<p>He painstakingly laid out the approximate dimensions of the island (to illustrate it&rsquo;s canoe-like shape), then paused between &#8220;tip over&#8221; and &#8220;capsize&#8221; to make a tipping motion with his hands.  He thought he was making an excellent point.  He fully expected the Admiral to say something along the lines of, &#8220;My God!  We&rsquo;d better study that!&#8221;  </p>
<p>People want to make excuses for him, including some white nationalists, because it seems so <i>unbelievable</i> someone could be that stupid.  But, that&rsquo;s what the far left side of the Bell Curve looks like!  Many blacks truly <i>are</i> that low-IQ.  </p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the video.  That said, in my experience, blacks don&rsquo;t do deadpan humor.  If they&rsquo;re being sarcastic, they lay it on thick, smile, or otherwise make it plain they&rsquo;re joking.  I&rsquo;ve been around blacks all my life, and in my experience they neither employ or understand deadpan humor.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this sort of thing before, and that&rsquo;s my impression as well.  As I said, I haven&rsquo;t seen the video, but I&rsquo;m very familiar with whites refusing to believe the realities of low-IQ and racial differences in IQ.</p>
<p>Yes folks, stupid people <b>really are</b> stupid.</p>
<p>That said, for all I know the guy was joking; I&rsquo;m just figuring the odds.</p>

		<p>Because of affirmative action, people with this sort of logic become physicians, attorneys, airline pilots, police, judges, professors, teachers, generals, etc.  And then we wonder why nothing in the USA works and why the economy is crashing. When you place low-IQ people into leadership roles, you get Haiti or Detroit.  </p>
<p>Civilizations function and advance by putting the best and the brightest in leadership positions.  But in the last 50 years, we have literally turned our system of meritocracy up-side-down.  We now pour massive resources into the lowest IQ groups, in order to &#8220;close the gap.&#8221;  We advance people to top positions based on skin color, instead of ability.  Meanwhile, we cut programs for our brightest   &mdash;   the very people who could make the scientific and technological discoveries to advance our society &amp; economy.  We couple this with the importation of millions of low-IQ people from failed races   &mdash;   people who throughout history have never shown the ability to advance.   Pure insanity.</p>

		<p>If you look at the whole video segment, you can see that a use of any intellectual subtlety, or irony, is inconsistent with the rest of what he said. His entire discourse was nothing more than a verbal shipwreck. I don&rsquo;t know much about Johnson&rsquo;s past, or what maladies he might be suffering. But I suspect that we have some trolls and black apologists who are seeking out threads to do damage control. I know for a fact that there are black law school graduates who should never have graduated eigth grade, because I&rsquo;ve encountered them in court. I once taught a class for reserve police officers in which over half the attendees were black. Besides going out of my way to be very clear and deliberate in presenting the material, I went over the entire qualification exam question by question, and gave the answers.<br>
None of the whites failed. Over half the blacks did, and none of them scored over 80.<br>
  Who sends illiterate people to be police officers, lawyers and congressmen?  What university, let alone law school, awards a diploma to someone who is truly ignorant and of obviously inferior intelligence?  How can they think that anyone&rsquo;s best interests, at any level can be served by doing so?</p>

		<p>I watched the video, and there was no attempt at humor or play on words.  Most of what he said seemed somewhat confused   &mdash;   honestly, he sounded like he had had a mild stroke or was going into insulin shock.  I don&rsquo;t know if he has major medical problems or what, but it seemed to me that he was serious when he suggested that the island might capsize. But even if you had a stroke or had low blood sugar   &mdash;   you still would not say such a stupid thing.  I think he really thought that islands float.</p>
<p>Is this the type of guy you want flying your airplane or operating on your brain?</p>
