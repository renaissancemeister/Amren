<h1><a href="https://www.americanconservativedaily.com/2010/04/tea-party-stands-with-arizona/ ">Tea Party Stands With Arizona</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dale Robertson, TeaParty.org, April 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona law says their state has an obligation to protect its citizens, and to be accurate, Uncle Sam has repeatedly failed to protect Border States.</p>
<p>I was not surprise the decision was handed down in favor of the Arizona Citizens. Furthermore, I believe Arizona has a solid argument to back up their safety claim.</p>
<p>Example, last year, Phoenix, Arizona was named the &#8220;kidnapping capitol&#8221; of America, but it doesn&rsquo;t end there. The majority of those Phoenix abductions were the results of the Mexican drug cartel wars just a few miles south over the Mexican border.</p>
<p>Who can forget just a few weeks ago, an Arizonan rancher with a history of assisting illegal aliens cross the border was shot and killed on his own property, by what some claim, was a gunman who fled across the border back into Mexico. The irony is, many of the illegal aliens who trespassed over his land, trashed in the process, his thank you was Death.</p>
<p>Since Washington has thrown the Constitution under the bus and views it as a &#8220;living document&#8221; a new era of quasi-interpretations are boiling forth from the Washington stink tanks. After reviewing the 10th Amendment with the new eyes of progressive thinking one can only ask the question, &#8220;Should our nation function without law?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Get this, our United States, has been run by the federal government, who, holds the power to protect the borders. However, the federal government has failed miserably to not only protect our borders, but in some cases created a attractive nuisance to attract illegal aliens into our beloved nation. Therefore, one can argue that Washington has abandoned their rights of protection, since the Constitution is now living, it can now create new ways to rule us.</p>
<p>Because of the lax and disingenuous actions of the federal government who have chosen not to protect our borders, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the problem of national trespass evaporates! This means the Border States are hung out to dry, in other words, they must protect themselves. Point taken is because a right is not exercised doesn&rsquo;t mean that right is destroyed. But the obligation not fulfill a right can be considered an obligation which has been abandoned.</p>
<p>Arizona to Washington: &#8220;You have abandoned us, we must protect ourselves&#8221;</p>
<p>Washington to Arizona: &#8220;just because we aren&rsquo;t protecting you, doesn&rsquo;t mean you can protect yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of all the gall, one would think Washington should be shamed of destroying its own Citizens, but no! Instead they are fighting for their right to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, do absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>The Tea Party? We stand with Arizona and why shouldn&rsquo;t we. The federal government doesn&rsquo;t give a hoot about us, except we are the cash cows they must keep milking and if a few of us are murdered, kidnapped or abducted into Mexico, well that the cost of doing business!</p>

		<p>Tea partiers have always been anti-illegal immigrant focused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how it got started on this forum that they weren&rsquo;t.  ALLIPAC speaks at their gatherings often and is THE most effective organization of all the sub groups.</p>
<p>And, speaking of sub-groups, the tea partiers are not only Mr. and Mrs. average American, they are also people from hundreds of conservative groups who want to remain separate, but who will join in on any protests, etc., as they arise.</p>
<p>If this movement keeps going as it has this last year (plus), it is going to be a force to be reckoned with.  Whites make up 75% of the elctorate, so discounting the 20% who are rabid, airhead type liberals who love to be beaten and spit on by non-whites, the remaining millions will be able to control any federal election coming up.</p>
<p>Obama appealed to Women, blacks, Hispanics and &#8220;young people&#8221; (Whatever that means), but never once included white males.  I wonder how those effeminant types feel about being ignored?</p>

<p>The above statement is untrue.  In fact the Federal Government cares very much about you.  It cares about your money, because it needs your money (taxes) so it can transfer it to illegal immigrants and Third World invaders.  Now, pay your taxes or go to jail.  And stop trying to stop the invasion. </p>

<p>If they call a Tea Party member or other Conservatives, racist, they might get ideas and actually become one.  If the Leftist say nothing the they still might become a racist out of necessity.  </p>
<p>In the end one is either pro-white  or  pro-white genocide.</p>

		<p>The Tea Party to date has limited its agenda to lower taxes and smaller government. I think it&rsquo;s about time Tea Partiers payed attention to immigration. After all, Tea Party goals will never be attained if the destruction of our country by unwanted immigration continues. I know, however, that as Tea Party goals and aspirations broaden there is a greater chance its soladarity will lessen. Sadly, there are apparently some good people who think immigration is a good thing and those who simply feel sorry for illegals. If immigration is not severely limited, and then to only those with desired skills, our once great nation is lost and will become largely unlivable for decent people with traditional values. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true but as someone who has actually been to a Tea Party, I certainly don&rsquo;t like the way they contort themselves over making it clear that they have no problem with nonwhite immigrants as long as they come legally.  I guess they won&rsquo;t mind then if Congress writes up a &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; bill that requires illegals to return to Mexico just long enough to get their green cards from the US Embassy.  They can have them all ready for them to pickup when they get there, no fuss, no wait.  What could possibly be the objection then?  Seriously, I&rsquo;ve had enough of this retarded PC nonsense from cowardly conservatives.   </p>

<p>As Jared Taylor has said, the TEA Parties have been, to date, pretty aracial. But they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to STAY that way. </p>
<p>Considering what a wide selection of whites the TEA movement brings together, there may be room under the TEA umbrella for a more race-conscious faction or two. Or at least an anti-immigration faction, one perhaps aligned with or overlapping the Minutemen. </p>
<p>That the founder/president of TeaParty.org has chosen to speak up about the new law in AZ is encouraging. Immigration SHOULD be a TEA Party issue   &mdash;   it is, after all, one of the main reasons why we whites are Taxed Enough Already! </p>
<p>White Advocates who don&rsquo;t think the TEA movement is racially aware enough, it would behoove you to crash these Parties; to infiltrate them and attempt to wake the tax protestors up to just how much of their &#8220;tax&#8221; complaints are in fact complaints against blacks and browns. Then to nudge the TEA leaders to be a little bolder on these issues, and to move the movement in a more explicitly pro-white direction. </p>

		<p>Legal immigration is being abused almost as badly as illegal immigration right now.  Our gov&rsquo;t handed out over 1 million green cards last year while over 3 million citizens lost their freakin&rsquo; jobs!  We need a complete moratorium on any more legal immigration, to go along with border enforcement that stops illegal crossings, to really see where we stand economically.</p>

		<p>Since when have Tea Partiers been against illegal immigration???  Since NEVER, as far as I know!  No Tea Partier I&rsquo;m aware of has ever been supportive of illegal immigration.  We stand FOR Arizona and we&rsquo;re encouraging Texas to follow AZ&rsquo;s lead and enact their own tough anti-illegal immigration act.  It&rsquo;s true that the Feds haven&rsquo;t gotten off their behinds to do anything for us border states, so we have every right to take care of it ourselves.  In fact we have a RESPONSIBILITY to every one of our citizens to get it handled!  So Tea Partiers definitely do support AZ and all the border states in legislating tough anti-illegal immigration laws AND in enforcing same.</p>

		<p>I read/post extensively on Newsvine.com and the major thrust of the liberal left/Democrats being anti-Tea Party diatribes for the Tea Party&rsquo;s perceived racism. I urge all AmRen readers to get involved on Newsvine. To remind the liberal left how negatively immigration from Latin America has impacted our nation.</p>
<p>GET INVOLVED! Post on Newsvine&rsquo;s comments under the appropriate articles and force the liberal left to understand those of us against Amnesty, against continued immigration are much more numerous than the left wing liberals would like to believe or admit.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigration is one of the largest financial drains on this country as well as the crime they bring, the overcrowding of our classrooms, prisons and medical facilities. And, if nothing else, being illegal means against the law. These people laugh at our laws and our borders and the President wants to make them citizens. We must keep fighting against that until they&rsquo;re all gone through brave states doing what Arizona has done. We cannot support the world. Illegal&rsquo;s home countries need to take care of their own. It&rsquo;s not our job!</p>

		<p>Those Tea Partiers, if there really ARE any, who believe continued illegal immigration is not a factor in their chosen causes better rethink that.  There is a DIRECT link between big government and illegal immigration, between inflated taxes and illegal immigration, between the collapse of public services and hospitals and illegal immigration, and between the hated Obamacare and illegal immigration.  Lastly, Obama and the liberals RELY upon illegal immigrants to keep them all in power indefinitely once an amnesty is rammed through.  Add 30 million staunch voters for big liberal government overnight, and the Obama types remain in power regardless the white majority vote against him and his Marxist agenda.  So, Tea Partiers, ignore the &#8220;racist&#8221; taunts and realize illegal immigration has EVERYTHING  to do with the programs against which you protest.  It should be clear that when the nazi-KGB like liberal thugs are forced to beat on you physically and disrupt your meetings, you are being effective and are feared, and it is the very people calling you racist and nazi who ARE the racists and nazis.  It&rsquo;s time white people laugh in the face of such vapid accusations, and push back when shoved.  </p>

<p>Unlike Europe, here in the United States immigration from Muslim countries and Africa has been relatively low. I expect that as legal immigration from those countries soars due to their high birth rates, the refugee racket, the visa lottery, and the fact there are plenty of family members to bring in by family reunification, people will eventually turn against legal immigration. But it might take a while.</p>

		<p>Immigration is one of those issues that have broad bipartisan appeal.  ONLY the liberal ELITE want more immigrants, legal and otherwise.  The rank and file do not&hellip;.this includes a great many hispanics already living in the country.  This doesn&rsquo;t make much sense from a racial realist point of view but makes perfect sense once you realize that spanish speaking neighborhoods absorb far more of the cost, crime and problems that are being brought into the country.</p>
<p>But that is a separate issue.  Just look at any pro-immigrant rally.  Outside a handful of kooks, 99% of them are mexicans without citizenship.</p>
<p>This is important information for the tea party groups.  Although most are conservatives, a large number are actually liberals.  For decades now, we have had a one party with two heads system.  No matter who is in power, the agenda is the same and ignores both the left and the right.  But now the left and the right are discovering that they can find common ground and compromise.</p>
<p>Immigration is only one issue.</p>
