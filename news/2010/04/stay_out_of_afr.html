<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/16/big-brother-attitude-africa-zimbabwe-machel">Stay Out of Africa This Time, Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s Wife Tells Britain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Smith, Guardian (London), April 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of Africa&rsquo;s most eminent political figures has condemned Britain for taking a patronising &#8220;big brother&#8221; attitude to its former colonies.</p>
<p>Graça Machel, a founder member of the Elders group of world leaders and the wife of Nelson Mandela, warned British politicians to &#8220;keep quiet&#8221; about countries such as Zimbabwe and let African diplomacy take its course.</p>
<p>Machel, 64, is a former first lady of Mozambique, where she served as education minister, and has won numerous international awards for her advocacy of women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Guardian in Johannesburg, she indicated that the crisis in Zimbabwe has revealed the shortcomings of a persistent imperialist mindset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I be a little bit provocative?&#8221; Machel said. &#8220;I think this should be an opportunity for Britain to re-examine its relationship with its colonies. To acknowledge that with independence those nations will want to have a relationship with Britain which is of shoulder to shoulder, and they will not expect Britain to continue to be the big brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a nation is independent, there is no big brother. They are partners. Part of the reason why Britain finds it difficult to accept Zimbabwe is precisely because that relationship of a big brother is influencing [efforts] to try to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Britain, along with the EU and US, has imposed travel restrictions and asset freezes on Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe and his political and business allies. It has defied calls from South Africa to end these measures for the sake of the power sharing agreement between Mugabe&rsquo;s Zanu-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).</p>
<p>Earlier this year David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said the UK would be &#8220;guided by what the MDC says to us about the conditions under which it is working and leading the country&#8221;. Critics said this handed Zanu-PF a propaganda coup, allowing it to portray the MDC as a puppet of Britain and blame it for sanctions.</p>
<p>Machel added: &#8220;I&rsquo;m not saying things are OK, they&rsquo;re all fine in Zimbabwe. I&rsquo;m saying a different kind of dialogue, a different kind of bridge to try to understand the other side could have produced a different result from what it is.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more the British shout, the worse the situation will be in terms of relationship with Zimbabwe. That&rsquo;s why sometimes I really question, when something happens in Zimbabwe and Britain shouts immediately. Can&rsquo;t they just keep quiet? Sometimes you need just to keep quiet. Let them do their own things, let SADC (Southern African Development Community) deal with them, but keep quiet, because the more you shout, the worse [it is].&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if Britain&rsquo;s attitude is patronising to its former colonies, Machel replied: &#8220;I&rsquo;m afraid so. And what I&rsquo;m saying is they have expectations which do not always coincide with what are the aspirations and expectations of those who are their former colony.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you change the relationship, you just have to give yourself to take the humility to stop and listen. And when you listen, then you take into account the other side. You put your case, then you take the other side. In a way, you harmonise interests of both sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zimbabwe will mark 30 years of independence this weekend. Britain remains politically and economically influential and denies Mugabe&rsquo;s claim that it reneged on promises to fund the redistribution of land to the black majority. Mugabe&rsquo;s response, the chaotic seizure of white-owned farms, has been blamed for the collapse of Zimbabwean agriculture.</p>
<p>Machel, whose first husband was the late Mozambique president Samora Machel, called on Britain to take a broader view of the African continent. &#8220;That&rsquo;s one of the issues, particularly with the British people: because of the emotional attachment they have with Zimbabwe, in many cases they define the continent in terms of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is one country among 53 countries, so you have all the rest of 52 countries. Well, let us put aside Somalia also, which is a failed state. But you have 50 countries who are running a relatively normal situation in the continent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to raise with you the issue that yes, Zimbabwe has failed, and it is hurting British people directly, but there&rsquo;s much, much more to Africa than Zimbabwe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Machel, who became Mandela&rsquo;s third wife in 1998, also accused developed countries of double standards on CO2 emissions and climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been very clearly stated at the negotiations to Copenhagen. They know  &mdash;  the developing world, including China  &mdash;  that Africa has very small responsibility in the impact of climate change, but Africa is the one paying the highest price.&#8221;</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s intentions are still treated with scepticism in Zimbabwe, even among some members of the MDC. Eddie Cross, policy co-ordinator general of the MDC, said: &#8220;Perfidious Albion. I tell you, you Brits have a well-deserved reputation for perfidity in your colonial relations &hellip; I think Britain&rsquo;s always been very sophisticated in its relations with its former colonies  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s got more experience than any other state in the world  &mdash;  but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make them right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Britain&rsquo;s role in the last 10 years has often been difficult for us in the MDC to interpret and read. Sometimes they&rsquo;ve backed certain initiatives in Zimbabwe which have not been helpful in terms of pursuing a principled transfer of power and I think sometimes the Brits regard us as being rather naïve in the MDC and they have a rather jaundiced view of Africa and African politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Cross, an economist and MP, added that other European powers probably behaved worse: &#8220;Samora Machel once said to me: &#8216;If you were to choose to be colonised, you would never choose to be colonised by the Portuguese.&rsquo; The colonial record was pretty dismal. For the British it was probably the best.&#8221;<br>

		<p>As the British are, in large part, the cause of the problems for white people in South Africa (both historically and in the past few decades), they should accept, without reservation, every white person from that tragic land who wishes to emigrate.  Same for any whites left in Zimbabwe.  Oh, and no blacks from Zimbabwe or SA should be permitted to emigrate to Britain.</p>

		<p>People are dying and being killed by the scores, mismanagement on a colossally ridiculous level, human rights violations, inflation beyond the Wiemar-Republic level, in short, a typically Black-African run country (Zimbabwe that is)and blame gets leveled at Great Britain.</p>
<p>England is concerned because it once was their colony.</p>
<p>So let England and others keep quiet and Zimbabwe and other African nations will solve this, Please! </p>

		<p>Zimbabwe in the year 2010&hellip;.South Africa in the year 2020 if not sooner. Just look at the record of self rule in AFrica. Can we be surprised that we see the same problem there as we see here in the US? It is somebody else&rsquo;s fault, not ours; you owe us; give us money, but don&rsquo;t try to tell us how to spend it or what to spend it on.<br>
The colonial powers did things wrong that is true. But in the last 50 years one might think that the Africans would have figured out some sort of responsibility. But like here in the US,<br>
progress will never be made until the last of the &#8220;old guard&#8221; has died and younger more reasonable leaders step forward, if they exist.</p>

<p><br>
On this much the Michelle Obama of South Africa is correct: </p>
<p>The British, upon relinquishing control of former colonies in the 1960s/70s, had expectations that, given Black Rule, Africans would be able to maintain their own countries at First World levels. By Machel&rsquo;s own admission, this expectation is unrealistic because Africans are INHERENTLY INCAPABLE of this. </p>

		<p>I wish someone would have told this to Britain decades ago when they were bent on destroying successful nations like Rhodesia and South Africa. I wonder why Britain and America need to interfere in these hellholes. Leave them alone in their squalor. The best foreign policy for any White nation is isolation as much as practically possible from the non-White (and possibly the non-Yellow) world. The more Whites stay apart from Non-Whites, the better is it for White people.  </p>

		<p>What really annoys me is that the UK labour party have erected a statue in parliment square, opposite Winston Churchill of Nelson Mandela. I would like to know why a convicted mass-murdering terrorist, who has done nothing for the UK and is not British is accorded the same status as Churchill in our capital city?- This to me symbolizes perfectly what is wrong with the west and why Africans like Mandela and his ANC ilk, Mugabe et.al will continue the double standard shake-down and why the west will keep sucking it up. Pathetic.</p>

		<p>It is not likely I will be making a popular statement here. Ideally, I think the Western World should cut off ties with Africa and various other non-White nations. If I desire a White Utopia, it would be hipocritical for me to claim Whites have a right in Africa any more than Africans in America. I would like to see white from Africa brought back to Europe or find a new home in her Culture extensions. This would be hardly easy for African whites to swallow. You could say the same about blacks in America. Back during the Second World War however, Germans were expelled from East Prussia. Life goes on. I am honestly quite sick of the resistence of our people to make sacrifice. </p>
<p>That being said, I know we are far off from trading American blacks for African whites. I would favor segregation as well, but that is just as far off.</p>

<p>South African whites have been here for aslong as American whites have been in America. We built a nation from scratch. Tell me why South Africa is different in anyway to that of America.</p>
<p>The Bantus, the so called indigenous population of South Africa, migrated from what is now the Congo region to South Africa and crossed the Limpopo river around the same time as the Dutch landed in the Cape. Many regions in South Africa were unpopulated and not fit for agriculture until the whites irrigated and built dams to make it fit for crops. For these reasons there are many places such as the Western and Northern Cape, even the old Natal, Orange Free State and certain parts of the old Transvaal, that whites have more right to than the Bantus (Zulu and Xhosa) tribes of South Africa.</p>
<p>Why, given these reasons, should whites leave a country they built? The only reason why blacks out number whites in South Africa is due to the intervention of white medicine and farming techniques. During Apartheid the black population soared to almost 10 to 15 times what it was in the early 1900s. Blacks owe everything that South Africa is and was to whites. The only reason South Africa stays afloat currently is due to the 4 million whites who continue to work and farm and thus keep the economy going. This country is our life. For many whites it has been their home for almost 350 years. </p>
<p>Please stop with the comments telling us to leave as it is similar to me telling you to leave America. If you want to comment on South African issues please come up with solutions that allow us to stay in our land of birth and the land we shed blood and worked so hard to build up. </p>
<p>Also, please take note of the previous article about Brandon Huntley, as he was a South African white who tried to claim asylum and leave South Africa. Look at the media storm one white caused for daring to challenge the rainbow nation farce. Many South African whites do not have the option to simply go to European, American or Australian countries and therefore need to use methods like Huntley did to leave South Africa. Ask yourself a question. If a man who was assaulted and stabbed 7 times and who had been racially abused and discriminated against because of his skin colour, who was also abused by Canadian Authorities and media by having his name dragged through the mud. If he might not be able to stay. What chance to normal white South Africans have to claim refugee status?</p>

		<p>When even National Geographic starts taking notice and actually prints the truth, it has to be pretty obvious. In this past month&rsquo;s Water issue, they mentioned the fact that time and again, (white) charities have set up water wells or production facilities. Of 35 such projects, only 9 continued to function after control was turned over to the &#8216;locals&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They cannot either build civilization or even maintain one given them as a gift. But also take note (as China grows) the blacks don&rsquo;t mind (yet) the oriental colonization of their benighted continent.</p>
