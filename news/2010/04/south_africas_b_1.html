<h1>South Africa&rsquo;s Black Brain Drain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Subashni Naidoo, Times Live (Johannesburg), April 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Almost half of South Africa&rsquo;s middle-class black teenagers plan to flee the country for greener pastures.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous politicians, escalating crime, poor employment prospects and low education standards are behind a growing desire among the country&rsquo;s black youth to leave.</p>
<p>In contrast, only 33% white and Indian youth want to go, reflecting a hardening of attitudes among black youngsters who have increasingly lost confidence in government.</p>
<p>The latest national BratTrax study conducted by research group Youth Dynamix reveals that although most black teenagers between 13 and 15 want to stay put, 42% are disillusioned and plan to leave as soon as they can.</p>
<p>The study, conducted this year, included face-to-face interviews with 900 youngsters aged seven to 15 in eight of the nine provinces.</p>
<p>While previous research showed that this group were positive about the developments in government and believed they would benefit, they had now lost confidence in their leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are questioning our leaders and their capabilities. They are feeling disillusioned,&#8221; said research director Andrea Kraushaar.</p>
<p>Reflecting views similar to their white and Indian counterparts, 71% of black youth felt it was impossible to get employment in South Africa; 58% said crime made them want to live in another country, and 73% felt government was not living up to its promises.</p>
<p>Professor Lawrence Schlebusch, an expert in behavioural medicine, said his research of stress and suicidal behaviour showed that stress levels were incredibly high among youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;They tend to experience alienation from their own value systems and the main reason for this is because they had great expectations of the new South Africa and these expectations are not being met.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is much harder for them now. They are finding it more difficult to get into university, the unemployment rate is far higher and there seems to be more and more polarisation,&#8221; said Schlebusch.<br>

		<p>The difference in statistics might be that the whites actually contributed to the creation of South Africa and those along for the ride have no vested interest in the country. Thus, they flee when things go bad.</p>

		<p>Black Brain Drain?  That&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious! How utterly stupid to even suggest such a thing.</p>
<p>These blacks are no more than the average 70 I.Q. types who comprise the average black, but even if they weren&rsquo;t being gifted in Africa means having an average I.Q. of about 85&hellip;maybe 90.  In the US that would qualify them for what the blacks are doing right now, which is manual labor, service jobs, or fast food experts.</p>

		<p>The age old story.  Blacks behave like blacks.  It gets intolerable.  Some blacks leave.  Those blacks now begin behaving like blacks in their new location.  It gets intolerable.  Some blacks leave.  THOSE blacks begin behaving like blacks in their new location&hellip;..and so it goes.  Black blight spreads, white flight is running out of places to flee to.</p>

		<p>Funny, I don&rsquo;t recall large numbers of blacks wanting to leave Rhodesia or Apartheid-era South Africa.</p>
<p>And the small number who wanted to emigrate wanted to go to other white-run countries. </p>

There  is  indeed  the  term  &#8220;brain  drain&#8221;  which migration scholars  use  for  the  flow  of  educated  Africans  to  the  West. An easily checked  statistic  is  the  one  concerning African  medical  doctors  and  nurses in  Europe  and  the  U.S.<br>
For example, there  are relatively very  large  numbers  of  credentialed doctors from Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, etc.  practicing in  U.S. hospitals. The same for  nurses  &mdash;  especially in Britain.</p>
<p>There  are  also  relatively significant  numbers  of  Africans  who  have managed  to  earn  doctorates in  the  West and  Africa  who  are  now  tenured  professors[you  have  to  have  a  minimum number  of  publications in  peer reviewed journals or  to  have  written books  published  by  recognized  publishers]at  American and European  universities.]in almost  any  academic area. You can easily check  this.</p>
<p>So  your highly  speculative statement  is  just  wrong.<br>

		<p>Well, black Africans flocked to SA to avail themselves of the opportunities created by the British and Dutch settlers. Now that they&rsquo;ve dispossessed the whites and are busily destroying the country, they want to move to other white-controlled territories.  </p>

<p>Quick question. Why don&rsquo;t all these &#8220;Educated Africans&#8221; stay in their own countries? If they are so brilliant, as you seem to suggest, surely they are capable of building their own economies.</p>
<p>Oh wait, thats right, all African economies are wasting away and have achieved nothing since their independence. These Africans should be made to stay in South Africa, and enjoy their freedom, as they are the ones who keep telling us how evil we whites are. If white people are so evil and racist why don&rsquo;t blacks just stay away from them?</p>
<p>However, the white South Africans who built that country through their hard work should be afforded the right to emigrate as they were forced to hand it over to terrorist Marxists like you. We warned the world what would happen to our beloved country, South Africa, but were told we were wrong and racist. Time to enjoy the ANC you released.</p>
<p>By the way, I would not give a care if Africans were so darn clever that they created all the inventions in the world, if they would just stay in their countries and build them up themselves. Imagine if the African black was as clever as you suggest and they actually built Africa into a thriving economy. If that were the case we would not even be having this conversation as South Africa would be a hive of action and prosperity. Unfortunately, it is slowly becoming another African failure and eventually the evil white man will be left to pick up the pieces. </p>
<p>With all these &#8220;clever Africans&#8221; you would think they would be thriving now with their ill won freedom from the evil white man, but alas they are not. Now they seek to once again flock to white countries to destroy them from the inside out. </p>
<p>Separation is the only cure. If we don&rsquo;t do this soon, war will be the only option.</p>

		<p>Anonymous to ICE.  Your argument is exceptionalism and vapid.  The usual liberal slant.  Your premise and argument is no more valid than saying Seven Hawking or Albert Einstein are representative of all white men.  By and large and on the average, ICE has it correctly, not you.  We won&rsquo;t even go into which universities your black doctors graduated from and how easily they were tenured, or how gratuitously their papers were accepted.  I know this:  I&rsquo;d sooner have an asian or Indian doctor work on me.  NEVER a black doctor.  Ever.</p>

		<p>To #6:  Yes, there are black doctorates, but a doctorate earned in an African country is always suspect, and doctorates earned by Africans in the U.S. are the usually the result of affirmative action.  Not equivalent.</p>

		<p>Blacks have a habit of not looking too far into the future.  They always live in the moment without fear of consequences, because everyone else will have to live with them.  Is it any wonder why blacks have all these kids and can&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t raise them?  Is it any wonder why blacks get rich and then are broke and can&rsquo;t pay their income tax?  </p>

<p>How many of these doctorates are in real fields that have nothing to with African history, black studies or the victimology industry?  Don&rsquo;t just talk, provide some sources.</p>

		<p>Be interesting to see the impact of this transfer of higher-IQ blacks from Africa to, presumably North America and Europe. Will this cause an even further disintegration of African countries, while perhaps infusing minority communities in the Western world with better leadership?</p>
<p><i>Reflecting views similar to their white and Indian counterparts, 71% of black youth felt it was impossible to get employment in South Africa; 58% said crime made them want to live in another country, and 73% felt government was not living up to its promises.</i></p>
<p>These are some of the reasons that Whites give for leaving the new SA. So what does this say about the much vaunted end to apartheid that majority rule can not make the country work? </p>
<p>As usual, these lessons will be lost on the multicultists in the Western world. </p>
