<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6964767.html">When Too Much Rides on Rims</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Tolson, Houston Chronicle, April 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shiny, unmistakable and a little strange, the custom wire wheels of choice on some of Houston&rsquo;s toughest streets are the star attraction of whatever they&rsquo;re beneath, be it Benz or Bentley, certified slab or laughable junker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For more than two decades these unconventional rims, going by nicknames like swangers, elbows and pokes, have been coveted as none other by the car enthusiasts in Houston&rsquo;s poor black neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Those who live there, who ride there, who pay attention to what rolls down the streets, are fully aware of their allure. They also know well the mayhem that sometimes comes from possessing something so desirable.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have created an adverse culture of killing,&#8221; said community activist Quanell X.</p>
<p>DeAndre Elliott heard the siren and could not resist, and so his 1993 Buick Park Avenue was suitably equipped. </p>
<p>If Elliott had concern for his safety, it was not enough to overcome the pride in ownership. A junior at Worthing High School, he had no time for worry. He&rsquo;d been through the bad times, losing his mother at an early age, and come through the other side. </p>
<p>He was the popular star running back of the football team. He had a girlfriend. He had something in short supply in the grittiest neighborhoods  &mdash;  hope  &mdash;  and of course he had that car painted a fresh blue-green and finished off with elbows and white-walled Vogues, the only tire worthy of pairing with such expensive rims.</p>
<p>Elliott died Nov. 19 on his girlfriend&rsquo;s doorstep. He was 17. The only motive police could determine for the shooting was robbery: The assailant wanted Elliott&rsquo;s car, which is to say his rims. The shooter rode off in it as Elliott lay dying.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If Houston&rsquo;s rappers are quick to praise the rims, they are just as eager to cite the risk, if one bothers to listen. Then again, the acknowledged, danger may add to the appeal, lessening the intrusion of imitators and wannabes. If you roll on swangers, you roll ready. Self-defense is a required add-on to the purchase price of $2,000 or more. </p>
<p>&#8220;The police will never admit it, but if they want to catch young black men with guns, they&rsquo;ll stop a car with elbows and Vogues because they know the young men will have guns,&#8221; Quanell X said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly a Texas thing, the pursuit of the poke, but the story of rim-inspired violence has been written and rewritten in most major cities around the country. Up north, &#8220;spinners&#8221; had their appeal, admired for their continuing movement when the car stops. In greater Miami, the rimjackers have killed for Vogues atop &#8220;Trus,&#8221; a different sort of wire wheel. In southern California, it&rsquo;s Dayton wire wheels, slang translation &#8220;danas,&#8221; made famous by Snoop Dogg. Elbows might get you laughed at in Los Angeles. It takes danas to get you shot.</p>
<p>To many rimjackers, the wheels are nothing more than a fungible commodity, a high-demand item that can be quickly turned into cash. To others, they are the prize in and of themselves, representing a quick ticket to acceptance. </p>
<p>&#8220;You have individuals who don&rsquo;t have other options to get respect and get achievement in our society,&#8221; said Luis Salinas, a University of Houston sociologist and criminologist. &#8220;Instead, they focus on one little item, and they do what they have to do to get it. They may not have a good home or anything else, but they can have a set of killer rims.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are rules of a sort for rolling on swangers. Street rules, written nowhere but known to many. </p>
<p>Besides the advantage of numbers and enough firepower to make it meaningful, you are careful where you park and careful about women who approach you in clubs with interest that comes a little too easy. </p>
<p>Too often the careless find themselves marks for an affectionate offer that ends with a quick phone call to an associate with a gun.</p>
<p>Therein lies the eternal paradox of the poke. You get them to be noticed, but it&rsquo;s getting noticed that makes you a target.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hip-hop culture has its own car fetish, all of it falling under the general label of &#8220;urban vehicles.&#8221; </p>
<p>They can run from tricked-out SUVs on 20-inch &#8220;dubs&#8221; to old sedans on oversized wheels (referred to as &#8220;donks&#8221;) known to Houston&rsquo;s own slabs, a nickname born of an acronym  &mdash;  &#8220;slow, loud and bangin&rsquo;.&#8221; </p>
<p>The true slab is usually an older American sedan or convertible. Many slabs boast a meticulously redone interior, and all feature serious sound systems with massive woofers in the trunk, and elbows and Vogues.</p>
<p>In theory, a sweet looking slab would be just as fine on any set of decent wheels: a nice set of racing mags, say, or some luxe Giovannas or even a more toned-down set of wire rims. </p>
<p>But no elbows means no slab. Simple as that, anyone will tell you. People would wonder about you. And they would laugh. </p>
<p>Swangers pull it all together, for better, for worse. <br>

		<p>Rims!Rims! How cool they are.The plunderers of the Bl;ack  Muslim Bakery in Oakland, (remember it?)used moolah from the bakery after Yousef Bey died to buy Automotive Bling Bling (rims) that cost$6000!One of the offspring of the sperm spreaader welfare plunderer Bey was robbed of his Rims, and the robbery turned out bad for him(he was killed). The killer was black, naturally.At his funeral, Bey was sobbing crocodile tears. Cry me a River!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Riiiiigght.  It was the rims that created an &#8220;adverse culture of killing&#8221;, and certainly not all the drugs that CRACK-DEALER Quanell X sold during his lifetime.  Other than being run out of town during the Joe Horn incident, Quanell X has done little in the way of &#8220;community activism&#8221; during his life.  But he certainly has sold an awful lot of drugs.</p>

		<p>Several years ago, someone gave me the circular for one of these wheel places in St. Louis.  The catch with this place is that you can rent them to own, they&rsquo;re that expensive.  I scanned the circular in for my own blog:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/y3dk2wo" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/y3dk2wo</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of these are/were &#8220;spinners,&#8221; and I imagine those are a grand or two more expensive.  I&rsquo;m sure that a lot of these blacks like to put chrome spinners on cars that are worth less than the spinners.  Plus the obligatory 1,000-watt subwoofer, that&rsquo;s also worth more than the car.  I don&rsquo;t catch the drift of that.</p>

 as for<br>
quannel x, His opinion is meaningless as a  former Farrakhan race hustler.  Here is a Wikipedia quote attributed to him.</p>
<p>Quanell X was forced out of the Nation of Islam for publicly inciting violence with his televised, and highly publicized, exhortation to Houston-area blacks:</p>
<p>    &#8220;[i]f you feel that you just got to mug somebody because of your hurt and your pain, go to River Oaks and mug you some good white folks. If you&rsquo;re angry that our brother is put to death, don&rsquo;t burn down your own community, give these white folks hell from the womb to the tomb.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Believe it or not, the major national &#8220;Rent-to-Own&#8221; furniture and appliance stores ($500.00 retail price at Sears refrigerator for $50.00 a week) have arrangements with national importers of Chinese made hoopty rims and tires to do &#8220;Rent-to-Own&#8221; contracts for a set of bling wheels. The Rent-to-Own repo guys now have to carry cinder blocks and car jacks to fully do their yobs. How&rsquo;s that for a national economy?</p>
<p>And my tire man tells me that with 12K miles dragging da skreets in da hood on a set of hoopties and there&rsquo;ll not be a single tight screw, nut, or bolt in the Caprice as over 80% of the suspension&rsquo;s funcional shock absorbing capacity is gone.</p>
<p>All goes to show that all ya have to do is give Blacks what deh want.</p>

		<p><i> He had something in short supply in the grittiest neighborhoods &mdash; hope</i></p>
<p>Hmm, funny, I thought &#8220;hope&#8221; was provided in abundance by the election of Obama.</p>
<p>But lets think about that sentence, and all the unquestioned assumptions it carries. Why is hope &#8220;in short supply&#8221; in the grittiest (read black) neighborhoods? </p>
<p>Is it because of the low average IQ of the inhabitants? Lack of a work ethic? Wildly misplaced priorities? Or is it due to vicious, intractable white racism? Of course the standard &#8220;wisdom&#8221; is the latter. </p>
<p>And what does it say about a people that so many of them in such supposedly poor circumstances put such a priority in such foolish baubles? </p>
<p>Lastly and most importantly, what does it say about a people when they are willing to kill each other over such idiocy? </p>
<p>These are the crucial questions, but they are ones that neither this or any other MSM writer will ever ask.</p>

		<p>I live in California so I am well aware of the phenomenon of gigantic, expensive rims on bad cars. (The cars are referred to as &#8220;scrapers&#8221; rather than &#8220;slabs&#8221; out here though.) My question is how these cretins can afford this stuff? I mean, yeah, drugs of course but still&hellip;  </p>
<p>I mean, I see (and hear) these things every time I leave my apartment, are there really that many dope pushers in my little town?</p>

		<p>This sort of thinking and behavior has always gone on in the ghetto.  Now, through the infusion of hip-hop into the mainstream culture, everyone is at least aware of it, if not copying the styles.  Of course, middle class people have a choice as to whether they don trousers copied from belt-less, low-slung jail and prison attire (that most ghetto males will be familiar with), but the non-wealthy law-abiding have no choice if their own neighborhoods and shopping areas are invaded by criminals.  </p>

		<p>As usual, another ridiculous aspect of black behavior.  Other minority groups like the Jews and Italians underwent a period of material flashiness to show that &#8220;they made it.&#8221;  At least this was true in New York City where I grew up.  I remember for example ethnic slurs about Cadillacs like &#8220;Jew canoes&#8221; and &#8220;Guinea clippers.&#8221;  But the difference is that every ethnic group except blacks outgrow this constant need for attention and showiness.  IQ differences, anyone?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The police will never admit it, but if they want to catch young black men with guns, they&rsquo;ll stop a car with elbows and Vogues because they know the young men will have guns,&rdquo; Quanell X said.</p>
<p>Not even sure where to start breaking this one down, wow.</p>
<p>Is he advocating profiling?  Is he telling them not to profile?  Is he as a black man saying, I dare ya, but it would be thrown out because of profiling?  Is he boasting about how the cops know who to look for, but are hand-cuffed because of profiling?  </p>
<p>Someone could tell these people that you can&rsquo;t blame others for your plight when you kill for RIMS.  If the one giving advice was black, he&rsquo;d be an Uncle Tom.  If he was White he&rsquo;d be a racist.</p>

		<p>I put artillery wheels - blacks don&rsquo;t want &#8216;em - on the 1931 Model-A, but our other two cars are Saturns - a 1995 and a 2002, both SL-2 sedans - with steel rims and plastic wheel covers.  Nobody ever got murdered over those.</p>
<p>One of our (white) neighbors did the bling rims thing, though, on a vintage black cadillac.  It wouldn&rsquo;t suprise me of some diversitoids ended up shooting him over that car.  I&rsquo;ll excuse him because of his age, but he&rsquo;ll be just as dead.</p>

		<p>Few things scream &#8220;profile me&#8221; like a Magenta or Chartreuse Chevy Impala with 20 inch spinner rims traveling down the road. Gee, I thought these people were the poor and downtrodden. I guess thousands of dollars to rebuild a junker into a fine ride is not a problem, especially with our tax dollars. </p>

		<p>Reminds me of the mask craze of a few years ago. The youffs in Cleveland would walk around with ski googles on their foreheads as if they were preparing to go off a ski jump.</p>

<p>Thanks for asking the most obvious question.  My guess is that he was a drug dealer, and that is probably one of the real reasons why he was murdered, in spite of what the article says   &mdash;   he probably impeded on the &#8220;turf&#8221; of one of his rivals in the &#8220;business,&#8221; smoked him, and took his chrome spinners to create the &#8220;robbery&#8221; motive to throw the cops.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thanks to how high car insurance and gas is getting, it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder for honest 17-year olds to drive and own cars legitimately.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the article a few weeks ago about the feds wanting to get the &#8216;hood wired up with high-speed internet service. I was thinking about that after reading the article, and I came up with a good reason to subsidize &#8216;net access: With all the money dem bros have to spend on drugs, ho&rsquo;s, rims, cars, gas, designer clothes and shoes, bling, fancy cell phones, etc., it&rsquo;s no wonder they have no money left for internet access.</p>
<p>Then again, some things are known as &#8220;priorities&#8221; in the white world.</p>

<p>Of course they need free internet, so they can organize hate mobs on Twitter, just like they did in Philly and KC.  You can&rsquo;t expect THEM to pay for their own ISP in order to access Twitter, do you?  You racist you.</p>

<p>Seriously, they can already text and use Twitter and Facebook on cell phones these days, so there&rsquo;s no need to be &#8220;wired&#8221; at home. The whole &#8220;free internet&#8221; thing is just another giveaway to transfer wealth from whites and pacify blacks (if that is possible).</p>
