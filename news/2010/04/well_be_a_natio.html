<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE Australian-born family will become a minority group within 15 years  &mdash;  outnumbered by a surging wave of migrants from Europe and Asia. </p>
<p>Figures from demographic consultants Macroplan Australia show record overseas migration and an ageing population mean migrant families will overtake the number of locally born residents by 2025  &mdash;  far sooner than previously imagined.</p>
<p>The news will infuriate some Australian citizens, who claim the population is already too big and infrastucture is buckling under the strain.</p>
<p>According to 2006 census data, 40 per cent of the nation&rsquo;s population was either born overseas or had at least one parent who was born abroad.</p>
<p>But at present immigration levels, that proportion will jump to more than 50 per cent by 2025.</p>
<p>The news comes a few days after the appointment of Tony Burke as Australia&rsquo;s first population minister</p>
<p>He faces the task of managing the influx of migrants, which is expected to swell the population from 22 million today to 36 million by 2050.</p>
<p>As Mr Burke was sworn in, a survey of 3000 people revealed 70 per cent of Australians do not want a bigger population. Fewer than a quarter favoured immigration as the main contributor.</p>
<p>But experts say a migrant majority will be healthy for Australian culture and attitudes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all adds to the cosmopolitan nature of modern Australia,&#8221; KPMG demographer Bernard Salt said. &#8220;It means our views become less blinkered, and we become more tolerant, confident, engaged, opportunistic and optimistic because we are open to new ideas, not obsessed with keeping things the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macroplan chief executive Brian Haratsis said Australians tended to &#8220;stare at our shoes and say we&rsquo;re the best in the world&#8221;.</p>
<p> &#8220;While immigration needs to be managed with better infrastructure, we also need high immigration for sound economic reasons  &mdash;  if we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll all end up paying higher taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Bob Birrell, co-director of the Centre for Population and Urban Research and reader in sociology at Monash University, said the ratio of foreign-born residents was already higher in Sydney and Melbourne because they were the two most popular destinations for new arrivals.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re getting lots more Indian and Chinese immigrants coming to study, but many of those will end up settling here,&#8221; Dr Birrell said.</p>
<p>The Federal Government estimates that cutting immigration from 280,000 to its target of 180,000 will result in a population of 36 million by 2050.</p>
<p>But it also means the number of working taxpayers will halve in relation to the number of people aged over 65.</p>
<p>Most migrants come from Britain (14.2 per cent), followed by New Zealand (11.4 per cent), India (11.2), China (10.5) South Africa (5.3) and the Philippines (4.1).</p>
<p>Mr Salt said there would be more Iraqi and Afghan migrants.<br>

		<p>Immigration has never been about a brain drain, ageing population or even tax revenue.  It&rsquo;s about replacing White People pure and simple and they will succeed too.  There is Poetic Justice to be had though, as the non-whites continue to grow in number, so will their demands and Seats in Power until finally, the White Traitors are eaten alive by the very ones they helped bring here and then the non-whites will continue on with their destruction until nothing at all is left.  Not even them.  </p>

<p>One of the dumbest statements I&rsquo;ve heard. How is a foreign majority going to be good for Australians? Would making China a majority of non-Chinese or Mexico  a majority of non-Mexicans be good for those countries. All a majority of non-Australians will do is make Australia cease to exist.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;While immigration needs to be managed with better infrastructure, we also need high immigration [from the Third World] for sound economic reasons &mdash; if we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll all end up paying higher taxes.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is Third World immigration always the answer to a decline in birth rates? Certainly, there are much better solutions. Just create incentives for young couples to procreate. Give tax breaks to couples that have three or more children. Increase those tax breaks for every additional child they have.</p>
<p>If immigration is needed as bad as they say it is, use national origin quotas. Britain, the USA, Canada, Germany, France, etc. should be the only countries that immigrants can come from. Exclude India, Botswana, Mexico, China, etc.</p>

		<p>Whatever happened to intellectual integrity? These experts give fabulous reasons for more immigration knowing full well that it&rsquo;d be almost impossible for the government to acknowledge that immigration has been a mistake. Can you imagine the government admitting that Asian and African immigrants cause more problems than benefits? So next time, these experts should spare us their phony reasoning and just tell us to accept more demographic change &hellip; or else!</p>
<p>Western countries used to have a debating tradition. Often the debaters wouldn&rsquo;t know which side of a resolution they would be arguing for. Such debating is valuable because it recognizes that knowledge and public opinion can become stagnant without constant vigilance and testing. We need more debating about immigration. We need to force these experts to debate sometimes for the opposing side - for the sake of intellectual integrity.<br>

		<p>One month ago, Dr. Bob Birrel, the director of Australian population research, boldly raised the alarms, warning, </p>
<p>&#8220;the predicted population of 35 million by 2050 would be a disaster for urban living and the environment.</p>
<p>Dr. Birrel went on to say, </p>
<p>&#8220;people from non-English speaking backgrounds are transforming Australia&#8221;, and common culture and heritage are at risk.</p>
<p>One month later, the mainstream propaganda press has fired back, using unknown &#8216;experts&rsquo; and &#8216;consultants&rsquo; to express that immigration is a fait accompli and an economic necessity. </p>
<p>Poor Dr. Birrel is relegated to an inferior status below the PR men, and his quotes and research reduced to selective, neutral facts.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The news will infuriate some Australian citizens, who claim the population is already too big and infrastructure is buckling under the strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another, &ldquo;go figure&rdquo; article with mocking assumptions.</p>
<p>Australia, might be a large country, however it is not one universally hospitable to billions of humans living in it. Or put another way, geography and climate both dictate that civilization as we know it, is concentrated on the costal areas. With that said, the carrying capacity is probably around only 25 million to 32 million people, tops; this is when you are only considering nonracial factors.</p>
<p>Enter the &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; nonsense regarding &ldquo;cosmopolitan&rdquo; constructs, and one indulges in the normal kaleidoscopic quagmire of stupidity. A stupidity, that is 0 proof &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and 200 proof treason.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p><br>
Lies, lies and even more lies!<br>
Did it come into the chief executive&rsquo;s mind that the improvement in infrastructure plus various other costs for school, medicare etc. requires higher taxes that will be just offset by immigrants&rsquo; income tax revenues in the best case, if not actually surpassed - depending on the productivity of the migrants? (Which is non-existent for e.g. Afghans). Also, suppose you have this gigantic mass of 3rd world immigrants who lack English proficiency, what jobs are you going to give them at a time when only the most competitive individuals have a chance of finding a decent job?  And what will happen in a recession?  Either the nanny-state will be raped of its budget due to welfare, or there will be serious conflict.</p>

		<p>Another example of the lunacy of Western leaders. How many times have I read of the severe shortages of fresh water in Austrailia?<br>
Furthermore, it is always Western liberals that babble on endlessly about how conservatives are negligent of environmental damage,etc. &#8220;Lunacy,&#8221; or maybe outright &#8220;evil&#8221;, are the two operative words for the way these people govern.</p>

		<p>Nice to see some well-reasoned posts, and not just the usual suspects telling us the Asian migration is harmless for us.</p>
<p>John PM is correct. We simply don&rsquo;t have room for too many more people. Least of all not in our major cities which were never designed to hold large populations and are already showing major strain, but also not in other areas, the build-up of which we&rsquo;re now being sold as some sort of an inevitability. I suppose it goes without saying that we&rsquo;re stuck with the same useless one-headed, two-party system that serves a few select interests but otherwise does nothing for the average white Australian.</p>
<p>The one thing that gives some hope is that one can sense an air of discontentment out there. An environment conducive for a new political movement to start. If that doesn&rsquo;t happen in the next 5 years or so, I don&rsquo;t know if it ever will. Nothing will happen overnight anyway, but we need a start somewhere.</p>

<p>As far as immigration and population growth being in themselves economically beneficial, the assertion is a nonsense. Many of these third world migrants will never pay net tax or make productivity contributions above their consumption. They may provide low skilled, cheap labour that benefits individual employers, but they will also make demands on the social service infrastructure in terms of education, health and housing. Because of the perversity of multiculturalism they will also make costly demands for their intrusive communities, both in terms of funding and social fragmentation. </p>
<p>So far as third world migrants making Australia more cosmopolitan goes, illiterate guerrilla soldiers and their offspring from Somalia and the Congo, or mad mullahs from Afghanistan and Iraq bring no sophistication I can see.</p>
<p>Of course, Gardner glibly overlooks difference between the high culture brought to Australia by the self-sufficient Europeans, and the whining bellyaching brought by the rest. </p>
<p>It was good to see Bob Birrell coming in on the right side of the debate, but he has been a part of the problem for a long time. It seems Prime Minister Rudd&rsquo;s lunacy has pushed Birrell to the verge of sanity, though Gardiner overlooks Birrell&rsquo;s views on the dangers of immigration.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism and the end of the White Australia Policy was just part of a programme that can be traced back to Lyndon Johnson, who brought in an Immigration Reform Act in 1965. Australia was more easily coerced than other western countries because we were allies of the US in Vietnam. Australia might not have opened its borders except for the Vietnam War. Gough Whitlam was opposed to Indochinese boat people, calling them Vietnamese Balts. </p>
<p>Since then, the Western world has been hoodwinked by half-baked arguments about demography and low birth rates, as even the third world waves of unskilled migrants will willingly pay taxes for pensions for aged Europeans. It&rsquo;s very rare to see these people, visible ethnic minorities, doing any volunteer work or work community services. </p>
<p>But it probably is not possible to reverse immigration trends without support from the larger governments of Europe and North America. The same laws and policies are enforced in all wealthy countries, as if there is a collective will to self-destruct. This may be the year, 2010, when the number of children born to minorities in the US is greater than those born to Americans of European heritage. </p>
<p>Luckily, more and more saner voices are being heard. Hopefully it is not yet too late.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;It all adds to the cosmopolitan nature of modern Australia,&rdquo; KPMG demographer Bernard Salt said. &ldquo;It means our views become less blinkered, and we become more tolerant, confident, engaged, opportunistic and optimistic because we are open to new ideas, not obsessed with keeping things the same.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Has it not been documented that multiculturalism does the exact opposite?  Even going as far as to make the native population distrust each other?   Or did I just dream I read that somewhere?</p>
<p><br>
This, my friends, is the reason I&rsquo;ve gone from being a authoritarian in my late teens and early 20&rsquo;s to a radical decentralization-ist by now (about to be 33).  </p>
<p>I am so tired of this we need immigrants to prop up the system argument.  The sad thing is there is some truth to this.  That is why I oppose socialism in all its forms (yes I would even end public schooling).   </p>
<p>Not that I know much about Australia, but I would bet that they have some sort of social security/nationalized health care program like every other western country.  These programs and the prices that families have to pay for to receive them always make children an economic burden for the very people who should be having children, namely the middle class.  </p>
<p>Because social security and the rest of these programs are Ponzi schemes.  You need more people paying in than you can have taking out. You compare that with the economic incentive not to reproduce and you almost always get this problem where we (western nations) have to import cheap labor from other countries. Whether that will fix the problem is another debate (I would ask when has the government ever fixed anything, so you know where I stand on that debate).</p>
<p>Also lets not forget the double whammy of socialism.  While increasing the cost of life to middle class families, it subsidizes the poor to procreate more frequently, and now even subsidizes the poor of other countries to set up businesses at cheaper prices than it would cost the indigenous in our own countries. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe, like someone said before me, that is a conspiracy to wipe out the European race by the elites.  The power elites are addicted to power, and they would flood Australia, Britain, or America with Martians if they thought they would gain more power from having them here.  They understand that a polyglot society creates tons of more reasons for the government to stick their nose into our business, thus fueling the growth of government.  A politician isn&rsquo;t to far from CEO in this respect.  Growth of the government is to the politician like the growth of the company is for the CEO.</p>
<p>As I said, I now blame almost all our ills on the government.  It is our governments that have waged war against the native born populations (brings to mind the famous Bertold Brecht comment about dissolving the people and electing a new one).  It is the government that taxes you through the nose, thus making it expensive to have a big family.  It is the government that takes the few kids you have and sends them to a &#8220;public (government) school&#8221; and feels their heads full of hate for their people&rsquo;s pasts while singing the praises of the government.  It is the government through their war on drugs encourages drug use at their open-air drug markets (public schools) while glamorizing the &#8220;Gangsta&#8221; culture which encourages you daughter to sleep with them, and its the government that allows your daughter to get an abortion without your knowledge, although the same kid at the same age can&rsquo;t buy tobacco.  It is the government who refuses to close the borders, so that that house you bought on money that had been taxed 10 times before you spent it price decreases as your neighborhood changes before you eyes.  And then when you get older it is the government who gives you pennies on the dollar for the money you paid into the system.  As I was reading on Alternativeright.com how long will it be before they start using &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; to determine who gets health care?  Sorry Mr. Middle-Class-White-Guy-Who-Played-The-Game we have to deny you certain treatments because Tyrone who never payed into the system and abused his body might die earlier than you and that would mean that there is racism in the system.  </p>
<p>Starting in the beginning of the last century the Western World erected a new idol, a new golden calf, and this idol has led us astray.  Namely the idolatry of the state.  When western and especially English speaking people stood astride the world we were mostly free and independent.  Self reliance was the byword of the day.  Now most westerners are afraid to cross the street without some politician telling the appropriate method, manner, and time to do it.  </p>
<p>It is time to renounce the idolatry of the State.  </p>
<p>But I fear this won&rsquo;t happen.  All western countries have become the proverbial Germany that Lenin made fun of with his comment stating if there was going to be a strike at the railroad station they would all line up and buy tickets first.</p>

		<p>&#8221;,,,having migrants will make us more tolerant,,,&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only untrue but the exact opposite of the truth.</p>
<p>&#8221;,,,shows we are not obsessed with keeping things the same,,&#8221;</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s wrong with keeping things the same? Australia was/is a fine country. It ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.</p>

		<p>Evey Australian knows that the post-1975 influx of Muslim Lebanese - by and large, the Christian Lebanese have been assets - has been catastrophic.</p>
<p>https://www.australian-news.com.au/Ethnic_crime_African.htm</p>
<p>Now the Australian political class is eager to import tens of thousands of Africans from Somalia and Sudan as well as Afghans and Iraqis.</p>
<p>Greg Deane&rsquo;s correct memory about Gough Whitlam expressing the view that the Sino-Vietnamese fleeing the aftermath of the Indochinese war would be &#8220;like more f  &mdash;  -ing Balts&#8221; needs a word of explanation; the &#8220;Balts&#8221; - from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - formed a resolutely anti-Communist voting bloc in their new country and were strongly resistant to the blandishments and promises of leftist parties.</p>

		<p><i>But experts say a migrant majority will be healthy for Australian culture and attitudes.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It all adds to the cosmopolitan nature of modern Australia,&rdquo; KPMG demographer Bernard Salt said. &ldquo;It means our views become less blinkered, and we become more tolerant, confident, engaged, opportunistic and optimistic because we are open to new ideas, not obsessed with keeping things the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brink in a bunch of marauding Muslim&hellip;er &#8220;Asian&#8221;&hellip;&#8221;yutes&#8221; raping and stealing to show you what &#8220;tolerance&#8221; is all about. Yeah, that&rsquo;s the ticket!</p>
<p>Seriously, I am getting an education here from all the great comments, especially the ones I have read over the past nine months or so, since finding AmRen, about the race replacement of whites around the world and how every race, I mean EVERY race is entitled to their homeland(s) but whites. Reading about it makes me sad at times, angry at others, and I would definitely support any politician that would try to restrict and reform (ala no more third-world immigrants) immigration, both legal and illegal, here in the US.</p>

		<p>It would be interesting to know the cost to Australia per Third World immigrant.</p>
<p>Many of the Vietnamese in Australia are fine and industrious people but Australia, like the USA, now has Vietnamese gangs.</p>
<p>Here are some figures from France:</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation about the &#8220;Balts&#8221;.  It made no sense on the face of it as they are beautiful, courageous and very sophisticated tribes.  Indeed, the world could stand many more of them which is probably why Lenin and Stalin did what htey could do to kill them all.</p>
