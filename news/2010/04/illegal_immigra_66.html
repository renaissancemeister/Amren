			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead, Telegraph (London), April 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sukdarshan Singh, an Indian, arrived in Britain unlawfully in 1984 and raped a 59-year-old woman four years later. </p>
<p>He was only linked to the attack in 2006 after being arrested for drink driving and was jailed for four and a half years. </p>
<p>An immigration tribunal ruled he should be deported but the Court of Appeal yesterday overturned the decision because it had failed to take in to account his rights to family life as he now has a British wife and two teenage children. </p>
<p>In 1998, Singh, 55, raped a woman in Bridgend, Wales, where he had a market stall. </p>
<p>He later married in 1991 and his wife did not know about the crime until 2006 when he was arrested for driving with excess alcohol and DNA evidence linked him to the rape. </p>
<p>He was sentenced to four years six months jail at Cardiff Crown Court and his application for indefinite leave to remain in the UK was refused in 2008 because of his rape conviction. </p>
<p>Yesterday, he was appealing against the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) finding which upheld the decision of the Home Secretary to return him to India. </p>
<p>But Lord Justice Aikens said the &#8220;overall question&#8221; in the case was whether deportation would be a disproportionate interference with his private and family life protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. </p>
<p>He said the AIT had concluded that if family life was to continue, Mr Singh&rsquo;s wife and children, who are all British citizens, would also have to go to India. </p>
<p>But the tribunal had not considered the effect of the move on the two children, who had lived all their lives in the UK and this was an error of law, the judge said. </p>
<p>He said the AIT should have balanced the threat of family breakdown, the effect on the children and feasibility of a move to India with the aim of deportation in protecting the public. </p>
<p>&#8220;I am not convinced that when the balance is struck it would inevitably be on the side of deportation,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>He allowed the appeal and ordered that another tribunal should reconsider the case. <br/>

		<p>Mr. Singh is almost 60 years old.  His teenaged &#8216;children&rsquo; must be almost adults.  </p>
<p>British teenagers are fighting and dieing in Afghanistan far from their fathers.  This judge is applying a very soft approach to &#8216;family life&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Watch for this argument to be used more often in UK, and become popular here in the US.  We already have fools arguing that illegals should not be deported because their families are here.  What will probably happen is the UK wife divorces the rapist, but the appeals court allowed him to stay (and prey on somebody elderly again).<br/>

		<p>Send them all back to India, simple as that.</p>
<p>It is absolutely preposterous that they are even considering hearing an appeal! What is the point in collecting any evidence if no one gets punished for the crimes! Why not just open the doors to the prisons and dismantle the justice system right now if they are so worried about &#8220;interfering with the private and family life&#8221; of criminals? The UK will die an agonizing death by its own political correctness&hellip;</p>

		<p><i>But Lord Justice Aikens said the &ldquo;overall question&rdquo; in the case was whether deportation would be a <b>disproportionate interference</b> with his <b>private</b> and <b>family life</b> protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.</i></p>
<p>Yes, the rapist who violated the <b>privacy</b> of his victims and the resulting trauma they experienced which <b>disproportionately interfered</b> with their <b>family lives</b>. The lives of the women he raped have been eternally marred, let alone suffering a &#8220;disproportionate interference&#8221; which that deranged judge thinks is so important to the rapist (of all people). The rapist doesn&rsquo;t deserve the right to privacy anymore, and his family life should be interfered with. In other words, he should be forced to wear a shirt that says &#8220;I AM A RAPIST&#8221; for the rest of his life and his kin should completely disown him.</p>
<p>Now you see the repercussions that political correctness has had on the judicial system in Western countries.</p>

<p>Hmmm…?</p>
<p>Is Comrade Lord Justice Aikens, inferring that India is somehow inferior to the UK? If so isn&rsquo;t that racist?</p>
<p>India after all, is full of Indians and should be considered a very welcoming place to the rapist and his family. As we all know, India soon will be a superpower and colonizing Mars via their superior technology; therefore, should not the rapist Singh find this a better alternative to the backward and declining UK, which teams with racism and ignorance.</p>
<p>Indeed, Comrade Lord Justice Aikens seems to prove this and wishes to punish this man with an unusual cruelty that is dedicated endlessly subjecting the rapist Singh to British intolerance and barbarism.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all and may he also bless the BNP with an unprecedented victory this year!</p>

		<p>Married in 1991.  His kids could be any age from infant to 19.</p>
<p>This argument was used in San Francisco as early as 1960.  I remember a C. American woman who had 3 kids in foster homes because of her abuse.  She was a career criminal.  When she got out of state prison she was allowed to stay because of her children in the foster homes.  She and the kids were all illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Sob sob said the social workers.  We can&rsquo;t send the kids back to Guatamala I believe was the country. It is so uncivilized and primitive.  No welfare system to give them free food.</p>
<p>So they all stayed.</p>
<p>Ironically, there are no White social workers left in the public sector.  They snivelled and whined and helped with diversity and bring in the non White immigrant job thieves and did themselves out of jobs.</p>

		<p>*Whoops, four years later thus 1988.  Still confusing though.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1998, Singh, 55, raped a woman in Bridgend, Wales, where he had a market stall.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>1998</b> is a mistake (or typo) in the Telegraph&rsquo;s article. It <b>should</b> be <b>1988</b>.</p>
<p>Other than that, anybody remember when Western Civilization was still Western Civilization? I feel sorry for young(er) people, who don&rsquo;t know what it was like.</p>

		<p>Mr. Singh should still be deported. If his family loves him so much that they can&rsquo;t bear separation they&rsquo;ll follow him to India. Somehow I doubt they would. For all we hear about the urgent need for &#8220;family reunification&#8221; it only happens in one direction - from the Rest to the West. If people don&rsquo;t want to be separated from their families they shouldn&rsquo;t come here to begin with.</p>

		<p>Keep in my mind that as I write this the polls in the UK show Conservatives with 33% support, Liberal Dems with 30%, and Labour with 29%. According to one story if the results were as such, that would mean a Labour/Liberal Dem coalition with 374 seats v. 245 for Conservatives.</p>
<p>Britain has gone completely mad.</p>

		<p>What kind of family life did they have during the 4 years he was in prison?  And why can&rsquo;t the wife stay in the UK with the kids while they finish high school, and then she can join her husband in India, while the children, upon reaching adulthood, can choose either location?  </p>
<p>MANY families live in two locations for one or two years when Dad gets a new job, but kids want to finish high school in their home town.  In Japan, the mother almost always stays put with the kids in the old city when dad gets transferred to a new city.  Apparently, being the &#8220;new kid&#8221; at school in Japan is so horrible that parents will not put their children through it.</p>
<p>This guy was in his early 30s when he committed the rape.  He is a Bad Apple.  Get rid of him.  Don&rsquo;t let him sit on his ass in Britain and collect a pension and medical benefits.  I wonder how much he paid in taxes from his &#8220;stall.&#8221;  Not much, I&rsquo;ll bet.</p>

		<p>What about the family lives of the women he attacked?  Aren&rsquo;t the victims important?  Guess not.</p>
<p>One of the things that keeps a society civilized is knowing that your activities will have an effect, good or bad, on your family.  Before committing a crime a person must think how will this act affect his wife, children, parents, etc..  His wife and children should suffer the negative consequence of his absence.  And it must be stressed that his absence is entirely HIS fault.  He committed a heinous crime.  End of discussion.  </p>
<p>If he is so jim-dandy let them follow him back to India.</p>
<p>When you reduce the negative consequences of a criminal act you only invite more of that activity.<br/>
