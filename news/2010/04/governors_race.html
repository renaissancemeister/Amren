<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/apr/12/governors-race-could-be-about-illegals/">Governor&rsquo;s Race Could Be About Illegals</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valerie Richardson, Washington Times, April 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thirteen years after a federal judge struck down California&rsquo;s Proposition 187, the 1994 initiative banning social services for illegal immigrants, the measure has resurfaced as a top issue in the state&rsquo;s Republican gubernatorial primary.</p>
<p>State insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner has used his support for the initiative to position himself as the stronger candidate on border security, emphasizing that he backed Proposition 187  &mdash;  while his chief rival, former eBay Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman, did not.</p>
<p>During a March 15 debate, he called for cutting off &#8220;taxpayer-funded benefits for people who are here illegally. Meg doesn&rsquo;t want to go that far. I support Prop. 187  &mdash;  she opposes it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Whitman has said that she wouldn&rsquo;t have voted for Proposition 187 due to concerns over removing children from the public education and health care system. {snip}</p>
<p>Even so, it&rsquo;s Mrs. Whitman who is drawing the wrath of Hispanic activists. Her decision to name former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson as her campaign chairman has inflamed Hispanic groups that still view the former governor as the face of the anti-illegal immigration movement.</p>
<p>During the 1994 campaign, Mr. Wilson was the most prominent supporter of Proposition 187, which passed with 59 percent of the vote. {snip}</p>
<p>While Proposition 187 was never enacted, it became a rallying cry for Hispanic activists and was credited with triggering a jump in Democratic voter registration. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His role in the Whitman campaign suggests that &#8220;she&rsquo;s either completely tone-deaf or she&rsquo;s decided she doesn&rsquo;t need Latinos to win the primary or the general election,&#8221; Mr. Vargas said. {snip}</p>
<p>Given that one in three Californians is now Hispanic, he said, the Republican candidates may have miscalculated by placing so much emphasis on illegal immigration. But, at the same time, the issue remains crucial to conservative Republicans who dominate primary elections, not to mention the &#8220;tea party&#8221; activists now swelling Republican ranks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}. A group called the Democratic Governors Association Non-Candidate Committee has launched a YouTube video and Web site calling for his [Wilson&rsquo;s] removal.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Meg Whitman wants to earn the trust of California&rsquo;s Latinos, the right thing for her to do is send Pete Wilson packing,&#8221; says the ad.</p>

		<p>Who cares? Most Latinos don&rsquo;t bother voting in CA, anyway. And the ones who do are probably sick of the population pressure due to their low caste, illegal alien brethren. So, if Meg were smart she would praise Prop 187 and vow to send the AG to court to enact it if she is made Governor. She should ignore Hispanic activists whose power grows the more warm brown bodies get stuffed into the Central Valley.</p>

		<p>If Poizner does win the primary and goes on to beat jerry brown in the general election this may very well be California&rsquo;s last chance to say itself from complete destruction by the third-world hoards. Because the former &#8216;golden&rsquo; state is running out of money fast and could very well turn into America&rsquo;s first &#8220;failed state.&#8221; Sad how one of the world&rsquo;s most desirable place to live has been so ruined, the immigrant invasion being the central reason for this epic downfall.</p>

		<p>As a CA resident, for me the choice is between Whitman and Poizner.  I like Poizner&rsquo;s conservatism, but I also like Whitman&rsquo;s impressive resume of business experience.  We need someone who is an expert problem-solver, especially in the area of money, in CA as governor, and Whitman definitely qualifies.  But, she is not conservative enough for me, since she supports welfare money for illegals.  Wilson was hired to win over some more conservative votes for Whitman.  All the Mexicans will vote for Jerry Brown anyway, so Republicans can pretty well write them off.  I have not made up my mind yet.  I am going to have to study these candidates carefully and watch what each says in the coming weeks before the election.  My guess is a lot of CA residents feel the same way.</p>

<p>Let me help you with your choice.  I wouldn&rsquo;t touch Meg Whitman with a ten-foot pole, even in the General election.  The reason is that she loves those H-1B visas.  </p>
<p>Her time as CEO of E-Bay wasn&rsquo;t that great, from what I understand.  She just happened to be at the helm during the dot-com boom and bust.  She might have done some good things, but I don&rsquo;t think she was as brilliant as some would think.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other problem.  She&rsquo;s a former CEO.  She expects the executive branch of state government to be just like another business, she would expect that her every demand be instantly obeyed.  First off, there are two other branches of government.  Second, even though the executive branch has a Weberian power structure on paper like a business, the military or the police, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way in practice.  Backs have to be scratched, palms have to be greased and logs have to be rolled just to get things done with in an executive branch of government.  And that&rsquo;s not counting the legislature or the courts.</p>
<p>Carly Fiorina is another one, she wants Barbara Boxer&rsquo;s job.  I affectionately call her Carly H-1Borina.</p>

		<p>Poizner&rsquo;s the only reasonable option, but it will come down to a race between moonbeam and the cretin who couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to vote until she decided she had political aspirations of her own. </p>
<p>In the meantime I continue to save my pennies to leave this lost state. </p>

		<p>Meg Whitman is certainly well-qualified to be governor in most ways but, like most establishment-approved, pro-business candidates, she is not a culture warrior, inlcuding on illegal immigration. Unfortunately a conservative culture warrior is just what the country needs right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad.</p>
<p><b>We need someone who is an expert problem-solver, especially in the area of money</b></p>
<p>See my point above. In order to take on the budget crisis you have to look at the budget with the eye of someone who&rsquo;s conservative in every respect, and who&rsquo;s willing to take on the Left on every issue. It takes more than a bean counter to solve this crisis. Were I a Californian I would vote for Whitman, if she got the GOP nod, and I would hope for the best - but I wouldn&rsquo;t bet the farm.</p>

		<p>#3 SoCARealist, I know what you mean about Whitman, but I wouldn&rsquo;t vote for her in a thousand years. She can have all the expertise she claims, where knowledge of how to run a business is concerned,etc. but running a state is not like running a business. It is impossible to fix Californias financial situation, when billions are spendt on illegal aliens and their kids, with NO END IN SIGHT. Whitman won&rsquo;t even mention stopping illegal immigration into California, let alone, deporting illegal foreign nationals. </p>
<p>Poisner on the other hand says he will take away the massive benefits illegal aliens receive, but I don&rsquo;t believe him. He will do nothing if voted in. But I&rsquo;d still vote for Poisner. Why? Because at least he is willing to talk about the damage illegal aliens do to the state, and that qualifies him in my opinion, just for being brave enough to mention it. Sounds like a crazy reason to base ones vote on?? Of course it&rsquo;s crazy. But it&rsquo;s also a symtom of the desperation of most Californians, looking for someone, anyone, to STOP THE MASSIVE INVASION BY A FOREIGN NATIONS,LARGELY IGNORANT POPULACE, THAT&rsquo;S DESTROYING CALIFORNIA.</p>

		<p>Yes, #8 Bobby, we have been invaded by SEVERAL foreign nations (check the Asians in Monterey Park and Alhambra, and the folks over by Glendale and LaCrescenta, the Armenians - and of course all the Hispanics from various countries, Mexico being the most represented.)  If Poisner (now you know some droll leftwinger is going to make a play on that name, as in &#8220;Poisoner&#8221;) - is at least willing to try to stop the illegal immigration, I&rsquo;m for him.  I don&rsquo;t know if the Legislature will allow it though.  So a lot of Dems need to be booted out of Sacto and conservatives replacing them - that way Poisner would have a chance.  </p>

		<p>#9 SoCalRealist, thank you for pointing out the other illegal aliens besides those from Mexico,etc. I guess we get caught up focusing on the Mexicans because there are so many. But you&rsquo;re right. There are hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens from all the other groups you mentioned, and so many of them are involved in every scam under the sun. Oh, how racist some progressive will say. Not if stating what you continually read in the paper and see on TV is being racist. Some of these illegal aliens are not &#8220;progressing&#8221; us in any way imaginable.</p>
