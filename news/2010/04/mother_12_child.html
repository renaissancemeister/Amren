<h1>Mother, 12 Children Leave Motel for New Home</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Keith Morelli, Tampa Tribune, April 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The din of room 168 at the Economy Inn on East Busch Boulevard occasionally drowned out conversation.</p>
<p>Twelve children ranging from teenagers to toddlers to infants spent the past week here, scrambling across the floor, bouncing on beds. With eyes filled with resignation on Wednesday morning, they were hungry and dirty and they wore the same clothes as the day before and the day before that.</p>
<p>Angel Adams, the mom, was asking for help, as the children rambled about the room. She was homeless and hopeless, she said. A relative paid for the motel room for a week, and after that, who knows. Her fiancé is in prison. Her 1-year-old is named John The Baptist Brown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nick Cox, regional director of the Florida Department of Children and Families, paid Adams a visit and, standing outside the motel room with all 12 children present, offered a solution. He said there was room at A Kid&rsquo;s Place in Brandon, a cottage large enough to house a family of 12. Wary of the offer, Adams agreed.</p>
<p>The lifelong Tampa resident said she wants justice from the Hillsborough County sheriff&rsquo;s child protection team that took her kids away from her two years ago and from Hillsborough Kids Inc., which got her kids back six months ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others would disagree, saying Adams is the cause of her own problems.</p>
<p>This morning, inside the dingy motel room, Adams handed out a list of her children&rsquo;s names and ages. Across the top: &#8220;Three fathers. One Mother. Fifteen Children.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 12 kids are the youngest of 15 altogether, she said. Three have &#8220;aged out,&#8221; meaning they have turned 18 and are on their own, no longer a part of the child welfare system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hillsborough Kids agreed to pay the $800 a month rent after caseworkers inspected the apartment and, though a bit cramped, said it was OK.</p>
<p>But the landlord, who evicted Adams in March, thought differently.</p>
<p>Sandy Chiellini said Adams showed up to sign the lease with Brown [Garry Brown, father of 10 of the children] and one child. She didn&rsquo;t learn until later that there were 11 other children. There were problems with plumbing, downstairs tenants were flooded. There was noise, and occasional visits from police. Other tenants were complaining. Some left.</p>
<p>She said Adams&rsquo; apartment was trashed. Clothes and food were scattered everywhere, screens were broken out. Chiellini began eviction proceedings. Adams failed to show up for two eviction hearings.</p>
<p>Chiellini said Adams and her children left last Thursday, taking only the clothes on their backs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, Adams was hesitant. She wanted to know about the long term.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need money,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I need transportation. My children need a place to live.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is why there will be few Whites in America 100 years from now.  Note also that our current wealth-redistribution system (i.e., taxes) forces Whites to pay for their own displacement, and the current PC philosophy forces Whites to celebrate and cheer with joy at their eventual genocide.  </p>

		<p>While poverty isn&rsquo;t a crime, activity such as this should be considered criminal.  As for White displacement in America, it will be more the result of immigration combined with a low White birth rate than it will be due to situations such as the one portrayed in this article.</p>

<p>This is really tragic.  There is no way this woman should have even one kid.  The ones she has brought into this world are not going to have the intelligence to learn anything, which means they&rsquo;ll be in and out of jail their entire lives.</p>
<p>All their lives would be much better if they were living in a tribal setting in a village in Africa where every one of these kids would be pre-occupied with tribal customs and duties, living outside away from the confines of a concrete jungle with nothing to do but smoke dope, sell it, or steal and rob to make a living.</p>
<p>Civilization has been the greatest enemy most blacks have in the West today.  They belong in villages doing the tasks and maintaining the customs their ancestors have done for thousands of years.</p>

		<p>I really think there should be jail for this.  How is it this sort of reproductive behavior is tolerated?  The taxpayers are forced to support these children (as well as their Mother!) in one form or another; and rearing this many children without adequate supervision endangers the public.  How many ordinary citizens will utlimately be harmed by this woman&rsquo;s offspring?  And I would hold the &#8220;Fathers&#8221; equally responsible.  </p>
<p>Sickening.  And I hold this opinion apart from my views on race  &mdash;  though the racial consequences are obvious.</p>

<p>Just with our own eyes we can see Blacks are reproducing at an alarming rate and most are all on the welfare rolls thanks to Whities paying for their own displacement!</p>

		<p>Without question, the most tragic and ultimately socially  corrosive error this nation ever made was to allow black African slaves into this country.  And the second greatest error was not to have, as Abraham Lincoln wanted, return them them to the African continent.</p>
<p>Slavery was indeed a moral abomination.  Keeping the ex-slaves in a society and culture in which they had no place was an equal moral abomination.</p>

		<p>This story was also posted on FreeRepublic.com.  It quoted her as saying &#8220;I can have as many as I want to.&#8221;  Unfortunately, she can  &mdash;  at everyone else&rsquo;s expense.  What a stupid beeyotch.<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of ghetto behavior has trickled up to at least some whites.  I know of at least two white women who have have 4 or 5 kids, mostly with different fathers&hellip; one-woman breeding machines.  Totally disgusting. <p></p>
<p>Hey, I am not a fan of the Duggars (tribes just aren&rsquo;t my cup of tea), but at least the Duggars can afford to take care of however many they&rsquo;ve got now.  Quite different from these idiot welfare mommies. </p></p></p>

<p>Is there any better statement that shows the black attitude toward entitlement and lack of responsibility that the one above? What this woman needs is sterilization first and foremost, and then a mental exam to see why she thinks popping out 15 kids over about 20 years is a good idea.</p>

		<p>2) They also kill each other at far more than the white rate.  Though it would be interesting to see black on black murder and black on white murder statistics put next to eachother to see if that&rsquo;s a net gain or a net loss for our side.</p>

<p>Yes I absolutely believe these stats are accurate.  Not everything is a conspiracy.  Have you had any children recently?  If so, you would know the hospital is required to gather this information at birth.  The only way these numbers aren&rsquo;t accurate is if you believe these people are giving birth in barns.  Anyway, I think it&rsquo;s irrational to think there is some type of conspiracy.</p>
<p>I can also give you rational reasons you why their birth numbers have plummeted.  My theory is easy access to abortion, a rise in middle class blacks and a lack of black men (due to premature death and incarceration).<br>

		<p>the scariest thing about this story is that if this kind of black woman is having 15 children, then quite a few blacks are having none - to average out to 2 per pair: </p>
<p>this means that competent, educated black women are having practically no children, &amp; in 25 years, the average balck IQ will be much lower than it is today - and it is already  a disaster.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that the average IQ of the black birth mother was ca 75. </p>
<p>mild eugenic pressures (if not such a silly taboo) could correct this trend: </p>
<p>pay the low IQers to get sterlized after the 1st kid, subsidize the brighter ones to have familes.</p>
<p>truly hopeles is the ocean of mexicans flooding the country. </p>
<p>all we can do there is give mexico a few southern states, move the border, then close it up tighter than a drum.</p>

<p>Our society and economy would benefit, and taxes would go down if we actually paid each low-IQ person 1 million Dollars to be sterilized.  Likewise, Imagine the benefits if we paid each very-high IQ couple 1 million Dollars for each child they produced.  Imagine the scientific and technical advances we could make!  Imagine the quality of living and vigorous economy that would result.  </p>
<p>But in the USA, we don&rsquo;t actually want quality (= high standard of living); we want quantity (massive overpopulation). </p>

		<p>Stories like this just make my blood boil.  Reminds me of a black woman I saw on a talk show years ago.  She had about 10 or 12 children, all of them on the show with her.  She was complaining that her welfare payments weren&rsquo;t enough, that they should give her more, that she had a right to have as many kids as she wanted, etc.  Of course, some members of the audience disagreed.  So the woman lined up her brood all in a row, pointed to them and self-righteously said, &#8220;These is my kids.  Tell me which ones I should have kilt!&#8221;  These people don&rsquo;t &#8220;get it&#8221; and never will.  It&rsquo;s time to take children away from those who cannot or will not care for them, yet keep having more.  It&rsquo;s time to bring back orphanages.</p>

		<p>It seems that this article is cleaned up to make the mother seem more sympathetic, as her threatening to have more children which was contained in an earlier version of the story has mysteriously vanished.</p>
<p>Sadly this woman seems to be pumping out babies not out of love, or even for welfare hand outs but as a perverse act of revenge and spite toward the society that wronged her. </p>
<p>In all too typical black fashion she seethes with hatred towards the charities, social workers, and do gooders who are only trying their best to help her despite her obvious self destructive tendencies.</p>
<p>Her attitude is these people just need to shut their mouths, stop reporting on her neglect and should concentrate on buying her a nice house, a fly ride, and keeping her bank account filled with all the money that she is rightfully entitled to.</p>

		<p>22 Elitist: Rather than giving up a few of OUR southern states, we ought take a few of Mexico&rsquo;s northern provinces and with them create a buffer state.  Within the U.S. there are millions of semi-civilized Mexicans who have actually graduated from high school and know how to fix cars properly and so on.  There are also a small number of Mexicans here who are actually First World people.  Send these people to the new buffer state, and the gangs further south.  Tell the better sort that if they want to live as well as they did in the U.S. they will need to guard their southern border, unflinchingly.  I don&rsquo;t doubt that many of the better sort of people from other parts of Mexico would move to the new country too.  Give them some help to get them started, because we really want them to succeed.  We&rsquo;d be much better off with something resembling Chile on our border than what we have now. </p>

		<p>Good job.<br>
And if she isn&rsquo;t as rich as the white working woman, thats because of RACISM. <br>
And if her kids aren&rsquo;t as good as the twos kids of the white families it is RACISM.<br>
And if she hasn&rsquo;t a job, it is RACISM.<br>
And if government wants her to work it is RACISM.<br>
And if her Children get into jail it is RACISM.</p>
<p>And what happens if she wants to live in a van next to a white community and the community doesn&rsquo;t want that. <br>
What is it (drum roll). Of course it is because of the evil white racist.</p>

Now if by &#8220;educated&#8221; you mean has some bogus &#8220;African American Studies&#8221; degree and by &#8220;competent&#8221; you mean has an affirmative action government job somewhere and has managed to stay out of jail, then ok. </p>

		<p>Just for fun, let&rsquo;s assume that each of Angel&rsquo;s children have the same number of children as their mother, and that they start having kids from 16 years of age.</p>
<p>Angel&rsquo;s youngest child is one, so he or she would start reproducing in 15 years. By the time Angel&rsquo;s youngest child stops having children, in 30 years, Angel would have 225 grandchildren.</p>
<p>If we assume that the grandchildren also have offspring at the same rate as their parents, in another 15 years(45 years from now), Angel would be the proud great-grandparent of 3,375 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Assuming that all of Angel&rsquo;s children and her children&rsquo;s children go on government aid, and that each child receives 150 dollars per month from the government until the age of 18, the three generations work out to cost(12 months*18 yrs*150 dollars)*(15 children+225 grandchildren+3375 great grandchildren)=$117,126,000 in 2010 dollars over 45 years.</p>

		<p> My grandmother had 13 children   &mdash;   one more than &#8220;Angel&#8221; (ha!) Adams now has at home. But they were all fathered by my grandfather; who was married to my grandmother; and who supported his family. They were married at 18 and not quite 15, respectively, and stayed married nearly 60 years, until Grandpa&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p> What has happened to this world, when irresponsible adults procreate like rabbits as &#8220;Angel&#8221; and Garry Brown did   &mdash;   then expect the taxpayers to pick up the tab for them because they&rsquo;re &#8220;poor&#8221;?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Slavery was indeed a moral abomination. Keeping the ex-slaves in a society and culture in which they had no place was an equal moral abomination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even worse, those who learned to live decently, work hard, act responsibly, etc. have been VILIFIED while the lazy, NAACP-loving, Marxist, drug-dealing types have become role models.</p>
<p>When wrong becomes right and right becomes wrong, it all goes to pot.</p>
<p>P.S. Your young white relatives are starting to act the same way in case you haven&rsquo;t been paying attention. This is not race-specific behavior. It was all started in at least the 1920s.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for one moment those kids only have 3 fathers. Probably more like 6-8 fathers but why would the woman admit that? No one is going to check afterall and it isn&rsquo;t like she is collecting child support.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;This woman is rather monogamous. </p>
<p>Assuming that three is in fact the correct total (and who knows?), Angel Adams would be trigamous if she were married to all three of the men with whom she mated. </p>
<p>Since she evidently has had the 15 offspring without benefit of even one marriage, certain other old-fashioned terms would apply. </p>

		<p>Of course Whites don&rsquo;t have a problem with this. They&rsquo;ve been so feminized and brainwashed for the last 60 years that any man that comes out and criticizes this will immediately get shouted down by a blue eyed, slightly overweight young woman with a tank top and a short hair cut. Many Whites are just as worthless now.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen is the slow descent into Kurtagic&rsquo;s nightmare Mister scenario. Very, very few people will care, as the remaining whites on the planet will be content watching feetsball, movies, making love to their foreign blooded wives, and living among the swarthy hordes that think Lady Gaga is reasonable music. </p>
<p>Eventually, as Savitri Devi says, someone will have to make the decision to save the West, and by drastic measures. Even I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine what we&rsquo;ve lost compared to the European White civilization. America is far gone, the mentality of the people is one of coddling and patheticness, and there is nothing worth saving here. Europa, on the other hand, will sink ever so far, and then one day the decision will have to be made whether to chose the West or the modern world. And someone is going to have to make that decision.</p>

		<p>The difference between her and the Dugger family is that these kids have 2 MARRIED parents who support their children. Jim Bob Dugger is an entrepreneur who owns several commercial buildings that he rents out to businesses. The family makes their own soap and detergent and they shop at thrift stores. The girls do their perms and cut each others hair. Their home in Arkansas has only 3 bedrooms. The boys and girls live dormitory style with all the girls living in one bedroom and the boys the other. The family does not and never has received any type of public assistance and also, they are debt free. Amazing isn&rsquo;t it!</p>

		<p>Dear Post # 2:  Go into any hospital new-born unit and look at the number of Minority vs. White babies and then try to tell me that Whites will not be demographically removed from North America.  </p>
<p>In the town where I recently lived, the population was 28% Minority, but the newborns were 80% Minority. The same can be seen at most elementary schools in southern California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas   &mdash;   there you will see a majority of (in some cases 100%) minorities, even if the local community still has a majority White population.  The writing is on the wall, and unless we immediately stop the importation of millions of Third Worlders into the USA, White people will be exterminated from this continent.   </p>

		<p>To anon #39:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I understand the point of your post.  My post wasn&rsquo;t about immigration or future demographics.  I was simply stating there in no organic population growth among black Americans (with a current birth rate of 2.1, which isn&rsquo;t debatable).</p>
<p>Whites are definitely going to be a minority/majority group in the near future, but it isn&rsquo;t because of high birth rates among black women.  It&rsquo;s because of a porous border.</p>
