<h1>Open Season on Our Black Officials</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Stevenson, Hudson Valley Press, April 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By now we all know there won&rsquo;t be any US Senate run for Harold Ford Jr., not in New York anyway. {snip} Ford also revealed in an op-ed he wrote to the New York Times, that party insiders tried to &#8220;bully&#8221; him out of the race, citing they were &#8220;nervous&#8221; and wanted change.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I recall specific operations by the Federal Government to target black elected officials for probes. That&rsquo;s right, what we see Paterson going through, is very similar to what black elected officials have been going through in major cities like Buffalo, Philadelphia, Detroit, DC. Years ago investigations by Mary A. Fischer, Joe Davidson and Michael Frisby disclosed multiple federal probes by government appointed pitbulls like Atty. General Richard Thornburgh and directed against Harold Ford Sr., Maynard Jackson, Thomas Figures and others. Thornburgh was a criminal investigator appointed by Reagan back in 1988-91. {snip}</p>
<p>According to &#8220;Project Censored&#8221; website, among the (https://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/25-black-elected-officials-targeted-by-law/) &#8220;Top 25 Censored Stories of 1998&#8221; was &#8220;The black elected officials that were targeted by law.&#8221; Understand this, the same people whose job description is to track criminals or criminal behavior, literally began investigating black officials for no other reason other than their skin color. It get&rsquo;s worse. &#8220;Statistical evidence indicates that black elected officials tended to be investigated by law enforcement agencies at higher rates than white elected officials. According to the Washington-based Joint Center of Political and Economic Studies, in the past 25 years 70 members of Congress have faced criminal charges. Fifteen percent of those investigated have been minorities  &mdash;  four times their percentage in the legislative body.</p>
<p>PC quoted the Washington Post report that black elected officials were the target of investigations for corruption in 14 of the 465 political corruption cases launched between 1983 and 1998  &mdash;  a period in which blacks were just 3% of all office holders. GQ Magazine noted that between 1981-93 members of the Congressional Black Caucus were investigated or indicted: &#8220;For the number to be equal to white representatives, 204 of the 409 whites .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would have been subjected to the same scrutiny during that time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet according to the Justice Department figures, only 15 (whites) actually were.&#8221;</p>
<p>To break this down in terms of magnitude, it wasn&rsquo;t criminal or political improprieties that attracted the feds to &#8220;harass&#8221; the black official. Their criteria was 1-The higher the office 2-The most outspoken 3-The greater the influence or power. Manifestation of these earned equal magnitude of harassment. Of course this is simply Dr. Frances Cress Welsing&rsquo;s &#8220;Isis Papers&#8221; being acted out by members of the FBI and like-agencies. Fear of a black takeover, fear of black decision making, fear of black inferiority, fear of black crime, fear of black success, assigning character flaws to dark skin to contrast a myth of white skin, call it what you will. This fear and desperation actually cost one man his life.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These plots were no-doubt sour grapes measures towards black elected officials of formerly high-profile racist cities. Despicable ideas by a select few in government meant to slow or halt the tide of black leadership in southern enclaves highly populated by black voters. {snip}</p>
<p>It seemed the best backlash against civil rights was scandal, and multiple attempts to bring down black Mayors, congressmen, etc. around the same time was certainly more than coincidence. {snip}</p>
<p>Operation Bowtye still extended  &mdash;  at least unofficially  &mdash;  to the numerous black officials and Cabinet members in the Clinton Administration; Cliff Wharton, Mike Espy, Jocelyn Elders, Hazel O&rsquo;Leary, Alexis Herman and of course Ron Brown. {snip}<br>

		<p>&#8220;Black elected officials subject to criminal investigations more often than whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazing isn&rsquo;t it?  I mean, whether it&rsquo;s street crime, the results of low intelligence or government malfeasance blacks invariably try to make it appear as if catching these people in the act of committing crimes is wrong.</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they do so, because they&rsquo;re just too ignorant to understand that they should want someone punished for breaking the law no matter what color they are.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t.  If they&rsquo;re black they want to see them go unprosecuted and if they get out of jail for murder, mayhem, torture or whatever, they want to see those types vote.</p>
<p>Can anybody imagine how much BETTER this country would be without blacks? <br>

		<p>The cowardice of the press on this issue is unspeakable. Just try googling for real information on &#8220;African-American corruption&#8221;  &mdash;  most of the hits will be rants written by African-Americans lamenting the corruption of white America! Fact is, the patron-client relationships that structure African-American politics are inherently corrupt. That Harold Ford Sr. hit up a lobbyist (actually a black FBI agent) for $50,000 was just business as usual, not an exception. Same for all of the others. Even Charles Rangel  &mdash;  a man with an immense reputation for probity  &mdash;  turns out to have been cheating the IRS!</p>

It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be that black politicians, similar to black street criminals, are so brazen and unabashed in their criminality that it&rsquo;s virtually child&rsquo;s play to nail them dead to rights on a criminal charge. </p>

		<p>This is like claims of &#8216;profiling&rsquo;. What cop wants to arrest a carfull of black folks or a black guy on the street? It&rsquo;s just asking for trouble on a job that&rsquo;s tough enough already. Then there are the &#8216;watchdog&rsquo; groups (who only care about what happens to the chosen) that monitor the police. What lawmaker in this age of diversity wants to be seen or known as the one who goes after minorities in positions of power?</p>

		<p>Once again racism blinds liberals from the truth.I have represented a few black officials and also assisted others in getting off the hook when their lawyers wee too stupid to figure out what was going on. White prosecutors and investigators do not go hunting for black scalps, in fact it is the last thing they want to do. Crimes black civic leaders are charged with are usally small potatoes and garner no glory to the heat. In about 100% of the cases,some other black associate who is jealous, in trouble for serious crimes, or mad, rats them out. The scenario is always the same. They find some acne faced white girl reporter and make up wild charges of big time corruption. This forces the cops to start digging.<br>
     I knew one guy that ended up being charged with buying three hot suits and another for making a phoney loan affadavit to get his business started, a crime that is committed every time anybody ever seeks a loan. The Federal judge became enraged at the US Attorney for filing the charge and gave my guy a year`s probation. Of course he was still ruined. You Yankees have never been to a crab roast. But blacks are like crabs in the pot. Every time one almost gets out another pulls him back into the boiling water.<br>

		<p>This piece certainly makes the point (as we all know) that black pathology is a myth propagated by &#8220;de man.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now the white racist establishment has upped the ante by accusing celebrated black leaders of baseless criminal activity, this in the face of countless stirring examples of black political leadership throughout the nation spearheading the resurrection of countless previously derelict white neighborhoods!  Detroit, Cleveland, Gary, Newark, Columbus, Watts, the list of urban restoration at the hands of inspired black leadership is endless, and yet the myth of black pathology and criminality persists.   </p>

		<p>And how many of these investigated black pols were shown to be innocent?  It&rsquo;s not like there are no investigations of white ones!  There&rsquo;s a persistent myth that whites commit, per capita, more white-collar crime than blacks.  Actually, it&rsquo;s only the complicated, brain-powered crimes that are overwhelmingly non-black.  <br>
Blacks do know how to work this equation: power=opportunity to fleece.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have a city storage facility where there has been a lot of pilferage.  You set up surveillance, and arrest the first people you catch taking goods without authorization.  The word quickly gets out that the facility is under surveillance, so you only catch a handful of people, although the problem may be for more widespread.  Chances are that minorities will be overrepresented amongh those arrested, in comparison to the population of city employees as a whole, but so what?  </p>
<p>Living within your means, and refusing to take home &#8220;free stuff&#8221; for your family is not that hard.  Minorities often feel entitled to &#8220;reparations&#8221; and they therefore are more likely to get caught stealing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that black women often call in false or wildly exaggerated reports to Child Protective Services on other women with whom they have had a disagreement, so Mr. Tiffany&rsquo;s theory of petty jealousy may have a great deal of merit. </p>

		<p>The basic theme of Comrade Stevenson&rsquo;s piece is that blacks should not be investigated at all because, in his opinion, they are already over-investigated. Anyway, there is a general flaw to all of this. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a number of people - we&rsquo;ll call them Group A - is investigated for wrongdoing. In fact, Group A is more closely scrutinized than usual. However, no one in Group A is afoul of the law. So no matter how many people are investigated in Group A no law enforcement action ever occurs.</p>
<p>If blacks are innocent of any malfeasance then Mr. Stevenson should not be concerned about blacks being arrested. It&rsquo;s more likely that he doesn&rsquo;t want blacks investigated because crimes will most certainly be uncovered. </p>
<p>His next argument will be that ALL charges are trumped up and fictitious. Until then, his only recourse to not having blacks appear on the front page of the local news dressed in a new suit and with a lawyer standing by, is to not investigate ANY blacks. </p>
<p>Why so worried Chris? </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about other states, but Missouri is infamous for a very severe double standard when it comes to drug crimes&hellip;with whites getting the worse end of the stick.  Rural juries and judges in MO are infamous for throwing the book at young white men whose crime is a first time weed possession.  It is for this reason, and the state budget crunch, that there is a bill in the Missouri legislature that would prohibit prison time for almost all of the least serious classification and some of the second least serious classification of felony crime convictions.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, 20% of first time armed robbers in St. Louis City get no prison time.</p>

		<p>I think a big part of it is not the fact that blacks are simply more corrupt, although that is almost certainly the case,  but the simple fact is that blacks simply lack the abilities of introspection,  self reflection or the ability to feel shame or remorse.  Thus they will cling to power to the bitter end and force the authorities to engage in long protracted legal investigations rather than behaving honorably and stepping down when if they just stepped down like a typical white politican would, the probes and investigations would have been avoided.</p>
<p>For example when our Governor in NY Elliot Spitzer was revealed to have used prostitutes he felt the twang of guilt and shame and did the honorable thing and resigned.</p>
<p>On the other hand when his black replacement Paterson, was found ot have committed wrongs many times more severe, (e.g. using his office to threaten and harass a domestic violence victim) his knee jerk reaction is to snarl and lash out at the press and dig in his heels.</p>
<p>Thus the disparity grows! Spitzer avoided probes, indictments and chaos sparing both his family and his state a painful ordeal by admitting fault and resigning. </p>
<p>Paterson took the opposite approach attacking the media, the authorities, white society in general in a snarling all out attack, all while gloriously mismanging New York and driving the state deeper and deeper into bankruptcy and insolvancy. </p>

<p>Reporters (of any color) are bad at math. That&rsquo;s why they majored in journalism. We actually had a story on the local news that said Duke Energy was asking for a 13% rate increase, and that for the average family with a $100 monthly bill, their bill would go up by $18.<br>

<p>This actually makes a lot of sense, if we consider race as a proxy for intelligence.</p>
<p>An intelligent young man who is in court for a first offense and faces a stiff punishment may be convinced to turn himself around and will have a bright future.</p>
<p>A stupid young man charged with the same offense, is unlikely to amount to much no matter how he is treated. So why spend the state&rsquo;s money to incarcerate him? Put him back on the street and wait for one of his &#8220;brothers&#8221; to shoot him.<br>

<p>Actually, you are correct. The group Commonsense for Drug Policies and Sentencing a non-partisan group, as made the case that Whites are five more likely to use drugs like cocaine and ectasy than Blacks and other non-Whites, yet non-Whites are ten times more likely to be prosecuted for drug use. There is something wrong with this picture.</p>
<p>This group has ran several ads in a number of publications such as the New Republic, National Review, The Weekly Standard, The Nation etc.. They obviously do not have a politcal agenda.   </p>
