<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>LSU Sociology Professor Edward Shihadeh and Ph.D. candidate Raymond Barranco have published a study titled &#8220;Latino Employment and Black Violence: The Unintended Consequence of U.S. Immigration Policy,&#8221; in the March 2010 issue of Social Forces, the field&rsquo;s preeminent journal.</p>
<p>The study confirms that Latino immigration and dominance of low skill jobs have displaced blacks from low-skill labor markets, which in turn led to more violence in urban black communities. According to their analysis, this is traceable to U.S. immigration policies over the last several decades.</p>
<p>Before the United States/Mexico border was militarized, Latino immigration was a two-way trip; immigrants, mainly from Central America, moved to the United States temporarily to finance a project in their home country. But in response to U.S. public pressure, border security was intensified. Tall fences were built, cameras installed and the border was patrolled relentlessly by well-armed guards. As a result, Latino immigrants in the United States stopped returning home for fear that they could not repeat the trip. This increased the number of Latino workers in the United States competing for jobs in agriculture, manufacturing and construction. Blacks lost that competition in many cities, and where that occurred, murder rates went up.</p>
<p>&#8220;{snip} We do not advocate restricting the flow of Latino migrants in either direction. This is what triggered the flow of events in the first place. There is no reason to deprive this country of the rich contributions made by Latinos. Our study simply describes how immigration policy opened a new chapter in the history of the U.S. labor market and how that harmed black communities,&#8221; [said Shihadeh]</p>

		<p>What a surprise!  Who woulda thought!  Liberal academia recognizes that the influx of hispanics illegally flooding across the border (1) takes jobs from blacks and (2) results in increased violence.  But, of COURSE, the fault is put on increased security AT the border.  And the recommendation?  Can you guess?  STOP patrolling the border, so the poor illegal invaders can cross freely back home - like they would, right?  And give up all those free bennies like free health care in the ER&rsquo;s, welfare, free public schooling, and free use of our national forests to grow their weed?  Yeah.  Oh, and this Socialist shill forgot to mention&hellip;.the great deal of violence inflicted ON the blacks BY the illegal hispanic invaders as the invaders first steal the territory from blacks, then steal the entire Southwest from all of us.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think black crime went up because cheap Hispanic laborers took jobs that otherwise would have went to blacks.  I think the reason for any increase was the diverse competition of the drug trade in areas where blacks and Hispanics both occupy.</p>

		<p>Most companies would rather hire illegals, if they can get away with it, because illegals work harder, longer, and better than African-Americans.  Illegals also cause less problems, and cost substantially less in salary.  As a result, African-Americans are definitely being displaced from non-professional, low-skilled jobs. </p>
<p>Without the constant influx of millions of Hispanic wage-slaves, companies would have to pay livable wages to obtain workers. That meat-packing plant, carpet mill, or restaurant will pay $15, $20, $25 per hr   &mdash;   what ever it takes to attract workers. Hence, salaries for low-skilled jobs would rise, and low-skilled African-Americans could not only obtain work, but actually make a good salary. </p>
<p>Yet, the amazing thing is that many (not all) African-Americans support open borders   &mdash;   to their own detriment!  Unbelievably stupid!</p>

		<p>Hey, we coulda tolja that YEARS ago!!!  Most employers would rather hire a Hispanic than a black - Hispanics are less violent and won&rsquo;t go squalling about racism every time you pass gas sideways.  Blacks have not, in the main, availed themselves of the educational opportunities that they could have had, and so remain at the low-skill level, which Hispanics can fill just as well.  Blacks need to stop whining, stop wanting something for nothing, start finishing school, and train for a decent career.  This is not magic.  It&rsquo;s pure common sense.  We were always told, &#8220;Lower your expectations and improve your performance!&#8221;  It works, no kidding.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember a time when black males were interested in doing agricultural, manufacturing, or construction jobs. Agriculture smacks of the plantation  &mdash;  can&rsquo;t ask a black to do THAT without being a racist  &mdash;  and the other two are fine if, rather than building things, an employer wants to spend every day arguing about who&rsquo;s failing to show respect, and/or who&rsquo;s violating whose civil rights.</p>
<p>What a dumb study! They argue as if Latino migrants staying permanently instead of working temporarily and leaving is a phenomenon of the past half dozen years or so rather than of the past half century. Each premise that builds the thesis is so ludicrous as to not be worth refuting.</p>
<p>As a member of academia, I regret having ever thought that a person with a PhD had to be smart! With a Latino surname, though, I&rsquo;m sure the candidate will whiz through his dissertation defense.</p>

<p>Take note of the fact that these PC dregs made a point to applaud mestizos for their &#8220;rich contribution&#8221; to this country, but I&rsquo;m betting they couldn&rsquo;t offer a single instance of such nonsense that would hold up under scrutiny.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that all aware people KNOW that this diversity nonsense is a recipe for disaster and causing black/mestizo clashes is only one of many violent aspects that this ideology brings with it.</p>
<p>Dark days are ahead.  It&rsquo;s beginning right now.  We&rsquo;re into it, and it will be getting worse on a daily basis until large scale civil unrest rips this empire apart.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for a moment that Latino employment is in any way connected to the rise in Black violence. There simply are more Blacks and so, more violence. As the Black population grows the violence will grow in tandem. The more Blacks the more murder, rape, assault&hellip;etc. It is no more complicated than that. Academics, like most politicians and many White, Latino and Oriental peoples of a liberal stripe will also continue to over rationalize this phenomenon to the point of lunacy.</p>

		<p>I always find it amusing when a well-researched &#8220;study&#8221; invariably bears out and substantiates we we already learned and know. That unskilled Blacks are always displaced in the low-end job market by illegal immigrants. That illegals, also are seen as &#8220;better workers, more trustworthy&#8221; by hiring managers than Blacks, which means the illegals get the jobs&hellip; &#8220;they appeared to have proper documentation&#8221; being the proffered excuse. This excuse also explains the antipathy toward a national ID verification database. Given it would prevent employers from hiring illegals.</p>
<p>But greed (money) always trumps common sense. So you can count on Blacks&rsquo; continued ineffectively competing in the low-end job arena and the social problems   &mdash;   violence   &mdash;   continuing to increase.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;BTW, am I the only one who noticed that Hispanic customer service reps are unusually obnoxious?..&#8221;</p>
<p>This is very common in S. California.  I despise rude, obnoxious clerks and have lately taken to fighting back and complaining directly to the company about them  &mdash;  as everyone here should do.</p>
<p>I am sick and tired of spending my hard-earned money in a super market, department store, auto supply business, Target, fast food place or anywhere else I am dropping my wages only to be treated contemptuously by low-level, non-White clerks with what I perceive is White hatred.</p>
<p>Knowing that many companies are struggling, live and die by word of mouth and can&rsquo;t afford to lose business,  I go on-line, find the company&rsquo;s website, go to the &#8216;Contact Us&rsquo; section and write away to any/all e mails addresses available.  If there is any public forum available anywhere allowing feedback about a particular company (this is popular with hotels), go there as well and complain  &mdash;  I understand  poor ratings on these sites murder businesses.  I read them and I assume a lot of others do as well.</p>
<p>Keep your complaints as generic as possible and leave out any mention of race-although if language is a problem, use it, such as: &#8216;The clerk had a heavy accent and I couldn&rsquo;t understand a word he said, so I&rsquo;m going over to (rival&rsquo;s business).&rsquo;  Never, ever use profanity and always keep your missive as professional and dispassionate as possible.</p>
<p>Be sure to mention the name of the obnoxious person. I state what I purchased, how I was treated and especially why I will never patronize or set foot in this particular business again  &mdash;  and I plan to pass this on to my family, colleagues and friends.  I also mention their rival prominently and state something like:  &#8220;I have switched my business to ____ because I was treated so poorly by your employees.&#8221;<br>
If the item can be purchased on-line (especially tax-free), I&rsquo;ll throw that in as well.</p>
<p>I then contact the rival business and let them know they have a new customer because of the way I was treated at their rival&rsquo;s business.  One &#8216;rival&rsquo; business contacted me and asked if my e mail could be used as part of their training sessions.  I told them &#8216;with pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I prefer to patronize businesses with &#8216;self-service&rsquo; check-outs so I don&rsquo;t have to deal with surly clerks. As the old saying goes:  &#8216;Put your money where your mouth is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Unfettered hispanic immigration has been going on for more than three decades now, displacing blacks in their historic ghettos  &mdash;  places like Compton and Watts in LA.</p>
<p>The politicians that &#8216;represent&rsquo; blacks are pro-open borders  &mdash;  but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>To blacks, The Great White Bigot is a much bigger threat  &mdash;  The Great White Bigot that has handed blacks welfare, preferences, section 8 housing, free college tuition and more is the True Enemy, not hispanics that have pushed blacks out of their neighborhoods, workplaces and schools, using violence and threats to do so.  Many &#8216;historic&rsquo; black areas of LA are now 80% or more hispanic.  </p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Congratulations Black Community!  In California you have done what you set out to do.  You have driven the Great White Bigot out of the state (or so you think).</p>
<p>While you were busy seeking out The Great White Bigot, who you believe oppresses you and discriminates against you, your race-based politicians, who say they represent you, have sold you out.  You can be sure the new hispanic majority won&rsquo;t buy your feeble arguments of &#8216;legacy of slavery&rsquo;, notions of &#8216;reparations&rsquo;, and go along with preferences for your race over theirs  &mdash;  you see, unlike us, hispanics are allowed to form advocacy groups that promote ONLY the needs of their own race, not yours.  There is no place for you in their world.</p>
<p>Hispanics are about to become politically dominant in California.  After that, you will know what oppression and discrimination are really about.</p>
<p>And, don&rsquo;t come running to us with your complaints.</p>

		<p>I wanted to add that I notice the Democrats rattling the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Saber against unruly Whites daring to defy them on Obamacare.  They believe that if they amnesty all the illegal Mestizos (and we know well there are many more than that 12-15 million figure our lying government has been stuck at forever) that they will hold power into perpetuity.</p>
<p>I have one thing to say.  Be my guest.  Go ahead.  Do it and see what happens.  Can our elite be so damned stupid to believe that Mestizos (who are in peonage to the White elite of Mexico) risked life and limb, went into hock to pay off coyotes, and crossed great deserts at personal risk only to go into peonage to the White elite of America?</p>
<p>I live in an area that is primarily Mestizo.  Once Mestizos get a majority, they vote in Mestizos.  I don&rsquo;t care how good an American politician has been to them.  We had one black council woman who was very responsive and conscientious about her job.  The moment a mestizo ran against her, she was voted out.  Her record on the job meant nada to these people.  </p>
<p>I strongly suggest you take your spanking and sulk in the corner until the Repugnants screw up the works by letting the NeoCons talk them into taking the country into war against Iran.  </p>
<p>But if your desperation to hold onto power for the next election cycle that you must amnesty the Mestizos, by all means do so.  Congress will be completely Mestizo by 2012.  The Senate will be completely Mestizo by 2016.  Go for it, Morons.  </p>
