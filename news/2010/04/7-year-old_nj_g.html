	<p>A 7-year-old Trenton girl was sold like a prostitute to a pack of perverts and gang raped by up to seven men and boys.</p>
<p>And the person who pimped out the grade-schooler was her 15-year-old stepsister, cops said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the boys do what they want to do,&#8221; the teen told the younger girl as the leering lechers looked on  &mdash;  then stepped back and watched the men molest her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t even know what to say,&#8221; Trenton Police Capt. Joseph Juniak said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s incomprehensible.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The horror show happened Sunday when the teen took the 7-year-old along to a party and left her unattended in the living room while she had sex for money with several men in a bedroom.</p>
<p>When she was done, the teen gave her stepsister a wad of cash and told her to let the men &#8220;touch her,&#8221; said Juniak.</p>
<p>&#8220;It went from touching to straight out assault and rape,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They threatened to kill her if she screamed or told anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 15-year-old was charged with aggravated sexual assault, promoting prostitution and other crimes. She was in a juvenile lockup and prosecutors plan to try her as an adult.</p>
<p>More than a dozen people were at the party and cops were trying to identify the culprits.<br>

								<h2>27 Arrests at High-Rise Where Child Was Gang Raped</h2>
						<p>
							<i>CBS News, April 2, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Police raided a New Jersey public housing complex Thursday where officials say a 7-year-old girl was gang raped, and arrested 27 people on outstanding warrants. </p>
<p>Trenton Mayor Doug Palmer said the pre-dawn sweep of Rowan Towers was planned before the girl&rsquo;s attack. He said police hope the arrests will lead to tips that help them find those who assaulted the girl, otherwise the arrests were unrelated to the case. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the mayor says the arrests are unrelated, police hope they lead to tips that help them find the suspects. </p>
<p>The stepsister is charged with aggravated sexual assault, promoting prostitution and other crimes. No other arrests directly related to the case have been made. </p>
<p>The encounters allegedly happened inside the Rowan Towers Apartments Sunday afternoon. The teen was said to have willingly engaged in sex with multiple men for cash herself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said they have DNA evidence, some surveillance video and leads but need to zero in on exactly who was in the apartment. They said they anticipate making multiple arrests of both juvenile and adult males.</p>
<p>Many of those arrested Thursday were women, who told The Associated Press the warrants were for minor infractions. Police did not immediately return calls for further details. </p>
<p>Residents said the assault was clearly at the forefront of police officers&rsquo; agenda during the raid at the apartment building, a high-rise complex so dangerous that police are hired as security guards at night. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police believe as many as a dozen people were at the party and say everyone in the apartment when the rape occurred could be legally culpable. There were security cameras at the complex and police said they were reviewing all available building surveillance videos.<br>

		<p>Even refusing to &#8220;snitch&#8221; could result in felony charges against anyone who was present at the party.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;misprision of a felony&#8221;, and is a felony all by itself.</p>

		<p>While this crime was committed by blacks, and I am no fan of black folks, this transcends race.  How in heavens name could a 15 year old girl NOT have the basic instinct to protect her 7 year old sister?  Shouldn&rsquo;t that be inborn.  Even in a 15 year old?  It boggles the mind.  And the male participants, how could they find anything sexual about a 7 year old child?  How could they possibly derive any pleasure from such a horrific act?  Would this have happened in the black community 50 years ago?  It is hard to believe that black men would have not done something if this happened 50 years ago.  Or am I that naive?</p>
<p>The perpetrators should get life imprisonment, yes, even a 15 year old girl!  These &#8220;people&#8221; are beyond hope of redemption.  The 7 year old is ruined, nothing will make her right.  Her life is ruined and so the lives of the miscreants should also be ruined.</p>
<p>I used to watch a show about meerkats, an African type of rodent.  Their family structure was amazing.  Adolescent meerkats babysat the little ones.  They were truly concerned for the safety of the other family members.  How could any human, no matter how mentally undeveloped not have the same protective feelings towards her own blood kin?</p>

		<p>When I read a brief version of this story on Wednesday I knew that the girls were black! The summary on Fox News did not mention anything about the housing project, but the depraved nature of the crime pointed to black perps. <br>
It&rsquo;s very disturbing, though not surprising, that not one person at the party raised a finger to protect a 7 year old girl! <br>

		<p>It is truly mind-blowing that this could happen among a &#8220;non-pedo&#8221; group at a party. So many people had to know and they all just went along with it! Sheesh even if they didn&rsquo;t have a problem with it surely they should have realized there would be likely arrests!</p>
<p>And yes it does appear the people involved were black, Rowan Towers is apparently a very rough ghetto housing project and the few defendants mentioned in various articles had very black names.</p>

		<p>My guess is, sex crime other than rape (domestic abuse, child molestation, incest, sexual slavery, etc.) is a relatively much greater problem amongst blacks than whites, but is obfuscated by the &#8220;don&rsquo;t snitch&#8221; mentality, and the usual whitewashing from the media and white liberals.</p>

		<p>This is more likely complicity than misprision (i.e. failing to report rather than concealing); and the 15 year old is a stepsister, which provides some basis for her predation.</p>

		<p>To poster #2.  I used to teach in the Bronx and I had &#8216;students&rsquo; who were so unbalanced they were capable of anything.  One student bragged in class one day about how he wanted to put a kid&rsquo;s head in a window and slam it shut on their skull over and over.  </p>
<p>The stuff I saw over three years.  I concluded I would never, ever, ever live in a ghetto neighborhood for as long as I lived.  Even the girls wanted to cuss, fight and break things all the time.  </p>
<p>I guess Arne Duncan would say Teach for America can help those kids.  Heh.  That&rsquo;s a another education fad that will fall flat on its face after these first few years of manipulated statistics and outright untruths from the admins who routinely &#8216;fix&rsquo; the grades at the end.</p>

		<p>What is really mind blowing is the original article. In this article, the reporter quoted one of the residents of this house project where this gang rape happened. The woman said &#8220;It is the police&rsquo;s fault this happened because they did not patrol the area.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it is not the step-sister&rsquo;s fault for pimping out her seven-year old step-sister and it is not the the men who raped this child who are at fault. They are not to blame. It is the fault of the police &#8220;because they did not patrol the area,&#8221; even though this happened inside an apartment building where they would need x-ray superhero vision to see that this was going on.</p>

		<p>First time poster but since I&rsquo;m a regular visitor to this site and lifelong resident of Trenton I&rsquo;ll offer a thought.  235 years ago George Washington led a hopeless frozen army to impossible victory here, turning the tide of that conflict and taking the pipedream of nationhood a giant leap closer to reality.  Crack and heroin are sold now within walking distance of the site of that battle.  <br>
Nearly 100 years ago, the fastest car in the world at the time, the Mercer Raceabout, was being produced here while Enzo Ferrari was shoeing mules in the backwoods of Italy.  The factory stands empty, graffiti covered and forgotten today.  I drive by it every morning, and I know no one else driving by knows or cares about what was made there.  <br>
The cables for the Golden Gate Bridge were made here by the once famous Roebling Bridge Company, now a complex of bland state office buildings where nothing is produced but extra sick days and 80% of salary pensions.  The entirely white neighborhood where I spent a happy and safe childhood has been replaced by illegal alien whorehouses and unlicensed bars. This happened in less than 20 years.  A fight happened there last week in broad daylight between a man armed with a machete vs. man armed with a baseball bat.  And now my home town has made international news because a 7 year old black was gang raped by blacks in a housing project funded by taxes on my labor.  <br>
Stay strong out there.                       </p>

<p>You are very naive indeed. And yes, black men did this 50 years ago and much further back than that. Read up on Africans in Africa. And as poster #7 stated, read up on the Selma marchers and MLK for that matter. Also read up on the Newsome/Christian rapes and murders and the Wichita case committed by the Carr brothers. </p>

		<p>Sadly, I think most with common sense knew or assumed this was a degenerate blacks acting like degenerate blacks story. Gang Rape of this type is quite common in the Black community as well as the Mex-Central American community. These stories drift out of ghetto/project/barrio warrens on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Although it is possible some &#8220;white trash&#8221; could be involved, my guess is &#8220;black on black crime&#8221; here.  </p>
<p>I say &#8220;degenerate blacks&#8221;, because it is a subset, not the norm.</p>

		<p>Interesting that a 15-year-old can be tried as an adult   &mdash;   WHEN THEY WANT TO. </p>
<p>If this had involved the rape or even MURDER of a white victim, the culprit would NOT be tried as an adult. Excuses would be made for the youth of the perpetrator/s.</p>

<p>And if the cops did patrol those projects?  The aforementioned woman would be first in line screaming about racial profiling.  If said cops on said patrols stray from the ACLU Field Manual as much as one iota, especially if it were white cops, they would be hung out to dry.</p>

<p>I understand there is a bridge across the Delaware River from Trenton to Pennsylvania which has the phrase, &#8220;Trenton Makes, The World Takes&#8221; along one side.  It is supposed to signify Trenton&rsquo;s once upon a time vast manufacturing base.  The manufacturing is gone, but the sign on the bridge still exists.  Do you think that mass gang rapes of 7-year old girls is now what the world will take from Trenton?</p>

		<p>When a particularly fiendish crime is committed by a white person, isn&rsquo;t that white person usually a loner, or in partnership with one other person?</p>
<p>But what I notice in this crime is what was even more evident in the Christian/Newsom torture murders (I&rsquo;ve followed those trials fairly closely): the crimes were committed by an apparently ordinary group of thug relatives and family friends as just sort of an impulsive exaggeration of their &#8220;normal&#8221; day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>I think if you asked thugs how they felt about the Christian/Newsom crimes, they would express none of the bewilderment whites express over the casual extremity of the crimes.</p>
<p>Such crimes seem to me just black thug parties that got a little more out of hand than usual. Or than we usually hear about.</p>

<p>Years ago I heard a first hand account of the public displays of sexuality among the Selma marchers.  It was my first inkling that the Southerners were justified in their attempts to keep segregation, and that they were being unfairly demonized. Do you have any references you could give?  Thanks</p>

<p>Of course they&rsquo;ll blame this on the police for not patrolling the area. And if the police had patrolled the area, they&rsquo;d screech about harassment and over-surveillance.</p>

		<p>#10, Anonymous, I too have lived in the Trenton region all my life and it has indeed gone downhill fast. What used to be the pride of industry, &#8220;What Trenton Makes, the World Takes,&#8221; is now a wasteland of shattered housing projects and decrepit, boarded-up businesses. The streets are riddled with crime, drug dealing, prostitution, and carjackings. In every edition of The Times you can read about crackheads getting stabbed and worse on Calhoun St. Trenton has become a dangerous blackopolis to be avoided at all cost. It ranks right up there with Camden and Newark as a lost cause. If it weren&rsquo;t the state capitol, it would be just another American urban paradise, dragged down by its black inhabitants.</p>

		<p>@7:  As much as it disappoints me to turf the story, the &#8220;debauchery&#8221; during the Selma marches is largely nonsense.  A few minutes with Google searches and an objective mind would put those stories to rest.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to do away with those stories because propagating them makes us look ignorant and marginalizes the message.  We&rsquo;re hardly desperate for stories; there are so many glaring truthful examples every day and in spite of the media&rsquo;s PC attempts to sanitize the news. This story, for example, was first headlined as occurring in a &#8220;high rise,&#8221; implying upscale whites, as opposed to a &#8220;housing project,&#8221; which&hellip; well, you know.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a story just for today:  My brother works security for a very trendy night club in Hollywood, CA.  Once or twice a night the security team has to respond to a &#8220;code one,&#8221; which is their term for a highly intoxicated person that has to be removed from the club.  When said person is a female, a guard has to wait with her on the sidewalk until either a companion gets a vehicle and picks her up, or she gets into a cab and closes the door behind her.  They do that because, like vultures, Blacks and Latinos swarm to an intoxicated female like moths to a flame and aggressively try to usher her away for rape.  Last night, in the few seconds it took to give instructions to a cab driver, a black had already put his arm around the woman my brother was watching and had her 30 feet up the street, headed for his car.</p>

		<p>One of the sadder elements of this horrific crime is the profound embarrassment and humiliation that decent blacks must feel when stories such as this one are reported.  Unlike stories about deranged individuals such as Jeffrey Dahmer, which for obvious reasons cause no distress among whites, this involved a number of willing participants, none of whom would be judged clinically insane.  And all of whom should face the death penalty, I&rsquo;m quite sure with the willing support of all law-abiding blacks.</p>

		<p>14 - Question Diversity. You are so right. There is no way to win with the blacks in the projects. They cannot control their own behavior and the law of permutations indicates that with the multiplicity of suicidal and homicidal behaviors that they engage in (and then how all of those various behaviors link to each other ad infinitum), you can never anticipate what will go wrong. The only thing you can anticipate is that something will go wrong and it will go very, very wrong, and they will blame an external authority (like the police, whom they hate for telling them what to do) for their own behavior (or lack of proper behavior).</p>

		<p>The story gives no indication that the partygoers had been selected for pedophilia or degeneracy.</p>
<p>The only conclusion to draw is that if THIS roomful of blacks could do such a thing, ANY gathering of blacks could do just as much.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that. I honestly do not think it shames any of them. In addition I am sure the family and friends of these people will be quick to say &#8220;he is a good person, he was working on his G.E.D. and planning to get a job and a loving father to his 4 kids by 4 different women&#8221; etc&hellip;</p>

<p>Right you are, the same sort of conduct happened in Compton and Watts in caliFOREIGNER where I have lived.  I joined the Army at the end of 65 so missed some of em, and TO #19 Phil, these things and conduct DID happen with the Selma marchers and according to some of my own family members, it happened along the entire route of any march the blacks did with lots of white women involved, sadly!</p>

		<p>Different races view morality differently.  Imagine any 10 of your White male friends   &mdash;   would they do this?  Would they allow it? Would they refuse to snitch on those who did?  </p>
<p>This difference in innate morality is one of the things that sets the African sub-species apart from the European sub-species.  Watch the news about Africa   &mdash;   there is almost constant brutality, from burnings, to dismemberment to child rape to witch killing, and on, and on.  They cannot help it, because it is in their genes, the same way it is in my genes to vomit at the thought of grown men raping a helpless 7-yr old.  </p>
<p>When this lack of morality is combined with low intellegence, a high sex urge, over emmotion, and lack of self control and ambition, then you have a race who will never, never fit in with Europeans.   </p>

		<p>As soon as I read this, I knew these girls had to be black.  No &#8220;other-populated&#8221; high rise would be so dangerous they have to hire cops for security.  And no other ethnic group would be so callous as to place her 7 year old sister in a position to be gang-raped.  Nope, only blacks do that.  Mexicans would die for a family member - in fact all Hispanics would; Muslims would kill anyone who even looked at their sister; whites wouldn&rsquo;t be there in the first place   &mdash;   so what further proof do we need?</p>

		<p>I read another version of this story at another website before coming here.  Based on that story, the 7-year old girl is being relocated with her family for safety reasons.  One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed missing is any indication of outrage or condemnation from the girl&rsquo;s parents.  This leads me to suspect that the 15-year old&rsquo;s moral turpitude runs through the blood lines.  After all, the parents did have (at least) some role in the teenager&rsquo;s non-stellar upbringing.  I personally feel that relocation is a terrible strategy if the family&rsquo;s dynamics are not examined closely first; wherever they move, their pathologies will follow.  That&rsquo;s akin to lifting a tub of dirty water and placing it in a much prettier setting.</p>

		<p>Horrific crime? yes, Social problem? Yes. Symptom of our society? Yes.  Result of poor unemployed ineducable presumably black people squashed together in a run-down high rise? Yes,to all of this.</p>
<p>But just for a moment come with me to half a world away to almost any part of inland Australia, in fact any town with a race problem or to almost any Aboriginal settlement. What will you see, no high rise buildings, just the endless expanse of the outback. You will see almost total unemployment, violence, murder, prostitution, horrific child sexual abuse, rape, venereal diseases, AIDS, alcohol abuse, alcoholism, petrol sniffing, vandalism, sickness, poverty and a population attempting to live a pointless sub-3rd world existence. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The government has thrown hundreds of millions of dollars toward providing education, training, health services and even job creation for these people but with little positive result. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Like those living in a high rise in Trenton NJ there are millions of people out there whose whole existence has become totally pointless, this tends to destroy any concept of decency, morality or law and order.</p>
<p>Penalties for this crime must be harsh, there is even a case for reinstating the death penalty and certainly life sentences are called for. There is no place for this type of crime in ANY society.</p>
<p>One solution which I am sure Amren may agree with is to stop exporting jobs to the 3rd world. (Before USA becomes part of the 3rd world) Give these people something real to do, not just artificial AA taxpayer-funded non-jobs. </p>

 I think that #13 meant that if the victim were White and the perpetrators Black, they would noT be tried as adults.<br>
This 15 year old so called sister should be liquidated ASAP.<br>

		<p>Typical behavior, it&rsquo;s all in their genes/jeans, sic, and since they lay proud claim to their Afro backgrounds, this sort of behavior is commonplace in Africa. There even babies are raped, and beastiality is rampant. Why would any sane person think this to be unusual? Furthermore to the earlier poster who thought many blacks would be saddened by this, maybe, but only perhaps because the girls were black.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that. I honestly do not think it shames any of them. In addition I am sure the family and friends of these people will be quick to say &ldquo;he is a good person, he was working on his G.E.D. and planning to get a job and a loving father to his 4 kids by 4 different women&rdquo; etc&hellip;</p>
<p>I have some first hand evidence to back Sonya up. I work with a loud mouth inner city black female. She is obsessed with serial killers, ahem, white serial killers. She&rsquo;ll say stuff like that be totally evil and sick and such. I would like to show her the web page (is it still maintained?) on The Myth of Black Serial Killers, however I would like to keep my job so I keep my mouth shut. <br>
Meanwhile there is no mention of black on white depravities by my Afro colleagues. Some like the Wichita and Knoxville murders they may not know of. Local examples of Afro depravities do not register and really that is probably the fault of the media. Thank goodness for AMREN, Nicholas Stix and others who are at least getting some info out there but it will be a long time (hell freezing over?) before the mainstream starts to talk about black on white crime and how it IS a factor in race relations.</p>

<p>Aborigines are an almost perfect physical recapitulation of Homo erectus. Anatomically modern humans are Homo homo erectus. Even though modern cladistics uses the Linneas method of classification, describing an animal or plant by the convention of two names, to describe modern-day humans, it is actually technically correct to use three names because there was an evolutionary jump that occurred to make modern humans, well, modern and fully human.</p>
<p>Aborigines are kind of a genetic throwback to a more primitive human type. They are most likely truly out-of-Africa (I will never be convinced the white race is out of Africa or that we evolved from blacks) and through isolation in Australia, they have retained their primitive characteristics. And you are correct, Aborigines engage in horrific child abuse that makes Africans look civilized by comparison. </p>
<p>In addition, human IQ begins at 46. The median or average IQ of Australian Aborigines is about 57. The median IQ of American blacks is 85, and 85 is considered retarded.</p>

		<p>#2, the girls were not blood kin, but step-sisters.  Which makes it even less surprising that a black 15-year-old &#8220;girl&#8221; would be capable of this, as this child is of no real relation to her.  Quite possibly the two could only recently have met.  </p>
<p>Of course, if we were talking about whites it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the older girl had never seen the younger in her life, this would not have happened unless the older was on drugs and/or so deeply immersed in black &#8220;culture&#8221; that she totally lost any sense of humanity.</p>

<p>  Newark, New Jersey resembled a sophisticated European city in the 1870/1880s. It had a rich cultural life, beautiful parks, good schools, etc. Many of Newark&rsquo;s habitants were skilled German immigrants. Newark became a center of the Jewelry industry at the turn of the last century. During the 1920s many Jewish, Polish and Italian immigrants lived and worked in Newark. Hardworking Italian Americans kept the city solvent and reasonably safe until the race riots of the nineteen sixties. Today, Newark is little different than any decaying urban center inhabited by a majority blacks and now increasingly non Mexican Hispanics.</p>
