			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, April 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, the sole Republican working on a bill to legalize illegal immigrants, in effect put the bill on the shelf on Tuesday, saying that a debate now would destroy any prospects for passage and that the issue needs to wait until 2012.</p>
<p>The remarks likely signal the end of any serious chance for broad immigration legislation to pass this year, since Mr. Graham, South Carolina Republican, was the best hope for a partnership with President Obama and Democrats who want to write a bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible for me and any other serious Democrat to get this body to move forward until we prove to the American people we can secure our borders,&#8221; Mr. Graham told Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who was testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But under close questioning by Mr. Graham, Ms. Napolitano could not say whether she would declare the border secure if she were still the governor of Arizona. She called it an &#8220;unfair question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a fair question, and I&rsquo;ll give you my answer: I don&rsquo;t think it is,&#8221; Mr. Graham said. &#8220;I think since the last effort to solve immigration the border situation has deteriorated.&#8221;</p>

Graham knows that immigration reform (or as he refers to it, amnesty) is career suicide. This is an election year and with the economy not yet recovered, anyone in any party supporting &#8216;immigration reform&rsquo; would lose.</p>
<p>After the election, watch Graham and McCain re-board the amnesty express.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not completely comfortable with the argument that we should secure the borders before we address immigration. It seems likely that once the borders are secured people not directly effected by illegal immigrants will be more than happy to forget about it, meaning in time the illegals already here will become defacto citizens.  Perhaps it is better to address the borders and immigration together if there is any hope of deporting these people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;No bill until Americans are satisfied that border is secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never underestimate the pathology of these radical leftist fools that now control Congress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to say they&rsquo;re crazy for driving the country to bankruptcy with unchecked spending, but a more accurate assessment is that they&rsquo;re just the usual leftist fools who are so out of touch with the real world they can&rsquo;t be predicted to act in any particular manner, because their minds are so burdened with absurd flights of fantasy they pose a danger even to themselves, but they are unaware of it and instead think they are doing the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that any one of them could well be responsible for destroying the country after passing some kind of foolish legislation, but see themselves as someone who should have a statue erected of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cure for ignorance, but not stupidity. <br>

		<p>They will never secure our borders because they all want nonwhites to flood us out of our own land. In the meantime there will be millions more coming across the border to be legalized in 2012. What fools most White Americans are who buy into this garbage.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t hold you breath then, Mr. Graham. We don&rsquo;t need amnesty, nor a &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; for criminals. We need to have them deported. Or perhaps you&rsquo;re another open borders fanatic who doesn&rsquo;t understand what &#8220;illegal&#8221; means. Look it up. If anyone is &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; or &#8220;misguided&#8221; enough to try to pass an amnesty there will never be anyone who will come correctly. We already look like fools to the rest of the world. For the country who once could do anything, we can&rsquo;t even control our own borders, nor do we have anyone with the courage to demand the invaders leave.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a story floating around that Senator Graham is being blackmailed by people in positions of power who want the amnesty pushed through.  It&rsquo;s curious how he&rsquo;s backed away from &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; since this story was leaked.  </p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t need to wait till 2012.  The midterm elections are six months away and a clear majority of Congressmen who are pro-enforcement will do the trick.  A Federal type law similar to what Arizona just recently passed only nationwide plus make it a felony will clear out the illegal refuse.  Tackling the birthright citizenship should also be another priority.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;It is impossible for me or any other serious democrat to move foreward   &mdash;  &#8221;. Would this not qualify as a true Freudian slip? Sleasey Graham is a true RINO in every sense. I feel confident he&rsquo;ll go the way of the DODO bird at the next chance for his removal. Traitors such as he and Mr Steele are the damnation of the republican party. </p>

<p><i>&ldquo;It is impossible for me and any other serious Democrat to get this body to move forward until we prove to the American people we can secure our borders,&rdquo; Mr. Graham told Homeland Security Secretary&hellip;&#8221;</i> </p>
<p><br>
Mr. Graham, you and the rest of your &gt; co-conspirators have had DECADES to get serious about securing the border. And in all this time you&rsquo;ve done nothing but WEAKEN it! </p>
<p>But now you read the poll numbers&hellip; and you see what&rsquo;s being said in the blogs&hellip; and you fear the times are turning against you   &mdash;   so now arrogant traitors like you and fellow RINO Juan McCain are suddenly desperate to sound committed to somehow stemming the brown tide from the south. Committed to, you know, actually doing what the voters of the Southwest have been WANTING you to do since the 1980s (if not earlier). </p>
<p>One part of the Grahamnesty quote above is, however, correct: the part where the wording unintentionally implies that he&rsquo;s including himself among &#8220;serious Democrats.&#8221; </p>
<p>Freudian slip, Senator?</p>

<p>Like others here, I caught this slip. I had already informed Mr. Graham that I intend to vote against him (I live in his district) and e-mail him regularly from here in Afghan and have also done so when in Iraq. I told him I believe he is for amnesty and his (PUBLIC) opinion would only change if he foresaw a threat to his job, but as soon as the threat is passed he would go back to pushing amnesty.e.g I WILL vote against you!</p>

		<p>Well, one way of making sure the border is secure by 2012, is by getting rid of Senator Lindsay Graham, before then. Otherwise, like clockwork, this traitor will push for it, AGAIN,before that time. He even admits that in 2012 the time will be &#8220;right&#8221; for amnesty. Still, he doesn&rsquo;t get it. The time will NEVER be right in the minds of millions of Americans, for giving border criminals and Mexican nationalists amnesty. God, am I sick of this pr-ck.</p>
