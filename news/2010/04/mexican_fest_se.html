<h1><a href="https://www.ocregister.com/news/day-241684-moreno-city.html">Mexican Fest Set for Sept. 11 Sparks Protest</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cindy Carcamo, Orange County Register, March 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A downtown celebration honoring Mexico&rsquo;s bicentennial is sparking a firestorm of protests and angry e-mails after city officials decided to kick off the festivities on the day that marks nine years since the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>
<p>A group of anti-illegal immigration activists picketed last weekend in front of the Mexican consulate and plans another protest Wednesday morning. The group also expects to hold a protest at next week&rsquo;s City Council meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Santa Ana City Manager Dave Ream said they&rsquo;ve made the decision to celebrate on that day and don&rsquo;t see a problem with it.</p>
<p>City officials plan to hold a special memorial to honor the fallen before kicking off celebrations for Mexico&rsquo;s 200 years of independence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moreno contends the Mexican celebration should not be held on that weekend at all. She and Barbara Coe, who heads the California Coalition for Immigration Reform in Huntington Beach, have sent e-mails to several hundred members involved in the movement, calling for the protests.</p>
<p>Mexican diplomat Alejandra Garcia Williams, who recently took the helm as Consul General in Santa Ana, said she doesn&rsquo;t understand why Moreno and her group would picket her. The city&rsquo;s decision had already been made when she first took charge late last year, she said.</p>
<p>In Mexico and at other consulates throughout the world, she said, the cry for independence celebration officially kicks off late night Sept. 15 and into Sept. 16.</p>
<p>When told about the date of the Santa Ana event, Garcia Williams said she immediately recognized the sensitive nature of Sept. 11 and asked officials to at least have a minute of silence during the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;That day is sensitive also for the Mexican community &hellip;  for the whole world. Mexicans also died in the towers that day,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, she said she didn&rsquo;t object because she was new in town and wanted to be accommodating.</p>
<p>&#8220;But people need to understand that we did not make this decision &hellip; what I attempted to do was to be accommodating to the traditions of Santa Ana to celebrate on the weekend when everyone can attend.&#8221; Garcia Williams said.</p>
<p>Moreno said Garcia Williams should have taken a tougher stance.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is the representative of Mexico. She could still go to the &hellip; City Council and say, &#8216;You know what? Out of respect to your country, we should have it on the weekend after,&rsquo; &#8221; Moreno said. &#8220;She should have spoken up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Too bad they don&rsquo;t wave the Mexican flags at their rallies anymore. That would be like inch-thick icing on the cake.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to get riled up over this.  September 11 is not forevermore a holy day.  Let them celebrate their fest.  Devoting attention to such petty things leaves less time for (and undermines) important things like defending freedom of speech and assembly.  <br>

		<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t the date.  The problem is celebrating Mexican Independence Day here in the United States.  Mexico declared their independence from King Giuseppe Buonaparte, then King of SPAIN.  We declared independence from King George III of the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  Our independence from Britain is the only independence day holiday that should be celebrated in the public sphere here in the United States.  Mexican independence should be celebrated in&hellip;.hmmmm&hellip;..MEXICO!  9-11 has nothing to do with this controversy.</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me a bit. The day of the attack I was working on a construction site and one of the electricians had brought a small television, so we all saw the images as soon as it happened. Naturally we were all stunned, but the most astonishing thing to me was the reaction of the Mexicans, most of whom were illegal aliens. They were positively giddy over the attack. They were laughing and joking all day as if it were some kind of fiesta. I told one young kid who was a naturalized citizen that maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t be so happy, after all, he was of draft age. He told me, with remarkable candor, that he would never fight for the United States but intimated that he would fight against the United States on behalf of Mexico. Since that day, I feel great anger every time I see these people marching and demanding citizenship and health care. Telling us they broke our laws to come here because we need THEM! By the way, in the seven years I worked at that company, I never recieved a single pay increase.  </p>

		<p>Make no mistake - illegal Mexicans and their supporters do not love our country.  They are here to take us for all they can get, and then go home to Mexico where they are considered rich.  So I am not surprised one iota about the total lack of sensitivity or consideration by the Mexicans with regard to 9/11.  They have, as a matter of fact, all the sensitivity of J.R. Salinger&rsquo;s famous toilet seat in &#8220;Catcher in the Rye.&#8221;  They don&rsquo;t care one whit about us - all they want is to get as much money and free services from the USA as they can, and then go home and party (fiesta!).  </p>

		<p>In the first place, a term I constantly come across in articles like these, and one that should never ever be used is anti-illegal immigration group. It makes it sound as if somehow there is a legitimate group for illegal immigration, which their is not a single one. Illegal immigration is a self-explainatory term, and made legitimate by U.S. immigration law.</p>

		<p>Hey Zeus&rsquo; post cannot be ignored, but:<br>
9-11 is indeed not a &#8220;Holy Day.&#8221; If it is also a day when other things happened (like one of the innumerable &#8220;independence days&#8221; of Mestizos, so be it. (they are so innept, they are always having to get &#8220;independent.&#8221; If a drunk bum stumbled into a mexican palace and said &#8220;I&rsquo;m king,&#8221; then the mestizos would be held captive. They can&rsquo;t tie their shoes, and fall endlessly under the violent sway of mere bandits.  Ergo the narco-state.<br>
So forget about 9-11, as far as this goes.<br>
To do otherwise, is to BE PC.<br>
And No AmRenner should be that low, weak or effete.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He told me with remarkable candor&#8221;-Hey Zeus<br>
I had the EXACT same experience with the recent Ft. Hood shootings. When the news came on it had the additional  urgency of happening only dozens of miles away, instead of hundreds. I walked outside to some Hispanic utility workers and told them what was happening and if they had family on the base to get in touch now!! The foreman replied amusedly that he wasn`t American, much less Army. I went back inside with egg on my face and simmering almost to the boiling point&hellip;</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Independence&#8221; day that I pray we&rsquo;ll soon celebrate is independence from Mexico. We, a once-proud nation, the greatest on earth, now is curled into a fetal position and whimpering that &#8220;we can&rsquo;t send 12 million people home.&#8221; Why not? It&rsquo;s come down to them or us. If we want a semblence of what America once was, we need to elect someone who will follow in the footsteps of Dwight Eisenhower, who told the illegals to leave in the 50s. At that time, the men were coming home from war and needed jobs. Now&hellip;15% of the legal population need jobs. Will this President see the need to send illegals packing? Probably not. Like several before him, he feels that adding these criminals to our population is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Sorry Scott, you have it completely wrong:</p>
<p>Sept 11th IS a holy day - a holy day for our side, our cause.</p>
<p>It was the day 300 White NYFD men gave their lives resisting the murder and mayhem of the Non White, Third World immigration of OUR COUNTRY.</p>
<p>This was and is OUR COUNTRY.</p>
<p>Those 300 White NYFD men must be presented as our &#8220;300 Spartans&#8221; who stood up from the dark, hairy hordes from hell, same as the original 300 Spartans stood up to the invading dark, hairy hordes from Persia/Asia.</p>
<p>Whenever I am arguing immigration with some Liberal or worse some idiot, open borders Libertarian know it all, I was bring them back to 9/11/01 and note that I was in New York City when Muslim immigrant terrorists attacked the WTC in 1993.</p>
<p>9/11/01 presents in clear, uncomplicated ways what happens when OUR COUNTRY is invaded by THEM - non White Third World people such as Mohammed Ata.</p>
<p>Do you want to have this horror happen again and again? If not, then WE must control immigration keep THEM OUT.</p>
<p>And the usual smears of &#8220;You&rsquo;re a RACIST&#8221; don&rsquo;t much work when you are presenting THEM as Al Qaeda terrorist.</p>
<p>Yes, Sept 11th is a holy day.</p>

		<p>These ingrates prove once more that they don&rsquo;t care about Americans, their laws, or something as important to us as 9/11. Just one more reason for Obama and his trash-mouth cabinet to make them instant citizens. We&rsquo;ll soon be a nation of American haters. Oh, they will still have their hands out for the goodies our government passes out to them while they&rsquo;re cutting programs for Americans. Insane.</p>

		<p>Hey Zeus: THANK YOU for your observations about the Illegal Mexicans, and how selfish and how  hateful they are towards us! I am going to print up a whole lot of your observations about what the reconquista croud is saying, and distribute them the best way that I can. I hope that more AmRenners will do the same.</p>

		<p>The very same thing happened in our small community in Texas.  Posters were aggresively displayed in libraries and in city departments concerning &#8220;Hispanic Awareness Day&#8221; on September the 11th.  The festival featured cheerful Ballet Folklorica dancers and food stands etc.  I was reeling with anger.</p>
<p>The Hispanic community also took other days that paralleled with our holidays, such as Memorial Day, making it into a huge Mexican festival.  This happened several years ago, and I am happy to report that it has come to a stop.  I must not have been the only one to complain&hellip;and I didn&rsquo;t use threats or violence. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let this kind of thing happen in your community.    </p>

<p>Boy, I never thought I&rsquo;d see that term in the mainstream media, in spite of what the commenter Bobby had to say! Amazing. </p>
<p>I agree with all the comments that say we have a big, big problem brewing in this country with what I like to call our imported fifth-column just ready to turn everything into chaos and mayhem at a moment&rsquo;s notice. God help us all, indeed.</p>

<p>Our government wants to ruin the nation and ruin the environment simultaneously; do you actually believe adding another 100 million people won&rsquo;t change your life?</p>
