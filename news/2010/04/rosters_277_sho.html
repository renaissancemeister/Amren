	<p>The percentage of Major League Baseball players born outside the United {snip} was 27.7% at the start of this season, down from 28% on opening day in 2009.</p>
<p>The MLB commissioner&rsquo;s office said on Tuesday that of the 833 players on rosters at the end of Monday, 231 were born outside the U.S. {snip}</p>

		<p>The Mets GM, Omar Minaya (sp?), was bought in precisely because he&rsquo;s for diversity.   He thinks that by having all these Caribbean Hispanics as players will mean that all the Caribbean Hispanics in the lower boroughs of NYC will be Mets fans for life.  It hasn&rsquo;t quite worked out that way, and the Mets haven&rsquo;t been any good for several years, by the way.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s been an active campaign to recruit Hispanics to Major League Baseball for some time now.  There&rsquo;s also a campaign to get more American Blacks into MLB and it&rsquo;s called &#8216;RBI&rsquo; - Return Baseball to the Inner City.  </p>
<p>Hispanics have long loved the game of baseball and many of these Central American and Caribbean Hispanics are actually a good part &#8216;Black&rsquo; too.  That&rsquo;s not good enough for the promoters of &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; though.  They want American Blacks too.  The problem is that American Blacks&rsquo; interest in Baseball is nowhere near as great as their interest in Football or Basketball.  In any case the idea is to marginalize and get rid of Whites in major sports. &#8216;They&rsquo; want Baseball to eventually be like Football and Basketball, that is, with little or no White representation. The more Black and Hispanic role models there are the more White girls will want to date them and have their babies and the faster the process of the destruction of the White race will proceed.  This is the idea that is behind it, I believe.  </p>

		<p>All these foreign born baseball players must be doing &#8220;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do.&#8221; Either that, or the heads of these teams are no different than the arrogant elites in our government, the media, religious institutions, etc. who view the USA as some sort of multicultural, polyglot empire, &#8216;the first universal nation&rsquo; in which there has to be an unfettered flow &#8216;of goods, services and people.&rsquo; Because there is absolutely no rational basis for hiring foreign athletes to play on US baseball teams in a country with roughly 150 million males. Just do the math; even if a measley 1% of American men have what it takes to play in the big leagues, that still is 1,500,000 guys. And yes that is ONE MILLION, FIVE-HUNDRED THOUSAND. </p>

		<p>The use of performance enhancing drugs is rampant in American professional sports, and in particular in baseball.  This is especially true of Latin American players, where the advantage gained from HGH may be the difference between a multi-million dollar contract and living in complete destitution in a Santo Domingo slum.  To a well-trained eye, it&rsquo;s really quite easy to determine who is on a steady diet of performance enhancing drugs, and a great many Latin sluggers have that telltale swollen face syndrome.       </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care about this &#8220;sport&#8221; either. It is only slightly more exciting than golf and THEN only when a big &#8220;staged&#8221; fight breaks out break the boredom of the fans.</p>

<p>Foreign Talent Loads the Bases in Minor Leagues<br>
More Visas Spur Deals From Haiti to India; Korean Teen Scores Big</p>
<p>&#8220;The surge of young foreign players into the U.S. minor leagues began in 2007, a few months after then-president and former major-league team owner George W. Bush signed the Creating Opportunities for Minor League Professionals, Entertainers and Teams Act, known as the Compete Act. It freed the farm systems of major-league teams from having to compete with all U.S. employers seeking H2B work visas for foreign employees, the supply of which usually was exhausted each year by February. Now, teams can import as many prospects as they want.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no longer a limit on work visas,&#8221; explains Oneri Fleita, the Florida-born director of minor-league development for the Cubs. &#8220;So, yeah, you might see more foreign players getting an opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Cubs, who signed Korea&rsquo;s Hak-Ju Lee right out of high school, have become one of the most aggressive signers of foreign players. In 2006, 86 players in the Cubs&rsquo; major and minor-league system were foreign-born. This year, 142 Cubs are imports.</p>
<p>The changes pose a challenge to American teens hoping to make the big leagues. Instead of signing hundreds of U.S. amateurs out of high school   &mdash;   the traditional business model for stocking minor-league rosters   &mdash;   teams are drafting fewer U.S. kids and signing more so-called nondraft free agents, the vast majority of them teenagers from Latin America.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Baseball, excepting soccer, is the most widely-played sport in the Americas.  Why would anybody be surprised that &#8220;furriners&#8221; from all over the Americas and even Asia are heavily represented on big-league rosters?</p>
<p>At least baseball selection is still purely meritorious and not based on racial or ethnic hiring requirements. If Papua, New Guinea had extraordinarily talented baseball players they&rsquo;d be here too, and deservedly so.</p>

		<p>#1 Question Diversity,</p>
<p>As a long-time devout Mets fan, it is with much pain that I fully agree with the first 2/3 of your statement.  From the beginning of Minaya&rsquo;s tenure, he has been hell-bent on &#8220;Latin-izing&#8221; the Mets (moreso than &#8220;diversifying&#8221;, as the Mets have had only one Black player the past three years).  It is a ploy to make &#8220;Los Mets&#8221; fan-base more Latino, as you said.  In fact, if you look at the Mets 2004 roster (the year before they brought in Minaya), there are only 3 Latino players of the 25 men.  Today in 2010, there are a whopping 13 Latinos, more than half of the team.  </p>
<p>As far as the Mets being competitive, they did come within one game of the World Series in 2006, but Minaya&rsquo;s tenure on the whole (working with the leagues 2nd/3rd highest payroll) has been an unequivocal failure.   </p>

		<p>And who is just now figuring this out? I absolutely love the game. But I haven&rsquo;t watched it in over 10 years because there are very few Americans playing in American Baseball Leagues, and most of those who are are not white. I wouldn&rsquo;t have so much of a problem with all Americans of any color, except as usual, when the percentage of blacks goes up, so does the amount of trouble, cheating, and ghetto behavior. The pureness of the game is lost.</p>
