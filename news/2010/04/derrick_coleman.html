			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Trey Kerby, Yahoo! Sports, April 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s Bankruptcy Beat, [Derrick] Coleman has filed for bankruptcy and owes creditors $4.7 million, most of which he lost in failed attempts to stimulate Detroit&rsquo;s struggling local economy. His lawyer Mark B. Berke explained the reasons for Coleman&rsquo;s financial struggles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Coleman was focused on investing in various communities throughout the city of Detroit by developing real estate, creating jobs and revitalizing business opportunities,&#8221; Berke said. &#8220;Due to the state of the economy, including the decline in the real estate market, Mr. Coleman&rsquo;s investments could not be sustained.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Basketball Reference, Coleman made more than $87 million during his 15 year career with the Nets, 76ers, Hornets, and Pistons. But now he has only about $1 million in assets, including a 1997 Bentley convertible, five fur coats, and $3,000 in jewelry. Not exactly appreciating assets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the filing, Coleman will be trying to keep both his Beverly Hills home, and the home that he bought for his mother, also located in Beverly Hills. Berke says that Coleman is &#8220;just hoping to get rid of that debt and make a fresh start.&#8221;</p>

I thought there is a gentleman even on the way down&hellip;</p>

		<p>I have read that Mr. Coleman purchased whole blocks of delapitated houses and empty plots in Detroit, because he thought he could rejuvenate those neighborhoods.  Evidently, as rich as he once was was as bereft of common sense as he was   &mdash;   Perhaps there was a reason those city blocks in Detroit were so crummy, its houses so run-down or non-existent.  I&rsquo;m hardly the world&rsquo;s brightest person, but I interpret a block full of run-down or non-existent houses as a message that the people in this area aren&rsquo;t worth investing in.  I got the message.  Why couldn&rsquo;t he?</p>

		<p>Wow! He only did the same thing our government at all levels has done&hellip; with the same result! He can, at least, cop a plea that he is a semi-literate athlete who is another product of our failed public school system. And it was his own money, after all. What legitimate excuse does the government have for wasting our tax dollars on the same doomed causes?</p>

<p>Wow, 87 mil.  It&rsquo;s poetic justice, I suppose.  He was paid huge sums for a job less mentally demanding than landscaper or janitor, but all that money wound up right back in the economy where it belonged.</p>

		<p>Although the author is attempting to portray Mr. Coleman as some sort of sound business investor, the fact that he purchased FIVE FUR COATS is more indicative of where his money went.</p>
<p>Since that is still included among his assets, I can only wonder what other superfluous purchases were made that he no longer possesses.  How many millions were wasted on solid gold spinning rims for him and his posse?</p>

		<p>As for me, either the writer was being very politically correct and was dishonest in many sentences in the article, or that I am very sorry for this former NBA athlete.  </p>
<p>He tried to bring a city&rsquo;s economy back to life&hellip;.  and he spent his entire fortune on it, if the writer was honest in this article.  </p>
<p>But it could also depend on the industry&hellip;.  if the industries this man invested in is less than positive&hellip; then I would feel less sorry.  </p>
<p>I just read a few days ago that 60% of all NBA athletes go bankrupt within 5 years after they retire, and 50% go bankrupt within the first 2 years.</p>
<p>This man lost 87 million dollars and currently under 5 million dollars dept?  He spent less foolishly than Scott Pippen&hellip;.  Pippen lost 120 million dollars.  Tyson lost 350 million dollars.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m dying for somebody to compile all these former players who&rsquo;ve gone through tens of millions of dollars into one website. Then tally the number and put it in terms of how many africans could have eaten for however many days. Then show how many africans died of starvation during the same timeframe. Shameful.com maybe?</p>

<p>A finance-expert on Wallstreet said: &#8220;Some people ask me which news and information are important for me and which not. I say every information is important because every information influences the finance-market&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe finance-experts read Amren.<br>
I mean all financial markets bet on white and asian countries but never in African ones. I&rsquo;m sure their is a reason for that. Unlike the government and most lefties, they know exactly what is going on in the world. They see not one African area is doing good. They see all the good companies are doing bad at exactly that time, they are run bye blacks or invest in black areas. Political Correctness is not important when it comes to money. So they do what they think will bring them most money: Invest in Asian or White areas, companies and countries.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t figure out why this story is considered news. Retired black NBA players normally end up squandering their fortunes, ending up penniless.  They&rsquo;re very much the rule, hardly the exception.</p>
<p>A fool and his money are quickly separated, even fools with huge fortunes. </p>

<p>Wrong.  When one wants to do those things, one pays a visit to a broker and buys stock or mutual fund shares.  Coleman spent his money on bling like a Bentley convertible.</p>
