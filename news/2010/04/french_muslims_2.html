<h1>French Muslims Torn Over Potential Veil Ban</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Garriga, AP, April 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Muslims in the Arab world are incensed and Muslims in France are walking a delicate line after President Nicolas Sarkozy pushed for an all-out ban on full Islamic veils.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ridiculous&#8221; and &#8220;misplaced,&#8221; said a Muslim vendor Thursday at an outdoor market in a working class, ethnically mixed Paris suburb. &#8220;Racist,&#8221; said a Sunni Muslim cleric in Lebanon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarkozy upped the stakes Wednesday in France&rsquo;s drive to abolish the all-encompassing veil, ordering a draft law banning them in all public places  &mdash;  defying France&rsquo;s highest administrative body, which says such a ban risks being declared unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Such a measure would put France on the same track as Belgium, which is also moving toward a complete ban amid fears of radicalism and growing Islamic populations in Europe. Sarkozy says such clothing oppresses women and is &#8220;not welcome&#8221; in France. French officials have also cited a concealed face as a security risk.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;France is addressing a very strong message. It is a message on an international level to women. How can we explain that while women are fighting in Afghanistan for their freedom, for their dignity, in France we accept what they are fighting against?&#8221; Morano said on France-Info radio Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Key questions are how the bill will be phrased  &mdash;  whether it will contain exceptions for face-concealing costumes at a Carnival parade, for example  &mdash;  and how a ban would be enforced. The Justice Ministry said Thursday it will write the draft law in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Muslim countries, too, have struggled to deal with the niqab. Egypt&rsquo;s top cleric recently decreed that Muslim women should not wear the niqab inside offices but he said they can wear it in public.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, Sheik Maher Hammoud, a Sunni Muslim cleric in the southern city of Sidon, called the French actions racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever Islamic thought and culture clashes with Western democracy, racism rears its head and under various names,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Muslims do not need lessons from Sarkozy or anyone else to teach them about human rights or the rights of women.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>France drew similar criticism when it outlawed Muslim headscarves and other &#8220;ostentatious&#8221; religious symbols from classrooms in 2004.<br/>

								<h2>Belgium Tries to Ban Muslim Veils in Public</h2>
						<p>Politicians in Brussels are attempting to ban women wearing Islamic veils that cover their faces in public.</p>
<p>If successful, the veil would be outlawed in Belgium  &mdash;  the first European country to ban the niqab and burkha.</p>
<p>The garments, though traditionally worn by some Islamic women when in public, are not a mandatory religious requirement for Muslims.</p>
<p>But if passed, the law would mean that anyone wearing a face veil or full body garment in the street could face a 15 to 25 euros fine (£13 to £21), or even a week in jail.</p>
<p>Nicolas Sarkozy has also called for a similar ban on veiled women in France despite opposition and advice that such a ban may be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the French government said: &#8220;Wearing a full veil is a sign of a community closing in on itself and of a rejection of our values.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Sarkozy, who is married to former model Carla Bruni, told his Cabinet the veil was an &#8220;assault on women&rsquo;s dignity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Abdellatif Lemsibak, a member of the National Federation of Muslims of France, said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a transgression, an aggression even, on the level of personal liberty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though there have been suggestions of implementing veil bans in the UK the idea has so far been rejected.</p>
<p>When asked about a ban earlier this year, Justice Secretary Jack Straw said: &#8220;I do not believe that this is a matter which should be the subject of the criminal law in which we were expecting the police to remove these items of apparel from women who choose for religious or cultural reasons to wear them.&#8221;<br/>

<p>Correction, Charlie.  Muslims DO NEED lessons about human rights.</p>
<p>What you meant to say is that Muslims don&rsquo;t want to hear anything about their unjust treatment of their people&hellip;and animals&hellip;.which is excused by their third world religion. <br/>

<p>Oh, and I thought Islam was a religion, not a race. There are even white people who are Muslims. Muslims comprise almost half the population Bosnia and Herzegovina, a white country in Europe. Albania is a Muslim country, another white nation in Europe.</p>
<p>Anyway, I applaud the French for taking measures against the Islamization of their nation. Full Islamic veils are atavistic and have no place in these modern times.</p>

<p>And the women of those countries do not wear the all concealing clothing. They are the only forward thinking muslims I know (I work with many of them) but I still wouldn&rsquo;t bet on them not joining jihad if pushed!</p>

		<p>Seems to me we&rsquo;ve been here before.  Wearing of veils and burkhas are security risks, pure and simple.  I really don&rsquo;t care WHAT religion someone is unless they try to pull a fast one by concealing weapons or bombs under their clothing in the name of their religion, which is exactly what Muslims do.  It is incumbent upon ALL Muslims to practice jihad against infidels (non-Muslims), regardless of location.  So I see both France and Belgium as simply protecting their citizens from serious harm by outlawing veils and burkhas.</p>

		<p>The French state is in psychological denial over the reality of its intractable and insoluble muslim problem.<br/>
 On the one hand, the French political class, deep down, realises that they have lost control of their ancient nation and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the alien element in their midst exerts complete demographic, political and legal control of France.<br/>
 The method the French political class has chosen to deal with this unpalatable fact is the classic neurosis of &#8216;denial&rsquo; ie a conscious or unconscious wish avoid the terrifying reality by pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist.<br/>
 This is coupled, perversly, by another deep psychological urge, the &#8216;ecstasy of disavowal&rsquo; ie the almost sexual enjoyment leading French polticians get by denouncing, hating, humiliating and generally persecuting any genuine White activist seeking to remedy the terrifying truth.<br/>
 Perhaps I&rsquo;m over-larding the pop-psychology, but in an individual such mental conflict would be labelled as schizophrenic.<br/>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>This really amounts to almost nothing. It is hardly even scratching the surface. A joke!  Sarkozy is BY NO MEANS resisting the Islamization of France. Here in Paris one sees the Islamization everywhere, going on all around us, veils or no veils.  Even without veils, it will  continue to proceed. Nothing meaningful is being done to halt it.     </p>
<p>Personnally, I think he is just making a timely political ploy to capture away some of the right-wing votes from the Front National which is again making a strong come-back. French elections are approaching, and Sarkozy is above all a cunning politician.</p>
<p>As Kenelm Digby says above (#6), the French political class is/are in denial.  Exactly!  &#8220;On the one hand, [they] deep down, realise that they have lost control of their ancient nation and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the alien element in their midst exerts complete demographic, political and legal control of France.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Like anybody who&rsquo;s in denial, they don&rsquo;t want to hear the bad news and they punish the messenger.   As one who&rsquo;s on the scene observing this tragic historical phenomenon first hand, I could not possibly agree more with what Digby has written. He describes it perfectly, every word.  And it&rsquo;s not even possible to discuss the matter here! It&rsquo;s not even easy to get Amren online&hellip; usually a forbidden website. (Soon coming to America?)  Yesterday, just for curiousity, I tried NAACP, ADL, SPLC - and they were ALL readily accessible - but NOT Amren or any other white-oriented site (such as VDare).  Today, I was able. </p>
<p>I hate to say it, but am coming to believe that France is further gone than the USA.  Analyzing it, here (in France) they face a two-pronged threat, not a single one. It is not just racial, it is also religious/cultural. That dual problem does not exist to the same degree in the US (yet).  (Many Moslems here are completely white - some just as white as I am - I&rsquo;m not saying most, but there are many.)</p>
<p>Added to that, there is the further fact that in France the degree of (racial)  mixing and assimilation has gone much farther than it has in the US  (speaking of blacks now, but it could apply to Moslems too).  In the US, we may have more blacks, but we have generally kept to separate worlds.  We have not traditionally socialized with them and married with them so casually as the French have. Thus, their penetration of French society has been much more pervasive than in America. That greatly complicates things in France. In the USA you&rsquo;re not likely to see a happy grandpa out for an evening walk, pushing his mulatto toddler in a stroller, as I saw just last night   &mdash;   a not unusual sight here at all.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had Muslims dislike me after I told them I am an atheist and believe in the theory of evolution. I wasn&rsquo;t preaching to them or constantly harping about it. It was a just little admission in a conversation. This has happened twice and there was a coldness directed toward me afterwords. I think it is in the Koran that Muslims shun non-believers. I&rsquo;ve had Christians object to my beliefs but there seems to be more of an &#8220;agree to disagree&#8221; ethic between Christians and atheists. I think the debate has occured in many families and we&rsquo;ve learned to live with it; not so with Muslims. Maybe it&rsquo;s time for the French government to deal with this type of discrimination which I&rsquo;m sure has happened to many Frenchmen. I would never work for a Muslim boss for fear of bias. In conversing with Muslims I only say what is needed and would never have a rambling friendly chat like I would with a white or Christian person. </p>

<p>**************************</p>
<p>Islam makes special allowance for &#8220;People of the Book&#8221; (Jews &amp; Christians);  it considers that they are at least &#8220;coming along&#8221; on the right path to Islam&hellip;.it&rsquo;s just going to take them a while to see the light.</p>
<p>Islam regards people who worship many gods (ploytheists) as extremely wicked and worthless, fit only for conversion or enslavement (or death).  But Atheists who worship NO gods, it must consider totally worthless   &mdash;   the worst of the worst, beyond the pale, people deserving of no quarter. </p>
<p>That would explain their attitude.</p>
<p>There must be many modern Frenchmen who are not believers (of any faith).  They naively take for granted that they are, in time, going to win these Muslims over and make good liberal Frenchmen out of them.  Little do they realize that the Muslims intend to take over and make good Muslims out of THEM!  Or else.</p>

<p>   I agree with you Mr. Digby. Banning the Abaya/Chador is not going to change anything. In fact, it may make France&rsquo;s already restive Muslim minority more so. Rates of immigration and reproduction among Muslims are making such efforts largely symbolic anyway. Sarkozy has never been serious about dealing with the roots of France&rsquo;s immigration problems.</p>

<p>True, there is no place for Rights in Islam, and the women are regarded as humanoid livestock. </p>
<p>The concept of every citizen having Rights that governments are forced to respect is a White male value. When White men are gone so will Rights, and there will be no legal constraints on governenments for Women or anybody else.</p>

		<p>This is a political maneuvre on Sarkozy&rsquo;s part, designed to distract the electorate and win votes from the Right. <br/>
According to a new survey, he now has only a 31% approval rating, whilst those discontent with him  have reached a record level of 68%.   <br/>
Meanwhile, the Front National is making a strong come-back.<br/>

		<p>The muslims are flexible in their pursuit of their agenda..example! they changed their HISTORIC prayer days from Thursday and Friday to Friday and Saturday..They did so because they (the Kuwaitis) did the math and saw how much money was being lost in interest by being closed on a bank day. So suddenly, Allah can have prayers on a different HISTORIC day. In the meantime, they will comply, or at least APPEAR to comply, with most any laws or rules that the West thinks will curtail the muslim threat. They will remain compliant until their numbers are sufficient to challenge the government, and then THEY WILL!</p>
