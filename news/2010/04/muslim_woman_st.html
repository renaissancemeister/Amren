			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Shears, Daily Mail (London), April 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A young Muslim woman had died after her burkha became snagged in a go-kart.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old woman, who has not yet been named, died a terrifying death today when a fluttering part of her burkha became caught in the wheels of a go-kart she was driving near the town of  Port Stephens, north of Sydney.</p>
<p>The Muslim clothing the woman was wearing flew back as she sped around the track and part of it became entangled in the go-kart&rsquo;s wheels.</p>
<p>She was strangled in a second and crashed the vehicle.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of paramedics who rushed to her aid, the neck and throat injuries she suffered were so severe that doctors were unable to revive her when she arrived at the John Hunter Hospital in the New South Wales city of Newcastle.</p>
<p>The young woman was riding the go-kart at a popular recreational area known as Bob&rsquo;s Farm, which offers rides of up to 15 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>Her death is being likened to that of American dancer Isadora Duncan, acknowledged as being the creator of modern dance, and who was famous for the flowing silk carves she liked to wear.</p>
<p>But while riding in an open-top car in Nice in 1927, her scarf became  entangled in one of the vehicle&rsquo;s spoked wheels and she was strangled.<br>

		<p>&#8216;Her neck and throat injuries..&rsquo; Just as an interesting aside, I read  somewhere that in my State of residence a sucker punch full force to the face could and would be construed as a misdemeanor assault or battery but any grabbing of the throat and/or choking an assailant is classified as a State jail felony. Guess it has to do with the danger of constricting or cutting off someone`s air supply.</p>

		<p>Modern dance pioneer Isadora Duncan died when her scarf got caught in the wheels of a 1920s roadster.</p>
<p>As for this Muslim woman, the word &#8220;hapless&#8221; comes to mind. She had no business even being in England, but&hellip;did she create Britain&rsquo;s immigration policy that brought her there? No, it was made by race-traitor white politicians. Often we think of ethnic adversaries as the originators of immigration problems. In fact they are just opportunists who take advantage of open borders. So as a Christian, I ask God to bless this poor woman&rsquo;s soul. The problem, in Britain &amp; America, is the poltical elite which advocates white destruction.   </p>

		<p>It seems pretty obvious to me that if you&rsquo;ve got a long flowing robe or scarf, you shouldn&rsquo;t be getting in a go-cart. It seems these burkhas were deliberately designed to hobble women. </p>
<p>Because they drag, they get soiled easily, they are harder to put on and wear, and the narrow eye openings can severely cut down on visibility. They proclaim rather loudly &#8220;Your place as a woman is to be subservient to men,&#8221; and yet the left has no problem with them.</p>

		<p>I see a law suit of some sort appearing. Like the Kart track owner should have fully enclosed wheels and shields over everything that turns to &#8220;accomodate&#8221; muslims. The world is all about &#8220;accomodating&#8221; muslims&hellip;I say all muslims out of civilized countries.</p>

		<p>I always wondered about the garments worn by our muslim &#8220;friends.&#8221;  Have you ever noticed that the women&rsquo;s garments are always black, and the men&rsquo;s garments are always white?  Besides the obvious symbolic significance of it, you also wonder because of the sheer heat of the environment.  It&rsquo;s hot as hell in the middle east, and white reflects heat, whereas black captures it.  The burka is simply punishment.</p>

		<p>If this unfortunate woman was conservative enough to wear a burkha, I assume she was accompanied by her husband or another male relative.  If so, it seems odd that he allowed her to do something as potentially undignified and unladylike as riding an amusement park ride.  And the next thing she might have done was drive a car all by herself!!</p>

		<p>Isadora Duncan. The famous American dancer, who &#8220;invented&#8221; modern dance, died in such an accident. Isadora was noted for wearing long scarves. Such a scarf became entangled during a &#8220;motor&#8221; event and she was strangled to death. This was the era when an automobile was called a &#8220;motor&#8221;.</p>
<p>I used to have Pakistani women living across the street from me. They would wear the long robes and scarves ehen cutting the grass with a power lawn mower. I told them to beware and not get that long flowing apparal caught in the bladed apparatus or it would be &#8220;curtains&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It is not just the danger of entanglement, but those blankets over the head with the tiny eye slit has to really limit one&rsquo;s vision. </p>
<p>A lot of those burkas even have screens over the tiny eye slit to ensure that not even the tiniest speck of skin is exposed, it would be like trying to drive with a blanket over your head. This might explain why in Saudi Arabia women are forbidden from driving  &mdash;  the highways would be littered with burka clad corpses from constant car wrecks.<br>

		<p>I used to work at a go-kart manufacturer.  There was a wall where they hung karts that were involved in injuries, keeping them as evidence in case of lawsuits.  The wrecks were always caused by stupidity, usually drinking.  We called it the Trophy Room.  </p>

<p>And the women wear gloves and sungalsses over the eyes in some cases so flesh or eyes cannot be seen. And slippers only, no shoes with heels. The clicking a womans heels make might make a man THINK about woman. We just could not have that!</p>

		<p> Have you ever noticed that the women&rsquo;s garments are always black, and the men&rsquo;s garments are always white?</p>
<p>Not quite correct, no offense intended. In Kuwait particularly, a woman&rsquo;s abayaa may be a number of colors though black is dominant. They are also very often tailor made, VERY form revealing clothing which displays the girls figures very well and decorated with some really beautiful embroidery or jewelery work. The men I have seen wear the Dashdashta in WHITE, BLACK, YELLOW, GRAY, BROWN and once in multicolors!! I do not know if there is any particular meaning to colors, but I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
