			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, Alternative Right, April 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote><i>This is the first in a series of articles on the question, raised most publicly by Patrick Buchanan, whether the Tea Party movement nurtures white consciousness and unity and will become the political basis for whites as a people.</i> </blockquote>
<p>Unlike Pat Buchanan, I do not think the Tea Party movement marks the emergence of a new, white ethnonationalism. At the end of his recent article on the subject, Buchanan himself backs away from this prediction, conceding that the conflict that gave rise to the movement &#8220;is not so much racial as it is cultural, political and tribal.&#8221; The politicians Tea Partiers admire most are Sarah Palin, who has the racial consciousness of a fried egg, and Ron Paul, who flirted with heterodoxy years ago, but now claims to have put all that behind him.</p>
<p>The racial significance of attending a Tea Party is not much different from going to the opera or a Renaissance festival: Virtually everyone there is white, and most like it that way but would never admit it  &mdash;  not even to themselves. Tea parties, just like opera companies, fret over their whiteness and claim to want to cure it.</p>
<p>Other more promising movements have come and gone without giving rise to ethno-nationalism. The militias and the Minuteman border patrols were far more likely than Tea Parties to attract racial free thinkers, but they never talked about race. Their leaders threw out anyone who did.</p>
<p>The Left detects &#8220;racism&#8221; whenever whites gather and for whatever reason: Tea Partiers, Daughters of the American Revolution, Republicans, suburbanites, country clubbers, NASCAR fans, etc. Some people even complain that Star Trek conventions are too white. What the Left is detecting is only its own propaganda; there is no racial consciousness in these groups. They are not a sign of ethnonationalism, nor will they be until their organizers and participants are prepared to say, &#8220;Yes, we&rsquo;re white, and we like it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buchanan compares the Tea Party movement to the breakup of the Soviet Union along ethnic lines. Until Tea Partiers are prepared to echo the motto of the Vlams Belang Flemish-identity political party in Belgium  &mdash;  Eigen volk eerst! (Our people first!)  &mdash;  that comparison is fantasy. The motto of the Tea Party Patriots, &#8220;fiscal responsibility, limited government, and free markets,&#8221; is hardly a celebration of ethnic identity.</p>
<p>For racial consciousness to have political consequences, it must be as explicit and unapologetic as that of the Congressional Black Caucus and the National Council of La Raza. That is what it will take for whites to survive as a distinct people with a distinct culture, but tea partiers do not have even the vocabulary to think in those terms, much less the backbone to act on them.</p>
<p>Whites are schizophrenic about race. When it matters to them personally, they can be shockingly illiberal. They clear out when the neighborhood turns Mexican or the public school turns black, and they do this whatever their politics. As Joe Sobran has noted, in their mating and migratory habits, liberals are no different from members of the Klan. But virtually no whites admit race has anything to do with this, and they claim not to care if the whole country goes black and Mexican.</p>
<p>Immigration and high non-white birthrates are turning ever-larger parts of the America into those very places where whites refuse to live, but once they have escaped from the joys of diversity, and found a little patch of homogeneity, whites forget why they moved. This deluded state of mind is now at least 50 years old, and is only slowly crumbling. Don&rsquo;t expect a speaker at a Tea Party rally to point out the contradiction between wanting &#8220;good&#8221; schools, &#8220;safe&#8221; neighborhoods, and &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>I applaud the tea partiers&rsquo; opposition to big government and to Obama&rsquo;s leftist politics. The country will need them if Obama is to be stopped after a single term. But they will not be an incipient ethno-nationalist movement until they dump Sarah Palin and make Patrick Buchanan their champion.</p>

<p>I was in complete agreement until this sentence.  Pat Buchanan has yet to become anything resembling a pro-White leader.  True, he gingerly brushes the topic from time to time, but then immediately recoils from it.  One step forward, one step back.  He may secretly agree with us, but until he comes unequivocally out of the closet and declares himself pro-White, he&rsquo;s not ready to be anybody&rsquo;s &#8220;champion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The closest we have at this moment to a genuine White leader is Jared Taylor himself.<br>

		<p>I consider myself a Tea Party member. I should point out that Sarah Palin claims to be &#8220;in&#8221; with the tea partiers, and the mainstream media makes it appear that way, but she is in fact a shill for John McCain, who is despised in tea party circles, and many of us know that. I should also point out that it was people like us who deluged Congress when they tried to pass amnesty for illegal aliens in 2006 and 2007, and who are trying to shove McCain out of Congress as we speak.</p>
<p>True, explicity white racial consciousness would turn many tea partiers off. But they are sympathetic to complaints about affirmative action and their effect on white males especially. I don&rsquo;t know what it would take to give them a final shove in that direction, but it seems possible to me.</p>

<p>The neocons are quivering in orgasmic ecstacy at the thought of these Tea Party tools voting them back into power.  Small government and less taxes is fine but use some common sense when voting for politicians and don&rsquo;t just pull the lever for anyone just to get rid of that Democrat (or Republican) Congressman. Their masters have given them carte blanche to promise you the world because they know you&rsquo;re on borrowed time and all they need to do is run the clock out on third world immigration.  You can tell who is pulling their puppet strings by their foreign policy stand.  Think of the self-proclaimed leader of the Tea Party, Sarah Palin, as a ventriloquist dummy with a gnarled rat like claw of a hand up its backside.  </p>

		<p>Pat Buchanan, yea Pat&rsquo;s a good man; he will be on CSPAN live next Sunday afternoon.  But just as the Tea Party people must recognize that they are white and have an interest as white people; but they do  not. Well, so too, Pat should have used his position to publicize the attack on the AR conference.  But he did not.<br>
I guess that he didn&rsquo;t do that  means we need new young people that can reach the public. Young people that can take chances.  Maybe, they can do something with the tea party people.</p>

		<p>I agree. I don&rsquo;t think the Tea Party Movement is racially conscious or ever will be, despite the obvious high hopes of many white nationalists. Even so, the media is having a hissyfit about them nevertheless. In my local area, a tea party activist was bashed by the Chicago news because she had the temerity to have her picture taken near some rather impertinent signs, including one that said (gasp!) &#8220;Got rope?&#8221; If this is the display that the media puts on regarding a non-racial movement, imagine the outrage if there were a white movement as big as the Tea Party that really was racial! So I can&rsquo;t really blame the Tea Party Movement for buckling under. The best that can be said about the Tea Party is that they might pave the way for a separate, more racially conscious movement in the future. Maybe that is what the MSM is so afraid of. </p>

		<p>This is all true of course. The only ones who see anything racial at all in the TP movement are its enemies on the left! The Partiers themselves are embarrassed, horrified even at the mere suggestion that theirs is a movement that even acknowledges race, let alone celebrates it. I said much the same thing over at Alt-Right - I really believe Pat has read way too much into the whiteness of the TP movement. I would that he were correct regarding a burgeoning white tribal solidarity afoot, but I fear this just isn&rsquo;t even remotely the case     </p>

		<p>As I mentioned in an earlier posting on this matter, White Americans are just too cowardly to ever turn the so-called Tea Party Movement into a broadbased movement on reviving White racial consciousness.  It&rsquo;s sad to say, but true.</p>
<p>I also regret having to say this, but I have to agree with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  As soon as things start turning around in this country, economically speaking, watch how fast the bulk of Tea Partiers lose interest in the whole thing.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve gone to a couple of the larger events, and support them in spirit, but I&rsquo;d have to agree with your statement that </p>
<p>&#8220;Tea parties, just like opera companies, fret over their whiteness and claim to want to cure it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what has turned me off to the tea parties - the desperate bending over backward to be, above all else - &#8216;non-racist&rsquo;. If they weren&rsquo;t at all racially concious, I&rsquo;d be supportive of them just for what they do promote. </p>
<p>But to be racially self-concious and apologetic is more than I can stand in a &#8216;new movement&rsquo;. Watching the tea party types scramble for a &#8216;black conservative&rsquo; (4% or so?) to &#8216;vouch&rsquo; for their PC-credentials is nauseating. If I&rsquo;m going to rally to a cause, it isn&rsquo;t going to be apologizing to anybody. </p>

		<p>Quite right.  The Tea Party movement is spot-on when it comes to most legs of their platform (if their is a single platform).  But they are no less embarrassingly groveling than anyone else when it comes to race.  And that is exactly why they will fail: diversity is anathema to limited government, fiscal responsibility, Bill of Rights, fair taxation, immigration sanity, States rights &amp; local control, constitutional judiciary practices, and checks and balances.  And Sarah Palin is way too much of an unprincipled opportunist bookstore Christian to ever realize any of that.  If the Tea Party adopts Pat Buchanan, on the other hand, it may amount to something someday.</p>

		<p>Jared is the only one that appears to be able to see clearly, in regard to white racial consciousness, these days.  I agree with him even though it deeply disturbs me.  I see his analogies in my own friends and family.  They just don&rsquo;t have the courage to even save themselves.<br>

		<p>I read Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s article about the Tea Party movement and a possible rise in white racial consciousness. I believed from the onset that it was just wishful thinking, so I totally agree with the author of this article.</p>
<p>I also agree with his idea that Sarah Palin shouldn&rsquo;t be a leader of the Tea Party movement, whether there&rsquo;s a racial element to it or not. I&rsquo;m sure most of us have seen her embarrassing interview in which she cited Alaska&rsquo;s proximity to Russia as foreign policy experience. Sorry, but she just isn&rsquo;t too bright.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a member of Tea Party Nation, and I didn&rsquo;t join because I&rsquo;m white.  As a matter of fact, that never entered my mind.  I joined because I agree with most of the Tea Parth positions, and whiteness is a by-product.  The fact is, the Tea Party folks are about VALUES.  Anybody who shares our values is welcome to join.  It may end in a sort of de facto segregation, but that was not anyone&rsquo;s conscious intent.  I&rsquo;m OK with it either way.  I just want B.O. and his marxists OUT of our government ASAP.</p>

		<p>At this point in time the TEA parties don&rsquo;t  need to use white ethno-nationalism to get the message out since lower taxes and smaller govt appeal largely to whites. Bantus and Hispanics are the biggist user&rsquo;s of govt programs. The TEA parties are also opposed to illegal immigration. Thats all the ethno-nationalism they need at the present. This could all change over time as the<br>
left tries to demonize the TEA parties. I don&rsquo;t trust Sarah Palin<br>
she wants a path too citizenship for illegal invaders enough said.</p>

		<p>Well said!</p>
<p>The Tea Party is anti-tax at its heart.  They are not as a group, racially aware.  The fact that neither they, nor even one major political party in the USA talk of demographic change (from White to non-White) as a catastrophic event is telling.</p>
<p>The Tea Party is probably less racist than the Democratic party of today.  The only reason you don&rsquo;t see many non-Whites is because they are calling for an end to Welfare and similar programs that rob the rich and give to the poor.</p>
<p>The Neo-Cons who are taking it over will likely change that.</p>

		<p>CofCC.org posted links to both columns and has great polls concerning the TEA Party movement. It shoudl be pointed out that I have been to TEA parties in two major cities and there is a huge difference depending on who is organizing it. I&rsquo;ve seen the let&rsquo;s all grovel to the media and everyone go out a recruit a black person TEA party, and the hard-core right-wing in your face, semi racial TEA Party rally.</p>
<p>Anyway. Please check out the polls concerning the TEA Party rallies at https://cofcc.org/2010/04/tea-parties-and-whiteness-by-jared-taylor/ and tell us what you think and what your involvement level in the TEA Party movement is!</p>

 I just want to know why these things are hushed-up, but this guy at the rally literally called me a &#8220;birther&#8221; and dismissed my question like to a child. Since then I see the Palin out here stumping for John McCain - a total sell-out on immigration, now beating his chest for it, no shame to his game - Anyway, the figure-head of the tea party is promoting the guy who tried to shove amnesty down our throats?<br>
 I don&rsquo;t think the original cast of the Boston Tea Party had these ideals when they were at it.</p>

		<p>Sarah Palin is important to the tea party movement at this point in time while the group is establishing itself as a unified entity.  She is able to bring whites together and that&rsquo;s the only thing that is important right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never going to be a white conscious movement of any size or power, as in Europe.  Not so long as the left controls the organs of communications so greatly.  </p>
<p>The important thing right now is to get whites up off the couches and turn them into advocates and unite even if race isn&rsquo;t remotely involved, whether it&rsquo;s a tea party, a militia, a neighborhood watch group, or whatever.</p>
<p>When the situation turns racial&hellip;.AND IT WILL&hellip;.whites will already be united and have good organizations and lines of communications in place.</p>
<p>My guess is that black rioting and violence&hellip;.sometime after the next economic downturn&hellip;. eventually leading to armed conflict with Hispanics, will be the starting gun to large scale social upheaval.  At that time, pretenses in white groups will drop and whites will be forced to be as racially united as blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>The important thing is to get whites organized and united.  Everything else will deterorate all on its own just as it has been doing.  Look at how racially aware people are now compared to pre-Obama.  Those racial divisions will intensify greatly.</p>

They aren&rsquo;t even smart enough to realize that medicare IS a government program.  Along with all that, and more, it has been revealed that large insurance companies and other corporate lobbies have been the big financiers of the &#8220;Tea Party Movement.&#8221;  Nothing is sacred and everything is exploited.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I KNOW this nation is dead.  The most motivated of conservative people are a bunch of dumbed down, know nothings, who can be easily manipulated into supporting corporations that only want to make more money off them.  I think they have cheapened and even rendered the national flag, and the Gadsen flag even more meaningless with such a pseudo-patriotic scam campaign.</p>
<p>I can feel the count down to chaos.  I think we are going to start seeing national break down sooner than we think.</p>

		<p>Jared&rsquo;s article certainly rings true.  I myself was hoping that a smidgen of White racial consciousness might turn up in the Tea Party movement, but it does not seem likely.  Whites seem hell-bent on being nice and politically correct - even if it kills them.  And it may - literally.</p>

		<p>From going to Tea Party-affiliated blogs and websites, from what I can tell, these people&rsquo;s primary reason for existence is to prove that they are not &#8220;racist.&#8221;  They like to pretend that charges of racism don&rsquo;t matter to them and that they are so politically-incorrect, but this couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. </p>
<p>I usually follow any type of right-wing political movement very closely, but sometime when I wasn&rsquo;t looking, these Tea Party folks wrote their own version of history which millions of Tea Partiers have accepted as the absolute truth and will defend to the death.  In this version of history, black is white, good is evil, and up is down.  These people actually believe that &#8220;racism&#8221; in any form is liberalism, that the Nazis were a left-wing political movement, that MLK was a conservative, that Democrats are &#8220;racist&#8221; towards blacks and other minorities and that, somehow, this is why they provide them with as much free stuff as possible, that interracial dating is conservative because true conservatives don&rsquo;t care about race, etc. These people spout your typical left-wing drivel on race, but believe that this has actually been the conservative position all along.   They will tell you that the great &#8220;conservative&#8221; Lincoln liberated the slaves from the evil, left-wing slave owners in the South, that conservatives passed the Civil Rights Act over the objections of &#8220;liberal&#8221; white Southerners, and that the K was founded as a left-wing, &#8220;progressive&#8221; organization.  I really cannot wrap my head around it. </p>
<p>I have gone to their sites and posted rather tame comments mentioning that the GOP is doomed to political failure unless it addresses the demographic decline of white America.  For stating basic race-realist ideas, Tea Partiers have called me &#8220;racist&#8221;, &#8220;Nazi&#8221;, &#8220;socialist&#8221;, &#8220;communist&#8221;, &#8220;liberal&#8221;, &#8220;idiot&#8221;, and my favorite - &#8220;George Soros-paid troll.&#8221;  I have also been told on numerous occasions that I have mental health issues and that someone has to be insane to believe that there are any genetic differences between the races.  These people are beyond hope.</p>

		<p>Though they are forbidden to speak of it, TPs must be at least as racist as liberals are.  They like White society, and don&rsquo;t like Blacks or Mexicans well enough to move in next to them.   They are, just like the multi-culties say, closet racists.  Mass gatherings of Whites, for any reason, have the potential for developing racial consciousness, because the people already have a racial subconscious.  The TP Leaders are on their guard against any such outbreak, but it won&rsquo;t be us who finally lift the scales from out brethren&rsquo;s eyes, but the Blacks and Mexicans.  Things seem to be heating up in Arizona.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that Pat Buchanan has great difficulty in getting away from the &#8216;elites&rsquo; to which it seems he is a member.  He writes one way but when he is on any of those talk shows, Chris Matthews, e.g., for instance, he becomes more subdued when he is around his peers.  Maybe that&rsquo;s the way he has to act in order to be invited onto these programs, but I wish that when he is a guest on them, that he become more like the author Pat Buchanan.  I still can&rsquo;t figure why when he ran as a presidential candidate, that he chose a Black woman as a running mate.  Who dictated that? Was it his sister? I think Pat Buchanan should break away from the elites in the media and &#8216;tell it like it is&rsquo; if he really believes in what he writes about.  Until I hear Sarah Palin tell the crowds that she wants to end affirmative action and other racial set-asides that discriminate against white males, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d trust her.  The same for the talking heads on radio and TV, Sean Hannity, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, et al. Why do whites praise someone like Bill Gates whose charity extends only to non-whites and excludes Caucasians from his college scholarship fund? Whites should be bombarding their representatives in Congress about these evil policies that discriminate against the white population of this country, especially white males.</p>

There is no National Tea Party headquarters that prints membership cards and application blanks.  That can be a good thing (for us), and simultaneously a bad thing (it makes it far easier for leftist agitator kooks.)</p>
<p>The only real organization I know of affiliated with the TPM is the Tea Party Express, but I would avoid them b/c even most Tea Partiers think that there&rsquo;s a lot of neo-con astroturfing going on there.</p>

		<p>I think the TP is with us. I say that because it has a life of its own now. The established parties and media are desparate to label them as anything. Racist if you will. But the people are just moving and nobody is in control which is what the establishment fears the most. Because they can&rsquo;t sit down at a nice table and go about co-opting a leadership with give and take. All political groups are running to catch up to the TP, but they don&rsquo;t know how to do it. They&rsquo;re chasing something with no leadership that is going to speak in November and they&rsquo;re scared stiff.</p>

		<p>TP&rsquo;ers are just a bunch of delusional, racially unaware dupes who cannot connect the problems in America today with the ever growing nonwhite population. Why do they even think there is a BIG government, high taxes and hand outs to begin with? I have to laugh when I hear these neocon talk show hosts talk about how the TP&rsquo;ers are such true patriots. They are so afraid of being called racists that they quake in their boots whenever it is thrown at them.

<p>Maybe some things are best unsaid.</p>
<p>When a young man dates a young woman, he does NOT say, &#8220;This romance thing is just window dressing for what I really want. I want to impregnate you so that my genes can continue.&#8221; But he romances her  &mdash;  it is part of the game.</p>
<p>When an organization hires a person to work for them, they do NOT say, &#8220;We want to get every cent out of you. We don&rsquo;t really care about your personal life. We will use you to make money for us.&#8221; But they do care, or pretend to  &mdash;  it is part of the game.</p>
<p>When a church recruits members, it does NOT say, &#8220;We need your money. And then we need you to go out and get more members, so that they can give money and go out and get more members. And, by the way, your soul is important to us.&#8221; But they do provide fellowship and security  &mdash;  it is part of the package.</p>
<p>There are probably many examples of the polite social lubrication that we apply to the wheels of civilization. <br>
I am not saying that it is all false, or all sincere. Like most things, it is a &#8220;razor&rsquo;s edge&#8221; thing, a balancing act between our needs and our concern for others. </p>
<p>Maybe if an orgization pursues excellence, truth, morality, decorum, etc. it will just shake out that it ends up mostly White? And if it does attract others, they will be at a high intelligence level.</p>
<p>Maybe if Whiteness is promoted firstly, you would end up with skinhead types?</p>
<p>It is said that Europeans did not write down laws of morality because they did not have to  &mdash;  they had an instinctive hearfelt conviction of what was right. Perhaps Whiteness is the same? We do not have to write it down, we do not even have to say it (out loud) but we KNOW it. And it does get said &hellip; in small, quiet sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Being White by itself is not, IMO, a reliable criterion.  White people have done too many bad things to me and my family.</p>

<p>Why can&rsquo;t anybody see that?</p>

		<p>People are too hard on both Buchanan and the Tea Party.</p>
<p>We live under de facto fascism.  Anyone who violates the party line is viciously attacked.  If they live away from centers of liberalism, the attack is slanderous and usually involves trying to destroy their reputation and livlihood.  If they live anywhere near minorities, it&rsquo;s death threats and murder.</p>
<p>My point is, the first people who stick their necks out get their heads chopped off.  A rather large percentage of whites have figured it out but are not prepared to act&hellip;.yet.</p>
<p>Instead, you will see little drips and drabs of racial consciousness on display as certain people quietly position themselves in power.  The task of people who understand what is going on is to correctly identify and support these people.  Encourage others to vote for them without insisting the race issue be made too overt.  Then, when they are in place, the time to go mainstream will come.</p>
<p>A good example of what I am talking about it Ron Paul.  He&rsquo;s a closet white nationalist that has sanitized his past and disavowed these things.  Did he have a change of heart?  Did he jump ship and join the other side?  I find that unlikely.  Look at his agenda.  Everything he works toward chips away at the power base maintaining the current racist anti-white fascism we are experiencing&hellip;..without ever mentioning that it.  This is a stealth candidate.  Someone who KNOWS what is going on but also understands that, until he has real power, he can&rsquo;t come out into the open lest the opposition destroy him.</p>
<p>There are others.  Some more obvious than others.  The way to discover who they are is look at their behavior and ignore their rhetoric.</p>
<p>And to those that say the tea party is just another neocon puppet, understand that the whole focus of the movement is replacing GOP candidates who work for Obama&rsquo;s masters, with those who don&rsquo;t.  They may make a show of putting on a diverse face but look at what their candidates want to do.  </p>
<p>The most telling issue is what they want to do about immigrants.</p>

		<p>Gentlemen, please resist the &#8220;Genetic&#8221; fallacy. The origins of a statement are no guide to its truth or falsity. The Tea Parties are proposing good economic and taz policy.  The Minutemen are correct on the need for border defense. Classical liberalism has proven to be the least bad system for political economy yet discovered. None of this has to do with who discovered them first. Everyone benefits from them who have tried them - except those who wish to be World Controllers. This class&rsquo; power hunger has been so blatantly revealed recently that even the American public, whose lack of taste and judgement no one has lost money betting on, has finally realized they have suffered a loss of fundamental liverties these ten years past. I am puzzled by people whose only boast is their physical ancestry.  There are alot of anthropoid Anglo Saxons in Appalachia and elsewhere who are degraded as the black inhabitants of our country&rsquo;s inner cities. I ask you exercise some perspective.</p>

		<p>Any sort of de facto white organization is a good thing.  Radical opposition grows out of dissatisfaction with the results of moderate opposition, just as the Bolsheviks took over from the Mensheviks.  TPs who think they ask for so very little will see how much regard the Rulers have for their undeniably just requests, and some of them will draw the appropriate conclusion.  Racially clueless TPs will see how vilified they are, and some will ask why.  Racially aware people will join TPs and will influence them, without having to be explicit.  <br>
     Look how the Reds accuse the TPs of racism.  If any TP is unaware of race, the Left and the MSM are making sure that they become aware.  And as little as Blacks and Hispanics may know about the world around the corner, their leaders will make sure that they know the TP is a bunch of racist Whites out to steal their rights.  As non-White aggression increases and Whites are targeted, the TPs will become what our enemies say they already are.  </p>

Last week our on our local angry black man talk show, the host interviewed a black member of a South Carolina Tea Party by phone and a local white women.</p>
<p>Black callers demanded that Tea Parties stop their &#8216;hate&rsquo; and condemn anyone who expresses any form of &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The black man and the white woman both said they &#8216;condemned&rsquo; any &#8216;racism&rsquo; in the group but even this condemnation didn&rsquo;t stop the criticism.</p>
<p>Middle class whites are forming these groups not because of race but because they are the ones who are being over taxed. If blacks felt they were being over taxed, they too would join the movement. The truth is most blacks believe whites aren&rsquo;t being taxed enough and they see whites opposing high taxes as an attack on blacks and as racism.</p>
<p>The real problem for the Tea Party movement is will it be co-opted and corrupted by small-r republicans who see a pliable voting block up for grabs. </p>
<p>It gives me little hope that Tea Party groups rally around the likes of Sarah Palin and Sean Hannity. If they continue to support these same old hacks, the Tea Party movement is doomed.</p>

		<p>I understand Jared Taylor&rsquo;s point but white nationalism will marginalize any limited government movement.  I&rsquo;m sympathetic to the cause of keeping America European but the media machine has brainwashed people for 50 years that the worst thing you can be is a racist.  Though racism is a broad undefined term, it has become the number one weapon of the left to silence any discussion about the needs of European Americans.  </p>
<p>Buchanan is honest about his views on this subject which he expresses in his many books.  But when he writes columns or comments on MSNBC, he refrains from speaking his mind fully.  He is more honest than any other political commentator on television but if he makes white nationalism his number one cause, he will be silenced and marginalized.  The double standard that whites are not allowed to express pride for their heritage is unfortunate but historical events like slavery and the holocaust have been deeply ingrained into the American psyche to feel guilt as if modern whites committed these crimes themselves.  </p>
<p>I think the issues Ron Paul concentrates on are more realistic to accomplish.  If we can get rid of corruption that, I believe, has its foundation in the central banking system, then maybe we can address white identity issues.  Until then, white nationalism will only be used to smear our movement and drive away like-minded whites because they don&rsquo;t want to be called a racist.  The mild mannered tea parties get mad about socialist policies and the media has been hysterical to label them all as racist Nazis even though they have no evidence.  </p>

		<p>If the Tea Partiers are a virtually all white group that is patriotic and has reasons to by sympathetic with our views, why don&rsquo;t we do more to reach out to them? If all we do is sit on the side-lines while this movement passes us by, of course they are not going to be explicitly pro-white. It is up to us to bring in our message to what started as non-racial protests against inordinate federal spending.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some Tea Partiers have tried to make their movement appear anti-racist in a reactionary move to liberal accusations, but I also believe that the vast majority of Tea Partiers could accept our message if we only had the power and the will to deliver that message to them. Even if white advocacy does not sweep through the Tea Party movement, we still stand to make significant gains by trying harder than we are now, which isn&rsquo;t nearly enough.</p>

		<p>Do you really think that a woman like Sarah Palin who married a part Eskimo and has mixed race children is racially conscious?  Let&rsquo;s not forget her questionable ancestry on her mother&rsquo;s side of the family.</p>

		<p>I would like to thank Mr. Taylor for this article and his comments on the tea party movement. I completely agree that the tea parties are not only non-racialist but anti-racialist. From everything I have heard tea party leadership wants desperately to show just how anti-racist they are. I have no use for people like Sarah Palin or Ann Coulter myself. </p>
<p>There is nothing in the tea party program that appeals to me as a White racialist. I am sick to death of hearing that we just need to &#8220;elect conservative Republicans&#8221; Liberals and Conservatives today both have more in common than not and both oppose race realism. Conservatives live in a fantasy world and imagine that everything in America would be just fine if we went back to the 1980s or perhaps the 50s. Our problems are much deeper and they will not be easily solved. Their source is in a failed worldview, until we re-exam our core beliefs as a people there will be no hope for turning things around.</p>

		<p>Best insight yet from Jared Taylor is that a college is where you go to learn how to think and speak correctly about race, and after graduation go out and make enough money to move as far away from the blacks as possible.</p>
<p>That kind of conscience expansion is why I read Amren.  Nothing that real and vital comes out of SPLC, ADL, and MSNBC.  </p>

		<p>As I understand it the Tea Party is for lower taxes. I can&rsquo;t<br>
believe that all blacks etc. are for higher taxes. After all<br>
they aren&rsquo;t all on welfare.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t buy that the situation is that bleak. There have been many movements to reassert the rights of Whites in America: for example, voter initiatives against affirmative action; three strikes legislation; welfare reform; and now the Arizona immigration bill. The Tea Party movement is part of this generalized consciousness. </p>
<p>Granted, these movements address mainly symptoms, and are in the main crude attempts to deal with NAM dominated pathologies (such as street crime). And let us not forget that there is a sector among minorities who are against the welfare state and street crime and do provide some extra support for these movements, and thus can not be entirely taken out of the equation. </p>
<p>Look at it this way: if one could end the blatant symptoms of anti-White discrimination (such as affirmative action), or secure the borders of the country, or minimize the power of the government to redistribute wealth, then some maneuvering room would be gained for further political action. Moreover, such measures put the multicult on the defensive, forcing them to respond to the issues instead of creating them. </p>
<p>The real problem has been a lack of leadership from conservative politicians. Rather than capitalizing on popular sentiment to end affirmative action or enforce immigration laws, the mainstream of conservatism ducks the issues. <i>Why</i>  this is the case is central to the problem. </p>
<p>What is needed is a movement among conservative elites which would bring all these issues together. The raw materials are there, it will just take some leadership to turn them into a serious political force.</p>

<p>I DISAGREE!   Everyone is entitled to his opinion, of course, and that&rsquo;s a virtue of Amren;  but I don&rsquo;t see how gloomy posts of this nature serve any porpose here. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re so pessimistic about the future, why do you even bother to post anything at all?  Why even bother to read Amren?  Do you just read it in order to gloat?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Tea parties, just like opera companies, fret over their whiteness and claim to want to cure it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly. When the Metropolitan Opera was in its&rsquo; heyday, when Jews and blacks were not allowed to &#8216;darken&rsquo; the inner sanctum, Opera was a DECIDEDLY White event.</p>
<p>It was only as the ethnic solidarity of Jews (as Dr. Kevin MacDonald has shown) began to infiltrate NYC upper crust society, that the THOUGHT of allowing blacks in &#8216;whiteface&rsquo; (aping Europeans as historically valid characters in European operas) began.</p>
<p>It was Marian Anderson who, only in 1947, was allowed into the Met. And that, as a &#8216;token gesture.&rsquo; It was not until Leontyne Price in the 1960&rsquo;s that Black Divas began to make their appearances, and, as a music lover, not for the betterment of Art, Vocal studies, or historicity in Opera!</p>
<p>No, Whites are slowly, grudgingly making their exit from the enforced somnolence of a prior, dictated thought era. The Arts have for too long been entrusted to the bizarre, perverse, and cultural skanky - as though oddity=artistic genius. Thank God, that too, will change for the future. I can hardly wait!</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Show us the proof of what Whitey has done to your family. Don&rsquo;t just come on here and say things that we have no way of knowing if it is true or just made up&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>People who spout off about White racism and White oppression need to be confronted every single time and made to back up their marxist rhetoric with hard proof.</p>
<p>Anytime anyone accuses the Tea Party of racism, ask him to give you three specific examples of said racism.</p>
<p>Then ask why it&rsquo;s OK for non-White groups such as LaRaza to have as its motto:  &#8220;Everything for the (brown) race, for everyone else, nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this at my workplace  &mdash;  the government schools which are filled with uneducated, mindless idiots spouting marxist slogans about &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; like pre-programmed automatons, K-12 academia being one of THE ground zeros for communist indoctrination.  &#8216;Hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; the brainwashed can never seem to define when confronted  &mdash;  but that doesn&rsquo;t matter to them, only the hopeful idea of &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>All this while Whites are being openly discriminated against and completely displaced in the Southwest via non-White integration, preferences and confiscatory taxes.  None of that seems to matters either.</p>
<p>The old communists in Russia couldn&rsquo;t have done a better job; the Old Soviet Bosses would be proud.</p>
<p>Some on here have said it takes 10 years of reality  &mdash;  of being locked out of colleges and scholarships, passed over for jobs and promotions, after years of watching the media mock and debase Whites, the government forcing refugees from Africa into your city, declaring it &#8216;too White&rsquo;, with the newly arrived refugees receiving benefits and preferences over you and your children, lowered job status for Whites combined with high confiscatory taxes  &mdash;  for the insidious effects of marxist brainwashing to wear off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read some interesting theories lately as to marxist brainwashing actually changing the structure of the brain after being assaulted by years of indoctrination via the government, media and academia.  After years of seeing the results of White brainwashing in the government schools, of Whites unnaturally defending and supporting (usually virulently) non-Whites over themselves and their own children as I have, while debasing their own people (also virulently), I believe this must be true. </p>

		<p>I think Brother Pat has it right.  In my view, White racial consciousness is rising, but it is doing it (as I would expect) in small steps.  The first sign of this is that fewer Whites seem to have the need to say that they&rsquo;re not &#8220;racist,&#8221; at every opportunity.</p>

		<p>Some of you seem to have missed a broader point regarding this so-called Tea Party spiel. Pointing to the &#8220;values&#8221; and &#8220;lower-tax/less government&#8221; nature of the movement is meaningless! That is the exact same exhausted party-line the GOP has been selling to self-professed conservatives for decades! What is new or different here? Yet, notice that the Tea Party movement has already become a de facto wing of that same GOP who is always full of grand &#8220;conservative&#8221; &#8220;values and ideas&#8221; when not in power&hellip;and then shift right back into the same big government, white-hating, war-mongering globalists as soon as they con enough idiots to vote them back into power!</p>
<p>Wake up folks - Jared is right on the money! The Tea Party movement is a pleasant distraction for Fox News Channel types and scared old ladies&hellip;but not much else!</p>
<p>White Nationalists stand to gain little if anything from this &#8220;movement.&#8221; Of that I am convinced.<br>

		<p>This article needed to be written.  Far too many people who should know better have fallen for this Tea Party nonsense.  There has been so much projection and wishful thinking from our side on this phenomenon.  ALL this is about is Fox News watchers who are being sore losers.  </p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t anyone else remember the 1994 &#8220;Republican revolution&#8221; that gave the GOP control of Congress on the votes of &#8220;angry white males?&#8221;  It turned out that it did absolutely nothing for our cause.  Immigration increased and the mainstream conservative movement became less hospitable to white after that.  The Tea Party is almost the exact same thing as what happened in 1994, it&rsquo;s probably a lot of the same people too.  </p>
<p>We are not going to get anywhere until we have a movement that is explicitly pro-white.  </p>

		<p>I see a lot of negative comments on here about whites not awakening and not being able to be awakened.  Oh well, let&rsquo;s just all tie our TV&rsquo;s to our legs and jump off a bridge.</p>
<p>Actually, I agree with Pat Buchanan.  Sorry, the rest of you can&rsquo;t see it and just want to knock any movement or group that isn&rsquo;t 100% pure, but that&rsquo;s just the way human psychology works.  The awakening will be in small increments.</p>

		<p>Jared Taylor is absolutely right like usual. How fitting he used the word awakening, as in reference to the national cultural fits, the &#8220;great awakening(s)&#8221;, that occur periodically about every 80 years in American history. </p>
<p>The next &#8220;great awakening&#8221; is turning with the start of the 2040s. That will be the racial/cultural consciousness revolution we&rsquo;re hoping for. That&rsquo;s our grand opportunity.</p>
