			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Edward Rosen, New York Daily News, April 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Queens assemblywoman wants small businesses in Flushing to make their store signs, often written in Chinese or Korean characters, more English-friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I represent many constituents &hellip; who are not comfortable with not being able to fully understand signage outside of stores and inside stores,&#8221; said Grace Meng (D-Flushing), who is putting together an advisory board of local business owners to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Meng said that small businesses that use awnings often bearing signage written in foreign languages scare away potential customers, thereby hurting sales.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Confusing store signs could also complicate rescue efforts by fire and police squads responding to fires and crimes. Citing the deadly Monday morning Chinatown blaze that killed one and left hundreds homeless, Meng said that businesses were putting themselves and their neighbors at risk by not spelling out their business names and addresses clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re afraid of situations like that happening in Flushing,&#8221; Meng said.</p>
<p>Local officials agreed with Meng&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people coming in want to know what&rsquo;s in the store,&#8221; said Marilyn Bitterman, district manager of Community Board 7.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grace is not working this out of thin air. There are a lot of people who think that businesses should have two languages [on the store sign],&#8221; said Jim Gerson, chairman of the Flushing Business Improvement District.</p>
<p>Even businesses were in agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This store is not for Chinese or Korean people. This is for everyone,&#8221; said Sean Kim, 35, manager of Electronic Land on Northern Blvd., adding that his sign was written in both English and Korean.</p>

		<p>This is coming from a woman who calls herself &#8216;Grace&rsquo; Meng.</p>
<p>The first thing most Asians do in the West is take a Western name. This is calculated behaviour to put Westerners at ease. We whites wouldn&rsquo;t dream of such duplicitousness if we were living abroad, but it comes natural to them.  </p>
<p>They know we are more comfortable calling them &#8216;Kevin&rsquo; or &#8216;Vincent&rsquo;.  The Chinese wants to go about his industrious take-over without raising our alarms.  He will bow and act inoffensive to whites while doing all he can to take what he wants.</p>
<p>Now that whites are beginning to react to the influx of Asians, the Asian leadership are doubling their efforts to blend in and act sincere about integrating. They will play the game of hiding the signs and changing the facades, but undauntedly continue their nationalistic quest.</p>

		<p>And will she also say that stores who have signs and such in only Spanish likewise put up multi-language signs?  Or will she cave to the hispanic lobby and leave them alone?<br/>
More likely she will mandate oriental stores add Spanish to the signs.  Fact is, there are entire neighborhoods wherein signs are only Spanish, or Korean, or Chinese, or even Arabic.  It&rsquo;s a sign of the takeover of this country by ethnic groups who have no real ties to our laws, our culture, our language, our history, our values, or our faith.  How&rsquo;s that been working out so far?</p>

		<p>Since when is it the prerogative of government to ensure that businesses don&rsquo;t scare away their potential customers?</p>
<p>I simply don&rsquo;t shop at businesses which don&rsquo;t have English signs. If most of the people in an area speak English then market forces will ensure that these businesses go under and new, English-speaking stores replace them.</p>

		<p>I spend a lot of time in Flushing and don&rsquo;t find it a problem that some stores have only Chinese signs. If they do, and the potential customer doesn&rsquo;t read or speak Chinese, it simply means that the law of supply and demand is giving that particular place enough profit to not worry about or be interested in clients who don&rsquo;t understand the posted language. To tell you the truth, I find it quaint to see only Chinese signs since it makes me think that maybe I&rsquo;m on a temporary vacation away from New York City and all its hassles.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not make a &#8220;mountain out of a mole hill&#8221; with this kind of situation. There&rsquo;s plenty of &#8220;gut issue&#8221; news which is much more worthwhile to comment on.</p>

		<p>I grew up a couple of miles west of Flushing Queens (in a few other Queens neighborhoods) in the 40s-60s.</p>
<p>Flushing was ALL white. There wasn&rsquo;t ONE Oriental person who lived there. (OK - maybe there were a couple I missed!) Same with just about every other neighborhood.</p>
<p>On the very rare occasions when I go back to visit my old neighborhoods, I kid you not, I literally don&rsquo;t know what country (or planet) I&rsquo;m in (on). You can go for blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks in Flushing and NOT see ONE white person. And (unfortunately), I&rsquo;m not embellishing.</p>
<p>You can thank Ted &#8216;Swimmer&rsquo; Kennedy for all that. His 1965 Immigration Bill, which &#8220;would not change the demographic makeup of this country,&#8221; did EXACTLY that - and EVERY politician who voted for it KNEW it would and WANTED that to happen.</p>
<p>And it did.</p>
<p>And America, as some of us knew and in which we grew up, doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore&hellip;</p>

<p>UGH I have a Western name too&hellip;.  &#8220;Robert&#8221;  and putting Westerners at ease is not necessarily a negative thing either is it?  If East Asians insisted they continue using their original first names, I am not sure if that is a very positive thing either.</p>

<p>Maybe this dude just wants to make profit out of Caucasian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese customers.  </p>

<p><br/>
That&rsquo;s precisely why they&rsquo;re changing the signs. They want to make the stores more accessible to everyone. You can&rsquo;t (and also don&rsquo;t want to) read Chinese or Korean signs, do you? Poster #1 also seems to take issue with their personal anglophied names, but do you actually want to say their names as it sounds in their native language? Probably not. It sounds to me like these Asian minorities are making a genuine effort to integrate. <br/>

		<p>I live in NYC and this has always been a problem.  Whole streets filled with signs I cannot read.  Naturally, these businesses become dependent on their own narrow, ethnically-based clientelle.  They are more susceptible to highs and lows.</p>
<p>Same thing for restaurants.  I lie food of all ethnic groups, and I eat at japanese restaurants all the time because they always have signs loudly in English.  But I have never been in a korean owned restaurant because the signage always makes me feel I am unwelcome.  Chinese restaurants are usually in English, but not always, especially in the heart of Flushing&rsquo;s Chinatown.</p>
<p>I do applaud Meng&rsquo;s move.  Whites and Asians out this way are sort of like allies out here.  There&rsquo;s not much &#8216;integration&rsquo; on the stret level, but both sides live without fear of the other and pleasantries are exchanged among white/asian neighbors.  </p>
<p>The asian kids born here live as whites and follow white cultural trends, which is kind of uncanny to see.  (I once took my kids to a local nature preserve for a class, and the lady who was registering the kids was Asian, but not only did she have no accent, she talked like a white trash trucker.  I was totally surprised.)</p>
<p>I have noticed that Asian politicians out here are more likely to do things that benefit both asians and whites.  That is more than I can say about black or latino politicians who only follow race-based policies.</p>
<p>100 years from now, I foresee whites and asians being an integrated block on one side, and blacks and latinos being in opposition, though not united together.  (They hate each other out here and do not mix, except that blacks and dominicans will mix on the gang-banger level!)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not an American so it&rsquo;s not appropriate for me to tell you what to think of Asians. But I think if I were an American I&rsquo;d probably see East Asians as allies. They have their own homogeneous communities, which should be used as an example of what Whites should have as well. They also pay a lot of tax, they help you carry the White man&rsquo;s burden. They&rsquo;re a perfect example that the low achievement of blacks and Latinos is due to low IQ and not some kind of imaginary racism. Maybe in a few centuries Whites and East Asians will secede from the US and form their own country. And then they can peacefully secede from each other as well, just like Czechs and Slovaks have. </p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t? Then you are too young to remember what these places were like or you don&rsquo;t get the implication. This is COLONIZATION!</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s not make a &ldquo;mountain out of a mole hill&rdquo; with this kind of situation. There&rsquo;s plenty of &ldquo;gut issue&rdquo; news which is much more worthwhile to comment on.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an often repeated rationalization. The identity of the nation is THE gut issue. You&rsquo;ll know when law breaks down and these groups start claiming this territory outright, with no one to challenge them. Let&rsquo;s see how welcome you are there then.<br/>
Why do you ostriches work so hard to make molehills out of mountains?</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth, I find it quaint to see only Chinese signs since it makes me think that maybe I&rsquo;m on a temporary vacation away from New York City and all its hassles.&#8221;</p>
<p>No offense but you are really lost in space. Assuming you&rsquo;re white, do you not have any connection to your heritage, that you can treat this all so lightly? </p>
<p>&#8220;100 years from now, I foresee whites and asians being an integrated block on one side, and blacks and latinos being in opposition, though not united together.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t agree with just extrapolating out present condition, especially 100 years. I think it&rsquo;s better to focus on something within one&rsquo;s lifetime. Just common sense tells me that this can&rsquo;t go on for too much longer without something jumping off. Then who knows? Way too many factors in play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flushing was ALL white. There wasn&rsquo;t ONE Oriental person who lived there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s at least one person out there who remembers what the outer boroughs were really like. I worked in Flushing a long time ago and this is absolutely true. I&rsquo;m from East New York (when parts were still white) and Richmond Hill (where Sikhs wear their daggers now). In Richmond Hill there is a sort of bizzarre revision of history going on. The Indo-Caribbeans have their annual festival down Liberty Ave. and I once read coverage of it in some pennysaver. They made it sound like they were there for generations. They are erasing us outright and people like Paul Jones don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem with it. Insane.</p>
<p>Actually, all you have to do is look at old pictures and movies set in these places. I just recently watched &#8220;The Wrong Man&#8221; on TV and in it Henry Fonda lived in Jackson Heights. Go walk down Roosevelt Ave. now. The contrast was immediately jarring to me.</p>
<p>Yet somehow I&rsquo;m still optimistic. Don&rsquo;t ask me why.</p>

		<p>Mike from Not-Queens,</p>
<p>Maybe I would be more upset if I had grown up in an area and seen it change so much as Mike apparently did. In my case, I came to New York three years ago needing to find a fairly safe place to live and decided I could afford an area among mostly Orientals near Flushing since otherwise I&rsquo;d be stuck in a mostly black or Hispanic ghetto. Maybe for that reason I appreciate the work ethic of the Orientals, along with the fact that they value education for their children. For that reason it&rsquo;s more of a curiosity for me to see a sign in Chinese - in fact, if I were retired, I might consider taking up serious study of Mandarin. I see Chinese, Korean and Japanese as &#8220;honorary whites&#8221; so to speak, and have no trouble living among them.</p>

		<p>People are scared off by signs in East Asian languages?  I for one would have the opposite reaction, to wit, I&rsquo;m in a relatively crime-free neighborhood.</p>
<p>While it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good business decision for an Asian shopkeeper to identify a retail business with Korean of Mandarin characters, that&rsquo;s his business.  On the other hand, it be a tactic to discourage black and Hispanic clientele, which could make a lot of sense for businesses surviving in close promimity to those groups.</p>

		<p>The fact that people on here constantly promote an Asian-white alliance is truly frightening to me.  I haven&rsquo;t seen any evidence that Asians care about anybody other than Asians. We need to be focused on our own people and our future.  Mixing with Asians will do us no good at all and it most certainly isn&rsquo;t necessary.  Although SOME of them (strictly Northeast Asians) are civilized, they are still very different from us.  If you are an Asia-phile please move to Asia to live.  I highly doubt they will accept you though.  You are best off worrying about your own in today&rsquo;s world. </p>

		<p>I think Grace Meng is making a sensible, conciliatory gesture in the right direction. I don&rsquo;t think she should be accused of being sneaky. I agree too that their use of &#8220;Western&#8221; names is meant for our convenience. </p>
<p>But I have seen entire shopping centers in California (eg. around San Jose) which are completely Oriental, and there&rsquo;s no attempt to attract American customers. In Vancouver the same. And elsewhere. That is a bit disturbing. It makes you wonder what country you&rsquo;re in.  On the other hand, it must be said that they are seeking the business of &#8220;their own narrow, ethnic clientele&#8221;, and frankly, they are selling nothing that is likely to have any interest for (most) American customers.  Clothing, groceries, restaurants&hellip; they are all aimed at their own, not Americans. This applies to Indian and Arab markets too.  It&rsquo;s not surprising. I have seen stores specializing in British foods, or Russian, or French, German, Scandinavian, or Italian specialties. No one complains about that.  It&rsquo;s what you would expect to find in such a store. </p>
<p>An entirely different issue, however, is that of &#8220;colonization&#8221;, as Mike above points out. A few quaint speciality shops are one thing, but to take over the entire neighborhood is quite another and is bound to get people upset. There&rsquo;s a point where enough is enough.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s not the fault of these people, who are really just humble pawns trying to make a living. They&rsquo;re being used for those with larger aims.  The REAL fault is on the shoulders of the &#8220;elites&#8221; and  politicians   &mdash;    OUR politicians!   &mdash;   who have created this situation, quite deliberately, and who allow it to exist. It is no accident! This is the  wonderful &#8220;Diversity&#8221; that they are determined to impose on all the rest of us   &mdash;   whether we like it or not. And if we don&rsquo;t, well that&rsquo;s just too bad.  Diversity, ultimately,  is just the first step to replacement. </p>

		<p>I tend to agree with John, above   &mdash;   regardless of what you may think about ethnic enclaves like this (remember many US and other cities abroad have long had their Chinatowns or Little Italys) (sp?) it is NO business of the government to tell them what language/s they must post in.  If &#8220;Song&rsquo;s Spice Rack&#8221; wants to market to the Korean trade, that is strictly his business (pun intended).  Conversely   &mdash;   and here is the problem   &mdash;   if &#8220;MacMillan&rsquo;s Meat Market&#8221; seeks to market only to the English-speaking customer, he should not be required to post signs up in Spanish or Yiddish or Arabic.  Important   &mdash;   this is a far different thing from saying either of these should be permitted to actually turn customers away.</p>
<p>Regarding the other comment above about Asians taking Western first names:  1st, like it or not, America indeed has a long history of welcoming (legal) immigrants.  And immigrants, from wherever, have a long history of assuming American names.  I hate these &#8220;heads I win, tails you lose&#8221; arguments   &mdash;   I suppose keeping an Asian name would be evidence of refusal to assimilate and equally reprehensible?  2nd, if I were to emigrate to a foreign land where English was not spoken, yes, absolutely, I would assume a name that was more native-sounding.  And so should you.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;But I have never been in a korean owned restaurant because the signage always makes me feel I am unwelcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me apologize on their behalf.  Not having their signs in English is not only unfriendly to the locals, but also a very &#8220;less smart&#8221; move in the business perspective.  If I were in charge of the business, I would put the entire sign in English simply for the reason that it would result in higher profits, let alone the ethics.  It is a common sense!!  </p>
<p>If they wanted to be local ethnic Koreans friendly, they should have simply put a little Korean flag right at the door along with the American flag(or Canadian flag), and have the entire store sign in English.  And another little one at the counter.  That would not have been any less effective.  A little picture or a flag truly is wroth more than a billion words.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&rsquo;t seen any evidence that Asians care about anybody other than Asians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well hi there my Courtney&hellip;. I do not know what else I have to do to let you know I fully respect and care about the people who allowed my family to immigrate to Canada&hellip;. and appreciate for things I have seen and learned since I came to Canada.  </p>
<p>And I will gladly do it one more time.  </p>
<p>and I just spent a couple of minutes trying to come up with something I have not told you in the past&hellip;.  </p>
<p>Here is one, let me tell you about one of my favourite, most meaningful memories while I was a teenager.  </p>
<p>The youth group of my church, composed of girls and boys in late-teens, went to the local seniors&rsquo; houses on a Friday night once a month and did a variety of chores the local seniors asked us to do.  It was called &#8220;The Scott Mission&#8221; arranged by another non-profit organization in Toronto.  How it works is, they receive requests from seniors in Toronto on the phone.  And then, they give the list of requests made by seniors to the young people who agreed to give a hand and spend one evening per month visiting the seniors.  And the pastor at my church had decided to get the entire youth group involved with the Scott Mission.  Some of the seniors asked us to come and clean, some asked us to come and fix furniture, some asked us to come and help them with their electronics equipments or computers, and some of them asked us to simply come in for a friendly visit&hellip; have tea&hellip; play cards with them&hellip;  I remember that there were one or two black seniors, and the majority of them were Caucasian.  I remember paying a visit to a German lady&hellip; she asked a few of us to come over and do some gardening.  While I was doing the gardening, I told her my favourite place on the planet is Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany.  It is not the first time I stated on AmRen that that is my favourite place on the planet.  </p>

<p>She was so pleasantly surprised that I knew quite a bit about Germany&hellip;  Brandenburg Gate&hellip; Koln Cathedral&hellip; Charlottenberg Palace&hellip;  She gave us a lot of cookies while we were staying at her house for the evening.  I remember&hellip; a few hours later, the pastor pulled over near her house and told us to say good night to the lady and get in the van so he would bring us back to the church&hellip; we said good night to the lady and started walking towards the van&hellip; and then I turned around, looked into her eyes for one second, and I walked back to her without saying a word, grabbed her head, and gave her a big kiss on her forehead, and then came to the van.  </p>
<p>Most seniors were absolutely courteous to us who came to visit&hellip; but some of the seniors were not necessarily angels&hellip;  I remember one senior simply slamming the door when I and another guy were done cutting the grass in her backyard&hellip; She did not even give us a glass of water.  I remember another lady who yelled at us as soon as we knocked on her door&hellip; and I remember one guy sharing his experience that he and another guy fulfilled the entire request in ten minutes and got kicked out of the house right away just like that&hellip;  but those incidents did not matter a bit to us.  We expected some of the seniors to be like that, because not all Korean seniors are angels either.  Also, in Korean culture, it is acceptable and very normal for adults to be sometimes rude to young people.  We knew, a few seniors cannot comprehend all that properly once they are past a certain age.  We were not being a part of the Scott Mission because we wanted to get something from them in return or at least expect their recognition and appreciation out loud.  We did it because it was very meaningful to do it.  We were happy and proud that we could light up somebody&rsquo;s evening once a month.  A few months later, a few of the seniors came over to our church and prepared a warm dinner for our youth group&hellip; which we all enjoyed a lot. </p>

<p>Some of the lessons I learned since I came to Canada truly changed my life&hellip;  And visiting the seniors as a responsibility at the Scott Mission will be one of my favourite memories while I was a teenager&hellip;.  it was such a wonderful part of my life so far.  </p>
<p>Some of the lessons I have learned, and things I saw and some people I have met and learned from, forever changed my life. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t post on AmRen to brag about how successful Korea has been in recent years.  I don&rsquo;t post on AmRen to insist or prove that Koreans are cool.  I remember, when I first introduced myself on AmRen and posted for the first time, I received a bunch of, &#8220;you want a white girlfriend don&rsquo;t you?&#8221; haha&hellip;  I say it for the 1000000th time.  Even if there are no compliments regarding South Korea on AmRen, I would still visit and post on AmRen just as often.  And I feel I will say it again and again in the future&hellip; I don&rsquo;t mind.  I guess I have no choice!! </p>

		<p>Here in Spain where an estimated 3/4-million Brits have settled in Spain, mainly retired, and a few have opened bars and shops.  At first most only had menus and signs in English, not Spanish and the the locals quite rightly objected.  It really is quite rude and as stated here in another comment a bad business move because many of the Spanish want to socialise with us expats. who are intelligernt (so not all of us).  We have Spanish friends here who cannot speak English at all and they are great friends. We visit and eat with them and they reciprocate with us.  But then many of us Brits come here and do not bother to learn Spanish except how to order a beer.  As a result local councils have made local laws that all business signsm, and menus must be in at least Spanish.  The sensible ones have menus in Spanish, English, German, Dutch and French as we have great holiday beaches all along the south of Spain.  Perhaps the USA problem is also that the Koreans etc do not speak English very well?<br/>
But I like to get on with people and I like them to get on with me but some of the Brits here think I am a racist because I speak my mind about the facts of life (I lived in South Africa for 23 years), but I often prove to them that they are really the racists with their flawed attitudes.  </p>
<p>It is not that difficult to do with ignorant people who have not travelled much. When they start to insult you and use ad hominen, I know I am winning as their arguments are failing then.  It is a good feeling.</p>
<p>God bless America and stay great: do not turn Socialist.  Lok what it has done to Britain.</p>

		<p>Speaking of korean people, can&rsquo;t really understand their affinity for christianity. As i&rsquo;ve stated before, I find it surprising that such an educated people can bring themselves to believe in fairytales&hellip; Especially as mentioned before, an emasculating fairy tale. Perhaps it is christianity has been hijacked by the liberal media to force this multiculturalism nonsense on us all. Wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me a bit. </p>
<p>Would asian people ally with white people? Honestly I doubt it. Just being educated and affluent doesn&rsquo;t guarantee an ally. Consider that most of the white, liberal, pc dimwits are also educated and affluent, yet they are clearly against anything espoused here in AMREN. Lets just be honest, asian people are mostly FOLLOWERS. They will just go along with the prevalent political attitudes, careful to never stir up too much controversy. If actual commonsense about racial matters was socially acceptable then asian americans would be on board, but if, as it is now, it is deemed unacceptable, then asians are by no means going to challenge the status quo. Asian Americans at best, make for very tenuous allies; being extremely susceptible as they are to external opinion and manipulation. I also want to add that it is mostly the younger generations of asians (which I am part of) who gladly go along with whatever society/media dictates we do. The older generation could be looked to for potential allies, but obviously they will not be around forever. What do I suggest? Admire asians/asian americans for their moral/intellectual similarity to whites, but don&rsquo;t expect much at all from them. Asians, collectively lack backbone. We hardly fight our own fights, why should whites expect that we would fight theirs? So yes, in a nutshell, asian americans will NOT rock the boat. </p>

<p> &#8220;They also pay a lot of tax, they help you carry the White man&rsquo;s burden&#8221;  Asian businesses pay almost no tax whatsoever.  I mean all taxes including sales tax.  Asians who own their own businesses or who work for Asian businesses pay no taxes.  Either they are paid in cash or they fill out 10 deductions of their WW2&4 forms.  Then they pay no tax at all on the first $25,000 and little on the rest.  If they never file tax returns with those bogus WW2s, they are never caught.</p>
<p>If they work for the government or for an American company they claim 10 dependents and never file tax returns and are never caught as long as they never file a tax return.</p>
<p>Their elders all get $700.00 per month social security supplemental althought they arrived in this country at age 60 and never contributed a dime to social security.</p>
<p>Granted they are not murdering, raping and robbing us as the blacks do, but they don&rsquo;t pay taxes.</p>
<p>Every time I read one of those MSM sniveling successful Asian immigrant stories I know exactly how the success was achieved:<br/>
tax evasion and cheating employees, customers, vendors, landlords and even the electrical, water and power companies.</p>

		<p>All businesses should have the address clearly written for the convenience of everyone.  Downtown Los Angeles is a nightmare.  All the big buildings are Plazas or super blocks of some kind with nary an address in sight for blocks.  Add the one way streets and it can be impossible to find a building.</p>
<p>The old slummy buildings in downtown Los Angeles at least have addresses.  But the newer buildings were built by architiects who thought it fashionable to not have an address.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that Asians are followers. You think Asians aren&rsquo;t going to challenge the status quo, but that&rsquo;s more a result of low population and (what I think is)a desire to integrate. Asians only make up 4% of the population; the people of Japanese, Korean and Chinese descent (also known as the &#8220;East Asian triumvirate&#8221;) are half of that or less. Their political involvement is steadily growing, but still limited. </p>
<p>Much of America&rsquo;s past is characterized by conflict with Asian nations (Vietnam War, Korean War, Pearl Harbor), so history is working against Asians a bit too.</p>
<p>There are lots of other groups to worry about (e.g., blacks, hispanics, muslims etc). The only reason that Asians are scrutinized at all is because they&rsquo;re the best of the non-Whites; which in turn has produced a mixed opinion here about these people.  </p>
