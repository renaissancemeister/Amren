<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Is white the new black?&#8221;</p>
<p>So asks Kelefa Sanneh in the subtitle of &#8220;Beyond the Pale,&#8221; his New Yorker review of several books on white America, wherein he concludes we may be witnessing &#8220;the slow birth of a people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanneh is onto something. For after a year of battering as &#8220;un-American,&#8221; &#8220;evil-doers&#8221; and racists, and praise from talk-show hosts and Sarah Palin as &#8220;the real Americans,&#8221; Tea Party America seems to be taking on a new and separate identity.</p>
<p>Ethnonationalism  &mdash;  the recognition of an embryonic people that they are different from their neighbors, and the concomitant drive to live apart  &mdash;  is, as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote 20 years ago, a more powerful force than any ideology, be it communism, fascism or democracy.</p>
<p>Ethnonationalism is the pre-eminent force of the age we have entered, the creator and destroyer of empires and nations. Even as Schlesinger was writing his &#8220;Disuniting of America,&#8221; Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union were disintegrating into 22 new nations, along the lines of ethnicity. In Dagestan, Ingushetia, Chechnya, Ossetia and Abkhazia, the process proceeds apace.</p>
<p>It has happened before  &mdash;  and here.</p>
<p>In the American colonies, the evil institution of slavery, followed by a century of segregation, created out of the children of captured Africans who had little in common other than color a new people, the African-Americans, who went out and voted 24-to-one for Barack Obama.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adversity and abuse increase the awareness of separate identity and accelerate the secession of peoples from each other.</p>
<p>Obama in the campaign of 2008 recognized that &#8220;out there&#8221; in Middle America existed another country, far from the one he grew up in, far from the privileged Ivy League community to which he belonged.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the jobs have been gone now for 25 years. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So it&rsquo;s not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren&rsquo;t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Palin and Tea Partiers now repeat Obama&rsquo;s disparaging line about their clinging to Bibles and guns  &mdash;  with defiant pride.</p>
<p>As others have done in our multicultural and multiethnic nation, this people is beginning to assert its identity, unapologetically.</p>
<p>Sioux gather at Little Bighorn to celebrate the massacre of Custer&rsquo;s command. Hawaiian natives demand a new ethnically based government  &mdash;  and receive Obama&rsquo;s blessing. Hispanics march under Mexican flags in Los Angeles to demand citizenship for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Now Southerners are proudly commemorating ancestors who fought and fell in the Lost Cause and demanding recognition of Confederate History Month. And state governors are acceding.</p>
<p>In 2004, when Howard Dean reached out to &#8220;guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks,&#8221; Shelby Steele wrote that this was &#8220;absolutely verboten. Racial identity is simply forbidden to whites in America&#8221; because of their history and white guilt.</p>
<p>This, Sanneh suggests, is changing. The imputation of racism to Tea Partiers has not intimidated or cowed them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Why are the Tea Partiers not intimidated the way Republicans often are? Why is the charge of racism not working?</p>
<p>First, they do not feel the guilt of country-club Republicans.</p>
<p>Second, they know it to be untrue. While Tea Partiers are anti-Obama, they are also anti-Pelosi, anti-Martha Coakley and anti-Charlie Christ. The coming conflict is not so much racial as it is cultural, political and tribal.</p>
<p>Black America seems united. White America is the house divided, for it is in the womb of white America that this new people is gestating and fighting to be born.</p>

		<p>I am a huge fan of Pat Buchanan. He is informed and articulte on just about every subject. When he ran for president I voted for him. I sure hope he is right. Its time whites showed some soladarity as history shows whites are easily the most accomplished race in any area. Our modern era and its many achievements in evey field was created by whites. Since I believe and know the many wonderful things created by whites I believe whites are superior to every other race. I do not shy away from the term &#8220;racist.&#8221; I welcome it. For it shows I understand the world I live in and who created it. </p>

		<p>Be still my beating heart.Seldom does my Scots-Irish blood start to percolate. The white tigers, Saxon defenders, Celtic dreamers, Polish lancers, Dutch Stradholders, Irish warrior poets,Italian mercenaries,Spanish conquistadors,Israeli Hagganah at last comming together to assert themselves among the nations. Brothers it doesn`t get any better than this. The raiders,traders,and adventurors from ancient Troy to modern Tuscalossa are at lasr standing up and telling those who work 24 hours a day to enslave them to kiss off. Soon somebody will start the mantra,&#8221; Come on those who want us all to be equal over and under the skin,let`s get the dance started.&#8221;<br>

		<p>My God how I wish this were true&hellip;but is it? If there is any racial angle at all to the Tea-Party movement, it seems by most accounts that the &#8220;Partiers&#8221; themselves are least aware of it! Indeed, it seems to me that Tea Party folks by and large fall all over themselves to insist that theirs is a cause of &#8220;liberty, consititutionalism,&#8221; and similar rhetoric - but nothing to do with race. </p>
<p>Granted, the implicit enthno-nationalistic nature of the movement is undeniable - but that seems lost on those closest to it!  </p>
<p>I do so hope Pat is correct&hellip;but I have my doubts. </p>

<p>While I would like to believe this is happening and would happen if white people were left alone, anti-white laws (IE, &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; laws) prohibit whites from free association.</p>
<p>Any white community that developed a consciousness would quickly be condemned, infiltrated, and dismantled.</p>
<p>One doesn&rsquo;t need to prove &#8216;racism&rsquo;. The mere presence of too many whites is all the proof our government needs to destroy white solidarity.</p>

		<p>With almost every white I meet, we have the discussion of &#8216;those people&rsquo; and how they feel betrayed by their government, their media, their churches even. Whites are prohibited from having any sort of white identity, yet blacks can have separate graduation ceremonies, college dorms, clubs, and entire neighborhoods exclusively to themselves. Yet whites dare pose the question of any form of exclusively white socialization or living arrangements, and the full weight of the PC crowd comes down on them. </p>
<p>  Every white I talk to knows the lie, and repeats the PC dogma simply to get along, keep a job and not be ridden out of town. The Tea Party may become the entry point for many whites who feel no other place respects them for what they are, and it does not yet carry the &#8216;racist&rsquo; stigma that the CNN MSNBC crowd try to force upon it. If the Tea Party is the place of their awakening to bigger and more racially aware discussion here and elsewhere I say that&rsquo;s great. We have spent the last 50 years feeling guilty for simply being white!  No more! Finally people are seeing that the failures of blacks in America is all but exclusively the fault of their culture and DNA. </p>
<p>Whites repeatedly see how it is a DISadvantage to be white, and even worse, male in the current society. A white male has effectively no recourse or ability to claim discrimination. At long last the gloves are coming off, and whites are feeling enough anger at being blamed for every black failure, all the while blacks are offered every advantage over them.  When the wages of silence and speaking out are the same, sooner or later whites will speak up for their white interests. I am thrilled to finally see it coming to light! </p>

<p>And if racial awareness has finally begun to dawn in America&rsquo;s white majority, multiculturalism can be seen as the primary factor that has induced it. No, it is not what it was intended to engender; quite the contrary, it was designed as a means of totally exterminating the white race both in this country and on the planet. However, a genocide no matter how cleverly honeyed and propagandized as being &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; cannot be anything other than abusive and cause adversity toward the group slated for destruction. </p>
<p>Thus, the ultimate Achilles heel that will utterly destroy multiculturalism, despite all its sanctimonious Marxist pretensions: it is dependent on the very group it seeks to destroy.</p>
<p>While I do not see the Tea Party or Sarah Palin as being truly a white racial awareness movement, I do admit that we could be seeing the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; harbinger of such within it. Or perhaps better put, we could be seeing the final death throes of the American political right to remain in the &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; game. </p>
<p>Either way, who cares, so long as white racial dispossession is reversed and our planned extermination is tossed into history&rsquo;s sewage system, right along with Marxist multiculturalism and its adherents.</p>

		<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I haven&rsquo;t seen any racial ideaology in the Tea Party movement. The people who subsribe to this movement are protesting big government, excessive government spending, socialism in general, etc. I don&rsquo;t know of any prominent Tea Party proponents who advocate pro-white principles, such as an end to affirmative action, reversing our open borders policy with the Third World, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that I disgaree with the Tea Partiers. My point is that I disagree with the author of this article, who views the Tea Party movement as something ethnonationalistic, to use his term, for white people.</p>
<p>However, I do hope that the author&rsquo;s forsight proves to be accurate, that an awakening of white racial consciousness is in its dawn.</p>

This article was far too important and significant to {snip}, Jared.</p>
<p>I read this article at its source this morning and was literally giddy. 5 years ago a &#8220;mainstream&#8221; journalist like Buchanan would NEVER dream of penning something like this. Now its becoming the norm. </p>
<p>Of course, we long-time AR readers have known this stuff forever, thanks to your tireless efforts, Jared. And as much as you&rsquo;ve been vilified over the years, I truly believe the day will come (in the not-so-distant future) when society recognizes you for the visionary you are and always were.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to a Tea Party and you couldn&rsquo;t prove it by me that these people didn&rsquo;t care whether they&rsquo;re labeled racist or not.  I recall at least one speaker who went out of his way to prove he&rsquo;s not racist and one woman who told me I didn&rsquo;t have to be there when I shouted some un-pc things out into the crowd.  I&rsquo;m puzzled why Pat Buchanan is trying to spotlight the Tea Parties when all the information coming out points to them being co-opted by the faux right.  Pat I have some respect for you so please don&rsquo;t fritter it away by portraying that race mixing ziobot &!!&% as one of us. Enough of Sarah Palin!</p>

Several years ago my wife and I took in a stray puppy. We asked our veterinarian if the old fashioned way of rubbing a dog&rsquo;s nose in their poop was the best method of house training. Her answer was quite eye opening - on many levels. She said &#8220;the only thing rubbing a dog&rsquo;s nose in it&rsquo;s own feces will accomplish will be to teach it to not rub it&rsquo;s nose in it&rsquo;s own feces.&#8221;<br>
For how long now have we had our noses rubbed in the &#8220;feces&#8221; of slavery and discrimination? I suspect that we are just now learning not to rub our own noses in it!!! It&rsquo;s about DAMN time!</p>

		<p>&#8220;White America is the house divided, for it is in the womb of white America that this new people is gestating and fighting to be born.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is the ongoing racial animus by blacks and Hispanics&hellip;but especially blacks&hellip;. towards whites and all things white; the growing threat to white middleclass values, culture and history; the shift of white wealth to black incompetents; and the impending doom created by out-of-control spending and reckless, greedy lending practices to non-whites, that is causing a unification in white power that was never there before. </p>
<p>Tea party people are aware that the country is on the verge of economic implosion, and they&rsquo;re looking to create a renewal.  They intuit that this community organizer is anti-white with his conduct in the Henry Gates affair, his association with Jeremiah Wright and his thousands of anti-white congreants, his appointment of a white hating &#8220;wise Latina,&#8221; and the many statements he has inadvertently made, which reveal a pro-black, anti-white, anti-American agenda.</p>
<p>Mr. Buchannan didn&rsquo;t touch on it, but it should be noted that the one factor that will assure the success of this white unification movement is further economic chaos and more arrogantly stupid decisions by this president and his coterie of oddballs.</p>
<p>And both are apt to get worse as we get further into 2010.</p>

		<p>Pat is just projecting some Agrarian-Sam Francisian-David Duke hope and calling it momentum.</p>
<p>Never forget that Eisenhower, who was a White like us, federalized the White Arkansas Guard and forced racial diversity privilege integration upon  White Arkansas at the point of federal guns. From an image search of &#8220;little rock 1957&#8221; you will not see any non whites holding loaded rifles while protecting the afrovoodoo diversity privileges from the evil White Citizens of Arkansas.  Whites brought the ruin of Whites.  Afro Diveristy Privileges were just the agency.  The power of the ruling White elites was the cause.</p>
<p>Whites in power will do whatever is necessary to other Whites in order to keep themselves power, and they won&rsquo;t let Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s fantasy of White Awareness come true if that kind of Unity is a threat.</p>
<p>Pat will probably soon be arrested for the hate crime of even putting the idea out there that Whites can come together in spite of charges of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Brazen (which means &#8220;armed&#8221;) afro diversity privilege thugs who rob, rape, and murder Whites are tolerated with more open minded inclusion that are Whites who come together and resist cowering in the face of the racism branding iron.</p>

		<p> Excellent column from a man who is never afraid to say what needs to be said, whether certain people like it or not. I think he&rsquo;s onto something. Hopefully this Tea Party Movement will continue to grow, and to gestate just what he said: a new ethnic group, so to speak: Caucasian Americans.</p>

		<p>I simply don&rsquo;t believe the Tea Party mvt is about race.  Yes, we&rsquo;re majority white, but we&rsquo;re also majority older, and more well educated than average.  We care about ISSUES rather than race; we want guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t spending stopped, we want the healthcare bill rescinded, and we want small business taxes alleviated.  If those are white issues, fine; but that&rsquo;s as a side issue rather than one of specific intent.  I&rsquo;m not against whites banding together, but I believe it&rsquo;s better to do it with issues other than race as the glue that holds us together.  </p>

		<p>Remember a few years ago when some Black &#8220;leader&#8221; offered up a hypothetical scenario in which Whites awaken one morning to find that there are no Blacks around. He tried to conjure up images of what a total disaster it would be. What would White people do? he asked.  I remember thinking that there would be 85% percent fewer rapes and murders, and other assorted acts of violence.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we could organize every White person in this once great nation to stay home for two days? What a message it would send and what a wake up call to all who think that we&rsquo;ve become superfluous. I&rsquo;m beginning to think that the only way to prevent a violent conflagration is the total partitioning of the US. As Bob Grant would say, &#8221; This used to be my country but now it&rsquo;s just where I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have a big problem with that statement. YES, IT IS RACIAL! Why is it that RACE and the ensuing problems it brings cannot be talked about honestly? Even in this article it has to be stated that it really &#8220;isn&rsquo;t about race&#8221; etc. REALLY? Of course it is! Our racial enemies knows it is all about race and it is their race they only care about! So when are Whites going to wake up to the fact that it their own race that is being attacked over and again?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s surprising how many whites are not even aware of organizations like AmRen or the CofCC. For sure, there is a conspiracy by main stream media and government to say as little as possible about white organizations. There needs to be a focus by white missionaries to educate as many whites as possible that there are ways to participate in the movement. This isn&rsquo;t sufficient to guarantee a successful white movement but it is necessary. </p>

<p>Why he is still allowed to speak as a free Man in Amerika is a puzzle. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree 100 percent with all of his positions but know of no one alive that has fought more against one sided foreign trade that has gutted the working man or spoken more often or more passionately about the decline of his people in the country they founded via massive and unending immigration, sacrificed on the Altar of Diversity and Multiculturalism.<br>
 He also is against us invading the world and having 100 foreign bases and does not look kindly on having Isreal,  lead our leaders around by the nose.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sioux gather at Little Bighorn to celebrate the massacre of Custer&rsquo;s command. Hawaiian natives demand a new ethnically based government &mdash; and receive Obama&rsquo;s blessing. Hispanics march under Mexican flags in Los Angeles to demand citizenship for illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Which, if you stop to think of it for just a moment, shows how far we have lost our grip on this country which we thought we had conquered. The ownership of the continent is being contested.  We now have only a tenuous, and slipping, hold on what we thought was ours.  It is still &#8220;ours&#8221;, legally and technically, &#8216;though not always so in practice&hellip;. but for how much longer?  </p>
<p>Such demonstrations would never have been thought of, nor tolerated, prior to the Civil Rights mania of the 1960s, which has gripped us ever since (and grown ever more rabid and virulent).  As it turns out, &#8220;civil rights&#8221;  (which we were sold as a great improvement at the time)  really meant  &#8220;anti-whites&#8221;.  Many are now waking up to that shocking revelation.

		<p>Would that it were so, but I fear Pat is engaging in wishful thinking.  The Tea Party, like the GOP and mainstream conservatives, bristles at the charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; not because they resent the demonization of legitimate race realism and pro-white sentiment, but because they genuinely lack white racial consciousness and solidarity, and are frustrated that this &#8220;virtue&#8221; is not recognized.  Indeed, they eagerly trots out the handful of blacks they have to prove themselves non-&#8220;racist&#8221;.  The Henry Louis Gates incident merely resulted in the disappointment of white idealists discovering their puffed up post-racial Messiah had a big streak of the ordinary race-baiting police-hating black pol.  Note &#8220;post-racial&#8221; - the only legitimate grounds on the mainstream Right for rejecting anti-white deeds and words remains racial neutrality and non-racial universalism, NOT a muscular defense of our own honor, identity, self-determination, and interests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are the Tea Partiers not intimidated the way Republicans often are? Why is the charge of racism not working?&#8221;</p>
<p>What rubbish!  Everywhere you look all you see is Tea Partiers falling over themselves to prove to the media they are NOT &#8220;racist&#8221;.  How?  By leaving no stone unturned in finding non-Whites (but especially blacks like Alan Keyes) to join their movement.</p>
<p>Recently a Tea Party was held in Manhattan.  A friend of mine attended.  He told me the overwhelming majority of people there were White.  Who was everyone turning to for &#8220;leadership&#8221;?  A Chinese man!  Pathetic.</p>
<p>King Solomon was right: &#8220;There is nothing new under the sun.&#8221;  I stand by my earlier contention: White Americans by and large are cowards.  If the Tea Party movement really wanted to have any chance of surviving and growing it would evolve into a racialist movement, but it won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>Ok, folks, lissen up.  I just got a long article from a good friend, and it states flatly that debt will overwhelm Britain over the summer and cause its economy to collapse, and it will follow here in the U.S. sometime during the winter of 2010-11.  So fellow whites, PREPARE!!!  Stock up on food (http://efoodsdirect.com is a good source), water, guns, ammo, and get as much silver in your hands as you can, in any form as long as it&rsquo;s at least .925, because the dollar is going to collapse and the silver will be negotiable by weight as money.  We are in for a long period of suffering; if you have land and can plant food, you are blessed.  This is not a joke; I wish it was.  My friend, BTW, has been &#8216;right on&rsquo; about a number of items this year, and I trust him.  I hope you guys listen.  If you want our race to survive, get ready fast.  We&rsquo;ve got about 6 months.</p>

		<p>Definitely not. As a whole, I would say that whites are no more racially conscious right now than they were pre-Obama or pre-financial disaster. Perhaps in small, scattered bundles there has been an increase in racial consciousness, but certainly not at the &#8216;mass level.&rsquo; And, even where there has been an increase, it is usually nothing really meaningful, just ad hoc frustration in the face of worsening external conditions. In other words, even those who are beginning to think in racial terms care very little for fundamental principles, they are mostly just concerned with reducing their taxes, getting government off their backs, etc. </p>
<p>It would be a big, big mistake to misinterpret this as something which could faciliate a broad consensus on fundamental questions of race. It is nothing of the sort. As soon as these people feel that they have accomplished their goal   &mdash;   which is merely to externally reform the system   &mdash;   I would be willing to bet that 95% of them would just revert back to their older consciousness.</p>
<p>These people are not concerned with &#8216;whites&rsquo; as an independent racial entity: they are simply concerned with &#8216;whites&rsquo; as a targeted group which must bear a disproportionate share of the material and cultural hardship of our time. If you were to remove this status which leads to such negative consequences, the situation would be totally different. Again, it would be wrong to construe this as being a more generalized &#8216;concern&rsquo; with the real issues facing whites as a racial group&hellip;</p>

		<p>I think what scares the elites and the talking heads the most is to see a large numbers of white Americans gathered together anytime or any place.  I remember once when I was present in downtown Chicago on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  The Loop as we call it was unusually crowded with whites, young, old, men, women, etc., all coming downtown to witness the parade and join in the fun.  I was in the lobby of the Richard J. Daley Center and observed the many Black City workers(that&rsquo;s all they hire now)with a kind of shocked look on their faces as they gazed out the windows at the huge all white crowds.  One of the Black City employees said out loud, &#8220;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;re all from the suburbs.&#8221;  I thught then and still do that it was the white flight out of Chicago&rsquo;s neighborhoods after the riots in the late 1960&rsquo;s that has contributed to our present situation.  There was a cohesiveness in the neighborhoods that you don&rsquo;t have any more.  I think too they were more conservative politically then the whites that have moved into the city now.  They tend to be from other cities and states, more brain washed and very PC.  You see it in the make-up of the Tea Partiers too.  Mostly older people.  Far too few younger ones.  If young whties don&rsquo;t developthis racial pride in their white culture and heritage, then I don&rsquo;t it will work.  Pat Buchanan is probably the only one who dares to speak about race, don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for Hannity, Palin, or Bill O&rsquo;Reilly to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is the ongoing racial animus by blacks and Hispanics&hellip;but especially blacks&hellip;. towards whites and all things white; the growing threat to white middle class values, culture and history; the shift of white wealth to black incompetents; and the impending doom created by out-of-control spending and reckless, greedy lending practices to non-whites, that is causing a unification in white power that was never there before.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would like to point out what should be the glaringly obvious fact that the two primary organized, and well-funded, anti-White organizations in America (and their tentacles also reach out across the globe and into every majority White European nation)are #1:  The Anti-Defamation League of B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith, and #2:  The $outhern Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>These two anti-white, subversive organizations are not funded or heavily staffed with the Blacks or Mestizos that Mr. Ranger inaccurately assigns blame to, for being opposed to &#8216;all things white&rsquo;.   This is not to say that the La Raza and the NAACP organizations that do represent the organized Mestizo and Black anti-white storm troopers are not also declared enemies of the white majority, but I would say that they both occupy a lower level on the anti-white ladder of racist organizations.    </p>
<p>I would even go so far as to observe that these two organizations appear to take their marching orders from the ADL and the $PLC. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the importance of prioritizing the opposition, fellow AR readers.   Think of this battle in a similar fashion as to how an advanced Navy combat weapon system will scan the horizon, identify the incoming threats, assign a priority to each, and then engage their countermeasures accordingly.</p>

Our racial enemies knows it is all about race and it is their race they only care about! So when are Whites going to wake up to the fact that it their own race that is being attacked over and again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Once I saw a cartoon in the newspaper, obviously drawn by a feminist.  A bunch of women are sitting in front of a TV set.  The voice coming out of the TV says, &#8220;Once again, there was no crime today!&#8221;  One woman says to another, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s have some more cheesecake!&#8221;  The caption underneath said, &#8220;What the world would be like if there were no men.&#8221;  In other words, without men, there&rsquo;d be no crime and women could eat whatever they wanted to because they wouldn&rsquo;t have to watch their figures to attract men.  </p>
<p>Well, I can envision a similar cartoon, &#8220;What the world would be like if there were no blacks or Hispanics.&#8221;  A group of whites would be watching TV and the announcement, again, would be &#8220;There was no crime today.&#8221;  The whites would turn to each other and say, &#8220;What a beautiful, moonlit night it is.

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree that Pat is engaging in wishful thinking. He makes it clear in the article that the movement is not yet fully racial in nature. But I agree with the premise that it is something straining to be born. Somebody in another comment said that many whites he talks to understands what&rsquo;s going on but can&rsquo;t say it outright. This has been my experience as well. Even libs are getting very uncomfortable, sometimes without knowing why. Too much pressure is building up and with a financial meltdown at least possible if not likely people will be expressing directly what they couldn&rsquo;t before, to keep their jobs for example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bothered by all the pessimism among real WN&rsquo;s (weeding out the provocateurs, of course). It isn&rsquo;t JUST a numbers game and things in real life don&rsquo;t just extrapolate out inevitably. Pat&rsquo;s article suggests that things can change with startling suddenness, at least to those that haven&rsquo;t been paying attention.<br>
There is a gradualism that has been occuring that is accelerating. Anybody who remembers the early &rsquo;90s or earlier, when whole neighborhoods were being taken over by non-whites and there was NO way to express opposition, knows what desperation and pessimism are like. It&rsquo;s far better today, with things coming out into the open that couldn&rsquo;t be conceived of even only two years ago. Ours wasn&rsquo;t the only frog being boiled.</p>
<p>Just keep spreading the world. No one can predict the outcome but at least I can make one prediction that I&rsquo;m reasonably sure of. The idea that we were all going to just roll over and take it is complete and utter nonsense.</p>

<p>Buchanan&rsquo;s book may be helpful in softening the edges of this long-held idea, which is firmly fixed in the popular mind even now that the weight of accepted scholarship (the results of which are still not included in popular writings, movies, or TV treatments) is contrary to the idea.</p>
<p>Wiki has a pretty good discussion of functionalism vs. intentionalism, functionalism being the increasingly prevalent academic view that the greatest atrocities committed against Jews during WWII were not originally planned or intended, but were triggered by conditions that  developed during the war, and intentionalism being the traditional view that those atrocities were in fact intended and planned from the beginning.</p>

<p>If the great mass of Jews continue to believe that whites can at any moment decide to exterminate them, despite the evidence that such an intention has never developed, it will be very long indeed before the mass of Jews give up their support of third world immigration, special privileges for blacks, and all the other destructive measures that so many Jews feel are necessary to have the kind of society that guards their own self-preservation.</p>

		<p>I was thinking, The conflict is not racial.<br>
It is about pursuing excellence.</p>
<p>But, yet, apparently, the concept of excellence is different between Blacks and Whites. Or perhaps what is different is what is required to achieve excellence, and the amount of individual effort toward that end.</p>
<p>With us, it is an individual thing.</p>
<p>With them, it takes a village.</p>
<p>So, it is about race.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And it is the ongoing racial animus by blacks and Hispanics&hellip;but especially blacks&hellip;. towards whites and all things white; the growing threat to white middle class values, culture and history; the shift of white wealth to black incompetents; and the impending doom created by out-of-control spending and reckless, greedy lending practices to non-whites, that is causing a unification in white power that was never there before.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the way the Tea Partiers are going out of their way to find a &#8220;person of color&#8221; to slobber over for fear of being tagged racist, I cannot say that there is a unification of white power &hellip; yet.  I will say that there is a growing cohesion of white consciousness evolving from the relentless determination of the Obama Administration and its lapdog press to put a Neo-Nazi klansman into the Tea Party&rsquo;s closet if they can&rsquo;t find one there.  Case in point, the spitting non-incident reported by Rep. Cleaver of Missouri whose canine like ability to pick up sounds invisible to the human ear or most state of the art recording device when it comes to the &#8220;N&#8221; word is uncanny.  </p>
<p>The Tea Party is the last chance &#8220;people of color&#8221; have for a civil discourse about politics with White people in the country.  Once a unified white consciousness coalesces around the realization that &#8220;people of color&#8221;  and the Marxist Rainbow political elite are hell-bent on totally dispossessing them of their country, their property, and their rights and reducing them to abject serfdom, leaving them no quarter at all, we will see a true white power movement in this country.  </p>
<p>Take the November elections.  As the black former O.J. Simpson prosecutor, Christopher Darden noted, whites don&rsquo;t wreak havoc in the streets; they riot in the ballot box.   The big test is going to be in November.  Will this administration attempt to cancel out our votes by amnestying illegal aliens? Will this administration precipitate some crisis to altogether suspend the elections?  I don&rsquo;t believe, for one minute, that these spontaneous flash mobs of urban youths springing up in White enclaves are a coincidence.   The New Black Panthers were not prosecuted for their blatant attempts to intimidate Whites into not voting in Philadelphia by Eric Holder.   Not to mention the in-your-face election fraud engineered by ACORN.  Moreover, how accurately will those Diebold machines count the ballots?</p>
<p>I will put out a warning to whatever government monitors are reading this board.  Mestizos have this nasty habit of running their own candidates against established incumbents (white or black) and replacing them with their own.  They are a sensible people who recognize the stupidity of re-electing people who have a proven record of stabbing their constituents in the back.</p>
<p>Second, I predict that, if the elections are suspended, then Obama isn&rsquo;t going to need a Congress at all, not even to rubber stamp anything he wants to do.  I imagine he has commissars in place to do that.  <br>

True occultists speak of this as an ageless battle between unseen Powers rather than as a local skirmish between factions or peoples.  Bear in mind that the real nation is that of spirit not geography, and that this invisible domain is one in which the supposed victims of colonialism will never be fit to reside.

<p>Please wake up and see reality.  You cannot separate race from the &#8220;issues&#8221; you mention.  I hate to put it so crassly to your sensibility, but take away blacks and Hispanics, and none of the issues remain.  Also, note that what truly holds a people together is its race or ethnicity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to point out what should be the glaringly obvious fact that the two primary organized, and well-funded, anti-White organizations in America (and their tentacles also reach out across the globe and into every majority White European nation)are #1: The Anti-Defamation League of B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith, and #2: The $outhern Poverty Law Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These two anti-white, subversive organizations are not funded or heavily staffed with the Blacks or Mestizos that Mr. Ranger inaccurately assigns blame to, for being opposed to &lsquo;all things white&rsquo;.</p>
<p>ranger:  Better re-read the post again, because your argument not only fails to refute anything I wrote it doesn&rsquo;t even address the facts I raised which are correct.</p>
<p>Raising the point of priority has absolutely nothing to do with the accuracy of my statement.  I don&rsquo;t mind debating a point, but it&rsquo;s pointless with someone who is lacking in logic and adresses points not raised and raises points that have nothing to do with the crux of the argument.</p>
<p>The unification of this white movement very definitely has everything to do with racial animnus by non-whites, first and foremost.  If the ADL and SPLC have anything to do with it, it isn&rsquo;t much.  Definitely they play a roll in maligning whites everywhere, but it is non-white racial animus that has unified those like the tea party, etc.  </p>
<p>Why you even thought it important to bring up the SPLC or the ADL reveals how far off the mark your thinking is.  And&hellip;please&hellip;.don&rsquo;t lecture anybody on this site about the SPLC and the ADL.  We&rsquo;ve been thoroughly debating these two organizations long before you got on here.</p>

Numerous posters have repeatedly pointed out that the government that has betrayed us for decades is White, or written on self-hating White multi-cults, or pointed out that the MSM and the schools and colleges that spew anti-White propaganda are run by Whites.  But I think that many White Nationalists would like to salvage as many of our foolish brethren as possible.  I do think that most adult Whites share many of our attitudes, if not our specific beliefs.  Even most liberals are, in fact, racially aware.  Note how they segregate themselves from Blacks and Mexicans in their decisions about house-buying and their children&rsquo;s schools.  In the event of major social unrest, they would see just how much their amigos and brothers love them.  Their dreams of protecting their little minority buddies from those evil racists will not come true, it will be the liberals who need protecting.  They will be cornered, and hopefully it will concentrate their minds.  </p>
