<h1>Spelman Gets $1 Million to Produce Engineers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Diamond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, April 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Spelman College received a $1 million grant to increase the number of engineers who are black women, officials announced Friday.</p>
<p>The grant from ExxonMobil will allow the college to offer scholarships to women interested in technology-related programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The historically black women&rsquo;s college is already ranked as one of the leading producers of black females who go on to earn doctoral degrees in science and engineering.</p>

		<p>It won&rsquo;t help.  Industry is giving what had been high-paying science and engineering jobs to H-1bs from India and Pakistan because they can pay them less than what Americans expect.  The grotesuely short-sighted policy means Americans are less willing then ever to study these (difficult) fields, and that Americans forced out of these upper-middle-class jobs will earn less over their lives and purchase fewer of the products these same companies produce.  In addition, they will be able to save less for retirement in 401(k) and IRA plans, which will shrink the amount of investment capital available to the corporations.  What these corporate plutocrats are doing is the equivalent of strip-mining a fertile orchard, and they simply don&rsquo;t care as long as they can take thirty pieces of silver as their cut.</p>
<p>ExonMobil throwing a million dollars around on this is simply an attempt to disguise an economic and scientific trainwreck for the American people.</p>

		<p>Great! Having black women with attitudes and affirmative action candidates to a company I presently own stock in really makes me happy and confident.  While we&rsquo;re at it, I demand these things from the Civil Rights Industry: I want mentally retarded people to be cops.  I want midgets to be security gaurds.  I want handicapped people to be marathon runners.  I mean, it&rsquo;s all about diversity, right?</p>

<p>Yes, and what a shame it is that their certification amounts to about a high school diploma, if we want to be generous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to &#8220;produce&#8221; certification for any black in any subject if the college is willing to certify them.</p>
<p>Academia and America in general is living no more than what amounts to a myriad of lies and gross deceptions.</p>

		<p>This has to be some sort of bad joke. Exxon is absolutely throwing away their money. Spelman College has no accredited engineering program. The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, ABET, was formed by 7 engineering societies including ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers), ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) and 5 others. This represents the gold standard of accreditation. Students who do not graduate from a ABET accredited school cannot become licensed as PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS. In some states is illegal to even call yourself an engineer if you are not professionally licensed. </p>
<p>ABET accredits engineering programs at schools such as MIT, Stanford, Georgia Tech, Cal Tech, Univ of Michigan, Univ of Alabama, Auburn Univ and others. But it does not accredit Spelman. </p>

		<p>Many years ago, I was submitted for a position with Exxon.  I was not even considered as I was told that to be considered one had to have graduated in the top one percent of ones graduating college class. That was for any job at Exxon.</p>
<p>I already had the field experience they were looking for.  But that was their loss, not mine.</p>
<p>As many times as I have been stiffed by various oil companies on invoices submitted for work done, I don&rsquo;t think I would really care if Obammy nationalizes the oil industry in this country.  Of course, we will all be walking to and fro as there will be no gas in the pumps after Obammy Oil comes into play.  He wants us to all ride bicycles everywhere.</p>

		<p>Well I am not that opposed to this.  I find it acceptable when well-known companies around the world encourage young black women to work harder while they are in school, and possibly become the type of engineers who can truly contribute to our science.  If the black women do work hard while they are in school, and grandaute and find a stable career and ultimately lead a stable life, we might see a decrese in the number of black single mothers with 5+ children (with five different fathers) whom the government must support financially.  Educated black females are more likely to lead normal married lives that the government do not have to pay through the nose to support&hellip; </p>
<p>I am most ticked off when authorities in Toronto suddenly become very very reluctant and very busy coming up with excuses that they cannot do anything when the possible perpetrators are black men, because they are afraid of being labeled as racists&hellip;. or when the media suddenly becomes deafening silent when the criminals are blacks or immigrants from certain parts of the world.  </p>

		<p>People with an average IQ deficit of 15-20 points below other races are not likely candidates for engineering degrees.  While there might be the occasional exceptions, trying to create engineers from a group with substantially subpar intellect is a sure formula for frustation and failure for all concerned.</p>

		<p>Oh yeah, seeking out for preferential hiring black women full of attitude and drama but absent of real engineering knowledge.  That will work well.  Anybody remember three mile island?  Met Ed was determined to hire women.  Rejected well qualified male graduates out of hand.  They wanted women to train as reactor operators. The reactor operator during that fiasco was hired simply because she was a woman.  And didn&rsquo;t know squat in class, being carried in homework and test preparation by a gullible male who hoped for sexual favors.  He never got any, and SHE never got the material, but managed to pass in the lowest quartile of graduates.  And was hired by Met Ed over better candidates simply because she had the right genitalia.  So Exxon seeks black females for hiring?  The only knowledge of petroleum those women will know about or understand is that which is applied to the heads of their male counterparts in attempts to straighten out the kinks.</p>

A million bucks is chump change to these people, but it does buy some sort of credence in the eyes of politically correct fascists who like to shake down corporations.

		<p>As an ex-engineer, I&rsquo;ve only seen one female black engineer and she was less than useless. I foresee future American engineering departments consisting of only minorities and H-1b&rsquo;s, with the latter doing all the work at subsistence wages.</p>
<p>I would advise any intelligent white male student to avoid the field, since he would face poor job prospects, and even if he did find a job, it could soon be shipped overseas or he would be replaced by a H-1b or and L-1 visa holder once he gained experience and became &#8220;too expensive&#8221; (as happened to me).</p>

		<p>What kind of IQ does one need to be a competent engineer?  Minimum of 130 would be my guess which discounts the vast majority of blacks, male or female, whose average IQ is 85.</p>
<p>I also see the end of NASA and any space exploration as NASA is under orders to &#8216;diversify&rsquo; which means White males with 150+ IQs and solid degrees in engineering and physics from top-rate universities are locked out of careers in favor of &#8216;black women graduates from Spelman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure these highly qualified women will lead the way in engineering design, space telemetry, the physics of acceleration, the art of mixing rocket fuels.  I expect a lot A LOT more space disasters and engineering failures due to human error.</p>
<p>The last White male in my family with a PHd in physics from an ivy league school spent over two years hunting for a university appointment  &mdash;  which he never found.  He says he was lucky, very lucky, to find a position with a small, unknown boutique school in an out of the way part of the country  &mdash;  and this was 30 years ago, I imagine it is even worse today. </p>

<p>I believe that locking White males out of engineering and science careers is to not only deny White males middle-class jobs and income but also to prevent them from achieving any kind of status.</p>
<p>What do I tell my highly intelligent 16 year old when he says he wants to be a scientist?  What do I tell him about his dream to join NASA to work on deep space probes?  Or when he says he&rsquo;s thinking about majoring in chemical engineering and its applications?  Or perhaps, he says, he&rsquo;ll study and research the intricacies and locked world of viruses and prions?  Other days he wants to study Free Market, non-keyesian Economics.</p>
<p>Our smart White children are denied these opportunities, even though all major medical, engineering and scientific breakthroughs and advances have come from our people.</p>
<p>This is part of the accelerating War on Whites.  All part of the set up to marginalize us, strip us of our wealth and land, debase us, render us completely helpless and then eliminate us as we will be labeled as &#8216;surplus population.&rsquo; </p>

		<p>I graduated from UCSB and UM Ann Arbor with degrees of BS Nuclear Engineering and MS Nuclear Engineering respectively.  There were no black males in ANY of my classes, let alone black females.</p>
<p>The vast majority of blacks on those campuses were majoring in Critical Studies (Race/Gender/Sexuality stuff).</p>
<p>In order to graduate with a degree in engineering, students will have to master the calculus.  They will then be required to learn how to solve differential equations.  They will also have to understand thermodynamics, physics, and rudimentary chemistry.  None of these fields of study are particularly &#8216;simple&rsquo;, and therefore require a significant, sustained effort to master.  You cannot fake your way through a final exam in any of the hard sciences, as the answers are objectively true or false.</p>
<p>I have worked as an engineer at numerous corporations, large and small, over the past 25 years.  In all these years, I&rsquo;ve worked with 1 mulatto.  One.  And he&rsquo;s not really an engineer but rather a hardware technician.</p>
<p>Surely there are black engineers out there, but they are exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>The breakdown at most corporations is Indians, Asians (Chinese/Japanese/Koreans), White (American/Western European/Russian/Jewish), other, in that order.</p>

<p>Actually, educated black females are not very likely to be married at all, due to the dearth of qualified (equal or better education and career) black men. As well, most men, even a good proportion of black men, are not atracted to black women. And men in general don&rsquo;t find the career oriented woman attractive, not for a long term relationship or marriage.</p>
<p>Other than that, I can just imagine the drama queen attitude in a career field that requires much knowledge, study and hard work (I know, my father was a EE with a degree from Purdue, and I have worked in electronic test engineering). I can also imagine, like the comment about Three Mile Island, major engineering disasters caused by defective engineering by AA recruits.</p>

<p>Spelman College was very much a creation of Rockefeller money. It is in fact named for Laura Spelman, the wife of John D. Rockefeller.  It seems that Bill and Melinda Gates are not at all originals in their fawning upon blacks.</p>

[from Wiki]<br>
Oread Institute was a women&rsquo;s college founded in  Massachusetts in 1849.  It is thought to be the first institution of its kind exclusively for women in the country.</p>
<p>Two graduates of Oread eventually founded Spelman College, named after Oread graduate Laura Spelman Rockefeller. Laura Spelman became the (future) wife of John D. Rockefeller.  One of her instructors had been the abolitionist John Brown,  and her parents were longtime activists in the anti-slavery movement. </p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Spelman College, in Georgia, which  holds the distinction of being America&rsquo;s oldest historically black college for women.was founded  in 1881 as the  &#8220;Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary&#8221;.    It was founded in the basement of Friendship Baptist Church in Atlanta,  by two teachers from the Oread Institute  in  Massachusetts,  with $100 given to them by a church congregation in Medford, Massachusetts. </p>
<p><br>
In 1882,   the two women returned to Massachusetts to bid for more money and were introduced to wealthy businessman John D. Rockefeller.</p>
<p>The American Baptist Home Mission Society (parent of the women&rsquo;s society) made a down payment on a permanent site for the school in 1882, and early in 1883 the school moved to its new home. The balance due was paid by John D. Rockefeller, who in 1884 visited the school and settled the debt on the property.   The name of the school was changed to the Spelman Seminary in honor of Laura Spelman, an Oread student and wife of John D. Rockefeller   who helped to fund the school.  Rockefeller also donated the funds for what is currently the oldest building on campus, Rockefeller Hall. </p>
<p>In 1924, Spelman Seminary became Spelman College. Spelman also solidified its affiliation with Morehouse College and Atlanta University . </p>
<p>In 1927, one of the most important buildings on campus, Sisters Chapel, was dedicated. The chapel was named for its primary benefactors, Laura Spelman Rockefeller and Lucy Maria Spelman.  </p>
<p>Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Building, completed in 1918, is named after Laura Spelman Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller&rsquo;s wife, who was a primary contributor to Spelman. It now houses the Marian Wright Edelman Child Development Center, and also provides a student residence hall. It is typically referred to as &#8220;Laura Spelman&#8221; to avoid confusion with  <b>the many other buildings named after Rockefeller&rsquo;s relatives. </b></p>
<p>Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Hall  (commonly called &#8216;Abby&rsquo; by students)   was built in 1952 and serves as a freshman residence hall. The hall was named for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.</p>
<p>John D. Rockefeller, Jr.  Fine Arts Building was completed in 1964 and houses the Departments of Music and Drama.</p>

Wow, way to earn that &#8220;degree&#8221;!</p>

		<p>FYI, Spelman students take engineering classes at Georgia Tech. This is a five year program. At the conclusion, the student is awarded degrees from both Spelman and Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>Unless said &#8220;student&#8221; is  black, then it is a 3 month course with a degree GIVEN simply for attendance and we here all know it!</p>

		<p>I have posted similar comments before, but seriously if a Black female has the intelligence to be a mediocre engineer, she has the intelligence to use her capabilities in a more rewarding field: law, medicine, management, &#8220;education&#8221;, etc. I am sure Condolezza Rice could have been a good engineer, but she never would have gotten as far as she did in education and governmenting. </p>
<p>I agree with the comments that this is a scheme to damage White men, not to help Black women.</p>

		<p>The naysayers  above  should  at  least  approach  the issue  discussed empirically. Georgia  Tech  has  no  obligation to award engineering  degrees  to  black  females from Spelman. The  fact  that  this  long-standing  program(Spelman-GT) has  not  ben  discontined  proves the  point  that those  black females who  graduate from  the  Spelman-GT program have  passed  muster.</p>
<p>Another  way  to  prove or  disprove the hypothesis  that  black  female  Spelman-GT graduates are competent  would  be  to  do  cohort  studies  to  determine the  career  paths  of those involved. The  truth  is  that the  vast  majority  have  had and  are  having  successful careers. </p>

		<p>Working in the human resources section, we used to laugh in our company whenever a Black female would proudly show an A.S. degree. We jokingly referred to it as an Applied Stupidity degree&hellip; for obvious reasons. Invariably, the Black female could barely qualify at high school level.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of them DO have &#8220;successful careers,&#8221; thanks to the fact that black women boost both your race and gender employment and promotion stats.  So, thanks to affirmative action, they do have &#8220;successful careers.&#8221;</p>

		<p>#34, sad but true. What times we live in. A competent president that happens to be black? I don&rsquo;t mind that; A incompetent socialist oaf who&rsquo;s in bed with wallstreet who was only voted in because he was black? That speaks multitudes of the deranged attitudes of people these days. Assuming you are trying to take a shot at me, then that probably includes you. If thats not the case then I apologize in advance for my brashness</p>
