<h1>4 Decapitated Bodies Hung From Bridge in Mexico</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Oswald Alonso, San Diego Union-Tribune, August 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The decapitated bodies of four men were hung from a bridge Sunday in this central Mexican city besieged by fighting between two drug lords.</p>
<p>A gang led by kingpin Hector Beltran Leyva took responsibility for the killings in a message left with the bodies, the attorney general&rsquo;s office of Morelos state said in a statement.</p>
<p>The beheaded and mutilated bodies were hung by their feet early Sunday from the bridge in Cuernavaca, a popular weekend getaway for Mexico City residents.</p>
<p>Cuernavaca has become a battleground for control of the Beltran Leyva cartel since its leader, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed there in a December shootout with marines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Guerrero state has been wracked by drug-gang violence, including the strife within the Beltran Leyva cartel. There have also been a series of deadly carjackings this year along highways in the state.</p>
<p>Mexico has seen unprecedented gang violence since President Felipe Calderon stepped up the fight against drug trafficking when he took office in December 2006, deploying thousands of troops and federal police to cartel strongholds.</p>
<p>Since then, more than 28,000 people have been killed in violence tied to Mexico&rsquo;s drug war.<br>

		<p>Will these people ever breach the glass ceiling that takes them out of the lifestyle of drugs as sole source income?  Do they even want to?</p>
<p>Pablo Escobar, cheap piece of dirt that he was, at least was in the habit of buying loyalty by setting up schools and funding the uplift of some of El Salvador&rsquo;s poorest areas as PR tactic.  I have to wonder if any of these honchos sees their future in a dead relative&rsquo;s surprised eyes.</p>
<p>We are talking HUNDREDS of millions every year.  If they would invest 10% of a single year for themselves, their lives would be assured.  If they would invest 20-30% for their people (so their own kids could walk to school, safely) they would be building a dynasty.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it.  I don&rsquo;t see why, at this point, the control over the traffic itself cannot be locked down.  People living from house to house on a nightly basis don&rsquo;t have the best command and control apparatus while the routes and factories and personalities of the actual smuggling have to remain constant&hellip;</p>

<p>Kind of makes you wonder what the UN-popular weekend getaways are like. Plenty of beheadings, but not as easy to find store-validated parking? <br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a book titled, &#8220;Race And Manifest Destiny&#8221; by Reginald Horsman.  In a chapter describing congressional debate over expanding into New Mexico and California, a Whig party member argued that &#8220;they are inhabited by a mixed population, of habits, opinions, and characters incapable of sympathy or assimilation with our own; a race, whom the experience of an entire generation has proved to be unfitted for self-government, and unprepared to appreciate, sustain, or enjoy free institutions.&#8221;  Over 150 years later those words remain true.</p>

Yet, we will never have any &#8220;reports&#8221; of these facts from a segment on a Glenn Beck show will we? Even our Founders knew very well that America would never be sustainable with any race different from our own. Do we ever hear any so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; ever speak any of these truths? Levin? Nope. Hannity? Nope. It is like some virus has come along and wiped out sanity, reason and truths from the White race the world over.</p>

		<p>#6.  Jefferson wrote the same about the black race; He described the very dilemma we are facing today in detail.  The hatred, resentment, the reparations, the lifeline they need.</p>
<p>When our soldiers stood in the Halls of Montezuma and Mexico was conquered the USA didn&rsquo;t want it for the reasons given.  What has changed?  Nothing apart from the deterioration of our government, our principles, our standards of living.</p>
<p>We have changed - they haven&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>They beheaded the four men but didn&rsquo;t field-dress them?  The narcos must have been in a hurry.  If this is happening in resort towns now, one can only imagine the horrors of the countryside.</p>
<p>The article mentioned 28,000 killed in the Mexican drug war in the last four years.  This is about the same KIA rate US forces suffered during in Vietnam (approximately 8 years of major involvement, and approximately twice as many KIA).</p>

		<p>@3: &#8220;Hung&#8221; is a correct past tense and past participle of &#8220;hang.&#8221; In the sense of &#8220;put to death by hanging,&#8221; most people prefer to use &#8220;hanged,&#8221; but these bodies were already dead when they were hung (passive voice), and certainly while they hung (active voice, intransitive). Gotcha! :)<br>

		<p>Anonymous is right about guys like Levin and Beck not framing the problems in this country at the root cause, race.  Race, and the denial of race differences has brought down our educational system.  We&rsquo;ve dumbed down the standards in testing and grading, sometimes eliminating grades altogether, in order to prove this national fairytale that claims we are all equal.  We&rsquo;ve forced banks to give mortgages to people who couldn&rsquo;t afford them in order to prove all people are capable of achieving the american dream of home ownership.  Credit card companies couldn&rsquo;t turn down deadbeats, so they gouged the responsable to cover the irresponsable.  Employers in just about every industry have been forced to hire and retain inferior workers or face legal and or financial reprisal.  I used to think it was just the Post Office that was crashing because of Affirmative Action, but it&rsquo;s the same story in every industry.  Race is at the root of most of this country&rsquo;s problems and I share Anonymous&rsquo;s frustration with the Right wing talking heads reluctance to acknowledge that.  I do however, hear these guys saying things nobody with a major national audience was saying 10 or even 5 years ago.  So, I think things are moving in the right direction, if not as quickly as we would like.  This President is putting the realities of race into the faces of everyday people who would never have considered a visit to the AR website and would have run the other way if any of us had tried to convince them that this national fairytale we&rsquo;ve been living under for the past 50 years is nonsense.  Thanks to Obama, a lot of quilt-ridden Whites are starting to see that the emperor has no clothes and guys like Levin and Beck are going to have to tell it like it is about race or lose credibility with their audience, an audience they are in stiff competition to hold.</p>
