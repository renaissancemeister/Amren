			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Karoub, AOL News, August 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illuminated by the night lights on the football field, Adnan Restum joined a scrum of teammates at the end-zone water fountain, taking a break from a grueling preseason football workout to guzzle a drink.</p>
<p>In just a few hours, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take a sip. But the 17-year-old defensive tackle could rehydrate guilt-free during the 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. practice, and succumb to tempting boxes full of granola bars and chocolate milk, too.</p>
<p>The moonlight practice is tailored for Restum and fellow Muslim teammates who make up a majority of the Fordson High School squad in the large Arab community of Dearborn. It&rsquo;s a way for the players to practice football and their faith, and balance the fasting common during the 30-day holy month of Ramadan that started last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fordson High&rsquo;s head coach Fouad Zaban proposed reversing the clock and moving practice to nighttime after realizing the rotating Ramadan would fall squarely during the start of a two-a-day practice schedule that launches football season.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zaban, 40, a Muslim and former Fordson player, knows the high stakes. When Ramadan falls during football season, the players practice during daylight hours. But with August&rsquo;s heat and doubled practice schedule, concerns grew about players&rsquo; health, particularly the high risk of heat stroke.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know how hot it&rsquo;s been this summer  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s not safe,&#8221; Zaban said.</p>
<p>Working it out meant getting the approval of school and district administrators and the blessings of players, parents and police. Then, there were the residents in the surrounding neighborhood, who would hear more noise and see the illuminated field. So he sent letters explaining the decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zaban said the goal has been to let players break the fast at sundown and go to the mosque, and get players out in time for a meal and morning prayer before sunrise. The field is near bustling bakeries, cafes and restaurants catering to late-night customers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zaban said whether players fast is a personal choice and never an issue raised by him or his staff. Still, he says, it shouldn&rsquo;t be an excuse for poor performance for the roughly 95 percent who do.</p>
<p>He ended the session before 4 a.m. with a message to the huddled, padded masses to &#8220;drink lots of water,&#8221; &#8220;get a good meal in,&#8221; and &#8220;man up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Defensive tackle William Powell, one of the team&rsquo;s few non-Muslims, initially thought the coach was &#8220;out of his mind,&#8221; but he&rsquo;s come around. In fact, he&rsquo;s even fasted.</p>

<p>Am I being trivial here? Obviously, that is my instantaneous and intuitive reaction. </p>
<p>&#8220;Coach&#8221; is really setting a good example for his charges. Sports or no sports, violation of the law, however trivial and minor, is NEVER a good idea.</p>

		<p>The article states in passing that the team won all of one game last season.  Is it any wonder why they&rsquo;re so bad, if during one month of the season, the team&rsquo;s players can&rsquo;t eat or drink when the sun is up?  Those must be some really scrawny guys.  Ramadan always falls somewhere during football season, but depending on the Muslim lunar-solar calendar, it might be as soon as around the start of practice, like this year, or it might be toward the end of the season.  Either way, their grades must not be anything to write Allah about, if they&rsquo;re up to 4 every night for practice for about a month.</p>

		<p>Go to the original article if you want to see how poorly informed the sports watching public is.</p>
<p>They have no concept of what an Islamic future would mean for this country.</p>
<p>Some seem to profess a knowledge of the Bible, but fall far short in their quotations.  They don&rsquo;t seem to be aware of New Testament teachings that supersede the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Their ignorance and lack of insight is appalling. </p>
<p>This country is in a world of hurt.</p>

		<p>I actually have no problem with this if a large percentage of the community is Muslim. It is respectful to that community&rsquo;s population. But this is another good reason for homogenous communities. I am becoming a firm believer in the City State system where each small community makes their own rules.  </p>

		<p>And normal daylight (school) activities, restoring conventional circadians and taking account the fact that teenagers are second only to newborns in the -added- amounts of sleep they need?</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&#8220;I&rsquo;m around &#8216;em, so I&rsquo;ve tried a couple times but it&rsquo;s hard,&#8221; the 17-year-old said.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>No doubt, since you are now officially decarbing your body at a time when your brain, which _ordinarily_ consumes 250 calories a day may be up around 500 or more TRYING TO LEARN.</p>
<p>Your ancestors paid a huge metabolic penalty to give you that big brain sir.  Don&rsquo;t let some fools regional religious concept of &#8216;what&rsquo;s right&rsquo; drive you to stupidly ignore biology 101.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
With that, he walked off the field and into the darkness with plans to grab a quick bite with friends at a local bakery.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how hot it was this summer, this is not the Middle East where people do business at night because the daytemps approach 120`F.  This kid has _no business_ being out past curfew because, golly wally, his religion conflicts with it being a school day tomorrow.</p>
<p>So sorry, but I don&rsquo;t need to see Highschool Football Islamicized and celebrated for it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure Dearborn isn&rsquo;t thrilled either.  They&rsquo;ve just caved to the point where &#8216;as long as they do it only for themselves&rsquo; allows them to retreat from the tradition of an American Sport where -team play- rules and only a minority (supposedly) on the team is Christian or a member of a founder population group without these insanely stupid ideas.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I also find it exceptionally unlikely that a bunch of Middle Eastern ethnies have the muscle or bone density to &#8216;man up&rsquo; compared to other likely candidates within the school but even if they do, that&rsquo;s not what they are there for and burning the vapor sodium lamps to give them a taste of Sports &#8216;as Allah intended&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that this is a school and nobody who goes home at dawn after a 5 hour practice session is going to be worth a damn three hours later for school.</p>

		<p>I wonder if they will have a problem with the football being made of pig skin.  I think they&rsquo;re made of pig skin.  If they are, they probably won&rsquo;t be for long.  What then?  If we make them out of cow hide, we stand a chance of offending Hindus.  Well, if it comes up, let&rsquo;s just make those footballs out of marshmellow.  And while we&rsquo;re changing the game, let&rsquo;s do away with keeping score too.  That way we won&rsquo;t have any loosers.  Hey! I wonder if their chearleaders wear burkas.  Wouldn&rsquo;t that be something to see?</p>

<p>Wait, so Muslims are allowed to pray on school property, but the rest of us aren&rsquo;t? That doesn&rsquo;t seem fair at all, but then again Muslims have been getting a lot of unnecessary preferential treatment lately.</p>

		<p>When I told people that Obama was a Muslim, albeit a secular one with sympathies toward believers and the faith&rsquo;s secular, not theological ideals - people laughed. Too bad I can&rsquo;t direct them to AmRen for PC reasons but it&rsquo;s entirely obvious that Islamization has just begun. Time to read up on &#8216;jiziya&rsquo; because if you think you&rsquo;re overtaxed today, well&hellip; If White Resisters convert to Orthodox Christianity, your spiritual cohesion will keep you alive.

<p>Precisely.   This is how it begins. A little concession here, another small one there. When those become accepted as commonplace, there will be demands for still more. One nibble at a time.</p>
<p>Only 20 or 30 years ago, this will never have been believed. Now, it&rsquo;s a precedent, and doubtless other schools across America will begin to follow it. </p>

		<p>This insanity is promoting a new type and direction of education.</p>
<p>Soon there will be only home schooling and tele-schooling. Home schooling is firmly entrenched here in Georgia, and tele-schooling is beginning to take hold, partly on the pretext of saving gas, traffic congestion and utilities/expenses of a physical presence in the building. The only difference between the two is that home schooling involves parents paying for an actual education from a private institution, and tele-schooling just lets students fail from home.</p>

		<p>More proof that Islam is not a religion but a political cult for crazy people. Accordingly, this murderous ideology should not be allowed to hide behind the wall of religion. It&rsquo;s like saying Nazis are part of the Nazi religion and thus they can skip work to hold their religious rallies.</p>
<p>Besides, common sense dictates that fasting from sun up to sun down for an entire month - not even being &#8220;allowed&#8221; water - is tantamount to lunacy. No wonder nothing gets done in Muslim nations. </p>
<p>As for this football team, I suggest the players decide between their &#8220;religion&#8221; or a normal American schedule for school and practice. They can&rsquo;t have it both ways and we certainly should not let them have it both ways.</p>

Exactly!  What suited their native locale and climate may be appropriate to them, but it is absolutely not appropriate to us. Muslims are inflexible.  Would we expect Eskimos to migrate to Florida and continue living just as they had in the Arctic? </p>

<p>I think I know what&rsquo;s next   &mdash;   Their opponents, assuming their team members are comprised of infidels, will be forced, Harrison Bergeron style, to emaciate themselves for a month, so that this squad from Dearbornistan can have a &#8220;fair&#8221; fight.</p>
<p>BTW, most footballs are made of leather and rubber, not pig skin.  I heard the story once about how they came to be known as &#8220;pigskin,&#8221; but forgot it.  It had something to do with another part of the pig being used, but they stopped doing that long ago.  So at least in this part of their lives, these team members can take a clear conscious to Allah.</p>
