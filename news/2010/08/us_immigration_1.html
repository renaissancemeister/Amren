			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Miriam Jordan, Jean Guerrero, and Laura Meckler, Wall Street Journal, July 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigration-rights activists say citizenship isn&rsquo;t a significant driver of illegal immigration, because a child has to reach age 21 to petition for permanent legal residency for his or her parents.</p>
<p>Such calls to change what has been a bedrock feature of the immigration system are sure to set off contentious debate. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an extreme position, and Sen. Graham knows this,&#8221; said Angela Kelley of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. &#8220;He&rsquo;s not one to tamper with the Constitution, so I&rsquo;m surprised he would even suggest this.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Arizona, Republican state Sen. Russell Pearce, the architect of the immigration law that drew a legal challenge from the Obama administration, said he wanted to deny U.S. citizenship to children born in his state to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>At issue is the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, enacted in 1868 to ensure that states not deny former slaves the full rights of citizenship. It states: &#8220;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Graham, speaking on Fox, suggested that changing birthright-citizenship rules would require a constitutional amendment. &#8220;We should change our Constitution and say if you come here illegally and have a child, that child&rsquo;s not automatically a citizen,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said he was considering introducing such an amendment. A spokesman said Thursday that Mr. Graham was just discussing the idea and hadn&rsquo;t made any decisions about whether to move ahead.</p>
<p>Mr. Pearce, like some other proponents of the change, argued that the amendment as written doesn&rsquo;t apply to illegal immigrants. Because illegal immigrants aren&rsquo;t &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; of the U.S., as the amendment requires, they fall outside its protection, these people argue. A group of House lawmakers made a similar argument when they tried to pass legislation changing the birthright principle in 2005.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it was ratified in 1868, the amendment had to do with African-Americans; it had nothing to do with aliens,&#8221; said Mr. Pearce. &#8220;It&rsquo;s got to be fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under Mr. Pearce&rsquo;s proposal, Arizona would refuse to issue a birth certificate to any child unless at least one parent could prove legal presence in the U.S. &#8220;The 14th Amendment has been hijacked and abused,&#8221; Mr. Pearce said. &#8220;We incentivize people to break our laws.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to cleanse America of all illegal aliens and their descendents, no matter how many generations descended. But, Graham is right. You need to amend the constitution. Just passing a law to clarify the status of anchor babies won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>If we say we can arrrest illegal aliens, seize their property, deny them social benefits like medicaid,then they are de facto &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; of the Federal govt and the states, e.g., Arizona and its now shredded immigration law.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>

		<p>I am against birthright citizenship; but, to say that the 14th Amendment does not grant it to &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; is ridiculous. The fact that those who wrote, passed and ratified the amendment were not thinking of that possibility is as beside the point as the fact that the Founding Fathers were not thinking about the Internet when they wrote the First Amendment. Each amendment is still applicable as written.</p>
<p>The argument that illegal aliens are not &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; of the United States is ludicrous  &mdash;   and likewise beside the point! The fact that our jails and prisons are overflowing with illegal aliens disproves the former claim. The fact that that is likewise beside the point is proved by the 14th Amendment itself: It does not even refer to a native-born person&rsquo;s parents having been subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the United States, as of the date of the former&rsquo;s birth; it merely refers to the native-born person&rsquo;s own status. Like his or her illegal-alien parents, an &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and fully accountable under its laws, simply by being present in the United States  &mdash;   something that only those with diplomatic immunity may avoid.</p>
<p>Even Amerindians who are members of tribes that are recognized as sovereign by the United States government are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States when they are not living on a reservation; and, even on such reservations, serious crimes are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States government.</p>
<p>By all means, let us end birthright citizenship; but let us do it by the appropriate and straightforward method of amending the Constitution  &mdash;   not by concocting ad hoc claims that self-styled strict constructionists somehow manage to deliver with straight faces.</p>

		<p>Nothing will come of this. We&rsquo;re too far down the road toward total transformation.  That it&rsquo;s even discussed is a reflection of some frustration, but Whites have a habit of being frustrated and then becoming suddenly silent on issues of sovereignty and survival as soon as somebody aims the Racism word at them.</p>
<p>Nothing will change until some shyster politician in a Red State actually calls a convention to investigate how the 14th Amendment was illegally approved.<br>

		<p>The main problem I see with anchor babies is that they allow their mamas to get welfare and thus money that allows them to stay in the U.S.  If we deport these women, they can demand that their American-born children be allowed to remain in the country.  Though most women would probably not go to such extremes, the threat is always there.  I say fine, let&rsquo;s build orphanages or farm these abandoned kids out to foster homes just like we do legal unfortunates.  <br>
As for the 14th Amendment, it certainly does pertain to the freed black slaves, and courts are supposed to look at the INTENT of the law, not just whatever the words therein might mean.  Unfortunately, I think Graham and others supporting an amendment are just stalling, knowing it might easily take decades for such a measure to succeed.  Why don&rsquo;t they propose taking a case to the Supreme Court?  If that doesn&rsquo;t pan out, then an amendment initiative will of course have to go forward.</p>

<p>Of course many will. There is no reason not to think that Third World people won&rsquo;t want to hurl their children into the white countries so they may grow up the white world.</p>

		<p>JOHN C. EASTMAN is dean and Donald P. Kennedy Chair in Law at Chapman University School of Law in Orange, Calif.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt of what he wrote in the Des Moines Register in 2007 on the meaning of the &#8220;Citizenship Clause&#8221; of the 14th Amendment:</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone &#8216;born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,&rsquo; but for those who drafted and ratified the clause, &#8216;subject to the jurisdiction&rsquo; meant much more than mere territorial jurisdiction. Being born in the United States while subject to the political jurisdiction  &mdash;   the &#8216;I-pledge-allegiance-and-can-be-prosecuted-for-treason&rsquo; type of jurisdiction  &mdash;   was required. As Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland noted during floor debate at the time the clause was proposed, the citizenship clause simply provides &#8216;that all persons born in the United States and not subject to some foreign power &hellip; shall be considered as citizens of the United States.&rsquo; The author of the provision, Senator Jacob Howard, maintained that the clause &#8216;will not, of course, include foreigners.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty years after the 14th Amendment was ratified, the Supreme Court expanded the constitutional mandate slightly, holding that the children of legal, permanent residents were automatically citizens, but the court has never held that the clause also confers automatic citizenship on the children of temporary visitors, much less on the children born to those who are in this country illegally. We have simply backed into that understanding, without consideration of the actual meaning of the citizenship clause or concern about the consequences to other constitutional text and principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One such principle is the idea of government by consent. Birthright citizenship permits some to demand citizenship unilaterally, without the consent of the political community in which membership is claimed. It is therefore incompatible with a system of government based upon consent of the governed and, when utilized by those who enter this country illegally, the rule of law as well.&#8221;*</p>

		<p>How can you be &#8220;under the jurisdiction of&#8221; when you illegally enter a country?  When the country doesn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re here, until USCIS becomes aware of your illegal presence and as prescribed by law, either jails you or summarily deports you, you are not &#8220;under the jurisdiction of&#8221; the U.S.  Further, you are an alien in the U.S., a citizen subject of another country where your allegiance remains. The founders and authors of our Constitution could not have imagined how far from their ideals our country would stray, particularly in granting precious citizenship to anyone who can illegally breach our border and drop a baby  &mdash;  free of charge, I might add.  Paid for by the citizen saps that are paying taxes and, for now, still obeying the law. </p>

		<p>There is one huge difference between anchor babies and former slaves. The parents of former slaves weren&rsquo;t in the country illegally. I think the 14th amendment is being misapplied to illegals. But it&rsquo;s a controversial issue so I&rsquo;d like to see the Supreme Court settle it. In the meantime, I&rsquo;d like to see congress pass an amendment against birth right citizenship. The United States is one of the last countries to still allow birth right citizenship and it&rsquo;s high time we pulled the plug on that loophole.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Birthright citizenship&#8221; is pure insanity, which is why no country in the world except the United States has it. </p>
<p>The argument that it doesn&rsquo;t drive illegal immigration because parents can&rsquo;t apply for legal residence until the child is 21 is false for three reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, even if it hadn&rsquo;t helped the parents, parents still want that for the children. </p>
<p>Secondly, even if they have to wait 21 years, that might be better than eternity as they might not have been able to legally immigrate ever otherwise. </p>
<p>And thirdly, and most importantly, they know that immigration authorities will never deport U.S. citizens, and since they don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;break up families&#8221; either, this means that having a child born in the U.S. effectively eliminates any risk of deportation, and thus makes them de facto legal residents, even if they aren&rsquo;t so formally.</p>

<p>This is plain WHITE insanity!</p>
<p> To allow the children to even stay in any of our countries will defeat the purpose. Send all those kids back where they belong and quit letting nonwhites induce even more &#8220;White guilt&#8221; on us. And forget about that word, RACIST! It means NOTHING and they know it. They use it to disarm Whites only and we are fools to fall for it for so long! </p>
<p>Wake up, White people! You are being murdered in cold blood and so are your children. What is more important to you? YOUR children and their survival or the survival of NONwhites?  That is what it all comes down to. How weak and cowardly do we have to become before waking up to our own misguided &#8220;altruism&#8221; and our idea of &#8220;fair play&#8221;?

<p>This only applies to non-whites, of course. A friend recently had a church member from Russia get deported, leaving behind her American-born 16 year old son. She had emigrated legally, then her status changed due to a divorce, if I remember correctly. She had done all of the paperwork, jumped through all of the hoops, but in the end it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

		<p>A few of the practicals effect of this abuse of the 14th Amendment: </p>
<p>&#8220;Rising numbers of undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America are streaming into Texas to give birth, straining hospitals and costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, health officials say.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Even Houston&rsquo;s feeling the pinch. An estimated 70 percent to 80 percent of the 10,587 births at Ben Taub General Hospital and Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospital last year were to undocumented immigrants, administrators say.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Immigrants want a U.S.-born baby and know that emergency room staffers don&rsquo;t collect any money up front,&rsquo; said Dr. Mario Rodriguez, an obstetrician in Starr County.&#8221; </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>As of 2002, 10 percent of all U.S. births were to illegal alien parents, according to a Center for Immigration Studies report, &#8220;Births to Immigrants at an All-Time High&#8221; (Summer 2005). </p>

<p><br>
&#8220;A new analysis of birth records by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that in 2002 almost one in four births in the United States was to an immigrant mother (legal or illegal), the highest level in American history. In addition, nearly ten percent of all births in the country were to illegal-alien mothers.&#8221; </p>
