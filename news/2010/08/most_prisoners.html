<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Crime rates have dropped in the United States over the past 15 years, yet prison populations have soared. The U.S. incarceration rate now exceeds that of other industrialized nations by five times or more, with almost 2.3 million people behind bars and another 5 million on parole or probation.</p>
<p>A major reason for this apparent paradox has gone largely ignored, according to Harvard University sociologist Robert Sampson. Certain disadvantaged sections of cities have acted as incarceration hot spots in the midst of a general downturn in crime, Sampson reported at a press conference August 16 at the American Sociological Association&rsquo;s annual meeting.</p>
<p>Ballooning incarceration rates in these poor, predominantly black neighborhoods, especially among young men, create a sense of collective cynicism and fatalism that fuels further misconduct and imprisonment, Sampson said. He and sociology graduate student Charles Loeffler of Harvard describe their findings, based on surveys and crime-data analyses of Chicago neighborhoods, in the summer Daedalus. That issue contains research and essays inspired by an American Academy of Arts and Sciences task force on mass incarceration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mass incarceration in the United States has a deep local concentration in relatively few disadvantaged communities,&#8221; Sampson asserted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chicago crime data for 1990 to 1995 show that a large majority of prison and jail populations came from two poor, black sections of the city, Sampson and Loeffler found. During that time, overall rates of crime and violence declined in Chicago while incarceration rates rose in those two areas.</p>
<p>Following these encouraging crime reductions, Chicago officials closed massive public housing units in the two high-crime, high-incarceration areas because they were considered breeding grounds for drug dealing and violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Interviews of almost 8,000 Chicago residents between 1995 and 2002 identified intense cynicism about the legal system and hopelessness about future prospects among residents of the city&rsquo;s incarceration hot spots.</p>
<p>Teenagers and children expressed some of the grimmest attitudes. &#8220;Many kids said they didn&rsquo;t expect to live past age 25 or to avoid ending up in prison,&#8221; Sampson said.</p>
<p>Researchers need to focus on how the concentration of incarceration within certain poor neighborhoods undermines the quality of life for everyone living there, he added.</p>
<p>Not all poor neighborhoods become incarceration hot spots, Sampson emphasized. {snip}<br>

<p></p>
<p>This should read crime rates have dropped in the United States over the past 15 years BECAUSE prison populations have soared.</p>
<p><br>
This is the hypocritical nature of communism (which now uses race rather than the &#8220;proletariat&#8221; as its supposed focus).</p>
<p>Segregation is what allowed blacks to live in white lands without chaos destroying everything.  This was demonized&hellip;..yet maintained using the prison system.  The communists who are now our elites have horribly miscalculated.  They assumed they could simply remove the troublemakers from the racial populations.</p>
<p>The problem is, the number of troublemakers is infinite.  In a few short decades, they have outstripped our elites ability to selectively segregate them.</p>
<p>There is no solution except the original one&hellip;.segregation by entire population (by race).  The problem is it&rsquo;s been demonized.</p>
<p>There is question as to if the white population will adopt this solution in the short term again.  If we refuse, conflict will build and build until overt war breaks out.</p>
<p>Wars of this nature only have one historical outcome.  One groups completely annihilates the other.  Our choice is segregation or genocide.  But since those that resist segregation DO NOT UNDERSTAND that the choice is limited to these two outcomes, they will, choose the latter by refusing to choose the former.</p>
<p>One wrinkle is that a certain subset of the elites have known this outcome all along&hellip;..and promoted it.</p>

		<p>Thankfully, this is one cycle of &#8220;collective cynicism and fatalism&#8221; that is easy to break.  Don&rsquo;t commit any serious felonies.  Thanks to lenient judges and black juries, the only way you&rsquo;ll go to prison to begin with is if you&rsquo;re &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; enough to be convicted of a serious felony.  Most lighter felonies and almost all misdemeanors will only get you probation, or maybe a little bit of time in county.</p>

<p>Or it could also be that low IQ plus governmedia-implanted expectations of &#8220;equality&#8221; is what creates that &#8220;sense of collective cynicism and fatalism,&#8221; Bob.  Ever consider things from that angle?  I thought not.  But then, that&rsquo;s what happens when you let Harvard grad students &#8220;explain&#8221; a world that doesn&rsquo;t fit their high-minded preconceptions.</p>

<p>The very reason the overall crime and violence declined was probably due to the higher rate of incarceration of Chicago blacks, not from any change in the moral sense of the general population.</p>

		<p>&#8220;cynicism and fatalism&#8221;??? really? I think they are giving these people way too much credit, cynicism and fatalism are complex cerebral functions. I would attribute the chronic criminal behavior<br>
to low intelligence combined with sociopathic personalities. Lower intelligence folks are usually good citizens, and there are very intelligent sociopaths who don&rsquo;t rape rob and murder, but there is nothing more dangerous than a dumb sociopath!</p>

<p>Well, why not move toward a &ldquo;community based&rdquo; incarceration model and keep these vanguards of color local and contributing as best they can? Why not turn some fully abandoned and worthlessly diversified areas of cities into prison camps, farms so to speak, where crops and tools for the greater &ldquo;community of color&rdquo; might be realized?</p>
<p>We all know why that won&rsquo;t fly, it requires work and forethought as a singular dynamic!</p>

		<p>It goes to show you how academics of the pretend schiences are clueless about the reality of black street life.  Blacks consider it a badge of honor to have done time in the razor-wire hotel (prison). It&rsquo;s called, &#8220;street cred&#8221;. Take a bullet and survive, and you&rsquo;ve reached near hero status in the ghetto. Kill someone, and you&rsquo;ll be &#8220;da man&#8221;!</p>
<p>Academic achievement in the ghetto is called &#8220;acting white&#8221;, or in liberal-legitimized illiterate English, see also, &#8220;ebonics&#8221;, it&rsquo;s referred to as &#8220;ackin&rsquo; white&#8221;. </p>

<p>How these crimes are being reported or ignored should be investigated thoroughly.</p>
<p>It pains me to say so, but most law enforcement agencies are as politically correct as the media, since it is the politicians who really pull the strings. Everyone I&rsquo;ve ever known of is just another pack of politically correct ideologues.  It could well be that they&rsquo;re suppressing non-white crime figures.</p>

Yeah, well, either it&rsquo;s that or its low IQ; low impulse-control; rampant anti-intellectualism; a general desire to avoid work; the ghetto worship in hip-hop culture; and a half-century of Entitlement Mentality that fuels all that black misconduct and imprisonment. </p>

<p>Admitting to this only illustrates how easily they can be manipulated by outside influences.  What these neighborhoods have learned is that the idea that &#8220;bust a dealer and another will take his place&#8221; only means we&rsquo;ll build more prisons to accommodate them and the other criminals they trade with.  It&rsquo;s time for blacks in America to take a long hard look at what changes need to be made to restore their communities to sanity.  Having to support half of a race of unruly children for so many decades is wearing America thin to their cause.  I feel sorry for the 50% of blacks who aren&rsquo;t on government handouts.  They carry the reputation of every welfare queen.  Just like I carry the reputation of every slaver just by having white skin.  That&rsquo;s lesson 1, all this racial stuff cuts both ways.  Blacks need to get it together if they ever want to be respected.  Otherwise they remain America&rsquo;s problem children and a drain on national morale.<br>

		<p>The redoubtable Heather MacDonald:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the overwhelming majority of cases, whatever the race of the convicted, prison remains what it has always been: a lifetime achievement award for persistence in criminal offending. Absent recidivism or a violent crime, the criminal-justice system will do everything it can to keep you out of the state or federal slammer. It can be disconcerting for the average law-abiding citizen to hear a prosecutor&rsquo;s typology of the crime universe: most thefts, for example, are considered &#8216;nonserious crimes&rsquo; that do not merit prison sentences, unless they concern a huge amount of money or took place in the victim&rsquo;s presence. Steal an unoccupied car or burgle an unoccupied home and you&rsquo;ll probably get probation; hijack a car from a driver or stick up a pedestrian, however, and you&rsquo;ll probably go to prison.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Is the Criminal-Justice System Racist?</p>

<p>CLOSED means blasted and bulldozed flat. NO longer there at all. Built in the mid-1950&rsquo;s [Robert Taylor homes] and within about a dozen years 50 % of those apartments were unoccupied as being unliveable.</p>
<p>NOW just vacant empty space. I used to ride the commuter railroad to work everyday and pass by Taylor homes. A continuous barrage of rocks thrown with intent to hurt or even kill was a daily ordeal. And at night time gunfire all the time. Drug addled inhabitants of the &#8220;homes&#8221; firing randomly at passing commuter trains.</p>

		<p>These &#8220;poor blacks&#8221; should consider enlisting in the Army where so many other ghetto blacks have found a welfare check with a uniform. The Army also gives them easy jobs, they CANNOT be fired or diciplined, they have easy access to White women and can harrass said women without fear of punishment!p.s. they also get a weapon which they are allowed to carry around over here. A more sinister thing happening in Afghanistan though is the practice of using ARMED Afghan police or Army as ECP (entry control points) guards! these armed Afghans NEVER END WELL on camps where they are used, with few exception, they have turned on us and killed us, it is only a matter of timing NOT IF it will happen.</p>

		<p>Please, have some pity for a white man, Robert Sampson, who is trying to survive in a hostile environment (Harvard sociology department). If he wrote a scientifically correct (and polically incorrect) paper about the causes of high incarceration rates in certain neighborhoods, he would be lucky to get a night managers job at a fast food outlet. He would be disqualified from holding any Sociological position.</p>

		<p>If we changed the welfare system such that EVERY american who earns less than 200k a year gets 10k from the government, and can do anything they want with it, blacks would wake up. No more food stamps, no more schip, no more free health care. thats it, 10 k. spend it how you will. And you have to be 21 to collect it. </p>
<p>renting ONE ROOM in a major city will run you 500 bucks. that leavs you 300 dollars for food each month. If you want to have 12 chillin then so be it the dollars dont change. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hard working people can use that money to start companies, to invest, etc. There should be no taxes at all if you earn less than 200k per year. </p>
<p>Finally everyone is on the same playing field. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this comment will make it on the discussion board but my only food for thought is that I have a question for the Black Community: &#8220;Your continuing response to lower scores in education, out of wedlock births, unemployment and incarceration rates continues to be blamed on racism coming from White America. Why is it that over sixty years ago (those racist 50&rsquo;s) the marriage, college graduation and overall wellness of your race was better during the &#8220;supposed&#8221; worst racist, jim crow time of the Civil Rights movement? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from East Texas and witnessed firsthand in school watching Blacks(and other minorities) trying to take the hard advanced courses in Math and Science to better themselves only to be ridiculed by members of their own race for &#8220;acting White&#8221;. Where is a race headed with that kind of encouragement?? It&rsquo;s pathetic plain and simple. Spokesmen like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton continue to prosper on this racist myth while men like Bill Cosby get crucified for telling the truth. Pull yourself up and be somebody like the rest of us have to do. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Researchers need to focus on how the concentration of incarceration within certain poor neighborhoods undermines the quality of life for everyone living there, he added.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would the quality of life improve if those who commit the crimes remained in the neighborhood?</p>
<p>This is such a touchy issue.  If white cops arrest nonwhites in minority neighborhoods, everyone says racism.  If nonwhite cops do the say, they say police brutality.</p>
<p>If crime is high, the nonwhites say they have been abandoned by the city.  If policing rises to meet the challenge, the same nonwhites complain of frisking, stops and racial profiling. </p>
<p>They are never happy no matter what you do.</p>
<p>Notice how in white communities no one talks about police brutality, racism, etc, even if some of the cops are nonwhite.  Then again, there are far fewer violent crimes in white areas, even in poor white areas.</p>
<p>If I were a white cop in a minority area, I would be tempted to not really police too closely in the interest of personal safety and job security.  I wonder how much of this goes on.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Not all poor neighborhoods become incarceration hot spots, Sampson emphasized. In earlier research, he and his colleagues found a link between reduced violence in some poor Chicago areas and a willingness among neighbors to act as mentors to local children and otherwise intervene on behalf of the common good.&#8221; <br>

The author should have told us about the racial composition of these neighborhoods.  </p>

		<p>I note that Sampson called areas with high incarceration rates &#8220;disadvantaged.&#8221; Funny how many of these neighborhoods used to be &#8220;advantaged&#8221; and often even upper middle-class areas. Their disadvantage arose from the gradually increasing influx of blacks and Hispanics, whose criminal activities finally turned a process of displacement into an all-out rout of the family-oriented whites who&rsquo;d created these areas in the first place.  Blacks destroy everything they touch, every place they inhabit in sufficient numbers.  There are no exceptions to this anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>  So high rates of imprisonment only encourage non offenders to commit similar crimes and imitate the incarcerated felons?  What sort of crazy circular logic is this?  It is the logic of today&rsquo;s liberalism, where no one is responsible for anything. It&rsquo;s Mr.Charlie&rsquo;s fault!</p>

		<p>Some liberals, especially very young ones, simply don&rsquo;t understand the situation the U.S. has with ghetto blacks.  Others, through the common knowledge that accrues with aging, do know but deny it.  Who could honestly believe that higher incarceration rates are not directly related to lower crime rates?  This liberal writer appears to be doing what liberals always do: state the facts and then employ magical thinking to deny a simple and obvious conclusion.  <br>
The sad facts are that, after the Civil War, many blacks in the South were running wild with their newfound freedom.  Many had no idea how they would obtain food or shelter, but the carpetbaggers and scalwags told them they were now in power and could even run the government.  After years of out-of-control crime, Southern whites regained control and instituted Jim Crow.  They didn&rsquo;t do it because they hate blacks or just wanted cheap, ready labor.  The situation was desperate, just as it has become years after the civil rights revolution.  Though low-IQ blacks are partially confined to plantation-like ghettos, they&rsquo;re now fully free to drive their cars into any neighborhood they please and commit crimes.  Modern carpetbaggers and scalwags assure them they &#8220;have their rights&#8221;, but many are too low mentally and testosterone-charged to keep their inclinations in check.  The people of the Old South knew this and acted accordingly.  Now, we&rsquo;re faced with walling ourselves up in castle-like dwellings in a new Dark Age.</p>

		<p><b>Flat Earthers at it, again.</b></p>
<p>Mathematical statistics offers scientifically-proven sophisticated tools for hypotheses testing. For instance, they were successfully used for decades to evaluate claimed benefits of new drugs.</p>
<p>Applying these to testing hypotheses about socio-ethnic relations in the American society would be a matter of simple routine to anyone who has access to data. Yet various Ivy League school researchers steer clear from this kind of fact finding. They resort to fallacious reasoning, similar to that used in &#8220;proofs&#8221; of perpetual motion machines, instead.</p>
<p>This fact alone is a clear indication that the &#8220;theories&#8221; like above belong to category of cow manure (or political propaganda, which is roughly the same thing).</p>
<p>The larger problem here is that the entire &#8220;diversity/affirmative action&#8221; push rests on denying statistical correlation between the genes and persons capabilities and behavior. This basically throws most of mathematical and statistical apparatus out when it comes to studying impact of race and ethnicity on such things like IQ, political orientation, criminality, etc. </p>
<p>So, it is not a big stretch to call the orthodox &#8220;Liberals&#8221; that deny said correlations (particularly those who resort to fallacies like those referred to in this article) <b>&#8220;flat Earthers&#8221;</b>.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all about gaining street cred&hellip;having done time in Massa&rsquo;s Big House. Street thugs think it helps their rep to have a sheet. Three hots and a cot and mingling with the baddest of the bad everyday is a prety good deal for them. All they give up is their freedom. None of these losers gets rehabilitated in the joint, they only get warehoused&hellip;</p>

		<p>Since the late 1960&rsquo;s I have read at least 300 sociologists&rsquo; explanations as to why our prisons are full of Blacks. None of those explanations have come anywhere near the truth. <br>
The truth is that until a few hundred years ago Blacks were tribal people who lived by the spear. It is a rare Black in sub-Saharan Africa that doesn&rsquo;t know the location of the old tribal boundaries. Tribal instincts are still strong in Blacks. Genocide in Africa happens every time Whites stop enforcing the peace.<br>
In America Blacks divide into gangs and violently enforce their boundaries. That&rsquo;s what their genetics prepared them to do. To deny that is to deny nature itself. <br>
Blacks are not genetically suited for life in Western society. That is a reality that can be neither ignored nor altered. They need their own country, free of White rules, surrounded by a well-guarded fence, where they can live the lives that nature designed for them.</p>

		<p>The easy tribal life in Africa, and then the welfare state effect of colonial slavery (as compared to Industrial Revolution white &#8220;employment&#8221; slavery of the North), Reconstruction programs like &#8220;40 Acres and a Mule,&#8221; land giveaways to black farmers, the resultant sharecropping system, topped off by the failed byoff that AA and related programs have created, have all combined to create a black national character that is permanently programmed to take from the system, whether that is an actual government or private system, or just a single white individual.  Ultimately, final and complete segregation is the answer.  To not do this will not only serve to eliminate whites from the population, it will cause the collapse of the government or governments wherever this happens.</p>

		<p>For violent street criminals a maximum security prison is a place to renew old friendships while learning new crime skills.  They should perform hard labor until they die or are too old to endanger decent people.  </p>

		<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s assume that not -every- black has inborn impulse control/low IQ deficits in behavior or social accomplishment thresholds.  Let&rsquo;s assume that these individuals can learn K-breeder control of their birth rates and so sustain a reasonable degree of generational consistency in handing down and ingraining individual discipline and good study/work/social habits.</p>
<p>The problem is, that what I read online says that, for blacks, the optimal society is one approaching 50:50 &#8216;diversity&rsquo; mix with whites or other races as a function of familiarity of culture, economic opportunity and community security issues.  </p>
<p>While for whites, the optimal is around 80-90% white and 10-20% other.  If any.  As a function of insular social comfort zoning and considered ability to share resources and empower individuals rather than groups in a white majority (meritocracy).</p>
<p>The problem then becomes-</p>
<p>A.  Determining what percentage of the black community can meet &#8216;white standards&rsquo; for low criminality and high social productivity in a fashion that is interoperably acceptable to both sides.</p>
<p>B.  Deciding how to arrange communities around which these (say) 40-50% of blacks overall can have -some- hope of using these innate skills to achieve the dream.  Since, if you throw them in amongst a non productive, high criminality, low social conformity, group.  Simply on a guilt by associative skin color basis.  Whatever decent traits (genetic or otherwise) they evince will vanish in the horde, effectively destroying ANY hope of blacks beginning the trek to a different level of culture.</p>
<p>I realize that a lot of us would be a lot more comfortable if Lincoln&rsquo;s plan could somehow still be enacted.  But whether it&rsquo;s an &#8216;Escape From New York&rsquo; scenario in our country.  Or a literal transport and dump effect in some other (note, modern day El Salvador refused the first time), you will not find many volunteers from the other side of the talking point.</p>
<p>Even if they know that our dim views on their overall prospects are valid and justified.</p>
<p>I actually found some sense in the poster who suggested a 10K/year &#8216;survival money&rsquo; payout for adults because that&rsquo;s dealing with a population containment issue that accepts a payoff in millions as being better than an uplift in billions for which so little Flynn type progress has actually been shown to occur.</p>
<p>They are American citizens folks.  Like it or lump it they have the 14th Amendments full protection, by design.  It would be better for us to get some basic, honest, answers as to how to fix a mutually livable system rather than hope that things get so bad that we build a fence like Israel (America is a continental superpower, our dominance is a function of landed resources!!).</p>
<p>Specifically-</p>
<p>1. How many blacks of the total extant population are smart enough to get in gear and stay there, with minimal generational recession to the mean on IQ?  Does -anyone- have these figures?</p>
<p>2. How many such successful blacks would whites accept as a percentage population -if- they were able to be a functional part of our society?</p>
<p>3. What would the remainder population and it&rsquo;s growth rate be under selective subsistence funding?</p>
<p>4. Would those (of whatever skin color) who cannot contribute or participate at full levels be willing to be isolated as minority members in trade for a subsidized lifestyle?</p>
<p>Keep in mind something here people.  We get the worst news out there because the MSM won&rsquo;t give an honest mix.  But it is still skewed for being the worst.</p>
<p>And these high incarceration rates, while they are (perhaps) encouraging pop control and lower criminality in the highest criminality segment of our society, also are costing us 30-40 grand a year in &#8216;razor wire hotel accommodations&rsquo;.  For black women who are without any possible mates in their own society, there must also be an incredible drive to miscegenate and that may not be good either for what it implies of a further lost-in-the-mix hybridizing of bad influences.</p>
<p>There has to be a more comprehensive answer than what we are seeing so single-sidedly represented by a couple of Harvard geeks here.  Genocide is not an option.  Deportation is not legal.  And isolative segregation only works if the total population base is small enough not to dominate the total cultural resources necessary to run American society as a whole.</p>

		<p>Cynicism? Lack of hope? Just the other day I was at the community college to drop off a request for records, and I overheard the following conversation while waiting in line. </p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t no felonies keep you from getting financial aid. I got two gun felonies, and one drug felony. I&rsquo;m getting aid. My brother goes here, and he has a pair of murders. You just need to talk to Miss Jones, and that selective service, drug felony s  &mdash;  - will go away as long as you haven&rsquo;t done anything lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you want to tell him that cause he wont hear it from me.&#8221; </p>
<p>No, their cynicism level is just fine; mine is starting to need some work though.  </p>

		<p>olewhitelady, you are correct. </p>
<p>The Confederacy was a conquered nation after the War of Northern Aggression ended, and the newly-freed slaves were running rampant, looting farms and raping white women at will. Organizations like the K sprang up because there was no one in position of power in the South to enforce any laws, and it proved very effective to scare the living daylights out of these criminals, and stretching their necks when the sight of ghosts on horseback weren&rsquo;t enough; besides, the victorious Northern interests thought Southerners should get their &#8216;just dues&rsquo;, if you will, and were not about to stand in the way of the carnage.</p>
<p>None other than Robert E Lee would say later in his life that had he known what reconstruction would have brought to the South, he never would have surrendered!</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1964, and the next reconstruction period brought on the South. Federal government has since thrown trillions of dollars at the race problem, and they still riot, they still account for violent crime far in excess of their population, and they still can&rsquo;t succeed in school. They have been forcefully removed from their old white masters on the plantation and allowed to become slaves to the current welfare state.</p>
<p>And the riots that will break out once Obama is voted out of office in 2012 will far surpass anything done before. Be prepared!</p>
