<h1>An Exercise in Style</h1>

	<p><b>Unique &#8220;Hair Fitness&#8221; competition at the Bronner Brothers International Hair Show on August 9 will recognize and reward exercise-compatible hairstyles</b></p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS &amp; ST. PAUL, Minn., Aug 09, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE)  &mdash;  Initiative designed to remove critical barrier to exercise</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Will recruit 60,000 African American stylists to the fight against obesity</p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare today launched an innovative collaboration with the Bronner Brothers International Hair Show to enroll 60,000 stylist attendees in the fight against obesity. Recognizing that data show many African American women avoid certain fitness activities in order to maintain their hairstyle, the initiative will feature the first-ever exercise-friendly hair competition, designed to remove hairstyle-related barriers to physical activity for women.</p>
<p>The initiative will kick-off with &#8220;Hair Fitness,&#8221; a contest of exercise-friendly hair styles, and remarks by Regina M. Benjamin, Surgeon General of the United States, at the Bronner Brothers International Hair Show on Monday, August 9, 2010, 2:00pm-4:00pm at the Georgia World Congress Center.</p>
<p>This initiative is inspired by the alarming rates of obesity in the African American population. According to the 2009 edition of America&rsquo;s Health Rankings, the prevalence of obesity among African Americans exceeds 30% in 35 states, which dramatically outpaces the corresponding obesity rates for Caucasians. In addition, studies show that many African American women avoid certain kinds of fitness activities in order to maintain a particular hairstyle, particularly given the time and cost involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to help African American women with innovative, easy ways they can keep their great style and keep fit,&#8221; said Reed Tuckson, M.D., executive vice president and chief of medical affairs at UnitedHealth Group. &#8220;We applaud the Bronner Brothers, who are an institution within the African American community, and the 60,000 stylists that attend their annual hair show for becoming key partners in the fight for the health of this community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the Surgeon General of the United States, my number one goal is to improve the health of the nation and I&rsquo;m proud to join with First Lady Michelle Obama to attack this problem head-on,&#8221; said Regina M. Benjamin, MD, MBA and the 18th Surgeon General of the United States. &#8220;I know first hand the important role salons play in our African American culture. I look forward to being an honorary judge of the Hair Fitness competition and to sharing the lessons we learn from this throughout the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a fitness instructor, ESPN commentator and President&rsquo;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports appointee, I am well aware of the importance of physical activity to overall health and the fight against obesity,&#8221; said Donna Richardson Joyner. &#8220;I look forward to participating in this unique event and plan to share the results with colleagues and women around the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bronner Brothers International Hair Show &#8220;Hair Fitness&#8221; competition will include three categories: low impact workout, which involves little to no sweat and hair maintenance would require only one shampoo/condition per week; moderate impact workout, which involves modest sweat and hair maintenance would require 1-2 shampoo/conditions per week; and high impact, which involves profuse sweating and would require 2-3 shampoo/conditions per week. The stylists will be judged on the technical execution of the styles, originality, suitability and head contour, and new ideas. The hair show will allow the audience to get ideas for clients who are looking to become more active and health conscious, while maintaining their hair regimen at the same time.</p>
<p>The National Black Women&rsquo;s Health and Beauty Conference and &#8220;Hair Fitness&#8221; competition at the Bronner Brothers International Hair Show is part of an on-going UnitedHealthcare campaign for health and fitness among the African American community. UnitedHealthcare has accumulated &#8220;Hair Fitness&#8221; styling tips from celebrity stylists around the country that will continue to educate African American about the importance of exercising while still being able to maintain their hair.</p>

		<p>The ability to become good athletes is one of the few things that blacks have going for them.  You would think that they would take advantage of this but apparently not.</p>

		<p>Yes, exercise and hair styles are racist.</p>
<p>As most intelligent White Men have realized, EVERYTHING is racist unless it results in free jobs, free money, free health care, or free housing for non-Whites.</p>
<p>I kid you not: In an elite graduate school, a professor argued that insurance rates were racist (the product of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;) because they were always higher for blacks.  Don&rsquo;t be too shocked when I say that this professor was black.  I raised my hand and explained that insurance is based upon actuarial forecasting, which means that empirical data drives the rates, not opinion or ideology.  I further explained that differing risk for disease, accidents, or the like are largely the product of choices and/or genetics, and that &#8220;racism&#8221; is a ridiculous and uninformed explanation.  The majority of the class looked at me as if I showed up in a pointy white hood.  </p>
<p>What a country!  The bottom-line lesson:</p>
<p>Disparate results are ALWAYS &#8220;racist&#8221; UNLESS it is non-Whites who are at an advantage (e.g. blacks in basketball, Asian engineers).  </p>
<p>Racism: the biggest hoax of the 20th century.  Let&rsquo;s leave behind in that century.</p>

<p>They propose that black women &#8220;profusely&#8221; sweat in regular exercise, but still only shampoo as little as twice per week?  YUCK!  Doesn&rsquo;t sound very pleasant for the co-workers of these Proud Black Women.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine the riding the subway in the summer if blacks actually do this.  </p>

<p>Huh?  On the days when I work out, those workouts almost always falling into the &#8220;high impact&#8221; category, if it&rsquo;s a day when I also go out in the evening, I&rsquo;ll have shampooed and conditioned my short and decidedly unsophisticated hair three times in that day, corresponding with my three showers.  Maybe those sorts of styles described in this article are such where cleaning is counter-productive; it might be one of those &#8220;black thangs&#8221; I just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

Blacks have an excuse for every one of their inherent faults.</p>
<p>Most blacks will never adopt healthy lifestyles. It doesn&rsquo;t matter on how much data or what overly priced initiatives are introduced.</p>
<p>Look at any marathon. While an African is likely to come in first, overwhelmingly the runners are white.</p>
<p>Whites run for their health, not necessarily too win. <br>

		<p>In my experience, black women resist exercise because it inhibits discourse.  &#8220;Lip fitness&#8221; is harder to maintain when one&rsquo;s respiration is labored.  </p>

		<p>African-Americans spend $9 billion p.a. on hair care.  Does AR honestly expect them to jeopardize this large investment with exercise?  Some uncharitable souls may suggest this money could be better used, ignoring the fact self-esteem is priceless.</p>

		<p>Shampooing more than every other day will re-curl a Black woman&rsquo;s hair much faster, plus straightening hair is time-consuming/expensive, so the majority who cant afford extensions/weaves or wigs rely on frequent salon touch-ups that others dont need, meaning that the less they wash their hair, the less money &amp; time they spend at the salon. Either way: GROSS!</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not black but I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s so great about exercising. In moderation, yes. But many whites, especially whites who strive for status, make a fetish of exercise. The fact is that exercising is 1) boring and 2) as likely to break down the body as build it up. </p>

The Surgeon General most certainly is a black woman. An OBESE black woman at that. I kid you not.</p>
