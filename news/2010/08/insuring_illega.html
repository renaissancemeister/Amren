<h1><a href="https://insurancenewsnet.com/article.aspx?id=219779&amp;type=newswires">Insuring Illegal Immigrants Develops Into Auto Niche</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Al Slavin, InsuranceNewsNet, August 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s far from the only service that Fiesta Auto Insurance Co. provides.</p>
<p>Yet John Rost, founder and president of the growing full service agency business, considers the particular practice to be in the best interest of drivers everywhere.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s referring to writing auto insurance policies for illegal immigrants, despite their inability to legally obtain a state-issued driver&rsquo;s license beforehand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The issue is framed within a larger ongoing political debate over immigration policy and can generate the same divisiveness. Rost pointed to the concern by some that issuing a driver&rsquo;s license to those without immigration status will result in other benefits following suit.</p>
<p>There is also the social welfare debate about using immigration status as a prerequisite for selling auto insurance, and whether such a limitation might skew one&rsquo;s chances of being hit by an uninsured motorist.</p>
<p>As history continues to show, a lack of insurance doesn&rsquo;t necessarily keep illegal drivers off the road. Bob Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, said about 15% of drivers in the United States lack automobile insurance. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;Unless the law of the state forbids an insurer from selling the coverage to someone who is undocumented, then it&rsquo;s likely there will be insurers and agents who are willing to service that market,&#8221; [said Hartwig].</p>
<p>In California, there is no state law that would prevent an insurer from selling an auto policy to a non-U.S. resident or an unlicensed driver, according to the state Department of Insurance. Carriers there can also write coverage for someone with a valid driver&rsquo;s license from another country. In 1993, the state passed a law that required licensed drivers to establish proof of legal residency, well in advance of momentum that has built at the federal level.</p>
<p>{snip} Spurred along by Congress in 2005 there has been a push for states to require that applicants have established a &#8220;lawful presence&#8221; in the United States before being issued a license.</p>
<p>As of March 2007, 30 states have adopted the lawful presence standard established under Real ID initiative, according to Janice Kephart, director of national security policy at the Center for Immigration Studies. All but four states  &mdash;  Illinois, New Mexico, Utah and Washington  &mdash;  require driver license applicants to establish a lawful presence.</p>
<p>Rost said assisting illegal immigrants in obtaining auto coverage is a small component of his franchise-oriented agency. Rost started his auto insurance business in California with four offices in 1999 and his initial target was the under-served Hispanic and Latino market (BestWire, Jan. 22, 2010).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rost noted that establishing citizenship isn&rsquo;t necessarily a requirement for purchasing or registering a car, something confirmed by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Insurers.</p>

		<p>One has to wonder how Fiesta pays off on claims.</p>
<p>But before anyone protests about foreigners buying cars and driving in foreign countries, remember that this goes on all the time, all over the world, and much commerce depends upon it.  I bought a car, isnured it and drove it with a AAA issured International Driver&rsquo;s License while I lived in Europe.  But I got stopped for routine checks in many the countries I traveled in, including France, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia.  This included border checks when passing between EU nations and non-Eu nations.  As an American, I was never subject to inspections for gun running (to Yugoslavia or even Albania), while everyone else was, when traveling south towards the Balkans.</p>

<p>In California, there is no state law that would prevent an insurer from selling an auto policy to a non-U.S. resident or an unlicensed driver, according to the state Department of Insurance. Carriers there can also write coverage for someone with a valid driver&rsquo;s license from another country.  &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well that being the case, we are brought to the issue of discrimination in insurance rate setting for buyers of auto insurance. Rate setting for the liability side of the auto policy has traditionally been based on driver experience, DMV records, annual mileage on vehicle, and records of at fault accidents. Comp and collision is based on those factors plus the garage zip code of the insured vehicle.</p>
<p>Therefore an alien (illegal or otherwise) with no license or an unvettable foreign license under a California auto insurance system could actually obtain better rates than a real Californian that has a bad, but vettable driving history.</p>

		<p>Assuming that the policies are legit it seems like a worthwhile service the guy&rsquo;s providing.  Who wants to get hit by an illegal with no insurance?  I normally never carry collision on my cars and wouldn&rsquo;t want to be left holding the bag for repairs if hit by an illegal.</p>

		<p>Come on people, you&rsquo;re not stupid.  From articles on this very site, a cop can pull an illegal over and KNOW he is illegal and if he _has not committed a crime_ do nothing about it.</p>
<p>But guess what, not having insurance is a crime and it SHOULD be a felony.  Which is _automatic deportation_.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, if they must have up to date insurance to be viable as driving workers, then Mexican&rsquo;s cannot flee immigration because insurance is the same as registering yourself to vote.</p>
<p>Finally, if you make these fine folks pay for insurance **at the level their ethnicity indicates as a perfectly legal bias for vehicular accident rates** (similar to older folk past a certain age) then you make it impossible for them to be economically viable here.</p>
<p>There is some room for argument in the &#8220;Jule Solis = squatters rights!&#8221;  &#8220;Only until I catch you on MY dirt!&#8221; debate.  But once you start making it easy for these folks on so many levels, to -be- citizens with whom you would not willingly breed and thus assimilate, you create a certain hypocrisy of self-victimization in pretending that this in fact IS still your land.</p>
<p>And not theirs&rsquo;.  Consider a TFR of 2.8 to 3.1, something which -dwarfs- both Asian, black and white fertility.  And then look at Mexico.  A nation flooded with people.  With no upward mobility because all of them are poor.  Living like wretches in frequent squalor.</p>
<p>These are not patriots looking for a new life.  They are people looking for a chance to make money off someone else&rsquo; success.  If they were anything else, they would reject our racial prejudices and limited access to higher jobs and fix the nation they already have.</p>
<p>Instead, they are fighting a war of infiltration and birth rate replacement.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartwig, I&rsquo;m sure you meant to say about 15% of the registered drivers in the U.S. lack insurance. Right? I mean, considering we have no clue how many illegals are in this country, how many of them are driving and assuming that at least 100% of those have no license, then we can also safely assume the 15% figure is, as is the total number of illegals here, absurdly underreported. I&rsquo;m sure  your statement was an oversight, correct?</p>
