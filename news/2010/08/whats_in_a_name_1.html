<h1>What&rsquo;s in a Name? An Entire Culture</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Khadijah McCaskill, Los Angeles Sentinel, August 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Africans were taken to America to become slaves, they were not only stripped of their clothes, they were also stripped of their names, taking their identities, and hopes and dreams. The slave master had deemed their meaningful African names too &#8220;exotic&#8221; and too hard to pronounce. In order to turn the slaves into mindless, chattel, upon which to build America&rsquo;s wealth, it was deemed necessary to rid the African people of a cultural identity. The slave masters usually gave slaves names from the bible such as, Luke, John, James, Joseph, Mary, Eve, and Ruth. Some were given short, percussive names such as Tom and Bill. During the time shortly before the Civil War, some masters named their slaves after the American forefathers such as Washington and Jefferson.</p>
<p>After the Civil War, many slaves decided to reinvent their identity by making their names more unique. Common names such as Lucy were embellished to Lucinda. Some common Western names such as John and Mary began to fall out of favor with White people as more and more Black people began using them. {snip}</p>
<p>During the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement was gaining momentum. Black people were eager to have equal rights in America, as well as discover their African roots, and create a unique Black culture. This manifested itself in the naming of Black children, and the re-naming of people involved in the Civil Rights movement. Many Black people had Arabic names as the Nation of Islam rose to power within the Black community. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} A mixture of Swahili-sounding names and pleasing percussive sounds gave birth to names like Lakesha, Swantezza, Johntae, Rashawn, and Shaquan. Dreams of prosperity and better lives for their children inspired parents to name their children after luxury items such as Lexus, Prada, Chanel, and Treasure. Qualities and nouns that parents felt described their children gave rise to names like Heaven, Omunique (pronounced I&rsquo;m unique), and Precious.</p>
<p>Blacks have been under fire for years for these &#8220;ghetto&#8221; names. {snip} Even Black people have begun to criticize those who give their children these creative names, saying that Black children should have more &#8220;normal&#8221; names. But why? Why should Black people&rsquo;s names be changed? Too often Whites and others attach Black stereotypes to these creative names. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In 2003, Marianne Bertrand, an associate professor at the University of Chicago graduate school of Business, and Sendhi Mullainathan of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, designed a study called &#8220;Are Emily and Brendan More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?&#8221; The study was designed to see if there was any discrimination towards people with Black sounding in the screening of applications for different jobs. The team sent out over 5,000 applications answering want-ads in the Boston Globe and The Chicago Tribune. They gave each of the fake applicants either very White sounding names like Emily Walsh or Brendan Baker, or very Black sounding names like Jamal Jones or Lakisha Washington. The study showed that those with White-sounding names were 50 percent more likely to get a call for an interview for the job. It didn&rsquo;t even matter if the applicants with Black sounding names had more credentials, or were better qualified for the job. The field in which the applicants were trying to get a job didn&rsquo;t matter much either, the discrimination was the same across the board. Even jobs that posited that they were &#8220;Equal Opportunity&#8221; discriminated at pretty much the same rate.</p>
<p>The lesson from this study and the history of Black names is that names represent an identity that was created after everything was taken from African people. {snip} Anyone who thinks these names are stupid or outrageous doesn&rsquo;t understand that they are being duped into thinking that originality is a bad thing, who made them the all-important deciders of which names are &#8220;normal&#8221; and which names are not? It is absolutely illogical to try and infer what a person can or can&rsquo;t do, or how much they do or don&rsquo;t have, just by their names alone.<br>

		<p>There is a theory that the origin of these colorful first names that black parents give their black children originates before the WBTS   &mdash;   Because family breakup as part of the slave system was a fact of life, so goes the theory, black parents gave their newborn children outlandish names as sort of deuterium in the water, i.e. no other black person had the name, so when the child got older and was eventually sold off, gossip that got around from plantation to plantation involving the slave with that name could only be that particular person.</p>
<p>The flaw in that theory is that, as this article rightly points out, these unique names were a post-Civil Rights era thing, more than a century later.</p>

		<p>Black names are great. My local newspaper publishes a police blotter page which doesn&rsquo;t identify race but the names of the perps are all you need. Daquan/JaMarcus/Latrina Let&rsquo;s hear it for Latrina! And, employees, you must wash your hands before returning to work!</p>

		<p>Putting the &#8220;white man stole our culture&#8221; nonsense aside, I see a small point here. </p>
<p>Names like Treasure and Luxus are just ridiculous, but I am not really against Blacks naming their children Lakeisha or Jamal. Everyone has a right to their culture. But it comes to this: getting uppity when someone makes fun of these names is just stupid. </p>
<p>Just as the Natives were once considered a separate nation and not eligible for US citizenship, so we should see a rethinking on black citizenship. I do not mean ousting them out of the country, but demanding that the three nations of this country live apart.  </p>

One of the dumbest statements Ive ever heard.  So names like Latrine or lemongello or the myriad of other absurd names are supposed to resemble creativity?  Yet more pandering to the race of failures and their social norms.</p>

		<p>I have heard it said the made-up name thing is not due to some innate creativity but to immaturity. Specifically, the very young birth age of many black women is to blame: children naming children. The so-called exotic quality of &#8220;ghetto&#8221; names doesn&rsquo;t ring true at all. Many of these names are a source of rich amusement for those who don&rsquo;t have to bear them. Personally, I find it in very bad taste to make fun of another person&rsquo;s name but this tradition is asking for it.</p>

<p>And why should whites hire people with such bizarre and non-conformist names? Works both ways, Khadijah my friend. Notice the bait-and-switch here: it&rsquo;s all about freedom when it comes to naming children, but suddenly freedom ends when it comes to choosing employees.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Anyone who thinks these names are stupid or outrageous doesn&rsquo;t understand that they are being duped into thinking that originality is a bad thing, who made them the all-important deciders of which names are &lsquo;normal&rsquo; and which names are not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, the sad thing is that these days, blacks are not the only ones dishing out these odd names to their children; there are more than enough whites who do it too. For example, I actually had a white coworker admit to me that she had considered naming her newborn daughter Malia, because she thought it was &ldquo;pretty.&rdquo; Mind you, this was not a case of Obama worship, since she hated the &ldquo;savior&rdquo; and voted for McCain; it was a purely &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; issue that was decided when her husband stated it was not going to happen, as the name sounded &ldquo;too ethnic&rdquo; and did not go well with their last name. </p>
<p>Also, remember this is not a new phenomenon. The 60s saw a number of counter cultural white fools bestow upon their children ridiculous names like &ldquo;Sunshine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Moonbeam.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is a sad state of affairs, since it often leaves the poor child open to ridicule that shouldn&rsquo;t be their lot. It is the folly of their parents, not their own. Thus I do agree with this &ldquo;author&rsquo;s&rdquo; last sentence to a point: &ldquo;It is absolutely illogical to try and infer what a person can or can&rsquo;t do, or how much they do or don&rsquo;t have, just by their names alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>One has to stretch a very noble word beyond its breaking point to describe the interaction of African-Americans as a &#8220;culture.&#8221; <br>
The names that these black mothers (I&rsquo;m sure the fathers are absent) give their children will be stigmas for life. These names will always scream out: &#8220;I am ghetto, I am from ghetto stock, and I will always be ghetto.&#8221;<br>
For an example of these names, google the recent story of the six black teenagers in Shreveport who drowned because none could swim: all ghetto names.<br>
My personal favorite of the six is &#8220;JaTavious.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Names can certainly indicate culture or class, e.g. Latrine, Latrina, Quantavius, Shaniqua, Orangelo, D&rsquo;Brickashaw, Anfernee (sic), and my personal favorite: Le-a (&#8220;Iz pronounced La-dash-ah, cuz the dash don&rsquo;t be silent!&#8221;).  </p>
<p>&#8220;[I]dentity that was created after everything was taken from African people.&#8221;    &mdash;  -&gt;Fact: Africans in American, if aggregated as a separate nation, are some of the richest people ON EARTH.  As others have said, Africans in America should be thankful that they ended up in a White, North American nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absolutely illogical to try and infer what a person can or can&rsquo;t do, or how much they do or don&rsquo;t have, just by their names alone.&#8221;    &mdash;  -&gt;This is African/egalitarian logic at its best.  It&rsquo;s actually true, and quite logical, that ghetto names correlate with criminality and low intelligence.  See Freakonomics, or just use your common sense!</p>

		<p>History over the past 50 years or so has shown that potential employers quickly learned what a burden someone with a name like Jamal or Lakesha can be, with their ghetto attitude and looking-for-easy-money lawsuit mentality, so it is no surprise these potential employers would avoid such names.  I don&rsquo;t blame them.  I would do the same thing were I in such a position.  </p>
<p>One benefit with the outlandish names is, when the main stream media report crime, and do not reveal the race of the perp, which they are much inclined to do, it is much easier to ascertain the race of that perp.</p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve hired a few blacks with colorful (pun intended) names, you develop a sixth-sense and a lesson learned. Why repeat mistakes?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if the white and black candidates have the same qualification. I know from experience that I&rsquo;m likely to have a better worker by the name of Michael than one named Mychel. Black names carry a lot of baggage and anyone who hires or works with blacks knows the name is a red flag. When you&rsquo;ve hired and then fired a Mychel, you&rsquo;re weary about hiring a DeShawn. </p>
<p>As for the premise of this piece; more Afro-mumbo-jumbo, convoluted justification, rationalization of foolishness.</p>
<p><i>Too often Whites and others attach Black stereotypes to these creative names.</i></p>
<p>Yes, and for good reason. Blacks with stereotype names are likely to be stereotypes.<br>

<p>Of course, if someone thinks his/her name is a social or career liability, getting it legally changed is easy to do. So I must respectfully disagree with John&rsquo;s last point.</p>

		<p>I personally approve entirely of ridiuclous black &#8220;ghetto&#8221; names.<br>
First, they instantly separate and identify blacks. Second, they fully reveal the childish, silly and intellectually backward nature of blacks on the whole. </p>
<p>Contrary to this author&rsquo;s assertion that these goofy names are some great expression of creativity, many of the names are nothing more than obvious bastardizations of whites names and named things - ie. Lashawn, Deshawn, Johntae, Precious, Ebony etc. What is creative about that? <br>

		<p>No, I think these names are an attempt by black people to be like white people like blond weaves are and to be flashy.  The ghetto names like the blond weaves and blue contacts come off as phony, desparate and convoluted.  Pretty much all these ghetto names are based on Caucasian names and word formation whether French, English, Italian, Irish or Arabic.  Black people are not looking to create names that are within African naming conventions.  When people hear a name like Treasure Jackson they think of a busted black woman living on welfare with 10 kids from nine different men.  This is why I rather have non-white people stick to their foreign names instead of changing them to white ones because it brings associations to these names that make white people want to avoid them.</p>

		<p>Every Shaquan I&rsquo;ve met, and I&rsquo;ve met many in the &#8220;public&#8221; schools, otherwise known as segregated minority schools, is a moron.  That&rsquo;s why employers turn these unpronouncable named losers down. Judgement is part of who you are and so is the family you come from. </p>
<p>Blacks with stupid names come from households that either despise or are ignorant of higher level learning or what it takes to be a professional. Blacks with normal names aren&rsquo;t always so quick either, but some of them are among the small segment of blacks capable of professional level performance and communication skills. BTW, more and more Hispanics name their kids with Anglo names like James and Brenda.  I know all the problems illegals have caused, but when these Hispanics are here for  a generation or two and don&rsquo;t use Aztec names, I applaud them.<br>
I am not for racial discrimination. I am for moron discrimination which eliminates many whites, some Jews, some Asians, most Hispanics and most blacks from any meaningful role in deciding how major decisions affecting communities or business should be made. </p>
<p> All men, women, people, are not created equal and we should thank idiot black mothers for making our task easier to weed out the retarded from the potentially talented.</p>

		<p>While I will admit that Blacks tend to go off the deep end when it comes to naming their children, the fact is tht some of us Whites have been known to flip out as well. names like Apple, Trig, Bronx, Cloud, River (River Phoenix)Muffin etc&hellip; are as loony as some of the names Black give thier children.  </p>

		<p>True, the name Khadijah has been around a lot longer than a lot of &#8220;normal&#8221; names. However, it is an Arabic name. I would expect to see that name quite often if I lived in the middle east just as I would expect to see the name Guiseppe if I lived in Italy.</p>
<p>I look at some of the names that white children are tagged with now and these are not similar names to my classmates from the 12 years I spent in the State Pen (aka &#8220;Public Schools&#8221;). While the parents of these white children haven&rsquo;t gone as far as D&rsquo;Antavious or LaQuisha, I believe that they are setting the kids up for problems down the line. Rodney, LeRoy, and Tyrone were about the worst of the bunch that I remember in school and I have seen whites with these names (except for Tyrone). </p>
<p>How many black actors over the age of 40 have utterly ridiculous names? James Earl Jones or Morgan Freeman are pretty normal. I will agree that giving black kids these monikers makes life a lot easier for employers who wish to weed out potential lawsuits. If your applicants have names like Walter, Samuel, Thomas, or Stanley, it is generally a lot harder to judge race on account of the first name.  </p>

		<p>The only interesting twist in the black naming thang is the Russian sounding name jive. In this name jive we see the history of African liberation movements, cynically and generously supported by our friends the Soviets. Although of course the liberation movements eventually rolled over dead, the tradition wouldn&rsquo;t. Maybe Africans and the displaced in America were grateful for their moment in the sun. Certainly they knew those smokin&rsquo; 47&rsquo;s just didn&rsquo;t appear by magic. Or did they?<br>
Well, anyway, if you have run across a &#8220;Tanya&#8221; or &#8220;Nikita&#8221; in the office point it out (also point out that Nikita is a man&rsquo;s name).<br>
I predict Africans will get grateful for the really close hug they are going to get from our new friends the Chinese. Might there be some young people named &#8220;Changara&#8221; or  &#8220;Shantana&#8221; soon?</p>

		<p>&#8220;When Africans were taken to America to become slaves, they were not only stripped of their clothes, they were also stripped of their names, taking their identities, and hopes and dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopes and dreams? Is this &#8216;writer&rsquo; serious?<br>

<p>So are lions and hyenas.</p>
<p>This screed is nothing other than another pounding of the war drum, and chanting the Let&rsquo;s hate Whitey anthem:  &#8220;Whitey be evil!  Whitey took EVERYTHING from US!!&#8221; </p>
<p> This is the lame excuse for all the &#8220;Let&rsquo;s Get Whitey!&#8221; that comes so naturally to them, and the idea that all you can take from him (and her) is nothing more than recovering stolen property, and any harm you do to any whites is justified retribution.   Why, it be justice itself!   </p>
<p>Of course, the truth is that parasites need no encouragement to act according to their nature.  Perhaps words like these serve the same function as certain kinds howling does for a pack of wolves on the prowl. </p>

		<p>Blacks naming their children with names live Lateesha, La Tonya, LaTavious, etc. has nothing to do with creativity.  It is the result of Blacks wanting to establish some sort of sophistication for themselves.  They think that if their names sound exotic or sophisticated, then it follows that they are sophisticated.  I also have seen more than one Black girl with the name &#8216;Natasha&rsquo;, which is Russian in derivation.  And this has not gone on since the Civil War.  This is an entirely new phenomenon.  Those of you who are old enough to remember the 60&rsquo;s through the 80&rsquo;s knows full well that there were very few Blacks with names unlike Whites then.  As time went by this phenomenon proceeded further and further.  And it will continue to do so.  There is one advantage, and that is that it DOES make it easier for prospective employers to choose the White over the Black, at least when they&rsquo;re viewing a resume.  It will assist just a little in compensating for the wrongs perpetrated by things like affirmative action and quotas for Blacks.<br>

		<p>Common sense dictates you do not name your child something that a clown would reject as being too idiotic. </p>
<p>It shows the limited level of parenting skill - almost an oxymoron as applied to blacks.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking about the child the mother comes up with a ridiculous name because it makes her feel cool. Almost like bling. It&rsquo;s generally accepted that ghetto names result in less opportunity later in life so you&rsquo;d think they might choose a more standard American name but no, the neologisms continue.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with African heritage since most blacks have no understanding of their history. In fact, the African studies departments in universities were all set up by whites in the first place. Nor does it have to do with some bogus re-interpretation of slavery.</p>
<p>People should call it simply for what it is - stupidity. At least it provides employers with an extra opportunity to weed out potential problem hires. Names like DeShaun and Lashonda spell trouble.</p>

		<p>#12 - I don&rsquo;t believe it for a second either. Those &#8220;researchers&#8221; will create phony resumes where Jill White has a master&rsquo;s degree from Yale, and Shaniqua Jackson has a degree from Porky Pig&rsquo;s Online Diploma Mill. When Jill White gets an interview and Shaniqua Jackson does not, they&rsquo;ll scream discrimination, even though the hiring manager&rsquo;s decision was made based on qualifications and not on names. Of course the &#8220;researchers&#8221; *say* they gave the phony applicants equal qualifications, but all we have for that is their word, and we know how much a liberal multicult&rsquo;s word is worth (nothing).</p>
<p>Same thing when they try to &#8220;prove&#8221; housing &#8220;discrimination&#8221; - they&rsquo;ll send out a black couple looking to rent an apartment, and create a phony record for them where the male has a rap sheet as long as a bread line after enough Obamanomics, and the female has 7 illegitimate children from 5 different fathers, and owes $10,000 in unpaid taxes. After they naturally get rejected - for their terrible (phony) background, not for the color of their skin, the &#8220;researchers&#8221; will scream prejudice and file a lawsuit against the landlord. </p>

		<p>Excuse me, but I&rsquo;m having trouble imagining how the &#8216;Slave Masters&rsquo; were able to &#8216;strip&rsquo; the Africans of their names.  I mean, I hardly think it likely that the slaves had name tags around their necks&hellip;.attached, maybe, by the OTHER AFRICANS WHO ORIGINALLY TOOK THEM AS SLAVES, to be traded to the Arabs.  </p>
<p>And I doubt that the Arabs affixed name tags to them, since I can&rsquo;t see the Arabs patiently asking the slaves their names, and then struggling to phonetically spell names from places where there were no written languages.<br>
 <br>
Would the names be told on-board ship?</p>
<p>Then, once bought, I can&rsquo;t imagine the Africans&rsquo; understanding  &#8220;What is your name?&#8221;, or the American &#8216;Slave Masters&rsquo; realizing that the alien clicks and grunts coming from the slaves were words&hellip;much less names.</p>

<p>The thing is, Luther, that no one is going to put the name &#8220;Billy Bob&#8221; on a job application. (Except for Billy Bob Thornton, of course.) If Mr. Thornton had not established his persona and reputation as an actor, if he had chosen a different career, his friends would call him Billy Bob.

		<p>To Nick at #45:</p>
<p>You are bang on. When blacks give themselves and their children such ridiculous names, they are actually making a statement - we reject the broader white culture and its values, which of course, includes peoples names. You could contrast this with Japanese-Americans. How many of them have bizarre first names or even Japanese ones? Almost any Japanese-American I can think of has an Anglicized name. Of course, the Japanese community is light years ahead of blacks in economic success and social stability. That&rsquo;s fine with me though. Blacks can call themselves whatever they want to. It makes it simple to identify criminals in our politically correct MSM that doesn&rsquo;t mention race. It also helps out on job hiring too. I feel bad about one name though. Tyrone was originally an Irish name. There is a county in Ireland called that. It has been pretty much &#8216;claimed&rsquo; by blacks now though.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Common names such as Lucy were embellished to Lucinda. Some common Western names such as John and Mary began to fall out of favor with White people as more and more Black people began using them. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>This sentence might be the most ridiculous in this entire ridiculous article.  How many John&rsquo;s and Mary&rsquo;s has any reading this known - dozens, hundreds?  As for &#8220;Lucy,&#8221; I believe the author has it backwards.  And I don&rsquo;t know for certain about Lucinda, but Lucille was a French name originally.  (BB King named his guitar &#8220;Lucille&#8221;).  I think it is because of the blacks overwhelming New Orleans that blacks have an attraction to French sounding names because they connote to them a higher culture.  </p>
<p>AND YES,  Blue Blood is right!!!  Blacks took and take names in order to seem more important and classy.  &#8220;George Washington Carver&#8221; - anyone?  It is well known that many slaves took names of famous people, their owners surnames, even good sounding names off of product labels after Emancipation.  Today, the way blacks immitate white hair and exaggerate white wealth culture is like watching a ridiculous cartoon.  Even the Obama&rsquo;s in the White House seem like a parody approaching &#8220;The Jefferson&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ridiculing or disrespecting (we used to call it simply &#8216;making fun of&rsquo;) people&rsquo;s appearances, names, or anything else that belonged to them is a product of human nature. I remember getting a giggle out of classmates named &#8220;Delbert&#8221; (&#8216;egghead&rsquo; or &#8216;dork&rsquo;), &#8220;Dickie&#8221; (for obvious reasons), &#8220;Clara&#8221; (old fashioned), and felt sorry about the handle their parents hung on them. When I lived in Ohio in the early 60&rsquo;s there was a fruit loop couple with the last name of Hogg, (yes, this is a fact) who was the talk of the Air Base, who named his two daughters Ima and Yura. What chance did they have of growing up normal? Plus, it gave you an insight as to what MAY be the type of environment they lived in; the influences that MAY have had an effect on their character. People, whites included, have no idea what power a name can have.</p>
<p>Didactic #25, very true. I know a very well-to-do-black family, all extremely bright AND educated, the father a retired bank executive who started up the most successful hot wings restaurant in our area. Some of the nicest, fairest, and &#8216;full of commmon sense&rsquo; people I know. His name was Harold, his son was named Rodney and daughter Tanya. Harold knew that hanging some pretext of an African name would do nothing but hinder his children&rsquo;s future.

I do remember a Toriano and a couple of Kuntas later but these were rare. Funny that &#8220;Khadija&#8221; was mentioned as a black name- the only Khadija I have ever known was an auburn haired, fair skinned, green eyed daughter of a white Lebanese father and white American mother. </p>

		<p>Names are  just  made-up  words  that  humans  attach  to  things  or persons.  In this  regard, I  someetimes  wonder what  Europeans  called  each  other  before  the  coming  of  Christianity.</p>
<p>But  here&rsquo;s  some  hints  but  I am  sure  most  readers  will  not  be  amused.  Peter  from  petrum(rock  in Latin). And  I sure there&rsquo;s  a  Mr. Rock  somewhere.  And  the  following: Stone, Fish, Bird, Rivers, Arrow, Marksman,  Flint, etc.  And what  about  those silly, long-winded French and  Spanish  names?</p>
<p>OK  some  blacks  embellished  original  English or  French  names.  Well,  petrum(rock) was  embellished  to  become Pierre, Peter, Pedro, etc.  And the same for  all  those  names  copied from the  Christian  Bible  and  and the  Jewish  Torah.</p>

		<p>Like it or not, names mean something. They give off connotations, they give impressions, they have an appearance. There&rsquo;s no way around it.</p>
<p>Weird black names give an impression. Foreign sounding names give an impression. Some will make the typical American think that a job applicant is from Russia, others will make the typical American think that a job applicant is from China. Some names will give the impression that a person is a typical American white person of English or German descent, when in fact they might not be anything of the sort.</p>
<p>As another commenter already pointed out - some &#8220;white names&#8221; can also be discriminated against. Some white names fairly or unfairly connote a lower socioeconomic background or a lower education level.</p>
<p>And as the demographics of this country change, who is to say that having a very typical sounding &#8220;white name&#8221; is going to be any sort of advantage? When businesses are filling positions with &#8220;workplace diversity&#8221; in mind, having a white name is no help.</p>
<p>So, in short, some black people think they&rsquo;re being discriminated against because of their names? Tough. So are plenty of other people.</p>
<p>Finally, my last point is: I&rsquo;ve never gotten a good job by answering an ad in the paper or submitting a resume. I&rsquo;ve always gotten them by having a good reputation and being referred positively through an informal network of people who know each other for a variety of reasons. This &#8220;network&#8221; generally recognizes ability, no matter what a person&rsquo;s class, race or ethnic background. Names (and race too) make no difference in this context.  </p>

		<p>This is what happens when you let the women name the children.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just blacks. For every Oranjello or DeShaunte, there is an Aiden/Braiden/Jaiden. For every Lakeisha, there is a (fill in the name of the current soap opera hottie). When my kids were in grade school, the girls all seemed to be named Nicole (because she was a soap opera character).</p>
<p>That said, this story always comes around once or twice a year, so let me be the first to say it: Unique black names tell us who to hire, and who is likely to sue for an invented &#8220;civil rights&#8221; violation. So this trend should be encouraged.</p>
<p>And as for &#8220;Even jobs that posited that they were &#8216;Equal Opportunity&rsquo; discriminated at pretty much the same rate,&#8221; well what did you expect? They&rsquo;re &#8220;equal.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think the person who commented that blacks often have their children at young ages has a valid point.  The names I thought were fantastic in high school, I recognized as embarrassingly trailer-trashy by the time I actually had my first baby at age 25.  </p>
<p>Both of my children turned out to be girls, but when considering boys&rsquo; names, my husband vetoed a lot of my choices, and in hindsight, I realize that he was right, even though we are now divorced.  Having two parents hashing out a baby-name decision probably eliminates most of the extreme names, which is why the upper classes still use classic names like Susan and Stephen, while the single moms are more likely to choose trendy names like Aiden, Caden, Jaden, Braden, etc.  </p>

		<p>It is a fact that most blacks have their given name for &#8220;official records&#8221; like driver&rsquo;s licenses but actually are more commonly known by their street names&hellip;. it makes it rather difficult for police or debt collectors to track them down when you are looking for Jamal Jones but he is only known as Jitterbug in the &#8216;hood. So the names are much less important. <br>
I imagine it is made worse by the Baby-Daddy syndrome since European names reflect a line of parentage and upbringing whereas the ethnic names are the result of some momentary encounter&hellip;.no known parentage or pride thereof. It&rsquo;s a symptom of social upheaval and devaluation of marriage, family, and education. <br>

		<p>To me these names do not reflect a &#8220;culture,&#8221; but rather the end result of widespread teenage pregnancy.  If you&rsquo;re a low-class girl with no prospects then typically your only &#8220;accomplishment&#8221; will be having a baby.  These girls have no education and no marriage or career prospects.  They likewise have no interests or hobbies.  Thus, they give their baby a ridiculous name because naming their baby is their only moment to &#8220;shine.&#8221;  A baby is the first time they have &#8220;created&#8221; or &#8220;accomplished&#8221; something.  To me it seems almost like a contest between these girls as to who can give their baby the most creative name.  </p>
<p>Giving a baby a name like William or Jane would be admitting that having a baby is actually a totally banal, common thing that anyone can do.  If these girls did that, they would be facing the truth about their predicament - they have not accomplished anything that anyone else could not do.  </p>
<p>The reasons these names are &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against is because they truly say a lot about the person.  The truth is that very few people &#8220;escape&#8221; their roots.  Maybe there is a DeShawn out there working on his dissertation for MIT as we speak, but that is generally not the case.  </p>
<p>Employers do not care in the least what your race is.  Your skin tone is irrelevant.  What is relevant, however, is your ability to show up on time, not call in &#8220;sick,&#8221; do as your told, not bring drama to work, and not to sue later because of &#8220;discrimination.&#8221;  To the thinking person, ghetto names just imply that the person will behave in this fashion.  It&rsquo;s not a hatred of blacks.  </p>

		<p>#59- Even though I am female I totally agree with you! In 20 years colleges will be full of Aiden-Jayden-Colins and some other silly name will be in vogue for babies. If you read the book &#8220;Freakenomics&#8221; there is a chapter about names and their reasoning is that if someone has a &#8220;black&#8221; name then the ghetto attitude will go with it. Ditto for the &#8220;trailer trash&#8221; names they gave (Amber and Crystal were two). I have a very common but now old fashioned first name and when my classrooms in the late 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s were full of Jennifers, Michelles and Amys I felt somewhat left out. I now am glad of the decision to name me after my aunt. I am also glad that we chose a classic name for our daughter who is now almost three- none of the Madison Addison or Alexis garbage for us. </p>

<p>Your post is ridiculous. Just like black names that make no sense and just seem to be randomly made up out of thin air. You wonder what European names were before the coming of Christianity? Just read the history of ancient Rome or Greece. Europe only became Christian in the fourth century. And even then only those parts that were under Roman authority. You think Europeans didn&rsquo;t have a history or exist before the fourth century?</p>

		<p>This whole thing arises from a test in which the non-white researchers manufactured paper identities and then applied different names to them.  </p>
<p>The built-in assumption, of course, is that there is no correlation between names and behavior there is only a correlation between names and racial prejudice.  </p>
<p>This is foolish, of course, because we know that name judging is done by everybody.  Do you think a white applicant named &#8220;Robert E. Lee&#8221; would get the same treatment as a black applicant named &#8220;John Smith&#8221; by a black businessman? Would Jewish business owners treat an &#8220;Adolf Hitler&#8221; or &#8220;Hermann Goering&#8221; resume equally with a &#8220;Abraham Finkelbaum&#8221; resume?</p>
<p>What the researchers did not do (and would never, EVER do) was verify that there wan no rational reason to discriminate in favor of John and against Shaquan&#8221;. How would you do this?  Go through criminal records and see if there is a correlation between a goofy name and criminal activity.  is there a higher percentage of &#8220;Shaquan&#8221; and &#8220;Roshawn&#8221; in prison or on welfare, or fired for laziness or theft than &#8220;John&#8221; or &#8220;Mary&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If stupid name ARE correlated with bad behavior (and we all know they are), then it is perfectly rational for any employer, black or white, to discriminate on the basis of names.  I would much rather have a ghetto employee that came from a family with a mother and father who are still married, church attending, with a name like &#8220;William&#8221;, or &#8220;Henry&#8221;, or &#8220;Michael&#8221; or &#8220;Steven&#8221;.  We all would.</p>
<p>Black businessmen show the same bias against ghetto names that white businessmen do, and for the same reason: ghetto names indicate trouble down the road.</p>
<p>All the college professors&rsquo; test measures is whether the people taking it were smart enough to know that, on average, ghetto names = ghetto trouble.</p>

		<p>If i remember correctly, Gracie Slick had a baby girl she named &#8220;god&#8221;. She said she named it with a small &#8220;g&#8221; because she had to &#8220;be humble&#8221; about this.</p>
<p>To Shawn  (the female) re post # 51:</p>
<p>A former co-worker of mine was telling us of a (white) couple she knew, named Cox. They had a baby girl, whom they named Fonda (don&rsquo;t know if this couple were fans of Henry, Jane or Peter). So their daughter was &#8220;Fonda Cox.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parents of all races should think things through when naming a baby. Just because it may sound &#8220;cool&#8221; or &#8220;exotic&#8221; means nothing, because it&rsquo;s their offspring who will carry the moniker.</p>
<p>I remember in the 1980&rsquo;s Notre Dame&rsquo;s football team had the Francisco brothers, Hiawatha and D&rsquo;Juan. Neither made it into the pros.</p>

		<p>Sarge on Aug. 20th - As a side note, any white person who has been around a funny-named black knows NEVER to mispronounce it. Great care must be taken, and the slightest syllabic misstep (or even faltering) is likely to result in outrage, anger, and accusations of racism.</p>
<p>I personally take &#8220;great care&#8221; to INTENTIONALLY misprononce thoses stupid names, while at the same shaking my head and having a &#8216;just bit into a lemon&rsquo; look on my face. You&rsquo;re right that it does anger them, that&rsquo;s WHY I do it intentionally!   </p>

<p>I have Italian older female cousins named Malia. A search revealed various origins of the name. One said that it is a corruption of Maria, another of Amelia. Yet another claimed it was Polynesian. I believe it to be the former, rather than Polynesian. Not that Polynesians didn&rsquo;t have a name that sounded like it, or similar, but I am 100% certain that my Italian family didn&rsquo;t name themselves after Polynesian names. <br>
I think it is a pretty name, too. I also think Juliana, Angelo and Sandela are equally attractive names. They may sound out-of-place in Anglo America, but they are not made-up, or of recent origin.</p>
