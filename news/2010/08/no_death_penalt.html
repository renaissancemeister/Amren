<h1>No Death Penalty in Police Slayings</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cleve R. Wootson Jr., Charlotte Observer (North Carolina), August 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Mecklenburg judge ruled Tuesday that Demeatrius Montgomery should not face the death penalty because a detective&rsquo;s misconduct has tainted the trial in the killings of two Charlotte police officers.</p>
<p>But Superior Court Judge Forrest Bridges allowed the trial to continue, rejecting a request by Montgomery&rsquo;s attorneys to dismiss the murder charges entirely.</p>
<p>Bridges called the case a &#8220;moving target.&#8221; He said former police Detective Arvin Fant&rsquo;s admission that he threw away and plagiarized notes has &#8220;placed a cloud of suspicion over these proceedings.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Montgomery is charged in the 2007 killings of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police officers Jeff Shelton and Sean Clark.</p>
<p>As Montgomery left the courtroom Tuesday, in an orange jail uniform and shackles, he looked at his family and smiled  &mdash;  his first flash of emotion in two days of court proceedings. His grandmother wiped tears from her eyes after the judge ruled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fant, a former military police officer who has been with CMPD for 12 years, has been placed on administrative leave and the department is investigating. He lost his detective title on Saturday. He could lose his job and face criminal charges, Police Chief Rodney Monroe said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Monroe said he doesn&rsquo;t believe Fant was attempting to manufacture evidence but simply did sloppy police work. Fant was assigned to the case hours after Shelton and Clark were shot at an east Charlotte apartment complex.</p>
<p>In testimony Monday, Fant admitted he threw away some investigative notes and rewrote other inadequate notes by using his colleagues&rsquo; documentation of the case. He said he copied and pasted another officer&rsquo;s notes into documents he later submitted as his own.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Fant added another surprise. Minutes before trial, he phoned his supervisors and suggested they retrieve a box of files near his desk. He hasn&rsquo;t been allowed in the office. But the files, he explained, might contain some of his original case notes.</p>
<p>Detectives brought the box to court soon after Tuesday&rsquo;s proceedings began and said it contained little about the case, other than a mention of sympathy cards sent to the Shelton family.</p>
<p>Montgomery&rsquo;s lawyers argue that Fant&rsquo;s revelation Tuesday indicates such disorganization and disregard for evidence rules that the whole investigation is tainted.</p>
<p>They say Fant&rsquo;s actions violate N.C. laws that require sharing of evidence before a trial. They say Fant&rsquo;s handling of evidence also became an issue in a 2003 robbery conviction that was appealed, but upheld.</p>
<p>Fant&rsquo;s missing notes in the Montgomery case could be important, his attorneys argue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing for us could be more material than a witness who says Mr. Montgomery is not responsible for the deaths of Jeff Shelton and Sean Clark,&#8221; said attorney Duane Bryant.</p>
<p>But Fant and prosecutors have asserted he didn&rsquo;t discard anything that would benefit Montgomery&rsquo;s case. His missing notes simply documented interviews that were also recorded on video or audiotape, prosecutors said, so no evidence has actually been lost.</p>

								<h2>Detective in Police Shooting Case Had Prior Evidence Problems</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Ely Portillo, Charlotte Observer, August 25, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arvin Fant was the lead investigator in a 2003 Charlotte armed robbery case against Muhummad Jaaber, who was convicted of breaking and entering and four counts of armed robbery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the 2003 case, Jaaber had been accused of breaking into a house and robbing several people inside with a handgun, taking more than $1,500 in cash.</p>
<p>But he appealed his conviction because Fant could not produce two statements that witnesses testified they had provided to police.</p>
<p>The two witnesses said they had been interviewed by officers shortly after the crime. One came from a victim who could not identify Jaaber as his assailant, the other from a woman who owned the house where the robbery occurred but wasn&rsquo;t home at the time.</p>
<p>Jaaber&rsquo;s attorneys requested copies of the two statements before the trial, but Fant couldn&rsquo;t find them, court records show. Fant told the N.C. Court of Appeals he searched everywhere he could, including the complete case file at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department&rsquo;s records office.</p>
<p>Fant also questioned officers who might have taken the statements, but they found nothing, either. Officials told the court one statement had been lost and the other one probably wasn&rsquo;t ever written down, even though the witness testified she had been interviewed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jaaber is projected to be released from prison in 2014.</p>

		<p>This is merely typical black work ethic when an actual product has to be produced.<br>
Blacks are either too lazy, or are intellectually unable, to turn out the work products expected of them.  They therefore lean on their white co-workers to &#8220;help&#8221; them.<br>
Help not always asked for, but taken.  In ANY government job where blacks are, you will find them wasting time.  When the product is due, they copy the work of whites, or take entire texts out of white&rsquo;s work and substitute it as their own, or ask the White to &#8220;look it over&#8221; and then ask &#8220;what did you say/do&#8221; for that?  And insert.  Ask, repeat.  Ask, repeat.  And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the atrocious spelling and grammar.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Monroe said he doesn&rsquo;t believe Fant was attempting to manufacture evidence but simply did sloppy police work.:</p>
<p>The best way to assure that there are no SERIOUS weak intellectual links in a police department is to keep black participation to a minimum doing low level work.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll concede there are exceptions; however, the are so many blacks who are incompetent it&rsquo;s best to bypass one or two here and there who are qualified just to assure that events such as this one are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>Notice now the number of billboards advertising some kind of medical care, showing a black with a stethoscope around his neck.  Looks like the left now wants black acceptance in the medical field with their sub-standard medical degree that was awarded them for complaining about being the objects of racism, after getting AA entry and AA grading in order to fill quotas for blacks.</p>
<p>Let the lefties who are too ignorant to know better line up as patients for these blacks so their applications of incompetence can be directed at the right people.</p>

<p>And Demeatrius I first thought was a misspelling. But NO, it is real. Demeatrius needs to move back to Greece to be with his people where crime of this sort is not tolerated.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have to be related, the &#8220;officer&#8221; is black as is the murderer. He knew EXACTLY what he was doing. Look closely at the picture of him, the sinister manipulative look in his eyes. This &#8216;brotha&rsquo; just killed two cracker policemen - da man, do you think this black &#8220;detective&#8221; would do an honest investigation?  Just the look in his eyes would tell me not to trust this &#8216;thug with a title&rsquo; as far as I could throw him.</p>

		<p>I think the black detective purposefully manufactured evidence to at least muddy the water so much that the black murderer would get a lighter sentence and at most get off completely.  Despite what black Americans would say, they think largely in the same manner.  The black detective empathized with the murderer because he&rsquo;s black also and would add to the overwhelming black prison population and black people&rsquo;s hatred/ envy of white people.</p>

It is Hell. From a nearly perfect beginning (save the presence of African slaves), it is now a nearly perfect HELL.</p>

		</legend>
		<p>In the past couple of weeks Indianapolis has had some really embarrassing high profile screw-ups by white officers. One deals with an officer whose BAC was 0.19, but that evidence is inadmissible since the person drawing his blood was not certified. The second one deals with a sergeant who shot at his girlfriend in a neighboring county. Another deals with an officer who wrecked his car off duty and used a private body shop to repair his patrol car. There is a new police chief who has spent most of the past few years in public affairs. Admittedly, he is telegenic and presents an outstanding presence on camera. However, he is under pressure to clean house.  </p>
<p>There is a thought that since the old Indianapolis Police Department was (and may still be) under a consent decree, that the chief is going after all white malefactors to appease &#8220;the concerned ministers&#8221; and other community leaders. This is due to some of the high profile screw ups by black officers in the recent past. I&rsquo;m not saying some of these white officers shouldn&rsquo;t be fired, but they certainly did not come on the force through affirmative action. None of these white officers were accused of drug dealing or gang protection. Their woes tended to occur due to alcohol.  </p>

		<p>How many white detectives and police officers will move heaven and earth when a black officer is killed in the line of duty? This guy can&rsquo;t do the same? More than likely, he didn&rsquo;t want to do the same. How dare one more brotha end up in the joint for something so minor as killing two cops. </p>
<p>Even though Mr. Fant will probably be fired, I&rsquo;m sure some department somewhere will take him on. The affirmative action daisy chain keeps on spinning. </p>

		<p>To German (and others who claim that the only criminals portrayed on TV are white)  Check out A&E;&rsquo;s The First 48.  There you will see real black dysfunction and criminality in all of it&rsquo;s excess and glory.  I&rsquo;m no master at statistics, but it seems that 85 to 95% of the homicide cases shown on this show are committed by blacks.</p>

He just fell into the wrong crowd and couldn&rsquo;t catch a break in this racist society. He will be a &#8220;hero&#8221; in the black community, someone the young ones can look up to.</p>

<p>Jedderman, no offense, but in Greece now, being black and/or muslim just about makes you above the law of the land as it does in the U.S. right now. I also have no idea where the media gets those pics of Whites protesting this or that, all I have seen protesting anything there is black african muslims protesting the the POSSIBLE reduction in their freebies, as will happen in the U.S. also!</p>
