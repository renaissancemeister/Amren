<h1>Hispanics Targeted in Deadly Attacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Weijia Jiang, WJZ-TV (Baltimore), August 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One teen is under arrest and another one is on the loose, after hate crimes are committed against Hispanics in Baltimore City.</p>
<p>The suspect in the latest case is at Central Booking and he will have a bail review. Jermaine Holley is charged with first-degree murder and a hate crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A recent string of brutal attacks near Patterson Park share at least one thing in common, the victims are all Hispanic men, putting community members on high alert.</p>
<p>Early Saturday morning, police found the body of 51-year-old Martin Reyez in the 200-block of Kenwood Avenue.  He was beaten to death with a wooden plank.</p>
<p>Police say 19-year-old Jermaine Holley confessed to the murder, and stated in an interview he has a hatred of Hispanics.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the latest in several incidents we believe may be targeting Hispanic victims,&#8221; said Anthony Guglielmi, Baltimore City Police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week, a young teenager robbed two Hispanic men in the 100-block of North Linwood Avenue before shooting both of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They get approached by an African-American female, who was described as 13 to 15-years-old. This female pulls out a handgun and announces a handgun. Now, because of her age, the victims didn&rsquo;t think she was serious. So they didn&rsquo;t take her seriously, and she made them take her seriously, because she shot both of them,&#8221; said Major Davis, Southeast Police District.</p>
<p>Hispanic community leader Maurcia Peralta said the problem goes beyond the bloodshed. He said there&rsquo;s a cultural gap that has residents scared to report crimes and admits many of his friends are scared of being deported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spanish speaking officers are going door-to-door to explain they do not look for immigration papers when responding to crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanic are the perfect victims they can get robbed they can get hurt and they know that they won&rsquo;t be reported, so it&rsquo;s like a free ride,&#8221; said Barreiro, Baltimore Hispanic Ch of Commerce. {snip}</p>

		<p>So, no compassion here.  Illegals kill whites all the time with their drunk driving and such.  Blacks have been &#8220;hunting&#8221; whites in Baltimore so if blacks have found new prey that is fine with me.</p>

		<p>All over the country, black/brown violence is appearing with increasing frequency.  It will grow steadily, and at some point Whites will be drawn into the struggle.  And there will no longer be room for Responsible Conservatives or Self-Hating White Liberals to hide from the obvious.</p>
<p>We must be prepared now, while we still can.<br>

		<p>This is a problem just begging for city wide ID cams on every building corner or stoplight with high fidelity imagers linked to a biometric ID database with full body photo update being mandatory for everyone every five years.</p>
<p>Then, instead of sending one angry black man to prison for life at 30 grande a year (not that this one might not have ended up there anyway) -while- paying ten Hispanics to act as witnesses by staying on welfare for at least half that, per person, we could assume that everyone was fair game for immigration or violent crime enforcement.</p>
<p>And stop trying to make-nice when the victims are in fact responsible for BOTH the easy-mark encouragement for robbery.</p>
<p>And the 150,000 dollars a year in transfer payments.</p>
<p>Remove the ethnic prey species and you remove the ethnic predators.</p>

<p>The battle between blacks and Mexicans is an embarrassment to White Humanity.   Ethnic and racial war is natural.  Always a competition for resources and territory.  White Humanity just gives all its best stuff away to the lower races who never could have created anything by themselves.  </p>
<p>They teach us Nature. They don&rsquo;t give nuthing away to no body!</p>
<p>We should learn from race Nature.</p>

		<p>Notice how differently the police and media treat this story compared to several other recent incidents in Baltimore where whites were attacked by blacks who used racial slurs during the attacks.  In this case, there is no hesitation to call them &#8220;hate crimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>I figured this was the case when there was no blame of Arizona SB 1070 nor conservative talk radio in the original article.  Notice how easily the cops are able to find evidence that this was a hate crime (even though you had to scour through the web for awhile to find that the suspect is black).  They wouldn&rsquo;t have worked so hard if the victim were white, and the suspect would have uttered anti-white slurs.</p>
<p>Seems like Baltimore is becoming Los Angeles East.</p>

		<p>Fifteen years ago I had numerous discusions with Black co-workers concerning Mexican immigration, legal and otherwise.  It bafled me that Blacks weren&rsquo;t showing much concern about this, even though, they were the group being hurt most as illegals were taking many of the entry level jobs Blacks once occupied. Most Blacks I talked to were more upset about Asians coming in and opening small businesses in Black communities.  I never got any rational explination from them as to why Jackson and Sharpton and all the rest weren&rsquo;t raising hell about this Mexican invasion.  My own conclusion, and it may be wrong, was that Blacks were content with the Mexican thing because they felt a certain comradery with another nonwhite disfunctional group displacing Whitey.  Asians and Middle Easterners come in here with nothing and for the most part, work their way up in a generation or two.  Blacks don&rsquo;t want to see that stuff, especially in their own nieghborhoods. I think a conversation I had with a Black woman 20 years ago probably illustrates their thinking.  I grew up in Cicero Illinois, probably the most anti-integration town in the country, at least it was 50 years ago.  This Black woman was just beaming with schaden freude as she pointed out to me that, &#8220;You White people were so worried about Blacks moving in and now Mexicans have taken over your town&#8221;.  She was right too.  Like most Blacks though, she probably never considered that they would eventually take over their towns.  Their chickens are coming home to roost.</p>

		<p>The ethnics are doing what they know to do, crime, hate, envy, strife, demanding caretaking, and the whites who sympathize with them and support them, &#8220;I loathe those white fools.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Self hating whites who have no understanding nor appreciation for their race and for the history of peoples throughout time.  If we could develop our civilizations through Christianity and Democracy why couldn&rsquo;t they?  If we could invent, develop, expand, and produce the lifestyles we now enjoy, &#8220;why couldn&rsquo;t they do the same?&#8221;  </p>
<p>Giving up, surrendering our lifestyle, our riches to the undeserving, is a waste of precious beauty and talent.  They are too ignorant to care or appreciate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hate crime on their part, not ours.</p>

Fritz, they assume they ARE the middle class now.  They have &#8216;made it&rsquo; and whether by dint of welfare fraud or political favoritism or a general misperception of what it is to be qualified for the kinds of social roles they now occupy, there is a sense of seniority in their &#8216;establishment&rsquo; views.</p>
<p>Think Union.</p>
<p>And the Mexicans, for the most part, are willing to accept their present role as simple laborers, eschewing the values of higher education as class enablement and political activism as an in to the promises-promises handout system to form collectives of their own.  Collectives which grow at a rate that dwarfs that of even black fertility.</p>
<p>The problem is and always will be:</p>
<p>A.  Work Product.<br>
What a typical white did with an IQ of 100-105 in the 50s and 60s is no longer good enough to competitively support a bureaucracy of idiots in the 85-90 range today.</p>
<p>B.  Assimilation.<br>
If you won&rsquo;t breed together, your individual slices of pie will never get larger except by annihilative overpop and the resulting infrastructure stress that that creates.</p>
<p>C.  Genetics.<br>
The Supremes just decided it was illegal to experiment on stem cells (again) because &#8216;that might kill an embryo&rsquo;.  The Chinese, through an international clearing house not subject to treatied oversight, are putting together several THOUSAND gene sequencer hoods that will look at increasingly long segments of DNA.  They are looking for markers for intelligence and they have a huge population of gifted students from which to make comparitive samples.  Since we refuse to admit (despite a .73 correlation in job satisfaction/effectivenes/salary) that there ARE definitions of &#8216;a person&rsquo;s value&rsquo; heritably defined by racial group genetic predisposition (as environmental optimization), we are going to face pressure from within to support an increasingly stupid mixed population while without we are literally going to be facing 120+IQs as &#8216;the new norming&rsquo; bar-setter population becomes Asian.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br>
Elite Whites are trying to set up a new manorial plantation system.  One where Mestizos are the janitors and farmers, blacks the middlemen salesmen bureaucrats and whites the royalty.  They have no loyalty whatsoever to the poorer white gene base which created them and they think that they can buy-trade-sell for whatever they need via the smart Asian and European societies.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t going to work because we cannot produce anything with the kinds of dumb labor we are using that others cannot match cheaper, better.  And we cannot sustain ourselves &#8216;within the system&rsquo; we are creating so long as we also refuse to go towards massive automation.  While those physical resources we have to trade are all WTO fixed, debt burdened, and finite.</p>
<p>In ten more years the only value left in this country will be it&rsquo;s real property and then you will see America, deliberately stripped of it&rsquo;s ethnic homogeny and unable to fight for race-as-land, go up on the block to become the first corporately owned super state.</p>

		<p>Wait till the blacks decide Middle Eastern Muslims are fair game.  The Mexicans, who produce welfare anchor babies we must support, drive drunk down our roads without insurence, drive down wages for working Americans, march down our streets waving Mexican flags and then tell us to go back to Europe are a singularly unsympathetic group of victims, but Middle-Eastern Muslims would be even less so, if such a thing can be imagined.</p>
<p>The acme of British international diplomacy in her imperial days can be summed up as &#8220;Let&rsquo;s you and him fight&#8221;, and we may be seeing that domestically.  Depending on how this is managed - to the extent that it can be managed - this may not be a bad development.</p>
<p>In the face of &#8220;incidents&#8221; (when do they stop being incidents and begin to constitute a pattern?) like these - blacks murdering Hispanics on the east coast, Hispanics ethnically-cleansing blacks out of parts of SoCal - one can only wonder how long the left will be able to cling to their favorite fiction that &#8220;diversity is our strength.&#8221;  The US motto &#8220;E pluribus unum&#8221; (from many into one) resembles so closely the old Austro-Hungarian motto &#8220;Viribus unitis&#8221; (with common effort) as to be alarming - as well as wildly delusional - under present circumstances.</p>

		<p>It is interesting how the story says the attacks are racially motivated, but do not mention the race of the attackers save for describing only one juvenile female as an African American near the end of the article. It reminds me of those attacks perpetrated by blacks on Asian students at a Philadelphia area high school not too long ago. I read three articles from the mainstream press declaring these attacks racially motivated, but not one mentioned the race of the attackers. It was not until independent news agencies and blogs reported that the attackers were black that the mainstream press would go anywhere near that fact with a 10 foot pole. If you still question the agenda of the media which is protect their heavily melanated pets and to vilify Whitey, please find any article about Whites attacking non-Whites. The stories ALWAYS begin with &#8220;A group of White teens&hellip; White supremacists&hellip; White White White White White&hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>Whites have all but been driven out of Baltimore except for pricy areas close to the water in the Harbor area and the old money, big mansion parts near the main campus of Johns Hopkins. The city on weekends predictably has up to ten homicides and many more attempted murders and rapes, all of which are committed by blacks, usually on blacks but sometimes on hapless whites like the poor Hopkins researcher who foolishly thought he could walk on the streets near the campus at 11PM and live. His low IQ black killers&rsquo; photos graced the national media and Amren recently.</p>
<p>Now the Hispanics are the victims. But not for long. While I think most of them need to go back to Latinland, they are smarter and better at collective action than blacks. As in DC, they will displace blacks in large areas of the city, get the local media on their side, and in the shade build gang organizations like the Latin Kings that make the pathetic Bloods look like the fluff boys they are. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to say in Espagnol the apocalypse is coming for the blacks of Baltimore, but the sky just got real dark. </p>

Please, I beg of you, tell me that all of this hate and violence isn&rsquo;t true. We  desperately need a national dialog on race just as Eric Holder has called for. If the uncaring, selfish white folks would just become more understanding, compassionate and generous towards our lovely brothers and sisters of color, none of these despicable things would have happened, right?    </p>

<p>Hispanics in Baltimore are, for the most part, displacing poor whites, not blacks. And hispanic gangs (MS-13, Sur 13, etc.) are already there; they are just outnumbered and intimidated by the blacks.</p>

<p>I think you are wrong here.  Blacks, because I speak to many of them, are beginning to grasp that they are on &#8220;death&rsquo;s ground&#8221; in this country, that is, they have no where to go.  When people begin to view themselves in this matter watch out, because they realize they have nothing to lose by going all out.  No, on the contrary, it will be the hispanic gangs that will be in grave circumstances.  You&rsquo;ll see.</p>

		<p>In response to commentators #19 &amp; 20, the sheer numbers of blacks in Baltimore right now do give them domination. But even if they, the blacks, continue to run city hall, the school board and the police dept, the hispanics will prevail. The DC and LA models show us what is in store. </p>
<p>Blacks lack the organizational abiltity to defend themselves against a determined enemy(whites aren&rsquo;t determined but hispanics are) and the blacks today are basically the same cowards as the slaves who failed to violently overthrow slavery despite the fact that they vastly outnumbered whites in the South prior to the Civil War.</p>
<p>Every Hispanic killed by blacks in Baltimore will simply spur additional Latin gangs, increased political action by Latinos which the O&rsquo;Malley liberals in MD will yield to, and eventual black flight to the already blacker suburbs around Baltimore. </p>
<p>Those displaced whites you guys refer to, btw, in many cases have run off to the Eastern Shore of MD (fifty miles or more away) or to rapidly growing towns and suburbs in southern  Pennsylvania, only an hour&rsquo;s drive from Baltimore suburbs where there are still jobs for whites. Baltimore except for the rich around the Harbor area will be as Latino as once black Watts is today. </p>
<p>If you live in MD guys (19 &20), look at the county and state road crews in and around Baltimore. I don&rsquo;t hear a word of English spoken. And they sure ain&rsquo;t speaking Chinese or Russian. </p>

<p>IMO, the demographic situation in LA is not analogous to DC/Maryland. The black population in SoCal was relatively small, geographically isolated from other black population centers, and thus easily overwhelmed by the hispanic tidal wave coming (mostly) from Mexico just 3 hours away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks lack the organizational abiltity to defend themselves against a determined enemy(whites aren&rsquo;t determined but hispanics are) and the blacks today are basically the same cowards as the slaves who failed to violently overthrow slavery despite the fact that they vastly outnumbered whites in the South prior to the Civil War.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some truth to what you&rsquo;re saying, but despite this, if you really look at what&rsquo;s happened in LA, hispanic gangs have really gotten their noses bloodied going up against black gangs  &mdash;  despite the fact that they greatly outnumber them. For example, the first major gang war between black and hispanics in LA happened in the Oakwood section of Venice in the early 90s. Oakwood was a neighborhood that historically had a black majority, but by the 80s saw hispanics as the largest ethnic/racial group. The Mexican Mafia ordered hispanic gangs in the area to attack the local Crip gang and wrest control of the lucrative drug trade from them. 10 months and 30 or so bodies later, the the Mexican Mafia ordered their gangs to a truce after twice as many hispanics had been killed as blacks. Til this day, blacks still dominate the drug trade in Venice. </p>
<p>Another example is from Compton, where more recently what was once the largest hispanic gang in the city, Varrio Tortilla Flats, declared a &#8220;race war&#8221; on all blacks. The Bloods in Compton completely trashed these guys, to the extent that Tortilla Flats don&rsquo;t really exist in Compton today  &mdash;  they lost nearly all of their turf. </p>
<p>IMO hispanics won inner city LA through demographics, not gang &#8220;warfare.&#8221; In fact, they never got aggressive with blacks in the streets until they greatly outnumbered them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baltimore except for the rich around the Harbor area will be as Latino as once black Watts is today.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see that happening. If it does, it will be a much, much slower process than what happened in LA.</p>

<p>I have to agree with this assessment.  I think the blacks are being greatly underestimated by whites and especially by Hispanics.  While some blacks may exhibit cowardice, as with other groups, others on the other hand exhibit a real &#8220;scorched earth&#8221; kind of mindset.  As far as organizing, I watched a movie a couple of years ago talking about a black group in the South in the sixties called the deacons for defense (most former military I think) who went up against the K with success.  The Farrakhan group is also very organized and warned the Hispanic gangs and black gangs not to cross them.  Thus far, neither group has.  Adam may be right, but from what I hear from blacks on the job they feel that their backs are getting ever closer to the wall and sense a war coming between them and Hispanics.  I hope the Hispanics have not underestimated them.  Not for nothing but, if what Anonymous wrote is true, I think the blacks would prevail in a conflict.  </p>
