<h1>Protesters Interrupt Baseball Game Over Arizona Immigration Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Martin, CNN, August 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The fierce debate over a new Arizona immigration law spread to America&rsquo;s pastime Sunday as a group of protesters rushed on to the field during the 5th inning of the Washington Nationals-Arizona Diamondbacks game in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>As security guards tackled one protester, another tried to sprint across. In all, four were eventually escorted away from Nationals Park.</p>
<p>Amateur video posted on YouTube showed a woman being chased by several security guards before they caught up with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s getting cuffed,&#8221; a fan is heard saying on the tape.</p>
<p>Then, another protester took to the field running away from security guards towards center field before he too was subdued.</p>
<p>Moments later, two women tried to unfurl a banner in the outfield but were interrupted by another security guard.</p>
<p>As the events unfolded, some of the game attendees booed the protesters and cheered the guards.</p>

		<p>A similar thing happened at Citi Field in New York when AZ played the New York Mets.  A Chicano Hispanic looking man ran across the field waving a Mex flag, and the security tackled him.  The crowd cheered the security on.  I&rsquo;m hoping they were cheering because they didn&rsquo;t like the open borders message, but this being New York City and all, they were probably cheering merely because someone was being taken down.</p>

		<p>I wonder if they have any idea that what they did gathered not a single new person to their cause.</p>
<p>But woke up alot of people to the fact that they should be concerned over the issue.</p>
<p>This is the great weakness of communists everywhere.  Deep down, they just want attention&hellip;.to shout from the rooftops that they are communists (fascists, La Raza, etc. etc.)  They think, in their crazy minds, that large numbers of people will then rally to their cause, join the revolution, whatever.  And are quite surprised when the opposite happens.  Instead, people wake up to their presence and the need to resist them.</p>
<p>Davide Horowitz, recently, has been talking alot about this.  The adherents of Saul Alinsky did so much in the shadows only to have those that follow them, ruin it all, because they simply cannot resist the temptation to draw attention to what is going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a group of vampires, that slowly sucks the lifeblood of a town, building their numbers, but then cannot resist the temptation to run around at high noon, screaming aboooga boooga boooga at the townsfolk.  Then they get a puzzled look on their faces just before the light of the sun burns them to a crisp.  </p>

<p>Are these participants (protesters) in the rent a mobs, that the enemy from within use, just like they did during the Civil Rights era and the illegal alien protests?  How about the rent a mobs, whenever the WN try to have a peaceful march or meeting? </p>

		<p>If you havent ever seen the Rick Monday flag moment on You tube watch it. He was the ballplayer who snatched an about to be burned flag from the hands of two hippes..(father and son hippies actually) resulting in one of the most famous events in MLB history.<br/>
 What I loved most was that as the two broke onto the field a seen it all Kurt Gowdy announces &#8220;Wait a minute&hellip;Looks like we`ve got an animal loose&#8221;. Sounds pretty much like the case here.<br/>
  Rick Monday was also famous for (help me here fans) single handedly knocking out Montreal from World Series contention. They still call it &#8220;Blue Monday&#8221;.. The player himself told how 25 years on he would be accosted in the Canadian customs line by French speaking supervisors who would hold him just long enough to make him miss his connecting flight.</p>

		<p><i> The fierce debate over a new Arizona immigration law</i></p>
<p>If it were conservatives causing the scuffle, it would be &#8220;raucous.&#8221; But because its lefties causing the problems, the debate is &#8220;fierce&#8221; (like a lion, I suppose).</p>
<p>These MSM writers all use the same stylebook.</p>

		<p>Although careful reading leaves one with the distinct impression that these &#8220;protesters&#8221; were pro-illegal. It&rsquo;s interesting how this governmedia article dances around saying so explicitly.  One wonders, if the protesters had been <i>anti</i>-illegals, CNN would have treated the matter so gingerly   &mdash;   or brushed it aside so quickly.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;As the events unfolded, <b>some</b> of the game attendees booed the protesters and cheered the guards.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>What, only <i>some</i> of them?  Why, that makes it sound like the removal of the agitators wasn&rsquo;t a very popular move, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Governmedia propaganda: it&rsquo;s a full-time job.<br/>

		<p>What makes this even more outrageous is that apparently the Diamondbacks are the only AZ team being boycotted.</p>
<p>The reason: the basketball, football and hockey franchises are owned by Democrats while the D-backs are owned by a Rebublican, albeit a liberal RINO who opposes the new law.<br/>

		<p>This is yet another example of how the radical left is full of what amounts to malcontents. To them, the &#8220;great unwashed&#8221; enjoying a ball game, let alone living their lives in peace and harmony is anathema.</p>
