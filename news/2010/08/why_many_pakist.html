			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ron Scherer, Christian Science Monitor, August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Many of the Pakistani-Americans who live in ethnically diverse Jackson Heights, Queens, are saddened by the flooding in their homeland and even have relatives among the displaced.</p>
<p>But, despite family ties, many aren&rsquo;t giving to the relief effort because they simply don&rsquo;t trust the Pakistani government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whether the corruption allegations are true or not, perceptions that money would be wasted is one reason relief organizations say contributions for flood victims are way down.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a tepid response, it is down significantly from other disasters of recent times,&#8221; says Ken Berger, president of Charity Navigator, a Glen Rock, N.J., evaluator of charities. &#8220;There could be a host of different reasons  &mdash;  from donor fatigue to people not feeling comfortable because of their concerns about terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although some people may not give because of their concerns about corruption, he says those same concerns existed for Haiti, where contributions after January&rsquo;s earthquake far outpaced the rate of giving in the aftermath of Pakistan&rsquo;s flooding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Thursday, the slow giving is one reason why Hillary Clinton will visit the United Nations for a General Assembly plenary session on the humanitarian situation in Pakistan. Last week, the UN appealed for pledges of $460 million. The US responded with a pledge of $90 million but other nations have been slower, says Mr. MacSorley [Dominic MacSorley, the operations director of Concern Worldwide].</p>
<p>For example, MacSorely says 10 days after the earthquake hit Haiti, there were pledges equal to $495 for each person affected by the disaster. So far, he says there have been pledges of $3 for each person affected by the flooding.</p>

<p>But how much money did the UN itself pledge? Is that utterly worthless organization of Western Marxists loons and Third World thugs going to shave off $460 million from its budget, in other words? </p>
<p>I think not!</p>
<p>Laughably, how much will Haiti give, since there should be heightened empathy for the plight of the Pakistanis because of what they went through; for that matter, how much of the Pakistani budget will be diverted to these flooded unfortunates in their own country? After all, they do maintain a nuclear arsenal and a considerable conventional military force, couldn&rsquo;t some money be transferred from these areas on the grounds of internal humanitarian necessity?</p>
<p>Oh of course not, that would be asking too much!</p>
<p>Yet again, the guilt trip is laid at the feet of the West and ironically (in this case) Pakistanis living in it, to supply the cheese and checks. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Pakistanis are descendants of corrupt treacherous Hindus who converted to Islam to escape taxation and gain social mobility when Greater India was ruled by Muslim invaders, so it&rsquo;s no wonder Pakistan is so corrupt: all those bad genes entrenching themselves with every passing generation for half a millenium.</p>

		<p>When do Moslems give money for anything except building another money-pit mosque?  When people suffer misfortune, their attitude is &#8220;Allah wills it&#8221;.  They might toss a beggar a few alms to balance out their sins for the Day of Judgment, but altruism is a foreign concept.  <br>
As for Haiti, the island is our perpetual basket-case neighbor and, as far as I know, has no intentions of destroying Western civilization and replacing it with sharia barbarism.</p>

		<p>Footdragging by Pakistan, in terms of administering aid to victims of natural disasters is nothing new. Consider:</p>
<p>In October 1970, East Pakistan was hit by a horrific cyclone which killed anywhere from 300,000 to 1 million people. British aid arrived in East Pakistan about two weeks ahead of the aid sent by West Pakistan. The East Pakistanis never forgot the West Pakistani tardiness, and voted for a pro-independence party in the national elections in December of that year.</p>
<p>The result was that the pro-independence Awami League gained the most seats in Pakistan&rsquo;s legislature. Yahya Khan invalidated the election, and sent troops into East Pakistan on March 25, 1971 to crush the uprising. This eventually resulted in war with India, and Bangladesh&rsquo;s independence.</p>
<p>No U.S. aid to Pakistan. Let a hundred flowers bloom on Pakistan&rsquo;s grave. Let a hundred jackals contest over her remains.  </p>

		<p>Why is it that when we have a disaster relatively few die, but THOUSANDS die elsewhere? Don&rsquo;t they EVER learn to build to aviod these disasters? I&rsquo;m sure they can afford to as all of them have received tons of aid money for as long as I can remember, and I ain&rsquo;t no spring chicken. Not to mention the THOUSANDS of guilt-ridden do-gooder Whites that go to thoses places to build roads, schools, hospitals etc.. Pakistan is not OUR problem. Haiti is not OUR problem. We acually borrow money from China, to help CHINA when they have a disaster and they&rsquo;ve got more money than God. It&rsquo;s insanity!</p>

I believe disaster fatigue is setting in in regards to Americans response as well.</p>
<p>Every year, Americans are asked to &#8216;save the victims of this or that disaster&rsquo;. The disasters keep coming. We in the US have our own disasters. Americans are learning they can&rsquo;t save everyone from everything.</p>
<p>Americans should act locally to our disasters. By acting locally, the global community isn&rsquo;t obligated to help us. Other nations should be acting locally as well. </p>
<p>I understand the unpredictability of some natural disasters but in a continent that has dealt with monsoons for centuries, one would believe knowledge of flood plains and weather patterns would be better understood.</p>

		<p>Regarding this flooding, nowhere is there any mention that this is the inevitable result of over-population, deforestation, excessive use of the land, etc.  And nowhere is there any mention of taking steps to correct those underlying causes. Which means that, just as with Africa, there will be a repeat of the same catastrophe within a space of every so many years. And it will get worse, not better.   All accompanied with more appeals for aid, naturally.</p>

		<p>Have you ever wondered what happened to that cash donated following the the Pakistan earthquake 5 years back? The DEC only collects cash donations, not tents, food or water purification equipment, and has an impressive list of charity and aid organisations which it supports yet there is little indication of the proportion doled out to each. It was acknowledged (eventually) that some of the earthquake fund was diverted by Islamic Relief to Hamas in Gaza to fund purchase of rockets to launch at schools in Israel and many of the publicly announced projects within Pakistan including roads, bridges, schools, clinics and drinking water wells were never even started although funds were available and allocated to rebuild specific named rural villages. Recently, the Pakistan government admitted that millions of $US have yet to be spent on earthquake reconstruction and have been &#8216;held over&rsquo; or used on associated works, whatever that means. Since the monsoon occurs every year, surely by now Pakistan would have learned to provide for flood victims well in advance instead of building nuclear weapons which could possibly fall into the hands of Islamic terrorists. No wonder the world is a little wary about sending loads of cash which will, as events have shown, simply disappear and be accounted for by lots of hot air and pseudo political waffle mouthed by a variety of very well fed Pakistani government officials on TV.</p>

		<p>The reason the Pakis are not sending money home is that all of their relatives are ALREADY here in America and muslims don&rsquo;t support muslims not of their own tribe, they JUST WON&rsquo;T DO IT. Besides, the muslims and everyone else on planet FN earth knows that the U.S. will pour tons and tons of money onto any real or perceived &#8220;disaster&#8221; involving non whites or other muslims.</p>

		<p>1.  How much will India,its rich neighbor give? Answer: zero. India knows who sponsors terrorism of horrific proportions in India.</p>
<p>2.  How much will wealthy China, Pakistan&rsquo;s most important military and political ally over the past fifty years, contribute? Very little.China takes a Darwinistic approach that the US should emulate.  Allies that can&rsquo;t survive on their own by elimination of the weak and survival of the strong, aren&rsquo;t worth a relationship. We should let Afghnistan sink into its own corruption by reference to this sensible, evolutionary based policy.</p>
<p>3. Pakistan, Hillary fears, won&rsquo;t help us fight &#8220;terrorism&#8221; if we don&rsquo;t in effect make Pakistan the 51st state and pour billions of deficit fiat US funds into that rathole. Hillary, shake off the champagne buzz from your lovely daughter&rsquo;s wedding.  Pakistan is a terrorist state, abets Al Queda, loves radical Islam, and offers an open border to the Taliban that receives Pakistani sanctuary.</p>
<p>4. Despite the absurdity of sending Pakistan any US funds (of course the funds don&rsquo;t exist because we are broke), I feel certain that if we deport all Pakistani &#8220;Americans&#8221;, legal or illegal, back to Pakistan forever, to rebuild their homeland, they and Pakistan will be eternally grateful and praise Allah for inspiring the heathen Christians to do the right thing. The bank accounts and high priced real estate the Pakistani doctors and businessmen leave behind in the US can be confiscated in partial payment for the costs incurred by Pakistani terrorism in Central and South Asia, not to mention terrorism in Europe and America, including 9/11, that had direct and indirect ties to Pakistan.</p>

		<p>Any death in this disaster either from drowning or disease is a tragedy, whether it be a newborn child child or an old man. But have a look at the bigger picture, we a dealing with one of the most overpopulated parts of planet earth. We see TV pictures of the affected families, 10 children seems to be quite normal. We see people living in towns and farms build right in the Indus Valley flood plain. It would not matter if the West were to give ten billion dollars in aid or accept 10 million refugees it will not help with the unsustainable population time bomb that exists either in the Indus Valley or the the rest of the 3rd world.</p>
<p>And, Agree with #7, are Pakistan&rsquo;s oil rich (Islamic) neighbours contributing $$$ to this disaster???</p>

<p>Exactly.  The number of dead in Pakistan is equivalent to 6% of their annual population growth, which means it will take 22 days to replace them.</p>
