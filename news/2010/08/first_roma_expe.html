			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, August 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first 93 ethnic Roma who agreed to the &#8220;voluntary return procedure&#8221; have left France and landed in Bucharest on Thursday afternoon, as part of a plan of French authorities to expell people living in illegal camps.</p>
<p>The 93 ethnic Roma who agreed to a &#8220;voluntary return procedure&#8221; landed in Bucharest on Thursday afternoon, as part of moves by Paris to expel foreign-born Roma living in France without a permit.</p>
<p>Romanian President Traian Basescu said: &#8220;Romania has no objection to France&rsquo;s plans to tackle illegal immigration, but it is also supporting the right of any Romanian citizen to travel freely around European Union.</p>
<p>&#8216;We need to co-operate better with France on this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kristalina Georgieva, the EU commissioner on International Co-operation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, expressed concerns over France&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;France&rsquo;s decision to deport Roma is worrisome for Brussels because it can lead to tension in Bulgaria,&#8221; she told local private television channel Nova TV.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roma should not be assimilated. They should be integrated to become part of society&rsquo;s productive capacity,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The French government began the deportation of around 700 Roma people of Romanian and Bulgarian citizenship from illegal camps earlier on Thursday.</p>
<p>Those on the flight had agreed to the so-called &#8220;voluntary return procedure&#8221; under which each adult was granted €300 and each child €100.</p>
<p>Around 412 Roma people will be repatriated to Romania by the end of the month, Romanian state secretary Valentin Mocanu has said.</p>
<p>A total of 41 Roma are also being deported from France to Bulgaria, local broadcaster Darik Radio reported.</p>
<p>The first group of 13 will return on a flight from Paris to Varna, the country&rsquo;s biggest seaside city, on August 25th, while the remainder will arrive on two additional flights on September 10th and 17th, said Bulgaria Air officials quoted by Darik radio.</p>
<p>Deyan Petrov, chairman of Amalipe, a Roma rights organisation based in the Bulgarian town of Veliko Tarnovo, said France&rsquo;s decision was discriminative.</p>
<p>He told Balkan Insight: &#8220;We should remember that during World War II Nazis in Germany killed many Roma, claiming that they were fighting crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that there are probably some alleged criminals in Roma camps in France, but you can&rsquo;t dismantle the whole camp just because of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&rsquo;s a mass return of [jobless] Roma to Bulgaria, this could turn into a social crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The office of the French president said in a statement the camps were &#8220;sources of illegal trafficking, of profoundly shocking living standards, of exploitation of children for begging, of prostitution and crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>It added new legislation would be introduced soon to make the expulsion from France of illegal immigrants from Eastern Europe easier &#8220;for reasons of public order&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rights groups across Europe have attacked France&rsquo;s decision, saying it violated human rights and the Roma were often treated like a sub-class of immigrants and targeted by police.</p>
<p>The Roma community in Romania numbers about 535,000 people according to the national census.</p>
<p>But non-governmental organisations, NGOs, say the figure is probably between 1.5-2 million as many do not declare themselves as Roma amid fears of being discriminated.</p>
<p>Roma in Bulgaria number about 370,000 people according to government statistics.</p>
<p>But NGOs say the actual number is nearer 700,000.</p>
<p>The minority is extremely marginalised, they say, as most live in poor conditions, suffer widespread discrimination and racism and have difficulties finding a job.<br>

						<p>
							<i>AFP, August 17, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A total of 93 Roma were expected to arrive in Romania on Thursday on regular flights from France following a French clampdown on the minority, the interior ministry said.</p>
<p>Romanian President Traian Basescu meanwhile stressed the expulsions showed the need for a Europe-wide plan on integrating Roma communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened in Paris shows that we must have an integration plan across Europe for Roma citizens,&#8221; Basescu told reporters.</p>
<p>He said a previous call along similar lines had failed to result in action because some states, which he did not name, failed to see the &#8220;necessity&#8221; of such a move.</p>
<p>A planeload of around 60 Roma who agreed to a &#8220;voluntary return procedure&#8221; left Lyon airport for Bucharest in the afternoon, the first expulsion since President Nicolas Sarkozy last month vowed action against Roma, Gypsy and traveller communities.</p>
<p>A total 93 Roma were to be flown out Thursday, with flights to Bucharest and the western city of Timisoara due to take hundreds more on Friday and August 26, with each adult granted 300 euros (385 dollars) and each minor 100 euros.</p>
<p>Representatives from various state institutions including the child protection office, the national agency for Roma and the police would be on hand when they arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand problems created by Roma camps outside French cities&#8221;, Basescu said. &#8220;But we also support the right of every European citizen to travel freely in the Union&#8221;, he added.</p>
<p>Basescu underlined that Romania faced the same type of issues regarding Roma who had travelled to Italy.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we resolved the problem effectively by sending more police officers there. We will do the same with France&#8221;, he stressed.</p>
<p>The Romanian president insisted Romania &#8220;does not want an assimilation programme&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every European citizen has the right to keep its culture and tradition&#8221;, he said. &#8220;Those who are travelling around are probably the ones that are nomadic gypsies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Europe counts between 10 and 12 million Roma, according to official European estimates.</p>
<p>The Roma community in Romania numbers 530,000 according to the national census or 2.5 million according to non-governmental organisations, who say that some do not declare themselves as Roma, fearing discrimination.<br>

		<p>For centuries, the gypsies have been a nuisance, plain and simple.  They&rsquo;ve had every chance to become normal, productive citizens of various countries, but most have apparently continued the old ways of lawlessness.  The French put tremendous emphasis on their culture and language and will probably be one nation that heartily resists sinking to third-world standards.</p>

<p>I wonder why in the debate here in the states the argument for illegal immigrants is the opposite.  No one says it will cause upheaval in mexico.  They say America will be crushed economically if the illegals leave.</p>

		<p>France is leading example of what countries need to do.<br>
Restore political backbone, act and secure the safety of native citizens.  This global transient chaos needs to be stopped by elected who are supposed to keep laws and protect citizens.<br>
Weakness has no place in leadership of national enforcement of laws.  The Constitution guarantees equal protection under the laws - - -  not distorted judgements issued by selected judges.</p>

<p>Another comedian. Just mention the nazis, or fascists whenever you&rsquo;re losing the arguement. It works for the greenies. The old left-wing chestnut&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is another inherent contradiction in the structure and governance of the EU, such that will ensure the EU&rsquo;s eventual destruction in the future.<br>
 The irony is that France is the real power behind the EU, and that French NGOs and the French government are always the first to hector and bully (to the extent of threatening economic and financial sanctions), Romania for allegedly maltreating Gypsies.<br>
  The wider point is that constitutionally, the EU guarantees &#8216;freedom of movement and settlement&rsquo; for all the citizens of its member states.This means that all of Romania&rsquo;s Gypsies (over 2 million of them), have the guaranteed &#8216;right&rsquo; to move in on the French - and to claim French social security.<br>
 We musn&rsquo;t for a moment forget that the French were very eager to rush Romania (a state with GDP per capita a fraction of that in France), into the EU.</p>

<p><br>
&#8220;Difficulties finding a job&#8221;? Is this guy joking? The entire Gypsy Way of Life is consciously and deliberately dedicated to NOT getting a job! All the pickpocketing, burgling, prostitution, gambling, and all the other small-time scamming for which the &#8220;Roma&#8221; (who are NOT white, Eastern-European type Romanians, BTW) are notorious worldwide is because scamming is part of their hideous subculture&rsquo;s &#8220;Code of Honor&#8221; which states that a Gypsy does NOT work for a living! They are crooks not only in practice, but by philosophy! </p>
<p>In this respect Gypsies are worse than Africans. Black people worldwide may be work-averse and liesure-oriented, but at least they aren&rsquo;t UNITED IN PHILOSOPHICAL OPPOSITION TO WORK like Gypsies are. </p>

<p>No. What they need is a repatriation plan. Gypsies aren&rsquo;t native to Europe. This is what happens when illegal aliens are allowed to stay too along.</p>
<p>I recall an old song by Cher that mentions &#8220;Gypsies, tramps, and thieves.&#8221; When considering gypsies it&rsquo;s important to remember that last one. Many people don&rsquo;t realize that the gypsy &#8220;religion&#8221; encourages theft. Yeah. That&rsquo;s right. Their religion tells them to <i>steal</i>. Is it any wonder people don&rsquo;t want them around?</p>

		<p>I am on no way apologizing for the anti-social behavior of gypsies but it&rsquo;s obvious that they are not a politically protected ethnicity as just as obviously North Africans, Blacks and Arabs who, I would wager commit a larger percentage of the mayhem in France.<br>
No one is going to rush to support the cause of the gypsies. </p>

<p>You should learn what the Muslim ideology allows its worshipers to get away with, beheading is not the least of it. NO! France will NEVER get away with this conduct towards the black African Muslim which, in my opinion, have less justification for being in Europe, or ANY White country for that matter.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an old Gypsy legend that says that on the day of Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion there was a Gypsy present on Golgotha. The story goes that the Romans had four nails; two for hands and two for feet. The legends goes on to say that the Gypsy stole one of the nails thereby sparing Jesus the pain of the hammering of the final nail. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense since pain wise since they always represent the crucifixion with his feet nailed together.<br>
They believe that God, to show his gratitude, granted the Gypsies the right to steal. </p>
