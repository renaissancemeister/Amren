			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Gonz√°lez, Arizona Republic, August 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just a few years ago, when the economy was booming, the area around the Home Depot on Thomas Road and 36th Street in east Phoenix was packed with a couple of hundred men congregating on sidewalks and street corners soliciting work as day laborers.</p>
<p>Day laborers, mostly undocumented Mexican immigrants, also proliferated in other areas around the Valley, places like Avenida del Yaqui in Guadalupe, 43rd Avenue and Camelback Road in west Phoenix and Saguaro Boulevard in Fountain Hills.</p>
<p>But drive by any of those locations now, and only a handful of day laborers are left. And no longer do they rush up to vehicles en masse, waving their hands in a desperate bid to get hired. Now, they are more likely to keep a lower profile, leaning against a tree or sitting on a milk crate.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the change. Arizona&rsquo;s slumping economy has dried up the demand for day laborers, who typically are hired for yard cleaning, moving, tree cutting, construction and other jobs. Many have left Arizona to look for work in other states, or they have given up and returned to Mexico.</p>
<p>And the state&rsquo;s crackdown on illegal immigration also is taking a toll, including parts of Arizona&rsquo;s tough new immigration law that took effect July 29.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, who sponsored the House version of Senate Bill 1070, said one of the law&rsquo;s intentions was to prevent the &#8220;highly disruptive situation that occurred at Pruitt&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>In December 2007, day laborers congregating in front of Pruitt&rsquo;s furniture store and other businesses on Thomas Road near the Home Depot ignited a dispute that dragged on for two months and propelled Arizona&rsquo;s battle over illegal immigration into the national spotlight. The furniture store became a flashpoint in the illegal-immigration debate after it hired off-duty sheriff&rsquo;s deputies to chase away day laborers from its parking lot, leading to demonstrations and counterdemonstrations.</p>
<p>Kavanagh said the law is also aimed at cracking down on the hiring of illegal immigrants because most day laborers tend to be undocumented people who work for cash and therefore don&rsquo;t pay income taxes. The people who hire them also skip out on worker&rsquo;s compensation payments, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But law-enforcement officials say the law is clear. Police can&rsquo;t arrest day laborers just for soliciting work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key consideration is they have to be impeding traffic. It is legal for them to solicit work,&#8221; said Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the day laborers interviewed for this story said they previously worked for construction or landscaping companies. They resorted to day-labor work after they lost their jobs, some because of the economy, others after a state law took effect in January 2008 that sanctions employers caught knowingly hiring illegal immigrants and requires them to run Social Security numbers of new employees though a federal electronic worker-verification system.</p>
<p>Aguilar, the day laborer in front of the Home Depot in east Phoenix, said a few years ago he sometimes got hired twice in the same day, once early in the morning and then again in the afternoon. Now, he said, he&rsquo;s lucky if he gets hired twice in one week.</p>

		<p>I live in Tucson, Arizona. Somtething has been troubling me. It might be relative, subjective, but I don&rsquo;t think so. </p>
<p>I NEVER  see a White man working outside. I have seen many White men sleeping on the sidewalks and under bridges in this town of 1,000,000-plus citizens and non-citizen &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221;. I have never seen a brown homeless man.</p>
<p>Yet is seems that no matter where I go (on walks with the dog, or driving to the market), I see men with dark brown skin building a medical center, doing all of the work (from the ground up) on condo construction, repaving the roads, mowing the lawns, trimming the trees, and painting the apartments, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Despite Jan Brewer&rsquo;s rise to stardom and all the buzz abut sb1070, I think that most institutions (the Tucson and Phoenix police departments and our Pima county sheriff and the mayor of Phoenix, et al) in Arizona are resigned to the permanency of the invaders and the displacement and unemploymed status of American White citizens.</p>
<p>I have voted already for the Arizona primaries (August 23rd) by early ballot. I only voted for the most aggressive anit-illegal-immigrant and pro-impenetrable-border and anti-anchor-baby-citizenship candidates. Anyone endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio got my allegiance. </p>
<p>God bless us this November, 2010.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Arizona&rsquo;s day laborers going to other states or back to Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the reason a few Mexicans are leaving Arizona.  It has nothing to do with the new law, nor are they leaving in droves as the mainfringe media would have us believe in order to make them victims.</p>
<p>As the available non-skilled labor continues to drop, mestizos will be turning to robbery, burglary and selling dope.  But I seriously doubt they will return to the narco-republic to the south, unless it is just one of many trips to get new supplies of drugs from their compadres in the cartels.</p>

		<p>#1, you are right.  I ride the bus and it offends me when the bus stops at the mall, and [I assume illegaly documented] immigrants get on-and-off on their way to or from work at the food court, cleaning services, etc.  At the same time, the white kids are screwing around in the parking lot, skateboarding and texting their friends.</p>
<p>If you have teenage kids, put them to work.  If you have a yard, cut it yourself.  Otherwise you&rsquo;re part of the problem.</p>
<p>Surely illegals do take jobs from Americans willing to work because the illegals work for less money.  But they also take the jobs vacated by an increasing narcisstic, self-indulgent, fat, shameless and lazy class of American that prefers living with their parents into their twenties or living off entitlements.</p>

		<p>We have Home Depots in Canada, and no such thing ever happens. (unemployed day-labourers standing around the parking lots). That&rsquo;s only because we are far from the Mexican border.</p>
<p>There is a reason for having a stable population.  It is to live within nature&rsquo;s limitations.  If no labour is available, and nobody wants to bid up the price for labour, a job won&rsquo;t get done.  That is no tragedy. </p>
<p>I am happy when labour shortages suppress growth.  Growth is not the highest purpose of a civilization.</p>

		<p>Like these illegal &#8220;laborers&#8221; don&rsquo;t come here to commit crimes, drive drunk, rape and murder, set up their marijuana crops in the Sierra, meth labs all over CA. run drugs, join gangs, etc. etc. </p>
<p>The above is WHY they come here and their &#8220;jobs&#8221; are just a cover for what they really do!</p>

		<p>Poster #4 hit the nail on the head.  Do not hire illegals for anything, even lawn work.  Do it yourself or have your kid do it.</p>
<p>The only problem is that immigrants of every variety have no qualms about hiring other immigrants to work for them.  In my neighborhood, there are only 2 white families left on the block.  All the rest are Asians of various types.  (Quiet, hard working, so I don&rsquo;t feel under pressure to leave just yet.)</p>
<p>However, they all have those latino lawn people coming to do their yards.  Their lawns look great, but illegals have a job.  (Most Asians I have seen do either no yard work at all, ever, or they sit on their knees with scissors, I am not joking, and clip every individual blade of grass.)</p>
<p>Asians hire illegal immigrants to work in their restaurants (AS COOKS, even in many sushi restaurants).  All the Greek owned diners have a full Mexican staff.  All jewish owned car washes are latino paradises and most kosher restaurants have all latino cooks.  (I have done personal tours of many and can confirm this, as I love middle eastern style food.)  The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>In short, a whole new economy is developing in which immigrants support other immigrants, even as they gnaw away at the fringe of the white economy and siphon off resources.  </p>
<p>The issue is big, but we can take action on an individual level, starting with mowing your own lawn. </p>

		<p>To comment  #1   I  have spent the last 35 years working on the roads and bridges of the midwest. I am white and the only blacks i ever see are driving trucks or flagging traffic. Most of the work is done by whites, because it&rsquo;s hard. I`ve encountered few Hispanics, more from SA than Mexico.</p>

		<p>In the U.K., there are 3 million White males between the age of 18 and 44 who are on the dole. In the U.K., the government takes half your wages in taxes which makes the person worse than a serf. During the Middle-Ages, the ruling class only took a quarter of your crop or labor in the form of taxes.</p>
<p>The oppressive tax structure in the U.K. makes people not want to work and just live off the dole. Illegals get paid $10 an hour for say construction work but feel like they&rsquo;re not being burdened by oppressive tax rates. So, the legal worker feels the oppressive nature of taxation while the illegal feels freedom from oppression and has a higher incentive to work hard. This has the same effect here in the U.S.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t have to pay half my wages in taxes, I&rsquo;d work harder and longer hours just like the illegals. Heavy taxation makes people feel like they&rsquo;re working to support other people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;I NEVER see a White man working outside&hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t see me?  Or you saw me and thought I was Mexican due to the tan?  Here in the Old Pueblo whites work as landscapers, apartment handymen and construction workers.  And construction means everything from journeymen to day laborers hired out of Primavera Foundation&rsquo;s program.  (Primavera is a good source for skilled and unskilled labor.  All participants are legal, grateful for a job and paid a minimum of $7 an hour.)</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I have never seen a brown homeless man&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fer sure, all the borrachos have their rent paid up.  No doubt it&rsquo;s occurred to you Hispanic and American Indian homeless are found outside your usual travels.  Go way past Broadway and you might see one or two.  (Did you borrow this bit of nonsense from black libertarian Thomas Sowell?  You know, the guy who thinks the Irish and the blacks have so much in common.) </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the white kids are screwing around in the parking lot, skateboarding and texting their friends&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile jobs for chimney sweeps and coal miners go unfilled.  The very idea of feckless white youth having fun fills me with utter disgust.  Are there no prisons?  Are there no workhouses?</p>
<p>I saw a white kid on a skateboard so I voted for Gabrielle Giffords.  Then I saw a white kid texting so I voted again for Raul Grijalva.  When I saw a white kid texting while riding a skateboard I voted for Rodney Glassman.  With leaders like these white kids will soon be no problem at all.</p>
