<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.de/society/20100811-29073.html">Migrant Birthrates Falling in Germany, Study Finds</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local Europe (Berlin), August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Second generation immigrants in Germany are having fewer babies than their parents, a new study has revealed, denting the widely-held belief that migrant communities could be the nation&rsquo;s fertility engines.</p>
<p>The study, &#8220;Fertility of Immigrants: A Two-Generational Approach in Germany&#8221;, found that children born in Germany to immigrant parents barely have more children than native Germans, daily Die Welt reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women of the second generation have nearly matched German women in their fertility patterns,&#8221; said study author Nadja Milewski from the University of Rostock.</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that they get married on average two years younger than native Germans and become mothers correspondingly earlier.</p>
<p>Milewski&rsquo;s finding appears to be a further blow to Germany&rsquo;s demographic prospects, which are considered to be bleak because of the country&rsquo;s low birthrate. It also tears apart the anti-immigration thesis that native Germans will eventually be a minority in the country.</p>
<p>Milewski studied extensive data gathered on more than 5,000 West German women between 1984 and 2004, along with immigrant women from the first and second generations from Turkey, southern Europe and southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>By the time the women were 35, some 18.5 percent of them had three or more children  &mdash;  but this figure was just 15 percent for second-generation women from Greece and 15.4 percent for women from the former Yugoslavian countries.</p>
<p>Although second generation women from Italy and Turkey did more commonly have three or more children  &mdash;  33.3 percent and 34.2 percent respectively  &mdash;  the numbers had clearly dropped between the first and second generations. Some 58.8 percent of first generation Turkish women had three or more children, as did 43.6 percent of Italian women.<br>

		<p>Over the long haul, the number of births per adult female is only part of the equation; the average ages at which women have their babies also matter. So, if non-Hispanic white women in the United States, for instance, have two children each, but have them, on average, at ages 30 and 34, while Hispanic women also have two children each, but have them, on average, at ages 15 and 17, then the Hispanics will produce two new generations of offspring for every one generation of non-Hispanic whites, leading the latter to be greatly outproduced by the former in the long run.</p>

		<p>Why are Italian women so fertile in Germany but not Italy?  Maybe chronically single German men should move to Italy or Greece instead.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the migration patterns of non-white people moving into white areas.  This study only looks at Caucasian ethnicities.  It doesn&rsquo;t report on the fertility of East, South, and Central Asian and African immigrants.  Those are the groups that concern me the most and need to be bounced out of Germany.</p>

		<p>I also do not believe this propaganda. They WANT Whites to think that they are not in danger of being overrun with these 3rd world nonwhites. Just look at blacks and nonwhites in this country! Are they reproducing at the same rate as Whites no matter how long they have been here?  No.</p>

		<p>BlueBlood is right. The study excludes immigrants originating outside of Europe, so the &#8220;tearing apart&#8221; of any thesis is mainly happening within the author&rsquo;s own head. Multiculti journalism at its finest.</p>

		<p>Europeans currently enjoy a higher standard of living and health than ever before in history.  A major reason for this is the low birth rate.  When other things are equal, fewer people mean more of everything good to go around.  We can explain the relationship with an equation:<br>
 <br>
(natural resources x level of technology) / human population = standard of living.</p>

<p>Black Africans have much higher birthrates than Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa, in both their native countries and in Europe. The birthrates of most Muslim countries today are surprisingly low.  Blacks are growing as a percentage of the nonwhites in Europe.  This is one of the reasons why the &#8220;counter Jihad movement&#8221; that only talks about Muslims is misguided.  Even if all the Muslims left Europe, there would be a serious and growing problem with other non-whites.  In France especially, it has become really noticeable that there has been explosion of the black population over the last 10 years while the Arab population is about the same.  Anyone who visits Paris now will see this.  Ireland, Italy, Brussels and London have also been overrun with black African immigrants, mostly non-Muslims. </p>

		<p>The massive arrival of foreign migrants from Africa, Asia and points far away are changing the setting of formerly European cities to the point of unreality making them appear more alien by the day. Frankfurt, Berlin, Hamburg and the other large German cities are rapidly losing their European complexion / character and becoming host to third world populations with their foreign way of life.<br>
 Today many German school children face classroom situations where they are the minority with all that this entails. Entire German districts appear today more oriental or African than European with this phenomenon escalating. Once beautiful successful urban areas are taking on the appearance of ghettos and the spread of crime with drugs and violence are respectively on the rise. We may now say good bye to Europe of our youth and make the acquaintance of the new multicultural European world of amorphous masses which lack any genuine identity and or unity. &ldquo;A house divided&hellip;.&rdquo; <br>

		<p>&#8220;immigrant women from the first and second generations from Turkey, southern Europe and southeastern Europe.&#8221; Even disregarding the too narrow selection of ethnic groups measured just a slight differential will in short time compound into a serious problem.<br>
Sounds like propaganda to lull the weak minded and easily led into complacency.</p>

		<p>Hmmmm&hellip;. maybe that&rsquo;s the reason why Germany-settled Turkish families seek brides for their sons among the cousins in Turkish remote Antalya villages and import them. Also, second-generation girls of Turkish origin are often seen as &#8220;tainted&#8221; or &#8220;impure&#8221;. </p>

		<p>John Engelman, Europe&rsquo;s birthrate is nothing to to be proud of. While it&rsquo;s true that a smaller population has its advantages, a birth rate of 1.3 is unsustainable. No society in history has ever survived a 1.3 birthrate. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said before that I believe immigrants will probably become more like the majority of their new nations of residence.  Most of this change, of course, will be in the succeeding generations.  Unless newcomers and their children can seclude themselves in ethnic communities, the influence of the mainstream culture will have a tremendous influence.  Families with one or two children will likely become more common. Abortion might easily become acceptable to young people whose parents would have never considered it.  Most people are not so concerned with their ethnic group being a majority that they will sacrifice to raise large numbers of children.<br>
White people should not despair and declare that all is lost.  The liberals want us to believe this and give up!  The doomsdayers have proclaimed that AIDS would wipe up half of mankind, that Swine flu would decimate the Western world, and so on.  Like I&rsquo;ve stated ad nauseum  &mdash;  whites are the majority in the U.S.  In elections, we can carry any vote if we will just actually vote!</p>
