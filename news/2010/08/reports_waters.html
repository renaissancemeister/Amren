			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KNBC-TV (Los Angeles), July 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., plans to go through a House trial to contest charges of misusing her office, NBC News confirmed Friday night.</p>
<p>A House ethics subcommittee says Waters, 71, improperly intervened in 2008 with federal regulators to help get bailout funds for a bank that her husband owned stock in and on whose board he once served, said NBC and other media reports. Waters also once held stock in the bank.</p>
<p>Formal charges are not expected to be announced until next week, according to several Congressional officials who spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity because the proceedings remained confidential. {snip}</p>
<p>Politico suggested the panel&rsquo;s charging document was delayed because Waters said she would go through with the trial instead of accepting and settling the panel&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The expected trial, coming just after the start of a similar proceeding on Thursday for Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., would be a modern-day precedent for the House, Congressional officials told the Times. At no time in at least the last two decades have two sitting House members faced a public hearing detailing allegations against them, the Times said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Waters] has been under investigation by the House ethics panel since last fall, the Times said. The Times and The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Waters called Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. in 2008, as the economy was in a free fall, to ask him to host a special meeting with executives from black-owned banks.</p>
<p>As a Financial Services Committee member, Waters often called Paulson. He agreed to arrange the requested meeting, the Times reported last year.</p>
<p>Paulson did not know at the time that Waters&rsquo; husband, Sidney Williams, owned stock in and had served on the board of Boston-based OneUnited, whose chief executive turned the Treasury headquarters meeting into a special appeal for bailout assistance, the Times said. OneUnited also had branches in Miami and Los Angeles. Waters&rsquo; district includes part of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The executive from OneUnited, one of the nation&rsquo;s largest black-owned banks, asked for $50 million in federal aid, the Times reported.</p>
<p>OneUnited got $12.1 million in TARP money soon after a second meeting, The Washington Post reported Friday.</p>
<p>Waters has said she called Paulson on behalf of the National Bankers Association, a Washington-based organization of minority-owned banks, to help minority-owned banks get their fair share from the government.</p>

		<p>Believe it or not, she is a native of East St. Louis, and mostly grew up in St. Louis City.</p>
<p>What is curious is the timing of the Democrat-run House Ethics Committee coming down on Rangel and Waters right before election time.  I know that both their districts are majority Hispanic now, Rangel&rsquo;s being mostly Puerto Rican with some Dominican.  And Maxine Waters&rsquo;s district I think went majority Chicano Hispanic a few years ago.</p>

		<p>There is no way that the powerful Dems will let these trials go to the end. Why should any Dem Congressman running for reelection be hurt by these two criminals?  Watch for Waters and Rangel to be dumped well before the trials.  Watch them land in some big foundation with a bigger paycheck than they were making in Congress.  American Center for Progress, SPLC, ADL, NAACP, ACLU, etc. will all hire them as special consultants on &#8220;community development issues&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope not.  Let&rsquo;s hope that their stories get wrapped in racism charges against White Humanity.  Let&rsquo;s hope that somebody on TV responds to comments by the Congressional Black Caucus with, &#8220;Well, okay, and then what did the Congressional White Caucus say about it?&#8221; </p>

		<p>I find it quite funny that the two accused, Waters and Rangel, are so ADAMANT about their innocence!</p>
<p>I would say, How typical! but I agreed to the pledge not to insult groups!</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t say, How typical!</p>

		<p>Tonight, O&rsquo;Reilly was onto the race card played by Waters. Everyone agreed that it will get nasty. O&rsquo;Reilly or Goldberg did the right thing to mention the Congressional Black Caucus as part of the story, but then both of them did the White Thing and predictably failed to take the needful opportunity to ask &#8220;What has the Congressional White Caucus had to say about the racism charges?&#8221;</p>
<p>Good for Fox that it keeps race stories in the news, but bully for them that they don&rsquo;t expand their average viewers&rsquo; minds with proper satire, which is the best weapon in the English language, the White Man&rsquo;s language to use any way he wants. </p>

		<p>Another thing Waters and Rangel have in common:  They both endorsed HRC for President over Obama at first.  Chicago-style thuggery payback, perhaps?</p>

		<p>Can you imagine if they investigated ALL the members of the Black Caucus? Look hard enough and you&rsquo;ll see that every one of them could be reasonably tried,found guilty  and dismissed! </p>

		<p>My best friend and I emitted war whoops of joy when we saw on TV that dear Maxine is indicted and will probably face a trial.  It was the best news either of us had heard since Rangel was indicted.  We&rsquo;ve been waiting YEARS for this blatantly racist witch to get her nasty hide nailed to the wall.  OF COURSE she - and Rangel - say they&rsquo;re innocent; Mark Twain wrote in &#8220;Tom Sawyer,&#8221; with Huck speaking, &#8220;Leastaways, I never see a (n-word) that WOULDN&rsquo;T lie!&#8221; - and that was describing the 1850&rsquo;s pre-war South; not one thing has changed 160 years later.  I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s any accident that blacks who gain power, be it in nation, state, county, city, or PTA, nearly always end up caught at pilfering funds and other improprieties.  The ones who don&rsquo;t seem to all have a lot of other-than-black blood&hellip;.    </p>
