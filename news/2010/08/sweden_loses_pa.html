			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Ward, Financial Times (London), August 18 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Six years after his brother was beheaded by Iraqi insurgents, Riyad is still haunted by the memory of identifying the disfigured body and watching the mutilation on a video distributed by the killers.</p>
<p>Yet Riyad now has fresh worries to contend with: the threat of deportation from Sweden, which recently rejected his application for asylum. &#8220;They murdered my brother and would have done the same to me,&#8221; he told an immigration official in a secretly recorded meeting broadcast on Radio Sweden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that,&#8221; replied the official. &#8220;But it doesn&rsquo;t count that they might do the same thing to you; you have to prove there is an actual threat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riyad, who worked with his brother on a US army base, was drawn to Sweden by its reputation as the most welcoming European country for Iraqi asylum-seekers, having absorbed tens of thousands in the past decade. In the past two years, however, numbers have dropped sharply as Sweden shows signs of losing patience with its role as champion of refugee rights.</p>
<p>In 2007, 18,559 Iraqis sought asylum in Sweden and nearly three-quarters were accepted. Last year the number arriving was 2,297  &mdash;  and less than a quarter were granted asylum.</p>
<p>The decline can be explained partly by better security in Iraq. But experts say the main factor was a Swedish court ruling in 2008 placing a greater burden on refugees to prove they were in danger.</p>
<p>Tobias Billström, Sweden&rsquo;s migration minister, insists there was no political involvement in the ruling, but the centre-right government has been quick to stress the court&rsquo;s message. &#8220;Now you have to show there is a real threat,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You cannot just turn up and say you&rsquo;re from Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tougher approach is welcomed by some Swedes, amid unease over the changing face of their traditionally homogenous society. More than a tenth of the population is now foreign-born, with Iraqis among the largest group.</p>
<p>Anti-immigration sentiment could make itself felt in next month&rsquo;s general election, with opinion polls suggesting the far-right Sweden Democrats could win their first seat in parliament.</p>
<p>Few places feel the tension more than Södertälje, an industrial town where 8,000 Iraqis live, many in high-rise ghettos. Anders Lago, the town&rsquo;s Social Democratic mayor, says the strain on public services is unsustainable. &#8220;We need a new system. Södertälje cannot take care of everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind Sweden&rsquo;s new approach lies frustration that other European Union states have not taken more refugees. Before the ruling, Sweden received about 60 per cent of Iraqi asylum applications in the EU.</p>
<p>If Stockholm is sending a message to other countries, critics say it has come at a heavy price for vulnerable refugees. It was among four European nations recently rebuked by the UNHCR for forcibly deporting asylum-seekers to Iraq despite the continuing violence.</p>
<p>Mikael Ribbenvik, director of legal affairs for the Swedish migration board, said his agency had issued new recommendations to take account of persecution of minorities in Iraq  &mdash;  a sign, perhaps, Sweden is anxious not to let its humanitarian halo slip too far. But this may be too late for Riyad, who says he would be at risk in Iraq not only because of his past ties to the US military, but also his Christian faith. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have to remain here,&#8221; he told Radio Sweden. &#8220;Just send me anywhere in the world  &mdash;  except Iraq.&#8221;<br>

		<p>In Iraq, Al Anbar province in late 07 an immensly popular sheik was killed by Al Qaeda and in the following days more than 200 known Al Qaeda were murdered and attacks against us dropped to near none! These Iraqis know who the murderers are, but will do nothing about them. The murdered sheik was one of the founding members of the Anbar awakening council against the Al Qaeda murderers and the rounding up and executions of the known al qaeda shows that the Iraqi people CAN do something about the murders and violence. So, because of what I know, I have no sympathy for those Iraqis that run away to welfare states, it is just an excuse. Near every home in Iraq has an AK-47 or an RPG and usuall all of the above so there is no reason for them to allow themselves to be kidnapped and executed by the al qaeda murderers.</p>

		<p>Sweden needs to close the door to all immigration, and in fact, should begin a program of repatriation of former asylum seekers.  It is of course noble of them to provide assistance to others, but to do so at the expense of destroying their own country is a crime against their own citizens.  As for Riyad, I agree with Bredan(post #1), send him to Syria or anywhere else in the Middle East. Just don&rsquo;t leave him in the West.</p>

		<p>Other than a relative handful of tourists, international businessmen, diplomats, and the like the only people in Sweden should be ethnic Swedes, other ethnic Scandinavians native to Swedish territory, Lapps/Samis, and that&rsquo;s IT.   Deport ALL OTHERS, especially, in order of priority, blacks, Muslims, other non-whites, non-Northern Europeans, and non-Scandinavians.</p>

		<p>I doubt Syria is going to start excepting more refugees from Europe. Estimates say they likely had a MILLION refugees as of 2007 and many are still there on expired visas. Syria is not a rich country, they can&rsquo;t be expected to shoulder so much of the burden when the war was NOT their fault.</p>

		<p>If any nation has a moral responsibility to take in Iraqi refugees, it would be the U.S.  After all, prior to the U.S. lead invasion, most minorities (including Christians and Jews) were safe in Iraq.  As far as I know, Sweden never invaded Iraq on any meaningful level so why should they take in Iraqi refugees?</p>

<p>In fact, the Christians of Syria are of the same sect and ethnic group (Assyrians of the Syriac Othodox Church) as the Christians of Iraq, s it seems a good fit. Personally I have lofty dreams of Christian insurgents taking over both Syria and Iraq, and ruling as a minority government, but I can&rsquo;t see that happening, realistically.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a piddly amount compared to how many &#8220;refugees&#8221; and other undesirables that the U.S. accepts every year, even if you consider the total population of the U.S. vs. Sweden.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad that Sweden is at least taking a tougher stand on an issue such as this.</p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s about time the Swedes got compassion fatigue. They&rsquo;ve played the sucker nation for decades. The bogus asylum seekers have turned some Swedish cities into virtual No-Go zones. Sweden was a richer culturally country before the current diversity driven immigration. </p>

<p><br>
That  sentence sums it up beautifully and in a nutshell. It may be a fine and noble thing to assist others, but at some point we have to consider our own  interests and decide  <i>where our priorities lie.</i>  Who comes first&hellip;we or them?  Our own people, families, nations &hellip; or others?  And to what degree?   &mdash;    should we help others at the cost of damaging outselves? </p>
<p>(And yes, though Marxists would refuse to recognize anything touching on genetics, diluting one&rsquo;s national identity or gene pool is damaging oneself.  Indeed, for very small countries such as Sweden or Denmark, importing the hordes of the overpopulated Third World, and giving them a foothold,  amounts to nothing less than national suicide.)</p>
<p>While it is true that we are all members of the human family and, in a sense, &#8216;citizens of the world&rsquo; , national governments exist to serve the interests and well being of THEIR OWN CITIZENS who <i>ELECTED </i> them   &mdash;   not the interests of the entire world.   These governments sometimes get big-headed and  need to be reminded whom they represent!</p>
<p>This is a lesson that badly needs to be learned by the United States as well as Sweden. Canada too!  In fact, the  faddish current notion that we have pan-human governments responsible to the whole world seems to have infected virtually all of the more prosperous white countries.  I said &#8220;white countries&#8221;.</p>
<p>(But NOT the non-white countries!   China, Mexico, India,  the Arab countries, etc.   &mdash;  - no matter how much money they have   &mdash;   are burdened by no such  delusions that their governments exist to serve all humanity, nor that  their taxes should be spent to uplift others.)  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a nice first step, but too little and too late.  The Swedes will have to go a lot further make their country what it once was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic, of course, that Sweden, once in the forefront of self-righteous European nations that took the US to task for its &#8220;racism,&#8221; is now beginning to achieve enlightenment.  Pity that the lesson had to be so hard-learned.</p>

<p>Nope. The USA has NO &#8220;moral&#8221; obligation to take in any 3rd worlder, period  (in fact it is UNconstitutional to allow any nonwhite immigration) Much less to any White Euro nation! </p>
<p>WE, the people, did not start any war! It was the enemies within our government that starts all our wars. Maybe as an excuse to kill off our best and replace them with these &#8220;refugees&#8221; and immigrants?  Ever thought about that? Population replacement is the agenda.</p>

<p>No it is not a piddly amount compared to you. Sodertalje has taken in more iraqi refugees than all of USA.</p>
<p>And Iraqis aren&rsquo;t even the biggest group, Somalis is the fastest growing one (and those are even worse).</p>
<p>A large part of the problem is that 95% of those that come to Sweden have no identification of any kind, usually because they have thrown them away. This makes identifying them very hard and gullible Swedish social workers goes on what they say.</p>
<p>Many are far older than they claim (being under 18 makes it easier for you to get asylum) and many are from parts of Iraq that are calm.</p>
<p>Many aren&rsquo;t even from the country they claim to be fleeing from.</p>
<p>And what is really telling is that a lot of these people who has had to flee from the country, actually take semester vacations back in their home country as soon as they have a Swedish citizenship.</p>
<p>As for him being christian, maybe he is, maybe he is a recent convert, a fairly new trick where they claim they are convert and are therefore under a Islamic death sentence since converting from Islam is forbidden.</p>
<p>But the reason can easily be found under &#8220;taqqiya&#8221;.</p>
<p>The majority of Sweden population doesn&rsquo;t want this, in a farily regular census, the two choices &#8220;no immigration at all&#8221; and &#8220;less immigration&#8221; have gotten over 50% every time, the other choices being &#8220;same immigration policy as now&#8221; and &#8220;free immigration&#8221;.</p>
<p>The ones that are positive to immigration is the media and political elite.<br>
We have 7 political parties in parliament in Sweden. All 7 of them claim to be feminist and pro-immigration&hellip;.</p>
<p>There is just no other choice to vote for (except a new party, which for quite simple reason are going to get into parliament this year with a bang, rising from 1.2% in 2002, 3.1% 2006 and a all census shows to them getting between 4.5-6% this year.</p>
<p>Their only real question? Immigration, and a stop to it.<br>

<p>Remarkable. The media and the political elite!  Isn&rsquo;t that stunningly similar to the situation in the USA?  And Canada. And Australia. And Britain, and France, etc., etc.</p>
<p>In ALL of these supposedly representative democracies, the governments are totally out of kilter with the wishes of the people. There are certain pet topics that are placed  above and beyond debate. Immigration is one.  As in dealing with children, you&rsquo;re going to have it whether you like it or not. They know what&rsquo;s good for you. So shut up and swallow your medicine!  </p>
<p>Government &#8220;of the people&#8221; is really government <i>versus</i>  the people!</p>

		<p>Given the national rape and female mutilation rates in Sweden, Denmark and Norway as well as the overwhelming racial identities of the attackers; it&rsquo;s impossible to be &#8216;feminist&rsquo; -and- &#8216;pro immigration&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
According to a new study from the Crime Prevention Council, Brå, it is four times more likely that a known rapist is born abroad, compared to persons born in Sweden. Resident aliens from Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia dominate the group of rape suspects. According to these statistics, almost half of all perpetrators are immigrants. In Norway and Denmark, we know that non-Western immigrants, which frequently means Muslims, are grossly overrepresented on rape statistics. In Oslo, Norway, immigrants were involved two out of three rape charges in 2001. The numbers in Denmark were the same, and even higher in the city of Copenhagen with three out of four rape charges. Sweden has a larger immigrant, including Muslim, population than any other country in northern Europe. The numbers there are likely to be at least as bad as with its Scandinavian neighbors. The actual number is thus probably even higher than what the authorities are reporting now, as it doesn&rsquo;t include second generation immigrants. Lawyer Ann Christine Hjelm, who has investigated violent crimes in Svea high court, found that 85 per cent of the convicted rapists were born on foreign soil or by foreign parents.<br>

At this point 2 out of every 3 new Swedes is from a non-ethnically-Swedish ancestry.<br>

<p>&gt;<br>
According to the United Nations Sixth Annual Survey on Crime, crime recorded in police statistics shows the crime rate for the combined total of all Index crimes in Sweden to be 6981.48, per 100,000 inhabitants in 1997. This compares with 1345.94 for Japan (country with a low crime rate) and 4930.06 for USA (country with high crime rate).<br>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t understand the logic behind flying in a bunch of poor people from a foreign country, housing them in ghettos, putting them on public assistance while they produce children as fast as possible to be the next generation&rsquo;s gang problem and then declaring a moral victory. Where&rsquo;s the moral victory?</p>

		<p>Sweden and other Scandinavian countries used to judge us here in the USA accusing us of &#8220;racism&#8221; and while claiming to be so less racist. Europeans were naive in the past as they had never lived around other races. Now sadly, they are learning the hard way about what it&rsquo;s really like to live around many of other races, something we Americans knew long ago!!!!</p>
