<h1><a href="https://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/immigration/mexican-drug-cartel-sheriff-arpaio-07292010">Mexican Drug Cartel Allegedly Puts a Price on Arizona Sheriff&rsquo;s Head</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KUTP-TV (Phoenix), August 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the day parts of Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law, SB 1070, went into effect, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is in the news for another reason: there&rsquo;s a price on his head  &mdash;  allegedly offered by a Mexican drug cartel.</p>
<p>The audio message in Spanish is a bit garbled, but the text is clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s offering a million dollars for Sheriff Joe Arpaio&rsquo;s head and offering a thousand dollars for anyone who wants to join the Mexican cartel.&#8221;</p>
<p>A man who wants to remain anonymous says his wife received the text message Tuesday evening. It also included an international phone number and instructions to pass the message along.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s office says investigators are trying to trace exactly where the text message came from, but because it did originate from an international number, that will be difficult too.<br>

		<p>If it&rsquo;s a genuine bounty, then I think this is pretty much proof that the Mexican drug gangs are funding the noise machine and street rabble against Arizona and SB 1070.  </p>
<p>However, there is an old saying that flashers don&rsquo;t rape.  IOW, it&rsquo;s the quiet ones you have to worry about.  Those that send death threats are probably the least likely people to commit murder.</p>

		<p>Obama had better hope nothing happens to sheriff Joe. I would cause a backlash against immigrants and the obama administration that would dwarf 9-11. Whites would have a Martyr that would make MLK look like a nobody. Believe me Hispanics should be just as outraged. They came to america to escape the kind of non-sense that is endemic in mexico.</p>

		<p>Mexican Drug cartels and President Obama are on the same side in this argument.  They both want open borders and they both want Sheriff Joe Arpaio gone.</p>
<p>In the past, USA Presidents have usually advocated for America and for American citizens.  President Obama is a different kind of President.  He takes the side of the Mexican drug cartels.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really leery of this report. However, selling drugs to our children is a lucrative business, which is why they&rsquo;re fighting for control of that trade south of the border. This particular report probably should be taken with a dose of skepticism, however it would seem logical that one day the cartels would move from getting rid of those in Mexico who stand in their way, to targeting those in the United States who get in the way of pushing drugs here. <br>

<p>From a chain email:</p>
<p>A letter to Europeans and those of the European Diaspora; in other words, a letter to all white people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear White Man,</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that your kind has been slated for termination. We, the various Third World majorities of Africa, Asia, India, South America, and the Middle East assert that your long history of success at building civilizations, developing new technologies, creating stable governments, fostering good will, feeding much of the world, and increasing peace and prosperity even amongst the riotous hordes of our own homelands, has made us envious and resentful of you. We, who make up 92% of the global population, feel that we can no longer accept the great disparity between your success and our abject failure. The solution to this inequality should be obvious to all concerned.</p>
<p>We are planning to invade your ancestral homelands, little by little, and to facilitate this, we have the full cooperation of your controlled media and government, academia, and law enforcement organizations. While we, personally, do not control any of these entities ourselves, we are profiting endlessly from the crypto-Marxist system put in place many decades ago by an ethnic fifth column which operates with complete impunity at all levels of your political, academic, and media culture. Their interference in the natural development of your constitutional republics has been indispensable to our efforts to wrest from you the control of everything that you&rsquo;ve struggled to build and maintain over the last century. Indeed, were it not for them, none of our present plans would have even been possible.</p>
<p>By carefully controlling and managing the schools, universities, media, and press, this out group has managed to convince the great bulk of your racial kinsmen that not only is resistance futile, but that it is immoral, barbaric, depraved, and unworthy of a thinking individual. By promoting the stereotype of a racist redneck resistance, they have made the idea of a struggle for white identity a veritable sin in the minds of nearly every white person. In short: they have convinced European-derived peoples that a prolonged suicide is preferable to the unmitigated evil of racism.</p>
<p>Vergil, Mozart, Shakespeare, and all other bourgeois manifestations of your high culture will be vanquished forever. All of your legends and heroes will be spat upon, purged, and finally forgotten. Your cultural folkways will be transgressions; your identity will become a crime.</p>
<p><br>
We come for your JOBS, your MONEY, your WOMEN, and eventually your LIVES. It will not be much longer now.  What is yours will be ours.</p>
<p><br>
Signed,</p>
<p>Non-Whites Around the World<br>

		<p>From Post # 6:  &#8220;President Obama is a different kind of President. He takes the side of the Mexican drug cartels.&#8221;</p>
<p>True.  Obama warned us that he would bring &#8220;change&#8221; to America, and he certainly did.  Just like &#8220;Diversity,&#8221; Obama brings &#8220;new ideas to the table,&#8221; and shows us &#8220;new ways of doing things.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Being on the same side as the Mexican drug cartels is certainly a &#8220;new way to do things&#8221; for a USA President.</p>

		<p>Threats like this should never be taken lightly. The Mexicans and the Obamination better watch out, if anything happens to Sheriff Arpaio, he will be a martyr and there will be a violent backlash that will result in whites hunting down and killing Mexicans. Drug cartels are going to cause a violent revolution in the U.S., with lots of Robespierres emerging that will begin to mete out the executions these terrorists deserve. A lot of innocent people will also be killed all around in the violence too, something that&rsquo;s just fine with Mexican drug gangs and our government too.</p>

		<p>Murder, rape, kidnapping and theft are accepted social and cultural norms in Hispanic countries.  </p>
<p>The per-capita murder rate in Mexico is over three times that of the United States.  </p>
<p>This speaks volumes about the moral character of the Mexican.  </p>
<p>Hispanics from other Latin American countries are little better&hellip;<br>

		<p> Certainly, there would be few tears in Washington if something unfortunate happened to Joe Arpaio. Sheriff Arpaio better represents the attitudes of most white Americans toward immigration than any vacillating, vote-seeking, minority-pleasing, DC politician. I fully support and encourage this courageous, old West, no nonsense, American hero: Sheriff Joseph Arpaio.</p>

		<p>Like Al Queda, the Mexican drug cartell couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a threat to Joe Arpaio&rsquo;s life-and Native Born White Americans in general- if there wasn&rsquo;t a base of support for the cartel&rsquo;s in America which there surely is. And that base of support is in the Hispanic community. If the 1965 Immigration Reform Act had not been passed, the Hispanic population in America would be very small, and as a consequence, it would have been impossible for the Mexican drug cartels to get a foothold in America. In fact, if the 1965 Immigration Reform Act had not been passed and if American had mantained it&rsquo;s national origins immigration policy, Joe Arpaio would not have his life threatened and 9/11 would never have occured.</p>
<p>Treason is the the Reason.</p>

		<p>In 1973, some racist Mexicans shot and killed a police cheif in Newark, CA.That really angered me. If anything happens to Sheriff Arpaio, the backlash will be a lot larger than the one caused by the killing of the rancher in Arizona,and amnasty and &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; immigration &#8220;reform&#8221; will have no chance of happening.I dont want anything to happen to Sheriff Arpaio.</p>

<p>I would be shocked if this hasn&rsquo;t already happened to a some extent especially bribed borderpatrol agents, local cops in border regions etc. although our country has been so heavily colonized by Mexican invaders that there large pool of Mexicans to recruit here already so why take the risk of recruiting anglos?</p>
<p>Much like the Scilian Mafia, I assume you want to recruit people with family in Mexico so the Cartel can wipe out the person&rsquo;s family if they betray them. A gringo would probably just run to the FBI.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a sad commentary when a functional illiterate can spend a million dollars. There is hardly one word in that text that is correctly spelled. When gangsters begin handing down death sentences on OUR law enforcement officials we know that our enemies are confident that they will destroy us.<br>
How much more proof do we need that we are being assailed from all sides with the unspoken approval of what we may jokingly call our government. It&rsquo;s a laundry list of the tools of our destruction:<br>
1.Millions of illegals have been allowed to cross the border; many of whom are neither Mexican nor Central American but rather Arabs, Paks and other Muslims who may be terrorist operatives.<br>
2. Tens of thousands of White people are being brutalized in various ways every day by the large criminal element in our Black population which has become more violent everyday proportionately to the ever increasing subsidies that they  receive. In addition, they publicly advocate violence and infanticide against White people with impunity.<br>
I saw some old news film of speeches by George Lincoln Rockwell who despite his rantings never advocated murder of Blacks.</p>
<p>3. We&rsquo;re making nice with brutal dicatorships who want us dead. We&rsquo;ve sent our manufacturing to China whose leaders cheered while watching the September 11 Muslim attacks.<br>
Was it Lenin who said, &#8220;The that we hang the Capitalists, they will sell us the rope&#8221;?<br>
4. Our armed services are heavily infiltrated by Black and Hispanic gang bangers who are getting sohisticated weapons training to be used back in &#8221; the world&#8221; We never wanted to believe that our American troops would kill us but when they are mostly non-Whites, that guarantee is at risk.</p>
<p><br>
The survival of this nation has never been more at risk than it is today. I&rsquo;m convinced that an massive emergency/crisis will be created thereby giving the &#8220;Government&#8221; total dictatorial authority.</p>
