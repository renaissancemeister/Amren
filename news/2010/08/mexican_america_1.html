		<p>google rapto/washingtonpost/pulitzer  In 2002, the Washington Post&rsquo;s Mary Jordan won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the lovely Mexican practice of raping 12 year old girls as a part of their proud tradition.  Somehow I doubt it will be part of this program.</p>

		<p>If you were to replace &#8220;Latino&#8221; and &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; in the above passage with &#8220;European American,&#8221; and then attempted to advertise for a 4-d conference, you would be called a hateful racist, and would probably lose your job.  </p>

		<p>As an English instructor at a college in Tucson, Arizona, I am concerned about some missing criteria:</p>
<p>*The ability of the student to think critically</p>
<p>*The ability of the student to read and comprehend complex texts(Chemistry, Philosophy, Biology) in English</p>
<p>*The ability of the student to write in grammatically proper and comprehensible and articulate English.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t send missions to the Moon and Mars because American students took courses on boosting their self-esteem. Americans must get back to the 3 R&rsquo;s. If those slacking on the fringes of this Great Nation&rsquo;s economy can&rsquo;t do at least that much, &#8220;dynamic and confident leadership in the 21st century [ha ha ha]&#8221; is out of the question. </p>
<p>Assimilate! And master the basics of education. Or shut up and grab a broom.</p>

		<p>Only a group with a pathetic history and no contributions to any field of human endeavor would conceive of these happy talk conferences.  The best that could happen to a Mexican student is that he/she does feel ashamed of their culture and vow to assimilate and be as American as possible.  The cultural baggage that &#8220;Chicanos&#8221; bring gets them nowhere except maybe teaching Chicano studies. I stopped getting upset at things like this, now I really pity these misplaced and misguided fools.  </p>

		<p>I think all Mexican kids should go to these classes and learn this nonsense. </p>
<p>Black kids can go to similar &#8220;self esteem&#8221; classes where they learn that blacks built the pyramids and a brilliant black scientist named Yakub created us white devils 6600 years ago.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all great. Maybe then white kids can study actual informtion without being &#8220;enriched&#8221; by all that diversity. </p>

		<p>Does anybody remember a little thing called the Mexican-American War of the late 1840s where  50,000 American troops were killed by the Mexican invaders?<br/>
PC revisionists craftily try to forget this war not only because it involved Mexicans but also because the war was won mainly because of great military leaders like Robert E Lee and Jefferson Davis who were both top ranked US Military Academy graduates at West Point who of course are taboo in American history since they led the struggle for states rights in the Lincoln Marxist War.</p>
<p>Lets not forget Lincoln who briefly enlisted in the Mexican-American War but deserted his post in a few days and was discharged as a deserter and immediately got into politics. Oddly enough Marx published his Manifesto in 1848 and the GOP was born in 1854 with Lincoln being their first presidential candidate in 1860 watched very carefully by a wary South Carolina who knew all about him and his Manifesto beliefs. </p>
<p>We know what happened afterwards with Lincoln being rigged in office and immediately SC seceeded legally in DC and in Columbia as the serpent King Abe devised a devious plot to force an attack on the north sending soldiers to Ft Sumter in world famous Charleston Harbor that was fied on but noone hurt but giving him the ammo he needed to ammass his 2 million man army to teach them a lesson even though the south was paying 60% in taxations to the northern industrialists.</p>

		<p>Maybe they can boost their self-esteem by considering the career of this mexican-american astronaut, whose great claim to fame is that he hitched a ride on a spacecraft designed and built by white guys:</p>

<p>Do you have a source for this? I can&rsquo;t find anything on it and would love to have it.</p>

		<p>Great; let the Mexican kids study political reconquista &#8220;fluff&#8221; in classes led by professional agitators, while white kids study mathematics, English and science.  A generation later, who does anyone think will be the lawyers, accountants, doctors and engineers, and who will STILL be the janitors, maids and vegetable-pickers?</p>
<p>My only serious objection is that the state (i.e. the taxpaying public) is expected to pay these reconquista apparatchik &#8220;teachers&#8221; with money that was appropriated for education, rather than political indoctrination into a cult of victimhood.<br/>
