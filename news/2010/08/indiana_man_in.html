			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Smoking Gun, August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Indiana man was arrested last night after cops spotted him with his pants &#8220;pulled down to his knees&#8221; and his boxer shorts exposed.</p>
<p>Demetrius Russ, 21, was sitting on top of an electrical box talking on his phone when approached by cop Daniel Green. According to an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department report, after Russ ignored Green&rsquo;s repeated requests to provide ID, he announced, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t ask me for shit.&#8221; Green reported telling Russ that he was &#8220;sitting on private property with his pants pulled down on top of an electrical box.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Green asked why his pants were so droopy, Russ noted that he &#8220;was just swagging.&#8221; The officer replied that, &#8220;swagging did not involve exposing your genitals through your boxers because your pants were pulled down all the way.&#8221; The term &#8220;swagging&#8221; generally refers to getting your drink on.</p>
<p>During his interaction with Green, a &#8220;belligerent&#8221; Russ allegedly cursed frequently and called the cop &#8220;nigga and muthafucker on several occasions.&#8221; While police contended that Russ appeared drunk, he claimed to have only consumed &#8220;one 40 ounce.&#8221;</p>

		<p>While the repulsive Demetrius would never be my acquaintance, he actually has a right to be a disgusting fool. </p>
<p>The nanny state should have better things to do, like shooting murderers and rapists,some of whom Demetrius may well be compadres with. Nevertheless, his decision to be a fool should not be a concern of the authorities. </p>
<p>Demetrius will never understand why he is disgusting. But disgusting is not a criminal offense.</p>

 And the term &#8220;getting your drink on&#8221; means?!? <br>
&#8220;consumed one forty ounce&#8221;<br>
 Reminds me of my buddy who once worked physical plant services for a major South Texas school district. They had a Friday celebratory meal that was sure to bring the weekend on early.  It was two quarts of beer followed by a bowl of menudo. I believe they called it &#8220;The Hydraulic Lunch&#8221;. Made for the perfect afternoon nap in the work van underneath a pecan tree out by the cinder track.</p>

		<p> I drove a school bus for a while. One morning while picking up high school students in a predominantly black neighborhood; a young black man with his pants down over his buttocks, walked up to the steps and could not raise his feet high enough to get on the bus. He then proceeded to grab the rail, lean to one side in order to get his foot high enough and fell flat on the side of his face.<br>
 A well dressed and normally well articulated young black man told him to &#8220;pull up your f###ing pants and get your ass on the bus&#8221;.<br>
 This story confirms &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221; statement.<br>
PS The entire bus laughed about it for the rest of the route.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m with poster #1 on this one.  Let them do the most outlandish and foolish things as they please.  </p>
<p>It differentiates them from us and makes it easier to know so many things, for example:</p>
<p>1) Say you&rsquo;re interested in moving to a new area.  You notice a man walking by on the street with his pants down.  This lets you know to choose another area.</p>
<p>2)  You are walking alone at night in an urban area and you see some men with pants down.  You turn and walk away as fast as you can.  If they try to chase you, you can easily outrun them!</p>
<p>3)  A job applicant comes in.  You know you have to hire some non-whites to satisfy affirmative action, so you are on the lookout for the smarter whites who have good manners, etc.  A guy swaggers in with gold teeth and -pants down.  You pass on his application.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>

		<p>The original article has a direct link to the Google Street View of Mr. Russ&rsquo;s particular hangout where he likes to wear his pants rather low.  And it should be no surprise   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s a cracker jack box apartment complex.  I&rsquo;m guessing Section 8.  Or maybe it&rsquo;s Indianapolis Housing Authority-owned.  Either way, it&rsquo;s behind a Kroger   &mdash;   I feel sorry for that particular Kroger.</p>

		<p>To all the &#8220;pants down&#8221; apologists.  It&rsquo;s not tolerated because it is indecent exposure.<br>
Plain and simple.  Moreover, when their pants are in that state and they are just &#8220;hanging out&#8221; watch what they do when a woman or girl walks by - especially a white girl.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with you.  The conditioning that we - all of us - are getting, conditions Whites to behave, dress, sound and look like Blacks.  Blacks aren&rsquo;t the only ones dressing and acting this way.  Stop fantasizing.  We&rsquo;re not out-running them.  They&rsquo;ve caught up to us and have past us - Not in the achievement sense - but in the advancement sense.  Unqualified Blacks are getting jobs over more qualified Whites everywhere.  Dolts like this character actually get jobs over far better qualified Whites.  </p>

		<p>   It&rsquo;s too bad that he did such a stupid thing.  He&rsquo;s a prime example of how our over-tolerant culture allows this stuff to occur. I bet his mom is a welfare mother and he doesn&rsquo;t have an involved dad. It&rsquo;s sad that someone from a church or club didn&rsquo;t intervene and help him find a purpose for living. He&rsquo;s a good-looking kid that in another reality might&rsquo;ve been able to make something of himself. Let&rsquo;s hope he changes his ways.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHA &#8220;getting your drink on means??&#8221; I don&rsquo;t recognize ghetto/black slang either, nor do I respond to it in my professional day to day work either, the  blacks I am forced to work with here in Afghanistan speak ENGLISH to me or I do not respond. Unusually, the better black English speakers I work with here in Afghanistan are from Kenya!</p>

<p>I fail to see what was illegal about &#8220;exposing&#8221; one&rsquo;s underwear.<br>
Nor do I see that he was doing anything illegal in just sitting there talking on the phone. Where&rsquo;s the crime?  Being a big fool is everyone&rsquo;s privilege, but it&rsquo;s not illegal. That cop needs to have a re-training course, or find something better to do. </p>
<p>I agree with all the other posters above that this was a nonsense case.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I often marvel at what holds those pants up.  Suspenders?  Safety pins?  Sheer luck?</p>

		<p>Blacks go to every conceivable extreme to set themselves apart by looking and talking ridiculous and then they whine about not being accepted by mainstream whites.</p>
<p>This is clearly a sign of a limited intelligence aggravated by a total lack of common sense.</p>
<p>What would the local reaction be if these American blacks walked around a black African nation with their pants around their knees?<br>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more Mr Question. Makes them easier to spot out there in &#8216;general-public-land&rsquo; and you even hear the odd funny story about them falling on their behinds whilst fleeing from &#8216;the man&rsquo; or even falling of a flight of stairs and getting their little a**es hurt!</p>

<p>I agree again. The &#8216;state&rsquo; spends too much time policing the habits of no-account fools&hellip;let them fall down and make a mess of themselves! The state should also stop cleaning up the mess these people create (unless they want to put them in a cage in the middle of nowhere&hellip;) and look out for the real people.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;s an offensive waste of oxygen, but that&rsquo;s not illegal. If he gets arrested and incarcerated, he&rsquo;ll act like a down-trodden fool, convert to islam, get the appropriate tattoos and blame it all on the system.</p>

<p>I would like to request that Amren stop publishing cowardly, know it all libertarian non sense. Libertarians always push the idea that everyone in the world should be free to whatever they want to do and all the problems in our country/the world are caused by too much government, too much regulation etc.</p>
<p>Those of us who have lived in urban America and been around the likes of Demetrius Russ, Mike Tyson, the Bloods, the Carr Brothers or just any of the millions of hostile, disrespectful Blacks, NWs in the USA know from painful experience that Whites can not let low life Blacks/NWS:</p>
<p>Do whatever they want to do.</p>
<p>Whites can not allow low life Blacks to expose their private parts to us - particularly to our women.</p>
<p>Whites can not allow low life Blacks/NWs to insult, threaten White police officers/or any police officers, teachers, religious leaders or just the general public.</p>
<p>This is how White Civilization breaks down.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be a coward and in particular, don&rsquo;t be a cowardly/idiot Libertarian.</p>
<p>When you see the likes of Demetrius Russ doing TNB, take a firm, no nonsense position. Support any White or any person who has the courage to take physical action to make the low life Blacks/NW stop doing what they want to do.</p>

<p>Originally, yes, that was the purpose of &#8220;low-riding&#8221; - as it is called in my very ghetto town. But now, a lot of young black men do it just because they think it looks cool, which of course it doesn&rsquo;t. At all.</p>

		<p>I totally agree with Question Diversity.  I&rsquo;ve watched COPS and seen a number of &#8220;youths&#8221; run from the cops only to be tripped up by their saggy drawers.  I have to admit it&rsquo;s a bit entertaining.</p>

		<p>I think this means trolling for gay sex, but one of my black liberal colleagues says that this fashion statement comes from a time when blacks were too poor to buy clothes for all members of the family, so the sons took to wearing the father&rsquo;s pants. She actually believed this, and told this to a liberal white colleague who fell for this hook, line, and sinker. <br>
What fathers? Where? There&rsquo;s plenty of money for $150.00 tennis shoes. <br>
Also, it&rsquo;s really funny to watch two guys with pants below their butt-cheeks get into a fight. One hand is swinging and the other is around the crotch area holding the pants up. Pure comedy gold.</p>

		<p>The three theories I&rsquo;ve heard about the genesis of the saggy pants nicety, all three relating to prisons, and two of the three relate to sex:</p>
<p>1.  When one is booked into a jail or prison, one&rsquo;s belt is confiscated, and one&rsquo;s institution-issued clothes does not have a belt-like device, in order to prevent suicides.  Therefore, one&rsquo;s pants would sag anyway, and sagging is seen as a mode of sympathy with a loved one in prison.</p>
<p>2.  A prison inmate who sags his pants is advertising himself as available.</p>
<p>3.  Similar to #2, but he is advertising himself as part of a powerful prison gang, and is therefore daring a fellow inmate to rape him.</p>
