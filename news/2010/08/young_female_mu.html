			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Baltimore Sun, August 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 14-year-old girl charged with fatally shooting a man during a robbery attempt earlier this month fired her gun when one of the victims laughed at her because she was so young, according to police charging documents filed this morning.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, in seeking the young suspect be held without bail, described Arteesha Holt in court papers as a &#8220;flight risk and a danger to the citizens of Baltimore.&#8221; The young girl is charged with first-degree murder, armed robbery, using a handgun in the commission of a violent crime and several other offenses.</p>
<p>Police have said the girl may have tried to rob two men on Linwood Avenue on Aug. 13 as part of a gang initiation. The victims were among three Latino men killed in recent weeks in a spate of crimes that has shaken the community in Southeast Baltimore.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bonilla [Wilmer Bonilla, a witness] told police, according to the charging documents, that he and Gonzalez were sitting on the steps when a young girl armed with a silver handgun approached and announced a robbery. &#8220;Because of the age of the suspect the victims began to laugh at which time the suspect fired one shot grazing the victim Wilmer Bonilla&rsquo;s head and striking Jose Coreas in the center of his forehead.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said they identified Holt as a suspect because she had told several friends and bystanders about her involvement and that her 18-year-old brother had helped her escape from the neighborhood. But she gave the gun to her brother, according to police, and he kept the .32 caliber revolver in a black bag.</p>
<p>Police said the brother showed the gun to people and later was seen by police officers carrying the bag. Officer stopped the brother and arrested him on a handgun violation. They said investigators later linked the gun to the shooting.</p>

		<p>At first I assumed this was about the 14 and 17 yr. olds in Philadelphia who shot an 98 year old white man who was cutting his grass, because they felt &#8220;dissed&#8221; by him. He probably also thought it was a joke.   (After all, how many 14-year-old killers do you have, right?)</p>
<p>But no!   THIS one was about ANOTHER 14-year old killer, this one in Baltimore. They are happening all over the place.</p>
<p>This is what our welfare dollars have been buying us   &mdash;   we are feeding young killers to murder us in our old age.</p>

<p>I can hardly imagine a crime of ANY sort nor even a crime WAVE causing the criminals in B-more to be &#8220;shaken&#8221; it is business as usual as I recall B-more.</p>

<p>First, he kept a firearm he knew to be used in a murder. It&rsquo;s called oxy/acetylene torch. Learn it, live it, love it. Second, he decided to play show-and-tell with it to all his friends. What? &#8220;look, dawg, this is the gun my sister used to pop that foo&#8221;   &mdash;  like that? Third, he was carrying it around with him everywhere like some kind of personal totem.  dollars to doughnuts that he would do something stupid and draw the attention of police officers anyway - why would he immediately add firearm-violation to the offenses??   </p>

		<p>And it&rsquo;s not just gang initiation like the liberal media tries to feed us and point our attention away from certain truths. When you are born to and raised by drug addicts, alcoholics, criminals and others of low moral character, this is some of the results. Also, if mommy does drugs or drink while the little darlings are in utero, quite often they&rsquo;ll be born mentally defective. Oh, how politically incorrect of me!</p>

		<p>I remember speaking with a black man in his early thirties some 20 years ago about how he and the other black people I was dealing with seemed very personable. Having been pre-warned of the environment I would be operating in, I was apprehensive of the possible situations that might arise. During this conversation the black man told me it was not people like him that one needed to be worried about. It was the five-year olds that would gun down a person without a moment&rsquo;s notice. </p>

		<p>I enjoyed reading the comment about the &#8220;NRA fools&#8221; that belong behind bars with this cockroach. I&rsquo;m a member of the NRA and I would like to point out that in Baltimore it&rsquo;s pretty hard to carry a gun legally. It&rsquo; not permitted to own or carry a .32 revolver unless you&rsquo;re 21 or older, You cannot purchase ammunition for a handgun unless you are that age or older. And unless I woke up in the wrong place today, murder is a crime in Baltimore. I presume that the comment was directed at the &#8221; easy availability of guns &#8220;. If that cockroach would murder someone for such a trivial reason, why would that cockroach obey the laws that prohibit handgun possesion? This type of comment usually comes from an ignorant idiot that perhaps some day will need a gun but won&rsquo;t have it. I have never been, and never will be in that situation. Remember, guns don&rsquo;t kill people, bullits kill people. Like my Dad always used to say ( and he shot a robber that threatened his life with a shotgun ) &#8221; a gun is not that heavy, not that hard to carry, but if you need one and you don&rsquo;t have it, boy will you miss it&#8221;.</p>

		<p>To #5, the N.R.A. is not at fault here. The liberal do gooders that think the inner city hoods and thugs are people deserving more are. In every city and state that has a carry law, the crime rate has gone down. The highest crime rates are in the most gun restricted areas which happen to be the most heavily black and Hispanic.</p>

<p>While I was riding the city bus where I live, around the time of the 1991? LA riots, some black folks were on the bus talking amongst themselves claiming all the rioting must be being done by young kids, teenagers. To tell you the truth, though, in my experience you have to be afraid of all of them. </p>

		<p>This type of crime is occuring more often. They just keep getting younger and younger. More than likely older (over 18)siblings or friends are putting them up to this, since they will most likely face a liberal judge who will go easy on them. Where the protestors demanding &#8220;no justice, no peace&#8221;? Won&rsquo;t happen, that requires blacks to take a hard look at themselves. Something that is hard to do when nothing is ever your fault and everyone is out to bring you down. How can they even look in the mirror in the morning?</p>

		<p>I agree. I was mostly trying to let people know that the violence starts at a much earlier age than one might suspect. When I was 12 a black kid who was also 12 (and over six feet tall) told me he would kill me if he ever saw me in the city park again. I believed him. He murdered a store owner at the age of 16. Just the other day a 78-year old white man in poor health told me of an incident he witnessed while riding a city bus. He saw an old black man using a cane to savagely beat an old Hispanic man in a wheelchair. The blacks on the bus did nothing to intervene. I don&rsquo;t trust any of them.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t buy their disclaimers of responsibility. They act like these criminal kids are just dropping out of the sky from out of nowhere.  Nonsense!   These are the parents and grandparents of these unruly kids. Who produced these kids?  Who raised them?</p>
<p>These are the older generation. These are the people who should be role models.  If they&rsquo;re not responsible for their own younger generation, then who is?  Where did these wild kids come from?<br>

		<p>I would without any compunction shoot and kill a 14-year old threatening me with a gun, female or not. A 14-year-old threatening people with a gun is no child, she is a deadly threat to innocent people that must be eliminated or neutralized, even if that leads to the death of that person at the hands of law-enforcement or a would be victims. Bullets do not care who fired them at whom for what reason.</p>

		<p>Baltimore, Baltimore, Former capital of white blue collar life and sports. The Colts. Unitas. Artie Donovan. National Boh and Polish and German ethnics. You could walk the poorest white neighborhood in peace. </p>
<p>But here we go again in the black hell of Baltimore.</p>
<p>And the good black and mostly white liberal folk of Maryland will reelect this November the marshmellow governor, Martin O&rsquo;malley, former Baltimore mayor, favorite of Pres Hussein and dedicated opponent of the death penalty. He doesn&rsquo;t even want to build more jails. Just dump billions more into worthless schools in black dominated Baltimore and Prince Georges County. </p>
<p>And billions into the PC soaked University of Maryland system that has a two tier system: rigid standards for whites that has drastically driven down white enrollment and relaxed standards for blacks who are victims of what? The public schools that O&rsquo;Malley and his black allies created and nurture that are soft on crime and soft on tough academic standards.</p>
<p>This 14 year old is not such an atypical student in Maryland schools in and about Baltimore and DC. As for the still white rural areas in the west and Eastern Shore, O&rsquo;malley &amp; his crew don&rsquo;t need them, and they get nothing.</p>
