			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patricia Emenpour, Flint Journal, August 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Neighbors of a house that appears to belong to the suspected serial stabber  &mdash;   who was earlier identified as Elias Abuelazam  &mdash;  say the man moved into his home a month to a month and a half ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a little bit scary knowing that I was two houses down from a possible serial stabber,&#8221; said Taylor Strang, 20, of Flint.</p>
<p>Her mother, Carrie Strang, 43, said she had seen a green blazer in the driveway, one that fit the police description of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Carrie Strang, who woke up this morning to find state police cars outside, said she didn&rsquo;t contact authorities because he was a dark Middle Eastern man and the description said he was white.</p>

		<p>Here is what is at the end of the original article:</p>
<p><i>Staff reporter Khalil AlHajal contributed to this report.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one part of the reason why his crimes, which were described as those of a white racist bigot serial <i>killer</i> a mere three days ago are now merely that of a serial <i>stabber.</i>  This article doesn&rsquo;t even mention race, whilst the articles of three days ago said that his victims were all black men with one black-ish Hispanic, the five that died in Flint were all black men, with the fact that two victims were white was a minor footnote way down deep in the article.</p>
<p>The articles of three days ago hinted that he might be Middle Eastern, but that was also deep down in the paragraph count.  I always thought that that was very possible, because most of his crimes were in Michigan.</p>

<p>Interestingly, MSNBC and CNN are silent to the point of deafening white noise suddenly on this story. </p>
<p>What a surprise? </p>
<p>Laughably, MSNBC has repeated its spectacularly unbiased &ldquo;documentary&rdquo; hosted by Comrade Chris Matthews, &ldquo;The Rise of The New Right&rdquo; today. You know the show, keeping up the fantasy that all murders, particularly racially motivated ones, are only the venue of the Timothy McV types, that are massed produced in that secret factory Rush Limbaugh and the Tea Party jointly own and operate. </p>

		<p>How many of our Moslem immigrants have gone on murderous rampages in recent years?   And this, while they are still a rather tiny minority! </p>
<p>What will it be when their numbers grow larger?</p>
<p>Yet, our foolish authorities constantly praise them as &#8220;The Religion of Peace&#8221;!   Could any contradiction with the facts be more glaring?</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s extremely unusual that we haven&rsquo;t had the same female news reporter, who described her terrible anguish at having to report the Times Square bomber was Middle Eastern instead of white, coming out with another hysterical rant about how she absolutely detests having to report on another one, especially since her hopes were so high after seeing the sketch.</p>
<p>I mean, how much can a true believer take?  Why won&rsquo;t these white men stand up, put on their sheets and hoods and go to work, so she can go into ballistic mode 24/7, as the incident is reported over and over and over again?</p>

		<p>Getting ready to board a flight to Isreal? I&rsquo;m highly suspicious of this one. I hope our intelligence agencies go over him with a fine tooth comb. Sounds like some sleeper agent, that would ignite some type of race war or internal crisis. That would take U.S. involvement out of the Middle East or any other foreign hot spot &amp; put the focus on the home front. Much like the Turk that shot the pope. He was Turk, trained by the Bulgarians who were a front for the dreaded KGB.</p>

At the press conference, after he was arrested, he was still identified as white.</p>
<p>I thought that was odd since once the suspect is caught, they usually drop the racial description. For example, you&rsquo;ll never hear this at a police press conference, &#8220;Tyrone Brown, <b>A BLACK MALE</b>, was arrested for murder&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yet, that&rsquo;s what the police spokesman did in this case; &#8216;Elias Abuelazam, <b>A WHITE MALE</b>, was arrested&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Note how he was a &#8220;White&#8221; serial killer and is now only a BROWN serial stabber. Reminds me of CNN and all their &#8220;experts&#8221; saying about five million times the D.C. sniper(s) was a White male and then, whoa and behold, dropping all mention of race when the killers turned out to be two blacks. </p>

		<p>I really didn&rsquo;t know if he was white or not.</p>

Like a lot of others, I had heard about these attacks and seen the sketches of the suspect before the arrest of Abuelazam. The attacks were said to be racially motivated because blacks had been stabbed, and the attacker was presented as a white man. Then it was said that that there were two white victims among the 20 who had been stabbed, therefore the attacks probably were NOT racially motivated after all. </p>
<p>Lessons: 1) White people are, by default, the accused in any racially motivated wrongdoing. 2) If white people are victims of wrongdoing, there can be no racial motivation. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s truly abominable that even descriptions of criminal suspects are given the PC treatment.  In this case, it appears that the desire was overwhelming to portray the perp as some raw-boned redneck in a baseball cap instead of a round-faced, dark-olive-skinned man who could have easily been mistaken for a Hispanic or light-skinned black man.  Of course, the liberal media wanted so badly for it to be some good ole&rsquo; boy sporting a Confederate flag on his pickup and a swastika on his bicep.  I wonder just how many descriptions the cops had of this character and just how many artists&rsquo; renditions.  There could have been dozens, but of course the MSM would choose the one with the ball cap.  They don&rsquo;t care how many of the fly-over folks get murdered, just as long as they can continue to manufacture evidence to support their cocktail-party topics.  </p>

		<p>I will wager he is no &#8220;Palestinian Christian&#8221; either. Sorry, but I do not BELIEVE these 3rd worlders even can be a &#8220;Christian&#8221;. How many times have we heard of Africans in Africa loving those White missionaries and PRETENDING to be Christian just to get all the freebies they brought with them. Not to mention these Christians who insist on adopting them and bringing a large percentage of them (as refugees) to America? Either Whites, especially Christians, are blind as a bat or have been programmed by their &#8220;leaders&#8221; to think their main duty is to save the whole world&hellip;.How insane are they?  Camp Of The Saints all over again.</p>

		<p>I dunno, this guy looks white enough to be called white to me.  Of course, any time a white is involved in a crime he/she is identified as white.  Any time a criminal isn&rsquo;t identified by race we may safely assume that the perpetrator is black.  This reaches absurd proportions when criminals are described meticulously by dress, height, weight, hair and eye color, and estimated age, but with no mention of race.  </p>
<p>You just have to know the code.</p>

		<p>Note to Information Insurgent:  I am an American living outside the U.S., so I did not receive a census form.  Just now I looked at the questions on the internet. Question 9 has a box you can check for White.  The problem is that many people who are not white will check that box, mixed-race people like Demi Moore, Elvis Presley, Cameron Diaz, etc.<br>
So, the real numbers for white people are actually lower than stated in the census statistics.  <br>
What the census form does not have is a box for mixed-race, so most people of mixed race check white.<br>
Middle Eastern people are not white.  Even the Saudi King has light skin, but he is not a white person.<br>
Go to any large American city and walk around.  You will find large areas where you will see that a vast majority of the people are not white.  Your country is gradually being stolen from you. </p>

<p>Yes, it is poster. Just like most of all European nations are being stolen. But, they can&rsquo;t steal what we don&rsquo;t allow them to have in the first place. We are giving our countries away with the help of our enemies in our government/media/academia and our Churches. In Europe Christianity is all but gone and the same is happening to America. How else could this happen except for the enemy infiltrating the Churches for eons?  </p>

</p>
<p>Canadians are familiar with this treatment. </p>
<p>Back in 1989 when the Montreal massacre occurred, the media bent over backwards to hide the racial identity of the Muslim assassin who, furious with feminists and non-subservient women, slaughtered fourteen young women at the University of Montreal. </p>
<p>The press reported that his name was Marc Lepine&hellip;which made him sound like an ordinary French Canadian. </p>
<p><b>His real name was Gamil Gharbi</b>. The Canadian media has never explained why it whitewashed his identity.</p>
