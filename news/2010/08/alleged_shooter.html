<h1>Alleged Shooter: I Killed the Racists</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven Yablonski, WFSB-TV (Hartford), August 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Questions are raised after police say Omar Thornton shot and killed eight people before taking his own life at Hartford Distributors on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;I killed the five racists that was there bothering me,&rsquo;&#8221; said Will Holliday, Thornton&rsquo;s uncle. &#8220;He said, &#8216;That&rsquo;s it. The cops are going to come in so I&rsquo;m going to take care of it myself.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Holliday said Thornton had been complaining to relatives that in several years he worked at Hartford Distributors he was confronted with blatant racism.</p>
<p>Holliday said, &#8220;He had some instances of racism at the company. They were hanging nooses in the bathroom and writing stuff like that. They were singling him out because he was the only black person there in that area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thornton&rsquo;s family said he had taken pictures of the threats and said they believe he just snapped Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This all could have been avoided,&#8221; Holliday said. &#8220;He went to the Union a couple of times with issues concerning what was going on, and it was not dealt with appropriately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teamster Jon Hollis flat-out denies any racism or noose. &#8220;This is nothing but a guy who flipped out,&#8221; Hollis said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One Union officials, who didn&rsquo;t want to be identified, said that Thornton was to be reprimanded for stealing. That officials told Eyewitness News that the alleged stealing was caught on video.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>The media jumps right in to provide an excuse via the relatives. The incidents were fabricated by the killer, I&rsquo;m sure. They are disrespecting and smearing the murder victims who can&rsquo;t talk back, but give a forum to the murderer&rsquo;s apologists. How low the mainstream media has fallen, it&rsquo;s beyond disgusting.  </p>

		<p>The ol noose card gets played yet again. How typical. The same company that lets him resign without being fired or arrested is hanging nooses in the bathroom. <br>
It&rsquo;s time for blacks to learn how to employ themselves. </p>

		<p>It goes without saying that if there had been the merest hint of racial harassment the company would have gone into overload with sensitivity training and fired anyone who had even looked at this guy wrong. Since the company has no record of any incident and the family has not produced anything other than hearsay it is probably safe to say there was nothing other than someone getting caught stealing and blaming it on &#8220;racism&#8221;</p>

		<p> A quiet man who had no history of violence? Gosh, he couldn&rsquo;t have been black, then! But seriously, folks, this just sounds like the same old routine we&rsquo;ve heard over and over before: A black can&rsquo;t get along with those he/she works with; the black claims he&rsquo;s being the &#8220;victim of White racism.&#8221; &#8220;Nooses&#8221;   &mdash;   real or drawn on a wall   &mdash;   and &#8220;the N-word&#8221; are &#8220;discovered&#8221; (sure they are!) by the &#8220;victim.&#8221; Thank God it doesn&rsquo;t usually lead to tragedy like this, but the refrain sounds very similar to what we&rsquo;ve heard before.</p>
<p> I notice that the killer&rsquo;s girlfriend&rsquo;s mom is White   &mdash;   which I presume means the girlfriend is, too. That also figures. Wonder if she helped him drink any of that stolen beer? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Family of mass murderer says years of &ldquo;blatant racism&rdquo; made him &ldquo;snap.&rdquo; </p>
<p>How awful.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s as I&rsquo;ve always said, things like this could be easily avoided if any blacks here who feel alienated or discriminated against would move to another country, preferably in Africa where their delicate personalities will not have to take on any aggravation brought about by looking at white faces and dealing with whites.</p>
<p>The fact is many blacks who have more privileges than any of the other races in the US feel discriminated against, even though they have advantages and opportunities over everybody else, yet they continue to suffer.  It&rsquo;s probably brought about by a hatred of whites which is exacerbated daily by black leaders and pundits who teach and preach them to hate whites constantly, on a daily basis, just as Rev. Jesse Peterson described.  He said he felt the same way until it dawned on him one day that he was being used and abused by the black leadership and white people with mental disorders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are few blacks with enough intelligence to come to the same conclusion as Rev. Peterson, and they not only reject any truth to the contrary, they relish and wallow in the hate speech encouraging anti-white hatred.  Remember how Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s congregation cheered and applauded everytime he denigrated whites and America?  And how about the NAACP members in the Shirley Sherrod video cheering when she told them she treated a white poorly, because she felt he should go &#8220;to his own kind for help,&#8221; even though she worked for the government paid with white dollars.  Yes, she tried to claim this was all behind her, but still that doesn&rsquo;t negate the anti-white cheering from the audience.</p>
<p>And, speaking of Jeremiah Wright, he IS pretty adept at whipping a black crowd into a frenzy with white hatred and hatred of America.  The Black Panthers are the same.  So are dozens of other black leaders and black organizations.  Too, the mentally disturbed whites on the radical left contribute whatever anti-white hatred they can as well, since they are sick and can&rsquo;t resist hating themselves for being white.  MSNBC, CNN, CBS, and NBC, are excellent at promoting hatred of white people and of making blacks think they are not privileged as they are.</p>
<p>Somebody in the medical field diagnosed the condition among blacks as paranoia, and suggested anyone so afflicted should leave the country immediately.  The condition not only leads to suicide after murdering innocent people, it could well lead to warfare on a massive scale since so many blacks have the same condition, because, in addition to being less capable on average than the other races in a country, and less intelligent, blacks are also more prone to mental illness.  And it is being mentally ill that creates tremendous danger for this nation and any other white nation that has allowed blacks to enter.</p>
<p>So, the bottom line is that we can&rsquo;t expect to have someone sit down for years giving militant, hate-filled blacks psychotherapy in order to keep them from committing crimes, hating whitey and killing people, so the only thing left to do for black sanity and to prevent anti-white violence is to encourage those blacks who feel they can no longer cope to migrate to another nation.  </p>
<p>They would be much happier for it.  It&rsquo;s something that should be given very serious consideration, especially since there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing whites could do to keep a vast majority of blacks from hating them short of leaving the country and turning it over to them.</p>
<p>But, even then blacks would hate whitey for all the problems that came up caused by themselves and would feel compelled to  blame whitey for them.  From all the cheering they do when one of their leaders denigrate whites and America, I get the distinct impression that their basic problem&hellip;.right along with paranoia&hellip;. is that they just love to hate.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;One Union officials, who didn&rsquo;t want to be identified, said that Thornton was to be reprimanded for stealing. That officials told Eyewitness News that the alleged stealing was caught on video.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interesting, from a sociological/psychological perspective that this man &ldquo;of color&rdquo; was about to be punished for theft, and then &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; because of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the largest problems we have in this country with all nonwhites, is a sociopolitical culture that fosters &ldquo;mental health&rdquo; issues and justifications for them via phantom &ldquo;racism.&rdquo; The absurdly sensationalized  concept of &ldquo;white privileged,&rdquo; is the other side of the coin with this. In this case we hear of: &ldquo;&hellip;hanging nooses in the bathroom and writing stuff like that,&rdquo; but about 99.9% of the time or greater, such claims turn out to be either outright lies or hoaxes with planted evidence by the &ldquo;victims.&rdquo; Then some act of violence, be it riots labeled as &ldquo;demonstrations&rdquo; or actual murder of whites (as happened here) is to be dismissed as &ldquo;acceptable reactions&rdquo; to both &ldquo;current and past institutionalized &lsquo;racism.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is all rancid hogwash; it is a mythologized multicultural &ldquo;dialectic,&rdquo; that sanctimoniously assumes its own correctness and encourages a self-fulfilling prophecy of &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; white genocide in the name of &ldquo;tolerance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Every time a Black murders someone or some people the media makes apologies for that person.  And it not only applies to Blacks.  Any non-White has the support of the media.  Every time I go to sites like CNN, MSNBC, AOL, YAHOO, etc. and there is a criminal portrayed it almost always is a White person.  When the Colombine shootings occurred the media relentless mentioned some sort of Nazi affiliation of the two kids that were the shooters.  They covered the story for months.  We heard about it for years.  When the Oriental named &#8216;Cho&rsquo; murdered 33 people - almost 3 TIMES AS MANY AS THE COLUMBINE shooters the media dropped the story in a couple of weeks.  You couldn&rsquo;t find an article on it.  When that Army psychiatrist, that is, Muslim Army psychiatrist shot 43 people the media instantly started making excuses for him and EVEN THE ARMY was making excuses and bowing at the altar of diversity.  By the way - the nut was shot - but he wasn&rsquo;t killed.  WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO HIM?  One would think that the media would be feeding us continuous updates.  No.  Gone.  How long is going to be before people start waking up to this?</p>

		<p>The black &#8220;community&#8221; keeps its stories of oppression alive and continue to nourish their grievances.  Then when one starts shooting Whites, they all together have a community alibi.</p>
<p>Whites should develop their own alibis.  What was done to us during Reconstruction I is unforgivable.  We need to let that fester until we are awakened by the pain and humiliation and devote ourselves to forcing them into account.</p>
<p>Here is a good formula for White Humanity, but unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not our creed. This is from a Jewish woman. Why couldn&rsquo;t we think of this? What&rsquo; wrong with Whites?</p>
<p><br>
How many of our White Mothers even know how to think like this? </p>
<p>Theirs is a victorious race, because they do this:</p>
<p>&#8220;She was like a sponge. Audrey would listen as her grandmother Sugie (as in sugar) wove the family stories as well as tales of Jewish legends, wise fools, heroes and holidays - into their everyday lives and Audrey would soak them up, storing them.&#8221;</p>

Roots are the past. Wings are the future.  Duh.</p>

<p>We believe sharing our stories gives us roots and wings.</p>
<p>� a sense of family and connection</p>
<p>� a sense of identity, knowing who you are and what you stand for </p>
<p>� a feeling of possibility and freedom</p>
<p>� a sense of being part of history, part of a community.<br>

		<p>Imagine this man murdering your family member or friend, someone he knew and one day just shot to death for no reason but his own failure and then to top it off&hellip; as you are grieving&hellip; you must endure accusations of racism, a horrible and untrue smear on their character after being killed? Wow, just wow.</p>
<p>I think the few smart blacks out there are not really happy about such a cry wolf exposition as they would rather save those accusations for better situations that are more believable. Also, they aren&rsquo;t happy about it and might even tell you that, those few smart ones&hellip; but know for sure when in black circles they are alright with it, and are even proud of it and taking amusement from it.</p>
<p>Everyday more and more are starting to realize the truth. That is about the only upside here.</p>

		<p>Reprimanded for stealing?  Anywhere I&rsquo;ve worked stealing would have resulted in immediate termination!  <br>
And, as far as &#8220;racist&#8221; incidents like hangman&rsquo;s ropes or scrawled epithets go, what are bosses supposed to do?  Tell employees not to hang or draw nooses or write nasty words on the wall?  People already know better.  All blacks can do, if they want to stay on the job with disliking whites, is ignore such incidents.  No one on any job is required to like anyone else.</p>

		<p>How pathetic to turn the killer of these people into some kind of victim for racial justice. Every time I think the news media can&rsquo;t hit another low, they come up with another piece of garbage like this. </p>
<p>The news articles on this reveal the liberal bias:</p>
<p>&#8220;Alleged Shooter: I killed the racists&#8221;</p>
<p>If a white had gone and killed black co-workers we know the headline would have been:</p>
<p>&#8220;White racists kills five blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why not a more truthful headline:</p>
<p>&#8220;Worker fired for stealing kills fellow employees in cold blood.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So the media turns a mass murderer into a martyr with dubious allegations of harrassment? And where did these harrassment allegations come from? Why from the mass murderer of course! There&rsquo;s one simple fact the media can&rsquo;t get around - a sane person doesn&rsquo;t go on a shooting spree. An insane person does, however, engage in paranoid delusions of persecution.</p>

<p>The mass murder spree shows the wickedness of one man &mdash; mass murderer Omar Thornton. But news reports about the spree show that the media is corrupt to the core and that the general population that consumes it is fully indoctrinated. </p>

		<p>I was the one of two Italo-Americans in a predominantly Irish-American Catholic school. I endured two years of constant harrassment including being called guinea, wop and dago as a daily routine. I stayed strong; never letting them know that it bothered me. Within  a few years I was just one of the kids and actually formed friendships with them. <br>
In today&rsquo;s society do you think that the law would have been lenient with me had I gone in and shot a few of them?</p>

		<p>The sickest angle to all this is that even if we were to believe this allegation of &#8220;racism&#8221; he was supposedly exposed to(which few sensible people will), we are apparently being asked to accept that what amounts to being called names is now somehow  an excuse for murdering 8 people in cold blood!! This narrative that &#8220;racism&#8221;(whatever that may mean in any given circumstance) is a sin so unforgivable, an immeasurable crime in and of itself, has reached mythic proportions - and people are dying as a result! This certainly puts the lie to the idea that all these liberal/PC ideas about race are just well-intentioned, harmless dreams of racial harmony and similar drivel. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so odd that so many of these blacks who make Race the focus of their whole lives seem to have white/blonde girl friends. It must be a psychological thing. They might feel empowered by having sex/dominating a white woman. I know 3 Jewish men whose parents survived Auschwitz during WWII. All 3 brothers have German wives (from Germany) It seems related to the black man/white woman syndrome. Interesting that all 3 Jewish men claim their wives are mortified and have feelings of guilt about being German. I suspect many of these white woman feel similar guilt because they must have to tolerate race talk and anti-white talk when with their black boyfriends.</p>

		<p>A few things here, pretty much ignored.</p>
<p>Blacks just aren&rsquo;t up to work. Especially work that has a tangible end result to it, such as delivering beer. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s easy to determine whether or not the beer was delivered or not. Blacks do somewhat better if a job is service related, where output isn&rsquo;t so easily seen. But the main issue is that they&rsquo;re not up to this society that their caught in through birth. As much as the fedgov tries to maintain the illusion of blacks moving forward in the workforce, the more the opposite is seen by everybody observing them. While we all agree that blacks aren&rsquo;t smart, they&rsquo;re smart enough to understand they&rsquo;re out of place in this workplace. That they&rsquo;re excluded from any real decision making (how many black engineers does anyone think were consulted in the BP oil leak in the Gulf?). After a period of time, this weighs on them. This shooting is an extreme case (for now) of their frustration, but it&rsquo;s understandable. They know nobody wants them around.</p>
<p>I think in general, their lives here in this country are living hells and the liberals, through fedgov meddling only make it worse for blacks by pushing them into places they can never hope to function in. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I hate that guy and what he did, but at some level, I think I understand.</p>
<p>This is all Really sad.</p>
<p>We tried to help blacks, but now we know, they can&rsquo;t be helped, not here anyway.</p>

		<p>I live in England and normally this kind of shooting outrage would occupy the media to the point of obsession,yet I have only found out about it by way of Amren.Could the news blackout(no pun intended)be anything to do with the fact that the perpetrator of this slaughter did not fit the usual &#8220;white loner/misfit&#8221; profile.</p>

		<p>Of course it was &#8220;racism&#8221; that drove the shooter over the edge. I mean what did attempted theft and being fired for it have to do with his crime?</p>
<p>When are Blacks EVER going to stop playing the race card? A thousand years from now, Blacks will still be humanity&rsquo;s &#8220;problem children&#8221;   &mdash;   perpetual underachievers and still blaming racism and slavery of a dozen centuries earlier for their dysfunctionality.</p>

		<p>If whites were so evil and hateful to him, this Thornton guy sure liked to surround himself with them. He was the only black at his company or &#8216;area&rsquo;, had a white girlfriend, and lived with her in the town of Enfield, which according to the last census was 90% white. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I was the one of two Italo-Americans in a predominantly Irish-American Catholic school. I endured two years of constant harrassment including being called &#8220;guinea&#8221;, &#8220;wop&#8221; and &#8220;dago&#8221; as a daily routine.&#8221; Taurus689 </p>
<p>   Yes, most urban whites have endured some type of humiliation: ethnic or otherwise. And yet, I&rsquo;ve rarely heard these incidents used as an excuse for extreme violence, except in the case of &#8220;white racism.&#8221; What rational person would exculpate a murderer because he had been called a &ldquo;wop&rdquo; or &ldquo;frog&rdquo; for that matter? Historically, hardened Mafia hit men have even brushed off such ethnic insults as trival. </p>

		<p>The Teamsters&rsquo; Union official bent over backwards to help this black keep his job after being caught stealing freight, and this was &#8220;racism&#8221;?  Since that union official was murdered for his trouble by the guy he was trying to help, we will never know the man&rsquo;s motivations for trying to help a known nonwhite thief keep a high-paying union job that requires very few genuine qualifications despite proven criminal misconduct at work, but I very strongly suspect that &#8220;racism&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t one of them.<br>

<p>&#8220;The black &ldquo;community&rdquo; keeps its stories of oppression alive and continue to nourish their grievances. Then when one starts shooting Whites, they all together have a community alibi.</p>
<p>Whites should develop their own alibis. What was done to us during Reconstruction I is unforgivable. We need to let that fester until we are awakened by the pain and humiliation and devote ourselves to forcing them into account.</p>
<p>Here is a good formula for White Humanity, but unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not our creed. This is from a Jewish woman. Why couldn&rsquo;t we think of this? What&rsquo; wrong with Whites?</p>
<p><br>
How many of our White Mothers even know how to think like this? </p>
<p>Theirs is a victorious race, because they do this:&#8221;</p>
<p>First problem, you don&rsquo;t recognize the Jewish is a relgion that includes a nubmer of ethnic communities and most Jews are in fact White, European Ashkenazis who have only seemed different because they believed different and were villified by early Christianity.  What most Westerners experience as anti-Jewish reflex is rooted in the 14th century Bubonic Plaque disaster where nearly everyone suffered some sort of persecution, but blame fell mostly on Jews who were accused of &#8220;poisoning wells.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you isolate any group, even a white group within a white group, you will produce an enclave that developes physical, but more importantly psychological defenses.  The Jews, being of an ancient tradition, valued education and the value of trustworthiness, so they were able to survive by being invaluable to European rulers through their banking and merchant skills.  Ironically, it was largely Jews who brought the first signs of economic recovery to the South.  (example; Macy&rsquo;s began in Atlanta via Jewish immigrants who brought goods South and sold them at better prices than carpetbagger whites).</p>
<p>Since Reconstruction White females have been systematically stripped of their antebellum culture and values that were routed in Western European tradtions of common sense and yes, even a set of values supported by Christianity.  Yet, the South also supported a greater intellectual acheivement than the North, most of whose residents had to struggle for a living in the Industrial Revolution that dominated the North.  One may simply read one or two Tennessee Willliams plays, or better yet, what a handful of classic movies like &#8220;A Streetcare Named Desire,&#8221;  &#8220;Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte,&#8221; and little known titles like &#8220;The Southerner,&#8221; in order to get a view of what was systematically done to the South. But the drive to rob Whites of their culture has gone to powers of ten since the 1960s.  Real history is suppressed, but it is still out there to be learned, for those who possess the will to work at it.</p>
<p>The commercial culture that dominates America is largely at fault.  It graps onto anything that appears likely to make a buck.  Right now, miscegenation and all sorts of sex related merchandizing from drugs that are supposed to make you a sexual tiger to clothing designs for little girls that make them look like whores, is how America is currently defining itself.  Is it any surprise that the first black president had no problem with being promoted as a quasi-sex object via phenomena like &#8220;The Obama Girls?&#8221;  </p>
<p>As Bob Dylan wrote the song, &#8220;Dignity&#8221; - &#8220;Looking high, looking low, looking everywhere I go, askin&rsquo; the cops wherever I go, Have you seen dignity?&#8221;</p>
<p>The cultivation of a New Dignity is where the beginning of the answer lies.  But we must be sure that the foundation is solid, and based on the truth about whites as a human tribe, stripped down to our essence and constructed from there.  Our roots are in our indigenous memories.</p>

So go back eight years and what do you have? A 26-year-old black thug exploiting and manipulating a stupid 18-year-old white woman.

If whites continue to justify and pacify the federal governments socialist policies, which in fact, are based upon white displacement and dispossession, there will be no more places where whites can be free to be white.<br>
Whites will fall prey to the socialist totalitarianism and violence of blacks like Omar Thornton, while blacks themselves will be displaced by a greater hispanic population.</p>
