<h1>Migrants Turn to the Sea to Enter US Illegally</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elliot Spagat, Google News, August 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is a new frontier for illegal immigrants entering the United States  &mdash;  a roughly 400-square-mile ocean expanse that stretches from a bullring on the shores of Tijuana, Mexico, to suburban Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In growing numbers, migrants are gambling their lives at sea as land crossings become even more arduous and likely to end in arrest. Sea interdictions and arrests have spiked year-over-year for three years, as enforcement efforts ramp up to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>While only a small fraction of border arrests are at sea, authorities say, heightened enforcement on land, and a bigger fence, is making the offshore route more attractive.</p>
<p>The number of Border Patrol agents doubled to more than 20,000 since 2003, and President Barack Obama is dispatching the National Guard after clamor for a crackdown in the desert led to Arizona&rsquo;s tough new immigration law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. agents arrested 753 suspected illegal immigrants on Southern California shores and seas between October and Aug. 24, up from 400 the previous 12 months and 230 the year before. They spotted 85 watercraft since October, up from 49 during the previous 12 months and 33 the year before.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. authorities have stepped up sea patrols near the border, forcing pangas loaded with illegal immigrants and sometimes with marijuana farther offshore with landings farther north.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities believe smugglers put their passengers ashore and return to Mexico, when possible, to avoid losing their boats and leaving evidence behind. But they also quickly abandon the boats and run for it if they sense they&rsquo;re about to be caught.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At up to $5,000 a person  &mdash;  roughly twice the fee to cross illegally over land  &mdash;  one overnight trip can generate $100,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Mexico, the boats launch from a poor fishing village named Popotla, about 15 miles south of the border. It sits between Playa de Rosarito&rsquo;s high-rise hotels and condos that cater to American tourists and expatriates and next to the studio where the 1997 blockbuster &#8220;Titanic&#8221; was filmed.</p>
<p>Squatters live in about two dozen shanties crammed on a hillside. There is no electricity, paved road, sewage or garbage collection.</p>
<p>But it is easy to understand why smugglers are drawn to the village. It&rsquo;s out of view from the highway only 200 yards away. Its crescent-shaped beach invites gentle waves and it is the only public boat launching spot on a 50-mile stretch south of the border.</p>

		<p>A NUMBER of years ago now I remember reading that at any given moment there are at least four to five boats carrying Chinese illegal aliens to the U.S.</p>
<p>Probably still the case. Folks crammed into a shipping container for the two week voyage across the Pacific too is a method used by the smugglers.</p>
<p>Ships bringing Chinese to settle in the U.S. during the 1800&rsquo;s were noted for their overpowering stench.</p>

		<p>Nothing more easy to track and stop than small boats in the open ocean. With radar and UAVs you can spot them the minute they leave Mexican beaches and cross the International line.<br>
There are no suburbs or back roads to hide in. Just <br>
a flat horizon. Go as far out as they like..they US Coast Guard <br>
will be waiting when they head back towards land..if the USCG<br>
is allowed to act by Obama</p>

		<p>The Navy at Coronado needs to gear up another version of Operation Market Time.  Pull the Swift Boats out of storage, mount the guns, gas the tanks, start the engines and go get &#8216;em.</p>
<p>San Diego is perfectly sited to interdict this type of smuggling activity.  Start running combat patrols south just off the three mile limit of the Mexican coast.  That will force the smugglers to stay within three miles of their own coast.</p>
<p>Once they cross the border boundary, their boats can be stopped and searched within our three mile limit, or on the high seas in international waters.  Of course, they can be stopped and searched off of Mexico - if they are in international waters.  Because of this, they will stay within three miles of the Mexican coast, till they get far enough north.  Once far enough north, they lose any legal cover and are forced out into the open.  Then let the Navy and Coast Guard pounce on them.</p>

		<p>Our government will do NOTHING to stop this, just as they do with the border. they WANT this invasion. Ask yourself WHY this is the case? It is NOT just for votes and cheap labor as the media(the left and the right)love to tell us. </p>
<p>They call it the &#8220;silent invasion&#8221; because most Americans haven&rsquo;t a clue about the REAL immigration problem or how many are coming and are already here since 1965.</p>

		<p>I remember much the same issue leading to a technology race as the USCG couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the &#8216;Go Fasts&rsquo; of Drug Smugglers.</p>
<p>Had to buy special purpose MH-68 helicopters and start using .50 caliber sniper rifles (as well as a host of underwater acoustic sensors and netcentric capabilities related to ASW) to start catching these 100 knot++ craft and the 2-5 ton shipments of narcotics contraband.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a game to them.  Something where, &#8216;as long as we have the better stats&rsquo; (better toys) it doesn&rsquo;t matter if we are winning or losing the border war.</p>
<p>Look at drugs.  Look at humans.  Neither one has been really controlled because nobody is going after the idiots where they live and doing things like devaluing their currency for not cleaning their own houses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s _a business_.  And the elites don&rsquo;t want that messed up beyond the cosmetic level.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Navy at Coronado needs to gear up another version of &#8220;Operation Market Time. Pull the Swift Boats out of storage, mount the guns, gas the tanks, start the engines and go get &lsquo;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Market Time was the Vietnam operation by the U.S. Navy to interdict weaponry coming south by sampan boat from North Vietnam. Was successful.</p>
<p>Those sailors COULD get a lot of good training. SEALS in particular would be well suited for this duty. Another means to provide realistic and good training. Marines seeking some pleasureable duty to test their mettle as well. Board the &#8220;enemy&#8221; vessels as was done in the olden times.</p>

		<p>I watched something called Gangland on Spike TV last night and it was about this gang MS-13. They came in by the tens of thousands from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras after that conflict down there. Thanks a lot Iran/Contra&hellip;.but of course the USA was blamed that these punks &#8220;formed&#8221; their gangs AFTER coming to L.A&hellip;blame Whitey again&hellip;</p>
<p>Talk about TERRORISTS!  They spread fear through their violence and take over whole communities and have spread into 41 States. More by now, as this was in 2005. Also check out the Mexican Mafia run out of our prisons. </p>
<p>I just wish ALL White Americans watch this over and over again and just see what these gangs are doing all across our nation. They far outnumber and out-man our police. We have NO White &#8220;gangs&#8221; to counter these people and if you watch this and really face facts, then this country is well on it&rsquo;s way to chaos and oblivion. </p>
<p>I highly doubt even our military can stop these invaders. The politicians won&rsquo;t let them to begin with. That is why they have our military all over the world and not here, doing the job they should be doing. Protecting OUR country! </p>
<p>Why do you suppose our own government has allowed this and STILL refuse to close that border? WE had better find out and STOP our own government for what they are doing to us. </p>

		<p>As various other posters have said above, it shoould be extremely easy to interdict these boats on the open ocean where there is nowhere to hide.  (And after all, our Pacific fleet is located in San Diago; how could it be better positioned for this task?)  </p>
<p>As #4  said, it is NOT just for votes, souls,  or cheap labor   &mdash;  as the media constantly tell us  (although all of those are certainly true).  It has a deeper ideological/racial  purpose (as exemplified by the election of Obama) of changing our national demographics and transforming this country from a formerly white, western, basically Christian society, into a multi-cultural, pan-racial hodgepodge &hellip; a Marxist&rsquo;s dream in which whites are rendered irrelevant, helpless, and no longer in control of their own destiny. </p>
<p>And as for the US Navy, I have to ask what good is it anyway? Why still bother to have it?  Its purpose is to defend us, no?  Then how can this invasion be happening directly under the navy&rsquo;s very nose and they do nothing, while they patrol foreign shores half a world away?  We have become pathetic.</p>
<p>As has been said so many times, our &#8220;representatives&#8221; no longer &#8220;represent&#8221; the people they were elected to serve. They serve special interests and the world&rsquo;s wealthy, those who can afford to fund their election campaigns. The common American citizen has been forgotten. </p>
