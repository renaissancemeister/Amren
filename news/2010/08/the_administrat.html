<h1><a href="https://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/08/the_administrations_cognitive.html">The Administration&rsquo;s Cognitive Dissonance on Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Serwer, Washington Post, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer is indignant that the State Department submitted a report to the United Nations Council on Human Rights with a paragraph on her state&rsquo;s new immigration law. She&rsquo;s accusing the administration of &#8220;submitting the duly enacted laws of a state of the United States to &#8216;review&rsquo; by the United Nations&#8221; and of &#8220;internationalism run amok.&#8221; And she&rsquo;s charging that it&rsquo;s hypocritical to single out the law while at the same time taking credit for &#8220;sophistication and breath of [the United States&rsquo;] anti-trafficking efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stretch to characterize the report as seeking international approval of domestic law. It merely acknowledges that the Arizona law &#8220;has generated significant attention and debate&#8221; and that it &#8220;is being addressed in court action that argues that the federal government has the authority to set and enforce immigration law.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The administration signaling concern over whether the Arizona law violates human rights standards is somewhat at odds with its own record of strict enforcement. During Obama&rsquo;s presidency, the number of deportations has grown to higher levels than those seen during the Bush administration. The administration has also expanded the &#8220;Secure Communities&#8221; program to every county along the Southwest border, much to the frustration of immigration-rights advocates. &#8220;Secure Communities&#8221; resembles the Arizona law in that it mandates that anyone arrested  &mdash;  not convicted, but arrested  &mdash;  by police have their identifying information forwarded to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, where their immigration status can be checked. According to immigration rights activists working with the federal government&rsquo;s own numbers, most of the immigrants deported through the &#8220;Secure Communities&#8221; program were either non-criminals or low-level offenders. {snip}</p>
<p>All of this makes clear that the administration isn&rsquo;t anywhere near as squeamish about deporting illegal immigrants as it is about pushing through some kind of comprehensive immigration reform package. The federal government opposes SB 1070 not because of a concern about human rights, but because the Arizona law unconstitutionally preempts the federal mandate to set immigration laws. {snip}</p>

		<p>The current administrations basic argument appears to be that the Constitution of the United States and its Bill of Rights violate human rights.</p>
<p>But then, what other argument would we expect them to endorse.  That is exactly what they want&hellip;an end to freedom as we know it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The federal government opposes SB 1070 not because of a concern about human rights, but because the Arizona law unconstitutionally preempts the federal mandate to set immigration laws.&#8221; Nobody here in Arizona set any immigration laws. All we did was adopt the Feds own immigration law that the feds set themselves. It&rsquo;s like if we made a law making bank robbery or kidnapping a state crime. It is a state crime, so why aren&rsquo;t they taking us to court over this preemption ploy with those crimes too?</p>

		<p>The other big irony is that the Fed lawsuit against SB 1070 doesn&rsquo;t mention racial profiling nor imply human rights abuses, yet Hillary Rodham Clinton&rsquo;s State Department report to the UN does.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your hint:  HRC.  I think she&rsquo;s setting up for a primary challenge, and is therefore trying to appeal to Hispanic voters.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, our treasonous government wants us to be invaded by Mexico. The only human rights violation is that of our government allowing us to be invaded and ethnically cleansed by Mexico.</p>

		<p>If it&rsquo;s &#8216;inhumane&rsquo; in the UN, it&rsquo;s ammunition to defend not just the action against SB1070 but also to force &#8216;reform&rsquo; on the totality of the States because, golly, we wouldn&rsquo;t want the rest of the world to think we were thugs.</p>
<p>Yeah Right.</p>
<p>As long as we are strong, we will be envied.  As long as we are in SWA, we will be feared.  As long as the potential to weaken us further exists in the importation of HORDES of illegals: more than 50 divisions worth in &#8216;troop strength&rsquo; each year, they will all applaud.</p>
<p>But they will still want to come.  As long as the dole flows.</p>
<p>About the only useful thing to be asked here is what kinds of support the cartel of companies and the cabal of non-white countries (that Obama has courted, directly or otherwise) can provide outside the nominal system of jurisprudence in the States that they would be embarrassed to do, inside it.</p>
<p>A &#8216;UN declaration&rsquo;?  Whoopy.  Some kind of &#8216;Trade Penalty?&rsquo;  Oh Boy!  Free resindance of unwanted MFNs!  Lowering our stats in the human rights ratings?  More good news if it means fewer want to come here!</p>
<p>What I hope, I truly hope, happens is that someone thinks things have backed off enough (perhaps because November is likely to be less a Republican sweep than a changing of the same traitorous guard) on and when the Praetorians make their annual demands of the Emperor before giving in to his &#8216;reform&rsquo;, the Tea Party has a plan in place to declare secession of at least 15 states.</p>
<p>It would finally wake up the nation that there IS SOMETHING HERE worth debating among ourselves, not listening to on television.</p>
<p>And then we can talk about &#8216;human rights&rsquo; when the majority of U.S. citizens not only rejects immigration but refuses to pay taxes to support a military occupation of the newly freed countries.</p>
<p>There has to come a point where a democracy means WE RULE THIS LAND.  Not our &#8216;representatives&rsquo;.  If it doesn&rsquo;t then it&rsquo;s not time to elect a new people.  It&rsquo;s time to erect a new nation.</p>

<p>Translation:</p>
<p>&lsquo;All of this makes clear that the administration isn&rsquo;t anywhere near as serious about enforcing existing laws directed against illegal &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; (even if only haphazardly so) as it is manically determined about pushing through some kind amnesty/undocumented reform package. The federal government opposes SB 1070 not because of a concern about invaders&rsquo; rights, but because the Arizona law constitutionally enforces the existing federal laws, and makes a mockery of this administration&rsquo;s attempts to unconstitutionally preempt these federal laws and establish an ephemeral sanctuary &ldquo;utopia.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Obama should ask for UN troops for the Arizona border. The UN could protect drug dealers and illegal immigrants from Arizona law enforcement agencies. Since the UN is very corrupt they would do a good job of working with the drug dealers and coyotes. </p>
