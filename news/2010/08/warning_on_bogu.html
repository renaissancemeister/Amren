<h1><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-election/warning-on-bogus-refugee-claims-20100810-11y7l.html">Warning on Bogus Refugee Claims</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yuko Narushima, Sydney Morning Herald, August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MIGRATION agents are helping clients lodge bogus refugee claims to stay in Australia, a former immigration official says.</p>
<p>In an opinion piece in the Herald, Patricia Cruise says people fly to Australia on legitimate visas and make false claims of religious persecution to avoid leaving.</p>
<p>Ms Cruise, who decided onshore refugee applications between 2005 and 2009 and also between 1993 and 1995, said such bogus claims were a far greater threat to Australia&rsquo;s borders than those arriving by boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;More numerous than the asylum-seekers coming by boat are the thousands who arrive in Australia by plane and apply for refugee status under the onshore refugee program,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The majority of bogus asylum-seekers are from China, with smaller numbers coming from India and other south-east Asian countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Cruise said migration agents were complicit in the fraud and rehashed successful asylum claims. A common theme was religious persecution, for holding Christian beliefs or adhering to Falun Gong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over many years, the industry of bogus onshore refugee applicants has been very profitable for those involved. It poses far fewer risks than organising people-smuggling via boats but offers greater and more consistent rewards. The federal government has failed to address the problem over just as many years,&#8221; Ms Cruise said.</p>
<p>The chief executive of the Migration Institute of Australia, Maureen Horder, said the majority of migration agents acted responsibly and the industry was subject to high levels of scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone has evidence that someone is acting illegally and purporting to be a migration agent then it is within their power to act against those people and apply the force of law against them,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The immigration department says the majority of asylum seekers in Australia arrive legally and subsequently apply for protection. Its officers who process applications for protection visas are versed in the law, policy and procedures concerning the Refugees Convention.<br>

		<p>Most all refugee claims are bogus to begin with. Even if they were not &#8220;bogus&#8221; why should we or any other White nation take them in unless they are White refugees? Let their own racial countries take them in and support them. We have NO duty or obligation to these 3rd world refugees whatsoever. It is the enemy within that started this whole thing and convinced so many Whites (especially Christians) that this is the biblical and moral thing to do, when in reality it is no such thing.</p>

		<p>The best place to monitor the refugee/asylum scam (disaster) is a blog called Refugee Resettlement Watch:<br>

		<p>Falun Gong is a fake religion akin to Scientology invented less than 20 years ago for the personal financial profit of its founders.</p>
<p>If people want to provoke the ire of the Chinese Communist Party by joining a new age cult then let them reap the consequences. We should not reward people for being gullible and feeble minded.</p>

		<p>The Canadian authorities are aware of the scam.</p>
<p>A few years ago a Canadian daily newspaper sent undercover reporters to talk with Chinese immigration consultants.  Posing as Chinese nationals trying to stay in Canada, the reporters were told to &#8220;claim to be a Falun Gong member or a Christian facing persecution in China.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was 2007.</p>

		<p>Sydney is becoming an Asian melting pot city through legal migration. 95%+ of non-whites come in legally through the front door. I am almost not concerned about these few thousand illegals that cheat the system each year because either something is going to be done about the masses of non-whites that have set anchor over the past couple of decades, legal or not, or nothing will be done at all and it matters little if a few thousand more are added on top of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who stroll in through the front door each year. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they don&rsquo;t have the right to be here in such masses either way.</p>

		<p>Would not be surprised if Falun Gong were a highly successful CCP double-agent enterprise.  There are an intriguingly high number of attractive (even by Western standards) female members, no doubt to entice technologically-gifted but tongue-twisted North American nerds to give up their secrets.  </p>

		<p>With the pretense of humanitarian ideals the politicians of the West are just selling out their countries for the minority block vote and the vote of the feeble minded bleeding hearts.</p>
<p>It has to be stopped. Vote in right wing parties that are the only hope.</p>

		<p>There should be a website.</p>
<p>Every time someone asks why we can&rsquo;t take in &#8216;just a few more&rsquo; we should be able to point to a website and ask the following:</p>
<p>1.  What&rsquo;s your address and how many X-ethnic (not like you) live nearby.<br>
2.  Where&rsquo;s the nearest X-ethnic (NLY) and how high is their crime rate.<br>
3.  What nation state does the next X-ethnic (NLY) come from and what is -their- declared &#8216;open borders&rsquo; status?<br>
4.  What is the percentage homogenity of X-ethnic&rsquo;s homeland and what is their current economic status?<br>
5.  What is the relevant IQ and SES playout of X-ethnic? (.73 correlation between IQ and salary/success in life)?<br>
6.  What is the average TFR of ethnic-X (NLY), at home and here?</p>
<p>If you or your kid are not interested in breeding with X.  Either because they are not attractive to you.  Or because they have high criminality.  Or because they offer lower SES improvement status to your own.  Or because &#8216;their national standards&rsquo; on free love are not as open as they seem to want yours to be.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s time to realize that importing competing populations will only make your own life -harder- in terms of slicing the pie into more, smaller, chunks.                              </p>
<p>Chunks which will outnumber you if you let them breed at the rate they do, here, (Mexican women breed 2.4 in Mexico, here they are at 2.8 and rising).</p>
<p>ONLY when the full numbers are revealed and the ethnic change shown on a MAP which shows how rapidly Western Europeans are losing ground, will it begin to sink in that we have been lied to.  And that this is genocide.  Not &#8216;a unity of diversity&rsquo;.</p>
