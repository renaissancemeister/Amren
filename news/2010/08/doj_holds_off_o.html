<h1>DOJ Holds Off on Suing Arpaio  &mdash;  For Now</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Levine, Fox News, August 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department says it won&rsquo;t follow through on a threat to sue controversial Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio  &mdash;  at least not for another week.</p>
<p>According to a Justice Department official, things are on hold pending a meeting set for next Tuesday in Washington with Justice Department officials and lawyers for Arpaio, whose office is under investigation by the Justice Department for alleged civil rights violations. Arpaio has become a controversial figure over what some say are overly aggressive tactics to fight illegal immigration in Arizona.</p>
<p>In a letter dated Aug. 3, the head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division, Tom Perez, accused Arpaio of failing to cooperate with the department&rsquo;s investigation, warning that, &#8220;Absent [your office&rsquo;s] voluntary cooperation with this investigation within two weeks  &mdash;  by August 17, 2010  &mdash;  the Department will file a Title VI civil action to compel access to the requested documents, facilities, and personnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Justice Department launched its investigation in March 2009, telling Arpaio in letters at the time that the &#8220;investigation will focus on alleged patterns or practices of discriminatory police practices and unconstitutional searches and seizures conducted by the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, and on allegations of national origin discrimination, including failure to provide meaningful access to MCSO services for limited English proficient individuals.&#8221; In addition, the Justice Department said, the investigation will look at allegations that Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office &#8220;has an English-only policy in its jails,&#8221; including a requirement that even bilingual detention officers &#8220;speak to inmates in English at all times, except in case of an emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Arpaio&rsquo;s office subsequently provided some documents, it has largely refused to meet the Justice Department&rsquo;s requests. Arpaio has criticized the investigation as politically motivated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio&rsquo;s lawyers argue that their client is {snip} not obligated to comply with requests not covered by Title VI, particularly requests related to &#8220;alleged patterns or practices of discriminatory police practices and unconstitutional searches and seizures conducted by the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a grand jury in Phoenix is looking into separate matters related to Arpaio&rsquo;s tenure as sheriff.<br/>

		<p>So the DOJ chickened out.  One must wonder whether Holder - who is obviously on the other side - was behind the death threats against Sheriff Arapio.</p>

		<p>I live in Arizona and can tell you most here like Sheriff Joe. And as most probably know Arizona suffers most from the massive influx of illegals since we are a border state. And since Arizona didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama we know we will continue to be targeted by him. It&rsquo;s pretty common knowledge that Obama really goes after those whom he percives as political enemies. </p>

		<p>So the Feds are upset due to Arpaio&rsquo;s lack of &#8220;voluntary cooperation.&#8221;  Isn&rsquo;t that what sanctuary cities do also?  Sanctuary city mayors issue directives to police not to cooperate with Federal immigration officers.  This policy is directly responsible for the deaths of numerous people around the country, including cops.  Why aren&rsquo;t the mayors &#8220;investigated?&#8221;  In states that issue licenses to illegals, why aren&rsquo;t the governors investigated?  You can ignore federal law and its fine, but enforcing it or insisting the government enforce it will get you in trouble.  </p>

		<p>Joe Arpaio doesn&rsquo;t do that job for the paycheck. That&rsquo;s for sure. There are few men I admire as much as Sheriff Arpaio.</p>

		<p>Every day Obama and his black bro&rsquo; Holder do something else to get conservatives elected to office.  Furthermore, the unconstitutional actions of far-left judges are driving the country into a situation in which states will be compelled to refuse federal judgments.  Federal troops were once sent to desegregate a few schools, but are they going to be dispatched to every church to force preachers, priests, rabbis, and imams to perform same-sex marriages?  </p>

<p>  They won&rsquo;t sue Sheriff Joe Arpaio until after the November election. For the next couple of months, the Democrats, and some RHINOS, will pretend to be tough on border control. For us, Joe Arpaio is a modern day American hero, but to the effete liberal elite he&rsquo;s the Mussolini of dog patch  &mdash;  such is the polarization of contemporary America!</p>

		<p>Something has to give.  This country cannot stay as a democratic nation if it consistently and persistenly goes against its own citizens.  There is corruption in every level of the government.  Richard Fine (see website Free Richard Fine), a seventy year old attorney has been held in solitary confinement for 18 mos without being charged.  He is basically held as a political prisoner because he strumble onto massive corruption and decided to do about it.<br/>
Now the feds are going after Joe Arpaio for trying to enforce the law.  The power behind the throne wants this country to be broken apart and down.</p>
