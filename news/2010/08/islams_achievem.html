<h1>Islam&rsquo;s Achievement Gap</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tait Trussell, Front Page Magazine, August 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Muslims represent 25 percent of the planet&rsquo;s population  &mdash;  more than 1 billion, according to About Encyclopedia.com; some say more.  Now, how many Muslims have been Nobel Prize winners for science? Just two: Ahmed Zewail in 1999 for chemistry and Abdus Salam in 1979 for physics. For those keeping score, which apparently does not include the apparently, that&rsquo;s two prize winners in more than a billion Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But even using Islamic metrics, the achievements of the Muslim world seem dubious at best. The Islamic Development Bank (IDB), founded to foster economic development in its 57 member countries, released a major study in 2008 showing just how far behind Islamic countries lagged behind the developed world. The study stated that while &#8220;Education forms the basis for developing innovation, science and technology .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. according to the UN only six Islamic countries fall in the high human development index (HDI), 22 in the medium, as a many as 23 in low HDI category.&#8221; The lowest-ranking Islamic country ranks 173rd in a list if 178 countries.</p>
<p>The study went on to note:<blockquote>The entire Muslim world constituting one-fifth of humanity, contributes barely 1,000 research articles out of 100,000 science books and 2,000,000 research articles published annually. While the West has an average of 3,000 science PhDs per million of its inhabitants, the number of IDB member countries is so dismally small that not even the statistics are available.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.nbsp;. The 57 predominately Muslim countries have about 23 percent of the world&rsquo;s population, but less than 1 percent of its scientists who generate less than 5 percent of its science and make barely 1 percent of the world&rsquo;s original research discoveries each year.</p>
<p>Although notable for its sober look at the Muslim world&rsquo;s dearth of recent achievement, the IDB study did repeat the stock claim Islam once led the world in scientific endeavor.  &#8220;The deficiency in Muslim science and technology is particularly intriguing, given that Muslims were world leaders in science and technology a millennium ago,&#8221; the study lamented. {snip}</p>
<p>The evidence suggests otherwise. Some scholars conclude that Islamic countries largely failed in developing modern science. According to a paper published by Global Politician, &#8220;Middle Eastern individuals primarily using the Arabic language included Arabs, Iranians, Christians, Jews, and others who were in the forefront of scientific advance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not necessarily Arab Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, Toby E. Huff, chancellor professor of policy studies at University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, and author of studies in the rise of science, has written that &#8220;Islamic science was almost totally dependent upon translations, frequently made by non-Muslims of the achievements of pre-Islamic cultures, Greeks, Egyptians, Indians, etc. Moreover, a striking number of Muslim thinkers were Persians who owed more of their pre-Islamic heritage than they did to Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>David Storobik, editor of Global Politician, the journal of international politics, said it is &#8220;an historical fact that the scientific revolution happened in Europe, not India, China, or the Middle East. There was also nothing quite like the medieval university in the Roman Empire. Whatever existed of real science in Roman times was almost entirely of Greek Origin. The medieval University then represented a real innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} In the fall of 2009, Saudi Arabia launched a new graduate university for the sciences, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. But lest President Obama and the usual enthusiasts claim that this move represents Islam&rsquo;s return to a tradition of achievement, it&rsquo;s worth nothing that the school&rsquo;s $10 billion endowment  &mdash;  the sixth largest in the world.  &mdash;  came from the United States.</p>

		<p>I am Arabic Muslim on my own, but I was always the best in my school although nearly all my classmates were German. Now I study Mathematics and Engineering.</p>
<p>Before I got a Race-Realist, the question made me sick. I always asked myself: &#8220;Why is all my family so stupid? I don&rsquo;t expect them to be Newton or Heisenberg but why can&rsquo;t they just be median. Why do all of them have to be very stupid and criminal? Why is my brother stealing things again and again. And why isn&rsquo;t he able to explain me the reason he did it? Why didn&rsquo;t he know the reason for what he did? I sometimes thought about weather he had a switch button on his head which he used to switch his brain off whenever he could. You can talk to him rough or soft or beat him or just ignore him or show him how disappointed you are, he always steals again and again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one important reason why so many people aren&rsquo;t Race-Realists. You can talk with Low-IQ people, they act mostly like you, they look like you, you can talk with them about movies and about the weather. And suddenly you see the police accusing them of robbery and you see that they have many bad grades at school and if you learn with them, you can&rsquo;t understand why they need so much time for obvious things.</p>
<p>Then you can go two ways: Either you can blame whitey or you can think and understand that this few differences, the difference that they aren&rsquo;t good at maths and logics, the difference that they are able to make the same stupidity again and again and the difference that he doesn&rsquo;t want to work hard, that this few differences can make big differences in the society. You can understand that this few differences make the big difference between people sending men on the moon and inventing computer, and the people who are still at the level of 10 000 BC.</p>
<p>It is really hard to understand for many people that a few differences between races can make so huge differences between the societies they create.</p>

		<p>Many historians, of many different religious persuasions including atheistic, have shown that modern science started to flourish only in largely Christian Europe. For example, Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was stillborn in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture of Europe. Islam actually reverses progress degrading societies that implement Islamic law.</p>

		<p>I disagree with the author&rsquo;s tone, that the Arab world should be compared to our standard. </p>
<p>Long before Europe developed the world&rsquo;s first technological society, the Arabs had a distinct &#8216;way of life&rsquo;. It is not for us to criticize the slower pace of some civilizations.  </p>
<p>If they like things their way, they should not be bothered because of it.</p>
<p>If every society is accepted for its distinctiveness, then it strengthens our argument for white culture being unique.</p>
<p>It may then follow that white culture is a distinct entity which should be defended and preserved. </p>

		<p>7-Jeddermanm: &#8220;&hellip;in the rest of the Islamic world, produce mostly RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS AND NOT SCIENTIFIC MINDS&#8221;. I agree with Jeddermann, and believe a major part of the problem lies in the teachings of the Koran. Having their populations learning such convoluted, and by rote, thought patterns at a very early age as they do, is obviously a hinderance in learning any higher level science.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t question the facts of the article as far as scientific achievement is concerned, but what about genetic survival. The only significant group of Caucasians that are not becoming extinct are Muslims. A hundred years ago, Europeans colonized Muslim countries; today the situation is reversed. </p>

		<p>Arabic numerals were invented in India.  It was not until they reached Europe that modern rules for arithmetic were invented.   <br>
 <br>
At its height Arabic civilization was largely derivative.  Aristotle was read in translation, but it was not until the Italian Renaissance that men like Galileo tested Aristotle&rsquo;s assertions and found many of them to be mistaken.<br>

		<p>what does Islam do to Europeans? Look at Bosnian Muslims &amp; Albanians, who&rsquo;ve contributed even LESS than AfroAsian Muslims. Why are Gulf states dominated by foreign engineers, architects &amp; programers &amp; laborers? Because Islam is is an autistic anti-innovative religion that deems anything beyond the Quran as unnecessary.</p>

		<p>Look what the great Muslim diversity is doing in Scandanavia. Even the Danes are beginning to see the error of their ways.<br>
Sadly the left wing philosophy and Christianity have made wimps of us all. Jesus could afford to turn the other cheek because he knew that he would rise from the dead in three days. Perhaps the Danes, Norwegian and Swedes should revisit their old Gods  like Odin, Thor etc. That spirit made them the most feared people in Northern Europe at one time. <br>
As for the Muslims, these countries should begin immediate deportation of all of them. What kind of society that wants to survive permits Imams to preach from their mosques that Danish, Swedish and Norwegian women deserve to be raped because they&rsquo;re all whores. <br>
These people are &#8220;bacteria&#8221;  as Vladimir Putin described them after Sep. 11. They&rsquo;re like termites who eat away at a society and culture &#8216;til there&rsquo;s nothing left and then they move on to from new colonies in another candy ass Western Country.<br>
They along with our own home grown third worlders belong back where they or thsit ancestors came from. That kind of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; kills. </p>

		<p>The Moslem scholars of the past were probably men of European stock who stood above and beyond the low-brow mysticism of the masses.  As Moslem communities devolved into anti-democratic, mysogynistic, inbred societies, any excellence became sublimated.  Now these societies are, in many ways, on par with the most backward ones on the planet.</p>

		<p>When I was a college student (in the mid-70&rsquo;s), most of the Muslim students I knew  were from Egypt or Iran (when the Shah Reza Pahlavi was chummy with the U.S.). Every one of them was an engineering major. I thought to myself at that time, why were they studying engineering given that their culture is so hostile to science?</p>
<p>Maybe they were studying engineering to make bombs.</p>

		<p>Please, in the midst of this discussion, let&rsquo;s stay focused on Islam. We need to stay away from issues like &#8220;Christianity is bad for Europe&#8221;.  </p>
<p>We as whites need to come together.  We don&rsquo;t have time to divide over petty issues.  I am disgusted how  sometimes people in this movement bash red state whites more than they do Third World people.  It makes you no more different from a liberal in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you look at history it is simply inaccurate to say Christianity was bad for Europe.  During some of the years that we were the most Christian (the Reformation, and the prudish Victorian Age etc&hellip;.), Europeans for some reason were the most racially aware as well as the most scientific.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that Christianity has been infiltrated with political correctness just like every institution in the West.  Please direct your anger elsewhere, &hellip;.not at Christ. </p>
<p>And I think a lot of you misunderstand &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221;.  He wasn&rsquo;t saying &#8220;be a door mat&#8221;. He was saying something along the lines of &#8220;if your neighbor murders your wife, what good does it do you to repay him by murdering his wife&hellip;&hellip;two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right&hellip;and in the end, you both end up in prison&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for Islam, most of it&rsquo;s achievements were based on the works of Greeks (science), Hindus (numerals and math), and Persians (math).  All three of those groups were Indo-European.  This is obviously a racial issue.  If you read Rushton&rsquo;s work, it is obvious that caucasians in the Middle East (arabs/semites) have much lower IQs than European peoples do.  It wasn&rsquo;t arab Muslims who were responsible for Islam&rsquo;s Golden Age.</p>

		<p>The prior articles on this site about cousin marriage may have something to do with it. It might nicely explain why Muslims, while otherwise Caucasian, have an IQ of 85 compared to 100 for Europeans.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church banned cousin marriage, even placing restrictions on third cousins (somehow, they figured out that fourth cousin marriages were mildly beneficial and had no restrictions on them at all) and only royals were able to get away with it for political purposes.</p>
<p>Islam, however, encouraged it. Not allowing your young men to even SEE unrelated young women means the only recourse is to have them marry related women. The gene pool got dumber and dumber, and while Europe crawled out of the Dark Ages, Islam, which started in an advantageous position, went in.</p>
<p>So to Blabla: The best advice I&rsquo;d give to you is do NOT marry a cousin. No matter what your family says. Don&rsquo;t do it. Your progeny will thank you.</p>

<p>Funny thing - Christian monks preserved copies of the old Greek and Roman manuscripts. People from formerly Christian families became the successful scientists and thinkers of &#8220;medieval islam.&#8221; Christian slaves fought wars for their muslim masters. </p>
<p>Maybe these people really are incapable of doing a single darn thing by themselves? The really bright ones turn away from islam in my experience.</p>

		<p>Brendan,</p>
<p>Posters who make points like what you make are missing the overall point and trying to make environmental excuses as to why Muslims aren&rsquo;t as smart today.  </p>
<p>Why did Muslims decide marrying their cousins was okay, while Europeans eventually did not?  Not all caucasians are equal.  </p>
<p>As I said, it was Greeks, Persians etc&hellip;who were making all the advances; not semetic arabs or other brown skinned caucasians.  The brown skinned caucasians who formed earlier civilizations in those regions, created civilizations (Egypt, Babylon) that never amounted to those of Indo-European peoples.</p>
<p>The brown skinned peoples of the Middle always had lower IQs than white Europeans. Why did Indo-Europeans such as Persians, Greeks, and Romans, conquer them so easily?  White people conquered the Middle East easily but brown skinned Middle Easterners never made it very far into Europe even when they were &#8220;more advanced&#8221;.</p>
<p>Stop acting as if arab semites who originated in the Arabian Peninsula are the same as white skinned Europeans who originated north of the Black Sea just because they are caucasian.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gene pool got dumber and dumber, and while Europe crawled out of the Dark Ages, Islam, which started in an advantageous position, went in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ummmm&hellip;&hellip;.this advantageous position you speak of that Islam started on wasn&rsquo;t even it&rsquo;s own, it was that of Indo-European peoples, not bedouin arabs who progenated Islam.</p>
