<h1>UT&rsquo;s Affirmative Action Policies Questioned in Court</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Caitlin Perrone, The Horn (University of Texas, Austin), August 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The University of Texas petitioned before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans on Tuesday to maintain the university&rsquo;s current admission policy, which considers race as a factor when deciding student admissions. The trial was held before a three-panel judge in response to a lawsuit filed in 2008, which challenged the university&rsquo;s affirmative action policies.</p>
<p>According to The Statesman, this is the first case to challenge a university&rsquo;s affirmative action policy in regards to student admissions since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2003, where the federal court upheld the consideration of race during the admission process at the University of Michigan Law School. In 2008, Abigail Fischer and Rachel Michalewicz filed a lawsuit against the University of Texas after being denied from the school, claiming the University of Texas&rsquo; &#8220;race-conscious policy violated their civil and constitutional rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 1996 case, Hopwood v. Texas, forbade the use of race in admissions. In response, the Top 10 Percent Plan, which automatically accepts all students in the top 10 percent of their high school class, became Texas&rsquo; race-neutral admissions policy.</p>
<p>Hopwood v. Texas was however nullified 2003 after the U.S. Supreme Court approved the use of race as a factor for admission at the University of Michigan Law School. Immediately after the decision, the University of Texas added race to their mixture of factors in regards to admission, all the while upholding the Top 10 Percent Plan.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not like the Top 10% plan isn&rsquo;t affirmative action.  You can be pretty stupid and finish in the Top 10% of your graduating class in certain high schools.  Is someone who, for example, finished in 49th place out of 500 graduates at the Ghettoville Magnet Comprehensive Career Academy for the Arts, Mathematics, Science and Music, more worthy than yours truly, who finished one place under the Top 10% in a small graduating class?</p>

		<p>100% all White women&rsquo;s basketball team noted for academic achievement. Why didn&rsquo;t they recruit some Diversity to raise the collective GPA even higher? Oh, sorry, that&rsquo;s impossible.  Diversity pulls everything down.</p>
<p>Sewanee football team never noted for academic achievement, but has too much Diversity, so what did you expect.</p>

		<p>UT has practiced affirmative incompetence for years . The law school has a special admissions program for minorities to enter during summer semester breaks so that can hide their discrimination. I knew a UT law grad once a beneficiary of hispandering who had prior felony convictions.</p>

		<p>HIGHLIGHTS OF A RECENT STUDY OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AT EIGHT TOP SELECTIVE UNIVERSITIES</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new study by Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and his colleague Alexandria Radford is a real eye-opener in revealing just what sorts of students highly competitive colleges want   &mdash;   or don&rsquo;t want   &mdash;   on their campuses and how they structure their admissions policies to get the kind of &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; they seek. The Espenshade/Radford study draws from a new data set, the National Study of College Experience (NSCE), which was gathered from eight highly competitive public and private colleges and universities (entering freshmen SAT scores: 1360).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Race has a profound effect on one&rsquo;s chances of admission, all other things being equal:</p>
<p>&#8220;The box students checked off on the racial question on their application was thus shown to have an extraordinary effect on a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the highly competitive private schools in the NSCE database. To have the same chances of gaining admission as a black student with an SAT score of 1100, an Hispanic student otherwise equally matched in background characteristics would have to have a 1230, a white student a 1410, and an Asian student a 1550.&#8221;</p>
<p>The depth of the discrimination against lower-class whites is, however, shocking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely.  These are enormous differences and reflect the fact that lower-class whites were rarely accepted to the private institutions Espenshade and Radford surveyed. Their diversity-enhancement value was obviously rated very low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do elite universities have a profound bias against lower-income whites, all other things equal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;since they [universities] have a limited amount of money to give out for scholarship aid, they reserve this money to lure those who can be counted in their enrollment statistics as diversity-enhancing &lsquo;racial minorities.&rsquo; Poor whites are apparently given little weight as enhancers of campus diversity, while poor non-whites count twice in the diversity tally, once as racial minorities and a second time as socio-economically deprived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ugly truth is that most colleges, especially the more competitive private ones, are fiercely concerned with their ratings by rating organizations like U.S. News &amp; World Report. And an important part of those ratings consist of a numerical acceptance rate (the ratio of applicants received to those accepted) and a yield score (the ratio of those accepted to those who enroll). The lower the acceptance rate and the higher the yield score the more favorably colleges are looked upon. In extending admissions to well-qualified but financially strapped whites who are unlikely to enroll, a college would be driving both its acceptance rate and its yield score in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Affirmative action lowers the standards of the modern society created by the white man. This is why I&rsquo;m ambivalent about affirmative action for white women. If a white woman can maintain or surpass the high standards set by the white man, I&rsquo;m all for her. Otherwise other choices need to be made. And the wretched attitude shown by our &ldquo;elites&rdquo; towards our poor whites cuts at the quick of what this country is supposed to be about. I&rsquo;m beginning to feel deprived of the world that would have been created had only white people been involved. </p>

		<p>I think the real danger here is in the longer term.</p>
<p>There is a tenuous but necessary link between socio groups which is bridged by college.  The poor but driven meet the smart and well prepared and &#8216;love of diversity&rsquo; being what it is with youth, often there will be marriage or at least long term association with the possibility of kids.</p>
<p>If the meeting conditions of that mating pool is racially rather than meritocritously preconditioned, you see a breakdown in the caste outreach and either a loss of breeding pair interests (until much later in middle age, as a panic) or miscegenation as a given alternative.</p>
<p>Where there is an &#8216;unspoken agreement&rsquo; that, as class groups merge upwards and level out, through their brightest children, so too do the lower classes continue to contribute to the basic running of society; breaking the bond between racial ingroups is breaking down the strength of the the social cement that holds the nation itself together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how this can be considered a good thing when we are already at something like 1.91 TFR without the additive effect of &#8216;declared white&rsquo; immigrant hispanics to achieve sustainment level reproduction.</p>
<p>Some things are better left unfettered by social equalization effects.  Particularly when groups that represent 2-3% and 6-8% of the overall population are themselves &#8216;unfairly privileged&rsquo; in their 25 and 23 percent enrollment advantages.</p>
<p>We are destroying America as a sustainable, symbiotic, system.  And what is coming out of that is not better than what existed before the social engineering modification.</p>

		<p>There is a special category of anti-white bias praciticed by our elite universities   &mdash;  - beyond the profound bias against lower-income whites   &mdash;  - that is noteworthy.  That is the bias against applicants who have had leadership roles in 4H clubs, Future Farmers of America and ROTC:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;what Espenshade and Radford found in regard to what they call &#8220;career-oriented activities&#8221; was truly shocking even to this hardened veteran of the campus ideological and cultural wars. Participation in such Red State activities as high school ROTC, 4-H clubs, or the Future Farmers of America was found to reduce very substantially a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the competitive private colleges in the NSCE database on an all-other-things-considered basis. The admissions disadvantage was greatest for those in leadership positions in these activities or those winning honors and awards. &#8220;Being an officer or winning awards&#8221; for such career-oriented activities as junior ROTC, 4-H, or Future Farmers of America, say Espenshade and Radford, &lsquo;has a significantly negative association with admission outcomes at highly selective institutions.&rsquo; Excelling in these activities &lsquo;is associated with 60 or 65 percent lower odds of admission.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

		<p>A caveat, anytime your professional person seems to be a person of Affirmative Action reception, avoid them.  Be reasonable, they arrived at this present station with less than &#8220;earned credentials.&#8221;  Go for those who have earned the position.</p>
<p>South Texas is replete with idiocy.</p>

		<p>As a high schooler living in Texas, I have heard much about the &#8220;Top Ten 10%&#8221; rule. I really don&rsquo;t care about it, since I&rsquo;m planning on going to college out of state anyway, but one of my teachers did open my eyes as to just how unfair it really is. As someone may or may not have already pointed out, graduating top 10% in a run-down, minority-infested inner-city slum &#8220;school,&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t make you nearly as deserving of a slot in the college of your choice as graduating top 10% in a prestigious, all-white private school does. My 8th grade American History teacher gave us the example of a girl he knew of who had a 4.0 GPA, excellant athletics and academic extra-curriculars and all that, but who wasen&rsquo;t in the top ten percent due to obviously quite fierce competition from her fellow classmates. Then, he tells of an inner-city girl (Mexican, I think) who didn&rsquo;t even have a 4.0 GPA, wasen&rsquo;t really noted for much, but who, due to almost no competition at all, was the school&rsquo;s valedictorian. Some of the detaisl of the story may be a bit off but that&rsquo;s the gist of what he told us.</p>
