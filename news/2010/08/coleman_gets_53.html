<h1>Coleman Gets 53 Years; Judge Rejects Innocent Defense</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, July 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Knox County judge on Friday rejected the notion that the lone female suspect in a January 2007 torture slaying was a young innocent under the domination of brutal killers.</p>
<p>Instead, Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner deemed Vanessa Coleman, 22, a street-savvy woman in firm command of her actions and callously indifferent to the consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no question she was young,&#8221; Baumgartner said of a then-18-year-old Coleman. &#8220;But Ms. Coleman was not your typical 18-year-old who just graduated from high school.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This was a street-smart young lady. She made the decision to have a relationship with Mr. (Letalvis) Cobbins. She&rsquo;s the one who made the decision to come down to Tennessee. She&rsquo;s the one who made the decision to stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, Baumgartner turned aside Coleman&rsquo;s bid for leniency and ordered her to serve 53 years in prison. She will be eligible for parole after serving roughly a third of that term, but the families of victims Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23, vowed Friday to fight against any early release for the Kentucky native.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baumgartner told Coleman that she got all the leniency she was going to get from the Davidson County jury that in May acquitted her of any role in the crimes against Newsom and refused to assign her the same level of culpability for the crimes against Christian as that of her three male co-defendants. Instead, the panel convicted her of lesser charges as a &#8220;facilitator.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Assistant District Attorney General Leland Price countered that testimony showed Coleman knew her boyfriend, Letalvis Cobbins; his brother, Lemaricus Davidson; and Cobbins&rsquo; pal, George Thomas, left Davidson&rsquo;s Chipman Street house on the night of the couple&rsquo;s abduction with plans to pull off a heist of some sort.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was there and (already) saw the violence (ringleader) Lemaricus Davidson was capable of,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;She stayed. She had plenty of opportunity to get away and stop this crime. She didn&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davidson has been sentenced to death for his role as ringleader. Cobbins and Thomas are serving life without possibility of parole. A fifth suspect, Eric Boyd, has never been charged in the killings but is spending 18 years in federal prison as an accessory to the carjacking.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because Coleman was cleared in Newsom&rsquo;s death, his parents, Mary and Hugh Newsom, were not allowed to speak at Friday&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Channon Christian&rsquo;s mother], however, took direct aim at Coleman, reading entries Coleman made in a journal in which she characterized her time in Knoxville during the crime spree as &#8220;an adventure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you wanted souvenirs from your adventure,&#8221; Deena Christian said, referring to her daughter&rsquo;s belongings found in Coleman&rsquo;s possession. &#8220;That&rsquo;s sick.&#8221;</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;ll be out in her early 40s with more years to live on the &#8220;outside&#8221; than Channon and Christopher had in their entire life.  She deserves life, she is no more a facilitator than I am brain surgeon.  She was a participant who derived savage pleasure from torturing two white kids.</p>

		<p>Best news in this story is that the others are appealing, thus keeping the story alive in Knoxville.  Makes it harder for the lib professors at UT to convince students that &#8220;we need to do more to atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges&#8221;.</p>
<p>Students can respond with &#8220;What are you doing in your personally privileged life to help the African American community and Civil Rights leaders  convince black fathers to marry the mothers of dey babies and to convince that vibrant and authentic community to help police catch criminals?  Will you sign this petition demanding that we build more jails and prisons, and to bring Nicholas Stix to campus to teach us some Race Reality?&#8221;</p>

<p>And most tellingly, as the blogger A Race Against Time showed, Davidson led his criminal cohorts to kidnap, rape, and murder Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom only one day after Davidson&rsquo;s white girlfriend, Daphne Sutton, had left him, after his constant beatings. John Gill, a spokesman for District Attorney General Randy Nichols, had argued that because Davidson &amp; Co. &ldquo;socialized&rdquo; (read: had sex) with whites, that the crime could not have been racially motivated. That was pure sophistry, because authorities never permit whites&rsquo; sexual involvement with blacks to be used to exculpate them from charges of &ldquo;hate crimes&rdquo; against blacks, and because racist black men who are obsessed with having consensual sex with white women, are also obsessed with raping white women. </p>

		<p>This is one case where the judge tried to correct the incompetence of the jury.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a good analogy of the case:</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been following this crime for a long time, and I&rsquo;ve been haunted by the thought that what took place probably was worse than I can imagine. And the perpetrators doubtless think that in prison, supported by the taxpayers at great expense, they are &#8220;paying their debt to society.&#8221; I wonder who started that silly idea.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In 40 years, she might find the attitude of Americans and the life awaiting her such that she would have preferred to stay in prison.</p>
<p>I predict that the day she walks out of prison will be the last time she ever sees a white person.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t a crime that could ever be done by a human being with human emotions.  How could a group of people torture someone over this long a period of time, and not be taken ill?  There is an emotion at work here that whites cannot relate to.  We don&rsquo;t share it. </p>

<p>Of course she will, and she will still be of childbearing age. <br>
I sincerely hope that they sterilize her before they let her out from behind bars for 2 reasons. 1) An innocent baby should never be subjected to this female&rsquo;s tender, loving &#8220;care&#8221; and 2)With genetics and training like hers, what would that innocent baby grow up to do?</p>

		<p>I agree with #4 above - putting blacks like these in prison is no punishment at all - they get fed, clothed, no bills to pay, no work to do, learn new crime techniques, pump iron half the day and bully white prisoners the rest of the day, etc - an environment totally suited to them.</p>

I too have followed this sickening case. One of the most striking things about it has been the incessant lecturing by and through the media that race had nothing to do with the kidnapping, rape, and execution of these two young people. That was the official and only acceptable position from day one. </p>
<p>At the same time, we were told to believe that there WAS a racial component to the case: Those who dared mention that the people who committed these savage outrages and the victims of the outrages were of different races must be &#8220;white-supremacist&#8221; types. In short order, these horrid crimes committed by blacks against whites were turned into an indictment of racism among white people. </p>

		<p>I read about these horrible crimes several years ago right here on AmRen. I revisit them from time to time and am sickened every time for days on end. I remind my friends about this as a continual wakeup call for all of us anytime we are in the area of feral blacks. God help their families and damn the perps.<br>
