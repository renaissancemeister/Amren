			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Preston, New York Times, August 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security officials found that the woman [&#8220;L.R.&#8221;] had proved that she could not expect the Mexican authorities to protect her from the violence and murder threats of her attacker [her common-law husband], and that she could not safely relocate anywhere in the country to escape him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government and the courts never questioned the account L.R. gave of her treatment {snip}.</p>
<p>Asylum was also granted to L.R.&rsquo;s two sons, now 22 and 20 years old. {snip}<br>

		<p>Why do they have to ask for and be granted asylum in this country?  Why can&rsquo;t she move to another part of her own country instead of moving to ours?</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot.  Our government is going to give her benefits for life, and her kids too!</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe what I&rsquo;m reading.  I just can&rsquo;t.  Does Mexico take in White American women who&rsquo;ve been abused by their husbands because they can&rsquo;t find anywhere in America to hide???</p>

		<p> Why should we turn a Mexican domestic tragedy into an international one? I dislike the brutalization of women, but it is the norm in many Third World countries. Most of these unfortunate women are poor and illiterate  &mdash;  just the type of immigrants we need for our high tech/ competitive economy? Let&rsquo;s face it our country is bankrupt and heading to the bottom. We can&rsquo;t afford to be the world&rsquo;s sugar daddy anymore. </p>

		<p>So she&rsquo;s safe now from her abusive Mexican husband because she&rsquo;s on the other side of a border that&rsquo;s proven to be no big deterrent to Mexicans?  </p>
<p>Only Homeland Security could make sense of that&hellip;..</p>

		<p>&#8220;Setting a precedent?&#8221;  Are you kidding?  Here in El Paso, the so called &#8220;domestic violence&#8221; shelter is packed with Mexican women who show up with their kids and claim they are victims of domestic violence blah blah blah, so they get their papers, welfare, food stamps, WICC, DICC, whatever and all the usual welfare state handouts, and badda bing! - more voters for the Communist Party. This has been going on for years.</p>
<p>Is this a great country OR WHAT???!!!</p>

		<p>No where in the NYT article does it mention the word &#8220;illegal,&#8221; although it is apparent she is.  Do they think her hsband cnnot find her in the U.S?  And why give asylum to her grown sons?</p>

Why did she come to the United States? Why didn&rsquo;t she go to any of the spanisih speaking South American countries? Is she seeking the protection that can only be found in a racist, white nation?</p>

<p>As if this precedent-setting decision isn&rsquo;t bad enough, everybody please note that the abusive Mexican Macho Man in question is only her COMMON-LAW &#8220;husband&#8221;. She isn&rsquo;t even married to the guy! A violent man to whom a woman is legally yoked may be hard for her to hide from   &mdash;   but this guy was merely her BOYFRIEND! How hard is it to evade a boyfriend? </p>
<p>Geographically, Mexico is a huge country. If this senorita can&rsquo;t figure out a way to get away from a tormentor in a territory the size of Mexico, then she&rsquo;s too dim-witted to be let into the US. </p>
<p>Not that the US would have ANY responsibility for her wellbeing even if she were a genius. </p>

		<p>What is to prevent her husband from crossing the border and killing her HERE?  After all, it&rsquo;s quite easy to do; millions of others have sneaked across, successfully, before him.  What&rsquo;s to stop him?</p>
<p>And giving asylum to her two GROWN SONS too? Are they also in danger?  Can&rsquo;t they protect their mother?  ( Btw, are they this man&rsquo;s children?)</p>
<p>I thought that &#8220;asylum&#8221; used to be granted for POLITICAL reasons, and only rarely. Now it&rsquo;s given even to  people who don&rsquo;t get along with their spouses?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s a schoolteacher?  Is she competent in English? What does she teach?  Wouldn&rsquo;t she do better teaching school in some other Spanish-speaking country?  Why here? (Has she been earning a living while here?)  </p>
<p>A great many questions are unanswered in this very inadequate story. Just another sob story to drum up sympathy for these people with their wonderful &#8220;family values&#8221; (choke, choke!!!) who are &#8220;only seeking a better life&#8221;.</p>

I don&rsquo;t care what anyone thinks, secession is the only answer anymore. White liberals continue to take us down the path of racial suicide at an ever alarming pace. Individual states need to start withholding tax dollars from the feds. and making their own laws. </p>

		<p>Yeah right. Of course there is no way her husband can illegally enter the USA and get her, after all it would be impossible for him cross our southern border, it&rsquo;s so good at keeping Mexicans out.</p>
