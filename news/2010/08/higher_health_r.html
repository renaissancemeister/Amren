<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38761177/ns/health-more_health_news/">Higher Health Risks for Blacks Who Donate Kidney</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gene Emery, MSNBC, August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Blacks who donate one of their kidneys have a higher risk of high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney disease compared to white donors, doctors reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The findings in the New England Journal of Medicine mean doctors need to pay more attention to the health of donors, said the team, led by Dr. Krista Lentine of the Saint Louis University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not proposing any change to donor selection policy based on these data, and do not believe that race and ethnicity should be used to discourage anyone from stepping forward for potential donor evaluation,&#8221; she said in a e-mail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The average waiting time for a kidney is 1,121 days, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. More than 91,000 Americans are waiting for a kidney and non-whites are less likely to get a good match for transplant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Compared to whites, black donors were 52 percent more likely to develop high blood pressure, and more than twice as likely to develop chronic kidney disease or diabetes requiring drug therapy.</p>
<p>But such problems are already more common in the black community for a variety of possible reasons, such as having less access to health care.</p>
<p>Blacks make up 34 percent of the people awaiting a kidney transplant, Lentine said.</p>
<p>The risks were similar for Hispanic donors, who make up 18 percent of the population who need a donated kidney, the researchers said.</p>

		<p>Okay, so here we have another piece of liberal claptrap.  Blacks are of course more at risk for these conditions because of genetics and lifestyle, which the writer leaves unmentioned.  The major blame is apparently supposed to be &#8220;less access to health care&#8221;.  HUH?  Who in the U.S. cannot find a physician, in a free clinic if needed, who will prescribe medication for hypertension, kidney failure, or any other disease common to blacks?  Many such drugs are available for $4, and, if dialysis becomes necessary, the government picks up the tab.  </p>

		<p><i>But such problems are already more common in the black community for a variety of possible reasons, such as having less access to health care.</i></p>
<p>This is a typical bit of left wing nonsense.  Type II diabetes (the most prevalent kind) is not caused by a lack of access to health care.  Among poor third worlders on a traditional diet it is a very rare disease.  It is caused by excessive intake of sugary, high glycemic food.  There are far too many double wide Americans of all races but obesity is particularly prevalent among blacks.  So it is unsurprising that American blacks have a high rate of diabetes.  They don&rsquo;t need more subsidized health care, they need to eat more vegetables and less junk.<br>

		<p>Different groups may experience different tendencies towards <i>&#8220;high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney disease&#8221;</i> but those diseases are generally caused or exacerbated by poor diet and lack of exercise. I wish reporters would stop using <i>&#8220;access to health care&#8221;</i> as an excuse for irresponsible behavior.</p>

		<p>Some of these black health problems have to be related to Vitamin D. In a survey by the Cleveland Clinic every person tested was low in vitamin D, regardless of age or group. Because of their darker skin, blacks are more suseptable to Vitamin D deficiencies. I have known quite a few blacks with kidney problems, caused by high blood pressure. A simple pill could correct much of this.<br>
This is something Madame Michelle could work on.</p>

		<p>So&hellip; perhaps it&rsquo;s a good thing after all that blacks are so disinclined to add their name to the organ donor registry.</p>
