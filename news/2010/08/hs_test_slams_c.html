<h1>HS Test &#8216;Slams&rsquo; Christianity, Lauds Islam</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yoav Gonen, New York Post, August 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State testmakers played favorites when quizzing high-schoolers on world religions  &mdash;  giving Islam and Buddhism the kid-gloves treatment while socking it to Christianity, critics say.</p>
<p>Teachers complain that the reading selections from the Regents exam in global history and geography given last week featured glowing passages pertaining to Muslim society but much more critical essay excerpts on the subject of Christianity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most troubling passage came from Daniel Roselle&rsquo;s &#8220;A World History: A Cultural Approach,&#8221; observers said.</p>
<p>The passage reads: &#8220;Wherever they went, the Moslems [sic] brought with them their love of art, beauty and learning. From about the eighth to the eleventh century, their culture was superior in many ways to that of western Christendom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an excerpt listing the common procedures used by Christian friars to introduce the religion in Latin America stated that &#8220;idols, temples and other material evidences of paganism [were] destroyed,&#8221; and &#8220;Christian buildings [were] often constructed on sites of destroyed native temples&#8221;  &mdash;  and built with free Indian labor, to boot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see why some people might see these questions as skewed,&#8221; said Mark MacWilliams, a religious-studies professor at St. Lawrence University in upstate Canton. &#8220;Why does the exam seem to have only documents that portray Islam as a religion of peace, civilization and refinement, while it includes documents about Christianity that show it was anything but peaceful in the Spanish conquest of the Americas?&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a Christian (I&rsquo;m Asatru), but it doesn&rsquo;t take any great perception to see that these institutionalized attacks on Christianity are really thinly veiled attacks on Western civilization itself.  That&rsquo;s why Christianity gets the sneers from governmedia and academia.</p>
<p>The real irony is that today&rsquo;s Christianity is little more than a pale, wimpy, submissive, self-hating shadow of its former self.  It&rsquo;s more often an enthusiastic supporter of the PC madness than an obstacle.  I guess the Marxists, like vampires, just can&rsquo;t bear the sight of a cross.</p>

		<p>Blaak Obongo&rsquo;s post (#1) is absolutely correct! I&rsquo;ve been an adherent of Christian Identity for many years now, but have not been able to find any locals who share my views. Hoping I might find some white people of good character I ventured into an evangelical church a few weeks ago. The first time I&rsquo;d been to one in several years. The people I met had more hatred for this country and the white race than committed liberal atheists I know.</p>

		<p>I am  Christian but not the type we see and hear in the churches today. It is their own fault that this happening. Theirs and their preachers and priests who have all caved in to the PC doctrines of the world. Tolerance and misguided altruism will kill any religion.</p>
<p> They preach nothing but love &#8220;of others&#8221;, everyone is &#8220;our brother&#8221;, forgive your enemies, respect all religions, never be angry always be nice, even to your people&rsquo;s enemies, bring in your enemy as &#8220;refugees&#8221; adopt third world kids and feed the whole 3rd world (so they can keep procreating even more hungry mouths) and the list goes on and on. </p>
<p>How can ANY people survive believing all this hogwash? You can bet Christians of the past would never be so naive or gullible as today&rsquo;s Christians are. Christianity used to be a protector of one&rsquo;s people. It no longer is, it has been bastardized to the point of no return. Think the REAL God likes what HE sees? I don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I am not a Christian either but I grew up in the faith and I know how much good Christianity has done over the millennia. It is sad and frustrating that both the media and the educational system seems to focus on the negative.  It seems that appreciation of diversity means the appreciation of everyone EXCEPT White Christians. And as a Pagan, most Christians would accept me. Most Muslims would not. I am not &#8220;of the Book&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Islam is a leftists dream.  They would gladly live in a world of Sharia if it meant the destruction of Western Civilization.  That is what people must grasp.  Massive muslim immigration, as has happened in Europe, is the key to what leftists crave.  These people must be treated like the enemy they are.  Westerners that support and promote Islam at every turn are trying to destroy us.  </p>

		<p>It is so very sad to see what has happened to Christianity in the past few decades. I was born and raised Catholic and have always loved the church but there came a point where I could not attend services or listen to any of the leaders of the church anymore. There is for the average person only 1 hour a week where their attention is focused on God and the leaders of the various churches have perverted these times to their political and P.C. ends. At one point I had stopped going to mass every sunday because of the constant vilification of South Africa while it was still a white run country. Instead of fostering love of God and country the church was making me more and more angry until I stopped going. I again felt badly about not attending services several years later and stopped in for a late night mass and was greeted at the door by a third world african priest. His entire homily was about how bad the western white world was and how much it owed non-whites. I have never attended services since. The pope and the bishops are cowards and will not even stand up for the faith they profess to serve and believe in. The evangelical churches are not any better. My love for God and His Christ remain in my heart and this is the part of me that will never waver but the christian organizations have become nothing more than P.C. infested disinformation nonentities full of traitors that any rational thinking person will choose to ignore. Christianity is not the problem. The problem lies with those who are running these organizations. Want to make a difference? Refuse to give money to any of them and see how their attitudes will change.</p>

<p>To the contrary, I think you are wrong.  I think they are wrong, too. Very wrong!  If they got their &#8220;dream&#8221;, as you call it, it would soon turn out to be their worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;liberals&#8221; you speak of are doubtless used to doing very much as they please and having a huge amount of personal freedom in their lives. They are not accustomed to being dictated to or monitored by anybody.  </p>
<p>They could not tolerate being restricted in every tiny aspect of their daily lives.  And Islam would not for long tolerate THEM,  either! <br>
   <br>
Islam is not patient with people addicted to freedom-loving ways. Liberals love their freedom, while Islam has no respect for notions like freedom.  Nor is Islam gentle with its punishments.  Something would have to give.   And it wouldn&rsquo;t be pretty.<br>

<p>Big mistake (as you found out, I&rsquo;m sure). Evangelicals these days are the most sniviling little creeps you could find. I suggest you try a more traditional church, like Lutheran or Episcopalian. Even though they too hold liberal views, officially, at least it usually doesn;t show in their services. And usually there&rsquo;s like one token black and that&rsquo;s it. Evangelical churches are always preaching liberal views on race, and their churches are usually filled to the brim with blacks, Hispanics, Asians, mulattoes, and the lowest class whites. Of course, there was a time when this musen&rsquo;t have been so. After all, Baptist preachers in the 1800&rsquo;s ardently defended Southern social values, using biblical excerpts to support their views. And let&rsquo;s not forget the old Dutch Reformed back in the days of Apartheid. Now those people knew what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Back on topic, as a high school student, I can verify that without a doubt, the stuff this article says is entirely true. Christianity is nothing but demonized in the textbooks (even though most teachers don&rsquo;t agree with this anti-Christian rubbish, they still have to teach it), and other religions, especially Islam, are lifted up as peaceful, brilliant, intuitive, accepting, blah blah blah. Our ancesters would never tolerate such nonsense. But, unfortunately, the world we live in today is not the world it was before, the world it should be.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the same reality Europeans face every day. Marxists, liberals and islamists work together to destroy what is left of the Christian heritage in Europe. Schools here use to celebrate the end of both the spring and fall semester in church. Not allowed anymore. However are homosexuals allowed to get married in church nowadays. Almost all history/religion books in school are about the kind moslems that were attacked by the vicious Christians and of course slavery is only white owning blacks. Not a single word about   who started the organized slave trade(a invention from the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;, Islam).  </p>

		<p>As many of those whom posted above, I am not a Christian.  I do not agree with the concept of faith: unprovable doctrine.  I do not belittle those of faith, so I would appreciate a similar consideration; however, such consideration is rarely received by me or my fellow non-believers.  Having stated my preamble, I must say that whomever considers Islam to be a religion of peace is an absolute fool.  Islam is a religion of the sword-it has always been such.  Christianity&rsquo;s response to islamic incursions have been just that: responses.  Islam has received only those punishments it rightly deserved.</p>

<p>Poster # 4&hellip;.. read posts 1,2 and 3. That will tell you why Christianity today is falling. They preach for the &#8220;world&#8221; and promote the kind of inclusiveness that will destroy the White race.</p>
<p> Go into any church and try to tell these White Christians what is printed here on Amren or about black on White crime, and the comments here and they will shun you like you are a space alien. The shouts of racism will fill the air.</p>
<p>  Christianity today does NOT appreciate White people, they promote &#8220;diversity&#8221; at every turn, but will sure take YOUR money to send more missionaries to Africa and to feed the 3rd world. </p>
<p> That word &#8220;diversity&#8221; is ANTI-Christian to begin with! Please show us where &#8220;tolerance and diversity&#8221; (and stupidity) is the foundation of Christianity.  </p>

		<p>European Whites fought in the Crusades(root word &#8220;cross&#8221;) against the Muslims to save the Holy lands of Jerusalem, well&hellip; the ones that actually made it there at least.</p>
<p>Now we have the Muslims inundating Western lands in Crescades (root word &#8220;crescent&#8221;), if I may coin a term, imposing their laws and mores onto us.</p>

<p><br>
Absolutely.  A very perceptive comment. <br>
 <br>
And the reason why is that is is very easy to attack, because Christianity  (once synonymous with Western civilization) has become so passive, so self-hating, and even apologetic, that it doesn&rsquo;t fight back.  It&rsquo;s masochistic.  It invites this treatment.</p>
<p>Islam would never tolerate such criticm or attacks. So no one dares attack it. They know better. But Christianity invites them.</p>

<p>Sorry poster #9 but those two churches are also very liberal and the Lutheran church is behind the importation of all these Africans, Somalis, etc. Same with the Catholic church. As for the Episcopalian church they now have homosexual and lesbian &#8220;bishops&rsquo; not to mention their liberal stance on immigration. I have not found ONE &#8220;Christian&#8221; church in my city that I would attend or give money to.</p>
<p> They all preach the same PC garbage and Christian radio is terrible!  Listen to it sometime.  ALWAYS money for all these 3rd world peoples and &#8220;converting&#8221; them and muslims to their form of &#8220;Christianity&#8221;.. Today it was for wind up radios (send $30 or more) to all these muslims in their native country so they can listen to &#8220;Christian radio&#8221; and come to Christ&hellip;Then to seal the deal, they had &#8220;so-called real stories&#8221; from &#8220;real muslims&#8221; who have &#8220;converted&#8221; to back up their scam. </p>

		<p>Islam is more than a religion, it is a total life system. The more their numbers increase, the more they demand, and given that diversity is considered the be-all-end-all, they will get more things their way. Look at what is happening in England, and Europe.</p>
<p>They do not believe in separation of church and state. To them it is a total package.</p>
<p>The First Amendment could be our ending. Because of it, we cannot have a official not welcome policy for Islam.</p>

<p>Answer: Religious, racial and ethnic interest groups have be given de facto veto power over the content of tests and textbooks used in government schools. From NYT research professor Diane Ravitch&rsquo;s THE LANGUAGE POLICE: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn (2003):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;world history textbooks consistently shade or omit facts that might offend any racial, ethnic, or religious group.  This does not occur by happenstance.  Most of the books prominently identify an advisory board that includes representatives of religious and ethnic groups.  Three publishers  &mdash;  Glencoe, Houghton-Mifflin, and Prentice-Hall  &mdash;  rely on the same individual from the Council on Islamic Education to review their Islamic content.  This may account for the similarity of their material on Islam as well as their omission of anything that would enable students to understand conflicts between Islamic fundamentalism and Western liberalism.  Some textbooks have multicultural advisory committees that include representatives of Jewish, Ukranian-American, Native-American, Asian American, and Afrocentric organizations.  Publishers that invite representatives of religious and ethnic groups to review their materials before publication are practicing self-censorship.&rdquo;  p147</p>
<p>THE LANGUAGE POLICE is essential to understanding why public schools cannot teach history and literature.</p>

<p>Look at the situation RIGHT NOW in Kra. Peninsula that connects Siam with Malaya. Muslims killing Buddhists right and left. And the mentality of the depraved at work too.

<p>The following passage refers to professing Christians, and it describes very well what we are seeing more and more nowadays. </p>
<p>II TImothy 3:1-5 &mdash; &#8221;This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. / For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, / Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, / Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; / Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.&#8221; </p>

		<p>There are some excellent posts here. I am involved with the church and i face the same problems. To criticise diversity, 3rd world immigration, black baby adoptions and the general concept of the brotherhood and equality of man is to invite adverse comments of being un-Christian, racist, nazi, bigot etc. We have churches preaching the Marxist PC, AA Loony Left agenda because it is &#8220;Christian&#8221;! We then have some Churches inviting Islamic clerics to speak to us in the interests of mutual understanding, oh deary dear&hellip;.</p>
<p>Again, America and the western world, just wake up and observe what is happening to the society we all once knew.</p>

		<p><i>Meanwhile, an excerpt listing the common procedures used by Christian friars to introduce the religion in Latin America stated that &ldquo;idols, temples and other material evidences of paganism [were] destroyed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christian buildings [were] often constructed on sites of destroyed native temples&rdquo; &mdash; and built with free Indian labor, to boot.</i></p>
<p>That may be true in large part, but it is no worse than what Muslims did to every one of the numerous Christian countries that they conquered.  Egypt was once a Christian country.  Turkey was once the seat of Eastern Christianity.  They are Islamic today because of conquest and forced conversions, not because of the compelling arguments of Islamic missionaries.<br>

		<p> Read &#8220;The Art of Worldly Wisdom,&#8221;  written by the Spanish Jesuit priest, Balthasar Gracián, and then you will see how far Christianity has fallen as a font of wisdom.</p>
<p> Read also &#8220;Christianity and Liberalism,&#8221; by J. Gresham Machen to see how easily the meanings of Christian doctrines were hollowed-out by the word-termites of liberalism. </p>
<p>True Christianity is a life-giving stream, flowing across the solid rocks of reality. Those who know reality will drink from it. </p>

<p>Yep&hellip;just like a petulant child claiming to hate (untasted) beets or Brussels sprouts. And while they will profess to backing Islam, or anything else anti-West, they do not see themselves in the position of the Viet Cong. Nor do they remember the hosing of a lifetime the VC took, after the North Vietnamese Army took over.</p>

		<p>The First Crusade was a military expedition from 1096 to 1099 by Western Christianity to regain the Holy Lands taken in the Muslim conquest of the Levant, ultimately resulting in the recapture of Jerusalem. It was launched in 1095 by Pope Urban II with the primary goal of responding to an appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who requested that western volunteers come to his aid and help to repel the invading Seljuk Turks from Anatolia. An additional goal soon became the principal objective &mdash; the Christian reconquest of the sacred city of Jerusalem and the Holy Land and the freeing of the Eastern Christians from Islamic rule.</p>

<p>Actually, in historical terms, that&rsquo;s probably accurate. What&rsquo;s interesting is what happened next in &ldquo;western Christendom&rdquo;: the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, increased opportunities for women, all of which bypassed Islam. But as a standalone sentence, I can&rsquo;t argue with it.</p>

		<p>    Where is the Muslim equivalent of Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms ? Michael Angelo, Galileo, Louis Pasteur, Madame Curie ? Joan of Arc ? If they were so benevolent and forward thinking a thousand years ago, why are they not now ? Most of their philosophers built on Aristotle . If they are indeed such movers and shakers, then why did they have to be yanked out of their Medieval existence after WW2 ?  Muslims are usurpers, always have been, always will be . Mohammed himself, piggy backed his upstart malevolent, political ideology disguised as a religion onto Judaism and Christianity to begin with to give it validity . Shamelessly claiming many of their Jewish prophets as their own .  But when have you known Muslims to take a benevolent view of any Jew ? Almost all alleged Muslim accomplishments were usurped one way or the other . Usually by conquest of such great civilizations as Persia, Egypt, the Byzantines . The Byzantines are where the Muslims obtained their architecture  . The domes and spires ? They were representative of Byzantine churches . That their people once produced remarkable civilizations is undeniable, but that was all before Islam . Find yourself a copy of,&#8221;The politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades .&#8221; It will open your eyes to the truth about Muslims .       </p>

		<p>Even if that description is accruate it means Islam was superior to Christianity from the 8th to the 11th century.</p>

		<p>Why then do the current day Muslims live in squalor, poverty, confusion, ignorance and idolatry? They appear to perpetuate 7th century imperialism and viciousness in their conquest to rule the earth. Definitely not a way to win favor of others to their philosophy. I see them as ancient clannish evil bent warriors, clothed in 21st century technology. History is not to be repeated in most cases but in the case of Islam, if there is a tad of truth to quotes prior to mine, might not be to bad to repeat.</p>

		<p>As Luther wrote:  &ldquo;From about the eighth to the eleventh century, their [Islamic] culture was superior in many ways to that of  <i>Western Christendom.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agree with Luther on the message of that single sentence. But what is never considered (by those who love to make that claim) is that their &#8220;superior culture&#8221; was what Islam had appropriated, conquered, stolen from its immediate predecessors in the lands around the Mediterranean. They took it by force.  Islam had conquered and absorbed <i>Eastern Christendom.</i> That culture, the dying gasp of the Classical world, was still alive and flickered on for a few more centuries before sputtering out&hellip; not BECAUSE of Islam but DESPITE it. </p>
<p>Islam does not create innovation or encourage originality. It discourages questioning, which is the basis of rational scientific thought and progress. Islam is oppressive and stultifying, emphazing conformity, acceptance, and mindless obedience.</p>
<p>Islam did not create that high culture; Islam only destroyed it.</p>
