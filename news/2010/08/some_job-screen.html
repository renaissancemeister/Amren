<h1>Some Job-Screening Tactics Challenged As Illegal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Hananel, Google News, August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Companies using criminal records or bad credit reports to screen out job applicants might run afoul of anti-discrimination laws as the government steps up scrutiny of hiring policies that can hurt blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>A blanket refusal to hire workers based on criminal records or credit problems can be illegal if it has a disparate impact on racial minorities, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The agency enforces the nation&rsquo;s employment discrimination laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our sense is that the problem is snowballing because of the technology allowing these checks to be done with a fair amount of ease,&#8221; said Carol Miaskoff, assistant legal counsel at the EEOC.</p>
<p>With millions of adults having criminal records  &mdash;  anything from underage drinking to homicide  &mdash;  a growing number of job seekers are having a rough time finding work. And more companies are trying to screen out people with bankruptcies, court judgments or other credit problems just as those numbers have swollen during the recession.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justice Department statistics show that 38 percent of the U.S. prison population is black, compared with about 12 percent of the general population. In 2008, African-Americans were about six times more likely to be incarcerated than whites. The incarceration rate for Latinos was 2.3 times higher than whites.</p>
<p>If criminal histories are taken into account, the EEOC says employers must also consider the nature of the job, the seriousness of the offense and how long ago it occurred. For example, it may make sense to disqualify a bank employee with a past conviction for embezzlement, but not necessarily for a DUI.</p>
<p>Most companies tend to be more nuanced when they look at credit reports, weeding out those applicants with bad credit only if they seek senior positions or jobs dealing with money. But if the screening process weeds out more black and Hispanic applicants than whites, an employer needs to show how the credit information is related to the job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last fall, the EEOC sent a strong message to employers when it filed a class-action lawsuit against Freeman Companies, a Dallas-based events planning firm, alleging the company discriminated against blacks, Hispanics and males by rejecting job seekers based on credit history and criminal records. Freeman has denied the charges.</p>
<p>The growth of online databases and a multimillion dollar background check industry have made it easy for employers to find out reams of information about potential hires. Companies see the checks as another way to weed out unsavory candidates, keep a safe work environment and prevent negligent hiring claims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ariela Migdal, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Rights Project in New York, said a person might have a blemish that has nothing to do with the job he or she is seeking. And records sometimes are inaccurate or not updated to reflect that someone arrested later had charges dropped or a conviction overturned or expunged, she said.</p>

		<p>Oh dear!  Weeding out criminals during hiring will have a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on blacks and Mexicans!  Well, since we certainly can&rsquo;t be so Racist as to suggest they stop committing so many crimes, I guess it&rsquo;s time for our Supreme Soviet to &#8220;step up scrutiny&#8221; and make sure the maximum number of Felons of Color are admitted into the workforce.</p>
<p>Surely even liberals can&rsquo;t be so utterly brainless as to swallow this farce with a straight face.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Not hiring people with criminal records or bad credit discriminates against blacks and Hispanics.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that both the above groups have criminal records and bad credit above the national average, I wasn&rsquo;t aware that it was discrimination to take those things into consideration in matters of money, reliability and security.</p>
<p>Of course, this just goes to show how racist my thoughts are and that I&rsquo;m in desperate need of re-education at a Gulag, run by the brilliant intellect and model of sanity, Cass Sunstein.  <br>

		<p>This government is so non-reality oriented.  Everything is thrown under the umbrella of racial discrimination.  This government created and allowed the subprime mess now they are forcing employers to put up with undesirable employees.  DUI also means drinking on the job, does it not?  Serving jail time and bad credit ratings equal being irresponsible and bad judgment does it not?  Why should the employer not have the liberty to hire good employees?  This country has continued to slip backwards due to &#8220;civil rights&#8221;.  It is interesting that the government need to force Hispanics and blacks on employers but not whites and Asians.</p>

		<p>I have heard that the best way to prevent renting to blacks is to do a credit check, since blacks and bad credit go together like pretzels and beer.  Now watch all these alphabet-soup agencies scream about that too.</p>

		<p>The main flaw in this logic is that the only kind of criminal convictions employers are allowed to ask potential or current employees about is adult felony convictions.  That is allowed in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Can&rsquo;t ask about juvenile rap sheets, can&rsquo;t ask about arrests, can&rsquo;t ask about misdemeanors.  Therefore, most people with only a minor criminal history aren&rsquo;t affected here.  </p>

		<p>The REAL objective is to make it a hate crime to NOT rent to, loan to, give a job to etc.etc if a person is black or brown. This is all to hurt the Whites in this country and to move them all in right next to you. They will even get free home loans, wait and see. </p>
<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget about the new thing now is to blame White racists when they (blacks and browns) commit crimes, so it will impossible to jail them or try them in our &#8220;justice&#8221; system. Only Whites will go to jail or end up dead. </p>

		<p>The tyranny of the Federal Government increases every day and this is just the latest example.  I can envision a scenario within the next 20 years in which the local apparatchik will just assign minority employees to businesses.  The &#8220;owner&#8221; will have no power to refuse lest he be hauled in front of a fairness committee and threatened with re-education if he doesn&rsquo;t comply.</p>

		<p>It might be a good idea to revisit the myth of lending discrimination perpetrated by the Boston Fed in 1992. The Boston Fed&rsquo;s study gave impetus to the attack on lending standards that produced the subprime mortgage meltdown.</p>
<p>The 1992 Boston Fed study   &mdash;  - which the media latched onto with the same tenacity that the New York Times latched onto the &#8220;guilt&#8221; of the accused in the Duke lacrosse rape hoax   &mdash;  - was debunked by FOUR separate teams of researchers   &mdash;  - all to no avail. Here is just one of those studies disproving the Boston Fed&rsquo;s claims: </p>
<p>1998 - October - Economists Stan L. Liebowitz and Theodore Day investigate the 1992 Boston Fed study suggesting racism in the mortgage market. They are &ldquo;shocked at the poor quality&rdquo; of the the data: </p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;When we attempted to conduct a statistical analysis removing the impact of &hellip; obvious data errors, we found that the evidence of discrimination vanished. Without discrimination there would be no reason to try to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; the mortgage market. Nevertheless, our work largely evaporated down the memory hole as government regulators got busy putting the results of the Boston Fed study to use in creating policy. That policy, simply put, was to weaken underwriting standards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two economists prophetically warn: Bad loans today will mean dispossessed minorities tomorrow: </p>
<p>&ldquo;After the warm and fuzzy glow of &lsquo;flexible underwriting standards&rsquo; has worn off, we may discover that they are nothing more than standards that led to bad loans &hellip; If this is the case, current policy will not have helped its intended beneficiaries if in future years they are dispossessed from their homes due to an inability to make their mortgage payments.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>Blacks and mestizos disproportionately commit felonies, therefore, felonies are RACIST.</p>
<p>Criminals are overwhelmingly black and mestizo, therefore, the criminal justice system is RACIST.</p>
<p>These claims of racism really make me laugh, because it&rsquo;s an implicit recognition of the negative qualities of blacks and mestizos  &mdash;   the egalitarians just don&rsquo;t realize it. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get it, White Man?  EVERYTHING is racist unless it gives free welfare, housing, health care, or jobs to non-Whites.</p>

		<p>What I read between the lines here is that these practices will become scrutinized if they are applied to minorities.  So it will be yet another case where the only people this practice filters will be white.  This means that the American workplace will consist of only pure, crime-free whites and minorities of any legal status possible.  Sure it&rsquo;s easy to say &#8220;screw&rsquo;em they were criminals&#8221; or &#8220;screw&rsquo;em since their credit is in the 300&rsquo;s&#8221;, but we should consider who these white people are.  I&rsquo;d wager that more white people turn their lives around than any other race when they have fallen from favor.  Black people and other minorities wear their criminal record like a badge of honor.  In decades I have only seen white people act like they were ashamed when they ended up in jail or bankrupt.  All of the minorities I have known in the same circumstances blamed someone else.<br>

<p>Of course, we always forget (in the Disneyland of multiculturalism) that a white woman &ldquo;should&rdquo; be raped by nonwhites 90% of the time and a white man &ldquo;must be&rdquo; 100% of the time murdered by these invaders and interlopers, via the abysmal and enraptured hypocrisy of &ldquo;tolerant&rdquo; Marxism and euphoric stupidity. Is that why they get executed 75% of the time, or is it &ldquo;racism?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Discrimination is only illegitimate if it is based on race alone.  If it is based on qualities that correlate with race, like felony convictions and low scores on mental aptitude tests, it is appropriate.  </p>

		<blockquote>With millions of adults having criminal records &mdash; anything from underage drinking to homicide</blockquote>
<p>Employers don&rsquo;t give a whit about misdemeanors like underage drinking. Out of all the job applications I&rsquo;ve filled out in my life, only one has asked about misdemeanor convictions, and the place hired me anyway, even though I was honest with them and told them that I had several from the days of my misspent youth. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re presenting a false dilemma, here. This is an attempt to bamboozle law-abiding whites into thinking that employers must be forced to hire violent recidivist felons, or they&rsquo;ll lose their jobs because of a minor drunk &amp; disorderly charge from when they were nineteen. </p>
<blockquote>The main flaw in this logic is that the only kind of criminal convictions employers are allowed to ask potential or current employees about is adult felony convictions.

<p>I&rsquo;m not too sure about that. Like I posted above, I&rsquo;ve been asked about misdemeanors, but the place hired me anyway, even though I told them I had several. Employers know the score. </p>

		<p>As for the statement, &ldquo;Not hiring people with criminal records or bad credit discriminates against blacks and Hispanics.&rdquo;, the application of simple logic demonstrates that statement equal to saying, &#8220;Blacks and Hispanics have a much greater tendency to crime and irresponsible behavior than Whites and Asians.&#8221; That is something you more expect to hear from a person dressed in a white sheet than from the EEOC. </p>
<p>So now the EEOC admits, in as many words, that blacks are &#8220;no damn good,&#8221; but it is discrimination to fail to ignore that conclusion? What&rsquo;s up with that? Common sense has left the building.</p>

SO TRUE!<br>
It is clear that the &#8220;civil Rights Movement is a runaway train (has been for decades, by design), and it is on a Kamakaze mission to utterly, completely pulverize all whiteness, period.<br>
No business power. No votes. No right to self defense. No legal reourse, or rights whatever. Nowhere to live as whites. No freedom of speech, or even private conversation.<br>
Can anyone disagree?<br>
The marxist white haters, and the browns aim to literally wipe real whites off the face of the earth. In their pea-brains, even these vile infants know that many real whites will be pushed right up to the wall, so long as the carrot of keeping a job, a pension, the hopes of that new SUV are still there.<br>
Will the worm turn, or be crushed? The irony, as I have put it before, is that Libtards and diversitards are themeselves totally effete, weak, spineless jellyfish, and can do no violence, for they are with out muscle, courage or moral character. <br>
They want the browns to beat us down, but the browns have neither the muscle or the brains to EVER do it. Only so long as whites chase around like panzies, jumping at illusory  or short-term security, can the Marxists/Browns control us. Should the day ever come when this worm turns, the world will change overnight. There are signs, but most whites just want to wait for the economy to get better&hellip;that&rsquo;s the ultimate tranquilizer for whites. &#8220;Maybe things will get better, and I can get that house out there in whiteville&gt;&#8221; Dream on, sleepwalkers.</p>

		<p>Anyone who has gone through the usual present-day process of getting a mortgage or any kind of loan knows that numbers control the process.  The money black people have is just as green as white people&rsquo;s, so, in the normal course of business,  lenders don&rsquo;t decline blacks just because they hate them as a group and want to hurt them.  If percentages and statistics indicate that a loan should be made, it will be  &mdash;  unless the government steps in and demands that loans be made to blacks regardless of whether they have a half-decent credit history or even an income.  Most whites wouldn&rsquo;t take out a mortgage if they knew they would have absolutely no money to make monthly payments, yet some blacks did  &mdash;  assuming, I suppose, that whitey would somehow bail them out.  Too many blacks simply take whatever is offered or available to them, with no thought to future problems that may arise.  </p>

		<p>To the victims of crime, rape, murder, robbery, home invasion, there lies the disparate impact. There must be consequences for violent crime besides the few years in jail with their friends and relatives that taxpayers pay for criminals.

		<p>Madison Grant puts forth an utterly splendid idea!  The DC police should post on their website the names, pictures, and phone numbers of all black sexual offenders, burglars, armed robbers, and child molesters so that all members of the congress and their families can avail themselves of their services as nannies, baby-sitters, cooks, and housekeepers.

		<p>Length of time since the offense should be taken into consideration too. Also since poor credit may disqualify a person from employment I would have a problem with people who have gone through a period of unemployment or other life changing event where credit has taken a hit. If someone has been out of work for months it goes without saying that his or her credit has been hit in one way or another. It has been my experience (have not worked since 2007 since I am staying home with my daughter) that the only jobs that require a credit check are those in the banking industry or those that require working with large sums of money in an independent function. </p>

		<p>Putting aside the issue of credit for a moment, everyone here knows that men are more likely to have criminal records than women. It is therefore &#8220;sexist&#8221; to use these records in the course of screening job applicants? Of course not!! Why? Because we&rsquo;re talking about a form of &#8216;desperate impact&rsquo; that affects males. And leftists are uninterested in that because it doesn&rsquo;t fit with their narrative about how whites in general and white males in particular have rigged the system to the disadvantage of blacks, browns and &#8216;women&rsquo; everywhere. </p>

		<p>Another point to be considered is this: what right does the EEOC have to dictate to businesses who they can hire? I thought America was supposed to have a free enterprise/free market system. This gets to one more agenda of the civil rites (intended spelling!) movement: to destroy the market economy and bring businesses under the purview of the federal government.  </p>
