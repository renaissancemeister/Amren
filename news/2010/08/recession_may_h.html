<h1>Recession May Have Pushed US Birth Rate to New Low</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marilynn Marchione, Google News, August 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. birth rate has dropped for the second year in a row, and experts think the wrenching recession led many people to put off having children. The 2009 birth rate also set a record: lowest in a century.</p>
<p>Births fell 2.6 percent last year even as the population grew, numbers released Friday by the National Center for Health Statistics show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The birth rate, which takes into account changes in the population, fell to 13.5 births for every 1,000 people last year. That&rsquo;s down from 14.3 in 2007 and way down from 30 in 1909, when it was common for people to have big families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The situation is a striking turnabout from 2007, when more babies were born in the United States than any other year in the nation&rsquo;s history. The recession began that fall, dragging stocks, jobs and births down.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the economy is bad and people are uncomfortable about their financial future, they tend to postpone having children. We saw that in the Great Depression the 1930s and we&rsquo;re seeing that in the Great Recession today,&#8221; said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could take a few years to turn this around,&#8221; he added, noting that the birth rate stayed low throughout the 1930s.</p>
<p>Another possible factor in the drop: a decline in immigration to the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last spring&rsquo;s report, on births in 2008, showed an overall drop but a surprising rise in births to women over 40, who may have felt they were running out of time to have children and didn&rsquo;t want to delay despite the bad economy.</p>

<p>What a downright LIE! The only people who have not been having children for the last 3 or 4 decades are WHITE people! They see where this country is headed with all the brown and black faces around them. They see the anti-White hate out there and they do not want to have their own children suffer a fate worse than the dark ages.</p>
<p> The immigrants keep on having kids no matter if there is a recession or not!  They know WE will pay for them all and they don&rsquo;t care if they live in ghettos or barrios because all their people live in the same community. </p>
<p>Whites have no place to go unless they are super rich and can get away from the hellholes that most American cities have become.</p>

		<p>#2 is hit the nail on the head.  The non-whites keep having them as if they are getting paid. That&rsquo;s right, they are getting paid to have them.  We are paying for our own dispossession.  I am going to tell my children not to have children.  </p>

		<p>Yes: Poster #2 is dead on.</p>
<p>Most white people either plan for children based on what htey can afford or if an &#8216;accident&rsquo; happens, they gear their finances towards providing for the kid.</p>
<p>Blacks and Latinos absolutely do not think this way.  They drop babies left and right without a care in the world as to who will take care of the finances.  </p>
<p>They know the magical government will shower them with free prenatal care, free medical care, food stamps, free or reduced housing, free education, free transportation, free counseling, free welfare, free childcare&hellip;UUUGh!</p>
<p>How else do you explain so many poor black and brown people having 4, 5, 6, or more kids apiece when they have either no jobs or dead end jobs that pay peanuts?</p>
<p>No white person I know would function this way.</p>

		<p>I would not be too worried. The United States is in a very bad position economically. Peak oil hit a couple of yrs ago and caused the collapse back in the fall of 2008. The peak oil situation will continue to get worse and the economy will continue to get worse as well. Remember back in 2009, people were saying the Democrats would control Congress for 40 years(James Carvile) and now it looks like the Republicans will take the House and Senate. 10 yrs ago few people saw the United States becoming bankrupt like it is right now. Look at how peoples views on obama has changed. Once the rest of the world stop buying our treasury bonds and we collapse like the Soviet Union did things will get interesting(give it 5 to 10 yrs). Remember no one in the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; saw the Soviet Union collapsing&hellip; The United States will collapse because of high oil prices (peak oil).</p>
<p>Things move very quickly these days. Things will get very interesting in the next 5 to 10 years.</p>

		<p>Where it gets mean is in the backfeed to the system.  Because it&rsquo;s not the total rates or even the generational lags it&rsquo;s _the cohort sizes and overlaps_.</p>
<p>A disproportionate cohort size may not find or fill jobs that sustain the population wealth fraction, systemically, (whites hiring whites in timely replacement intervals etc.) as well, forcing employers to go outside the bond group to hire less able or less welcome alternatives.  By the same token, those within the group itself may also not have as wide a mate selection pool without shifting to other races and further anemically degrading the total pool.</p>
<p>And the fact that these cohort groups ARE staggering out, 1.5-2 generations (i.e. 40 year old parents, who also lack the vitality to raise good kids) or more means that you are no longer seeing mild overlaps between breeding ages but sudden, freakishly intense, competitive periods.  Followed by long waits.  Which further spreads the behavior pattern.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this takes even more females out of the mating pool as a 20-30 something often doesn&rsquo;t see anything of worth in a 40-50 year old partner until it&rsquo;s too late (and she&rsquo;s married X racial alternative or is herself in an old maid situation).  At the same time a delayed male partner who is successful in wooing his preferred younger spouse is not simply a trophy wife winner but also denying someone else, closer to her own age.</p>
<p>At which point you start to see the logic in matchmaking as taking these decisions from the couples altogether.</p>
<p>Breeding when young is _important_, for a lot of reasons.  It solidifies gender role and social valuation, it provides a consistent, sustainable, societal reinvestment if not growth rate.  And it ensures that the genetics of the parents as well as the amount of energy they can provide is optimal in raising healthy, well adjusted, children that see in their mother and father, their own image in 15 years.  Not 30.</p>
<p>As an element of this, we may need to reconsider the value of R vs. K breeder strategies and reverting to dynastic systems which keep large, extended, families together in a group of paid-for homes to -sponsor- this approach.  Rather than be dwarfed by racial inequities between our own 1.82 TFR and those of Blacks (2.2 and up) and particularly Hispanics (2.8 - 3.1 and up).</p>
<p>@#4, rather than tell your kids not to reproduce (ha-ha, lot&rsquo;s of luck with that&hellip;) would you consider a 19th century approach where you supported, particularly your daughter&rsquo;s initial sexual selection at 16 and first child at say 19-21?  Youth being youthful has a lot to do with driving down social barriers which, once raised, tend to drive people towards self-not-race focused career paths and the like.</p>

		<p>The government has created schools where my children would be demonized by blacks, and then, if they survive, would be taxed into oblivion to pay for the welfare of said blacks, and people are surprised I never had children.  You&rsquo;re kidding me.  You&rsquo;re kidding me, right?</p>

		<p> I totally agree with poster #2. Non whites are having children at a phenominal rate due the white race being taxed to the max to pay for these children.<br>
 I went through a difficult period with one daughter fighting the effects of pneumicocchal masked for help from the government and was informed by a black woman that worked there that &#8221; qoute: You&rsquo;re the wrong damn color to be here asking for anything&#8221; unqoute. Needless to say she was right; all applications were denied.eningitis and another that was born with cystic fibrosis. I never asked for any assistance again.</p>

		<p>Well yes, #2 comment was right partially as was another person till what they spouted in the end about telling their kids not to have kids(I assuming they&rsquo;re white). <br>
Yes, nonwhites are breeding partly because of help from the government and a big part too. It&rsquo;s also strategic from them and the powers that be it&rsquo;s happening. <br>
In other words in on purpose to destroy us. <br>
Secondly, whites aren&rsquo;t having kids since we can&rsquo;t afford them. The rich whites who can are either too self indulgent or infertile. Listen people, for the latter I have a strategy that will help since it will keep them from adopting overseas and especially from China. But you have to suspend your sense of &#8220;righteousness&#8221; and think beyond your normal limits. This is no time to cower in boundries.  </p>
<p>Here goes : Whites who don&rsquo;t want abortions and don&rsquo;t want babies can directly adopt them out to rich whites who do. Sounds like it&rsquo;s been done before right? Hold on! What about poor whites? Pay them for the babies! In fact these poor whites can become breeding grounds for the rich to go to for white children for adoption.  America stays white, rich don&rsquo;t import xeno infants and poor whites can gain money too. Sounds crazy? These are bad times and things are getting worse. Soon even that might be too late. <br>

		<p>Rejecting children because of a lack of confidence in one&rsquo;s genes or parenting skills is understandable, but rejecting children because of the demographic problem is not a valid excuse. Having children and raising them to be proud of our people is the best thing we can do; choosing to not reproduce because blacks and browns are having more children is essentially accepting the extinction of the white race. </p>

		<p>@9,</p>
<p>If you were replying to me then the answer is no, I&rsquo;m not joking.  If you have pride in your race you cannot fail to provide the genetic baseline that gives us &#8216;diversity&rsquo; within our own pop group and provides a genetic bookmark that allows ALL whites to have matched partner options to do the same, another generation down the road.</p>
<p>Anything else is a guarantee of either denied reproductive opportunity or  miscegenation, either of which will only further drop the available population base from which to mount a genetic recovery.  Which in turn undermines THE KEY tenet of white belief in self superiority as a driver: we survive.  Thick or thin, thru lean times and plenty, our big brains drive us to ensure we are not killed faster than we can come back.</p>
<p>If you are worried about your children&rsquo;s future, find a smart woman, have a family and home school.  Most children that do so end up losing a little developmental social maturity but gaining as much as 2 grade levels in competency.</p>
<p>Smart breeds -and- succeeds.  Thintelligence thinks only of itself and it&rsquo;s own generational problems, projecting them on an unknown future.</p>
<p>Things will get better and even if they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s better to have rolled the dice and have your grandkids see their genes vanish into a pool of other ethnies than to assume that this will happen and thus assure it does.</p>
<p>Think of it as a dynastic duty you owe your people rather than any state.</p>

 My wife and I have 8 beautiful White children. We refuse to take part in any self-fulfilling prophecy, and have faith in our people and  that better times are on the way. <br>
 It saddens me when I hear of others who have made it that much more difficult for my children and future grandchildren to turn this thing around. <br>
 Shame on the lot of you who have raised the white flag of surrender and are contributing to your people&rsquo;s demise.</p>
