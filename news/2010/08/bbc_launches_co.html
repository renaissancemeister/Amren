			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tamara Cohen, Daily Mail (London), August 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The BBC has launched a competition to find multicultural sitcoms because the BBC is perceived to be &#8216;too white and middle class&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In a new political correctness row, comedy executives have called on writers who feel their lives are under-represented to submit the first ten pages of a sitcom to the BBC.</p>
<p>The winner of the contest may get the chance to pen a series.</p>
<p>It is run by the BBC College of Comedy which launched in 2008 to help new writers develop their careers.</p>
<p>Creative head of the college Micheal Jacob, who is the executive producer of the sitcom My Family starring Zoe Wanamaker told The Stage yesterday: &#8216;I think there is a feeling perhaps that the BBC is a closed door for writers who are not necessarily white middle class.</p>
<p>&#8216;I wanted to say the door is open and that we want to find shows that reflect the fact Britain is a multicultural society. We hope the competition will attract entries from writers who may feel their lives are not currently reflected in television comedy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The BBC will have exclusive rights to develop the scripts, with the possibility of a commission further down the line.</p>
<p>The move follows criticism of the BBC in 2008, when Extras producer Charlie Hanson claimed the number of black people working in creative positions had not changed in 15 years, particularly within the comedy department.</p>
<p>Politicians have criticised the scheme, although it is not clear what the criteria for entry are.</p>
<p>Philip Davies, MP for Shipley, said: &#8216;I think licence fee payers will be appalled to be subsidising a politically correct competition like this.</p>
<p>&#8216;We just want high quality programming irrespective of race or background. These things should be colour blind and awarded on merit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The initiative All Mixed Up is in collaboration with Triforce Promotions, an organisation formed by black actors Fraser Ayres and Jimmy Akingbola, which aims to promote talent from a range of backgrounds.</p>
<p>Jacob said he wanted to &#8216;tap into their network&rsquo; as part of the competition which opens on August 31.</p>
<p>The best six scripts will be performed by a professional cast at London&rsquo;s Soho Theatre on December 4 and the winner, decided by a panel of BBC executives, will get a £1,000 prize.</p>
<p>Former director-general Greg Dyke famously described the BBC&rsquo;s workforce as &#8216;hideously white&rsquo; in 2004 and caused a positive discrimination storm over plans to fast track ethnic staff into managerial positions.<br>

<p>The issue here is that the funniest black comics are also the most vulgar and racially honest.</p>
<p>As for this article, this is another black classic no-win situation.</p>
<p>In order to create a sitcom that mirrors minority life, it will have to employ stereotype characters (&#8216;keepin&rsquo; it real&rsquo;). The sitcom will be commended for promoting racist stereotypes and shouted off the air.</p>

		<p>I personally can&rsquo;t stand watching contemporary American TV anymore.  It&rsquo;s really gotten bad over the last ten years to the point that it&rsquo;s really nothing but a brainwashing tool for the masses.  Diversity, miscegenation, Christian bashing, unnatural themes, massive amounts of swearing, pornography, etc., most of it has become too toxic for me to watch.  I had all the movie channels and I realized after a time that I hardly ever watched any of them and I had them cancelled.     </p>

		<p>Bring back &#8220;Love Thy neighbour&#8221;!</p>
<p>This was a sitcom about 2 working class families, one black, one white, living next door to each other. It was popular and entertaining and always a great laugh. It did  not seem to offend anyone. It probably did more good than harm in matters of racial matters!</p>
<p>It was taken off the air about 20 years ago by the British race relations authorities as it was thought it may be offensive to ethnic minorities. Taking it off air does not seem to have improved the race sition in the UK one little bit.</p>

		<p>They probably won&rsquo;t find any writers for &#8220;Asian&#8221; comedy because Muslims aren&rsquo;t very funny people - they inherently take themselves too seriously, as do all &#8220;proud&#8221; peoples.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. I mostly just watch old sitcoms like Seinfeld and the Nanny these days, as all the new sitcoms and most other shows are complete garbage (am I the only one who saw the commercials for &#8220;Hot in Cleveland&#8221; and wanted to write an angry letter to the producers?). A new sitcom on ABC I think, so creatively-entitled &#8220;Melissa and Joey,&#8221; looked so bad by the commercials, that I felt sick. Let alone did I laugh. The same is equally true with children&rsquo;s shows. Back in the nineties, when I was young, I would watch shows like the Rugrats, Spongebob Squarepants, Hey Arnold, not Oscar winners or anything but at least these shows were tolerable. The stuff they show now on dead networks like Nickelodeon and Disney are so bad, I can&rsquo;t possibly describe how much I hate them. TERRIBLE scripts, TERRIBLE acting, ABSOLUTELY NO interesting storyline at all, GOD-AWFUL jokes&hellip; they are a waste of TV slots. If you don&rsquo;t have children and need proof of this, go to YouTube and look at clips of shows such as &#8220;iCarly,&#8221; &#8220;Victorious,&#8221; and by personal least-favorite, &#8220;Big Time Rush.&#8221; But I&rsquo;m warning you, have an paper bag handy. You will need it.</p>
<p>And British television is no better, so really I don&rsquo;t care if the BBC wants to put itself into an even deeper hole, those multicultural bastards totally deserve it.</p>

		<p>Every so often the BBC does one of its &#8216;hideously white&rsquo;(Use Google Search to understand the reference)guilt trips and then &#8216;opens doors&rsquo; for new ideas and writers. The problem is most of the soaps featuring blacks and  Asians written for the BBC  are nearly always written by these same liberal whites. So almost inevitably it tends to come out with an uncle tom flavour and falls flat on all sides. Maybe the BBC ought to just do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do and let the viewers decide what they want. Besides  whatever is lost on coverage in sitcoms for the ethnics is  more than made up for in the amount of black faces popping up everywhere else, be it News, Weather, Chat shows, Docus, even British period dramas (like Moll Flanders, featuring Morgan Freenman as one of her lovers), and of course the soaps, where always they will be shown in the best possible light. Reminds me: about thirty years ago the BBC ran an all black soap called &#8216;Empire Road&rsquo; set somewhere in South London. But as the only ones really watching were the blacks, it was soon axed.<br>
 Ho-hum. </p>

		<p>When America was 90 percent White not longer than 40 years ago there were no multicultural writers for TV shows and there weren&rsquo;t any minority characters that I can discern from watching old reruns of TV programs.  The multicult garbage started in the 70s with shows like &#8220;The Jeffersons&#8221; and &#8220;All in the Family&#8221; and it&rsquo;s been steadily snowballing ever since.  Why would Great Britain, a European country with a supposedly 8 percent nonwhite population need to cater to nonwhite ethnic minorities in TV programming?    </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a novel idea&hellip; REJECT SITCOMS.   Read books and watch the educational channels and test your historical knowledge against those shows.  I have fun knowing that I can correct The History Channel. It is better than knowing what latest joke was told on some sitcom.  Standard television is such an insult towards my intelligence.   I would rather advocate alcoholism than televisionism.  I&rsquo;ve known many a brighter alcoholic than a television junkie, and let us not discuss alcoholic, television junkies.  </p>

		<p>I used to be a real couch potato and watch TV all the time but as the programming becomes more and more alien, I only watch a fraction of what I used to.  For the first time I&rsquo;m starting to think that diversity will probably be the death knell of TV as an entertainment platform and we&rsquo;ll probably see it in our lifetimes.  I just wonder what will replace it?</p>

		<p>My favourite sitcom is Upstairs Downstairs. It harks back to the turn of the last century and the golden years of Victorian Britain. Now yes there may be a lot &#8220;wrong&#8221; with it in terms of the elite upper classes ect.. but it is so nice to see through a looking glass as it were; how they did things in the olden days of Empire. Honour, Values, Christian virtues all come to the fore and by God did they pay for these values with their lives in WW1.</p>

		<p>I love watching British comedies and other British programs on ETV, because they are white and middle class. If I wanted to watch something that was diverse and low class, I&rsquo;d watch American programs, which I seldom do.</p>
