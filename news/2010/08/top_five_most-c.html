			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terry Jeffrey, Townhall, August 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When measured by the number of criminal defendants charged with federal crimes by U.S. attorneys, the top five U.S. judicial districts for fiscal 2009 were all on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>In fact, these five judicial districts are the only five on the U.S.-Mexico border  &mdash;  covering its entire expanse from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Southern District of Texas, which covers a stretch of border from Brownsville past Laredo, the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office filed criminal charges against 8,801 defendants in fiscal 2009. That gave that district the nation&rsquo;s No. 1 ranking for most criminal defendants charged in 2009, according to data published in Table 1 of the United States Attorneys&rsquo; Annual Statistical Report for Fiscal Year 2009.</p>
<p>The 8,801 criminal defendants charged in the Southern District of Texas, in fact, was more than four times the 1,959 charged in the Southern District of New York (which includes Manhattan and the Bronx) and more than six times the 1,377 charged in the Eastern District of New York (which included Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island).</p>
<p>Following the Southern District of Texas as the No. 2 district in the nation for the most criminal defendants is the Western District of Texas, which covers the rest of the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. The U.S. attorney here filed charges against 8,435 defendants in 2009.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top five are the districts for Southern California (5,554 defendants charged), Arizona (5,155) and New Mexico (3,769).</p>
<p>The 5,554 criminal defendants charged in Southern District of California  &mdash;  which includes San Diego and Imperial counties and covers the entire California stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border  &mdash;  was more than twice the 2,581 charged in the Central District of California, which includes the nearby Los Angeles metropolitan area, but does not touch the border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The United States Attorneys&rsquo; Annual Statistical Report for Fiscal Year 2009, compiled and released by President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Justice Department, {snip} reveals that of the 81,577 defendants convicted in federal court in 2009, 26,538 were convicted in cases the Justice Department categorized as immigration cases. Another 26,399 were convicted in drug cases. That means 33 percent of federal convictions were in immigration cases and 32 percent in drug cases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clearly, the surge in immigration crime and drug crime and the concentration of crime at the U.S.-Mexico border are inter-related.</p>

		<p>This is impossible!</p>
<p>After all, Ron Unz and the American Conservative magazine recently &#8220;proved&#8221; that hispanics are just as law-abiding as whites.</p>
<p>Therefore the authorities must have imagined all these crimes!</p>

		<p>Just more evidence that Obama&rsquo;s complaints about the AZ law are a pack of lies!  Obviously, the feds are prosecuting illegals without nary a squawk about being overburdened.  And will AZ cops helping just get in their way, I suppose?  Maricopa Co. already deports 1/4 of those booted back over the border.  I sometimes feel like the judges in this country are under the influence of evil aliens  &mdash;  from space!</p>

		<p>Just look at the drop in charges from 5th to 6th place! Most of the top 10 are relatively close to the border and are likely affected by illegal immigration and drug cartels as well. The United States should build a wall along its southern border, if at all possible.</p>

El Paso&rsquo;s Low Crime Rate<br>
[Steve Sailer] <br>
          <br>
The [January 22, 2009] NYT article &ldquo;Two Sides of a Border: One Violent, One Peaceful&ldquo; compares the low murder rate in El Paso to the carnage in Ciudad Juarez across the Rio Grande&hellip;The newspaper mentions various theories, but the article should have mentioned that El Paso has long been famous for an anomalously low crime rate.<br>
