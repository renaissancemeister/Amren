<h1>Boatload of Migrants a Wake-Up Call for Canada</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Ibbitson and Marten Youssef, Globe and Mail (Toronto), August 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With a boatload of up to 500 Tamil refugee claimants expected to enter Canadian territorial waters as early as Thursday evening, and with more ships reportedly on the way, the Conservative government is scrambling to reverse this country&rsquo;s growing international reputation as an easy mark for people fleeing their homelands.</p>
<p>The MV Sun Sea entered Canada&rsquo;s 200-nautical-mile economic management zone Wednesday, and is expected to enter territorial waters Thursday evening or Friday morning, said a government source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Earlier estimates put the passengers at 200.</p>
<p>The government is unable to confirm a report that one person aboard the vessel has died.</p>
<p>Officials have been preparing for the influx of new migrants. On Wednesday evening, observers saw one large Marquis tent and11 smaller tents being pitched near Fisgard Lighthouse off Esquimalt Lagoon and a number of Canadian Border Services Agency personnel on scene. Two British Columbia jails have been preparing for the arrival of hundreds.</p>
<p>The Canadian government believes that several other vessels currently in international waters off southern Asia may also be heading, or planning to head, to Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is increasing concern that we are becoming the target of international smugglers,&#8221; the official said. Immigration, police and public security officials are attempting to develop options to deter the smugglers, the official said.</p>
<p>Canada is working with governments in Asia to identify and intercept vessels that may contain asylum seekers, but the government is not ready to discuss what else, if anything, can be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re just sitting back and waiting,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing concrete as of yet, but it&rsquo;s an area that we&rsquo;re looking to address as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naval and government officials said they&rsquo;ve been monitoring the vessel since it departed in May from Thailand, where it is registered. The MV Sun Sea was originally bound for Australia, but inexplicably changed course and headed for British Columbia along the Pacific Ocean route.</p>
<p>Citing security concerns, the Ministry of Defence would not confirm whether the vessel was monitored through satellite or physical surveillance.</p>
<p>Last October, a rusting vessel known as Ocean Lady docked in Vancouver with 76 Sri Lankan citizens aboard. All have since been released and filed refugee claims, most are living in Toronto and few, if any, face a realistic prospect of deportation.</p>
<p>Canada has an obligation under international law to accept the vessel and process refugee applications, said Yvon Dandurand, an international expert on human smuggling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling them illegal immigrants is simply wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are coming here to seek status .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we have a process for refugee determination and they will go through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It takes four years or more to process a refugee claim, and people familiar with the system say that by then claimants typically have found jobs, gotten married, had children, or otherwise put down such deep roots that one way or another they persuade federal officials to let them stay. The same prospects await those approaching Canada&rsquo;s shores on the Sun Sea.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tamil Congress said most of the Sri Lankans detained at the Fraser Regional Corrections Centre after their arrival last year were not treated like suspects.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ones I spoke to said they were treated with a lot of respect,&#8221; said media co-ordinator Manjula Selvarajah, adding that they were comparing the treatment to the kind they received in Sri Lanka. Detention officials made sure they had access to health care, she said, and many of them also had access to legal counsel.</p>
<p>A handful of Toronto lawyers were en route to Vancouver Wednesday night to assist the incoming migrants, she said.</p>
<p>Parliament passed new legislation in June to reform the refugee laws, making it quicker both for legitimate refugees to obtain asylum and for illegitimate claimants to be deported. The goal is to have claims heard within 60 to 90 days of arrival, and for illegitimate claimants to be out of the country within two years.</p>
<p>But federal officials estimate it will take 12 to 18 months more to upgrade computers, train public servants and otherwise prepare for an official switch to the new rules. In the meantime, the ships keep coming, while immigration, border security and police puzzle how to staunch the flow.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow warned that the people on board the Sun Sea must be treated no differently from anyone else seeking asylum here.</p>
<p>&#8220;There shouldn&rsquo;t be any different treatment of anyone who arrives on the shores of Canada, whether it is by plane or by boat or by car or by walking,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;If they are claiming to be refugees, then let&rsquo;s deal with them according to the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ocean Lady migrants were not treated differently because of the way they arrived, Ms. Selvarajah said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite rumours and innuendo, Canadian Border Services officials did what they typically do with anyone who shows up at our border,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If their case was valid, they were taken through the transitional refugee claim system. If not, they were rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Chow pointed out that when Canadian officials have turned away a ship with passengers seeking asylum in the past, the results have been tragic. After the Komagata Maru was turned away from Canada in 1914, British soldiers shot 26 of the vessel&rsquo;s passengers upon its return to India.</p>
<p>And in 1939, Canada refused admission to more than 900 Jews fleeing Nazi persecution aboard the St. Louis. The ship returned to Europe and most of its passengers died in concentration camps.<br>

<p></p>
<p>How typical. I lived on Canada&rsquo;s west coast in 1999, when boatload after boatload of Chinese &#8216;refugees&rsquo; kept coming. One lawyer I talked to told me that this was a bonanza for private-practice lawyers, as they could easily provide these &#8216;refugees&rsquo; with legal counsel because 1) it was mandated, and 2) the government paid the tab. Contrast that with me, a white man - I&rsquo;d never get the government to pay MY fee for legal service representation.</p>
<p>I believe most lawyers love Canada&rsquo;s open-door refugee policy. After all, it provides them with some pretty big bucks.</p>

		<p>I just recently purchased Camp of The Saints and I am about half way thru the novel.  Reading this news item has scared me!  I live in Nevada and I am witnessing first hand the wave of illegals swarming across this country, but I never imagined that I would see the day when boatloads of illegals land on the North American shores.</p>

<p>I did.  VERY interesting to say the least.</p>
<p>The CBC is The Party&rsquo;s bastion of PC propaganda, so it&rsquo;s quite amazing to see so much dissent towards the official PC line.  In addition to that, I&rsquo;ll wager that several more negative (to them) comments would be up there, except that they probably have a staff of inner / outer  Party organs whose job it is to censor comments accordingly.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that my simple comment (&ldquo;Camp Of The Saints anyone?&rdquo;) never made it up there!</p>

		<p>Yet again we have to hear what Olivia Chow has to say. It seems every time immigration is in the news the reporters go to her for comments. I&rsquo;ve never heard her be critical of immigration;  with her it&rsquo;s always more more. If there are any problems it is because of racism or lack of government spending. Well it&rsquo;s easy to be critical but I suggest she has to earn her credentials as an expert and critic. How about she tells us what she thinks is an upper limit for immigration and what problems would arise if we went over her upper limit? Let&rsquo;s pin her down on numbers and specifics.</p>
<p>I also notice how one has to only mention &#8220;international law&#8221; and everyone goes quiet. It&rsquo;s like it is holy and sacred. We have enough trouble in Canada making and enforcing our own laws. We have to juggle; opinion polls, democracy, parliament, judges, police, sentencing, and jails. Nothing is sacred about how we manage our own legal system. Everyone can critize and the law can be changed if enough people want it. I suggest we treat international law the same way. If we have signed treaties then we should immediately withdraw from them. I don&rsquo;t see how we can call ourselves a democracy if we are beholden to unchangeable obligations to international treaties and laws.   </p>

<p>YUP! it&rsquo;s true. Many of us working overseas (including the military) with Indians, Philippines, Pakistanis (of all people!) and others from 4th world have shown positive for TB and quite a number of other &#8220;diversity enriching&#8221; ailments to include polio! of all FN things! This knowledge is from my personal experiences though I suspect the overall statistics are as closely guarded secret as the Obamaster&rsquo;s non existent birth certificate.</p>

		<p>Presumably these people are from Ceylon, or whatever it&rsquo;s called nowadays. Immediately to the north of Ceylon, and within a few miles of its coast, is the Indian state of Tamilnadu - the Tamils&rsquo; very own self governing homeland. Yet they prefer to sail halfway round the world to get to Canada? That alone proves that they are economic migrants, not people in desperate flight from persecution. So why doesn&rsquo;t Canada just chuck them out? No doubt for the same mysterious reasons that my own government (British) seems unable to bring itself to part with any of its hundreds of thousands of dark skinned new arrivals.</p>

		<p>The saddest part is that there is nothing to vote for in Canada.</p>
<p>Olivia Chow is the partner of the NDP leader Jack Layton which is pro immigration.</p>
<p>The Liberals and Conservatives are responsible for the last forty years of uncontrolled minority immigration.</p>
<p>The Conservative Party was essentially eliminated after Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell.</p>
<p>An upstart western party called the Reform Party was supposed to provide some hope of sanity, however their leader Preston Manning was set aside in favor of Stephen Harper, who is now the Canadian Prime Minister.  The Reform Party has become the new conservative party.</p>
<p>Guess what&hellip;&hellip;..it is business as usual for the conservatives and liberals&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;keep em coming by the boatload, planeload, or whatever.</p>
<p>Why are there no great white leaders that have the interests of white people as a priority?</p>
<p>You cannot blame the electorate, there is nothing to vote for.</p>
<p>Same in the US, republicans and democrats are the same evil.</p>
<p>Great Britain provides an option in the British National Party, but the electorate fails to support them adequately where they can form power.</p>
<p>The French had an opportunity for change but instead opted for more immigration.</p>
<p>The future does not bode well for the accomodating white europeans and their descendents.</p>

		<p>Nothing speaks to the decline and eclipse of the west more then this episode. The inability of a once proud and great western nation to deport one single ship of unwanted illegals who could have just crossed the few miles of strait to India, but chose to sail halfway around the world to live off the dole of the White man&hellip;</p>
<p>Now in 1914 Sikhs tried this same trick. But then Canada did what it should have done. It deported all of them. Something catastrophic happned to the west in the twentieth century. It basically lost its will to live and its confidence. Maybe it was the two fratricidal wars in Europe&hellip;</p>

		<p>Immigrants bringing in TB?   You bet!   Since Canada and America opened their doors to the Third World in 1965, both countries have seen a return of diseases that were eradicated decades ago.<br>
Not only tuberculosis now crops up regularly but we even have a few cases of leprosy (you know, that horrible disease they wrote about in the Old Testament) showing up every year.<br>
Just more joys of ethnic diversity, folks.  And there are millions more out there just waiting to come across the pond to live among us.</p>

		<p>To #10 White Advocate from Canada.I agree with you completely and I think I share your frustration (and most other comments on this web site) as to why, just why, do US Can, Oz NZ EU have to take in all of these 3rd world, Islamic &amp; Asian ILLEGAL imigrants. Our politicians seem to blythly say &#8220;Oh its our international obligation etc etc. Why, why can&rsquo;t these illegals just go to another Islamic/Tamil/Asia friendly country.<br>
The shipload of 500 Illegals should just set every alarm bell ringing before the floodgates just open totally. And as a final comment on international law &amp; obligations; That trial re an ethnic minority supermodel and Liberian diamonds with it&rsquo;s all- star international PC line up (Mandela etc), is this part of the organisation that can now dictate policy and rule over sovereign democratic nations? It is very worrying.</p>

		<p>This may be an interesting editorial for readers of AMREN: <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1443" rel="nofollow">https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1443</a>  It discusses how on Sri Lanka, language (or rather multilingualism) led to fear and conflict. The Sinhalese had a monoethnic culture for 2000 years and achieved a &#8220;great civilization&#8221; (comment from CIA World Factbook) in their own right. The Tamils immigrated (invaded?) in the 14th century and the result was conflict. Granted, it took a while, but the end result of the multiethnicity is what we see today on the Island. Had the Tamil never been allowed on the Island in the first place, it would be a very different story.  The entire process is in play now in the UK (England in particular), but in a greatly condensed form, and will eventually play out in America.</p>

Shhhssh!    Don&rsquo;t remind them!  Otherwise, expect to hear soon of an official government apology and a large payment of restitution to the Sikhs. And, of course, an invitation for all Sikhs to come to Canada as a gesture of reconciliation for how they&rsquo;ve been &#8220;wronged&#8221;.   (This is already being done with the Chinese.)</p>
