<h1>Charles Barron: &#8220;Racism Permeates Every Institution in This State&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Celeste Katz, New York Daily News, August 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barron [Brooklyn City Councilman Charles Barron] had perhaps 75 people with him on the steps of Brooklyn Borough Hall. One was waving a huge red-black-and-green pan-African flag. They piled stacks of petitions on a table that Barron said had 45,500 signatures, and chanted &#8220;Blacks and Latinos first!&#8221; and &#8220;Whose party? Our party!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No longer are we going to allow the Democrats to take the black vote for granted, Republicans to ignore us or the white progressives on the left to use us,&#8221; Barron said. &#8220;No longer will we let this state be quiet on race. Race matters. Racism permeates every institution in this state, and we&rsquo;re gonna let it be known loud and clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The councilman, who discussed taxing the rich and ending stop and frisks by the police, continued: &#8220;{snip}This party is a black- and Latino-led party that is open up to everybody. If we take care of blacks and Latinos, the state will be better off. Because if you&rsquo;re giving us living-wage jobs, you can keep your welfare. If you give us youth centers and workforce development programs in our community, you can keep your prisons.&#8221;</p>
<p>The official slate is Barron for governor, Eva Doyle of Buffalo for lieutenant governor and Ramon Jimenez of Bronx for attorney general. (No comptroller candidate yet.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of all the candidates out there running, Barron said in regard to petition-gathering, &#8220;The only gubernatorial candidate, the only attorney general candidate, the only lieutenant governor candidate that took our case to the people is the Freedom Party. The all-white state slate of the Democratic Party is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for debates: &#8220;Let the debates begin! When we get in the debates, tell Cuomo I&rsquo;m looking for him! Tell Lazio he&rsquo;d better get out the way. And if they try to say we&rsquo;re some fringe organization, and we can&rsquo;t be in the debates, we&rsquo;re going to break the door down! This is not fringe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barron noted that lawyer Alton Maddox, Jr.  &mdash;  the lawyer who defended Tawana Brawley and other notable clients before having his law license suspended  &mdash;  organized much of the signature gathering both upstate and here in NYC through his group, the United African Movement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asked about petition challenges, Barron said, &#8220;Bring it. We dare them to challenge us. Why would you want to challenge 43,000 signatures? Whoever challenges us, we welcome it, and we&rsquo;re going to say to this state, anybody who challenges these petitions obviously wants to keep the state all-white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lisberg also saw Senatorial hopeful Gail Goode, who is running a longshot primary campaign against incumbent Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. She said she&rsquo;s also frustrated at all-white Dem slate and was shooed away from doing anything at the Dem convention. She says she has enough signatures and is on the ballot, but if she loses a primary, won&rsquo;t run on the Freedom Party slate.</p>

		<p>Question for Mr. Barron:  Can you name me a state where your contention about the deep permeation of racism through all its institutions isn&rsquo;t true?</p>
<p>On this subject, David Paterson is acting halfway responsibly on the Ground Zero Mosque issue.  It&rsquo;s a shame the Democrats threw him away so easily.  The bigot I am saw him as the sort of diamond in the rough that he was all along.  At the very least, he&rsquo;s no worse than any other person the NYS body politic of either major party could produce.</p>

<p>Phew!  For a minute, I thought this might have been a White Nationalist rally, collecting signatures and chanting &#8220;Whites first!&#8221;  That would have been Racist.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Racism permeates every institution in this state&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Well, Charlie, you&rsquo;re right about that, at least.  Only, it&rsquo;s <i>anti-White</i> racism.<br>

		<p>So, a liberal and a citizen of color, is claiming that &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo; is part of every institution in NY state&rsquo;? This is as crazy as Nancy Pelosi demanding to know who if financing the anti-mosque on ground-zero movement. </p>
<p>A mosque is being build near ground zero at the world trade center, and Pelosi wants to know, not who is behind the plan to build of the mosque, but who is behind the anti-mosque protest&hellip; Just as a note, they say almost everyone in NYC, yes even NYC, is against the mosque.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say if this is a grab for power, or rather if it is just a naked display of power. It&rsquo;s like the reverse the current left (the bigger the lie you tell the move believable it is). The more evil your display of power, the more effective it is, because you&rsquo;re only concerned with showing audacity of your power. Otherwise you&rsquo;d have to figure these folks are trying to embarrass themselves. Perhaps it&rsquo;s beyond the point where that&rsquo;s possible. Even if they are trying to embarrass themselves, it ends up serving their cause even more.</p>

		<p>I see the cracks in the Democrat &#8220;rainbow coalition&#8221; are starting to form.  I have predicted the short term gains by democrats in pandering to all non-white groups would be short lived.  Blacks, hispanics, gays, white liberals and Asians have widely differing goals.  Blacks and hispanics certainly don&rsquo;t see eye to eye on who&rsquo;s should to be running things.  The only common goal that all the groups have is the eradication of the white middle class.  </p>

Councilman Barron is to be commended and encouraged. He&rsquo;s speaking the truth as a black man sees it. He sees that the white Democrats use blacks as their stepping stone to power. He&rsquo;s bring race into politics. Everyone needs to hear what he&rsquo;s saying. It&rsquo;s too bad only a black man is allowed to speak so freely. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;The official slate is Barron for governor, Eva Doyle of Buffalo&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Councilman Barron has been on local black radio here in Buffalo. Ms. Eva Doyle is an Afro-centrist who has free reign to lecture in Buffalo Public schools about the accomplishments of blacks (such as the invention of the ironing board).</p>
<p>For information on Eva Doyle:</p>

		<p>Translation: Hey Democratic big shots, don&rsquo;t take the Black vote for granted. We won&rsquo;t vote Republican, but we may not vote at all, or we can set up minor parties (like non-brain dead white people) to vote for. So smarten up and start delivering more goodies to us black folks, oh yeah a little bit for the Latinos too. </p>

<p>Why is it that &#8216;we&rsquo; always have to &#8216;give?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No one gave our ancestors anything and they carved out the wilderness with their own hands and built the most advanced civilization in the world.</p>
<p>Now that civilization is in rapid decline (just in four decades, &#8220;wow&#8221; I say: what a fall!)</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t blacks open businesses, make factories, etc.  There are already a lot of black owned community banks.  The larger banks fall all over themselves to help minorities.  Where is the vision?  Where is the cooperation for a common goal?</p>
<p>All they do is take swipes at us and try to take what we worked for.  I go to work and work hard everyday.  I am a teacher and my student body is 100% non-white and I do my best to inspire them and teach them (and some respond and grow, while most don&rsquo;t seem to care for more than what&rsquo;s on their Ipod).</p>
<p>I put myself through college, even though my goals were always ill-defined, I knew that a college educaton could at least open doors.</p>
<p>Non-whites are soon to be the new masters of this land.  They had best learn how to do for themselves because they won&rsquo;t be able to rely on merely taking from us much longer. </p>

		<p>From the article as presented here:</p>
<p><i>Because if you&rsquo;re giving us living-wage jobs, you can keep your welfare. If you give us youth centers and workforce development programs in our community, you can keep your prisons.</i></p>
<p>Funny, for in a lot of big cities populated by blacks, they have the &#8220;living-wage jobs&#8221; (read:  make-work affirmative action), the &#8220;youth centers,&#8221; and the &#8220;workforce development programs&#8221; (more affirmative action).  Yet, there is still lots of welfare usage, and a lot of the &#8220;yoots&#8221; from those communities who were &#8220;honor roll students who just happened to fall in with the wrong crowd&#8221; still get sent off to prison &#8220;for no discernible reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the original article not quoted here:</p>
<p><i>What about all of those young people who have degrees and can&rsquo;t get a job? What about young people that are in church? &hellip; There&rsquo;s a lot of young people who are doing the right thing in this society, and this society has not given them their due.</i></p>
<p>There are a lot of those young people.  Except that they&rsquo;re white, so Screwball Barron nor his Eva Peron of a running mate care about them.<br>

		<p>The Chinese were ironing fabrics in the 1100&rsquo;s.  I get so sick of hearing about black inventors who seem to have created things we poor ignorant whites would never have considered, yet are vital to our lives.  Let&rsquo;s see one of them invent a way to get all of them off the dole.<br>

<p>Racism does indeed permeate every institution in this state   &mdash;    anti-white racism.  Charles Barron plans to make it much, much worse.  This is an inevitable consequence of &#8220;diversity&#8221;   &mdash;   as whites become a minority, the black and Latinos gang up against us, at least when they can take time out from fighting one another.</p>
<p>I hope you have all read the lead article in the current, September 2010 issue of American Renaissance.  Few articles I have read have done such a good job of describing the multicultural madhouse that this country has become.  The real pity is that that article, by ex-liberal/do-gooder Tracy Abel, will be read by so few people.  Yes, you can read it for free by downloading the current issue, but how many people come to this site?  After all, this is an official &#8220;hate site&#8221; according to the SPLC, so most respectable white people won&rsquo;t come near.  Too bad, because every white person in this country needs to read that article, whether they know it or not.</p>

<p>Yeah, Jay&hellip;.that reminds me of what I heard about the Mayan calender a while ago. The Mayans believe that 2012, which is in other religious beliefs, that the &#8216;New Race&rsquo; will appear to hold and control our future.</p>
<p>Maybe its the &#8216;New&rsquo; White Race with a different mindset&hellip;or maybe its the blacks race that will dominate.</p>
<p>The problem is that so many Whites have adopted this new culture of blacks while rejecting their own.</p>
<p>Its sickening to see the betrayal of your own People. Its sickening to watch then wallow in this culture that will be the defeat of everything White.</p>
<p>And they dont care. And I hate them for it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The official slate is Barron for governor, Eva Doyle of Buffalo for lieutenant governor and Ramon Jimenez of Bronx for attorney general&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Expect to see slates such as this more frequently and in more areas.</p>
<p>We may laugh now at the ridiculousness of racist, White-hating jerks like barron, the very idea that (HA HA HA!!) a loudmouth like barron would even deign to run for governor!  The very idea is beyond comprehension, the notion that blacks and latinos have a shot at running the very highest offices of NY! That he thinks he will garner any votes with his White-hating, communist campaign. &hellip;. absolutely ridiculous&hellip;. or is it?</p>
<p>Have we Whites been asleep at the wheel?</p>
<p>Because in the not too distant future, the governor of NY WILL BE Comrade Barron with Comrades Doyle and Jimenez by his side to implement his plans, with throng of screaming non-White supporters ready, able and willing to usher in a New Order.</p>
<p>Those plans and that New Order do not bode well for Whites.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already laying out an anti-White strategy for the future of New York:  &#8216;Blacks and Latinos first!&rsquo;, &#8216;Whose Party?  &#8216;Our Party!&rsquo; &#8216;Race matters!&rsquo; (he&rsquo;s not talking about the White race here, folks)  &rsquo; [White] racism permeates every institution in this state, and we&rsquo;re gonna let it be known loud and clear!&rsquo; &#8216;Tax the rich!&rsquo;  &#8216;If we take care of blacks and Latinos, the state will be better off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This man may be an idiot, but he is deadly serious as are his followers who are and will increase in number. I wouldn&rsquo;t dismiss a word of what he says.</p>
<p>I would take it as a deadly warning to all Whites as to what lies ahead for us in the future, in our own homelands.</p>

		<p>I hear the same old refrain  &mdash;  &#8220;Give us, give us, give us, or we&rsquo;ll break down the door and take waht we want.&#8221; Nothing new here except they are saying it out loud and letting us know what they have planned. I say give them all a one-way ticket to their so-called &#8220;Motherland&#8221; of Africa. Disembark them out on the shore and let them make their own way where and as they wish among others of their own type. (And no more &#8220;Famine Aid&#8221; to any country in Africa, either.) Cut the entire continent out of world travel and let them vegetate another 2000-3000 years, maybe they&rsquo;ll invent the wheel by then&hellip; </p>

		<p>Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza in his book &#8220;The End of Racism&#8221; which came out years ago, remarked that &#8220;American blacks live in a haunted house of racism; populated by white ghosts.&#8221;  Initially, i just laughed at this comment, but after witnessing years of typical black behaviour, I have to agree with this observtion a hundred percent.

		<p>As long as Blacks and Whites live together in the same civilization there will be conflict. Based on academic ability Blacks will be a permanent underclass. That is why they are installing their Communists now. Seperation ( and I do not mean unconstitutional segregation ) is the only way to avoid violence and for blacks to fulfill their destinies.</p>

<p>Good Point. But I have an uncomfortable question to ask you. Do you think there will be any whites in the world, 2000 years from today? Do you even think there will be white people around 200 years from today? Where will those whites come from, when white women are having a fertility rate of 1.6 children per woman, and as low as 1.3 children in some European nations? We need a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman to keep the white population at its current level.</p>
<p>Prof. Richard Lynn predicts that non-whites will become a majority of the British population in 2061. That is only 51 years from today. A British kid who is now a junior in high school, will end his working life in a non-white Britain. Here is the article with the shocking statistics:  <br>

		<p>While sitting in a major traffic jam in Atlantic City a few days ago a young Black male in a new Honda Accord pulled right in front of me with all four windows down and this RAP blasting at full volume accompanied by his chanting along with it also at full volume. Not only was he and the CD loud but at the same time he was jumping up and down in his seat, wildly flailing his arms and gesticulating with each of his index fingers as he screamed out the &#8220;lyrics&#8221;. His car was rocking from side to side and bow to stern. I feared that the car would become airborne. When there was a small opening between two cars  he threaded the needle barely missing a side swipe of two other cars and came to stop approximately one car length from where he began. He then began his gyrations and gesticulations accompanied by his screaming of the aforementioned lyrics.<br>
I&rsquo;m convinced that a good percentage of Blacks are congenitally psychotic.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;Racist&rsquo; Is a Code Word for &#8216;White.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That is a very good link you posted, everyone should read it.</p>
<p>James Edwards has also picked up the Racist = White mantra and the sooner Whites understand and internalize this axiom, the better.  From Racism, Schmacism:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been getting increasingly obvious, for years now, that &#8216;racist&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean someone who hates members of other races and wants to harm them..it has become nothing but a racial slur directed at white people in order to shame us into voting, believing, or behaving a certain way.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t deny.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t argue.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to prove you&rsquo;re not a &lsquo;racist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just laugh in their face. Then counter-attack. Point out how whites in this country just want a level playing field, and that it is the minority groups who want racist preferences. Tell them they&rsquo;re obsessed with race&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Good Advice.</p>

		<p>This is actually very good news, VERY good news, for three reasons:</p>
<p>1.) If blacks and Hispanics are allowed to do this sort of racial politics stuff, then so will we, not immediately but soon it will become accepted.</p>
<p>2.) If this part is able to steal most of the Democrats&rsquo; black and Hipanic voters, then that means a multi-party, rather than a two-party system. And the old parties would be less inclined to pander to minority interests.</p>
<p>3.) Hopefully this will cause liberals to wake up and stop being so desperate for the minority vote.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all hope this sparks a new age in American politics.</p>

		<p>&#8220;American blacks live in a haunted house of racism; populated by white ghosts&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wonder if that statement is more prophetic than anything else. That is, even after separation, or even where there are really no whites around to bother them, the phantom specter of &#8216;white racism&rsquo; will be the glue that holds their animosity together. </p>

<p>So why does every black and mestizo in the world want to come here?</p>
<p>And why is it that most all complainers are black?  </p>
<p>And why do blacks always include mestizos in their whining?  Could it be because they want to hide the fact that blacks are behind even mestizos in succeeding in this country and blacks want to divert attention away from the fact they are in last place of all the races?</p>

		<p>Sigh. I have said it before, and I will say it again. </p>
<p>If you are terrified of a declining white birthrate,and the thought of whites as a minority,there is really only one solution. </p>
<p>Have larger white families!! And raise the children right,don&rsquo;t just have larger families. Teach them the values that made us great. Teach them the value of work (even lowly work), education, savings, restraint, respect. </p>

		<p>The majority of whites need to speak up if they do not want the non-whites to become the majority.  This country was founded on white brain power.  It will descend into a African or Hispanic like nation once the whites become less of a critical mass.  The whites presently do not have the will power except for a few to stop all this nonsense of non-whites.  It is all but NONSENSE.  This nonsense of these non-whites is shown by the inner cities of this country.  These inner cities will always remain inner cities if the non-whites are the majority no matter how much affirmative action, wasted money, etc are pumped in.  This country has been regressing since the 1950&rsquo;s and more so since the 1960&rsquo;s due to &#8220;civil rights&#8221; nonsense.  The black race in general do not have the inherent capabilities to maintain an advanced civilization.  The whites presently in power are manipulating the rest of the whites to go along with their nonsense of giving preferential treatment to non-whites.  This article is nothing but nonsense.     </p>

		<p>31) It&rsquo;s often the mulattos/mixed blacks who dislike whites the most, as they have the most to gain from whites leaving.  With an IQ that far surpasses that of their fully african brethren, without whitey, THEY are the elite.  Without whites around to stop them, they&rsquo;re able to fully oppress and use their fellow blacks to enhance their own personal status.  Which I have no problem with, mind you - the top dog who can climb his way to the top deserves to be there.  It&rsquo;s just the whole &#8216;getting rid of whitey&rsquo; part that irks me, what with me being white and all.</p>

		<p>Anonymous. In Haiti the blacks (Africans) killed the whites (French) and then turned against the mulattos. Whites and mulattos were all killed. That is why Haitians are so black.</p>
