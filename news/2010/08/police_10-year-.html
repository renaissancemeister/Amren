<h1>Police: 10-Year-Old Gunshot Victim Shot Himself During Robbery</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Seattle Times, August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 10-year-old boy who suffered a gunshot wound in the arm Tuesday night aboard a Metro Transit bus in Seattle accidentally shot himself during a robbery, police said.</p>
<p>The boy, who is being treated at Harborview Medical Center, will likely face charges of robbery and a weapons violation when he is released from the hospital, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to new details released by police Wednesday, a 17-year-old boy was aboard Metro&rsquo;s Route 7 bus when he was confronted by a group of juveniles, including the 10-year-old. The 10-year-old ordered the older boy to empty his pockets while the other boys, ages 12, 14 and 15 surrounded the 17-year-old, police said.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old later told police he thought he was going to be robbed.</p>
<p>The older boy said the 10-year-old unzipped a backpack he had been carrying and reached inside. The older boy was afraid the younger boy was reaching for a gun so he grabbed him in a bear hug. During the struggle a gunshot was fired from inside the backpack, wounding the younger boy, police said.</p>
<p>The older boy feared the other boys would reach for the gun so he grabbed the backpack and ran out of the bus, police said. He was assaulted by the other boys after he left the bus, police said.</p>
<p>Police interviewed the 17-year-old and later released him. Police searched the backpack and found a .22-caliber semi-automatic pistol.</p>
<p>However, the 10-year-old&rsquo;s aunt had said Tuesday that the boy accidentally shot himself when he reached into his cousin&rsquo;s backpack, which contained a gun.</p>

		<p>Since the frisky &#8220;boys&#8221; in this little urban tale are not described in any way, it would seem that we&rsquo;re to infer that it was all the gun&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Yes, that <i>must</i> be it   &mdash;   we can&rsquo;t possibly blame these innocent children for such goings-on, so if we were to simply ban all those Evil Guns, the problem would be solved.</p>
<p>Right?<br>

<p>No doubt students of higher learning in Washington see the galling error in this story. Send that 17 year old boy to sensitivity training immediately. Such a display of ignorance and bigotry is shocking in this day and age. It&rsquo;s the very cause of &#8216;criminal&rsquo; violence in the first place. </p>

		<p>Blacks, with their magical thinking, come up with utterly laughable excuses for the reasons guns were fired.  On TV reality crime shows, I&rsquo;ve heard everything from the threadbare &#8220;The gun just went off&#8221; to the supposition that a pistol lying in a car&rsquo;s trunk somehow fired when a woman opened the lid!  One fool, trying to somehow weasel out of a murder rap, told cops he shut his eyes, pulled the trigger, and, upon looking, found the man he had faced lying dead on the ground.  It&rsquo;s seldom, &#8220;I shot him&#8221;, but rather &#8220;He got shot&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Whites never &#8216;surround&rsquo; and rob people in groups like that.  When white criminals steal, it is usually a nighttime burglary or stickem up at the bank.</p>
<p>I wonder why no commentator has ever pointed this out, that black criminals hunt in packs - in broad daylight even!</p>

		<p>The AmRen Community resents the Norwegians behaving with pathologies that are endemic to the blacks.  Their Norse recklessness is diluting the black monopoly on behavior that forces White Humanity to &#8220;atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges and by fostering Diversity and helping minorities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I know that the politicians are taking a lot of heat for spending too much money on frivolous liberal wish lists, but I think Obama really needs to sneak a few million dollars into his next big bill to fund firearms classes for inner-city children. At the present time their only mentor is Steven Segal, who taught all of them to hold their guns sideways and way up in the air. Is it any wonder that they often shoot themselves or the wrong person?<br>
Black children have historically been denied access to shooting ranges and their choice of firearms has been limited to cheap Saturday night specials. This deplorable racism cannot be tolerated any longer. Please help. Call your congressman today.</p>

		<p>A related article discusses the 10 year old in custody:</p>
<p>&#8220;But King County Deputy Prosecutor Julie Kline described the boy as a &#8220;danger to the community and a danger to himself,&#8221; someone who is no stranger to Seattle police. Since July 2008, when he was 8, the boy has been investigated 13 times for crimes that include theft, robbery with assault and robberies with a weapon&#8221;</p>
<p>A real little charmer.</p>

<p>While that may be true, it still doesn&rsquo;t explain why he reached for the gun during the robbery. But I&rsquo;m sure the judge and jury can think of a reasonable explanation.</p>

<p><i>the other two boys involved in Tuesday night&rsquo;s attempted robbery were the boy&rsquo;s older brothers, ages 12 and 14.</i></p>
<p><i>&hellip;According to detectives, the boy started robbing people with a pellet gun, and then graduated to a .22-caliber semi-automatic handgun.</i></p>

		<p>I grew up about 2 miles from Rainier &amp; Henderson.  It&rsquo;s in one of two majority-minority neighborhoods in the whole Pacific NW; the other being in Portland I think.  </p>
<p>All the old timers say it used to be nice before the 60s when it was almost all Italians.  Lower middle class but safe and kept up, not the decaying war zone it is now.</p>
<p>They really can&rsquo;t blame slavery and &#8220;the legacy of oppression&#8221; when there&rsquo;s no history of that here for blacks, and they haven&rsquo;t even been here in any numbers since they came up from the South to work in the factories during WWII.  It&rsquo;s like a mini-Detroit, classic example of how they ruin everything they touch in no time.  </p>

		<p>The number 7 bus route in Seattle was used mostly by blacks in the year 2000, so I imagine that by now it is even more a black-majority route.</p>
