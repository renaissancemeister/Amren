<h1><a href="https://projects.latimes.com/homicide/map/">The Homicide Report</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, August 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Go to the original site to make use of the interactivity features. When you click on one of the brown circles, you get a map of the crime scene and a list of the people killed in that area showing their age and the date killed.</p>
<p>There are charts breaking homicides down (January 1, 2007 to August 1, 2010) by weapon, by cause, by race (or ethnicity), by age, and by day of the week (Saturdays and Sundays are big days, followed by Monday).</p>
<p>There are also photos of the victims.</p>

		<p>Interesting, fully 10% of the &#8220;white&#8221; victims have blatant Hispanic names. Another significant percentage are Armenians of which I am sure many are recent immigrants.</p>
<p>Still it appears hispanics are 5+ times more likely to be victims of homicide in LA than whites.</p>
<p>Must be either racism or global warming.</p>

		<p>All of L.A. appears to be dangerous. It is interesting that the LA Times lists the race of victims and perps.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would live in L.A. for any reason. Murder, gang violence, earthquakes, muss slides, wild fires.   It is like the ten plagues all landing on one city. </p>

		<p>#3 Curious Quisling,</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to move to LA to experience the joys of diversity.  Mestizo gang violence is coming to you, wherever you are.  Nine people shot here in Salinas CA over the weekend.  This used to be a nice quiet town.</p>

		<p>As recently as 1960, South Gate was about 99% white and a very decent place to live.  Of course, that started to change after the nearby Watts riots of 1965.  It&rsquo;s now flip-flopped into a virtually all-hispanic city.  Ahh, the fruits of diversity!</p>

		<p>I have spent time in some of the larger cities in several 3rd world countries and I assure you that none are worse than downtown L.A., and its only getting worse.</p>

		<p>I went to the original article, and clicked on Beverly Hills: a place where I&rsquo;ve been taken to shop, since girlhood&hellip;a place we considered safe.  One murder near there really illustrates the myth of White Privilege, and the dangers we face living among non-whites.</p>
<p>Lisa LaPierre was the daughter of a woman who worked as a Baker in a supermarket.  Her father was a truck driver.  In 1994, she was working her way through Pre-Law.  She was sitting in a car with a friend, having gone with friends to West Hollywood, to see one of them home, safely.  A fourteen-year-old black gang-member-wannabe (who had already robbed several other people that morning) stuck the barrel of his gun through a crack in the window, and shot her in the neck.</p>
<p>LaPierre woke up in the hospital, on a ventilator&hellip;.paralyzed.  It took her fifteen years to die.  Fifteen years trapped in that state. We all pay &#8216;The Random Diversity Tax&rsquo;, at some point, or every-so-often.  I think Miss LaPierre paid the ultimate form of that tax.</p>
<p>White Privilege?  The privilege of working your way out of poverty, only to have EVERYTHING taken away, on the spur of the moment, by some &#8216;minority&rsquo; member on a robbery spree?  This so clearly illustrates what white people do (work, build, achieve), and what &#8216;the others&rsquo; do (take). </p>
<p>Thanks for linking to that article, with the excellent interactive map.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find many more stories there, almost as tragic.</p>
