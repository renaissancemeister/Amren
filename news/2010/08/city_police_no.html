<h1>City Police No Longer Enforcing Immigration Laws</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Sheehan, KDKA-TV (Pittsburgh), August 11, 2010 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that we&rsquo;re not terrifying that individual or stepping across that fine line of racial profiling,&#8221; Pittsburgh Police Chief Nate Harper said.</p>
<p>Harper recently issued new guidelines to his officers to no longer check the immigration status of a person and to leave enforcement of immigration laws to federal officers. Harper says police need good relations with the immigrant community and should not be feared.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very important that have communication  &mdash;  a very well-built bridge to all neighborhoods throughout the City of Pittsburgh, &#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to have to go into any neighborhood and not be able to communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p>University of Pittsburgh Professor David Harris who served on an advisory committee which drew up the new guidelines says they will make police more effective.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I honest to God believe that all local police should be trying to do something to stop illegal immigrants,&#8221; Rich Stanizzo, a labor leader, said.</p>
<p>He says illegal immigrants are taking American jobs and all law enforcement has a duty to investigate and arrest them.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you crossed this border illegally, that was a crime,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So they already have committed a crime whether it be the city, the state, this country. It&rsquo;s a crime. Somebody better start investigating.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in Brookline, most people who spoke with KDKA&rsquo;s Andy Sheehan say the immigrants have been a welcome addition. Missy Berumen says aggressive policing would ultimately hurt the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shouldn&rsquo;t be suspicious of the people. We should welcome immigration. We should welcome the people from different countries. That&rsquo;s what America&rsquo;s all about,&#8221; she said.<br>

<p>Well, since it involves a large urban area it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, because they&rsquo;re total disasters anyway and should be written off by every aware white as areas that need to go.</p>
<p>If this country DOES explode into chaos, I can guarantee anybody the large urban areas will be the first to go, reduced to ashes in the first thirty days.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll all look like Bagdad after a shock and awe attack.  </p>
<p>And the more mestizos there are in each city the fewer blacks there will be afterwards.  Another unintended consequence of the black and multicults desire to reduce the white power structure any way they can.<br>

		<p>Maybe they should stop enforcing any laws. Wouldn&rsquo;t want to strain relations with the criminal community. The Police Department is a good will hearts and minds outreach program, after all. </p>

		<p>This is kind of nonsense that you can expect from <b>unionized</b> police.</p>
<p>Once the U.S. military are allowed to form labor unions, the U.S. will be unable to resist armed invasion. Just like police  calls for SWAT team about each time they think that the suspect is armed, the unionized Army will call on United Nations to help them out of a dangerous situation. </p>
<p>And then they will try to be nice to the invaders so that the invaders are nice to them after the surrender. </p>

		<p>@3 Skip,</p>
<p>Know your history mister.  The Czechs were pressured by &#8216;extranational interests&rsquo; (Britain and France) unwilling to go to war with Germany for their own &#8216;distant guns&rsquo; economic and internal political reasons when Hitler told Henlein (opposition group CMIC of the Sudetanland with it&rsquo;s 3.2 million ethnic Germans) to stir up trouble in that area of South West Czechoslovakia.  He did and when the Czechs, forced to mediate by that witless carbuncle Chamberlain, tried to negotiate, Henlein came back with even more demands and public violence that effectively brought the country to the edge of armed insurrection.</p>
<p>Hitler then told Benes (Czech president) that he was invading in 24hrs if he didn&rsquo;t give up the Sudetan.  Benes did.  He then had to give up another 30% of the country to Hungary and Poland because they wanted to &#8216;protect their ethnic populations&rsquo; too.</p>
<p>About six months later, Hitler repeated his threat, this time wanting Czechoslovakia as a whole and though THE ENTIRE NATION STOOD TO ARMS, it was realized by the gutless parliament that the nation (such as was left) was too weak to form an effective defense.</p>
<p>Benes left for France and then England to form a government in exile.  And the Germans walked in to form what would become an SS Reich&rsquo;s Protectorate under the infamous Reinhardt Heydrich.</p>
<p>All of which happened in the period 1938-39, before the final crash of appeasement diplomacy over Germany&rsquo;s next &#8216;gimme or else&rsquo; bully politick: the &#8216;Free German City&rsquo; of Danzig, in Poland.</p>
<p>_At no time_ did the Czech peoples &#8216;invite&rsquo; anyone inside their borders.  And when the war was over, they politely told the Germans of the Sudetanland, many of whom had been there for 5-7 generations or more, to get the hell out.  Or die.<br>
We have created our own little Sudetan problem, starting in California and the American Southwest, now spreading through the U.S.</p>
<p>Mexico cannot possibly form the threat that Hitler did.  But at the same time, you people are fools if you think that standing alone, outlined as a unified ethnic/racial subgroup population, in rural areas, is going make you anything but targets.<br>
If there is a successful race war in the U.S., it will only be when whites look at their black, muslim, hispanic etc. neighbors in _urban_ areas and decide it&rsquo;s time to do something.</p>
<p>Only there will the collateral intermix be too dense for conventional military solutions of occupy and traffic-choke isolation control of &#8216;regional militias&rsquo; (see Iraq) be impractical.</p>
<p>And thus ONLY there, where the environment will make for a pitched battle, will racist determinism last long enough to mean much.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into Russia much except to say that, as a land of multiple enslaved ethnicities, there was never any real &#8216;welcome with open arms&rsquo; (small arms maybe) policy by _Russians_.  But at the same time, the German army defeated &#8216;The Russians&rsquo;, as an ethnic group nail that had no choice but to stand up and be hammered around Moscow, within the first 100 days of the start of Barbarossa.<br>
What won the war for _the USSR_ was Asian recruits.  Specifically Imperial Japanese Army cowardism.  And Siberian TVD troop transfers that that passive collaboration allowed.  Always amazes me how bully intimidation diplomacy usually buys weak friends and herd-panic enemies that eventually stampede elitist superiority with common drudge numbers.  And nobody sees it for what it is.  The strategic imperative of brute stupidity as envy of rational superiority.<br>

		<p>Good idea - cops should stop prosecuting drug users and drunk drivers in the name of keeping a good relationship with them - otherwise how would we figure out who sold them the alcohol or drugs?</p>
<p>Recently a man and his three sons were killed by a drunk driver - but why prosecute him when it was clearly the bartenders fault?</p>
<p>Let me break it down - the ONLY reason the cops would want a &#8220;good relationship&#8221; with the immigrant community is if immigrants were committing crimes - and if they are committing crimes then perhaps this country should reassess who they are letting in to this country&hellip;.  Ya dig?  Pathetic.<br>

<p>I am a Pittsburgher, born and raised. As it stands, this region of the United States has had the lowest levels of Hispanic immigration. They just don&rsquo;t have a foothold in the Pittsburgh metro area. They pop up here and there but they are usually stopping over before they mover further Northeast because this old labor/unionized town tends to be more hostile towards them. To say that to check immigration status is a burden is such a gross lie. What I see here is a DELIBERATE attempt to allow to give them a foothold to allow the chain migration to begin. Pittsburgh is one of the few cities left in America that has some semblance of community remaining. Who in God&rsquo;s name gives this leftist Pitt professor Harris the right to insert himself into law enforcement policy? Was he elected? NO! The progressive leftist social engineers see that they have to destroy community cohesion because it breaks down any resistance to centralized control. I hate them.</p>

<p>This will soon become the norm in every community in America.  </p>
<p>Who cares if the communists call attacks upon Hispanics hate crimes or acts of racism?  </p>

<p>Yes, you should be suspicious of people illegally entering the country. They are committing a crime and many commit other crimes too. Also, at no time has America allowed anyone from anywhere in any number to immigrate here. We don&rsquo;t need immigration anymore, we don&rsquo;t have enough jobs for our own people.</p>

<p>Know the facts or be silent. <br>
It is amazing how much German bashing goes on even on this forum based on ww2 crimes, of course most of the time without any facts behind them.</p>
<p>fyi:<br>
The &#8220;Russians&#8221; you are talking about were were Baltic people who greeted the Germans /their racial cousins/ with open arms after the Bolshevik terror which took place in the years before. The Russians tried very much into intimidating and replacing/murdering the original Baltic population. The short German rule was a relief for the Balts. Now more than 30% of the Baltic population consists of ethnic Russians, so I would have to say, the USSR succeeded in replacing the Balts. So much for your Russian people&hellip;</p>
<p>For the Czechoslovakians (CS) the situation is more complex, from wikipedia:<br>
The new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns or Ruthenians (4%).<br>
&hellip;<br>
Foreign minister Benes became the prime architect of the Czechoslovak-Romanian-Yugoslav alliance (the &#8220;Little Entente&#8221;, 1921-38) directed against Hungarian attempts to reclaim lost areas with Hungarian majorities. Benes worked closely with France. By a risky move in 1918, the nation annexed &#8220;Sudetenland&#8221;, a fringe region that comprised 3 million Germans, who opposed the annexation and were treated as second class citizens by the new government in Prague&hellip;<br>
The Beneš decrees which forced some 3 million ethnic Germans and Hungarians to leave the area and made the remaining rest to second class citizens are still legal and in power&hellip;</p>
<p>So from my point of view the Czech stole a part of their country from the Germans. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;So from my point of view the Czech stole a part of their country from the Germans&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, it was granted to Prague after WW I via the Treaty of Versailles:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;On Sept. 30, 1938, at Munich, Chamberlain signed away the Sudetenland rather than fight to keep 3.5 million Germans under a Czech rule imposed upon them at the Paris peace conference in violation of Wilson&rsquo;s principle of self-determination&hellip; six months after Munich, the Germans of Czechoslovakia were where they wished to be, under German rule&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Though Germany agreed to an armistice based on Wilson&rsquo;s 14 Points and principle of self-determination, millions of Germans had been consigned to alien rule. Some 3.25 million Bohemian Germans (Sudetenlanders) were handed over to Prague</p>
<p>Germans will be &#8216;second class&rsquo; citizens, President Masaryk told his parliament. Not a single German was in the National Assembly that drew up the constitution. Repeated protests by the German minority to the League of Nations were made &mdash; to no avail.</p>
<p>Lloyd George said the Czechs had lied to him at Paris when they had promised to model Czechoslovakia on the Swiss Confederation, with autonomy for ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>By the 1930s, most British and the Tory government believed an injustice had been done to the Sudeten Germans that must be rectified by diplomacy if a new war was to be averted.</p>
<p>When German troops entered the Sudentenland in September 1938, they were welcomed.</p>
<p>Chamberlain made the greatest blunder in British diplomatic history. He handed an unsolicited war guarantee to the Polish colonels who had just bitten off a chunk of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>With the British Empire behind it, Warsaw now refused even to discuss a return of Danzig, the Baltic town, 95 percent German, which even Chamberlain thought should be returned.</p>
<p>Chamberlain&rsquo;s failure was that he trusted Hitler at Munich &mdash; as his great rival Winston Churchill would later trust Joseph Stalin at Moscow, Tehran and Yalta&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Final result?  Fifty million dead, Britain bankrupted and her empire brought down, the empowerment of Stalin, the Red Army in Prague, Vienna and Berlin and Germany in ashes.  But Hitler was dead.</p>

<p>   It&rsquo;s not what America is about!  America is about liberty not open borders. A country without immigration laws is not a country, but a geographic entity of convenience.  During a time of high unemployment, who exactly benefits from immigration other than greedy, unpatriotic employers and minority-huckstering politicians?</p>

		<p>Guess which socially-constructed human category that is NOT race Nate Harper belongs to?  Although if he were white I would not have been surprised.  Conservative thinkers do themselves a disservice pretending that there&rsquo;s &#8220;the government,&#8221; and then there&rsquo;s the military and law enforcement, as though they&rsquo;re somehow separate and not perhaps the most important part of the governing establishment, seeing as how they&rsquo;re the muscle allowing it to get away with what it does, and therefore very very complicit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d wager that most white police will continue to serve their master when the chips are down rather than put down their guns, leave behind the comfy tax extortion racket, and get their hands dirty doing real work.  Don&rsquo;t ever forget it, and don&rsquo;t ever fool yourself into thinking otherwise.  Maybe it&rsquo;s different where you live, but it&rsquo;s obvious who&rsquo;s side they&rsquo;re on here in the liberal big city.  If they haven&rsquo;t woken up by now they&rsquo;re not going to.</p>
<p>And I agree with Janos, it always blows my mind how many of the racially awakened on here are still sailing murky waters when it comes to other areas of government propaganda, such as the reasons we got into another European war scarcely 30 years after the end of the previous one, and the festering issues left over from and created by the first war that helped bring about the second.</p>
<p>Look back 100 years and what do you find?  Smug holier-than-thou Progressives trying to remake the world in their image and blaming the victims of their shenanigans for being below the task set out for them when it doesn&rsquo;t work out.  Seems not much has changed, and that should make your antennae go up when it comes to the &#8220;official&#8221; historical canon.</p>
