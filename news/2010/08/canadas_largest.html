			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toronto Star, August 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mounties have wiped out a field of opium poppies in the Fraser Valley in a first-of-its kind drug bust that&rsquo;s also revealed a much larger problem within the South Asian community.</p>
<p>Police believe the flowers were meant to make the drug doda, which gives its users an opium-like high and is said to be commonly used by taxi and truck drivers.</p>
<p>Chilliwack RCMP say the illegal crop on almost three hectares was the largest opium poppy field ever found in Canada and the 60,000 mature plants were almost ready to harvest.</p>
<p>Cpl. Lea-Anne Dunlop said investigators acted on a tip and went out to the field, but they didn&rsquo;t know much about opium poppies and had to do their research just to obtain a warrant.</p>
<p>Their next concern was to act quickly, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came to learn that these actual pods full of seeds, once they mature, they can burst and the seeds can spread,&#8221; Dunlop said in an interview Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we really didn&rsquo;t want something that doesn&rsquo;t grow here naturally spreading across other fields in the area and all of a sudden we&rsquo;ve got a bigger problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>After gathering their evidence, RCMP hired a nearby farmer in the community, about 100 kilometres east of Vancouver, to plow the crop under.</p>
<p>Dunlop said it&rsquo;s obvious that with 60,000 plants, there must be a market for the drug and they&rsquo;ve been forced to learn more about doda.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest demand for doda is within the South Asian community, sometimes used within the trucking community or cab drivers. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly, but the indication is that it may provide some alertness or focus, that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said it makes her uncomfortable to know that a truck may be rolling down the highway driven by somebody with opium in their system.</p>
<p>Surrey-Newton MLA Harry Bains has been aware of the problem with doda for a few months, saying some of the elders in his riding came to him to complain that the drug was being sold openly in local stores.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone could walk into any of these stores, dozens of them in Surrey alone, where you could buy doda right over the counter by paying $10, $20. You take it and you drive taxis, big trucks or go on a construction site or on a roof top.&#8221;</p>
<p>He complained to RCMP, who he said didn&rsquo;t have a clue the illegal drug was being sold over the counter.</p>
<p>Bains said doda is slightly more difficult to get now that police have started cracking down, but it&rsquo;s still available and still cheap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s considered to be a poor man&rsquo;s drug, poor man&rsquo;s opium,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is very, very highly addictive and once you&rsquo;re on it, you&rsquo;re on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 31-year-old Abbotsford man and a 24-year-old Mission resident were arrested in connection to the grow operation and are due to appear in a court in mid-December.</p>
<p>Police say the owner of the field had leased the land to others and was not involved in the scheme.<br>

<p>In addition to importing themselves, we also receive the excess baggage in the form of <i>their</i> customs and traditions that usually conflict with our own. </p>
<p>This Surrey story is &#8220;small potatoes&#8221; compared to what&rsquo;s happened to Toronto with its own huge influx of NON-European immigrants over the past twenty years. Criminal shootings are happening every day in this once relatively peaceful city, and I need not point out to readers here,  the colour of hands firing those weapons. <br>

		<p>The Vietnamese in Canada are the marijuana grow-op establishment.</p>
<p>There are over 150,000 Vietnamese living in Canada. They began arriving as refugees in the late 1970&rsquo;s as the &#8216;boat people&rsquo;.  The majority fly the flag of the old republic. </p>
<p>Where they&rsquo;ve distinguished themselves is in the marijuana business.  They grow it indoors and out, and sell it all across Canada to organized crime distributors.</p>
<p>They use the proceeds as seed money to start businesses and buy property, laundering it clean through the books of small businesses, such as groceries, convenience stores, and nail salons.   </p>

		<p>The Fraser Valley is and was the Bible Belt.</p>
<p>I was there recently and I saw all these White<br>
Kids dressed like Gang Bangers. These are maybe<br>
Mennonite, Lutheran, Dutch Reform, Catholic, and or Anglo Kids.<br>
The Drug Problem is getting bad there. The Mainstream<br>
Media will barely touch the issue of the involvement of various<br>
Ethnic Groups in the Drug trade, and prostitution.<br>
Often the Media will place the bulk of the blame<br>
on White criminals like the Hells Angels.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a loss of Culture amongst White Europeans<br>
is also to blame.</p>
<p>The Fraser Valley another example of naive Whites being had by<br>
aggressive &#8220;Minorities&#8221;.</p>

<p>Let them grow all they want, so long as they don&rsquo;t infringe on anybody else&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from the Ron Paul school of thought that says what a person puts into his body is his own business.  If he wants to destroy himself with alcohol or drugs, that should be his own decision and the government should have no control over it, unless the person taking these substances ARE HURTING or COULD HURT someone else by what he does, like driving an auto, etc.</p>
<p>Rehab centers would cost only a tiny fraction of what we spend on the war on drugs and the prison populations would be reduced by 60%.</p>
<p>Legalizing drugs would totally eliminate every major cartel in the world today and would reduce crime by 1000 per cent.</p>
