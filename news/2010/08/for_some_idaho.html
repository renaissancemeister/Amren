			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessie L. Bonner, Los Angeles Times, August 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is little the International Rescue Committee, an Idaho-based refugee agency, can do to prepare its Third World clients for the vastness of the operation that is Oregon&rsquo;s largest dairy. But the 93,000-acre complex has provided steady jobs in a recession that makes it difficult for even highly educated refugees fluent in English to get hired.</p>
<p>Conversely, with the immigration status of industrial farmworkers across the nation coming into sharper focus, legal political refugees offer another option for employers.</p>
<p>Shiwakoti, 21, started the day with tearful good-byes to his mother and sister in the parking lot of their Boise apartment complex. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His family fled Bhutan under threat of death, left the Nepalese refugee camp for a better life in America, and traded their new life in Arizona for the cheaper cost of living in Idaho.</p>
<p>And here, in rural northeastern Oregon, the refugee group had found employment for Shiwakoti, his dad and six other refugees at the giant dairy in the Columbia River Basin. {snip}</p>
<p>Shiwakoti and his father, 48-year-old Bhola Shiwakoti, went to the Boise office of the International Rescue Committee seeking help several weeks ago  &mdash;  but they didn&rsquo;t anticipate this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boise just started bleeding jobs,&#8221; said Lana Whiteford, a hiring specialist for International Rescue. &#8220;Hotels and restaurants just didn&rsquo;t need us anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>A livestock manager at Threemile Canyon Farms heard about the refugees&rsquo; employment plight on public radio two years ago and contacted Whiteford. Since January 2009, she has helped about 45 refugees get jobs at Threemile Canyon and find affordable housing in nearby Boardman.</p>
<p>The dairy with a predominantly Hispanic work force now employees refugees who escaped political and ethnic persecution in Burma, Sudanese who fled genocide, Iraqis who were forced to leave their war-torn country for both religious and political reasons and Somalis who left their country because of ongoing strife and bloodshed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The men joined a third refugee from Nepali, two men from Burma and three from Somalia in this latest group ferried on the four-hour drive through rural eastern Oregon countryside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The work is difficult, and for the first two weeks their shoulders will most likely ache with soreness, said Ibraham Hassan, a 34-year-old from Darfur who has been working at the dairy for four months.</p>
<p>There is a simplicity to the lifestyle, Hassan said, the repetition of getting up every morning and driving 20 miles to the dairy, coming home to shower and eat and then going to bed. But he misses living in a city, hearing conversations in English.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, it&rsquo;s all in Spanish,&#8221; Hassan said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The International Rescue Committee has gone to great lengths to facilitate the refugees&rsquo; presence at the dairy, securing housing and transportation them.</p>
<p>Even so, there was initial backlash to their presence in Oregon. Threemile Canyon Farms was asked why the dairy was taking on refugee employees when the Portland unemployment rate had climbed into the double digits, said human resources manager Rose Corral. She said she told critics they should apply for the jobs if they didn&rsquo;t want refugees to take them.</p>

		<p>There is so little left to say.  We need Himalayan refugees like we need more Mexicans.  There is no reason those jobs can not be done by Americans.  More fifth columnists for the final conflagration.  It makes no sense, but what does these days?<br>

		<p>EVEN IDAHO NOW?</p>
<p>This is disheartening.  Wife and I recently decided we&rsquo;re going to flee Libtardastan, the land of Murray, Cantwell, and Gregoire (the Kotex Mafia), as soon as financially possible, because we don&rsquo;t want to raise our soon-to-be-born son in a neighborhood full of Mexicans and Somalis and send him to school with them.  </p>
<p>I grew up this way, went to school with a bunch of blacks and Filipinos who treated me like garbage every day and was told by the champions of diversity that I was &#8220;too sensitive&#8221; about all the &#8220;white boy&#8221; and &#8220;honky&#8221; comments, if not outright lying. It&rsquo;s not happening to my son.</p>
<p>We had Idaho at the top of a short list.  North Idaho is about 90 percent white, or more.  That sounds nice doesn&rsquo;t it?  Then I read this article.  Burmese and Somalian refugees in Idaho.  I just can&rsquo;t believe it.  Is there any place left for us?  </p>
<p>What are Somalis doing in Idaho anyway?  I thought they went where the social services budgets were highest. I mean I understand why I can&rsquo;t throw a rock down the street without hitting one here; the small city I live in is host to the airport and one of the largest shopping malls in the region, tons of tax money to fleece from profitable businesses and give to people living one rung above the animal level, but Idaho?</p>
<p>Maybe they just got lost on the way to Seattle or Portland&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>I am so sick of hearing how &#8220;hard&#8221; all these illegals and refugees have to work! Like us White Americans don&rsquo;t work hard and ache from back breaking jobs?  WE need to start refuting these lies and most of all send them all back where they came from. From Idaho to Oregon. Where to next? YOUR State?</p>

<p>I can just see the smirk on Jessie Bonner&rsquo;s face as she typed this up.  One of her articles of liberal faith is that these pitiable &#8220;refugees&#8221; are simply &#8220;doing the jobs amerikans won&rsquo;t do.&#8221;</p>
<p>But White amerikans were doing those jobs just fine before third-world &#8220;refugees&#8221; were given the green light to come and do them for pennies on the dollar.  Where were Jessie and Rose&rsquo;s crocodile tears then?</p>

		<p>Once, when I was unemployed, I went to a temp labour agency.</p>
<p>I was put on a crew of mainly black immigrants. The realization dawned on me that I would have done anything to not be working in that environment. Workmates are like a surrogate family, and I didn&rsquo;t belong. I wanted to be around people like me.</p>
<p>I left as soon as I could. When a workplace goes immigrant, whites should leave and go elsewhere. If you stay around you&rsquo;ll be giving immigration and multiculturalism undeserved legitimacy.</p>

		<p>  Greed and a false sense of guilt will be our destruction. There is no need to import cheap labor from the Third World to do low skill work. Currently, we have plenty of people out of work here in America. There is no job Americans won&rsquo;t do for a living wage.</p>

<p><i>The work is difficult, and for the first two weeks their shoulders will most likely ache with soreness, said Ibraham Hassan, a 34-year-old from Darfur who has been working at the dairy for four months.</i></p>
<p><br>
The work I do is difficult too, and there are times when my shoulders ache with soreness. And I know that the work OTHER white men and women do is way more difficult than mine   &mdash;   and sometimes downright <i>dangerous</i>, to boot   &mdash;   and THEIR bodies ALSO ache with soreness. In especially hazardous occupations, sometimes the bodies of these pasty proles even lose limbs   &mdash;   something unlikely to happen in a dairy. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for us white workers, however, we don&rsquo;t have trendy names like &#8220;Ibraham&#8221; or &#8220;Hassan&#8221;; and we&rsquo;re not from trendy places like Darfur or Nepal   &mdash;   so consequently NONE of us hard-working crackers will EVER be celebrated or pitied (or even MENTIONED) by the likes of the LA Times. </p>
<p>In the mindset of white liberals who write for the Moron Media (of which LAT is a textbook case), working-class whites can merely laze around on their sofas while large-denomination banknotes rain down from heaven thanks to some imaginary &#8220;White Skin Privilege&#8221; [TM]. </p>

		<p>#2: &#8220;&hellip; even Idaho now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be discouraged.  Southern Idaho has more in common with San Francisco that it does with northern Idaho, but it is true that the options keep shrinking.  For now, the worst areas of Idaho are a dream compared to the best areas of many other states.  </p>
<p>Boise is a university town full of clueless liberal Uncle Toms who want to be known as &#8220;one of the good ones.&#8221;  Interracial couples are a common site in the area.</p>
<p>Look for areas that are a distance from Universities, government work, or easy access to social services.</p>
<p>I understand your predicament in wishing there were nice places left.  Unfortunately, I overhear conversations between liberals all the time, and sometimes I&rsquo;m even party to them if they consider me a bird of a feather, where they talk about moving away from cities like San Franciso or Los Angeles to nicer areas like Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.  The don&rsquo;t consider that their ideology is what ruined California and now they&rsquo;re off the ruin another state.  Like Washington State, Utah, and Colorado over the past two decades, the libs will show up, ruin the state, and then move on until there is nothing left unfouled.</p>

		<p>Oregon is much more liberal than Idaho. It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all that refugees that originally got dumped in Boise move to areas where they can get more handouts.</p>

<p>- Why, oh why do they have to COME HERE to have &#8216;a better life&rsquo;?  Why not India, right next door, or China, or Indonesia of Singapore or Iran or&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, none of those countries want to take in foreigners.  Only white countries do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he misses living in a city, hearing conversations in English.  &#8216;Here, it&rsquo;s all in Spanish,&rsquo; Hassan said.&#8221;</p>
