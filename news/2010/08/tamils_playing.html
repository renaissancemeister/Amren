			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ezra Levant, Toronto Sun, August 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>How bad is life back in Sri Lanka for Tamil refugees?</p>
<p>Are they tortured? Do they have a well-founded fear of persecution?</p>
<p>Are things so bloody bad over there that we have to let a boatload of them into Canada, just because they showed up?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re told by immigration lawyers, bleeding heart politicians and fashionable journalists who don&rsquo;t believe Canada should have any borders at all.</p>
<p>But what about actual Tamil refugees here in Canada? How bad do they think life is back home?</p>
<p>As QMI&rsquo;s [Quebec Media, Inc.&rsquo;s] investigative report shows, 71% of Tamil refugees here in Canada think things back in Sri Lanka are good enough that they&rsquo;ve gone back home for a vacation.</p>
<p>Canadian immigration officials randomly surveyed 50 Tamils already here, who are trying to &#8220;sponsor&#8221; more people to come over, too. Of those would-be sponsors, 31 are refugees. And 22 of those admit to going back to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>That would be like Jews who fled Nazi Germany deciding to go back to Berlin to hear the opera. Sorry, it just doesn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>The Tamils are playing us for fools. They&rsquo;re not genuine refugees. Genuine refugees don&rsquo;t go back to a country that&rsquo;s persecuting them.</p>
<p>The benign interpretation is that they went back for a vacation. But there&rsquo;s the real possibility that some went back to help the Tamil Tiger terrorist group wage its war against Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The no-borders left has argued that because Canada accepted 85% of Tamil refugee claims last year, that&rsquo;s &#8220;proof&#8221; Sri Lanka is a bad place.</p>
<p>But that high number doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything about Sri Lanka, a place that the UN High Commissioner on Refugees says is so much improved that no country in the world should assume that Tamils are refugees.</p>
<p>No, what that 85% number tells us is that our Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), the independent judges who are supposed to screen out bogus refugees, is totally broken.</p>
<p>The IRB judges are letting almost all the Tamils in. And many of those they reject stay here anyway. According to Sheila Fraser, the auditor general, 63,000 would-be refugees who have been ordered deported from Canada are still here, and the government has lost track of where 41,000 of them are.</p>
<p>The 85% acceptance figure was suspicious enough, based on the UN&rsquo;s comments. But now that we know 71% of Tamil refugees travel back and forth to Sri Lanka, it&rsquo;s more than a scandal. It&rsquo;s wholesale fraud.</p>
<p>If Jason Kenney, the immigration minister, was responsible for that 85% acceptance rate, and the 71% fraud rate, the opposition would rightfully call on him to resign. But it&rsquo;s the IRB judges, not Kenney, who make the decisions.</p>
<p>Brian Goodman is the chair of the IRB. It&rsquo;s his job to make sure his judges are competent and skeptical. At least one of those components is obviously missing. Goodman must go.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just the start. The only way to restore confidence in the system  &mdash;  and respect for the value of Canadian citizenship  &mdash;  is to have an audit of every Tamil refugee to see if they, too, took vacations back to Sri Lanka, after swearing they were terrified to be there. Those who went back should be denaturalized  &mdash;  stripped of their immigration status and deported immediately.</p>

		<p>Why not ask the Sri Lankan government if these guys would be in trouble if they were sent home.  Of course, most third world govt would answer yes, so that they could receive cash infusion from their american transplants.  But it could at least be determined if they have pending charges, or if Sri Lankan law suggests their behavior would put them in grave danger if they were returned.</p>
<p>Really, though, who cares.  After all, they passed dozens of countries en route where they could have inquired about asylum.  QED, they are rats.</p>

		<p>The connection between 71% taking trips to Sri Lanka and false asylum claims is simple and obvious - now that it&rsquo;s pointed out. But it still took a smart cookie to realize it. Well done!</p>

<p><br>
Excellent point! No REAL refugee EVER wants to go back to &#8220;the old country&#8221;! </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that these Tamils, having recently been decisively beaten in their insurgency against the Sri Lankan govt, have been making noises about &#8220;taking their campaign to other countries&#8221; where Tamils have emigrated   &mdash;   notably Canada and UK. Nobody knows exactly what this means, but considering the Tamil Tigers INVENTED SUICIDE BOMBING (before Al-Qaeda et al.), what it could mean is that now that it&rsquo;s too risky for the Tigers to perform their terrorism within Sri Lanka itself, they may attempt some sort of &#8220;proxy terrorism&#8221; in their adopted countries in the West. Perhaps as a way of pressuring the govts of Canada and UK to &#8220;do more&#8221; to help their cause by taking the Tamils&rsquo; side at the UN, and so forth. </p>
<p>So this floating &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; who just landed in Canada&rsquo;s lap, not only aren&rsquo;t legitimate refugees, their number may well contain some individuals planning to repeat the kind of hardcore, high-body-count terror tactics they&rsquo;ve been using in Sri Lanka, to their new hosts in Toronto, London, etc. <br>

		<p>Idiots.  It&rsquo;s not whether they are in your country &#8216;legally&rsquo; or not.  For to make it a legaleze game is to play into the hands of those who would &#8216;properly certify&rsquo; your own disenfranchisement.</p>
<p>No, the reality is a lot simpler: If you or through you, your sons and daughters cannot see themselves interbreeding with a population they find physically ugly and socially unable to provide a good spouse for them (money earner, circle of friends acceptance etc.) then what you do when you invite &#8216;refugees&rsquo; of -any- race into your lives is permanently frission off a slice of that common economics pie you all benefit from.</p>
<p>Which in turn means that they don&rsquo;t get richer (because the slice still seems too small) you DO get poorer and then it becomes a function of non-whites breeding heavily in stressed conditions.  While whites hold back and try to conserve what they have against better times.  This Ice Age, arctic condition, survival benefit is a terrifying weakness when a combination of racial rectitude (i.e. the refusal to ethnically cleanse your living space) and racial intolerance (the refusal to assimilate) is placed against populations who favor R-breeding exclusively.</p>
<p>And to whom, familial loyalties exceed any moral/ethical lunacy in trying to impose rule of law as a common equalizer.</p>
<p>Pick your poison:  Kick them all out.  Or accept the idea of your descendants having brown skin.</p>

The Tamils are playing us for fools. They&rsquo;re not genuine refugees. Genuine refugees don&rsquo;t go back to a country that&rsquo;s persecuting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Of course, the Tamils are not real refugees! They&rsquo;re economic refugees who are coming to the West to improve their standard of living at taxpayers&rsquo; expense. We will only stop this racket when The West is bankrupt. I guess even that won&rsquo;t stop &#8220;our&#8221; government, as America is bankrupt now.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Tamils are only obligated to each other&rsquo; is what I was told by an anglicized Tamil at a time when 95% of Tamil students were in ESL classes. To Tamils, outsiders exist exclusively to be decieved, conned &/or ignored. </p>

		<p>JWB&hellip;your diatribe about Canadians was a little harsh.  All Western countries, the USA included, are being overrun by Third World barbarians thanks to our treasonous left.  Read the comments (they are, thankfully but all too rare, unmoderated) in the original Toronto Sun article to disabuse yourself of the notion that Canadians are simply content to watch their culture and civilization be consumed by these parasites.  Even the CBC website&rsquo;s comments section is dominated by readers voicing their disgust and opposition to mass immigration and Third Worlders.  There is definitely a cleansing wind starting to blow.</p>

Yes, and CBC was heavily moderating those comments (at least most of mine never made it through).  I&rsquo;ve noticed that now CBC is not allowing comments on any new article about Tamils.   And of course CBC will not reprint this article.  CBC is run by idiots.    </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t be stupid, JWB. As Sailer explains today, the Persian Jewish &#8220;refugees&#8221; from Iran regularly travel to Iran on vacation, for family holidays and the like.  Similarly, all those Cuban &#8220;refugees&#8221; who arrive weeping and crying on our shores (and get generous welfare and refugee benefits!) regularly travel to and from Cuba for exactly the same reason. It got so embarrassing for the US government that they made a regulation that if you are &#8220;escaping Cuban tyranny&#8221; and living off white folks&rsquo; taxes as a poor Cuban refugee, then you cannot go back for a fun-in-the-sun Cuban vacation for at least 3 or 5 years.</p>
<p>Of course the Cuban scanners get around it by sneaking off to Mexico, where they can get a plane to Cuba without a visa stamp.</p>
<p>Friend, all the refugees are scanners trying to live off white folks stupid enough to pay them. And it is all due to the UN and our dear friends who felt so rejected inthe 1930s because we wouldn&rsquo;t take them in and give them welfare in the Depression.</p>

		<p>This is not surprising. The two biggest Swedish cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg, both have regular flights to Tehran, despite the fact that these Iranians got perminanent residency by claimining they were refugees, who would be executed if deported to Iran. </p>
<p>Yet they will feel comfortable returning to Iran to see their relatives, despite the fact that according to their stories they would be immediately imprisoned, tortured and executed if they returned to Iran&hellip;</p>
<p>Iranians, Tamils and others must be laughing their heads off  when being told that naive Western immigration officials are actually fooled by this obvious scam.</p>
