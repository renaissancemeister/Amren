	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [An] Associated Press-Univision poll .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. examined the attitudes of Latino adults toward higher education. Despite strong belief in the value of a college diploma, Hispanics more often than not fall short of that goal.</p>
<p>The findings have broad implications not only for educators and parents, but for the economy.</p>
<p>In the next decade, U.S. companies will have to fill millions of jobs to replace well-trained baby boomers going into retirement. As the nation&rsquo;s largest minority group, Latinos account for a growing share of the pool of workers, yet their skills may not be up to par. Aware of the challenge, some California State University campuses are reaching out to Hispanic children as early as the fourth grade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, the poll, also sponsored by The Nielsen Company and Stanford University, found that Hispanics value higher education more than do Americans as a whole. Eighty-seven percent said a college education is extremely or very important, compared with 78 percent of the overall U.S. population.</p>
<p>Ninety-four percent of Latinos say they expect their own children to go to college, a desire that&rsquo;s slightly stronger for girls. Seventy-four percent said the most important goal for a girl right after high school is to attend a four-year college, compared with 71 percent for boys.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm about higher education hasn&rsquo;t been matched by results.</p>
<p>Census figures show that only 13 percent of Hispanics have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher, compared with 30 percent among Americans overall.</p>
<p>The poll revealed some of the roadblocks: Latinos don&rsquo;t have enough money, yet many are reluctant to borrow. Family obligations intervene. Parents and teachers provide only lukewarm support.</p>
<p>Fifty-four percent said their own parents either did not expect them to go to college, or did not care either way.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the poll, just 29 percent cited poor grades in high school as an extremely or very important reason for not going to college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Affordability was the top reason for not completing a college degree, cited by 54 percent as &#8220;extremely&#8221; or &#8220;very&#8221; important. Financial pressure is magnified by a reluctance to borrow that appears to be cultural.</p>
<p>Even among Latinos who are U.S. citizens by birth, only 32 percent said they had borrowed to finance education, compared with 39 percent of the general population. Aversion to debt was even stronger among the foreign-born.</p>

<p>or </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to make big bold announcements of future accomplishments, it&rsquo;s quite another to attend semester after semester, going to class and doing the work.  Many big talkers are limited in reading and writing skills, unlike their ability for braggadocio</p>

		<p>Steve Sailer called this story an example of the economic theory of &#8220;revealed preference.&#8221;  In other words, your actions belie your words.  You may say you want to get a good education, but unless you at first have the intelligence, then apply yourself with hard work, you won&rsquo;t have a good education.  If you goof around with video games instead of doing your math homework, then while you can tell a pollster all the live long day that you &#8220;want a good education,&#8221; your actions reveal that you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Same thing with our other favorite domestic minority group   &mdash;   They say they want crime free neighborhoods, but their actions are:  Voting Democrat, voting Obama, opposing conceal carry, opposing the death penalty, jury nullification, mouthing off at and/or suing white people who have to use the force of arms to defend themselves against their violent young male relatives, and so on.</p>

		<p>Fifty-four percent said that their own parents did not expect them to go to college, or were simply ambivalent; yet, 94% said that they themselves expected their own children to go to college!?! What is wrong with this picture&hellip;?!?</p>
<p>The supposed reticence of Hispanics resident in the United States to borrow money per se, whether culturally derived or otherwise, was noticeably lacking when it came to borrowing money to buy houses that those Hispanic borrowers simply could not afford on their own present and foreseeable incomes!</p>

<p>No, their only &#8220;aversion to debt&#8221; is when THEY have to pay the debt. They have no such adversion when the gringos have to pay the bill.</p>

		<p>I taught English composition in &#8220;higher education&#8221; (whatever that means) for twenty years in three Southwestern U.S. states, so, of course, I had many hispanic students. </p>
<p>I always thought that I was quite liberal in my approach to people; I thought that all students could succeed in college if they applied themselves. I now think that I believed that because I had gulped down the multi-cultural kool-aid that all public educational institutions force upon all of us, students, teachers, and citizens. Most of the literature I was forced to teach was non-White PC tripe written in the last half-century. The Great Books are ghosts.</p>
<p>I am today uneployed and have been for eight months. I know my subject well, butI am White, Republican, and Christian; that is, I believe I have no place in public education in 2010. In the last five years, I had been a finalist for many tenure-track faculty positions in the Southwest, and I was interviewed by Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, Turkish, and other foreigners (oops, immigrants) with accents so thick that I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend half of what they said &hellip; and they were the chairs of English departments at American colleges and universities. </p>
<p>At my last such interview at a mostly Mexican-illegal-alien occupied California community college in an agricultural desert area that is very near the Mexican border, I was told that I would have to teach the &#8220;New English&#8221;. The New English, I was told by the chair of the English department, required no proper spelling, punctuation, etc. I told him, &#8220;Of course, spelling matters. Of course, puctuation matters.&#8221; 10 minues later, he literally went to sleep, his head on the desk, in the middle of my interview. I was not hired. </p>
<p>I have seen colleges completely fall apart as we give free education to illegal invaders who lack the discipline and intelligence to write proper English. If they can&rsquo;t write properly, they can&rsquo;t communicate properly. If they can&rsquo;t communicate properly, how can they succeed in higher education? </p>
<p>Is it genetic/racial? Is it cultural? Is it nature or nurture? I don&rsquo;t know. I suspect it is both: the cause creates an effect, and the effect affects the cause, and round and round civilations turn. All I know is I probably will never practice my profession again, and I have no faith in the ability of most non-Whites (excepting East Asians) to master writing in English, what Ernest Hemingway called, &#8220;the hardest damned job in the world&#8221;. </p>
<p>Best Wishes from Arizona, where most illegals feel that they have won the SB1070 battle and where it costs $8000.00 per illegal child per year to attend public schools paid for by U.S. taxpayers.</p>

		<p>Hmm, on the one hand we read that:</p>
<p><i>Indeed, the poll, also sponsored by The Nielsen Company and Stanford University, found that Hispanics value higher education more than do Americans as a whole. Eighty-seven percent said a college education is extremely or very important, compared with 78 percent of the overall U.S. population.</i></p>
<p>Yet on the other hand, we read:</p>
<p><i>The poll revealed some of the roadblocks &hellip; Parents and teachers provide only lukewarm support.</i></p>
<p>Certainly sounds like a contradiction to me.</p>
<p>This obviously will require a few more decades of studies&hellip;</p>

		<p>How delusional of this article to think that this country will be same when the whites become the minority.  If the hispanics do become the majority look no further than Mexico, what this country will become.  Don&rsquo;t worry, there will no need for workers to fill highly technical jobs or colleges in search of students.  There will not be enough whites to sustain what this country was prior to the 1960&rsquo;s.  This country is finished and the election of a shadowy inexperience questionable if even a citizen black man as president is the symbol of that decline.   </p>

		<p>Part of the problem is that high schools push &#8220;college&#8221; to all students when about 75% of high school students (after the trouble makers and kids who cannot do high school level work drop out-usually in the 9th or 10th grade) would benefit far more from some vocational training rather than academic work. I would say that most Hispanics do not have the motivation or delayed gratification to stick it out through college to begin with. If they do graduate it is with some fluff AA degree in a subject like &#8220;Hispanic studies&#8221; or some other garbage and are thrown into a puff government job much like blacks who get the same sort of degrees. </p>

		<p>I have taught in schools with many Hispanic students, mostly from El Salvador, not Mexico.  They are far better behaved tdhan blacks including middle class blacks, and try at least to learn, unlike the majority of black students who live in the same or adjacent neighborhoods. The Hispanic kids also often speak a better quality of English than the blacks. </p>
<p>Oh the irony. </p>
<p>Some, not a majority, of my Hispanic students, mostly girls who didnt get pregnant, did go on to college,and deserved to.  </p>
<p>As for the Hispanic students who didn&rsquo;t, finances were a problem for sure, as it now is for many many white students. However the Hispanic/Salvador students in part face a dilemma immigrant kids or sons or even grandsons of immigrants faced in the past, whether Irish, German, Italian or Jewish. That is, the obligation of the &#8220;old country&#8221; generations to support parents and younger siblings. In one or two generations, I believe this will not be a problem for ambitious Hispanic students. </p>
<p>I also believe the majority of blacks, unlike a greater number than assimilated Hispanics, will flounder for endless generations. Their culture is not a cohesive, continuing culture like European Americans or  Latin Americans have. Of course our kids can reject European culture, including the culture of Spain that is imbedded in some Latinos, and sink to the ignorant, consumption oriented being of blacks. That will probably happen-check out how many white kids read books for pleasure, newspapers or even view educational or in-depth informational websites. And the white appetite for smoothed over R&B; and rap, (meet Lady GaGa) and Houston we have a problem.</p>
<p>But at least there is a chance of wisdom and success for some white kids and yes some Hispanic kids.  </p>

		<p>Do your own informal research. How many bookstores do you see in hispanic neighborhoods? Black ones? Apart from some small religious stores and some white run commie front places, the answer is usually zero. The locals won&rsquo;t support one by buying any books. This tells you what populations have an interest in higher learning, defined by me in this case as going higher than a 10th grade level of capability. Using your own eyeballs to put the pieces together is just so much more instructive than reading one garbage study after another.  </p>
