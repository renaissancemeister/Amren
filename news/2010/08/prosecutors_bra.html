			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Miller, WFAE-FM (Charlotte), August 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Death row inmates in North Carolina have begun filing motions challenging their sentences on the grounds of racial bias. Under the 2009 Racial Justice Act, defendants can use statistical data to show that racial bias helped put them on death row.</p>
<p>At least 12 death row inmates and dozens of other defendants facing murder trials have filed motions, according to the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s director, Peg Dorer, expects a flurry of challenges before August 10th. That&rsquo;s the deadline for death row inmates to file claims of racial bias.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Racial Justice Act {snip} allows defendants to use statistical evidence to show race played a factor in their sentencing. Kentucky is the only other state that has a similar law.</p>
<p>Since the law was signed last year, a couple of statistical studies examining the cases of the state&rsquo;s death row inmates have been released.</p>
<p>One conducted by Michigan State law professors found that people are nearly three times more likely to be sentenced to death in North Carolina if they&rsquo;re found to have killed a white person as opposed to a person of another race. The study also found prosecutors in the state dismissed qualified black jurors at more than twice the rate at which they dismissed white jurors.</p>
<p>Dorer says a couple of white defendants have already filed motions. The five death row inmates who filed this week are all African Americans who are convicted of killing whites. According to the North Carolina Center for Death Penalty Litigation, three of them were found guilty by all-white juries.</p>
<p>The inmates are asking the court to commute their death sentences to life in prison without probation.<br>

		<p>If this &#8220;Racial Justice Act&#8221; is meant to be taken literally, then of course whites on death row will challenge their convictions using it, because whites who are convicted of Murder 1 are more likely actually to be executed than blacks who are convicted of Murder 1.</p>

		<p>The only things the public learns on this issue is what the story here tells them. Why no information at all on the white death row inmates claims? Or comments from their lawyers or information on the legal briefs? To what do we owe this blatant ommission? Could it be Racism?</p>

The 2010 Racial Justice Act:  All &#8220;esteemed, courageous, heroic, pioneering, trailblazing, wonderful&#8221; Civil Rights &#8220;icons and leaders&#8221; must be held accountable to for the racial death sentences handed down by the &#8220;communities of color&#8221; to Eve Carson and Channon Christian, and for Detroit&rsquo;s becoming uninhabitable for civilized people ever since the blacks made life so miserable for White Humanity that we fled, and agreeing that the Congressional Black Caucus is a hate group for not opening its membership to people of all color.</p>

		<p>Well, sure they are filing!  Blacks killing whites has become an accepted pastime.<br>
They can&rsquo;t understand why they have to die when folks like those who did Christian and Newsome don&rsquo;t have to.  Nor can they understand why THEIR lawyer didn&rsquo;t use the &#8220;justifiable racism&#8221; card as is already happening with Omar Thornton through the media..  After all, in Black Run America it is obvious a white life is worth much less than a black life.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there isn&rsquo;t at least some truth in these claims.  I suspect that black murder suspects are more frequently represented by otherwise unemployable counsel from the PD&rsquo;s office than whites, with predictable results.  On the other hand, they&rsquo;re statistically also much more likely to have a long record of prior convictions than white defendants, making judges more inclined to issue more severe sentences.</p>

		<p>Well, maybe it would be possible to let them serve a life sentence in a Nigerian prison. It would be cheaper for us, since the Nigerians would ask no more than a few thousand dollars per year to take care of these murderers, and it would give the murderers the satisfaction of not being persecuted by us vicious, discriminating whites. A win-win situation! </p>

<p>Statistical comparisons of this type are totally bogus. There are so few instances of a white killing a person of another race that comparisons to blacks killing a white are totally unreasonable. The &#8220;population&#8221; [instances of a white killing a person of another race] are too small to make valid comparisons.</p>

		<p>These are the fruits of decades of Democratically led, politically correct progressivism.  Victims and the families of victims of these murderers will never find justice because anything that possibly could smack of racism (or the perception of racism) now trumps capital murder.  This is really a get-out-of-jail free card, not just the race card.  Residents of NC should fear that if they are victims of a crime, they may never receive proper justice in that state.  Best be prepared for that prospect.</p>

<p>Well, well, well, LIsa.  Now how did you arrive at the indisputable fact that the black prospective jurors were qualified?  If you relied on the study, then how did those conducting the &#8220;study&#8221; know that?</p>
<p>The fact is there more likely than not very legitimate reasons blacks are rejected for jury duty, such as too dumb to understand complicated testimony, or making it plain to an experienced prosecutor that they just might let the defendant go free if he&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>The best thing that could happen to these &#8220;researchers&#8221; is that they let all black criminals go free if they agree to stay in only black neighborhoods and then force the &#8220;researchers to live there too.</p>
<p>I think all black racists and white morons should get the world they want regarding race, but they should have to live in their creation.<br>

		<p><i>One conducted by Michigan State law professors found that people are nearly three times more likely to be sentenced to death in North Carolina if they&rsquo;re found to have killed a white person as opposed to a person of another race.</i></p>
<p>Maybe the reason is that a homicide where a white is the victim has more vicious circumstances than in a situation where the victim is black.  If the victim is black, then the doers are mostly black, and the black doers are protected murderers and prosecutors are scared to pursue the death penalty.</p>

		<p>The following statement from the article is a pretty loose one and I don&rsquo;t trust the motives of the &#8216;michigan law professors&rsquo; or the media representative writing the story, &#8220;people are nearly three times more likely to be sentenced to death in North Carolina if they&rsquo;re found to have killed a white person as opposed to a person of another race.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ignoring self-defense cases, manslaughter, criminal neglect, and justifiable homicide, this figure could even include policemen who have &#8216;killed&rsquo; a person, white or black, while on the job. There&rsquo;s no effort at all to get to the real story - and probably an effort in quite the opposite direction. Even &#8216;disreputable&rsquo; (and arguably biased) sources such as The Color of Crime make an effort to get to real, relevant, unvarnished statistics.  </p>
