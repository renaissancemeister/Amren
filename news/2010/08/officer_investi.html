<h1>Officer Investigated: Des Moines Police Sergeant Asked Officer to Release Suspect in Iowa State Fair Fight</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Brilbeck, WHO-TV (Des Moines), August&nbsp;24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As police are investigating a rash of what could be racially motivated attacks near the Iowa State Fair, they&rsquo;re also investigating one of their own officers.</p>
<p>One of the attacks occurred on August 14 in the parking lot of Gerry&rsquo;s bar. Witness Brian Ray Fees, a bartender at Gerry&rsquo;s Bar, says the attackers were beating the victim while shouting racial slurs. &#8220;Just kill the white dude. Kick his butt. That kind of thing. A lot of expletives too,&#8221; Fees says.</p>
<p>Hoover High School basketball player Reginald White was identified by the victim and witnesses as the ringleader of the attack and arrested. But according to police reports obtained by Channel 13 News, Police Sergeant Lillie Miller called the arresting officer and asked him to release White with just a ticket. When the officer refused, according to the report, Sgt. Miller replied, &#8220;Fine, I will just bond him out.&#8221; And, police say, that&rsquo;s what Miller did.</p>
<p>Now, Miller is being disciplined for not going through the proper channels in White&rsquo;s arrest. {snip} Lavorato [police spokeswoman Lori Lavorato] says it does not appear Miller was asking for any type of preferential treatment for White, who police say is a friend of Miller&rsquo;s son.<br>

						<p><b>Text of Press Release (scroll down):</b></p>
<p>Senior Police Officer Lillie Miller was promoted to the rank of Sergeant on February 9. Hers was one of five promotions made by Chief Judy A. Bradshaw. Miller&rsquo;s promotion carries the distinction of being the first African-American female Des Moines Police Officer to be promoted to the rank of Sergeant.</p>
<p>Miller received her Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree from the University of Iowa, her Master&rsquo;s Degree and a Public Managers Certificate from Drake University where she was also inducted into the National Honors Society for Public Affairs &amp; Administration, Pi Alpha Alpha, for her academic excellence. Miller joined the department in 1999, and has worked in several positions: Patrol Division, the Airport Unit, Inspections Unit, Office of Professional Standards, and is currently assigned to the Planning and Budget Section. Miller has also worked on a recruitment committee for the department. Congratulations to Miller and all officers who were promoted. </p>

<p>So, what we have here is the ignoble Sgt. Miller basically condoning in microcosm, &ldquo;a rash of what could be racially motivated attacks.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Big surprise!</p>
<p>Her actions are the typical and expected behavior of a Quadruple-A black, this being an: Affirmative Action African American. </p>
<p>1.) She has &ldquo;power&rdquo; that she neither deserves or really understands, but because she has it, she will use it without much concern for the consequences to both others and herself; </p>
<p>2.) The larger sociopolitical dogma of multiculturalism, &ldquo;edifies&rdquo; her in this arrogant ignorance of hers&rsquo;;</p>
<p>3.) Allow these two abysmal paradigms to interact and bingo, you have things like this &ldquo;kill whitey&rdquo; scenario that &ldquo;could be racially motivated attacks,&rdquo; go unresolved into a vortex of lunacy that gets to the bottom of nothing for the real victims, but encourages all (from high to low) who are the real perpetrators into a brooding stupor of self-pity.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Well us racist white people sure wouldn&rsquo;t want to derail young Reginald&rsquo;s promising rap or basketball career over something as trivial as attempted murder.  Let&rsquo;s hope that Reginald makes it through this trying time with his spirit intact so he can make lots of money and have sex with many white women.  </p>

<p>What does this tell us? Is there a pattern here?  Has the Des Moines Police Department gone all-female? </p>
<p>There was a time when police work used to be considered a man&rsquo;s job.  But that was before women were encouraged to get out of the house, find themselves, have careers, get tough,  and &#8220;be all the man that they can be&#8221;. Motherhood and housekeeping were disparaged as contemptible.  After all, any illegal alien can do either of those things (so let them have the babies and do the housework). And, of course, white men on the police force were redundant and needed to be replaced. What replacement could possibly be better than a black female with an affirmative action degree in Public Affairs Management?</p>

It happens.  As far as calling in favors go this one is pretty far down the line and there really isn&rsquo;t any professional misconduct here.  The kid probably got charged with misdemeanor battery where a cite and release is not uncommon.  <br>
With that said it is easy to see from her pedigree what her trajectory is, and she just got crazy street cred with the local black folks.  </p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t do anything illegal but the appearance that she may have to wrest this young &#8220;o-pressed&#8221; brother from the clutches of the man will be money in the bank for her.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Yes, they do. But the issue here is to what degree.  White cops would (or might) do a relatively harmless favor for another cop, if it didn&rsquo;t violate professional ethics; but most of them would balk at crossing the ethical line. They know better. Blacks are much less restrained by any concerns about fussy abstractions like  ethics. (And believe me, I know.)</p>
<p>John, you keep pushing the tired old, illogical, worn-out argument that blacks commit rapes, robberies and murders; and whites commit rapes, robberies and murders&hellip;. Therefore, what is the difference? They both commit rapes, robberies and murders.  Big deal!  So whites are every bit as bad as blacks.</p>
<p>You might as well say that ghetto blacks and rural Amish both commit murders. I&rsquo;m sure they do. But how frequently?</p>
<p>John, the issue here (which you are deliberately obfuscating!) is one of degree and percentages. And you know that. Yes, both races do these things   &mdash;   but how commonly?  Among some it&rsquo;s more of a rarity. Among others it&rsquo;s closer to standard.</p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;m not certain about the &#8220;legality&#8221; in Iowa.  But at the least, interfering with an arrest   &mdash;   which didn&rsquo;t concern her, which she had nothing to do with,  and was none of her business   &mdash;   was HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL and a breach of ethics. </p>
<p>For anyone else but someone like her, it could be a career-ending mistake, certainly a cause for serious discipline. Maybe demotion!  (She is a newly promoted sergeant, presumably still on probation. As such, she wouldn&rsquo;t have any recourse, any defense, or anything to say about it. On probation, you can be demoted for any reason.)   </p>
<p>However, I seriously doubt the Des Moines PD are going to demote their first black female sergeant. (Anyone else, yes.)  It just wouldn&rsquo;t look good. It will get political. They&rsquo;ll be desperate to cover this one up.</p>

		<p>This equation might be subject to a lot of debate, but:</p>
<p>Iowa = Massachusetts + Corn, with a dash of Sweden on the side.</p>
<p>Iowa&rsquo;s first round of white settlers were Puritanical/egalitarian farmers from New England, who wore their anti-slavery attitudes on their sleeves proudly.  Later waves of Scandinavians settling into WI and MN spilled over into IA.  Missouri&rsquo;s first whites were mid-Southerners from VA and KY, so this makes the MO-IA border sort of a Mason-Dixon line.  </p>
<p>IA is a fairly reliable blue state in Presidential politics, and even its Republicans are left-wing on race.  Some of the RINOest RINOs are from Iowa (e.g. Jim Leach, Terry Branstad).  And that&rsquo;s not even counting its hard core leftists (Harkin, etc.)</p>

		<p>This was taken from the comment section of the &#8220;original article&#8221;:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Sergeant Lilly Miller is a felon. She just got off probation for having marijuana, she has been in trouble for selling cops home address/phone ect, she has been in trouble for writing bad checks. Can someone tell me why this women is a sergeant or better yet why she is not in jail like most dirt bag would be. Oh and by the way she has bailed out many of the athletes from Hover high school when they have gotten in trouble.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Also noted was <i>&#8220;she only spent 2 years on the streets out of ten&#8221;</i>. (Translation: NO experience!)</p>
<p>It appears many questions should be asked of how this affirmative-action policewoman EVER got hired in the first place, and why would they promote her to police sergeant??</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of how depressingly low hiring standards have affected U.S. police departments.</p>

		<p>I can tell you exactly why Lillie Miller is a Sergeant and still employed.  She is black, She is a woman, and your government hates you and promotes the unworthy.</p>
<p>If not for EEOC and AA these people wouldn&rsquo;t be in any capacity of true employment and leadership, much less responsibility.  These people mean the &#8220;incapable&#8221; promoted only by law and not by merit.</p>

<p>You get no debate from me.  I find your social/historical analysis to be impressively excellent.  Right on the mark!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;IA is a fairly reliable blue state in Presidential politics, and even its Republicans are left-wing on race.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No wonder. Just like Canada, Sweden, Vermont, etc., they have had virtually no races to be experienced with. So they have stars in their eyes.</p>
<p>But live and learn. Unfortunately, people always seem to have to learn the hard way. And so it must be.</p>
<p>Those good anti-racist Iowans have conveniently forgotten their history.  It was the Indian Removal Act, the Mason-Dixon Line, and the severe restrictions on immigration (up until 1965) that made and kept them a White State. What they take so much for granted today did not come about by any accident!</p>
