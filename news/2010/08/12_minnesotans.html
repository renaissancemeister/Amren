<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A massive terrorism investigation reached deeper into Minnesota Thursday.</p>
<p>Federal officials in Washington, D.C., announced the indictments of 14 people  &mdash;  including 12 Minnesotans  &mdash;  for allegedly providing support to a Somali terrorist organization with ties to Al-Qaida. That number includes two Rochester women who were arrested at their homes Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Amina Farah Ali, 33, and Hawo Mohamed Hassan, 63, both naturalized American citizens, are the first women to be charged in what has been called one of the most sweeping counterterrorism investigations since the attacks of 9/11. They have been charged with fundraising for Al-Shabab, which the United States has classified as a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Holder said of the charges: &#8220;These indictments and arrests  &mdash;  in Minnesota, Alabama and California  &mdash;  shed further light on a deadly pipeline that has routed funding and fighters to Al-Shabab from cities across the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>That pipeline has led directly to Minnesota, where at least 20 young local Somalis have been recruited by Al-Shabab to go overseas and fight. Five have since died in Somalia&rsquo;s civil war. Another Minneapolis man, a convert to Islam, was killed. Five others have pleaded guilty to charges in connection to the case. Another sits in jail in the Netherlands, awaiting extradition.</p>

		<p>Last week the Star Tribune had a ridiculous headling about three &#8216;North Dakota men&rsquo; crossing the border into Minnesota and committed assualt at a house party. Reading the story, it turned out the &#8216;North Dakota men&rsquo; were Somalis. Labeling foreign refugees (and troublemakers) living off the dole in white areas like this is a pathetic attempt at trying to dupe readers into assuming the criminals are white. </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t these stories ever list the names of the government elites who approved the immigration applications and naturalizations of all these violent Africans?</p>
<p>There must be a story behind it all.  We know that the intent is to make America less White by making it more Muslim, but we don&rsquo;t know the name of the powerful people who administer the policy.</p>
<p>Who are they? We must hold them accountable to the failures of all their decisions. Or maybe what we call a failure, they call a success.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put them on the receiving end of the success.</p>
<p>How can a not white ever be &#8220;naturalized&#8221; into our White Republic?  Nature and Nation make that impossible. We are suffering from a severe, ongoing, and troubling corruption and toxic perversion of Natural Law.<br>

		<p>The worst example of this is in Australia where Hindu Indians are regularly being attacked by muslim immigrants.  I don&rsquo;t need to even repeat what the headlines routinely say.</p>

		<p>Lots more on Somali muslim and other muslims at this link for those that are unfamiliar&hellip;the videos, in most cases, are very graphic relative to the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; coming to our WHITE Christian communities soon OR NOW! <a href="https://www.truthtube.tv/play.php?vid=717" rel="nofollow">https://www.truthtube.tv/play.php?vid=717</a></p>

		<p>Do I ever read anything good about a Somali immigrant anywhere in Western society?  I can&rsquo;t recall a single instance.  What I always do recall is a reality TV episode in which a Somali was suspected of a Minneapolis murder.  He was one of a non-English-proficient gang of robbers who lived on the streets and preyed upon anyone handy.  The cops dug up someone who could translate English to this thug and brought him in.  When left alone in an interrogation room, he started throwing chairs and screamed, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a monkey in a cage!&#8221;  He couldn&rsquo;t even understand the concept of a modern society in which suspects and witnesses are questioned by police.  Of course, the cops in this particular city tried to reason with him.  I would have liked to have seen what would happen had this been in, say, Memphis!</p>

		<p>Right. In the aftermath of 9/11, and when the prisoners began first arriving at Gitmo, they said &#8220;Englishmen&#8221;, &#8220;Frenchmen&#8221;, &#8220;Germans&#8221;, &#8220;Swedes&#8221;, &#8220;Dutch&#8221;, etc., all being held prisoner. Persons maybe having a resident card or passport from England, France, Germany, etc., but not really Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst example of this is in Australia where Hindu Indians are regularly being attacked by muslim immigrants&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more correct. The media only says that Hindu immigrant students were attacked by &#8220;Australians&#8221;. NOT clarifying creates a very wrong image! Done purposefully too with intent and malice.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a fact:  The entity most responsible for bringing the Somalis to Minnesota is Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS).  The church of so many third- and fourth-generation Scandinavians and Germans in that state is laying the groundwork for their permanent minority status.  </p>
<p>LIRS has a website.  Write them.  Tell them what you think. </p>

		<p>Ive become somewhat of an expert in this field. The Refugee<br>
Racket is what I call it. There are 400 NGOs (non governmental<br>
offices) that make their entire living off bringing this<br>
trash into our country and BILLING the US taxpayer.<br>
Its a FOR PROFIT scam. These refugees are on permanent welfare<br>
and they have no intention of assimilating. The Somalis<br>
held their first conference in Toronto with the vow of<br>
bringing Sharia law to the USA and Sharia religious schools<br>
for their children<br>
Legal immigration as it exists in 2010 is national suicide.</p>
