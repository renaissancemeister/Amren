<h1>Doctors Brace for More Cases As Indian Superbug Hits Canada</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Mahoney, Globe and Mail (Toronto), August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least two Canadians have become infected with a dangerous new superbug from India that is spreading around the world, partly due to medical tourism.</p>
<p>The superbug, which is resistant to almost all antibiotics, has Canadian public-health experts bracing for outbreaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be others. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time,&#8221; said Dylan Pillai, a medical microbiologist at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just the nature of the beast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researchers reported dozens of cases of British, Indian and Pakistani patients who contracted infections caused by bacteria harbouring an enzyme called New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase, or NDM-1, in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Of 29 Britons, more than half had recently travelled to India or Pakistan and 14 had been admitted to hospitals in the subcontinent, where the drug-resistant enzyme originated, including for kidney transplants and cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>Two cases have been confirmed among Canadians who spent time in India. In addition, the drug-resistant infection has been found in patients from the United States, Sweden, the Netherlands and Australia.</p>
<p>The Lancet researchers called the superbug&rsquo;s spread a &#8220;clear and frightening&#8221; potential &#8220;major global health problem,&#8221; noting that pharmaceutical companies are not producing new antibiotics for NDM-1 sufferers.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a global level, this is a real concern,&#8221; lead author Timothy Walsh, a professor of medical microbiology and antimicrobial resistance at Cardiff University in Wales, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of medical tourism and international travel in general, resistance to these types of bacteria has the potential to spread around the world very, very quickly. And there is nothing in the [drug development] pipeline to tackle it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With only a couple of effective antibiotics, NDM-1 is one of the most difficult superbugs to treat. There are many more medications available for other drug-resistant infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s quite concerning because there are very limited treatment options,&#8221; Dr. Pillai said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re really in a tight spot here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a commentary accompanying The Lancet study, Johann Pitout, a University of Calgary professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, urged screening patients who undergo medical procedures in India before they receive treatment in their home countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The consequences will be serious if family doctors have to treat infections caused by these multiresistant bacteria on a daily basis,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>In an interview, Dr. Pitout said that his lab analyzed a sample earlier this year from an Albertan who contracted NDM-1 after being hospitalized in India. The patient has recovered.</p>
<p>At the time, Dr. Pitout, a medical microbiologist, was unaware of the new superbug. He said he &#8220;put two and two together&#8221; after reading medical reports out of Britain, where NDM-1 was first detected in 2008. He plans to publish a paper on the case.</p>
<p>As well, a Vancouver woman contracted NDM-1 in India, where she was hospitalized and treated without success, said Howard Njoo, director-general of the Public Health Agency of Canada&rsquo;s Centre for Communicable Diseases and Infection Control. In February, the woman came to Vancouver, where doctors found an effective combination of antibiotics, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This case was, in a sense, not unusual because of the association and travel to India. It still underscores the fact that we haven&rsquo;t had a case of this bug actually circulating in Canada,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Njoo said he was not aware of the details of the Alberta case.</p>
<p>NDM-1 is an enzyme that is produced by bacteria that renders most antibiotics inactive. It is commonly harboured in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. People infected with NDM-1-producing bacteria often contract urinary-tract infections, pneumonia or blood infections.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you get it in the hospital, this could be certainly a tipping point, and if the doctors don&rsquo;t have good antibiotics to resort to, it could be very, very dangerous,&#8221; Dr. Pillai said.</p>
<p>The spread of NDM-1 within health-care facilities can be curbed through strict infection-control measures, including patient isolation and hand washing.</p>

<p>So, then&hellip;this is a deadly &#8220;superbug&#8221; with a terrible potential for mass infection, while at the same time it&rsquo;s easily prevented by washing your hands.</p>
<p>Why do I have the feeling that the governmedia are trying to put a smiley face on diseases imported from their favorite nonWhite countries?  <br/>

		<p>Today a boat load of Tamil Tiger &#8220;refugees&#8221; from Sri Lanka (brought by human smugglers) has showed up off British Columbia.  Apparently a lot of them are sick with TB, and the Victoria hospital has opened a separate ward in preparation.  All the bills for their health and welfare will be picked up by Canadian tax payers, of course.  </p>

		<p>A lot of these infected folks had travelled to India for low-cost cosmetic surgery.  I hope they&rsquo;re happy with all the money they saved!</p>

		<p>A major element to this problem is the gratuitous abuse of antibiotics in the Third World.  A friend who once worked in Brazil was prescribed antibiotics for flu, which of course is viral in origin and thus not treatable with antibiotics.  This behavior on their part could not have been better designed to produce resistant strains of all manner of bacteria.</p>
<p>Here in the US, the problem is that antibiotics are fed in large quantities to livestock, not because they are sick, but because it seems to make them grow faster.  Additionally, a pack of blithering idiots in soap companies decided that putting antibiotics in hand soap was a wonderful marketing ploy.  Of course, that means resistant strains to these antibiotics are developing even now, which means those antibiotics will become useless fairly soon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a psychic, but at this rate, I foresee a day when hospitals will no longer conduct invasive elective operations because the liability risk for them - given all the multidrug-resistant &#8220;superbug&#8221; strains we&rsquo;ll have - will have become too high.</p>
<p>Even if our pharmaceutical companies voluntarily stopped selling their new products around the Third World, even if Congress passed legislation banning the export of new drugs produced via government-funded research, and even if the morons in the dairy, meat and soap industries changed their own behavior, a patent on an invention - like a new drug - lasts only 20 years.  This means that two decades after each new drug is developed, Third World companies could begin manufacture of them and their doctors could resume their usual wildly irresponsible prescription behavior.  It&rsquo;s a game that - in the long term - we can&rsquo;t really win.</p>
