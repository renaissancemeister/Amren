<p>LOS ANGELES, CA;  August 25, 2010: In a legal settlement responding to a Proposition 209 lawsuit by Pacific Legal Foundation attorneys, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has rescinded its policy of race-based discrimination in teacher assignment. Therefore, PLF announced today that it has dismissed the lawsuit as of this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using race to assign teachers to schools teaches the wrong lesson  &mdash;  that people are defined by their race,&#8221; said PLF attorney Joshua P. Thompson. &#8220;It is unfortunate that it took a lawsuit to prod LAUSD to stop this policy of discrimination. But the result is a victory for equal rights and equal opportunities. This case should drive home to all school districts and government entities in California that using race to make employment decisions isn&rsquo;t just wrong  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s flat-out prohibited by the California Constitution. Government and its bureaucracies are mandated to obey Proposition 209&rsquo;s ban on race-based discrimination and preferences.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>PLF: Leading watchdog for equal rights and Proposition 209</b></p>
<p>Pacific Legal Foundation is the nation&rsquo;s leading legal watchdog for equal protection and equal opportunities, and against race- and sex-based discrimination and preferences in government. In California, PLF has been the leading enforcer of Proposition 209 (Article I, Section 31 of the California Constitution), which bars race- and sex-based discrimination and preferences in public education, employment, and contracting.</p>
<p><b>Ward Connerly statement</b></p>
<p>In this lawsuit PLF attorneys represented the American Civil Rights Foundation (ACRF), a nonprofit organization dedicated to monitoring and enforcing civil rights laws at all levels of government, including Proposition 209.</p>
<p>ACRF&rsquo;s spokesman is Sacramento businessman and former University of California Regent, Ward Connerly. He issued this statement about the victory over LAUSD&rsquo;s policy of race-based teacher assignments:</p>
<p>&#8220;It grossly shortchanges the taxpayers, not to mention our students, when teachers are assigned on the basis of race, gender, and ethnic politics rather than competence. This legal settlement and the merit-based teaching that it encourages in the LAUSD are major benefits of Proposition 209.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>The discriminatory LAUSD policy targeted by PLF&rsquo;s lawsuit</b></p>
<p>The PLF lawsuit targeted LAUSD&rsquo;s policy of racial discrimination and preferences in teacher-placement decisions. Specifically, the district&rsquo;s &#8220;Teacher Integration Transfer Program&#8221; required the race of a teacher to be considered for any decision about a teacher&rsquo;s assignment, displacement, or transfer.</p>
<p>Under the policy, the district attempted to achieve an arbitrary &#8220;racial balance&#8221; among the teaching staff at every school. Officials aimed to have the percentage of minority teachers at any K-12 school or magnet school mirror the percentage of minority teachers in the district as a whole.</p>
<p>In practice, this meant that the school district would take race into account when deciding on a teacher&rsquo;s request to transfer to a particular school, or deciding which teachers would be reassigned when a school&rsquo;s teaching staff had to be downsized.</p>
<p>For instance, if a particular school needed more white teachers to meet the racial &#8220;balance&#8221; formula, a white applicant for a transfer into that school would receive a racial preference, while a minority applicant would get less consideration.</p>
<p><b>LAUSD&rsquo;s discrimination challenged under Proposition 209</b></p>
<p>PLF&rsquo;s lawsuit challenged the LAUSD&rsquo;s discriminatory policy in teacher assignments as a violation of Proposition 209. Added to the state Constitution by voters in 1996, Proposition 209 (Article I, Section 31(a)) provides that: &#8220;The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Originally filed in 2005 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, PLF&rsquo;s lawsuit was on hold for several years, while a federal court challenge to LAUSD&rsquo;s discriminatory policy, brought by LAUSD teacher Jim Friery, was moving through the federal courts. The Friery case was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. A year later, after discovery requests by PLF attorneys, LAUSD agreed to enter into a settlement in the PLF litigation that would withdraw the discriminatory &#8220;Teacher Integration Transfer Program.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of this week, all conditions of that settlement have been met, so PLF attorneys have formally withdrawn the lawsuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of this settlement, LAUSD has pledged to stop using the skin color of teachers to decide on teacher transfer requests or teacher reassignments,&#8221; said PLF&rsquo;s Joshua Thompson. &#8220;This is an important step forward in the cause of equal rights. Nobody should be discriminated against because of race or ethnicity, including school teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>LAUSD: the nation&rsquo;s second-largest district</b></p>
<p>The outcome of this case is especially noteworthy because of the district&rsquo;s size and prominence, and the large number of teachers it employs. LAUSD is the nation&rsquo;s second-largest school district in the country, with 617,798 students enrolled in grades K-12, more than 30,000 teachers with full credentials and more than 3,000 without full credentials.</p>
<p><b>PLF&rsquo;s history of defending Proposition 209</b></p>
<p>PLF has been litigating for years to ensure that Proposition 209 is enforced. In the seminal PLF case of Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc. v. City of San Jose (2000), the California Supreme Court struck down a racially discriminatory public contracting program as a violation of Proposition 209. Recently, in another PLF case, Coral Construction, Inc. v. San Francisco, the state Supreme Court upheld Proposition 209 against San Francisco&rsquo;s attempt to have it declared invalid under the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>PLF and Ward Connerly have teamed up on several cases, including the 2001 case of Connerly v. State Personnel Board, where a California appellate court held that Proposition 209 forbids employment schemes designed to maintain the racial or gender composition of the work force.</p>
<p>The lawsuit that led to LAUSD&rsquo;s ending of discrimination in teacher transfers is entitled American Civil Rights Foundation v. Los Angeles Unified School District.  View the complaint, settlement, and notice of dismissal.</p>

		<p>I disagree with how LA was appling this, but I don&rsquo;t disagree with using the concept of race as a hiring factor. At mostly all black schools, I would try to hire black teachers. At mostly Hispanic schools I would hire Hispanic teachers. Finally at White schools I would hire White teachers. It is a novel approach. it was once called segregation. I think kids learn best from those similar to them, ethnically.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #1.  It has been stated over and over again by BLACK organizations that it takes black teachers to reach black students.  Okay - so let all black staffs work in all black schools!  Then who will they blame when test scores remain down?  And if we apply the same logic in reverse, it takes a white teacher to reach white students.</p>
<p>Where I work, 90% of the students in the city are black, latino or asian.  Ironically, nearly all teachers are white, and this isn&rsquo;t because of some legacy thing where old white teachers are holdovers from when the district had a mostly white population.</p>
<p>Nearly all the teachers have less than 5 years exp. (because so many burn out and quit) and the vast majority of those are from the suburbs, exurbs or even midwest farm country.  Why?  Because this huge metropolis cannot groom its own teachers.  </p>
<p>Black culture here is disfunctional.  Latinos are newcomers so haven&rsquo;t had time to get a crop of thousands of teachers in the pipeline (though there is a trickle) and Asians don&rsquo;t go into teaching because they&rsquo;re afraid of the big and violent blacks.  (I am not joking.)</p>
<p>These young white teachers are like peace corp workers in Africa or something.  They wade in among the downtrodden natives, revel in their &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; culture (read: prpensiy for nothing but sex, song and dance) and burn out and escape back to white areas, though oftentimes having learned nothing.</p>

		<p>I think that the teaching profession remains one of the only areas where whites undoubtedly  dominate. In all my years of schooling, I had just ONE minority teacher - my (8th grade) Spanish I teacher, who was a mestizo Puerto Rican. This is truly unbelievable considering the fact that, in my high school at least, about 40% of the students were non-whites. My middle school was probably 50% or more non-white. Its funny, because most of the teachers preach their liberal attitudes about race, and of course one would assume affirmative action would cause there to be a LOT more minority teachers in such a diverse town as the one I live in. </p>

<p>The average age of non-whites is younger than that of whites. Because young people of all races earn less money on average than those who will older and of course those younger than 18 often earn not money at all the job of these affirmative action czards will never be done. This may be however, also an example of non-whites falling behind and not earning nearly enough teaching degrees as compared to whites. There may also be a gender element to this. More girls are going on to college than boys. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has rescinded its policy of race-based discrimination in teacher assignment&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This policy kept me in an inner-city, majority black school for nine long years. My White face was needed to keep the staff racially balanced.  </p>
<p>The only escape was to resign, which some White teachers did, others, without notice, and when they&rsquo;d had enough (which I assure you doesn&rsquo;t doesn&rsquo;t take long) walked out the door, eyes straight ahead, got into their cars and never looked back.</p>
<p>It is also implicitly understood by administrators that White teachers stabilize schools  &mdash;   by doing such things as showing up on time, not complaining (because we&rsquo;re accused of either racism or not understanding &#8216;people of color&rsquo;), not calling in sick for days or weeks at a time, being in our classrooms during class time, maintaining a roll book, turning in grades, reporting attendance every period as is required.  In other words, doing what we&rsquo;re paid to do.</p>
<p>I assume the LAUSD will not share this &#8216;defeat&rsquo; with the teaching staff and continue to assign teachers based on race unless and until they&rsquo;re called on it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know which state you live in, but here in California, teachers must pass a very basic reading and writing &#8216;teachers&rsquo; test&rsquo; before they receive their credentials.</p>
<p>The old test, NTE (National Teachers&rsquo; Exam) was scrapped because non-Whites could not pass it, because it was &#8216;racist&rsquo; you see.  Teachers in California now must pass the dumbed down CBEST test, a test that &#8216;proves&rsquo; teachers have basic skills in math and reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;California state records show that the pass rate for whites is 80%, but only 35% for African-Americans, 49% for Latinos&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, despite many legal challenges by various non-White groups, the courts, including the Ninth-Circus, have upheld the validity of tests of basic skills for California teachers. </p>
<p>As for Prop 209 and PLF&rsquo;s valiant effort to uphold the tenant of Equal Treatment Under the Law:</p>
<p><br/>
SAN FRANCISCO, CA;  August 2, 2010:  The California Supreme Court today rejected San Francisco&rsquo;s attempt to get Proposition 209 declared unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Today, ruling in a lawsuit by Pacific Legal Foundation attorneys against San Francisco&rsquo;s the state Supreme Court rejected the city&rsquo;s contention that Proposition 209 violates the U.S. Constitution by allegedly targeting minority groups and limiting their ability to vindicate their rights.</p>
<p>Any attempt to circumvent Prop 209 should be laughed immediately out of court, but Marxists continue to try to twist the Constitution, Law, common sense and fairness in order to implement and enforce Anti-White AA.</p>
<p>As demographics continue to change in California, the White-hating Marxists will eventually win, Prop 209 will be declared Unconstitutional and race-based mandates in college admissions, hiring and promotions will be implemented with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Count on it.</p>

<p>You are so right.  I&rsquo;ve worked in two different public schools and pretty much all the non-white teachers were trouble-makers, had bad work ethics, called in sick all the time, etc.  </p>
<p>On a similar note, black female teachers can get away with things that would get ANY white teacher disciplined/fired on the spot.  Every black female teacher I have seen (save for one who was an Oreo) was LOUD, brash, willful, cussed up a storm IN CLASS, would slap students on their backs freely when frustrated with them, would throw things and scream at students, wore outlandish ghetto fabulous clothing and carried an air of THE DIVA about them that was unreal.</p>
<p>To be fair, some of the youngest white female, uber liberal, teachers also had their foibles (like wearing flip flops and T-shirts to work, not keeping records or having lesson plans, being sloppy, whiney, freely touching, hugging, fondling the big black and latino men, er, I mean overage students, etc)</p>
<p>In my experience, it is white males who are the best teachers of any race (both from my days as a student to my current days working in public schools and seeing how each sub group of teachers acts.)</p>
