<h1>Arizona Sheriff: &#8216;Our Own Government Has Become Our Enemy&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, Cybercast News Service, August 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pinal County (Ariz.) Sheriff Paul Babeu is hopping mad at the federal government.</p>
<p>Babeu told CNSNews.com that rather than help law enforcement in Arizona stop the hundreds of thousands of people who come into the United States illegally, the federal government is targeting the state and its law enforcement personnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s very troubling is the fact that at a time when we in law enforcement and our state need help from the federal government, instead of sending help they put up billboard-size signs warning our citizens to stay out of the desert in my county because of dangerous drug and human smuggling and weapons and bandits and all these other things and then, behind that, they drag us into court with the ACLU,&#8221; Babeu said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;So who has partnered with the ACLU?&#8221; Babeu said in a telephone interview with CNSNews.com. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the president and (Attorney General) Eric Holder himself. And that&rsquo;s simply outrageous.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Our own government has become our enemy and is taking us to court at a time when we need help,&#8221; Babeu said.</p>
<p>Babeu and Sheriff Larry Dever of Cochise County Ariz., spoke by phone with CNSNews.com last week about the May 17 ACLU class-action lawsuit, which charges the law uses racial profiling and named the county attorneys and sheriffs in all 15 Arizona counties as defendants. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit on July 6, charging the Arizona law preempted the federal government&rsquo;s sole right to enforce immigration law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), about 250,000 people were detained in Arizona in the last 12 months for being in the country illegally. Babeu said that that number only reflects the number of people detained and that thousands more enter the country illegally each year.</p>
<p>The CBP also reports that 17 percent of those detained already have a criminal record in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dever has hired an independent attorney to represent him in the ACLU case and his attorney has already filed a motion of intervention in the DOJ lawsuit so the &#8220;(Dever) will have a seat at the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Web site also has been launched by the non-profit, Iowa-based Legacy Foundation to raise money for the Babeu&rsquo;s and Dever&rsquo;s legal defense.</p>

		<p>The only changes that this country will see is the downfall of this country.  This country has been sliding backwards since the 1960&rsquo;s, too absorbed with civil rights.  Dumbing down of everything in this country to accommodate the blacks.  The average citizen sees it but is powerless to stop it and big money knows it.  Expect more corruption (stealing) until this country is gone.  Wonder why Rangel/Waters is being put out now.  There is nothing left of this country.  It is running on air.  The deficit alone will finish this country.  Perhaps, when the whites re-group to form another country, better standards will be installed to decide who is let in and should be in government.  Civilizations may crash, but progress in religion and science will not stop, unless black genes dominant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  &mdash;  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,  &mdash;  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.&#8221;  - Preamble to the Declaration of Independence; July 4th, 1776.</p>
<p><br>
This government became &#8220;destructive of these ends&#8221; starting way back in 1954.  Of course, anyone who knows American history knows that Thomas Jefferson, who wrote &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221;, was not in any way advocating the Babylonish society we have now.  Quite the opposite, in fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them. It is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably and in such slow degree as that the evil will wear off insensibly, and their place be pari passu filled up by free white laborers.&#8221;  - Thomas Jefferson; July 21st, 1821.</p>
<p><br>
What&rsquo;s playing itself out right now in Arizona is the last opportunity for Whites to secure for themselves and their posterity a place in this country founded by their racial kinsmen.  Don&rsquo;t let it slip away, people!</p>

<p>Absolutely correct, and the sooner people come to that realization the sooner we can get busy seceding and/or preparing for eventual economic collapse and civil war.</p>
<p>For the last MANY years the government was an entity all in itself, separate and apart from the people it lords over, and is no more than a giant beast that presses for more power and growth.  It is also an empire.</p>
<p>But, this present one outdoes all the rest in its audacity of hatred against whites and its desire to diminish the white population and transfer of its wealth to blacks and other non-whites.  Unchecked non-white immigration is part of their agenda to see that those things occur.</p>
<p>Any society that has a large population of blacks is one that is destined to fall.</p>

		<p>Sheriff Babeu is absolutely correct, and I can&rsquo;t even imagine his frustration in wanting to do a job, being expected to do a job, but not being allowed to do that job. Our government has indeed become our enemy, and that government has gotten substantially larger under this administration, with still two and a half years to go. The many years of brainwashing the American people has indeed reached the tipping point, and the inevitable final confrontation of American patriots verses the rest is nearing. I&rsquo;m grateful that I&rsquo;m not my grandchildrens&rsquo; ages - this [former] country will be hell on earth.</p>

<p>This reminds me of this week&rsquo;s episode of Mad Men. At the Christmas party, Bert Cooper complains to a guest that &#8220;civil rights is the beginning of a slippery slope.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love this program. It&rsquo;s full of nostalgia for a simpler and happier time. Passage of the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; legislation truly was the beginning of the slow death of this era.</p>

<p>It seems to me that what conservatives &mdash; real conservatives &mdash; need is their own alternative to the ACLU. </p>
<p>The very name of the organization, &#8220;American Civil Liberties Union,&#8221; implies that they are the red-blooded final arbiter of all that is good and just in this country, maybe even that they are an official government agency, when in reality they are simply a mouthpiece of the radical far left, and are extremely selective about what cases they consider to be a violation of &#8220;American Civil Liberties.&#8221; </p>
<p>The very fact that illegal aliens, who are by definition not American, and therefore do not and cannot possess &#8220;American civil liberties&#8221; are defended by this group shows just how corrupt it is. </p>
<p>Even though many Americans see through the charade, many others are taken in by the name of the organization. This is why I say we need a real conservative counterpart. Then again, maybe there already is one, and we just never hear about it because the MSM censors all mention of it.</p>

		<p>Someone should file class action law suits against the ACLU, La Raza and all other advocates of illegal immigration, on grounds of criminal conspiracy to violate US immigration laws.  File it under RICO so that they will have to pay triple damages.  Sue Obama administration and all officials of &#8220;sanctuary cities.&#8221;  Memebers of the plaintiff class are the American people, hospital ERs paying for illegal aliens&rsquo; care, union members who are displaced by illegal aliens, and anyone else anyone can think of.<br>

		<p>Re #2 anonymous:</p>
<p>Well spake.  The Founders, while for the most part being opposed to slavery, had few if any illusions about the nature of the black African races.  The Great Emancipator himself, Honest Abe, had no hope of blacks being able to live peaceably and and productively in our midst and had actually appointed a cabinet member to formulate plans to export all people of color back Africa, Central America, or the Caribbean.  </p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth, well-intentioned though he may have been, consigned us all to racial conflict forever more.</p>

<p>There is a true Conservative counterpart to the Communist ACLU. It is called the American Center for Law and Justice,or ACLJ, and they have filed many Briefs in the U.S. Supreme Court, and have succeeded in Court, for their many Clients, such has Veterans groups that wanted the World War I Cross, to be maintained at the Government Cemetary, in the Mojave Destert.</p>
<p>Not too long after the positive Supreme Court ruling, thieves stole that Cross from the Cemetary, further spitting on the memories of the dead Veterans that served this Nation in its hour of need.</p>
<p>There is also the United States Justice Foundation, which had filed many legal challenges to Barry&rsquo;s Inaguration, prior to it occurring, and continues to file Legal Briefs against this suspected non-Citizen, who occupies the White House, to obtain all of his yet to be released records. </p>

		<p>Ranger #3: There are two videos on You Tube that are worth your time viewing. You need to type in, &#8220;Remember Who We Are&#8221;, which is a stirring video for any Patriotic American, and then type in &#8220;The Government Can&#8221;. </p>
<p>The second video was sent to me by a friend, and is very funny, yet, hits the nail on the head, in its format. </p>
<p>I am waiting for one, or both, to be picked up by Conservative, and Constitutionalist Candidates&rsquo; Campaigns, in their Ads. </p>

		<p>Babeau is a Republican from Massachusettes and a great patriot.  I believe his choose to go to the border, to serve as sheriff, was a wise political move, as well as dangerous.  Paul has a resume that would make Teddy Rosservelt proud.  Google his name, the honor and distintion make Obama look like a high school drop-out.  I just hope, if he seeks national office, he is able to see the forest and the trees.  </p>

<p>Agreed. We cannot simply rely on the legislature to pass laws. We also have to be prepared to fight in the courts, and take it to the streets in protest. </p>
