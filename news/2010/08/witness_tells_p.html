<h1>Witness Tells Police: Man Kills Roommate, Drinks Victim&rsquo;s Blood</h1>
 

<p>Josh Poltilove, Tampa Tribune, August 4, 2010</p>

</div> 



<p>A Bartow man fatally stabbed his roommate and drank the victim&rsquo;s blood, an eyewitness told police.</p>
<p>Mauricio Mendez Lopez, 42, was arrested Wednesday night by Bartow police. He is facing charges including second-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, felony battery and two counts of aggravated assault.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Macario Luna Cruz, 32, was slain Sunday night in his home, 1055 Martin Luther King Blvd.</p>
<p>A witness, identified by police as Mirella Mendez, told investigators that Lopez carried a knife in his right hand and a drinking glass coated in blood in his left hand, a Bartow police affidavit states.</p>
<p>Before fleeing, Lopez &#8220;raised the glass in the air and said aloud, &#8216;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is my secret&rsquo; and laughed as he ran away from the residence,&#8221; according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>The witness told investigators that &#8220;a ritual in Mexico involves the person drinking the blood from a murder victim to prevent law enforcement from being able to find and prosecute them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Investigators said that on Sunday night, Lopez stabbed Cruz&rsquo;s brother, Juan, in the lower back, causing a minor injury, and then returned to the Bartow home and fatally stabbed Macario Cruz. The witness entered the home and saw Macario Cruz in a large pool of blood on the kitchen floor, the affidavit states. Cruz &#8220;told her to take care of herself and her children and then closed his eyes.&#8221;</p>
