<h1><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10925411">New &#8216;Superbug&rsquo; Found in UK Hospitals</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Roberts, BBC News, August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new superbug that is resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics has entered UK hospitals, experts warn.</p>
<p>They say bacteria that make an enzyme called NDM-1 have travelled back with NHS patients who went abroad to countries like India and Pakistan for treatments such as cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>Although there have only been about 50 cases identified in the UK so far, scientists fear it will go global.</p>
<p>Tight surveillance and new drugs are needed says Lancet Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>NDM-1 can exist inside different bacteria, like E.coli, and it makes them resistant to one of the most powerful groups of antibiotics  &mdash;  carbapenems.</p>
<p>These are generally reserved for use in emergencies and to combat hard-to-treat infections caused by other multi-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>And experts fear NDM-1 could now jump to other strains of bacteria that are already resistant to many other antibiotics.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this could produce dangerous infections that would spread rapidly from person to person and be almost impossible to treat.</p>
<p>At least one of the NDM-1 infections the researchers analysed was resistant to all known antibiotics.</p>
<p>Similar infections have been seen in the US, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands and international researchers say that NDM-1 could become a major global health problem.</p>
<p>Infections have already been passed from patient to patient in UK hospitals.</p>
<p>Map showing infection hotspots in the UK and India</p>
<p>The way to stop NDM-1, say researchers, is to rapidly identify and isolate any hospital patients who are infected.</p>
<p>Normal infection control measures, such as disinfecting hospital equipment and doctors and nurses washing their hands with antibacterial soap, can stop the spread.</p>
<p>And currently, most of the bacteria carrying NDM-1 have been treatable using a combination of different antibiotics.</p>
<p>The Indian health ministry and the medical fraternity are yet to see the Lancet report but doctors in India say they are not surprised by the discovery of the new superbug.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is little drug control in India and an irrational use of antibiotics,&#8221; Delhi-based Dr Arti Vashisth told the BBC.</p>
<p>Doctors say common antibiotics have become ineffective in India partly because people can buy them over the counter and indulge in self-medication. They also take small doses and discontinue treatment.</p>
<p>Gastroenterologist Vishnu Chandra Agarwal says in the past year he has come across many patients with E.coli infections who have not responded to regular antibiotics.</p>
<p>&#8220;In about a dozen cases, I have used a chemical  &mdash;  furadantin  &mdash;  to treat my patients. And it has worked. It makes them horribly nauseous, but it works,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>But the potential of NDM-1 to become endemic worldwide is &#8220;clear and frightening&#8221;, say the researchers in The Lancet infectious diseases paper.</p>
<p>The research was carried out by experts at Cardiff University, the Health Protection Agency and international colleagues.</p>
<p>Dr David Livermore, one of the researchers and who works for the UK&rsquo;s Health Protection Agency (HPA), said: &#8220;There have been a number of small clusters within the UK, but far and away the greater number of cases appear to be associated with travel and hospital treatment in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>&#8220;This type of resistance has become quite widespread there.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fear would be that it gets into a strain of bacteria that is very good at being transmitted between patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the threat was a serious global public health problem as there are few suitable new antibiotics in development and none that are effective against NDM-1.</p>
<p>The Department of Health has already put out an alert on the issue, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We issue these alerts very sparingly when we see new and disturbing resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Travel history</b></p>
<p>The National Resistance Alert came in 2009 after the HPA noted an increasing number of cases  &mdash;  some fatal  &mdash;  emerging in the UK.</p>
<p>The Lancet study looked back at some of the NDM-1 cases referred to the HPA up to 2009 from hospitals scattered across the UK.</p>
<p>At least 17 of the 37 patients they studied had a history of travelling to India or Pakistan within the past year, and 14 of them had been admitted to a hospital in these countries  &mdash;  many for cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>For some of the patients the infection was mild, while others were seriously ill, and some with blood poisoning.</p>
<p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said: &#8220;We are working with the HPA on this issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospitals need to ensure they continue to provide good infection control to prevent any spread, consider whether patients have recently been treated abroad and send samples to HPA for testing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far there has only been a small number of cases in UK hospital patients. The HPA is continuing to monitor the situation and we are investigating ways of encouraging the development of new antibiotics with our European colleagues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Welsh Assembly Government said it would be &#8220;fully considering&#8221; the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NHS in Wales is used to dealing with multi-resistant bacteria using standard microbiological approaches, and would deal with any new bacteria in a similar way,&#8221; said a spokesperson.</p>

		<p>One way to stop the spread of such diseases would be to force the islamic female doctors and nurses to wear short sleeves when working with patients. </p>
<p>Also, they should force the staff to wash their hands with antibacterial soap, clean the floors, sterilize the walls/beds/furniture, etc.</p>
<p>You know, use proper hygiene in a hospital which people in the West knew how to do over 900 years ago!</p>

		<p>Using antibiotics does not cause anti-biotic resistance.  That is a bald faced lie perpetuated by a medical establishment increasingly indoctrinated to say what is politically useful to bad people rather than what is correct.</p>
<p>All you have to do is look at which nations use the most antibiotics (like Sweden) and notice that the incidence of antibiotic resistant strains is quite low there.</p>
<p>What causes antibiotic resistance is when someone infected with AIDS uses antibiotics, especially intermittently.  Usually, a bacteria or other susceptible pathogen that might mutate and develop such resistance will never survive out of the body to propagate.  Our immune system kills it.  If it gets a chance to spread to another, it&rsquo;s only one or two.  Realistically, this rarely happens as by the time a bacteria would have a chance to form such resistance, the infection is on its last legs and no longer communicable.</p>
<p>Except in the AIDS infected.</p>
<p>And indeed, the largest amounts of antibiotic resistant organisms are found wherever there are large numbers of AIDS infected.  Usually, they do not get to spread outside these non-white communities&hellip;.EXCEPT IN A HOSPITAL SETTING.</p>
<p>A STRONG argument for segregated hospitals.</p>
<p>Even then, there are ways to prevent this spread.  Antibiotic resistant does not mean it&rsquo;s not easily killed with modern day anti-septics.  Keeping to hospital grade hygiene will stop any organism like this dead.  Simple bleach will kill anything.  Almost always, such spreading of a disease like this happens in affirmative action hospitals&hellip;..where non-whites simply will not follow the hygiene procedures correctly.  Avoid these places.</p>

		<p>There should also be MAJOR penalties for those who dispense antibiotics like candy to idiots who don&rsquo;t know the consequences of failing to complete a series _exactly_ as they are instructed to do so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they are home grown or imported, in this day and age of &#8216;globalism&rsquo;, it should a matter of child&rsquo;s play to say: &#8220;You will gain control over your pharmacy industry, right now, or we will stop your oil/food/chemical/manufacturing imports like it was the Black Death all over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past these same globalists to be trying to curb the rise of independent, cheap, pharmaceuticals (and the medical trade that goes with) -on behalf of- the multi-trillion dollar big pharma groups.</p>
<p>It certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time that something has been pumped up as a disaster in the making for the purposes of securing profit.  Cruise Missiles in Africa anyone?</p>

		<p>The English is interesting, the red dots appear where there a high and I mean very high number of Indians and Pakistani immigrants. Surely not&hellip;.</p>
<p>Now draw a map of England and add red dots for terminal illnesses spread through ohhh lets say sexual contact and guess what ? youll find them concentrated in areas where theres a high number of African immigrants.</p>
<p>Strange that&hellip; Or maybe not</p>

<p>&#8220;Using antibiotics does not cause anti-biotic [sic] resistance. That is a bald faced lie perpetuated by a medical establishment increasingly indoctrinated to say what is politically useful to bad people rather than what is correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really?  Those Swedes you extol would disagree with you.</p>
<p><a href="/strama/SPAR__engelsk_version.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://soapimg.icecube.snowfall.se/strama/SPAR,_engelsk_version.pdf</a></p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;In Sweden, antibiotics are only used for medical purposes in human and veterinary medicine. In many other countries antibiotics are also used as growth promoters in animal husbandry and as plant protectors. When bacteria come into contact with antibiotics, only susceptible bacteria are inhibited, selecting out resistant varieties and<br>
giving them an advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All you have to do is look at which nations use the most antibiotics (like Sweden) and notice that the incidence of antibiotic resistant strains is quite low there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The above paragraph from the article shoots down both your argument that Sweden uses the most antibiotics (by their own admission, quite the opposite) and that antibiotic use doesn&rsquo;t eventually result in resistance among bacteria.  That is, of course, unless you want to accuse the Swedes of being liars and/or ignorant of the science of pathology.</p>
<p>Numerous studies from across the globe blame the haphazard use of antibiotics (in large part by Third Worlders) for the increase in resistant strains of bacteria.  Example: prostitutes in the Philippines for many years have been popping antibiotics like candy, resulting in penicillin-resistant strains of syphilis and gonorrhea.  That these strains are often associated with AIDS sufferers is due to the fact these patients are often battling infections and are therefore frequently dosed with antibiotics.</p>
<p>Someone needs to go back to school and relearn both evolutionary theory and the germ theory of disease.</p>
