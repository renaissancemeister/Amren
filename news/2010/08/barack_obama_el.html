<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first school in the D.C. area named after the current president opens Monday morning as the school year begins in Prince George&rsquo;s County.</p>
<p>Barack Obama Elementary School opens its doors in Upper Marlboro, Md., for the first time Monday. The school is being touted as being an environmentally friendly &#8220;green&#8221; school. There have been other schools named after President Obama in the country, but this will be a first in his own backyard in the D.C. region.</p>

		<p>The school was probably too expensive to build, its yearly maintenance costs and general education costs will be way too high, and we&rsquo;ll get very little in the way of results   &mdash;   Mark me, this will consistently be one of the worst schools in the state.  Therefore, it has the perfect name.</p>

		<p>PG (Purely Ghetto) County is a fitting place for this school as this area is a Black run ghetto full of illegitimate, welfare supported, unsupervised children and all the problems that go with it.  Hopefully the libtard&rsquo;s that run the People&rsquo;s Republic of Montgomery County won&rsquo;t feel compelled to do the same thing.  I imagine the next thing will be a President Obama Blvd., which would probably end up a danger zone just like all MLK Blvd&rsquo;s.  </p>

		<p>This article is further proof that Obama has a cult following much like Charles Manson and Jim Jones. The next step will be a religion in the messiah&rsquo;s name to honor and praise him.</p>

		<p>This makes it easy to know which schools not to send our children to.  You don&rsquo;t want to live on Malcom X Boulevard, and you don&rsquo;t want to send your children to Martin Luther King High or Barack Obama Elementary School.<br>

		<p>He received the Nobel Peace Prize for doing&hellip;what was it again? So why not just throw more honors his way? Being an incompetent president should pose no barrier to the mindless followers of his. Never have so many honored a person who has accomplished so little. So, when is George Washington&rsquo;s portrait on the one dollar bill going to be replaced with one of Obama?  </p>

		<p>Did he die? What happened to naming places and streets after people died as an HONOR!</p>
<p>If Obama wasn&rsquo;t a complete idiot, this sort of thing would make him very, very nervous.  Because you DO in fact name places after a person dies.  He is becoming, no, strike that, he long ago became much more useful as a martyr than an empty suit.  The left is getting antsy for him to move from the former role to the latter.</p>
<p>And those people are completely out of their minds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWMIwziGrAQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWMIwziGrAQ</a></p>
<p>That is what they would do, if they could, to millions of people only slightly inconvenient to their plans.  This is the type of people that are on the left&hellip;.murdering, genocidal freaks.</p>
<p>They would not hesitate for one second to do something nasty to Obama so he could be remembered for something other than the disaster his administration has been.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed something interesting with regard to Obama.  When he got the nomination and for some time afterward, there were all these crazy black men caught in various assassination plots.  Some guy caught armed to the teeth, in his house late at night.  Another with a sniper rifle headed to a speech he was going to give.  Some wack job using their own AIDS infected blood to write him a letter.</p>
<p>But for many months now, none of that.  I have a feeling that there are repeated incidents like this, so frequent and so bizarre that there is a media blackout on them.</p>

		<p>Always remember this; money isn&rsquo;t related to good education, DC schools have the highest per capita student expenditure in the nation.  Note: they also have the worst results, the lowest performing, the most drops, the absolute dregs of academia.</p>
<p>Go for it Barry S., the world will love you by law.  Not by results or merit.</p>

		<p>Naming things after people while they&rsquo;re still alive is not common, but there is precedent.</p>
<p>New Jersey&rsquo;s former governor, Brendan Byrne named a sports arena (the home of the NHL Devils and NBA Nets) the Brendan Byrne Arena in the 1980&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t know what its called now, but a Fortune 500 corporation subsequently paid millions of dollars to the Nets and Devils to rename the arena.</p>
<p>Denver, too, had a sports arena named after former mayor William McNichols, while he was still alive.</p>
