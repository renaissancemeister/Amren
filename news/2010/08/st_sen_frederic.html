<h1>St. Sen. Frederica Wilson Wants FCAT Law Repealed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WFOR-TV (Miami), August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Florida&rsquo;s Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT, has come under fire once again. This time from State Senator Frederica Wilson, who is running for Congress. Wilson, put on her anti-FCAT hat Tuesday at a news conference in front of the Miami-Dade County School Board building and blamed the test with creating more crime.</p>
<p>Sen. Wilson says she wants the FCAT law to be repealed because it&rsquo;s pushing Florida&rsquo;s children to a life of crime and destitution.</p>
<p>Surrounded by dozens of leaders from the African-American community and the Miami-Dade County school system, Wilson condemned the test. She echoed the cries of superintendents across the state and called the FCAT system flawed and also said the company that administers the test is responsible for a host of problems. FCAT scores came out six weeks late this year because of delays by the testing contractor hired by the state, NCS Pearson. NCS Pearson told the Florida Board of Education in June that it had computer problems which delayed getting the results out on time.</p>
<p>Sen. Wilson says she believes the FCAT is particularly affecting African-American children. She says all too many of them go to school, get a passing grade, yet cannot pass the FCAT and are kept out of the 9th grade. It&rsquo;s a situation that she says fosters a downward spiral for too many children.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they take drugs to numb their pain. And after they take drugs, they&rsquo;re in the fuzz, they don&rsquo;t even know where they are. They join a gang, they pick up an AK-47, they sell drugs, they turn to crime, they&rsquo;re jobless, they&rsquo;re fearless, and they&rsquo;re godless,&#8221; said Sen. Wilson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The FCAT is used to monitor students&rsquo; progress and schools&rsquo; compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind act. Third graders must pass the reading test to be advanced to fourth grade, while high school students must pass the 10th grade reading and math tests to receive a standard diploma.</p>

		<p>I love the hat and combined with this idiot speaking makes for a great laugh. I spent 7 years in an all black school and taught special ed. which means I read our states test over and over. 6X12 is still 6x12 no matter how you state the question. The test came about as a result of the high school simply passing anyone. To claim bias is the only thing that can explain it without her people taking blame. We all know they isn&rsquo;t so good at accepting blame for much of anything. So they waddle on &#8220;bias, slavery, racism&#8221; into oblivion. </p>
<p>I did love her idea of spending the money saved on testing to buy books. This lady should have gone to Harvard with Obama. Great thinking Fredrica. I can she she never tried to teach at an all black high school. Books we had a sea of but readers few.</p>

		<p>Same old chant: blacks and browns fail tests, so the tests <i>must</i> be Racist.  It&rsquo;s not the fault of blacks themselves.  It&rsquo;s <i>never</i> the fault of blacks themselves.  Somebody else   &mdash;   Whitey!   &mdash;   <i>must</i> be to blame!</p>
<p>Where, O where, have I heard this before?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;So they take drugs to numb their pain&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So <i>that&rsquo;s</i> why so many blacks do drugs.  Gosh, I always wondered about that.  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;And after they take drugs, they&rsquo;re in the fuzz, they don&rsquo;t even know where they are. They join a gang, they pick up an AK-47, they sell drugs, they turn to crime, they&rsquo;re jobless, they&rsquo;re fearless, and they&rsquo;re godless.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>I have no argument with that part, at least.  This is what passes for &#8220;career choice&#8221; in the ghet-to.   </p>
<p>Cry me a river, Frederica.<br>

		<p>Wow! The problem here is that the FCAT is only administered in Florida. If it was really a gateway to commiting rape, murder, theft, and drug use among Afro-Americans, what is the problem in the other forty-nine states?</p>

		<p>&#8220;State senator: Many blacks fail Florida&rsquo;s assessment test, become criminals and &ldquo;godless.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Many whites who don&rsquo;t do well on Florida&rsquo;s assessment test buckle up and learn enough to pass it easily a second time, as do many other non-blacks.</p>
<p>And if the still can&rsquo;t get a high enough score, they usually opt for one of the trades, which they usually excel in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised to read of someone who thinks blacks are so lowly and weak-minded they turn to crime at the first excuse to do so.</p>

		<p>Again an appeal to avoid responsibility by blacks.  This is the exact attitude of why the majority of blacks will never and have not made academic and economic progress no matter in what environment, country they are located, amount of money thrown at them.  Blacks always blaming an external cause instead of looking inner.  These arguments are similar to the ones used to excuse the actions of the black murderer in Connecticut.</p>

		<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t capable of thriving in a competetive Western society.  They just don&rsquo;t have the IQ to be able to compete.    Schools are under pressure to graduate blacks and the FCAT is the only roadblock to the grade inflation and social promotion that districts use to pass blacks along.  </p>

		<p>Very good article, it exemplifies the media&rsquo;s love affair with minorities whereby NOTHING is ever their fault.  You would think that if you fail a test in school you should be motivated to try harder next time and do your best. NO.  Just turn to a life of drugs, crime and violence and blame it on the system.</p>

<p>I consider that far more a problem with the grades than the test.  What the test is doing here is weeding out grade inflation and social promotion.</p>
<p>BTW, this test is only in Florida.  What explains black failure in the other states?  (Oops, NY has the Regents, so this pathetic bromide might seem to &#8220;fly&#8221; for NYS).</p>

		<p>It sounds more and more like we just need to go back to the old Jim Crow style of school systems.  In arguing for desegregation, blacks and their white liberal allies argued that white-run school districts allocated less to black schools than white, resulting in lower levels of education and academic excellence for blacks.  I think we should just give blacks the option of returning to this practice.  Taxes paid by blacks could go to black schools, and white to white.  We&rsquo;ll see how they like that.</p>

		<p>In her &#8220;heart of hearts&#8221; this State Senator must know that the reason the test is unfair is that, on average, blacks have about a 15 point lower I.Q. than whites. </p>
<p>In the state of New York, which I am more familiar with, there is a similar problem with results on the Regents exam, where blacks and Hispanics continue to have significantly poorer results than whites and Asians. The difference is here there is an obsession with new educational methodology coming out of Columbia University Teachers&rsquo; College to somehow solve the problem, and there are probably a much higher number of &#8220;true believers&#8221; in all the Education Departments of major colleges and universities to keep this illusion going for at least a while longer. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, they GET a passing grade, they don&rsquo;t EARN a passing grade. That&rsquo;s WHY they fail the FCAT. I mean, how other way is it possible to receive a passing grade yet fail the FCAT?</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #1: The hat is great. If you&rsquo;re looking to advance a serious discussion on educational policy there&rsquo;s nothing like a cheap, shiny red Stetson knock-off to lend credibility to your argument. </p>
<p>This woman is the definition of a moron. To think she might wind up in Congress is frightening. </p>
<p>From the article:<br>
&#8220;Sen. Wilson says she wants the FCAT law to be repealed because it&rsquo;s pushing Florida&rsquo;s children to a life of crime and destitution.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the dumbest things I&rsquo;ve ever read - and if you&rsquo;ve been on AmRen for any length of time - you&rsquo;ve read some dumb things coming from nitwits like Sen. Wilson.</p>
<p>I wonder if she can point us to the many studies which show that that an 8th grade skills assessment test leads to a life of crime. </p>
<p>This is also from the article:<br>
&#8220;Surrounded by dozens of leaders from the African-American community and the Miami-Dade County school system, Wilson condemned the test.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a surprise. Also, how many leaders does a community need? With dozens of leaders you&rsquo;d think the black &#8220;community&#8221; would have it together by now. </p>
<p>The idea behind the standardized test is to eliminate the bias of grade inflation which allows low IQ blacks from being pushed along in school by teachers under pressure to pass minority students.</p>
<p>It is glaringly obvious - and statistically confirmed across the US - that most blacks cannot function academically at a level even close to whites. That&rsquo;s why they fail the test.</p>
<p>Instead of eliminating the test why not focus on restructuring the curriculum and allow blacks (and other low IQ/academically deficient students) to proceed at their own level, teaching them skills (both practical AND moral) which will prepare them for a future, for a job, they are capable of performing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said it here before and I will say it again:  these students should have to pass a TWELFTH grade reading and math test to get a high school diploma.  Knowing tenth grade reading and math does not mean you have a high school education.  Imagine what blacks and hispanics would say if we actually had STANDARDS.  Imagine if you actually were required to do twelfth grade math and twelfth grade English.  Could you even imagine?  I mean, what would happen if you had to show that you got a high school education in order to get a high school diploma?  </p>
<p>No one is being discriminated against - they&rsquo;re all just being coddled.  It&rsquo;s pathetic.  </p>

		<p>Well, this buffoon Wilson&rsquo;s right - it&rsquo;s not they&rsquo;re fault.  They were born STUPID!  Nothing can change that, though application and hard work would help maximize their low intelligence and give them a fighting chance of making a productive life for themselves.</p>
<p>Dumbing down the test changes nothing. It merely means that more dumb people can pass it.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s past time to declare public education a failure, repeal all compulsory-attendance laws, take advantage of the new digital age, and start over. Gary North recently wrote an excellent article on the subject <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north874.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Think of the time and money saved to educate kids willing and able to learn. Then think of the time and money <i>not</i> wasted on trying to educate apathetic, unteachable blacks.</p>

		<p>low cognitive ability is by far the most serious problem facing blacks as a group, and the solution is appropriate training and jobs with adequate social support. </p>
<p>If blacks with IQs below ca 70 would stop reproducing, that would help as well, but ultimately, this is a less intellectually endowed demographic, and neither ridicule nor education reform is helpful. </p>
<p>we should emphasize basic edu &amp; job training (practical skills, NOT academics!!) &amp; end all 3rd world immigration for 25 years to allow blacks access to the jobs hispanics have taken from them.  </p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to love blacks, but they are Americans &amp; they are our collective problem forever, so let&rsquo;s be constructive.</p>

		<p>I grew up in Florida. I saw firsthand the dull, almost vacant morality and sloth that so many Floridian blacks displayed. Until the chance came to beat someone down (in a pack, as always). Then it was flailing madly, full of energy.</p>
<p>Not every black, of course, but a very large lot of them. </p>
<p>Some would scream I&rsquo;m a racist. No, I have seen, I have lived. Truth hurts. These are just plain faced observations, made over decades. And I never once saw a black take a fair fight, one on one. I never saw a black make good on a promise to &#8220;get me&#8221;, when I said &#8220;bring it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember getting punched in the face by a mumbling black kid for no reason at all&hellip;his pack hung about waiting for me not to fight back. I reflexively punched the black right back. He looked at me blankly, stunned as I was. I turned and walked away. I wonder if they set upon him to get their blood lust fulfilled, since, cowards as they were, they didn&rsquo;t get to kick my body on the floor.</p>
<p>Oh, tests? Whatever. Talk about fiddling while Rome burns.</p>

For those who lack the intelligence to learn, the self discipline to perform unskilled jobs conscientiously, and who are inherently vicious, this will happen eventually.  <br>
 <br>
Rather than waste tax payers&rsquo; money money trying to turn these thugs into scholars, we should turn them into prisoners, and make them work fourteen hours a day, six days a week at hard labor, while enforcing discipline with a whip.  That is the only way we can get any value out of them.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;The FCAT is used to monitor students&rsquo; progress and schools&rsquo; compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind act. Third graders must pass the reading test to be advanced to fourth grade, while high school students must pass the 10th grade reading and math tests to receive a standard diploma.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
No Child Left Behind was designed to bridge the gap in average academic performance between blacks and whites.  Unfortunately, it is accumulating evidence that the gap is unbridgeable. <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, administrators of the program, journalists, and others continue to announce evidence of &#8220;progress,&#8221; however misleading, with the accompaniment of trumpets and drums.  <br>
 <br>
This reminds me of the War on Poverty.  When it was obvious that the War on Poverty had done little but nurture an underclass of welfare recipients who supplemented their welfare checks with the gains of crime, Ronald Reagan was able to say, &#8220;We had a war on poverty   &mdash;   poverty won.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
When it is obvious that No Child Left Behind has been an expensive failure, Republicans will not be able to blame Democrats.  Republicans and Democrats are equally complicit.   </p>

		<p>I teach in NY and yes we have those Regents tests that Asians do so well on and blacks do so miserable on.  The difference is that the Asians study like robots due to parental pressure, and the blacks blow it off due to no parental involvement.</p>
<p>My school right now is all latino students, and so many have failed the various regents that our 12th grade is bulging with &#8216;super seniors&rsquo; that we are trying to get out of the school into GED programs.  Many are at or near 21 years old, so we are &#8216;ageing&rsquo; them out.</p>
<p>Many who have &#8216;passed&rsquo; the tests did so because they got lucky with dumbed down editions of the test coupled with kind-hearted graders.  The typical &#8216;passing&rsquo; score on a regents test is 65% and this means they got a whopping 33% of the questions right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a shell game, my friends, and our country and way of life are toast.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got it right on.  Bullseye.</p>
<p>Blacks&hellip;.but especially the liberal white loons&hellip;&hellip;.have had tremendous luck in getting blacks in everywhere a test isn&rsquo;t required.  Universities allow them in even though they&rsquo;re unqualifid, then they pressure professors to give them passing grades.  It is SOP that X number of blacks MUST be given a certification that amounts to completing work at the eighth grade level or the instructor will have to answer for it.</p>
<p>Does anybody really believe that Michelle Obama would have been given passing grades if she were white?  </p>
<p>Corporations MUST hire blacks, even though they are aware they can&rsquo;t do an adequate job or Jesse Jackson et al will boycott their product or services.  None of this would be possible if minimum testing requirements are given beforehand.  If they were, they would have to go to the courts to get a corrupt judge like Sotomayor to render a crooked decision, which she has done on numerous occassions, since she despises white people.</p>
<p>The leftist radicals behind this naively think that the introduction of large numbers of unqualified blacks over a long period of time will automatically lower expectations and standards to accommodate future blacks.  </p>
<p>Like everything about leftist ideology it is childish and illogical and based in fantasy, not reality.  </p>
<p>When the corporate layoffs accelerate, the least competent, least necessary individuals will be axed.  And, of course, that means blacks.  Universities will have far few dollars to waste, and many will close.</p>

		<p>Like what? No white kid ever failed? The problem with all of these standardized tests is that they are primarily created to provide some company in Riverside, New Jersey with profit. They are no longer basic skills tests which is what they should, if anything, be. Actually, a good teacher knows where each kid in the class is without the benefit of these tests. A professor at Boston College has studied the results of the Texas Standardized Test throughout it&rsquo;s life-span (TABS, TEAMS, TAAS, TEKS) and noticed that Texas began bragging about the lowering of its drop-out rate. What he found was that the dropout rate only dropped in secondary schools because the rate had increased in junior and middle schools. Granted, teachers may not be doing the best job in the world; but standardized tests have taken all the joy and fun out of teaching and learning. As an educator for 37 years, I can attest to the fact that kids learn more from teachers they love and material that may or may not be &#8220;on the test&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Passing or failing this test has little to do with the fact that they turn to a life of crime. They were destined to a life of crime all along. It&rsquo;s in their genes, or maybe their jeans depending on what types of crimes we are talking about. They surely believe to pass the test is equal to hitting the ghetto lottery. When in truth failing might be better, since no telling what the multicult elites will reward them with due to raaaciss white discrimination. If you are a little slow you must put forth more effort to achieve equality, or you can simply deal drugs, steal, and play the race card for your success.</p>

<p>Sigh.  Every few years there is yet another billion (probably trillion by now) dollar &#8216;program&rsquo; from the lefties at Columbia.  I&rsquo;ve been through most of them-Authentic Pedagogy &amp; Assessment, Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy, Brain-Based Teaching &amp; Learning, Critical Thinking, Inquiry-Based Teaching, Multiple Intelligences, Outcome-Based Education,Phonics vs. Whole Language  &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s just a few, there are many more.</p>
<p>What do they have in common?  FAILURE.  Let me repeat that:  FAILURE.  Got it?</p>
<p>Every<br>
Last<br>
One<br>
of<br>
Them.</p>
<p>And the lefties at Columbia well know this; I&rsquo;m convinced they are well aware of racial IQ  differences in IQ and behavior.  If you dig a little deeper, I&rsquo;m positive you&rsquo;d find those hypocritical lefties at Columbia send their precious children to majority White (or ethnic-based) schools and live in majority White neighborhoods  &mdash;  just like White-hating Rev.Wright.</p>
<p>They have their jobs to protect after all, PC textbooks to publish, speeches to give, theories to pontificate about.  They know what happens when they deviate from the PC party line  &mdash;  ostracism, scorn and ridicule, publishers won&rsquo;t touch them, speaking engagements dry up, no medals, awards or accolades, attacks in the media, possible physical attacks.</p>
<p> Just ask Jensen, MacDonald, Lynn, Watson and Rushton.</p>
<p>But&hellip;.instead of being laughed at and ridiculed, as these programs should be, and the achievement gap squarely, definitively and once and for all put on easily proved racial IQ differences, the pointy-headed elitists at Columbia will once again re-group and come up with yet another stupid theory (and trillion-dollar program) as to why blacks and hispanics score lower than Whites.  You see, it&rsquo;s highly lucrative for them  &mdash;  and even better if they can bash Whites at the same time.</p>
<p>And, you are indeed correct:  There is always another crop of young idiots, some Teach for America types, steeped in educational PC (and yes, I was one once) who REALLY TRULY believe they personally can &#8216;close the achievement gap&rsquo; because it can never be the kid&rsquo;s fault if he is a failure, it MUST be the teacher, teaching method or (as always) a racist, sexist, oppressive society that strives to keep down &#8216;people of color.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Most of the PC brainwashing wears off by Christmas, which is usually when the last Teach for America types depart and don&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<p>And:  #1 Southern writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The test came about as a result of the high school simply passing anyone&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is very true.  But there is a good reason behind this.</p>
<p>In my district (and two others I&rsquo;ve worked for) if the administration notices that YOU (especially if you are White) are failing too many of your &#8216;disadvantaged&rsquo; students, you will be called on the carpet in front of the principal and made to explain why YOU, personally, are failing so many of your students. </p>
<p>Expect to be blamed for not teaching correctly, not understanding the learning methods of &#8216;children of color&rsquo;  &mdash;  you may be ordered into even more &#8216;professional developments&rsquo; as happened to a math teacher I work with.  In other words, you will be blamed for the failures of your students  &mdash;  never mind that the average black/hispanic kid in your room reads at a 3rd grade level (in the 10th-11th grade), computes at a 1st grade level and has received scores in the bottom 2% on the state tests for the past seven or eight years.  None of that matters.</p>
<p>This is why a lot of teachers pass the kids on; it&rsquo;s simply less of a hassle for us in what we know is an impossible, intractable situation  &mdash;   and most of us are cogs just trying to get through the day, do the best we can and collect our paychecks</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s sub saharan ethnic constituents have an average IQ of around 85. Even more of a problem, is that their bell curve is more narrow, and 5/6s of them inherit an IQ of less than 100. </p>
<p>However some mulattoes and octaroons even are able to score over 115 on an IQ test. </p>
<p>The coloreds are extremely sensitive about their innate stupidity, and try to deflect away by blaming normal white people.</p>
<p>This can be a problem, because they feel put upon and these feelings can lead to them gunning normal white people down for these perceived slights of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>So true. That&rsquo;s how it is in the schools. Let me take it from there into the workplace.   Having had a large, overwhelmingly black, staff to manage, I can say that it is much the same on the job.  At evaluation time, managers have been told by Mr. Big that &#8220;There will be no failing evaluations!&#8221;   This presents an impossible dilemma when, in fact, half of the staff are tuly &#8220;Below Standards&#8221;, but you are not allowed to say it. (Especially of they&rsquo;re black or non-white.) The only alternative you have is to bite your tongue and lie. </p>
<p>Upper management (like school principals) don&rsquo;t want these problems. They don&rsquo;t want evaluation appeals, union cases, EEO complaints, allegations of discrimination (which are an automatic death knell for management, whether true or not). They don&rsquo;t want the NAACP or politicians getting interested. They don&rsquo;t want the Human Rights Commission snooping around and doing investigations.  So they seek the easy way by not rocking the boat, because this would affect THEIR OWN jobs. Therefore, if you are honest and objective and go by the book (as you should), you will be seen as causing trouble. Higher management doesn&rsquo;t want that, and YOU are the one who will suffer. </p>
<p>I remember a fellow manager (my own superior) who once remarked to the Big Shot (then a Puerto Rican) that one of the young women (a pretty girl, also Puerto Rican) was not performing up to par.  He told me that he never saw Biggie get so angry!  He was informed bluntly  that if she was not performing satisfactorily, then that was HIS FAULT, and  that it was his job to see to it that she was brought up to par. He learned his lesson and never criticized her again!  Ethnic solidarity prevalied over objectivity.   </p>
<p>Thus, as in the schools, it is not the fault of those people who are under-performing, it is YOUR fault if they are under-performing. You learn to keep your opinions to yourself and give everyone good evaluations. So what if they call in sick every Monday?  So what if they take 2-hour lunches and sneak out early every Friday?  You look the other way and see nothing. </p>
<p>But if further complications develop later on   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s say someone is arrested for some crime [it happened occasionally]    &mdash;   then you will be called on the carpet and asked why you gave that person a good evaluation.  You can&rsquo;t win!  Or if at some point in the furure it becomes necessary to fire that person, your good evaluation will stand in the way.  Nor can you ever recommend disciplinary procedures  (in the future) because you will be accused of hypocrisy or double-talk since you had formerly spoken well of that otherwise useless employee. And now you&rsquo;re recommending dismissal?  But you already said that employee was an asset!  It will make you look confused and stupid.</p>
<p>As Bon said, you learn to just get through the day and collect your paycheck. And the bottom line for all of this is the fact of our society&rsquo;s worship of Diversity  [you know, it&rsquo;s supposed to make us stronger]  and the  ever-looming possibility of discrimination charges. With a non-diverse workforce, it would be possible to be much more honest and objective. There wouldn&rsquo;t be the constant, if unspoken, threat of &#8220;racism&#8221;&hellip; which, as we see now, is lately becoming an acceptable excuse even for mass murder.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this happen a number of times with extremely sub-par non-White teachers.  White principals are deathly afraid to criticize obviously incompetent non-Whites, some of whom are an hour late every day, nowhere to be found during class time, do not keep a register or attendance or attend mandated professional developments (things for which I could be fired, transferred to an all-black school or written up as a trouble-maker), or have been caught in thefts of school property.  All receive glowing evaluations.</p>
<p>White principals know that they will be axiomatically accused of racism and forced to face the black teachers&rsquo; union, the EEOC, the uber-bosses in the district office who will make his life hell, the NAACP and a pro-bono lawyer hungry for a large settlement.  It is a no-win situation and every White administrator I&rsquo;ve worked with, including DH (dear husband), knows it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of David Horowitz&rsquo;s autobiography, Radical Son.  Years after his radical days Horowitz asked the Oakland Head of Homicide (now retired) whom he had befriended, why the police never arrested and prosecuted black criminal/celebrity/media darling Huey Newton when they had so much evidence against him all the way up to and including murder?  The retired officer told Horowitz that every time the police came near Newton, radical lawyers like William Kunstler and the media would be right there screaming police brutality.</p>
<p>Horowitz writes that he finally realized that cops are ordinary humans with jobs to protect, working stiffs with families, mortgages that needed to be paid, trying to get through another day alive, coping with a system that is stacked against them, striving to tough it out without making waves or drawing attention to themselves until they could escape the insanity, retire and start drawing their pensions.</p>
<p>A lot of us White teachers are in the same situation.</p>

		<p>All readers of Amren who are interested in issues related to education need to read what Bon (Posts 27 and 32) writes.  I am in exactly the same situation and see the same things DAILY.</p>
<p>I write about what I see in these public &#8216;skews&rsquo; quite often, as does Bon.  We are in different cities yet the experience is the same.  It&rsquo;s all over the nation.</p>
<p>Most blacks in high school are truly at 2nd to 3rd grade level in all subjects and many are below that.</p>
<p>Most Latinos have insurmountable language issues due to lack of assimilation, and many are no better than grade 4-5 in their abilities while they are in high school.</p>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s unions are not to blame for this mess.  How do you teach an eleventh grader who reads at a 2nd grade level, and who doesn&rsquo;t want to &#8216;do no work&rsquo; because he&rsquo;s a gangbanger or she&rsquo;s preggers?</p>
<p>The Teacher&rsquo;s unions put a good face on it and go along with the &#8216;accountability&rsquo; movement only to stay in the loop, but most teachers on the ground know the score and stay tight lipped and pass Diego and Shaquanda along to protect their job from the blame teachers zealots.</p>
<p>White kids who get caught up in rapidly blacking and browning schools get sucked into the mess and further degrade our community.</p>
<p>The end is near.</p>

These are excellent comments but, even so, let me say that I do NOT like the last paragraph of Jay&rsquo;s otherwise good post. Writing &#8220;The end is near&#8221; is not a wholesome approach to take. Pessimism like that is not going to resolve anything or get us anywhere! Sorry, I am not a quitter.  I do not believe in lying down and giving up. There has to be a better way.</p>
