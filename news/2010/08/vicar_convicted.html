			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick Barkham and Caroline Davies, Guardian (London), July 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A vicar has been convicted of conducting hundreds of fake marriage ceremonies at his East Sussex church to enable illegal African immigrants to gain residency in Britain.</p>
<p>The Rev Alex Brown, 61, presided over 360 sham marriages where penniless East Europeans, with rights to live and work in the UK, were paid up to Â£3,000 each to wed Africans, mainly from Nigeria, at the church of St Peter and St Paul in St Leonards-on-Sea.</p>
<p>He was found guilty of conspiring to facilitate the commission of breaches of immigration laws with co-defendant, Ukrainian national Vladymyr Buchak, at Lewes crown court after a seven-week trial during which he maintained he had simply been naive. Nigerian-born Michael Adelasoye, 50, a solicitor who specialised in immigration law and advised African participants on residency applications once married, was also convicted.</p>
<p>The court had heard that Buchak, 33, living illegally in the UK since at least 2004, preyed on migrant East Europeans living in the area, who were desperate to earn money, by offering them large cash sums to wed Africans who wanted to obtain residency documents.</p>
<p>Brown, from Alnwick, Northumberland, described by parishioners as a man with a social conscience and a pillar of the local community, would then marry the couples.</p>
<p>In the four years to 2005, he married just 13 couples. But between July 2005 and July 2009 the number of ceremonies leapt 30-fold.</p>
<p>Jurors were told the ceremonies involved couples who produced rings that did not fit, couples who could not speak the same language, and several people who would request to marry one person one week and the next week decide to marry someone else.</p>
<p>It was also apparent that, of the hundreds of people who married, all seemed to live in the streets surroundingthe parish church, with 90 couples registered as living in one road alone.</p>
<p>In some instances there were several brides and grooms claiming to live in the same house and jurors were told that most of those involved in the marriages had given false addresses.</p>
<p>Two years after the surge in ceremonies Brown was summoned to meet the Archdeacon of Hastings and Lewes, Philip Jones, and questioned about them. He stopped for a short period. Then, apparently satisfied, the Church of England hierarchy allowed him to continue the weddings, which bolstered the ailing finances at his church.</p>
<p>Brown was arrested on 30 June last year after a joint investigation by Sussex police and the UK Border Agency, and his vicarage and the church were searched.</p>
<p>There they found documents he had doctored, including the church&rsquo;s electoral roll, to hide the increase in weddings over which he was presiding.</p>
<p>Buchak was arrested the same day and identity documents belonging to some East Europeans involved found in his home in St Leonards, while many of their numbers were found on his mobile phone.</p>
<p>He declined to give evidence in the trial, while Brown and the third defendant, Adelasoye both denied knowing the marriages were false when they each took to the witness box.</p>
<p>Although Buchak was seen as the principal organiser of the operation, prosecutor David Walbank said Brown must have been fully aware that the majority of the weddings he was conducting at the church were sham.</p>
<p>Giving evidence, Brown said he only ever married couples he was sure were getting married for the right reasons and exceptions would be made only if the bride-to-be was imminently expected to give birth. But he admitted he occasionally forgot to check the passports of foreign nationals wanting to get married to make sure they had indefinite leave to remain in the UK.</p>
<p>Outside court, the Archdeacon of Lewes and Hastings said Brown had committed a &#8220;betrayal of trust&#8221; towards his congregation and the wider community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are particularly sorry for those who have been deceived and hurt by the actions of Father Alex Brown,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Brown, who was suspended from his duties after his arrest, may now face disciplinary action from the Church.</p>
<p>Sentencing was adjourned to a later date.<br>

		<p>Let me be blunt.  This story, juxtaposed with the story of the nuns downplaying the immigration angle of the death of a sister  at the hands of an illegal immigrant, leads me to one conclusion:  The number one enemy of sensible immigrantion restriction is Christianity. </p>

<p>Maybe not Christianity itself, but the modern practitioners, who are globalizationists in bed with Marxists.</p>
<p>Christian leaders no longer care about white values or people.  Christianity came to Europe from the Middle East and displaced native European religion. Christianity is a foreign faith, which advocates and practices racial promiscuity with all races.</p>
<p>If whites would divorce Christianity and return to exclusively European forms of faith, we would be free of Christianity&rsquo;s suicidal marriage with the non-white world. </p>

<p>The Archdeacon should be charged as well, or at least suspended by the church, for failing to supervise properly. Now, he&rsquo;s trying to distance himself from this mess in order to cover his own hide. But he was already aware of the misbehavior and failed to follow through and stop it.</p>

		<p>Seek, this also fits well with my years long episodic postings on Amren attempting to point out all the problems Christianity poses for white survival.  Aside from the blatant psychological blackmail of it, Christianity&rsquo;s aim is to convert the world and always has been.  Race and nationality is ignored by scripture in the NT.  It requires complete hypocrisy to assert racial, ethnic, or national concerns in Christianity, even though it has been done throughout it&rsquo;s history.  This doesn&rsquo;t make it valid, it just illustrates the size of the virus in Western thought, that has always led to rebellion and civil wars where whites destroy other whites.  Those who pedal Christianity have alwlays been far more concerned with earthly possessions and power than anything else.  What whites need is a new WHITE WAR GOD.</p>

<p>It sure has played an enormous role in our 3rd world immigration. Especially the Catholic and Lutheran Churches. More churches are jumping on board though. Christianity has been dumbed down to the point of no return IMO. Missionaries also play a big role in bringing in those they &#8220;mission&#8221; to in these 3rd world nations. IMO, these &#8220;Christians&#8221; will be the death of the White race, and I am a Christian but I most certainly do not believe the hogwash they put out.</p>

		<p>I see there is no mention of annulling these &#8220;marriages&#8221; or their presumed &#8220;entitlement&#8221; to UK citizenship gained by fraud.  This is just one small parish - how many more must be doing the same scam? This may be the tip of an enormous  iceberg.</p>

		<p>This is the Anglican church? The church of ENGLAND?</p>
<p>They probably have deep pockets. If any of these persons engaging in the sham marriages commits a crime and it caught, the victims should sue the CHURCH for having established a climate that led to the crime. The perp would not have been there in the first place if not for the connivance of the &#8220;man of GOD&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you are from England and read this, pass it on to one and all. Please do so.</p>

		<p>This story brings to mind the saying, &#8216;build a wall, deport them all&rsquo; except that in England they don&rsquo;t even have to build a wall. They are surrounded by ocean and they still can&rsquo;t keep them out. </p>

<p>Social conscience? LOL!</p>
<p><i>Then, apparently satisfied, the Church of England hierarchy allowed him to continue the weddings, which bolstered the ailing finances at his church.</i></p>
<p>So the hierarchy was more interested in those 20 pieces of silver eh? I agree with #4. The Archdeacon should be tried as well. I would also add that the Church should have to surrender all the money it collected on those sham weddings. And recompense the taxpayers for all the welfare those illegals scarfed up while living there. What&rsquo;s more, the assets of those east europeans who took part should be siezed and then they should be DEPORTED. All those who took part should have to pay the price.</p>

		<p>@ Seek #1: Don&rsquo;t confuse &#8220;Liberation Theology&#8221;, that has been with us since the Communists sent their Agents into the Seminaries in the 1960s, which gave us Pedophiles, and Marxist nonsense, instead of the true teachings of the Gospels.</p>
<p>For traditional Catholicism, try the website for Tradition, Family and Property, or TFP.com, which champions the true Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church most of us still belong to.</p>

<p>Do you know if these were actual Eastern Europeans or were they cigany, gypsies? The newspapers in the U.K. are mad for calling gypsies &#8220;Eastern Europeans&#8221; so as to make the uninformed reader think of White Slavs cooking up Haluski and Peirogi and not dark gypsies. I know that there are gypsies all over Europe but it seems to me that most come from the countries you mentioned- Romania, Poland and Bulgaria. <br>
I would be surprised if these were true, White Germanic and Slavic Eastern Europeans marrying black Nigerians. I&rsquo;m sure &#8220;THEY&#8221; want us to think that but those of us who know better see right through this ruse of calling gypsies &#8220;Eastern Europeans&#8221;. When an English newspaper says &#8220;Eastern European&#8221; you can be 99% sure that they are talking about gypsies.</p>

		<p>If you can get get a racially aware White Anglo-American minister with 1000 parishoners to convert to Eastern Orthodoxy, you can petition the Patriarch of Constantinople for an ETHNIC church for White Americans with pre-Civil War ancestry, just as other Orthodox nations have. Non-Americans could join but won&rsquo;t be able to relate to all sermons. It&rsquo;s legal. Christianity ain&rsquo;t the problem, just Protestantism &amp; Catholicism, hence Orthodox Russians, Georgians, Armenians &amp; Serbs are huge nationalists</p>

		<p>highduke #17, I&rsquo;m not a Christian myself and believe that Christians should decide for themselves which denomination to belong to.  But still, if you want organized Christianity without the liberation theology gunk, Eastern Orthodox looks like the way to go.<br>
