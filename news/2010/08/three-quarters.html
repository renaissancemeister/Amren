<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/02/poll-islam-negative-britain">Three-Quarters of Non-Muslims Believe Islam Negative for Britain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Haroon Siddique, Guardian (London), August 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three-quarters of non-Muslims believe Islam has provided a negative contribution to British society, according to a new poll, which has prompted calls for Muslims to help improve the perception of their faith.</p>
<p>The study for the Islamic Education and Research Academy (iERA) also found that 63% of people surveyed did not disagree with the statement &#8220;Muslims are terrorists&#8221; and 94% agreed that &#8220;Islam oppresses women&#8221;. It included qualitative as well as quantitative data. One respondent said: &#8220;If I had my way I&rsquo;d kick them all [Muslims] out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results follow an online YouGov poll, published in June, that found 58% linked Islam with extremism and 69% believed it encouraged the repression of women.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread negative perceptions of Islam, iERA believes the fact that most opinions were formed in ignorance of the faith indicates that Muslims can positively influence them.</p>
<p>Four-fifths of those polled said they have less than very little knowledge about Islam, while 40% did not know who &#8220;Allah&#8221; referred to and 36% did not know who the Prophet Muhammad was.</p>
<p>iERA&rsquo;s senior researcher Hamza Tzortzis said: &#8220;We wanted to do something positive with the survey results rather than just say, &#8216;It&rsquo;s so sad&rsquo;. So, the organisation&rsquo;s strategy is to give a new realm of possibility for people to comprehend Islam, have a proper respect for Islam and see the human relevance of the faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organisation has made a number of recommendations on how to spread knowledge of Islam and the Muslim community through education and audiovisual materials. It also advocates &#8220;promoting Muslim women as ambassadors of change&#8221; to counter the impression that they are oppressed.</p>
<p>Although the survey indicated people may not be willing to listen  &mdash;  60% said they preferred not to receive any information about religion, while 77% did not agree in any way that Muslims should do more to teach people about their faith  &mdash;  Tzortzis believes they will if they are shown that religion is relevant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to show that it [Islam] encompasses all the things in your life whether social or practical,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had one of the biggest economic crises and we had no Islamic scholar saying the Islamic [financial] model wasn&rsquo;t as affected and might be relevant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study, carried out for iERA out by DJS Research, used face-to face questionnaires to ascertain the views of a &#8220;statistically robust&#8221; sample of 500 randomly selected non-Muslims.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Three-quarters of non-Muslims believe Islam has provided a negative contribution to British society&#8221;.  This would be the 75%of the population which actually comes into contact with Islam on a regular basis.  The other 25% are the bought and paid for politicians and traitorous business hierarchy who care little for the average person and who, by their policy and actions, show they actually despise Britain. </p>

		<p>SO 3/4 on non muslims in Englandistan huh? I suspect that by now, 3/4 of NON MUSLIMS is only about 1/20th of the overall population of England now, England and France are lost&hellip;been there, and it is now to late to try to get them (black muslims) out without MASSIVE fire bombings and the usual stuff muslims and blacks do, and in those countries, black and muslim is the same thing.</p>

<p>But the elites don&rsquo;t care what the people think, because they&rsquo;re going to foist anything they want on the public, because they believe they are so far superior to the common man only they can decide what is best for their fellow citizens.</p>
<p>After the smoke settles from this ongoing economic catastrophe, I&rsquo;d love to see their faces when they get a knock on the door from a committee of correspondence, demanding that they give an account of their actions and why they forced the public to accept what they never, ever wanted.</p>

		<p>Hopefully this survey will open the eyes of the British leadership.</p>
<p>No doubt this survey will be carefully analyzed and then followed by an all out state of the art public relations blitz secretly funded by Saudi Arabia.  Be on the look out for intelligent, attractive, smiling Moslem women everywhere.</p>

		<p>My interpretation is that the UK is 25% Islamic then.  Having lived there I see no hope anymore to stop the decent into horror.  As someone posted here we need to screen white refugees very carefully and treat them all like potential war criminals do be very sure they were not contributing to the collapse of this once great nation.</p>

<p>Improve the perception? It sounds like they already have a very accurate perception of what Islam is. What they want to do is manipulate the discussion with propaganda.</p>

		<p>Obviously, this 75% still isn&rsquo;t voting BNP at the polls. Until they do, they may as well sit back and enjoy more of the &#8220;negativity&#8221; that Islam brings, because they&rsquo;re sure not doing a thing to stop it.</p>

		<p>Well, if this is true, then The Brits (white, real Brits) have a chance to catapult the invaders back home. They are more majority white than the USA.<br>
Too Bad Britain was morally gutted by the end of WWII.<br>

Islam is only 1400 years old and is one of the worlds youngest religions.<br>
Let us make that a fact.<br>
It is considered to be a death cult because in the passages of its holy book, the Quran, major issues of life that are part of Islam are inaccurately translated in order to lure converts.<br>
Those passages are also contain its major ethical errors legalizing perjury, murder, and deceit, to spread its occult religion.<br>
Muslims who over the last two decades immigrated to Britian have re-packaged their death cult religion in political correctness since they could no longer conquer Britain by the sword.<br>
In Britian, too much emphasis is placed upon politically correct discussion and debate about Islam to appease parliaments policies of socialist totalitarianism and the publics fear of racial reality.<br>
Once the people of Britian lift the veil of their kaleidoscopic multicultural perceptions, they will begin to heal and in doing so save the final remnants of the white world.<br>

		<p>That means that three quarters of British non-Muslims could go to jail for hate crimes were they to make their opinions publicly known.  Yet most of them will still never consider voting for the BNP.<br>

		<p>I am sure that had a survey been taken during the 1939-45 war that most Britons would have had a similarly negative attitude about Nazism. They would not have needed a detailed understanding of Nazi ideology to be entitled, based upon experience, to believe that it had a &#8220;negative&#8221; effect for the British people.</p>
<p>The fact is that people have eyes in their heads. They can see the terrorist attacks, read about the hate speeches, see the women in burquas and bearded men dressed in filthy rags on their streets.</p>
<p>How will knowledge of the Koran improve that? Will knowledge of Mohamed the epileptic, paedophile, drug addled murderer improve that opinion?</p>
<p>Will knowledge of Jihad, dhimmitude, ethnic cleansing, slavery, halal slaughter, genital mutilation and the white slave trade make us accept them? </p>

<p>He was so right.</p>
