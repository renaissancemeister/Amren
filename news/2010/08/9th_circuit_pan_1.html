<h1>9th Circuit Panel Strikes Down Rape Conviction, Citing Race Bias</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Denny Walsh, Sacramento Bee, July 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal appeals court has struck down a conviction and life sentence of an African American man for a heinous rape eight years ago in Sacramento County, ruling that the prosecutor had no lawful reason to dismiss two African Americans from the jury pool.</p>
<p>Steven Frank Jackson was found guilty by a Superior Court jury of breaking into a 72-year-old white woman&rsquo;s apartment and repeatedly raping her and sexually assaulting her in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Saliva found on her breast yielded a positive match of Jackson&rsquo;s DNA, and the victim identified Jackson at the trial as her attacker in the early hours of April 29, 2002.</p>
<p>The jury pronounced him guilty of a multitude of sexual crimes and one count of burglary, and on Sept. 30, 2004, at age 39, Jackson was sentenced to a &#8220;three-strikes&#8221; prison term of 310 years to life. The verdict and sentence were affirmed by a state appellate court and the federal district court in Sacramento. The California Supreme Court declined review.</p>
<p>But both were overturned last week by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The Sacramento County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office will ask the state attorney general&rsquo;s office, which handles criminal appeals from state trial courts, to seek review by an enlarged circuit panel.</p>
<p>If that request is denied, or if a larger panel affirms the three judges&rsquo; ruling, it will be up to District Attorney Jan Scully whether to retry Jackson. Absent a retrial, he will go free.</p>
<p>In a 2 1/2-page memorandum the three judges state that the reasons the prosecutor gave for his peremptory challenges excusing the two prospective African American jurors &#8220;were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purposeful discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 9th Circuit judges note with some indignation that &#8220;two out of three prospective African American jurors were stricken,&#8221; and then declare that &#8220;the record reflected different treatment of comparably situated jurors.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision took us completely by surprise,&#8221; said Sacramento County Chief Deputy District Attorney Cindy Besemer. She said Deputy District Attorney Scott Triplett had &#8220;excused two jurors for reasons other than race. The 9th Circuit&rsquo;s order doesn&rsquo;t cite any evidence which conflicts with the findings made by (two) lower courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Responding to the trial judge&rsquo;s request for his reasons, Triplett recalled that the man he excused had said that he&rsquo;d been stopped uncounted times over a 14-year period by mostly white officers because of his race and age. &#8220;I have a lot of baggage&#8221; with respect to law enforcement, he had said.</p>
<p>When Triplett asked whether he had reported the incidents, the prospective juror said, &#8220;Seemed like it would be a waste of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Triplett told the judge, &#8220;Whether or not he still harbors any animosity is not something I wanted to roll the dice with.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The African American woman excused from the jury has a master&rsquo;s degree in social work and served an internship in the psychiatric ward at Sacramento County&rsquo;s branch jail in Elk Grove.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t like to keep social workers,&#8221; the prosecutor told the judge. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have any other social workers up on the panel. And, if I had my choice, I wouldn&rsquo;t have any.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith [Jackson attorney Laurence Smith] did not object when Triplett excused the man but did object to both exclusions after the woman was excused.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each of the three lower courts concluded Triplett&rsquo;s reasons were acceptable when measured against legally established race-neutral standards. In addition, they all noted that one juror was African American.<br>

		<p>These judges are as demented as the Knoxville killers.  An entire trial thrown out, a trial based not on on hear say but DNA evidence!  Because two blacks were not allowed on the jury.  Are the judges saying that this man may have been found not guilty if those two blacks were on the jury?  That this lamb of a man should be on the streets with civilized people?  Stick a fork in it, the US is done!</p>

		<p>One matter that appeals courts are supposed to consider is whether the issue at hand would be likely to change the trial&rsquo;s outcome.  This court&rsquo;s decision makes it sound like it believes that one or two black jurors would have changed the verdict.  Whether true or not, this is a shocking finding for any court to make.  There was overwhelming evidence against this defendant and no logical reason to believe that a rational juror of any ethnicity would find him not guilty.  It&rsquo;s arguable whether the social worker should have been excused, but is that enough to allow the convicted a new trial?<br>
Sacramento Co. will be faced with the expense of another trial if the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s enlarged panel of judges agrees with the present judgment.  I don&rsquo;t see any way that a DA will let this monster just run loose.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s  just an advanced tactic in the race war.  White Humanity must follow racial etiquette that favors blacks when the victim is White, otherwise, the black is set free to rob, rape, and murder again.</p>
<p>If you are White, do not expect equal protection under the law when the law is administered by blacks and White Liberal Elites. We are under a tyranny, and the pain will just keep piling up until nature takes its course and we do the right thing.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t we had a case heinous enough for White to rise up and impeach any judge who ever let out a black criminal who recommits?</p>
<p>Eve Carson didn&rsquo;t do it, neither has Channon Christian.</p>
<p>Maybe when we see something captured on video and it gets broadcast about the same time that Oakland and E. St. Louis go up in flames.<br>

		<p>Looks like these judges (two blacks one white) have their own brand of racism going on.  They conclude with no evidence that whites were racist and so they throw out a conviction.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the cost associated with this rapist.  He had two prior strikes, he had a trial for the third strike, then he had a state appellate court review, then he had a federal district court review, and then finally after all that he got a federal appeals court review that essentially just let him go. </p>
<p>How many years do we, taxpayers, have to work to pay for this rapist.  And what about the victims who spend all the energy and anguish trying to get justice.  Three liberal judges just threw it all away.</p>
<p>There is no end to this tyranny.</p>

		<p>While nothing but a remarkable display of sanity from the Ninth Circuit would suprise me, my understanding is that a prerememptory challenge of a prospective juror can be for any reason or no reason.  Challenges for cause require a statement of explanation by the challenging side, which then may or may not be upheld by the presiding judge.</p>
<p>In addition, setting aside a conviction obtained largely through application of DNA testing and evidence appears doubly loony.</p>

		<p>I am not a lawyer, but isn&rsquo;t each side given a certain number of preemptories that can be used with no reason stated.  </p>
<p>I read Vincent Bugliosi&rsquo;s book &#8220;outrage&#8221; about the Simpson trial, and he said the procecutor and defense attorney can each use a certain number of peremptories without any reason stated. The reason could something simple.  It could be they don&rsquo;t like the juror&rsquo;s appearance, mannerisms, or the facial expression, or they just get bad vibes, whatever.  After they use the designated premptories they can still use additional preemptories, but they then have to start giving the judge a reason.  At least that is how it is in California.  In the Simpson case, they used many preemptories.  The jury, as bad as it was, was the best they could get, according to Marcia Clark.</p>

<p>My answer to that is simple: just liquidate the &ldquo;appeals court,&rdquo; and elect another!</p>
<p>We are far beyond listening to &ldquo;legal&rdquo; rubbish and Marxist whimsies regarding &ldquo;African Americans&rdquo; and the rape of white women. Corrective measures need to be taken on this topic, without remorse or compunction. This also includes the other, &ldquo;softer&rdquo; predators, like Asian or Arabs; who can disagree with that?</p>

		<p>We are indeed living under tyranny. We are not any longer a free people. The judge in Arizona and these nitwits in the Ninth Circuit prove it. It&rsquo;s time for the people of this country to ignore rulings such as this by these black robed lawyers. It&rsquo;s time to say you have made your stupid rulings from the bench now let&rsquo;s see you enforce it.  </p>

		<p>I was one of those people that always got called up for jury duty when I lived in NY. All those times and yet I was never asked to serve on a jury. In fact I don&rsquo;t remember any white males being picked. In one case it was so blindingly obvious that it was almost farce. A guy had held up a livery cab driver with a pellet gun. During the voir dire the black defense attorney (guess the race of the perp) kept trying to get me to admit that a misunderstanding over the fare was possible. He was pretty hostile to all whites in the group. They conferred and the judge (guess the ethnicity) announced &#8220;The following jurors are excused&hellip;&#8221; and read off some names. And every white male including myself, about eight of us, got up and walked out. One of the questions they always ask is if you know any law enforcement officers. Well I knew plenty of cops, including my neighbor but I lied and said no. Didn&rsquo;t matter, but a black lady who worked for the school system and admitted to being friendly with cops as well as another one who was married to a cop got empaneled. This has been going on for a long time. </p>

		<p>In the mean time, here in Vancouver, WA we just had a rape of a 13 year old girl (in the news last night) by an adult (looks nearly middle aged) black man, recent new resident, who abducted the girl into a van and then assisted a friend in raping her.  Don&rsquo;t have all the details.  He threatened the girl, broke her nose with a punch, and threatened to harm her family if she resisted further.  He has been arrested and is in court on $500,000.00 bail.  Think he will be convicted?  Think he will serve out his term?</p>

		<p>the fight over the racial composition of juries is hard to understand. When a black is convicted of a crime by an all white jury, the automatic conclusion by blacks is that the jury has to be racist, (which in itself is racist)and that if there were blacks on the jury their man would have gotten off despite the evidence.  But if the evidence does not support the conviction, the judge can throw out the verdict, and even charge the jurors with contempt. Even more, if there were a racist white or 2 on a jury, the other whites would not hesitate to &#8220;out&#8221; them. On the other hand, black jurors have admitted they are more than happy to vote not guilty to &#8220;save a brutha&#8221;, and then there is the fact that blacks have an irrational fear/hate of police and the system, which all by itself is enough to DQ them from jury duty.<br>
It is much easier to make the case for all white juries than it is for forcing blacks on juries.<br>
