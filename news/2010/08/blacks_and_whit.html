<h1><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/141725/Blacks-Whites-Continue-Differ-Sharply-Obama.aspx">Blacks and Whites Continue to Differ Sharply on Obama</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Newport, Gallup, August 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama&rsquo;s job approval rating averaged 88% among blacks and 38% among whites in July, a 50-percentage-point difference that has been consistent in recent months but is much larger than in the initial months of the Obama presidency. Obama&rsquo;s job approval ratings among blacks, whites, and Hispanics in July are all at their lowest levels to date, although the overwhelming majority of blacks still approve.</p>
<p>Issues of race and the Obama presidency have been in the news again in recent weeks with the situation involving Shirley Sherrod, the black Department of Agriculture employee who was fired and then offered a new position at the agency after edited videos of a speech she made dealing with racial matters were widely circulated on the Internet.</p>
<p>Blacks&rsquo; approval of the job Obama is doing dipped below the 90% threshold for the second month in a row in July; the 88% July average is the lowest monthly average approval rating blacks have given Obama yet, although not significantly lower than the 89% recorded in June.</p>
<p>The slight drop in blacks&rsquo; ratings since May matches the pattern among whites and Hispanics. Obama&rsquo;s June and July ratings among whites are the lowest monthly ratings of his administration among that group, as is his 54% July rating among Hispanics.</p>
<p>Whites&rsquo; approval of Obama is down 24 points from the high of 62% in January 2009. Hispanics&rsquo; approval has dropped 28 points from its 82% peak in May 2009. Blacks&rsquo; approval has been much more stable, falling seven points from the high of 95% in June 2009.</p>

		<p>The top line is why the White House has no problem with Pelosi throwing Maxine Waters and Charlie Rangel under the bus   &mdash;   black support will always be there and be near-monolithic.  But both their districts are now heavily and majority Hispanic, and Obama is losing Hispanic support:</p>

		<p>Not to be the arbiter of gloom and doom, but these polls really do not mean anything, especially at this point in time.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can rest assured that the Obama loving media will do everything to ensure that their favorite son will win reelection in 2012. The Republican nominee will be demonized in either a sophisticated or relentless manner.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Obama is losing Hispanic support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here you make an excellent point, as this will likely be as influential in bringing the fool down, as is the sudden realization on the part of whites that this &ldquo;messiah&rdquo; is and always has been nothing but a golden calf. If the radical entitlement Hispanics do not vote, while white turnout increases and absorbs their void, the midterms will see a 1994-like whirlwind in the US Congressional races. This is significant, since while I do not see the Republicans becoming &ldquo;racially conscious&rdquo; or anything close to it, they will fight him out of pure spite and greed for power. </p>
<p>He is not Bill Clinton and his gorgon of a wife is not Hillary; they are both arrogantly inept and too inclined toward grandiosity, to compromise with the Republicans and ride out such a setback.</p>
<p>In short, it will be multiculturalism on the &ldquo;down low&rdquo; and lowdown partisan politics straight to 2012!</p>
<p>All the best to you QD,</p>

		<p>The fact that Hispanics&rsquo; opinions of Obama are also falling, and moving closer to whites, may give the GOP a false sense of security. &#8220;You see, Hispanics don&rsquo;t necessarily gravitate toward the Democrats.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yeah, right. Put a Hispanic in the Oval Office and see how the Hispanics poll. The numbers would be reversed, with the vast majority of Hispanics approving, blacks in the middle, and whites, once again, the &#8220;odd man out.&#8221; </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t discount the importance of race.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama job approval among whites: 38 percent; blacks; 88 percent; Hispanics: 54 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>88%!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about the percentage of blacks I would guess hate whites and white America.</p>
<p>Expecting blacks to be fair, balanced and broadminded is an effort in futility.  Blacks are concerned about nothing but blacks and all things black.</p>
<p>If they had a choice between keeping Obama pres. but the country would collapse as part of the bargain, or saving the country, the country would collapse.</p>
<p>Unable to think and look ahead, these people only understand the here and now.  That&rsquo;s why every black run government is a total failure, especially the ones in Sub-Sahara Africa.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re paying a terrible price for the mistakes of a few of our white ancestors who brought these people to these shores and had them working on their plantations, and it&rsquo;s unfair, because we had no hand in any of it.</p>
<p>How much better off this country would be now if those people had been tried, convicted and hanged for enslavement, while any slave ships were destroyed as they sat at the ports in Africa.</p>

		<p>Sad to say, but anonymous at 6:47 is correct. I think that some of us are a little premature in our belief that Obama is a one term president.</p>
<p>As another poster so aptly mentioned several months ago, there seems to be a many similarities between Obama and Reagan. Reagan had similar numbers at this point. In fact, they were soemwhat lower than Obama&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Another factor that Obama has is a large number of youth (especially youth of color) who will have turned 18 by 2012 and <br>
will be able to vote. Many White youths will give him a second chance. Reagan had a large number of White youths, but Obama has young support accross the racial divide.</p>
<p>Moreover, despite what we are being led to believe, a large number of other non-Whites, including Asians, Hispanics, East Indians, Arabs and radical feminsits will more than likely vote for Obama given the fact that he epitomzies  multiculturalism. In the case of the feminists, he will be seen as &#8220;socking it&#8221; to the White male patriarchy. </p>
<p>As 6:47 also correctly stated, let&rsquo;s not underestimate the power of the Obama loving media. They will do everything in their power to ensure that their favorite son will win reelection.</p>
<p>This is how I see it.</p>

		<p>What does 88% support among blacks even mean, though? The vast majority of blacks are politically ambivalent at best, if not completely clueless regarding the whole process. Blacks like and will continue to like Obama because he is(half)black - that&rsquo;s all it means - nothing more, nothing less.   </p>

		<p>Tim in Indiana:</p>
<p>You said it best. Like anonymous 6:47 stated, I am still amazed at the number of our posters who seem to get all giddy whenever these see these so-called &#8220;accurate&#8221; polls from the lamestream media. </p>
<p>I remember when the media try to fool people about &#8220;conservative tea party&#8221; senator Scott Brown from Massachusetts. Rather than stop and take a look at his record, anumber of our pasoters became giddy with glee. I remeber such comments &#8220;this shoewws that Obama is in trouble&#8221;, &#8221; Already our fellow Whites are waking up&#8221; etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Well we see that &#8220;Mr. Conservative&#8221; has sided with Obama on virtually every issues the presdent has put forth. In all fairness, some of you were not fooled by media shenanigans and your astute comments at the time in regards to Brown&rsquo;s support of abortion, affirmative action etc&hellip; indicated as such. Given the fact that the guy was a republican from Massachusetts should have given any reasonable conservative pause. Republican in that state are RINOS - Republican in name only.</p>
<p>Scott Brown aside, the majority of Hispanics still support Obama as do a large number of Asians.  I think that the media (unfortunately) has skillfully manipulated the image of the tea party as a group of wild eyed fringe nutcases and have successfully tied them to the conservative movement. This is where the real problem is.</p>
<p>I would argue that many Americans are still reluctant to be associated with the tea party. This being said, many of them will be hesitant to cast their ballots for the those republicans who seem to be associated with this segment of the GOP.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the &#8220;lamestream media&#8221; has been successful in miseading the public and more than a few of our fellow Amreners have fell for this sophisticated mirage.   <br>

		<p>Whites didnt elect Obama. The majority of whites voted for the <br>
other guy. For the first time in our history of 234 years <br>
what the majority of white people wanted simply didnt matter.<br>
The consequences of that are upon us. And this is only the very, very beginning of our enslavement to MultiCulturalism.</p>

		<p>Blacks, as a group, are simply immune to reason and intelligent analysis. If voting required an IQ of 85 the majority of them would be disenfranchised immediately, along with a small minority of whites.</p>
<p>The Democrat party would never win another election, either locally or nationally.</p>

		<p>If we&rsquo;re supposed to be a color-blind country, why is every statistic still broken down into race? Because, no matter how &#8216;they &rsquo; deny it, race DOES matter. </p>
<p>In this &#8216;color-blind country&rsquo; there is more focus on race now than there ever has been in society - it permeates every crack& crevice of everything we deal with every day. Our entire societal structure has become obsessed with equaling it, denying it, reparating it, celebrating it, excusing it, punishing it, hiding it, advancing it, legislating it, and simply shoving it down our throats every minute of every day.</p>

		<p>Blacks living in black African countries do not obsess over race, because they are the majority and surrounded by their own kind.  </p>
<p>However, black Africans living in white countries are surrounded by a race that is more intelligent, more attractive, and more accomplished.  </p>
<p>Blacks are aware of this every time they see a white and the black&rsquo;s feelings of inferiority fills them with despair and self-loathing.  </p>
<p>This self-loathing creates racial jealousy which in turn causes them to hate whites with a passion.  <br>

		<p>Obama is not a US &#8220;black&#8221;.  Far from it.  He&rsquo;s a halfbreed foreigner whose father wasn&rsquo;t a US citizen.  THAT is what must be changed.  No federal office of the US should allow a candidate for election who doesn&rsquo;t have provable mother &amp; father who are US citizens.  The fact that that&rsquo;s not in our constitution is mysterious to me.  I&rsquo;d bet that many out there think it is in the constitution, or at least thought so pre-Obama.</p>
<p>What if our next travesty is someone who has neither parent a US citizen, but just so happened to be born here, the ultimate &#8220;anchor baby&#8221;?</p>
<p>Get on this stuff, people.  They want to take our country away.</p>
