<h1>Women, Minorities Biggest Users of Mobile Phones, Survey Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Gross, CNN, August 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Women text and talk on their mobile phones more than men.</p>
<p>African-Americans and Hispanics use their phones more than whites, and Southerners out-chat their northern neighbors while on the go.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those are the findings of a yearlong survey by the Nielsen Co. The statistics firm studied the monthly mobile phone bills of more than 60,000 U.S. customers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the survey&rsquo;s data, black users sent and received about 780 text messages per month and Hispanics got or sent about 767  &mdash;  significantly more than whites, who checked in with 566 texts in the same time period.</p>
<p>Both of those groups, as well as Asians and Pacific Islanders, also talk more on their mobile phones than white customers. Black mobile phone users talked about 1,300 minutes a month, on average, followed by Hispanics at 826, Asians and Pacific Islanders at 692, and whites at 647 minutes.</p>

		<p>I do know for sure that Arabs and Muslims talk ALL the time on their cell phones while WORKING!</p>
<p> Have you ever been into one of their &#8220;Stop and Go&rsquo;s, liquor stores, etc. and ever seen them NOT on their phones? They don&rsquo;t even have the courtesy to get off their phone while serving customers and just keep on talking in their arabic or whatever language they speak.</p>
<p> I want to go somewhere else but they own ALL those stores where I live. What is up with that? They own all the motels also. They come here and all of a sudden they own these businesses while it take Whites years of saving and working hard?</p>

		<p>So whites are more individualistic!</p>
<p>Even Asians aren&rsquo;t as autonomous, individualistic as whites.  Asians are more into conforming and having deep social ties.</p>
<p>Southerners would talk more than Northerners as Southerners are more ethnic (less autonomy/individualism.)</p>
<p>There ya go!  </p>

As someone who rides public transit to work and works downtown, I can also attest that these conversations are inane.</p>
<p>These women and minorities use up countless minutes talking to people they&rsquo;re on their way to see; literally saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;m getting off the bus right now&#8221;. </p>
<p>What would blacks do without white technology?</p>

		<p>This is so true.  I work in an all latino area and every latino I see under about 30 years of age is literally addicted to their cell phones and also their Ipods.  It is bizarre what I see on a daily basis.  Like some orwellian nightmare.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just as tech savvy as the next person, but like most whites I know, I don&rsquo;t need to talk and talk and talk about nothing at all.  When I see white kids, which is rare as we are a species in decline, I notice that they are usually not using cell phones while walking in groups of friends, but latinos just go ga-ga over these little time wasters.</p>

<p>All these groups just are NOT far removed from their tribal lives they shared for thousands of years.  The preference for crowds, crowded areas, constant intercommunication, etc. are inbred within them.</p>
<p>Usually, these types are miserable living in remote rural areas with no heavy contact with other tribal members.</p>
<p>There are VERY few Henry David Thoreaus in the non-white populations.</p>

		<p>Think of it this way, Young people of any race tend to be more mobile. They change apartments often. They don&rsquo;t home phones anymore. White people get older, get steady jobs and buy homes they stay in for a long time. Then they get a house phone to off set the cell-phone minutes.</p>

		<p>People need to do a lot less talking and a lot more listening. What are they saying while chatting endlessly away on their cell phones? Nothing important. While they mindlessly mow you down with their cars or derail a train. And all the young dummies have to say? Oh, my bad.</p>

		<p>actually, all this texting is going to result in a LARGE CROSS SECTION OF SOCIETY getting whalloped by bad times, because their atentions are so narrowly focused on trivial things flitting across a 4 square inch screen. Even white emo-types, trying to keep their pants pulled up (you&rsquo;d thing with their heads up their butts, they&rsquo;d be more concerned with protecting them ), are in a haze, one hand pulling up the jeans that fall off, the other texting at a 1st grade level. They will fall prey to attackers, and never know what took them down. It&rsquo;s kinda&rsquo; funny.</p>

Mister, Used to be I could sell you some!!<br/>
Now I have abandoned the Quickie Mart Life Style.<br/>
What cured me was noticing all the thug oriented shenanigans at 5:00am every morning at my 24 hour store&hellip;<br/>
When I asked Tracy, my Black clerk ally about it he said, &#8220;Don`t you know?!? 5:00am is the new 2:00am!!&#8221;<br/>
That did it for me. Side benefits accrued? I don`t read the morning paper and its anti-white poison any more. That in itself was a visible feel-good move. I don`t eat Slim Jims for breakfast, lunch or dinner any more either. And I get my sodas for 26 cents per drink instead of 89 cents. Soooo, I save 600.00 a year, don`t walk into the lions den on a daily basis and spend my mornings reading AMren and other sites to educate myself&hellip; Win! Win! Win!</p>

<p>Doug Gross can add White college students to that list.  At the large university where I used to work, easily half of all the students one saw walking across campus had cell phones permanently glued to their ears.  And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the ones who insist on yapping inanely on their cell phones while they half-heartedly try to drive.<br/>

		<p>If they text more than my teenage granddaughters, thats SOME talking! Current and future generations are nimble-fingered, numb-minded toadstools. I do know that the vast majority of those Mr. Spock looking plug-in ear phones are seen on blacks. Such important people that they can&rsquo;t separate themselves from a phone for two seconds.  Personally, I&rsquo;m on the phone in an office the biggest part of the day, and I despise phones on my personal time. </p>

		<p>I am a Southern girl, and I see the topic of Southerners texting more, from both angles.</p>
<p>First of all, yes, I agree with a lot of you, that blacks lower our statistics (towards the bad) in a lot of ways.  What gets me is how white liberals go about attacking the South for our crime rates and awful schools, as well as our obesity rates, and they blame it all on Southern white good ole boys.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, liberals act like blacks and Third World people are so advanced.  Are liberals that ignorant and clueless or do they waste their time attacking Southern whites (and red state whites in general) because we are their only threat?</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that any liberal would actually sincerely believe that blacks and Third World immigrants are smarter, and less violent than whites in the South.  There has to be some agenda going on here.</p>
<p>But in any case, to sum it up, just like with obesity, crime, and bad schools, I agree that the black population in the South has a lot to do with our high texting rates.</p>
<p>But, having said that, I also see this from another angle too.  While most of the South&rsquo;s negative statistics are skewed by minorities, one also has to admit that whites in the South overall are less educated etc&hellip;., even if it is to a slight degree, compared to their Northern WHITE (only white and perhaps in some ways Asian) counterparts.</p>
<p>I also think there are traits that Southern whites have that are better than those of Northern whites, so this goes in both directions.  </p>
<p>When looking at the cell phone issue, as a Southern Belle myself, I will happily admit that Southerners (females inparticular) are much more open and talkative than their Northern counterparts.  I myself text my mom a good bit throughout the day.</p>
<p>I also agree with the person who said that there is no way Southern white men spend as much time talking away on their phones as Northern white men do.  I really don&rsquo;t see very many Southern white men spending much time on their cell phones unless it is an emergency. </p>

		<p>Our black private security guards are always on their phones, while they are allegedly running metal detectors, keeping the staff safe, etc&hellip;.and management says NOTHING to them. This is in a corrections facility! </p>
<p>My wife reports that at her job, the black females who almost exclusively staff one phone support division will race to the toilets at break time so that they can use their &#8220;sail fones&#8221; while in the stalls attending to their bodily functions. She related that between the loud talking, the grunting and flushing, its a wonder anyone could hear anything.</p>

		<p>Admittedly I&rsquo;m not a big fan of cell phones. Any call that is purely an interruption to my day, I&rsquo;m going to ask them not to call me again with that kind of thing, and I&rsquo;m very selective about who I give that number to. </p>
<p>I get maybe 20 text messages a month, and I reply to about 3/4 of those. 1000 minutes last me a year, so I have no need for an unlimited plan with unlimited texting. My wife can blow through 1000 minutes in 3 months talking, and probably gets 60 messages a month, and probably sends 80 a month. She&rsquo;s more willing to communicate the time wasters than I am, but women tend to enjoy a talking a lot more period, and feel the need to do it more. </p>
<p>It really makes me wonder how someone can send 700+ texts a month, unless the conversations are purely time wasters. I would be out of sorts with that many interruptions to the day unless a family member was sick, or we were managing a similar type crisis. </p>
<p>Maybe this data is being driven purely by young people; in which case the youths are probably sending 3x that many to make the numbers work. I would love to see this data broken down by age group.   </p>

		<p>The Nielsen Co. could have saved a lot of money by asking any socially aware white this question. I&rsquo;m sure most here have known about the crazy amount of talk time blacks and hispanics spend on the phone. Hears another factoid from Nielson; Blacks watch more T.V., are more likely to have cable/satellite and stay up later watching T.V. All markers for a very immature brain.</p>

		<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m in the south I feel almost handicapped in the talk department compared to most southern whites. There is a really great oral tradition in the south, great storytelling and especially humorous stories and one-liners. So it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that southern whites spend more time on cell phones than northern whites do. Southern whites are as verbally gifted as the Irish. </p>
