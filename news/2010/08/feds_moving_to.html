<h1><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7169978.html">Feds Moving to Dismiss Some Deportation Cases</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Carroll, Houston Chronicle, August 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Department of Homeland Security is systematically reviewing thousands of pending immigration cases and moving to dismiss those filed against suspected illegal immigrants who have no serious criminal records, according to several sources familiar with the efforts.</p>
<p>Culling the immigration court system dockets of noncriminals started in earnest in Houston about a month ago and has stunned local immigration attorneys, who have reported coming to court anticipating clients&rsquo; deportations only to learn that the government was dismissing their cases.</p>
<p>Richard Rocha, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman, said Tuesday that the review is part of the agency&rsquo;s broader, nationwide strategy to prioritize the deportations of illegal immigrants who pose a threat to national security and public safety. Rocha declined to provide further details.</p>
<p>Critics assailed the plan as another sign that the Obama administration is trying to create a kind of backdoor &#8220;amnesty&#8221; program.</p>
<p>Raed Gonzalez, an immigration attorney who was briefed on the effort by Homeland Security&rsquo;s deputy chief counsel in Houston, said DHS confirmed that it&rsquo;s reviewing cases nationwide, though not yet to the pace of the local office. He said the others are expected to follow suit soon.</p>
<p>Gonzalez, the liaison between the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which administers the immigration court system, and the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said DHS now has five attorneys assigned full time to reviewing all active cases in Houston&rsquo;s immigration court.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said DHS attorneys are conducting the reviews on a case-by-case basis. However, he said they are following general guidelines that allow for the dismissal of cases for defendants who have been in the country for two or more years and have no felony convictions.</p>
<p>In some instances, defendants can have one misdemeanor conviction, but it cannot involve a DWI, family violence or sexual crime, Gonzalez [Raed Gonzalez, liaison between the Executive Office for Immigration Review and the American Immigration Lawyers Association] said.</p>
<p><b>Massive backlog of cases</b></p>
<p>Opponents of illegal immigration were critical of the dismissals.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ve made clear that they have no interest in enforcing immigration laws against people who are not convicted criminals,&#8221; said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for strict controls.</p>
<p>&#8220;This situation is just another side effect of President Obama&rsquo;s failure to deliver on his campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority in his first year,&#8221; said U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. &#8220;Until he does, state and local authorities are left with no choice but to pick up the slack for prosecuting and detaining criminal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez called the dismissals a necessary step in unclogging a massive backlog in the immigration court system. In June, there were more than 248,000 cases pending in immigration courts across the country, including about 23,000 in Texas, according to data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Memo outlines priorities</b></p>
<p>Immigrants who have had their cases terminated are frequently left in limbo, immigration attorneys said, and are not granted any form of legal status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a June 30 memo, ICE Assistant Secretary John Morton outlined the agency&rsquo;s priorities, saying it had the capacity to remove about 400,000 illegal immigrants annually  &mdash;  about 4 percent of the estimated illegal immigrant population in the country. The memo outlines priorities for the detention and removal system, putting criminals and threats to national security at the top of the list.</p>
<p><b>Up to 17,000 cases</b></p>
<p>On Tuesday, ICE officials provided a copy of a new policy memo from Morton dated Aug. 20 that instructs government attorneys to review the court cases of people with pending applications to adjust status based on their relation to a U.S. citizen. Morton estimates in the memo that the effort could affect up to 17,000 cases.</p>

		<p>This is our punishment for failing (just barely) to make being an illegal alien a felony.  Had that happened, this would have been impossible.</p>
<p>After November, this must be a priority.  Simply being in the US must be a felony, with minimum federal sentencing guidelines of years of prison time.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t ANY illegal activity a threat to public safety? That&rsquo;s why things are illegal, right?</p>
<p>I understand it&rsquo;s more important to deport an illegal rapist before an illegal traffic violator, but to dismiss all of them seem&rsquo;s like selective prosecution.</p>

		<p>This is consistent with the internal Obama administration memo reported by AP July 30 indicating that keeping illegal aliens in the U. S. is a top administration priority.  Quoting: </p>
<p>&ldquo;WASHINGTON  &mdash;  The Obama administration, unable to push an immigration overhaul through Congress, is considering ways it could go around lawmakers to allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States, according to an agency memo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The internal draft written by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services outlines ways that the government could provide &#8216;relief&rsquo; to illegal immigrants  &mdash;  including delaying deportation for some, perhaps indefinitely, or granting green cards to others &hellip;&rdquo;  (&ldquo;Agency weighs, skirting Congress on immigration,&rdquo; Associated Press, July 30, 2010):<br>

<p>Laughing Out Loud In Utter And Abject Disgust!</p>
<p>It is not just General Secretary BO and his merry band Stalinists doing this, but the Peoples&rsquo; Deputies in both chambers of the USSA&rsquo;s Congress of the Interior and Exterior. Be they Stalinists (i.e., Democrats)  or Trotskyites (i.e., Neo-Con Republicans,)  the goal is always the same:</p>
<p>1.) A USSA dominated global &ldquo;government&rdquo; with the UN as an inconsequential, but also integral, cheerleading squad;</p>
<p>2.) A desperately brutalized, mongrelized, ignorant, and impoverished swarming horde of humanity dependent upon them and their handouts;</p>
<p>3.) A presently destabilized and demoralized world where ethnic-religious conflicts and warfare, allow them  to obtain points 1 and 2 in the long march toward a &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; Utopian Terra Incognita Americana.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>What the Federal government is saying is that it is OK for foreigners to commit crimes IF it is for the purpose of making more money (i.e., illegally entering the USA in order to obtain a higher salary and get free stuff like free education, food stamps, Section 8 housing, medical care, etc.).  </p>
<p>But this sets a very bad precedent   &mdash;   if foreigners can break our laws to get stuff, why can&rsquo;t USA Citizens do the same?  Why shouldn&rsquo;t you or I cheat on our taxes or steal from the government, if it will benefit us and our families?  After all, I have &#8220;strong family values,&#8221; and I &#8220;just want a better life for me and my children.&#8221;  </p>
<p>If a Mexican wants &#8220;a better life&#8221;, they break into America and steals social services from taxpayers.  If I want a better life, shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to break into a store and steal stuff?  What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>It is cynical and wrong when our government says that citizens must obey laws, but foreigners do not have to.  </p>

		<p>Raed Gonzalez, an immigration attorney -</p>
<p>HE is a BIG part of the problem! How is a &#8220;Rael Gonzales&#8221; able to BE an immigration attorney in a White nation? I doubt that Mexico, Asia, The Middle East and Africa have any &#8216;Brandon Schultzs&rsquo; as immigration attorneys -  for obvious reasons. They&rsquo;re more sane than we are! A lot of them live in filthy, disease ridden hell holes, but they have more pride in their race than the average White American. I will go to my grave never understanding this.   </p>

The difference is that the Mexicans aren&rsquo;t stealing. What&rsquo;s going on here is the equivalent of a thief breaking into a store and the owner giving him his entire stock, whilst knowingly starving his own family. And then &#8220;feeling good&#8221; about it.</p>

		<p>In the little city of Huntington, WV, a Mexican drug lord recently took a plea of 20-to-life to avoid murder charges in the black-tar heroin deaths of 14 people.  I remember reading in the paper that this man was coming to town.  He barely speaks English, so I assume he&rsquo;s illegal.  The authorities knew he was coming to set up a drug operation, so, if he&rsquo;s illegal, why wasn&rsquo;t he just deported in the first place?</p>

		<p>It can&rsquo;t be economic.</p>
<p>If these people are -such- a burden on the social services system and Obama just added -another- lamprey to this system in the form of medical insurance for everyone while opening the immigration doors ever wider, then the CMICs _must_ realize that, with the debt we have, the open borders policy we have and the welfare state we are creating, that they are signing the death warrant of not just our economy but of the the United States itself and with it, their own Job Security.  </p>
<p>Forget &#8216;electing a new polity&rsquo; for Democratic votes.  If there is no government, it won&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Given the USD will be worth all of a .02 on the Yuan when this happens, there is also no reasonable justification for a get rich quick scheme because even the wealthy will not be able to flee to anywhere that will have them at 1 percent of their U.S. value.  Like Germany in the mid 20s when reparations, a complete economic collapse and a rampant devaluation of the currency made a loaf of bread cost 1 trillion marks.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just wrongheaded.  It is evil.</p>
<p>NO ONE WILL PROFIT FROM THIS.  ALL WILL SUFFER ENORMOUSLY.</p>

Why wasn&rsquo;t he deported in the first place? Yes, he should have been. Immediately. But he was involved in the drug trade? Then he probably paid off a lot of people to be left alone. The corruption in our system is tremendous, with so many cops, judges and feds on the take this story is not surprising, just the usual.<br>

		<p>Mass immigration is a policy of genocide against white people,  that must always be explicitly said when commenting on immigration policy (over and over all across the net until it&rsquo;s being explicitly said everywhere, it can&rsquo;t be suppressed,  and people must then choose between defending it as a form of genocide or eugenics or opposing it).  It has no real economic component and it&rsquo;s only somewhat political (importing votes for Democrats),  the reality is that it is an irrational  fundamentalist religious mania of the Left - the idea that whites are standing in the way of equality and a world-wide utopia that requires their elimination - and the left will support it no matter what the political, environmental or economic consequences are.   They will support it even if it means a Muslim majority in their country that opposes everything they allegedly stand for.   (For the &#8220;minorities&#8221; who are members of this coalition the motivation is just straight hate and loot.)  They&rsquo;re going to use any trick they can and they&rsquo;ll get away with it because no one who matters has the nerve or decency to say what it is actually all about in plain language.  </p>
