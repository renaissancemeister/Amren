<h1><a href="http://www.physorg.com/news201791431.html">More Research Needed on Cardiovascular Disease in Asian-Americans</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Physorg.com, August 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There are marked differences in heart disease risk and occurrence among Asian-American subgroups, but data on these subgroups is limited, prompting the American Heart Association to call for more research on this fastest-growing racial/ethnic group in the U.S., according to a scientific statement published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;Available research shows that subgroups of Asian-Americans are at increased risk of complications and death from cardiovascular disease; however, Asian-Americans are often studied as a group, which masks the differences within this heterogeneous population,&#8221; according to Latha Palaniappan, M.D., M.S., chair of the American Heart Association&rsquo;s Scientific Advisory on Cardiovascular Disease in Asian-Americans.</p>
<p>Asian-Americans represent 25 percent of all foreign-born people in the U.S. They are projected to reach nearly 34 million by 2050. Major federal surveys have only recently started to classify Asian-Americans into seven subgroups: Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and Other Asian. The first six subgroups together constitute more than 90 percent of Asian-Americans in the U.S., according to the statement.</p>
<p>Palaniappan and her colleagues reviewed published research on Asian-Americans and cardiovascular disease, then identified gaps in knowledge and made recommendations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The statement cites some of the following risk differences between Asian-American subgroups:</p>
<p>* Asian Indians and Filipinos are at greater risk of coronary heart disease compared to the other subgroups.</p>
<p>* Japanese- and Chinese-Americans have lower rates of coronary heart disease but higher rates of stroke.</p>
<p>* Chinese-Americans have lower rates of peripheral arterial disease, or clotting diseases of the leg arteries, than other groups.</p>
<p>The statement identifies research showing that risk factors for Asian-Americans differ compared to Caucasians. For example, body mass index, a common tool for determining risk for cardiovascular disease, is considered normal when it&rsquo;s less than 25 kg/m2 for Caucasians. However, a BMI under 23 kg/m2 may be more appropriate for Asians, she said.</p>
<p>Some studies also show that Asian-Americans metabolize drugs, including those used to treat heart disease, differently than Caucasians and other racial/ethnic groups.</p>

		<p>Just look at Indians.  They are the Brazil of Asia:  Miscegenation Central.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
&#8220;[India probably was] a territory that was&hellip;conquered by the Aryan invaders and ruled by them&hellip;. The inevitable result was miscegenation, both biological and cultural. The consequence of the long and intimate association of the dominant Aryans with their subjects of a different race&hellip;was that &#8220;a spirit alien in nature,&#8221; corresponding to the dilution and hybridization of the racial stock&hellip;. What happened, in other words, was a kind of spiritual mongrelization that, in all probability, largely preceded and certainly facilitated the biological mongrelization.&#8221;   </p>
<p>~ Revilo P. Oliver, &#8220;Ritual and Aryan Worship&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Nevertheless, the latest evidence of modern genetic research indicates that the peoples of both north and south India are of mixed Mongoloid/Australoid/Caucasoid racial ancestry, consisting of an autochthonous sub-Gangetic base which has been gradually combined, through a series of population expansions and the historical migrations of various immigrants, with west Eurasian and East Asian elements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;India has been peopled by human groups carrying a diversity of genes and cultural traits. [Indians] have almost all the primary ethnic strains Proto-Australoid, Mediterranean, Mongoloid, Negrito and a number of composite strains.&#8221; ~ Bhasin, Genetics of Castes and Tribes of India</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s best if we leave the study of other races to countries from which they originate. We should focus on the majority ethnicity. After all, countries like Japan and China are not hindered by such problems.</p>

		<p>My cardiologist told me that when they do get an oriental patient it is usually a bad case. They do not get heart disease like we do but if they do get it it is harder on them for some reason. Of course they see more cases as the orientals start taking on our dietary habits. </p>
