<h1>Pro-Vatican Politicians Irked by Gadhafi in Rome</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NPR, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Premier Silvio Berlusconi held talks with Moammar Gadhafi on Monday aimed at promoting the two nations&rsquo; economic ties, but public attention remained focused on the Libyan leader&rsquo;s efforts to persuade Italians to convert to Islam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gadhafi arrived in Rome a day earlier and promptly gave a lesson on Islam to a few hundred young Italian women recruited by a modeling agency and paid to attend the lecture. Gadhafi handed out copies of the Quran, urged the women to convert, and participants said three young women converted on the spot.</p>
<p>On Monday, he had another session with many of the same young women, who arrived by the busload. Some were modestly dressed. Others tottered on high heels and wore dresses with plunging necklines. At least two were seen wearing a Muslim-style veil. Another woman showed off a necklace she was given with a photo of Gadhafi dangling from it.</p>
<p>A few women leaving the session told Associated Press Television that Gadhafi lectured them again about religion. Another woman told Sky TG24 TV that the Libyan leader told them that women in his country had more freedom than those in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rocco Buttiglione, head of the Union of Christian Democrats, told La Repubblica daily Monday  &mdash;  apparently in jest  &mdash;  that if he were to go to Libya to try to persuade Muslims to convert to Christianity, &#8220;you can bet I wouldn&rsquo;t come back in one piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>The small opposition Italy of Values party protested outside the Libyan Embassy, with Sen. Stefano Pedica telling APTN that Gadhafi was &#8220;making fun of our country, from the moment he stepped down from his plane.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As part of the friendship treaty, Libya agreed to crack down on the thousands of African migrants who set off from Libyan shores for Italy. Berlusconi&rsquo;s key coalition partner in his conservative coalition is the anti-immigrant Northern League party.</p>
<p>Under the treaty, Italy agreed to pay Libya $5 billion over 20 years as compensation for its 30-year occupation. Most of that money will come in the form of Italy&rsquo;s building a highway across Libya, from the border with Egypt to the border with Tunisia. Three consortiums of Italian companies will be involved in that ambitious project.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The longtime Libyan leader used his nearly 40-minute speech to urge the European Union to pay Libya &#8220;at least euro5 billion (almost $6.5 billion) a year&#8221; for Tripoli to stop the waves of clandestine African migrants who sail from the country&rsquo;s Mediterranean shores in smugglers&rsquo; boats toward Western Europe.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Gadhafi warned, some day, Europe &#8220;could turn into Africa&#8221; with million of immigrants.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Libya has long been an important supplier of oil and natural gas to Italy.  Libya&rsquo;s central bank has a 4 percent share in Unicredit, Italy&rsquo;s largest bank.&#8221; </p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s the key to it! Oil and money.</p>
<p>Before WWII, Italy owned Libya (just as Britain owned Iraq and Kuwait).  If well enough had only been left alone, Europeans today would not have to grovel or convert in order to get access to what they once had. Just another disastrous consequence of WWII, which we thought was a Great Victory, but which actually  has proven everywhere to have been the &#8216;Great Defeat&rsquo; of the West. Since then, it&rsquo;s been downhill in all white nations as we&rsquo;ve been dispossed and invaded from all sides by the third world. From Norway to Italy   &mdash;   Britain, France, Germany, Spain (and America, Canada, and Australia too) - the invasion is underway and Islam is on the march, while we continue to back down, appease, apologize, and grovel. This should never have been necessary!</p>

		<p>Gadhafi&rsquo;s a clown, and so are the &#8220;converting&#8221; models.  I suggest Italians ignore this little media sideshow and concentrate on the agreement with Libya to take custody of Africans.  The more illegals Lybia grabs, the better, so don&rsquo;t muddy the waters.  Boatloads of Africans are a danger to Italian society - three silly models aren&rsquo;t!  </p>

<p>And  this was reported on NPR, without the slightest sense of irony?</p>
<p>Just imagine what that clique of spongy-spoken and white wine sipping Obamaniacs would have dreamily denounced as &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; had Premier Berlusconi even hinted that was what he wanted to prevent for Italy and Europe? </p>
<p>They would have had to cut to a &ldquo;musical selection&rdquo; of traditional Bedouin chants and rhythmically re-mixed camel grunts, simply to compose themselves.</p>

		<p>Gadhafi can blackmail Europe because of Europe&rsquo;s misplaced empathy towards non-Europeans.  If the Europeans were to just sink a few refugee ships that entered Italian, Spanish or French territorial waters illegally, after fair warning of course, combined with repatriation of all illegal aliens they would stop coming.  But the camp of the saints won&rsquo;t do that.  The sad fact is Africa&rsquo;s huge population explosion is supported by white foreign aid.  Stop the foreign aid and the emigration and Africa&rsquo;s population would eventually stabilize due to a combination of starvation and warfare.  Then, and only then, when forced to deal with their own problems on their own will they ever learn to stand on their own two feet.  Tough love so to speak.</p>
<p>The Europeans might also become a bit more prolific if the supply of easy labor were to dry up.  They might even become innovative and learn how to do more with less people.  Perhaps all three cultures, if left to live apart (Europeans, Arabs/North Africans and black Africans) would develop to their full capacities.  Trade, yes, emigration no.<br>

<p>Women converting to a religion that makes them the property of men in all things, and murdered or stoned to death if they commit adultery, or have their hands cut off if they pick up something that isn&rsquo;t theirs, has got to attract converts that are masochistic, insane, or just plain stupid.</p>

		<p>Honors to the leader of the revolution?</p>
<p>How about the man who helped finance the PLF executioners of a wheelchair bound cripple onboard the Italian flagged liner the Achille Lauro?  Oh that&rsquo;s right, you let the mastermind of that wonderful piece of international relations go free so that we could catch him again in 2003 and -then- you could demand the rights to try him.</p>
<p>How about the man whose intelligence service, less than two months later, helped plant bombs in Vienna and Italy which killed 20 odd people?</p>
<p>How about the Labelle Discotech bombings which injured some 200 people that had never even /heard/ the name Qaddafi?</p>
<p>Or Lockerby?  259 dead there in a war you had nothing to gain or lose from.</p>
<p>How typical of Italy that she ask economic allies to pay jizya for a country NOT to -continue- making illicit attacks on her borders.  While her own companies and corporate barons make billions.</p>
<p>The Italian occupation of Libya ended in 1947 &#8216;but hey, while they were there&rsquo;-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
In Libya, the Italians in less than thirty years (1911-1940) built huge public works (roads, buildings, ports, etc..) and the Libyan economy flourished again at a level similar to the one enjoyed during the Roman empire.</p>
<p>Italian farmers cultivated lands that had been lost to the desert for centuries. Even archaeology flourished (Leptis Magna was rediscovered as a symbol of the Italian rights to colonize the region). Libya was considered the new &#8220;America&#8221; for the Italian emigrants in the thirties.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_as_Italian_colony" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_as_Italian_colony</a></p>
<p>Libya has been a hole ever since.  Even with the discovery of oil.  For pity&rsquo;s sake the man is living in A TENT.</p>
<p>All&rsquo;s I gotta say you poor slobs is that it takes significantly less than 5 billion dollars a year on blood money to mount .50s on fast boats and make every legitimate boater part of a network comms system with mandated stop-and-search rights.</p>
<p>Find&rsquo;em, sink&rsquo;em, let the bastards swim back.  The message will be made loud and clear and you won&rsquo;t have to rely on a terrorist transvestite to &#8216;keep you safe from Africanization&rsquo;.  Look to Belgium and your own buddies in the EU for the source of that problem.</p>
<p>In the end, I think it was Winston Churchill who summarized it best when discussing the prowess of Italians as national partners in war: &#8220;Axis?  Great we were stuck with them the last time!&#8221;</p>
<p>It appears something else hasn&rsquo;t changed in 70 years.  Even in peace.</p>

<p>I agree with # 6 Skip. HE MIGHT NOT COME BACK IN ONE PIECE!</p>
<p>The Colonel [he was actually a Captain at the time when he did the coup d&rsquo;etat] has been doing this sort of stuff for OVER forty years now. And no end in sight. His sons are no better either.</p>
<p>Those thousands of migrants that the Colonel professes to be so worried about - - he aids and abets them the entire way. The ONLY REASON they can cross Libya and embark for Europe is BECAUSE OF HIM!</p>

		<p>I wish to point out that the Egypt-to-Tunisia highway, crossing the intermediate of Libya, is likely done to cement the coming &#8220;Mediterranean Union&#8221; and not as colonial reparation. </p>
<p>Actually, paying Libya some cash to stop the flow of sub-Saharans across its territory does sound fair, given the added police and border equipment. Only a price need be negotiated (much less than the asking.) </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true that Ghadafy is a clown, but it is also truly scary that he&rsquo;s treated like royalty by dhimmi European countries.  It won&rsquo;t be long before Obama, the messiah himself, will be flying to Libya to kiss Ghaddafy&rsquo;s ring.  Libya&rsquo;s ruler was smart enough to publicly denounce the quest for weapons of mass destruction.  They are unnecessary when the EU and the US openly embrace the menace of Islam.  Some interesting videos on youtube  &mdash;  I think someone is trying to stir up Ghaddafy and the rest:</p>

A very telling comment&hellip;Gaddhafi maybe a clown but he`s no fool<br>
He knows many Europeans,esp Italians, fear an increase in the hordes trying to flee the hell holes of sub Saharan Africa etc <br>
Me thinks he might have a copy of `the Camp of the Saints`alongside the Koran as he blackmails Italy for billions while he assumes the self proclaimed and indeed from an historical point of view the  ironic role of Europes `Gatekeeper` or `Protector` <br>
 I predict he`ll step up this rhetoric and I am not surprised if a few other North African nations will follow in his lead<br>
to gain some `protection money` themselves      </p>

He was the biggest  enemy of the white race and the cause of more destruction of white lives, culture, wealth and self regard than all the muslims (or any of our other enemies put together) in history. </p>
