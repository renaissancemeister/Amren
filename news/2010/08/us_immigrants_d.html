<h1>US Immigrant&rsquo;s Dream Ends with Genocide Allegation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynne Tuohy, San Francisco Chronicle, August 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Beatrice Munyenyezi brought her three daughters to the United States from war-ravaged Rwanda in 1998 and focused on the American Dream: private schooling for her girls, a home with a swimming pool, a sport utility vehicle.</p>
<p>Before long, she had a $13-an-hour job at Manchester&rsquo;s Housing Authority in New Hampshire, her children were enrolled in Catholic school, and she was on her way to financing a comfortable American lifestyle through mortgages, loans and credit cards.</p>
<p>Now the 40-year-old mother sits behind bars, held without bond while she awaits trial on federal citizenship fraud charges for allegedly lying about involvement in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, when at least 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.</p>
<p>Authorities say she was an extremist Hutu who killed and enabled the rapes of untold Tutsi victims  &mdash;  not the innocent refugee she claimed to be in 1995 to gain U.S. entry, when she applied for a visa and for citizenship.</p>
<p>Munyenyezi (moon-yehn-YEH&rsquo;-zee) has pleaded not guilty to two counts of lying to obtain U.S. citizenship on her refugee and naturalization applications, by denying any role in the Rwanda genocide. She is scheduled for trial in May 2011.</p>
<p>Her dream life apparently ended, it started falling apart years earlier. She filed for bankruptcy in May 2008, walking away from hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt: a $222,000 mortgage, $14,125 in student loans, $4,198 in municipal taxes and fees and $30,000 in credit card and other unsecured debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;She lived here for probably two years without paying her mortgage; she didn&rsquo;t pay her bills for a good two years,&#8221; said Tom Prince of Manchester, who lived across the street from Munyenezi. &#8220;We all feel she took advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;She knew nothing about owning a home,&#8221; Prince said. &#8220;She never said, &#8216;Thank you.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently she also knows nothing about bankruptcy or student loans.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy, as it turns out, does not absolve one of student loan debt.</p>

		<p>How was it possible for a person of modest earning power to have so much credit extended to her? I guess this has been repeated endlessly all over the USA, only to have the reckless bankers get rescued by the general public. Insofar as the Hutu-Tutsi situation in Rwanda has played out, I&rsquo;d be cautious in jumping to any conclusions. The subject is very complex and foggy; it&rsquo;s poorly understood by most people and is prone to distortion and oversimplification. I wouldn&rsquo;t want us to get sucked into any intra-African dispute, nor do I think we should be in the business of importing all the so-called refugees that continent produces.   </p>

<p>This person sounds to have been an enabler. Did not do the killing herself, but just aided and abetted the process.</p>
<p>This too is how those NAZI SS men that sneaked into the U.S. in the years after the war were prosecuted. For immigration violations. But WAIT, maybe she can apply for the O amnesty and short circuit the process. Yeah, sure, I am so smart.</p>

		<p>$13 an hour job, and she got a loan for  $222,000 ?Ill bet that the bank was forced to lend her the money, just like millions of others that shouldnt have qualified for loans.She got two years of good living in a good home and didnt pay anything.</p>

		<p>What a country!</p>
<p>Can you believe they allowed this tribal woman and her daughters straight out of Africa, into America, gave them massive credit and then expected anything other than what happened - default - at our expense no less.</p>
<p>Of course, the daughters can&rsquo;t be inhumanely deported because of the sins of the mother.  Isn&rsquo;t that always the response?</p>

		<p>This invader from Africa is one brazen character. She moved to a overwhelmingly white state and community, took out a $220,000 loan that she could never re-pay and then decided to stop paying her bills. Plus she lied and schemed her way to get here in the first place. If only the folks from the Lutherans church, Catholic Charities and the Kennedy clan had people like her moving across the street from them this problem would be nipped in the bud.</p>

		<p>It is not RIGHT that this this lying, conniving person be given loans for anything! In a righteous age, she would not even be in this country!</p>

<p>And you are surprised by this? How so? I will wager that MOST of these refugees and immigrants in America today are all the same way. In fact, I would say most are involved in fraud and even the so-called doctors and business owners, etc.., are the top of the fraud and stealing from American taxpayers. Ever hear about all that Medicare and medical fraud schemes from these foreigners in our midst?</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe (actually, I <i>can</i> believe) that this African was so utterly clueless about things like mortgages.  Did she think she was living some sort of MagicLand?  Her not saying &#8220;thank you&#8221; is also not at all surprising.  I&rsquo;ve never heard or read of an African saying thanks to Europeans for anything.</p>

<p><br>
Any immigrant to America who thinks they can have all that based on a $13-an-hour job, is an idiot. </p>
<p>But any American businessperson or bureaucrat who AGREED to give her all that stuff on credit, based a $13-an-hour job, is an even bigger idiot. Why were all these loans allowed? Why did none of the Americans who signed off on these loans say to this African, &#8220;Sorry ma&rsquo;am, but if you&rsquo;re earning only $13-an-hour there&rsquo;s just NO WAY we can lend you hundreds of thousands of dollars for a house, or let you run up tens of thousands in credit-card debt. Come back when you have a better job or some collateral or a decent down payment&#8221; etc?</p>
<p>I believe the answer to my question is contained in my question itself: these American businesspeople and bureaucrats agreed to all this foolhardy generosity to this African BECAUSE she was African. </p>

		<p>I just read Hirsi Ali&rsquo;s book &#8216;Nomad&rsquo;, and she devoted a chapter to talking about how third-worlders can&rsquo;t handle money and finances in the same way that westerners can. In Holland, where Hirsi Ali originally settled, she talked of how all her fellow Somalis had built up horrendous debts. It didn&rsquo;t seem to occur to them that when you borrow money, or spend lavishly using a credit card, that you have to pay the money back. Now, whenever I see a &#8216;refugee&rsquo; driving a fancy car, I no longer feel the churning discontent I did before - now I just figure they&rsquo;re digging themselves into a financial hole that will result in serious repercussions (for them).</p>
<p>Of course, Hirsi Ali did mention that a number of Somalis in Holland had built up such overwhelming debts that they absconded to Sweden or England, as they couldn&rsquo;t possibly pay back what they owed. Which meant that the Dutch private-sector and taxpayers were left footing the bill.</p>

		<p>Sadly, I personally know of many immigrants who think they hit the lotto when they come here.  When they get some small potaoes job they open up 8-10 credit cards and max them out.  They get a house with a pool, a mercedes or BMW and live the highlife.</p>
<p>Do they pay their bills?  Some do, some don&rsquo;t, but the result is the same: they declare bankruptcy and start the process over with a slightly changed spelling of their name.  If it gets too bad, they abscond with the goods and go back to their countries for a few years and then come back for maore later.</p>
<p>Where I live, this is very, very common, and people talk about it and just shake their heads.  Russian jews, dominicans and indians are renowned for this in this city.</p>

<p>This is just one more consequence of a politically-twisted leftist establishment economic system that mandates waving of rules for certain racial categories. A long string of Democrat laws exist to throw obstacles in the way of banks and credit card companies to simply enforce basic business practice, and also to specifically mandate preference to racial categories. The large business costs of these Democrat laws are automatically added on to the costs all honest Americans pay.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see. Did she sit down with a US map back in her native Rwanda and point to New Hampshire, and say:  &#8220;That place looks nice.  THAT&rsquo;s the place where I want to live!&#8221; <br>
 <br>
Nope.  I hardly think so.  She wouldn&rsquo;t have known what New Hampshire was   &mdash;   a make of car or a local dish or what.</p>
<p>Obviously, some goody-goody, busy-body, do-good agency decided that NH was just too lily white and is in need of some Diversity. So she was SENT there. </p>
<p>These settlement agencies are The Enemy!</p>
