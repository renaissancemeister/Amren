<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=190709">Bean-Counters and Baloney</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Sowell, WorldNetDaily, August 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Two New York Times sport writers have discovered that baseball coaches from minority groups are found more often coaching at first base than at third base. Moreover, third-base coaches become managers more often than first-base coaches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the heart of such statistics is the implicit assumption that different races, sexes and other subdivisions of the human species would be proportionately represented in institutions, occupations and income brackets if there were not something strange or sinister going on.</p>
<p>Although this notion has been repeated by all sorts of people, {snip} there is not one speck of evidence behind it and a mountain of evidence against it.</p>
<p>Ask the bean-counters where in this wide world have different groups been proportionally represented. They can&rsquo;t tell you. In other words, something that nobody can demonstrate is taken as a norm, and any deviation from that norm is somebody&rsquo;s fault!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anyone who has watched football over the years has probably seen at least a hundred black players score touchdowns  &mdash;  and not one black player kick the extra point. Is this because of some twisted racist who doesn&rsquo;t mind black players scoring touchdowns but hates to see them kicking the extra points?</p>
<p>At our leading engineering schools  &mdash;  M.I.T., CalTech, etc.  &mdash;  whites are under-represented and Asians over-represented. Is this anti-white racism or pro-Asian racism? Or are different groups just different?</p>
<p>As for baseball, I have long noticed that there are more blacks playing centerfield than third-base. Since the same people hire centerfielders and third-basemen, it is hard to argue that racism explains the difference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Years ago, a study was made of the ethnic make-up of military forces in countries around the world. Nowhere was the ethnic make-up of the military the same as the ethnic make-up of the population, or even close to the same.</p>
<p>Nearly half the pilots in the Malaysia&rsquo;s air force were from the Chinese minority, rather than the Malay majority. In Nigeria, most of the officers were from the southern tribes and most of the enlisted men were from the northern tribes. {snip}</p>
<p>In countries around the world, all sorts of groups differ from each other in all sorts of ways, from rates of alcoholism to infant mortality, education and virtually everything that can be measured, as well as in some things that cannot be quantified. If black and white Americans were the same, they would be the only two groups on this planet who are the same.</p>
<p>One of the things that got us started on heavy-handed government regulation of the housing market were statistics showing that blacks were turned down for mortgage loans more often than whites. {snip}</p>
<p>What they [the bean-counters] didn&rsquo;t tell you was that whites were turned down more often than Asians. What they also didn&rsquo;t tell you was that black-owned banks also turned down blacks more often than whites. {snip}</p>

		<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget that Asians would be granted funds which would not be granted to poor white students who had been accepted to MIT but could not afford the tuition.</p>
<p>I was accepted to MIT and wound up in such a situation then had to settle for a cheaper college.</p>

		<p>Ok so here&rsquo;s a hypothetical for the Amren folks&hellip;..</p>
<p>You are given the choice between two candidates for President:  Thomas Sowell and Dennis Kucinich.</p>
<p>Who gets your vote?</p>
<p>And &#8220;I&rsquo;ll just stay home&#8221; is a copout.</p>

		<p>In answer to the political choice between Thomas Sowell and Dennis Kuchinich, I would probably go with Kuchinish, only because of his considerable political savvy.  Sowell, however, is one of the few black scholars who can actually see that ethnic and racial differences are not due, in many cases, to discriminatory barriers arbitrarily raised by whites.  They are due to inherent disparities in ability and preferences.  He might have mentioned the NBA where 78% of all players are black. I don&rsquo;t see the administration intervening in favor of white players; let&rsquo;s face it: they are not as good, so they sit on the bench.  True equality&hellip;</p>

		<p>Wow, complete sports lib evisceration by Thomas Sowell.  Sports libs are the worst kind of libs, they idolize blacks in ways that normal libs wouldn&rsquo;t even dream of.  I think that white liberals should volunteer to go to jail in large numbers to normalize the black/white prison gap while blacks should volunteer to remove themselves from public sector employment in which they extraordinarily overrepresented.   </p>

		<p>Absolutely true. Like Jared Taylor said in a youtube video about immigrants: &#8220;Liberal are used to point any differences and say it would be because of white racism. Most of the cases this is absolutely ridiculous. There are more black basketball player in the NBA than whites, is this because of racism too?&#8221;</p>
<p>@ 1  &mdash;  Anonymous<br>
I see more and more intelligent people realize the bias of the liberals. I am sure in the next decades the only whites who will survived will be the right-wing ones. And there will be enough of them. Then people can talk about equal rights again as white should have the same right to have funds for whites only as Asians for Asians only.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this kind of nonsense is goimg to go by the board.  Conditions are in process which will return these bizarre and stark multicults to the real world.  Back to basics is going to be the theme of the very near future.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>Finances will dictate the changes taking place.  For example, I&rsquo;ve harped incessantly about how the economic deterioration is at the cusp of requiring everybody and everything to cut back drastically, which means the nonsense items like AA and free scholarships for low scoring blacks won&rsquo;t be funded, simply because the money is fast disappearing.  This is our time to look at the biased academics and ask them, &#8220;How are you now going to initiate some unfair program to whites with your crooked non-white gimme schemes?&#8221;</p>
<p>THe UK is warning that university budgets will be drastically cut.  While the below article concerns just UK institutions the situation is representative of the same condition here in the US:  Money for schools is dropping rapidly.  The unfair programs will be on the chopping block throughout the US, just as they are in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;Universities face &#8216;biggest cuts since Great Depression&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2undb92" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2undb92</a></p>
<p>This &#8220;bean counting&#8221; the above article refers to is slowly  becoming a thing of the past.  But, look for acceleration to take place SOON. </p>
<p>Academia will be melting down and many will have to cut nonsense course like black and women studies.  </p>
<p>And no matter how much turmoil it will cause in other sectors of society I don&rsquo;t care one whit.  If it takes financial destruction to rid ourselves of these PC miscreants, so be it.</p>

<p>The only black-owned bank in St. Louis didn&rsquo;t draw subprime mortgages.</p>

		<p>Where is the outcry in the phony press regarding poor whites who, despite being qualified, are routinely rejected in favor of Jewish and afro/Carib/Latin types. The Jews are smart but not that smart. They make up 40% of harvard. Clearly the fix is in. The others are affirmact babies. Those who founded and built this country get short shrift from the elites and media.</p>
