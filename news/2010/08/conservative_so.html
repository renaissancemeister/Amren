<h1>Conservative Song Costs Coach His Job</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charlie Butts, OneNewsNow, August 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Twenty-six-year-old Bryan Glover is a Christian who co-wrote a song called &#8220;When You&rsquo;re Holding a Hammer, Everything Looks Like a Nail,&#8221; which takes a dig at the current administration and what he believes to be the wrong moves for the U.S. He sent a link to his song to everyone in his personal e-mail inbox, which included parents from Grassland Middle School [Tennessee], where he coached football.</p>
<p>&#8220;An hour-and-a-half after sending out the e-mail, I got the phone call from the head coach saying that he had had complaints from parents; he was told to fire me,&#8221; the former coach accounts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When the coach first called me, he said his phone was blown up with parents saying that I was being politically incorrect  &mdash;  quote, unquote  &mdash;  if you will, and that some of them were even reading into racial overtones in the song,&#8221; Glover explains.</p>
<p>But he points out that the lyrics make no direct or indirect reference to race.</p>
<p>A number of supportive parents met with the principal and asked for reinstatement, but the school district is remaining firm. The Williamson County superintendent refuses to say why the coach was fired, but he speculates that it could be an issue of how he obtained the parents&rsquo; e-mail addresses  &mdash;  even though the e-mail was sent from his personal account.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>He should seriously consider suing the parents for slander.</p>
<p>Imagine if you will, the effects on political correctness, if he won million dollars judgments from each of the parents who slandered his good name by insisting what he did was something he should be fired over.</p>
<p>Sure&hellip;.he could sue the school for improper termination, win, and enjoy a rich payoff.  And that might influence a few schools who want to balance pressure from politically incorrect fascists and those who are willing to fight back.  But does that solve the problem?  Does it punish the real culprits?</p>
<p>What these people did, BOTH the school district AND the parents, was illegal&hellip;..especially in a public sector job.  You must have cause to fire someone.  These parents said openly, that there was cause (when there isn&rsquo;t&hellip;&hellip;this man has free speech).  This destruction of his reputation caused economic harm.  This situation creates a tort&hellip;.one that is difficult to defend against.  In other words, it will be settled but for a large amount of money.</p>
<p>How many liberals will be willing to do this knowing that there are consequences?</p>

		<p>If he had played this song at school I&rsquo;d be inclined to agree with the parents. After all, I&rsquo;m sure we all remember the teacher who had the students performing &#8220;mmm mmm mmm, Barka hussein obama.&#8221; </p>

<p>But this one is a bit of a gray area. On the one hand, the email was sent from a private computer and email account. On the other hand, there are questions about how the email addresses were obtained. I think I&rsquo;d consult a lawyer and consider a lawsuit. If for no other reason than to help push back the liberal slant in the schools. </p>
<p>I wonder if there is more to this story, such as personal problems between the coach or the superintendent being a radical leftist? I mean, does anyone even have to ask who the super voted for?</p>

<p>He refuses to give the real reason, but he&rsquo;s free to speculate? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it has nothing to do with the fact that the great god Obama, figurehead of the blissful new era in race relations, was actually criticized.</p>
<p>I suppose it will just be a matter of time before Internet sleuths uncover dozens of instances in which Obama&rsquo;s predecessor was insulted, parodied or ridiculed in a mass email with no negative repercussions whatsoever.</p>

		<p>Well, if it were a song praising Obama all the Fox News types would be howling, so you can&rsquo;t have it both ways. It&rsquo;s ridiculous that we live in such &#8220;sensitive&#8221; times, but anymore, the hyper-sensitivity cuts both ways.  </p>

		<p>He was fired because of pressure from anti-white racists.  Even if you hold that his speech-crime was to speak in a way unflattering to the president, know that such signs of resistance are intolerable to the left because they signal resistance to anti-white policies.  </p>
<p>Anti-Bush speech has been darned near mandatory for school teachers for the last ten years.   </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been having government-sponsored &#8220;Death-to America&#8221; chanting at the mosques in Iran ever since the religious movement took over and attacked our embassy as their first international act.  Our president certainly has &#8220;approached&#8221; the Iranian Theocracy more than his predecessors:  by doing all he can to answer their prayers. </p>

		<p>Somebody correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but I don&rsquo;t believe anybody was ever fired for criticizing George W. Bush.  On the other hand, any critic of our current Dear Leader is immediately suspected of racism and is at risk of being fired.<br>

<p>We fought it so Uncle Joe Stalin could create an empire spanning the globe with his rich friends who funded the entire Bolshevik experiment. Obviously, freedom has become extinct worldwide, so it can&rsquo;t be about that.</p>

<p><br>
No reference whatsoever, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  It&rsquo;s considered &#8220;racist&#8221; to criticize a black in power until they&rsquo;ve used up their hundreds of &#8220;second chances&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Just look at the last few days of posts on this website - blacks running huge government agencies or non-profits can&rsquo;t be criticized until they have a 3 page rap sheet.  Then, when it&rsquo;s finally socially acceptable to talk about it, the criminal allegations pour out like a raging river!  The damn breaks, and then the press can finally mention dozens of scandals caused by the black boss over a course of YEARS. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s strange; in my school teachers can say just about whatever they want, in fact my new history teaher criticized Obama just this morning for flip-flopping his posiitons and saying stupuid things all the time. I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of being taught by a number of other teachers - real teachers - who have also critisized Obama, Democrats, liberals, and of course the other side as well.</p>

<p>True, but nobody was fired during the Bush Administration for criticizing him or saying the most despicable things about him from the supposed tolerant and open-minded liberal types.</p>
