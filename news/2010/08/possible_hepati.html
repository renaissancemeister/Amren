<h1><a href="https://www.digtriad.com/news/local/article.aspx?storyid=146661&amp;catid=57">Possible Hepatitis A Transmission in Siler City</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt McKinney, WFMY-TV (Greensboro, North Carolina), August 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Chatham County Health Department is urging customers of a Siler City Burger King to get immunized for possible Hepatitis A.</p>
<p>Health Director Holly Coleman says that anyone who ate food at the Burger King on East 11th Street on August 2 and 3 from 6pm to closing may be at risk for developing Hepatitis A.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS OF HEPATITIS A</p>
<p>The early signs and symptoms of Hepatitis A appear 2-6 weeks after exposure and commonly include mild fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness, pain in the upper right side of the abdomen, dark urine, light color stools and jaundice (yellowness of eyes or skin).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hepatitis A virus is usually spread when a person ingests fecal matter  &mdash;  even in microscopic amounts  &mdash;  from contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated by feces or stool of an infected person. Persons are at increased risk of acquiring Hepatitis A when they have been in close and continuous contact with an infected individual, particularly in a household or day care setting. Fecal matter can remain on the hands unless hands are washed often and thoroughly.</p>
<p>Careful handwashing is key to preventing spread of Hepatitis A and should include vigorous washing of hands with soap and running water for minimum of 20 seconds. All surfaces should be washed including the back of the hands, wrists, between fingers and under fingernails.</p>

		<p>My guess: the employees are of &#8220;Mexican origin&#8221; and did not wash their hands before going back to work. I&rsquo;ve heard stories of people that eat from those lunch cars or mobile &#8220;taquerias&#8221; only to contract some kind of stomach bug.</p>

		<p>I always look to see who is cooking.  If they are from the Groups we cant mention, then I leave.  It takes time, its inconvenient, but at least you will have your health&hellip;and not whats under their finger nails.  Remember, Diversity Is Our Strength.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t trust this government to warn us about anything.</p>
<p>About 10 years ago, a very sharp school nurse told me that in LA many health professionals have quit eating in restaurants/fast food joints because of the high risk of contracting Hep A. You&rsquo;d be very hard pressed to find any food establishment in Los Angeles, including high-end restaurants, where mestizos aren&rsquo;t preparing, cooking and serving food.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen them in in kitchens from Thai, Japanese and Chinese restaurants to pizza-by-the slice outfits.  They are everywhere.  Everywhere.</p>
<p>After watching a few episodes of &#8216;Monsters Inside Me&rsquo; my family has sworn off sushi and/or any type of raw salads unless made in our home.  DH BBQ&rsquo;d some pork last night and almost burned it into inedible leather after watching the episode on trichinosis  &mdash;  and even then he checked the meat repeatedly for any undercooked, pink areas and kept asking me if it were done enough.  I ended up secretly giving  my portion to the dogs  &mdash;  and even they soundly rejected what had been an expensive cut of meat, now unrecognizable as such. </p>
<p>This same nurse told me that all of her fellow nurses had received the Hep A vaccine and recommended it for anyone who dines out in the LA area, and that if I wanted it, she would write the mandated &#8216;note&rsquo; that one needed at the time to get the vaccine.  </p>
<p>I never did get that shot and have rejected the Hep B series of shots as well that my district was trying to force on everyone a few years ago.  I figure my chances of contracting Hep B are approximately zero.</p>
<p>Which leaves me this this:  Which is worse, Hep A or a &#8216;vaccine&rsquo; that is possibly contaminated with mercury and/or other unknown substances from an unregulated lab in China?  </p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll eat at home from now on&hellip;..</p>

		<p>A close friend&rsquo;s father recently died from Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome.  It can be caused by a virus.  It was a terrible, slow death for him, during which time he couldn&rsquo;t speak or move.  I strongly suspect he got it from the mestizos who have invaded the town in which he lived.  As a direct result of his death, I almost never eat out any more, and I NEVER eat fast food anymore.  Anyone who saw what happened to him would never take a chance with their health ever again.</p>

		<p>If you wouldn&rsquo;t eat your meal from a public rest room floor, you shouldn&rsquo;t eat at ethnic restaurants or fast food joints.</p>

<p>Overseas government contractors also get LOTS of innoculations for everything and our shot cards must be examined frequently for needed updates and if needed, we get them.</p>
