<h1>Police Say It&rsquo;s &#8216;Very Possible&rsquo; Attacks Near Fairgrounds Had Racial Overtones</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Alex, Des Moines Register, August 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Des Moines police are trying to determine what led to a series of attacks outside the Iowa State Fairgrounds over the weekend that included the assault of two police officers.</p>
<p>At least three people were arrested Friday through early Monday morning. Other arrests may occur as officers investigate the incidents, officials said.</p>
<p>There are indications that some of the fights  &mdash;  which appear to involve mostly teenagers and young adults  &mdash;  were racially motivated, police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know if this was juveniles fighting or a group of kids singling out white citizens leaving the fairgrounds,&#8221; Sgt. Lori Lavorato said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s all under investigation, but it&rsquo;s very possible it has racial overtones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials announced last week that they were stepping up security outside the fairgrounds after a series of attacks Aug. 14 that included a pair of stabbings. Investigators are still investigating those assaults and victims intend to pursue charges.</p>
<p>Sgt. David Murillo stated in a report on Friday night, &#8220;On-duty officers at the fairgrounds advise there was a group of 30 to 40 individuals roaming the fairgrounds openly calling it &#8216;beat whitey night.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad, D-Des Moines, who has worked to fight gang-related violence, said he doesn&rsquo;t have enough information to decide if the fights were racially motivated. He said police comments that race was involved could miss other factors, such as nonracial taunting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;We of course need to work on race relations. If anyone says we don&rsquo;t, they are playing games with themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A police report says Schuett [Sgt. Richard Schuett] &#8220;was on the ground fighting with his suspect, and several other females began to attack him.&#8221; Another officer grabbed one of the attackers and tried to make an arrest, but she spun away.</p>
<p>Officers sprayed chemical deterrent and deployed a stun gun while trying to gain control. Two teenage girls were taken into custody for questioning following that incident.</p>
<p>Also Sunday night and early Monday:</p>
<p>* Beth Longen, 25, of Des Moines was at the gas pumps at the QuikTrip store, East 30th Street and University Avenue, taking video of the crowd when she was assaulted about 11:20 p.m., police said. A 17-year-old girl allegedly slapped Longen and threatened her in front of police officers. The teen was one of several taken to police headquarters and later released to parents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Kiera Agee, 18, of Des Moines was charged with disorderly conduct. Police said they told her several times to leave the area. She allegedly responded by swearing at police. She was arrested and was taken to jail.</p>
<p>* Ashley Robinson, 18, of Des Moines was charged with interference with official acts. Police said they were doing paperwork in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant near the fairgrounds when Robinson walked up demanding answers to questions. Police were holding several suspects there at the time. She was ordered to leave the area. When she refused, she was taken into custody.</p>

		<p>So the article specifically mentions &#8220;beat whitey night&#8221; and this same article then says, &#8220;it&rsquo;s very possible it has racial overtones&#8221;.   Huh?!</p>
<p>There is nothing more hysterical than a newspaper trying to explain ANYTHING to do with race, no matter how obvious. </p>

		<p>Philadelphia, Seattle, St. Louis, and now Des Moines(!).  These cities have all recently had black hoardes explicitly attacking whites/non-blacks, in some cities on multiple occasions.  DC just had a late-night black brawl on the metro and I&rsquo;d bet there were racial undertones there too.</p>
<p>Concealed carry is good and the only way this sort of thing will stop.  Thugs aren&rsquo;t so tough if they can&rsquo;t pick on the defenseless.</p>

		<p>If the races had been reversed there would have been &#8220;no doubt&#8221; that these attacks were motivated by race and it would have made national news.  This is just one more instance where Blacks are once again held to a different (lower) standard then Whites, which just shows that the libtards in charge really don&rsquo;t think well of Blacks.</p>

<p>Translation: feral blacks were attacking Whites.  Had it been the other way around, the Des Moines doughnut brigades would have had no problem discerning &#8220;racial motivations.&#8221; </p>

<p>Even when the avowed motivation of the mob was to &#8220;beat Whitey,&#8221; the flunkies of the controlled governmedia <i>still</i> can&rsquo;t bring themselves to admit the race of the attackers.  They were just raceless &#8220;individuals,&#8221; you see.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;We of course need to work on race relations.</i></p>
<p>Translation: Whitey had better cough up still more concessions to the dark mob.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: if a gang of Whites had declared a &#8220;beat blackie&#8221; night and violently attacked blacks, would the official response have been a tepid &#8220;we of course need to work on race relations?&#8221;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m reading the same article over and over again.  Flash mobs attacking whites in Philadelphia, black teenage mobs attacking whites in Denver, Atlanta, Baltimore, Minnesota (another State Fair if I recall), New York at another local fair, now in Iowa.  It&rsquo;s clear to me that blacks are targeting whites in public places like malls and outdoor public festivals.  Can you imagine this type of behavior being tolerated before the media and police departments were taken over by leftist white hating goons.  The media flat out ignores any form of black aggression against whites and inflates perceived &#8220;racism&#8221; against blacks to mountainous heights.  </p>
<p>Are black agitators sending out teenage black mobs to rampage and attack whites to test the response of police just as they did at that black church in Indianapolis?  Are blacks now starting to realize that all the promises the race hustlers made about Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency were lies or does the fact that there is a hostile black regime ruling us empower them to rampage like animals knowing that the media and justice department will protect them?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enraging to me that white families cannot enjoy the simple pleasure of being in a public park or fair without being targeted by black punks with a wink and a nod from the complicit liberal media.  White people need to decide right now if this is the kind of country they want to live in.  </p>

We&rsquo;ve gone from an automatic denial of a race-based crime to &#8220;very possible&#8221;. It seems both the police and the press are having an increasingly difficult time denying what everyone sees as the truth.</p>

<p>With a name like that, he is a muslim and probably black but racial or not, if it was a muslim being attacked I bet he would be crying racial bias, especially if the attackers were white Christian..and I believe that is coming soon. WHY on earth would the people of White bread Iowa elect a damn muslim to the senate anyway? no possible good will come of that.</p>

		<p>According to the 2000 census,  blacks constitute only 8% of Des Moines&rsquo; population, yet they are absolutely fearless and brazen in confronting the cops or any other authority. And these are young blacks   &mdash;   teenagers.  Talk about arrogance! They see how the authorities grovel to them, and they EXPECT this. They take it for granted.  We don&rsquo;t have to wait until they are the majority to see the writing on the wall.</p>

		<p>This sure doesn&rsquo;t appear to be anything like the River City of &#8220;The Music Man.&#8221; What a different world that was, as the United States entered the 20th century and no one questioned that this country was a civilization with strong European roots going back to the Colonial period.</p>
<p>Now young people of European descent in the United States have models like Eminem, a total Whigger if there ever was one. He portrays some kind of post-racial world, in which whites and blacks happily rap their life away.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the real reality of racial relationships, and why young whites need to regain their past and their racial solidarity, is found in these group attacks by gangs of blacks on whites, who without a sense of group identity that has mostly been &#8220;deracinated&#8221; from them are &#8220;sitting ducks&#8221; for the kind of violence that recently went on at the Des Moines Fairgrounds.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not jump to conclusions about this being a racially motivated attack.  I believe what my media masters tell me to believe.  When this makes the top story on CNN, or 60 Minutes does an expose, then of course I&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s true.  Until then I&rsquo;ll be blissfully watching the baseball game.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Beat Whitey&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t happen if Whites practiced a few things: (1) Travel in large groups including trips to the bathroom (2) Don&rsquo;t drink in public or let your guard down around strangers (3) Carry large caliber handguns e.g. 10mm, .357 Magnum, etc., and be trained how to use them.</p>

		<p>Sadly, this sort of thing is becoming all too common an occurrence.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, when latinos are assaulting blacks, the blacks complain that whitey doesn&rsquo;t protect them (see violence against blacks in LA).  When blacks attack latinos then they come to us and say protect us from the blacks.  Ditto with Asian assault victims.</p>
<p>When whites are assaulted by non-whites, everyone says, &#8220;Well, I don&rsquo;t know if that was racially motivated or not&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>As Race Realists, we of the AmRen Community enjoys White Humanity&rsquo;s accumulated hard won wisdom over centuries of generations of righteous mate selection by all our White Ancestors.  Our Race Realism is the wealth of our Race Nation.</p>
<p>We understand the word &#8220;prejudgment&#8221; better than any other.  Our thinking is our holy genetic expression.  Our White Duty is to share with our White Brothers and Sisters in Iowa that these attacks justify all their prejudgments, prejudices, and even racism, which is nothing more that God&rsquo;s Survival Command in action. </p>
<p>Spread the wealth of our treasured White insights-</p>
<p>http://www.vdare.com/buchanan/100823_only_bigots.htm</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>Prejudice is prejudgment. And if prejudgment is rooted in the history and traditions of a people, and what life has taught us, it is a shield that protects. Only a fool would reject the inherited wisdom of his kind because it fails to comport with the ideology of the moment.</p>
<p><br>
snip</p>
<p>It is this idea of prejudice that Edmund Burke endorsed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it most wise to continue the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice, and to leave nothing but the naked reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>&#8220;Prejudice,&#8221; wrote Burke, &#8220;is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled and unresolved.&#8221;</p>
<p>end snips</p>

		<p>It reached the point long ago that I just stopped going to most public places because of black &amp; brown misbehavior. There are a few locales, such as live theater and of course the beach (in the water, anyway) where one is extremely unlikely to encounter blacks or even many browns, but movie theaters, fairgrounds, fast food restaurants, public basketball courts, housing areas with Section 8 residents&hellip; forget it.</p>
<p>How  &mdash;  or more to the point why  &mdash;  do people put up with it? I only have two modes, with no middle ground: (1) Avoidance and (2) massive, aggressive, no-holds-barred retaliation. The latter just gets you into trouble when dealing with these protected species, but how long will avoidance work before we just can&rsquo;t go ANYWHERE?!</p>

		<p>I witnessed a race attack today.</p>
<p>Was sitting in a restaurant and in comes a coal black african american moving very jauntily past the tables.  He sat down with a White girl (in color only) who started holding his coal black african hands, kissing them, and then rubbing her White hands all over his coal black african face.</p>
<p>I was utterly disgusted.  Not at her for publicly acting out the degenerated perversion that she was, but for all the other White girls in the room who didn&rsquo;t even look twice or seem to notice that something horrid, vile, repugnant, and dangerous was happening just a few feet away from them.  White girls as so accustomed to seeing White women on TV making out with the blacks that they don&rsquo;t even flinch!</p>
<p>God, I really do hate White Girls.  They are the curse of our race!</p>
<p>I then walked by the offending White girl and looked at her eyes- they were beautiful Irish eyes of multihued blue- and they were staring all lovey dovey right into that coal black african american face.</p>
<p>Now I understand the legitimacy of &#8220;beat whitey night&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is no horror which we don&rsquo;t deserve for our allowing our White women to be utterly destroyed by the Diversity Curse.</p>
<p>Go ahead God, please mongrelize us out of existence. We don&rsquo;t deserve anything better.</p>

		<p>  Like it or not, admit it or not; we are in a race war. Whites have been singled out for extermination. Our government is aiding non-whites in carrying out this attack against us. They use our tax money to wage a war against us, including liberal whites whom will commit suicide in order to appease our enemies. How much more will white men take before we strike out against our attackers? How much more loss before we make a stand?</p>

<p>A group of Black people purposely seek White people to violently assault and announce that during the assaults but it is not certain whether or not the attacks were racial in nature?  Meanwhile any time that a White person does anything that even offends a Black person, even if inadvertantly, it is always a racist hate crime by those evil White monsters.</p>
<p>&#8220;He added, &ldquo;We of course need to work on race relations. If anyone says we don&rsquo;t, they are playing games with themselves.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Whoa, what&rsquo;s this all about?  I thought &#8220;diversity is a strength&#8221;, so how can it possibly be that race relations need to be worked on?  What with diversity being a strength and all it should be natural!  Or is this an admission of what the people of Amren have been saying all along: That diversity leads to tension, conflict, and even violence.</p>

		<p>Black racial hostility is growing and has for decades.  The internet is fueling it like nothing else and you are seeing it with these large black gatherings at white places to at least cause disruption and at most start violence.  A black internet radio show called atraael on UStream has repeatedly put out the idea of a day to punch white people.</p>
<p>Slavery is over yet black people are still here.  This is what happens when white businessmen and white politicians put greed ahead of everything else.  The rest of us will have to deal with the upheaval non-white races bring to white places.  The Michigan State Fair, the longest running in the country, just decided to end no doubt because as more and more black people attended the fair the atmosphere turned hostile to the point where white people and white vendors who created and sustained the fair didn&rsquo;t even want to go.  White people create highly attractive and pleasant places to live which no other race can duplicate.  A survey released several months ago showed even Japanese people want to leave Japan which has the second largest economy in the world and a very high standard of living to go to white places.</p>

		<p>State Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad, D-Des Moines,-</p>
<p>How in the world did someone by the name of Ako Abdul-Samad get to be a state rep. in IOWA, or even get INTO Iowa to begin with?? I&rsquo;m beginning to have serious doughts about the Whites in Iowa. I believe it was De Moines that years ago ADVERTISED in Chicago for blacks to come live there. Then a large majority of them voted the muslim into the White House. As the &#8220;rev.&#8221; Wright said - &#8220;the chickens have come home to &#8216;roose&rsquo;&#8221;. I also feel the same about my fellow Whites as he does about his fellow blacks - I&rsquo;m sick of Caucasians who just don&rsquo;t get it!    </p>

		<p> So it&rsquo;s &#8220;possible&#8221; that the attacks &#8220;may have been racially motivated,&#8221; huh? What would it take to convince some of these doubting thomases? Surveillance videos proving black thuggism beyond the shadow of a doubt?</p>
<p> And it&rsquo;s obvious that the Des Moines police have been far too gentle with people like this in the past. When the thug element of the public walks up to police officers bold as brass and gives them a cussing, and even assaults them, then you know a certain respect that used to be enforced by the nightstick and a willingness to use it, has departed our politically correct society.</p>

		<p>As an older white woman living alone in south Florida I am subjected to Black and Hispanic racial hatred all the time (hence the moniker). From criminal-5 armed robbery attempts-all by blacks-all thwarted because I am a licensed gun owner and carry it, to verbal, almost every day. Unfortunately, the couple of times I called my local police dept. for help(surrounded by black males on skateboards hollering threats, etc.)they asked if it was an emergency and when I said no, but described the problem, I was told they were too busy to send someone. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN! Next time I think I&rsquo;ll tell them the emergency will be when I put a bullet in one of their cowardly black heads. Watch how fast they&rsquo;ll respond then!     </p>

		<p>Well stated Eric#8. We need to demand hearings on organized beatings of whites by blacks.This is clearly a civil rights case if there ever was one. I would not be surprised if the new GOP congress would hold hearings if pressured intensely by FOX or Rush.Simple neighborhood walks are a thing of the past due to blacks. This is an untenable situation and blacks deserve whatever re-segregation that ensues in the coming decades.Because mine eyes can see they are not like us at all.</p>

		<p>I think most whites are getting really fed up with this criminal, uncivilized, primitive behavior. It seems, however, that many whites feel they are powerless to stop this degradation of America. The slippery slope of LBJ and the crazed, suicidal white liberals that followed has gotten too steep. Whites have no where to turn and no one to turn to. </p>
<p>I blame the media for much of the problem - from selective reporting to political bias to a leftist mindset bent on brainwashing the white audience. For example, if more whites knew about AmRen that would be a start for raising white consciousness but the mainstream media falsely portrays AmRen, (and similar sites) in the most heinous ways - labeling it a hate site and throwing in, for good measure, anti-semitism and images of Nazi stormtroopers and anything else designed to provoke fear.</p>
<p>In the end, in the final analysis, I believe whites will take back the country from the destructive path it is on. I&rsquo;m not sure what the cost will be but the longer we wait the more expensive it will become.</p>
<p>For now, in instances like the horror in Des Moines, I think whites should bring civil suits against every black involved and ask for restitution and monetary damages. Every time. Blacks are too disorganized and intellectually challenged to handle a barrage of lawsuits. This will raise white consciousness in the media and send a message. If justice cannot be delivered in the corrupt and useless criminal courts let&rsquo;s see how it plays out in civil court.</p>
<p>Will any money be obtained? Probably not, but that&rsquo;s not the point. Every black/black family involved in these hate-crimes will have judgments hanging over their heads (and paychecks) and believe me, word will spread. It also shows other whites that this behavior is NOT ACCEPTABLE and fighting back, if at first through the courts, does not make one a racist.</p>
<p>Of course, liberal white lawyers would probably defend these criminals initially but after a time they would be disgusted wasting time and money on these animals - money that had been previously set aside for anti-white activity or their own greddy pockets.</p>
<p>Anyway, just a thought&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;There are indications that some of the fights were racially motivated&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What idiot believes these brutal assaults were NOT racially motivated?</p>
<p>These attacks do not surprise me, and they will escalate in frequency and intensity as the empire continues to crumble.</p>
<p>This is the result from decades of blacks being steeped in a  White-hating culture promoted by  K-12 government schools and media; of blacks told from birth that Whites are the cause of their poverty, violence and failure.</p>
<p>Your White life means nothing to this regime:  &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if this was juveniles fighting or a group of kids singling out white citizens.&#8221; Sgt. Lori Lavorato said.</p>
<p>Who do the media deign to interview?  White advocates screaming about Whites being racially targeted and brutally attacked?  White ministers demanding answers from the government and redress, including large monetary payments for the White victims?  White citizens marching, insisting the government/ FBI/DOJ investigate &#8216;beat Whitey night&rsquo; and protect them from violent blacks?&rsquo;  White politicians demanding harsh punishments with hate crime enhancement for the black thugs?</p>
<p>No, the media chose to interview a non-White, Ako Abdul-Samad who claims:  &#8220;police comments that race was involved could miss other factors, such as nonracial taunting.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the media and government, this case is closed and all charges will be dropped and forgotten.  After all, it&rsquo;s only about blacks assaulting worthless Whites so who cares?</p>
<p>Are you starting to get a sense of your White value to the media, the police, the politicians, the DOJ and the government?  To them you are a worthless Kulak, good only for any wealth they can steal from you via punitive taxation.</p>
<p>As no government entity will protect us or provide redress for us from brutal racial assaults, the ONLY answer is to be ever vigilant and prepared around blacks.  We Whites must send blacks a strong message that if they target us for assault, robbery and murder, they will be subjected to immediate, brutal, retaliation administered with all prejudice.  </p>
<p>And then do it.</p>

		<p>The sad fact is that this story will fade into nothingness just like all the other black beats,robs, rapes, kills whitey stories. You see these stories at least once a week, then poof they are gone.</p>
<p>  Compare the public policy changes that were justified by the brutal murders of Eve Carson and Channon Christian and Anne Pressley to the public policy changes that we got.  </p>
<p>What difference does our  mortality rate of White Girls really make to Affirmative Action, the Diversity Curse, Multicultural Missions,  and Inclusive Tolerance quotas? </p>
<p></p>
<p>NOTHING, and you know it! </p>
<p>How many college boards and corporate boards just threw up their hands and gave up on Diversity? Isn&rsquo;t there enough black pathology surrounding everybody to justify giving up all the unearned preferential treatment, especially after all we&rsquo;ve done for them and all the cost we&rsquo;ve incurred?  If they aren&rsquo;t better by now, then time&rsquo;s up!   </p>
<p>But no, it&rsquo;s not- we must keep &#8220;doing more to atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges, and White girls need to stop being racist and prove they embrace Diversity by starting to date blacks and be da baby mommas to the future hopes of our gobal nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>White people have vast capacity for enduring degradation at the hands of their inferiors. Some blame it on Christianity, others on the Jews, and still others on the fatigue of modern life having incapacitated us to fight back.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter the cause.  We live under a tyranny that punishes us beyond our ability to withstand losing our opportunities, careers, homes, and families. Whites  just can&rsquo;t afford being called raciss, so we cower.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop blaming ourselves and start blaming the White politicians.</p>
<p> We must find effective and enduring means of holding them accountable.  Tea Parties and Town Halls may be a start.  Once you see those organized on pure and explicit White Identity and White Interest, then you can take hope that the politicians will start to grovel before us instead of before minorities. We have more votes, which we waste. A vote should be considered a weapon in the race war.</p>
<p>The solution: White Voting Bloc- conscious, organized, and very angry.</p>
<p>Do what our victors did to us- but do it bigger and better!</p>
<p><br>
I pledge to never vote for a candidate who does not explicitly say what he will do for my White Community.  Join me.  At the next campaign rally, just ask, &#8220;What will you do for the White Community.&#8221;  If he waffles, shout him down as a race traitor and have an alternative candidate to promote.</p>
<p>We are in a war, and we must fight like it.</p>

<p>Cuss on Ayn Rand. Good story, good critique of our enemies, but wrong solution.  We can&rsquo;t fight against the Communities of Color as hard, successful, achieving White Individuals. White Individuals compete too much against other the White Individuals.  </p>
<p>We need White Communities fighting FOR White Individuals within them. We need White Liberty from non white tyranny.</p>
<p>We can get it, too.  Just wait till the American White Middle Class becomes convinced that nothing will ever get better for them.

		<p>Iowa is overwhelmingly white in terms of its population, but many of the liberal residents feel guilty and have sought to cultivate minorities. Several years ago, the leaders of Dubuque actually sought to encourage minorities to relocate to their city in order to diversify the local population. What an absolute joke that turned out to be!</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Iowa helped launch the hoax that is now known as the Obama presidency in its caucuses, which have notoriously lax standards for voter participation that Obama and his Chicago thugs were able to drive busloads full of non-residents through, by allowing many unregistered persons to take part in the caucus meetings. </p>

Blacks will carry guns regardless of the law, these laws were designed to protect us from blacks&hellip;.period.  If you present blacks with anything other than aggression or hostility they will perceive it as weakness. The only thing the American black man respects is violence and a willingless to use it.

This isn&rsquo;t even close to being true.  It&rsquo;s actually a media manipulation&hellip;.part of the conspiracy of silence about what is going on and the use of the term &#8220;crime&#8221; when what is actually going on is war.</p>
<p>The most common cause of death for young black males is being shot during a &#8220;crime&#8221;.  However, the CDC (which tracks this stat) refuses to separate out exactly how these shootings take place.  Is the black a victim of crime?  Is he shot in self-defense.  Is he shot in self-defense by a black person or a white person.</p>
<p>Although there are no stats, based on the simple fact that gun and self-defense laws are being reformed in state after state, jurisdiction after jurisdiction, I feel comfortable in answering this question.</p>
<p>The most common cause of death for young black men is being shot by a white person in self defense during the commission of a crime.  The issue is so important and intense that literally, the US is separating out into two types of places&hellip;&hellip;ones where blacks feel safe victimizing whites and ones where they are not safe victimizing whites (whether they know it or not).  Blacks are increasingly concentrated in the former.</p>
<p>It is only a matter of time before the pretense is dropped.  I&rsquo;ll even tell you when you know it is about to happen&hellip;..when the welfare runs out.</p>

		<p>For those expressing confusion over the presence of a black Muslim in Iowa, Iowa&rsquo;s not as white as people perceive it to be. There have been large influxes of people from Chicago and other urban areas ever since the Vilsack days, when he made &#8220;population growth&#8221; a important priority. I live in Eastern Iowa, and there&rsquo;s various imported black/Latino neighborhoods. This is unfortunately a time bomb waiting to happen. </p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t have much faith in whites fighting back, at least in Iowa. White Iowans are among the most racially tolerant whites in the entire US. Interracial dating is fairly common, and white Iowans are largely welcoming towards black and Latino newcomers. And never doubt the powers of white mental ju-jitsu when it comes to denying racial issues. ;)</p>

<p>What further upsets me is the passive response of the whites.  Don&rsquo;t any fight back?  Are we now so helpless?  After years of brainwashing by schools and media, have we been so disarmed, both physically and emotionally, that we are just waiting helplessly to become passive victims?  </p>
<p>As Paul Jones put it, the need for  &#8220;young whites to regain their past and their racial solidarity is illustrated in these group attacks by gangs of blacks on  <b>whites, who without a sense of group identity that has mostly been &ldquo;deracinated&rdquo; from them are merely &ldquo;sitting ducks&rdquo;.</b><br>
 <br>
Indeed. Iowa is one of the whitest states in the country. Its black population is only 2.8%  [this is up from 1.4% just 20 years earlier, a 100% increase]. Blacks are still only a small percentage in a city like Des Moines. Even without support of the public safety authorities, there is no reason why a large majority of the population should allow itself to be attacked and intimidated by a small, aggressive minority. In former times, behavior like this would not have been tolerated by the public, and within 24 hours the black ghetto would be a charred and smoldering ruin.</p>
<p>Oh, and I almost forgot: State Representative &#8220;Aku Abdul-Samad&#8221; is indeed a Moslem and as black as they come. (Thank you, Skip.)   How did someone like that get elected to represent an overwhelmingly white Christian state like Iowa?   Only MASSIVE media brainwashing could have accomplished this feat, convincing all those innocent, well meaning Iowans that &#8220;race is nothing more than a social construct&#8221;.  http://tinyurl.com/2epq9k6</p>
<p>And doubtless convincing them of their need to atone for the burden of all that &#8220;White Guilt&#8221; and &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; that they carry.  </p>
<p>(Let&rsquo;s remember that Iowa is the home state of the guilt-obsessed, anti-white fanatic Jane Elliott   &mdash;   where she lives in a town that is all white.  I wonder how she&rsquo;d explain these attacks?  No doubt these angry black teenagers are just acting out their justifiable rage and frustration at being held down and persecuted for all the many years of their entire lives.)</p>

A firestorm of outrage amongst blacks will be whipped up by the white liberal media. This is when all hell will break loose. Every major urban area in the US will have riots similar or worse than Los Angeles after the Rodney King case. Black racial violence against non-blacks, like the events in Iowa, happen everyday in every urban area in the US. This violence is routine.

		<p>My husband, who watches news and political talk shows all day, says he&rsquo;s heard nary a word about this incident.  Of course, no one reading this is one bit surprised.  <br>
Some foolish, naive souls believed that Obama&rsquo;s election would mollify blacks, and then there were those of us who figured it would only embolden the worst of them  &mdash;  which it apparently has.  It reminds me of what I read about the situation in the South following emancipation.  I believe that now things are beginning to come to a head, just as they did then.  Whites are still the majority, and most of us are not fuzzy-headed liberals living in ivory towers.  And how long are businesses going to tolerate losing money because whites will no longer attend functions because of black violence?<br>
As to the election of the black Moslem in Iowa: this guy is merely a state rep.  He probably was elected from a mostly black, possibly gerrymandered district.  </p>

		<p>These pack attacks have been happening all over the country. They&rsquo;re identical to the mass attacks on white farms in Zimbabwe, but on a smaller, less deadly scale. So far, blacks in the US are just attacking whites for their own entertainment, but their use of social networking technology to organize some of these attacks is a very bad sign.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using communications to organize flash mobs. This is no different in principle from using communications to organize a small army. So far, the attacks have been random and generally limited to beatings and the like, but that&rsquo;s only temporary. I predict that we&rsquo;ll be seeing &#8220;beat whitey&#8221; attacks escalate to &#8220;kill whitey&#8221; attacks in the near future.</p>
<p>The poster who recommended that whites travel in large groups, never let their guard down around strangers and carry large caliber handguns was describing a state of lawlessness and general social breakdown that hasn&rsquo;t been seen in the West since the Middle Ages. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s coming, I&rsquo;m afraid. I can see a time coming when white enclaves will have to surround their communities with palisades, ditches and stone fortifications that can stand up to extended sieges.</p>

It seems that either way, we can&rsquo;t win. There&rsquo;s going to be trouble ahead. The only thing as bad as an Obama victory will be an Obama defeat.  It&rsquo;ll be hell either way.

		<p>Here is some information on Iowa&rsquo;s Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad.</p>
<p>Nothing much though!  Neither in Wikipedia nor any of the other biographical material, can I find anything about his background   &mdash;    other than that he is A) a male, and B)a Muslim. Nothing else!</p>
<p>Nothing about his birthplace, birth date, where he grew up, education, or anything prior to 2006, when he was elected to office. His background is a mystery, a blank!  Very strange, no?  How did a secretive unknown like this get elected at all to an important government office? </p>
<p>Oh, and I do notice that on his homepage, he has an unidentified flag flying, in Arabic, ABOVE the US stars and stripes!</p>
<p><br>
All the more amazing to think that this person came from out of nowhere and was elected in 2006, just 5 years after the horrors of 9/11.</p>
<p>Well, just like Obama came from out of nowhere, when you stop to think of it.  Both of them unknowns, both of them non-white, both of them Moslems.</p>

		<p>The next time an anti-racist babbles on about how &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; and &#8220;white privilege&#8221; still exists in this country, be sure to point to these types of incidents in Iowa, Maine, Minneapolis, Seattle, Denver, Baltimore, Florida, Atlanta, St. Louis, Akron, and on and on. Keep in mind that for every one of these incidents that actually get media coverage, there are likely 10 or 20 on a smaller level that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If the general white population is slowly being intimidated into not going to certain public spaces for fear of being physically attacked, then what does that translate into nationwide? If certain parts of town, at certain times of the day or year are unsafe for white people isn&rsquo;t THIS a form of pervasive, system-wide racism that&rsquo;s every bit as pernicious as the &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; of &#8220;white privilege?&#8221; Isn&rsquo;t it even worse? When was the last time you heard of organized groups of white people going on rampages assaulting non-whites? </p>
<p>It should anger the h*ll out of us that we and our kids are slowly being &#8220;taught&#8221; that there are public places we can&rsquo;t go, that there are times it is not safe for us to be out in public, because of our skin color. It is no exaggeration to say that white people in this country are SYSTEMATICALLY the targets, the victims of interracial crime - as the wounds of fair-goers in Iowa prove. This &#8220;system&#8221; may be more of a culture of hatred against white people, it may not have official sanction, but it exists nonetheless and it is widespread. And the way the media talks about this phenomenon definitely implies a certain amount of &#8220;systemic complicity.&#8221; This is low level anti-white terror. And what evidence is there to suggest that we should expect less of this terror, rather than more?</p>
<p>In short, the next time you hear some fool mouthing off about &#8220;white privilege&#8221; ask them where was that privilege in Iowa (Denver, Baltimore, Akron, etc)?</p>

&#8220;God, I really do hate White Girls. They are the curse of our race!</p>

<p>Go ahead God, please mongrelize us out of existence. We don&rsquo;t deserve anything better. </p>
<p>&hellip; [#19, Shocked &amp; Disappointed]</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Your post is very regrettable, and I deplore it! The incident you witnessed could have elicited various responses, not just your gloomy, self-hating one. </p>
<p>I do not find your negativity to be wholesome or useful. If you feel that our cause is hopeless and we are doomed, then why do you even bother to post something like this here? Why go to the trouble? Such nonsense as this is not constructive, and we don&rsquo;t need it. </p>
<p>Sowing hatred against beautiful white girls (because of the behavior of one) is especially non-productive. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more to this.</p>
<p>PS: What did your own girlfriend have to say about this? Oh, you didn&rsquo;t have one? It&rsquo;s evident that you have problems with women  &mdash;  which are not related to race.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
GHW - I agree that the poster #19 ought to think things out a bit more.  However, when he does, and if you did, I predict that you would both find Feminism, and therefore many white women to blame for the state of things from miscegenation increases to the blame whitey game.  These are women like Obama&rsquo;s mother, who bored with her life and rebellious against her parents showed&rsquo;em by taking up with a Kenyan who beat her and left her for another white woman, but gave us not a foreign born, but a foreign raised President.  Early Feminists were pointedly on board with the Civil Rights Movement in general, riding on its coattails well into the &rsquo;70s, employing all and any strategy, regardless of ethics while demanding fairness, shame, recompense from men, especially white men.  Read former NOW executive Tammy Bruce&rsquo;s &#8220;The New Thought Police,&#8221; and some of her other books.  The white girl poster #19 saw was merely imitating behaviors that have long been the mark of a &#8220;liberated white woman,&#8221; giving her finger to all who might see her, hence the public exhibition.</p>
<p><br>
While it is true that many young women today are relatively unthinking products rather than actual agents, that does not mean the problem is resolving.  To the contrary, it means that the brainwashing Feminism has worked on has worked.  One famous late evidence is actress Jennifer Anniston who recently declared that she is going to be a mother via a sperm bank and that children don&rsquo;t need a father.  Since she has money, it doesn&rsquo;t occur to her that she is influencing untold numbers of young women into lives of predictable poverty and misery while they produce the next generation of useless, demented youth.</p>
<p>Like you, I don&rsquo;t hate white women, but I often am made sad by them, when I see them hurting not just the white race, but predictably, even themselves as the far majority of these associations do not turn out well for the white female, often marking them through maternal obligations and/or experiential psychosis.  If only NOW and women would stop and understand what is being done to them, what deception they are being played for, the cost to them and their lives!  But I also think that many white women are beginning to see that blacks are dangerous to them.  So far, they are mostly learning one at a time. <br>

		<p> If you listen to &#8220;police language&#8221;, there are references to &#8220;protected groups&#8221;.I&rsquo;ve never had this explained to a point of complete clarity; but the gist is that certain groups are entitled to more protection, tolerance and leeway than others.</p>
<p> Whites are pretty much at the bottom of police priorities as we are definitely not in this category.  The real problem, as I see it is that at the same time the police will not protect whites with the same vigor; they insist on full prosecution and persecution of whites that dare have the audacity to defend themselves against these &#8220;protected groups&#8221;.</p>
<p> It creates a catch 22 situation, be beaten, robbed, raped and murdered by the &#8220;protected groups&#8221; or be dragged through the legal system, bankrupted and jailed by various police and court systems.</p>
<p> To borrow a phrase from a recurring poster: May God help us all.</p>

<p>#47 wrote:</p>
<p>[Have no fear! I can tell you how it will play out. Certain sympathetic (and wealthy) groups and foundations, will rush to their defense  &mdash;  just as they have always done throughout the entire 20th century.</p>
<p>Do you think blacks have any worry about things like that? They don&rsquo;t even pay their own child support. They just ignore &ldquo;silly stuff&rdquo; like that. Or they go and disappear.</p>
<p>Such groups have been &ldquo;wasting time and money&rdquo; for the past century, and they show no sign of tiring of it.]</p>
<p>=========================================</p>
<p>My point is that we have to start somewhere. All journeys begin with a first step. I think #47 has an attitude that is defeatist and negative. These &#8220;wealthy groups&#8221; may be more vulnerable or tired than you think. Blacks may be even more impacted with civil trials than you can imagine. The resulting publicity can only help.</p>
<p>In any event, what do you propose? I don&rsquo;t hear a plan - just a dismissive rejoinder. It is not possible, at this point, to take matters into our own hands, so to speak. </p>
<p>I think voluntary and planned white relocation to a connected group of states is the ultimate answer, along with other actions, and the civil court idea was one. A few test trials couldn&rsquo;t hurt. it&rsquo;s better than doing nothing.</p>

		<p>Just an observation, but from what I&rsquo;ve witnessed (which is a lot), blacks always run in packs when it comes to their criminal behavior. I went through high school in the 70&rsquo;s and it was always two,three or more blacks jumping one white person. I never saw whites jumping blacks. Talk about racial profiling! They are the most racist group in existence! I lived it first hand. My first year in high school was the first year they put us whites in an all black school. And they are cowards. Which is why I never saw just one lone black person jump a white person.</p>

<p>Disagree. There are plenty of White males at fault here. Marx and Lennon were two such White males, all of these professors at our universities and our open borders politicians, many or most of whom are White males are to blame.

		<p>On reading the above article, it becomes increasingly obvious to me that an exclusive political movement for indigenous European-descended Americans must be set up or at the very least, those already established become aligned and/or amalgamated</p>
<p>Such a movement shall have to be explicit in its ethnic interests too since, for example, in the UK and other European countries, indigenous White organisations are forced to admit non-Whites and whatsmore, permit such aliens to run for office and leadership roles within those White organisations.</p>
<p>It must become enacted policy that non-Whites shall NOT be permitted to join nor run for office and leadership roles in White organisations unless the aforementioned practices are actually seen to be occurring in non-White only organisations and that means <b>all</b> non-White organisations.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I have to admit, secession whether by consent or force, will have to come about sooner or later.</p>
<p>I suspect, the necessary secession will happen through civil war.</p>

		<p>#19, based on history of your posts, I&rsquo;m going to assume that like me at times, you had responded to the article in the throes of a particularly nauseating situation that you recently encountered in that restaurant and are livid. Understandable. However, I&rsquo;m a &#8216;white girl&rsquo;, and hardly fit your view. Your mother is (I&rsquo;m assuming ) a white girl, and any sisters, wife or daughters you have are, as well. It&rsquo;s kind of like I ask the trucker that spews venom at all the &#8220;**** 4-wheelers&#8221; in his way) then gets in his own pick up after his job to drive home, or his wife who drives their kids to ball games: &#8220;What do YOU and your wife drive off the job??&#8221;</p>
<p>Whenever I encounter such a repulsive union of blacks &amp; whites (which is regrettably much too often), I glare at both parties very disgustingly, roll my eyes and shake my head - and it means absolutely nothing to them. The blacks who won&rsquo;t beat the slop out of you for the dirty look will usually just laugh and act superior. The girls act as if you&rsquo;re invisible. These people, (and it&rsquo;s hardly just white GIRLS, aren&rsquo;t the least bit concerned what the rest of us think. But as poster Sonya #59 pointed out, as a white male, what are you doing differently? </p>
<p>After you calm down and get your bearings, don&rsquo;t hate the entire crop of white American girls. Millions of white girls are not race mixers. They&rsquo;re the only hope you&rsquo;ve got. Many young white males are just as trashy; dressing and acting like all the world they wish they were a &#8216;bro.&rsquo; </p>

<p>Probably not since the riots against the Chinese in San Francisco way back when.<br>
Another thing that freaks me out is when Blacks and their self loathing White apologists say that Blacks can&rsquo;t be racist because they have no power. <br>
To me it all depends on one&rsquo;s definition of &#8220;power&#8221;. They&rsquo;ve turned most American cities into Hell holes of fear having transformed large sections of urban areas e.g Philadelphia, Camden, Memphis, Minneapolis, Oakland, Newark NJ, Gary, Brooklyn, Bronx, St. Louis, St. Petersburg, Denver, Chicago, Woonsocket etc. ad infinitum into places where no one dares venture. They&rsquo;ve literally destroyed the Public School system in most of our cities, taken over the public transit system after dark, they&rsquo;ve caused burdensome taxes due to the subsidies to which we their hosts contribute including the maintenance of the prison system, they&rsquo;ve hamstrung the legal/ court system and they&rsquo;ve made this entire country a much more dangerous place. I&rsquo;d say that adds up to a LOT of power.</p>
<p>That is like saying that Attila and the Huns had no power.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that true?  It&rsquo;s always someone else who&rsquo;s in the wrong.<br>
(Why didn&rsquo;t THEY do something about it?)</p>
<p><br>
I have my own policy in public places like that. Since I&rsquo;m not looking for trouble (and who is?), I keep my opinions to my self. </p>
<p>My position is that they didn&rsquo;t ask me for my opinion, so I don&rsquo;t have to give it to them. But I certainly have the right to have one! But it&rsquo;s MY opinion, and it&rsquo;s private.</p>
<p>However, if they were to ask me for the time, or a napkin, or any little thing, they would encounter a very crisp, frosty  attitude.  Yes, we still have a right to have our own attitudes, and no one can call the cops about that.  We don&rsquo;t have to insult anybody, but there is no legal requirment to be FRIENDLY.</p>
