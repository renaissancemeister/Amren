			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rebecca Lefort, London Telegraph, August 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 700 children are born with genetic diseases every year as a result of cousin marriages, an investigation has found.</p>
<p>The problem is worst among children born in Britain&rsquo;s Pakistani community, where more than half of marriages are between first cousins, and children are 10 times more likely than the general population to suffer genetic disorders.</p>
<p>The medical risks of first cousin marriages include higher rates of infant mortality, birth defects, learning difficulties, blindness, hearing problems and metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>As adults, the children born from first cousin marriages are at increased risk of miscarriage or infertility. A third of children affected die before their fifth birthday.</p>
<p>An investigation by Channel 4&rsquo;s Dispatches programme found that although more than 70 British studies have proved the risks, and 700 British Pakistani children are born with associated genetic diseases every year, many people deny the dangers.</p>
<p>Ann Cryer, the former Labour MP for Keighley, suffered abuse for trying to highlight the problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a public health issue and we deal with public health issues by raising awareness, by talking about subjects such as obesity, such as drug addiction, such as alcohol,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But for some reason we&rsquo;re told that we mustn&rsquo;t talk about cousin marriages because this is a sensitive issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s absurd, we have to talk about it in order to find solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Research shows the number of cousin marriages has risen dramatically in the UK over the last three decades, mainly between British Pakistanis, but also between first cousins in the British Bangladeshi community in which nearly a quarter of people marry their first cousins, and in some Middle Eastern and East African communities.<br>

		<p>mainly between British Pakistanis, but also between first cousins in the British Bangladeshi community in which nearly a quarter of people marry their first cousins,</p>
<p>Just for the sake of clarity for those that don&rsquo;t know, there is no difference between a Pakistani or Bangledeshi muslim, only a few miles east to west otherwise, they are EXACTLY the same in their beliefs, hostility and belligerence to the West and most aspire to be cab drivers.</p>

		<p>If the disabled children cannot reproduce, there is something to say in favor of consanguine marriages producing disabled : it contributes to clear the genetic pool of bad alleles. And there is, too, the possibility that consanguine marriages produce exceptionnaly talented persons.<br>
That said, it is not very happy to be disabled&hellip;<br>
So, one could say : let first cousins who want to marry go to a doctor, let pregant women abort if a defect is seen in the embryo.  </p>

		<p>such children receive elaborate care in GB that is probably unavailable in the mother country.</p>
<p>besides bankrupting the NHS, they burden society with countless low grade individuals with learning disabilties, psychological problems, and other deficits.</p>

		<p>This might explain a few things such as the pathetic response<br>
(as expected) of the Pakistani Govt to the flood crisis as their<br>
president took time off to fly by private chopper to his estate<br>
in France while his own country`s  choppers were struggling to deliver aid to flood stricken regions..its also might explain the idiotic behaviour of the entire seemingly corrupter than corrupt  Pakistani cricket team as the evidence keeps building regarding their payoffs from bookmakers to rig international test games&hellip; <br>
probably will greatly damage or ruin the game which might be a good thing for some    <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s almost icomprehensible that Pakistanis, a people able to develop a nuclear bomb, either can&rsquo;t make the connection, or don&rsquo;t care, between consanguinity and birth defects and often retarded or otherwise imperfect offspring.</p>
<p>Weird, really weird.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a great way to ensure the Paks don&rsquo;t take over Britain, actually. Of course the trick is to deny these deformed offspring any public aid or comfort. </p>
<p>Hint, go to a Muslim nation.</p>
<p>Too bad Britain has a National Health Service with &#8220;universal&#8221; care, (where have I heard that before?) and an education system committed to put these Subcontinent and African ingrates, retarded or not, into British schools. A once decent school system is horrid, filled with foreign students who hate Britain from birth.</p>
<p>Thanks Winston Churchill. What you saved you later destroyed.</p>

		<p>Contrary to the story of Pakistani scientific prowess-the Pakistanis &amp; the Indians really don&rsquo;t have advance atomic weapons-the Paks were aided by North Korea &co.; and the Indians themselves (Santhanam) have raised doubts over the true state of their &#8220;advanced&#8221; arsenals.They are both categorized as primitive nuclear states-as for consanguineous-cousin type marriages in the Muslim/Pakistani/Arabic lands-this explains the apparent lack of progress of Islam/middle Eastern/Arabic nations for the last 1400 years,as generations of inbreeding has basically created violent, sex-crazed,religious fanatics.</p>

		<p>i have always thought that thousands of years of Arab cousin marriage causes a lot of the disfunction of the Arab Mediterrean world.</p>
<p>Why, in spite of all their civil disabilities and the discrimination against them did the Christian, Jewish and Zorastrian communities do so much better than the Muslim communities all those years?  Could it be because they didn&rsquo;t practice first cousin marriage for centuries and centuries?</p>
<p>Remember the Turks recruited most of the military and administrators the Janissaries and Mamalukes from their Christian Balkan colonies.  I don&rsquo;t mean recruit, captured 6 year old boys as slaves and trained them.  The Turks also tended to hire Christian or Jewish Arabs rather than Muslims as civil servants in their Arab colonies because the non Muslims were just more functional and competent than the Muslim Arabs.</p>
