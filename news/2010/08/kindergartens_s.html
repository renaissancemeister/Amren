<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/2010-08-27-1Akindergarten27_ST_N.htm">Kindergartens See More Hispanic, Asian Students</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Haya El Nasser and Paul Overberg, USA Today, August 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The kindergarten class of 2010-11 is less white, less black, more Asian and much more Hispanic than in 2000, reflecting the nation&rsquo;s rapid racial and ethnic transformation.</p>
<p>The profile of the 4 million children starting kindergarten reveals the startling changes the USA has undergone the past decade and offers a glimpse of its future. In this year&rsquo;s class, for example, about one out of four 5-year-olds will be Hispanic. {snip}</p>
<p>More Hispanic children are likely in the next generation because the number of Hispanic girls entering childbearing years is up more than 30% this decade, says Kenneth Johnson, demographer at the University of New Hampshire&rsquo;s Carsey Institute. &#8220;It&rsquo;s only the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>* About 25% of 5-year-olds are Hispanic, a big jump from 19% in 2000. Hispanics of that age outnumber blacks almost 2 to 1.</p>
<p>* The percentage of white 5-year-olds fell from 59% in 2000 to about 53% today and the share of blacks from 15% to 13%.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not just a big-city phenomenon,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;The percentage of minority children is growing faster in the suburbs and in rural areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Schools face linguistic challenges. The share of 5-year-olds who speak English at home slipped from 81% in 2000 to about 78%. The share of Spanish speakers grew from 14% to 16%.</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes issues of language development and how to teach them even more important than 10 years ago,&#8221; says W. Steven Barnett, co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. &#8220;In some districts, 40% of their kids are Latino, and 4% of their teachers are. It&rsquo;s a huge gap.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This trend, which we&rsquo;ve known would arrive, will help us.  </p>
<p>Take two above average intelligence, educated White Parents who still believe that their precious children deserve the best of what family and society can provide.  Parents themselves were educated in majority White environments and have above average standards, perceptions, prejudgments, and God-ordained prejudices.</p>
<p>Now, their White Children will be a minority in school and surrounded by below average non whites. Daily will the parents be confronted with the effect of such an environment on their progeny&rsquo;s development, and given that said parents are superior to the average, they will know that they have  a very serious problem. They will suffer through trying to overcome the school&rsquo;s insistence that their promising, gifted White Children perform down to the average of the below average, which will be far below innate capacity and native intelligence.</p>
<p>These parents will not chant Diversity is our Strength at the PTA meeting, thus giving our White Humanity another victory on the long, hard struggle towards rightful and ordained White Destiny.</p>
<p>Transcend Tolerance, Embrace Whiteness, Beware &amp; Prepare!</p>
<p>Whiteness is Rightness- Seize It!</p>

<p>This is truly gut wrenching with regard to the white percentage. Worse still, is the sickeningly optimistic and sweet as cyanide tone this article takes on the subject: &ldquo;The profile of the 4 million children starting kindergarten reveals the startling changes the USA has undergone the past decade and offers a glimpse of its future.&rdquo; How appalling can you get; these two diversity apparatchik are so anti-white and debased, that they even seem to willing to throw black kindergartners under the school bus of sorrow to have their &ldquo;utopia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, what else would you expect from &ldquo;USA Today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Why the drop in black birth rates?  I don&rsquo;t believe it.  They must have re-categorized hispanic blacks in the hispanic column.  I wonder what percentage of these schools would still be hispanic if ICE agents were posted at the entrances each morning?</p>

		<p>I can sympathize with poster #2.</p>
<p>I also almost NEVER EVER see any white children, even in those areas where there are still some whites.  I cannot, for the life of me, remember the last time I saw a white couple pushing a baby stroller.</p>
<p>But today I saw a gazillion latinas with strollers and 3-4 toddlers in tow.</p>
<p>What will the future hold when this is a 50% latino country in a about 20 years?  Will it be like Brazil, as some posters have suggested, where a white elite lords it over the teeming, dark masses?  </p>
<p>What will become of black people?  Latinos have no time for them and their &#8216;special needs&rsquo;.  For whites we can survive in a USA that becomes Spanish speaking because all the latinos I know like white people, probably because we&rsquo;re fairly likeable for the most part, but blacks and latinos will have a bitter race war.  Blacks will seek shelter among us, but by then it will be PC to exclude blacks from our few remaining territories.</p>

		<p>The new 10th grade text books are in. I bet my black students won&rsquo;t notice that they contain mostly latino stories, with token Asian and African stories mixed in. Once these students realize they have been bumped off the &#8220;pander to&#8221; list, there might be some grumbling. Or, maybe not, as grumbling takes effort&hellip;</p>

		<p>I occasionally read comments from zero population growth malthusians on Amren saying how not having children improves one&rsquo;s standard of living. Yeah, well, this is the house their lunacy built for my children. But at least their children won&rsquo;t have to suffer through it. Because they were too impotent to have any in the first place.</p>

		<p>In reply to 4-Anon: I don&rsquo;t think there has been such a drop in the black birth rate, it&rsquo;s just that there are now so many more Hispanic children that the percentage of Blacks (and Whites) is dropping.  Otherwise, the thing I find odd in all of this is the consistent belief of our Multicult leaders that America will hold together as a Nation under the pressures of such linguistic, cultural, religious and ethnic change.  Neo-con Republican politicians speak of the need to amnesty Hispanics to gain their vote, while the Marxist Democrats say the same thing. When in the end and with the majority, the Hispanics dump all &#8220;American&#8221; political parties and form their own &#8220;LaRaza National Party&#8221; of some sort, what then will come of the Country? Actually, at this point, I would support Hispanics claiming the Southwest. Blacks could carve out a section of the Southeast, and with some population displacement, White people could also have a separate nation. America will be lost to history, but with the lessons learned, we all may actually get along better in general, and specifically for us (White Americans) we could start moving away from this death spiral in which we currently find ourselves.</p>

		<p>That is very disturbing. However, keep in mind two things - firstly, keep in mind that, since many illegal immigrant children attend public schools (right?), the Hispanic numbers would be a bit lower if all the illegal immigrants were suddenly deported, which is something I think Republicans will eventually begin to push for once the Tea Party movement grows in significance. Secondly, the fact that the black percentage dropped 3 points, out of 16, means a lot in terms of our nations future. It won&rsquo;t be long before they start getting as mad about Hispanic migration as a lot of whites are, and a breaking up of the &#8220;black and brown&#8221; bloc can only be a good thing.</p>

		<p>Why are statistics on Asians always hidden?  Latino, black and white 5 year-old students account for 91%, so how many of the remaining nine percent are Asian?  Are homeschooled students counted in these statistics?  I think white people should focus on white children and make sure they reach their academic potential and graduate from college.  Around 80% of Indians in America have college degrees while about 30% of white Americans do.</p>

		<p>Wait till you see the Canadian model take root in the US.  Up here in the Torontos and Vancouvers the ethnic breakdown of kindergarten students would be something along the lines of 50% Indian/Pakistani, 30% Chinese, 10% Black/African, 7% Other, 3% White/European.</p>

		<p>As an indication of the challenge this demographic change will present to our government school systems, recent research indicates Latino toddlers (two to three years old) already &#8220;trail their white counterparts by up to six months in understanding words, speaking in more complex sentences and performing such simple tasks as assembling puzzles&#8221; (&ldquo;Studies Find Latino Toddlers Lag White Children in Cognitive Skills,&#8221; Los Angeles Times [Tribune Newspapers], October 20, 2009):<br>

<p>The white-Hispanic &#8220;toddler achievement gap&#8221; widens to a three-and-a-half-to-four-year &#8220;12th grader achievement gap&#8221; (Closing the Achievement Gap, National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) <br>

<p>The federal government is thus putting the nation&rsquo;s government schooling monopolies under ever increasing strain. There is no hope they can meet this challenge. <br>

		<p>So now it&rsquo;s official. The newest generation of children of European background in the United States will be entering a &#8220;brave new world&#8221; in which they will simply grow up as simply the largest minority in a nation of minorities, and a shrinking minority at that.</p>
<p>If Wilmot Robertson were alive today and writing his book it would be titled &#8220;The Dispossessed Minority&#8221;, since European-Americans will soon be in even worse shape, aside from having been dispossessed they will be a minority.</p>
<p>However, I still predict that there will be an awakening before long. Don&rsquo;t give up!</p>

		<p>What bugs me is the negative commentary on the Japanese.  Yes, they have suffered a demographic down turn but when you figure they are headed from 128 million to 70 or so, that&rsquo;s _not a bad thing_.</p>
<p>They also have significant plans in place to both:</p>
<p>1.  Get mothers out of the home.<br>
2.  Reapportion the retail jobs sector to get rid of the hanging <br>
    meat effect.<br>
3.  Invite the elderly to reenter a part time jobs market.<br>
4.  Reschedule industry and sciences to remove the dull-dirty-<br>
    dumb elements of heavy manufacture and outsource them to <br>
    places like the Philippines.<br>
5.  _MASSIVELY_ increase their automation.</p>
<p>Compare this to the U.S. which, for some reason, thinks that it owns anything anymore in the way of high end blue to low end white collar jobs and even, increasingly, R&D.;  We don&rsquo;t.  We have dumbed down our own native population with the whole &#8216;we are the world&rsquo; nonsense to a level where there is nothing to be said for the reason why _we are ourselves_, the best competitors and highest earners, by work product, of any race or nation.</p>
<p>And you see a disproportionate degree of internal market assumption to economic draw down solution based success story.  The Japanese faced up to their aging demographics and are on the way to creating a society where 4 robots pay for 1 person at the bleeding edge of technical achievement.</p>
<p>Rather than do that, we are filling up our open spaces with junk consumers on the totally erroneous belief that they will pay &#8216;someone&rsquo; to take care of our aging demographic and thus if we keep consuming -someone else- will give us the goods to make consumerist economics function in paying off everyone.  As a giant pyramid scheme.  That just ain&rsquo;t so.</p>
<p>Marx was right about the Proletariat.  He just didn&rsquo;t account for the general stupidity and self interest that race connotes as limits to social utopia.  Raceless Robots are the perfect Prole.  Not Mexicans.</p>
<p>I would also like to comment on the notion that the little kids will grow up resentful minorities and push for a radical, racial, solution.</p>
<p>No Way.</p>
<p>They will grow up stupid and desensitized to the extent to which they are &#8216;not part of the cohesive whole&rsquo; awareness doesn&rsquo;t in fact make them envious.  This is the generational process by which those behind this mess count on &#8216;their way or age out and die&rsquo; approach to achieve success.</p>
<p>If you are punished for acknowledging racial differences, sooner or later you will become homogenized in your attitudes and then homogenized in your breeding habits.</p>
<p>And the middle class will dissolve in a wave of brownness and the elites will rule a polymorphic underclass fed on the cheapest of the cheap in everything from food to entertainment.</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s be honest here.  Robert Malthus wrote-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
This train of thought counterpoints Malthus&rsquo; stand on public assistance to the poor. He proposed the gradual abolition of poor laws by gradually reducing the number of persons qualifying for relief. Relief in dire distress would come from private charity.[28] He reasoned that poor relief acted against the longer-term interests of the poor by raising the price of commodities and undermining the independence and resilience of the peasant.[citation needed] In other words, the poor laws tended to &#8220;create the poor which they maintain&#8221;.[29]</p>
<p>It offended Malthus that critics claimed he lacked a caring attitude toward the situation of the poor. In the 1798 edition his concern for the poor shows in passages such as the following:</p>
<p>Nothing is so common as to hear of encouragements that ought to be given to population. If the tendency of mankind to increase be so great as I have represented it to be, it may appear strange that this increase does not come when it is thus repeatedly called for. The true reason is, that the demand for a greater population is made without preparing the funds necessary to support it. Increase the demand for agricultural labour by promoting cultivation, and with it consequently increase the produce of the country, and ameliorate the condition of the labourer, and no apprehensions whatever need be entertained of the proportional increase of population. An attempt to effect this purpose in any other way is vicious, cruel, and tyrannical, and in any state of tolerable freedom cannot therefore succeed.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus</a></p>
<p>Essentially leveling the problems of the world at the ultra wealthy who sought more of the same by increasingly exploiting labor to provide more productive goods at cheaper and cheaper rates.  The poor could only survive this way (mass productivity increase = real lower labor wages through higher total population and thus product costs) by virtue of &#8216;poor law&rsquo; relief.</p>
<p>He insisted that the way to level the situation so that no major upswing or recession in population numbers occurred was NOT to encourage the poor to breed rapidly while supporting them with what we would now call Social Welfare.</p>
<p>The one tacit acknowledgment he made to &#8216;wealthy farmer&rsquo; capitalist enterprise was the acknowledgment that if this created not native class exploitation system was not put into place, man in his savage state, would have no reason to begin the march towards a society which -could- feed all who were legitimately born.  Rather than merely all who were hungry.</p>
<p>The man was not dumb.</p>

		<p>So often I hear of whites becoming a minority. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. Why is it that white couples have very few or even no children? Why then be surprised if we become a minority?<br>
The solution, one of them at least, is for us to have more children and raise larger white families.<br>
 <br>
I saw the most beautiful thing in the grocery store this summer. It was a father, clearly very proud of his role as dad, with his happy wife and 4 children. All 4 children were well dressed in normal clothes, and everyone was well behave. No grabbing and demanding and pushing for what they wanted for dinner. No rude language or nonsense. You never saw such polite kids,such normal dressed folks and such a happy family.</p>

		<p>In San Francisco, there is an elementry  school that is majority white, the only one that I know of.But it is private. White homeowners pay out huge property taxes to support the afrocentric public school system which they dont use, and then they pay a second time to give their children a decent school enviornment.   </p>

<p>We would never be a minority in our own lands if not for nonwhite immigration into our lands. Whites would marry Whites and have babies if not for the nonwhites in our lands. </p>
<p>Why do we have to keep up with those who should not be here in the first place?</p>
<p> There is no way that Whites can procreate themselves faster than all the many minority races we have in this country! To outdo the hispanics alone, Whites would have to have 8 babies each and we don&rsquo;t have the child bearing age demographic whatsoever to accomplish out-breeding just one race, let alone all the other races combined. </p>
<p>No, something else has to be done to have a future that will ensure our children of a future! We have to take back our land and if we don&rsquo;t then there is no hope of White survival.</p>

		<p>What a waste of money to educate from kindergarten to high school millions of fundementally lazy nonEuropeans descended from Africa and the Indian tribes of Latin America who will inevitably drop out from high school or the community colleges, regardless of the expensive but cosmetic changes the Administration&rsquo;s &#8220;Race to the Top&#8221; Education program would encourage at the local level.</p>
<p> Obama&rsquo;s education programs are just an excuse to pump money to his allies in local school districts, and will not more effectively educate anyone of any race. Nor will it slash the dropout rate, unless standards are relaxed again and again. Put nothing, however, past left- progressives who run education to dilute standards to claim success. </p>
<p>Even if these ministudents make it thru high school, their ability to function in useful jobs from house repair to hitech research will be minimal. </p>
<p>Massive Population Control of nonproductive groups, as scientists decades proposed, is the best way to raise educational standards and results. Too late for that. </p>
<p>PC has triumphed. And aren&rsquo;t all kids in Kindergarten so cute?</p>

		<p>There are those, such as &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; who posted earlier in response to what I had written, who think that there never will be a reaction by European-American young people even as they realize that they are the lowest on the &#8220;totem pole&#8221; of minorities in a nation of minorities. I will now explain why I disagree with this:</p>
<p>First of all, given the reality of about a 15 point average I.Q. gap of young whites compared with blacks and Hispanics in the school system, an &#8220;even playing field&#8221; as far as competition to enter universities and jobs would result in a disproportionate number of whites in the best educational institutions and later in the kind of work that provides a salary that allows a middle class life style. The powers that be realize that the only way to get to some kind of even equality of results is to continue affirmative action in order to reach this goal.</p>
<p>To justify their doing this, the myth of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; needs to be maintained, and to do this it is necessary to teach a history to young whites which makes them feel guilty for their &#8220;evil&#8221; ancestors, who were colonialists over non-white peoples, brought slaves to this country, tried to exterminate the Native Americans, and set up Jim Crow laws in the South until the &#8220;noble&#8221; Civil Rights movement came along to move this country in the direction of full racial equality. So far this program has worked pretty well, and I agree with &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; that if nothing changes in the world view of young whites our race is doomed.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s one thing to practice White Bashing as it is done now, when whites are still the majority ethnic group in the U.S., but it will be quite another when the eventual minority group of young whites reach full consciousness that they are being discriminated against in education and a tight job market. At that point an ethnic solidarity will finally kick in and be then expressed in the political arena.</p>

		<p>To answer #18:</p>
<p>You say &#8220;Whites would marry Whites and have babies if not for the nonwhites in our lands.&#8221;</p>
<p>While I agree that it is important to limit, or better yet, even eliminate non-white immigration I also believe it is wrong to blame non-white immigration for limiting white family size. How is it that non-white immigration prevents white couples from having larger families? We whites have CHOSEN to have few or no children, hence the problem. </p>
<p>What stops us is, in my opinion, from having larger families is ourselves. It is our priorities and values in the late 20th/early 21st centuries that have done this.  My great-grandparents had 12 children, of which 8 survived to adulthood. No, they were not farmers, either. They lived in a time with far fewer safety nets than today. But even later generations still held to the idea of large family. I am 49. In my neighborhood, there were families that had 5 or 6 children, all in late 1950&rsquo;s starter homes, no less!! Today, it is the fashion to have few or no children, and/or not even get married at all. Some women choose to have children with no father. I can&rsquo;t imagine that  being raised with no father will be healthy for the children.I am no expert on that topic but I hope I am wrong. I doubt it, though.  What are we doing to ourselves as a race? What are we doing to our families and to future generations? </p>
<p>Perhaps some say that it costs too much, that they don&rsquo;t have the money to have larger families. Yes, things cost a great deal. However, where are our priorities? Do the same people who say they can&rsquo;t afford children then go out to purchase expensive cars, endless electronic gadgets that go out of fashion almost as fast as they come on the market, expensive fashion (sewn in usually non-white areas), trendy (often non-white) ethnic or gourmet foods, extravagant high priced vacations (again, often to non-white areas of the planet)? Where do our values come from? For many, it seems that their values are taken from media, television and movies, or the lyrics of vulgar music, which is again often non-white in origin. Rap &#8220;music&#8221; comes to mind. I see young people acting in shockingly vulgar ways that would have gotten me in serious trouble back in my youth. </p>
<p>I remember my mother made her own clothes, even until the late 1980&rsquo;s. Would many women do that today? My father raised some food at home, and encouraged frugality, no matter what the kids in the neighborhood wore or owned.  Do many parents do all that today? I hope so. I don&rsquo;t see it,however, at least not very often. The children in our family had to work for everything we had, or at least pitch in and help. We had to behave ourselves OR ELSE. I turned out the bettr for all this, I assure you. </p>
<p>Some posters have said they will not raise children because the white race is becoming a minority. This to me is quitting before we have even tried!!! I personally believe it is NOT too late, not if we wake up as a race, and have larger families. Let&rsquo;s get our priorities straight. It is not too late for us as a race. </p>

		<p>I think the black birth rate HAS dropped a great deal.  When I was growing up in the 60s, black women often had gigantic broods of kids.  Now, it is the Hispanic women who are having their first baby very young, and often having four or more children before they quit.  </p>
<p>I think blacks figured out that raising kids was expensive and exhausting when welfare reform went through in the 90s, but Hispanics have a different economic mindset.  For blacks in the old days, if you had enough kids, the government benefits gave you a better lifestyle than what you would have had if you had married the average black guy and had two or three kids.  With the Hispanics, government benefits a simply a SUPPLEMENT to whatever the husband/father can earn working off the books.  And once you have three kids with an uneducated wife, the fourth, fifth, and sixth child really don&rsquo;t cost that much, because there is no opportunity cost to the wife staying home.</p>
<p>If you get HUD housing, food stamps, WIC, free medical care, and welfare, then your BASIC needs are met, and whatever your husband earns off the books as a sheetrocker or bricklayer is pure gravy.  </p>
<p>The black girls of today seem to genuinely enjoy high school, and want to graduate and possibly go on to college.  Hispanic girls do not seem as motivated, and I think there is more pressure on them to enter the workforce to earn money for the family.  Because Hispanics often live with two or three families in one dwelling, they have built-in child care, so they aren&rsquo;t as trapped as middle-class families who can&rsquo;t afford a sitter.  </p>
<p>Also, Hispanics who  have grown up dirt poor in Guatemala, etc., are likely to feel &#8220;rich&#8221; because they have a house with two toilets and a big screen TV.  They feel confident about the future for their children, who are probably US citizens, and so they feel that they can afford a big family.  Working class and lower-middle class whites feel that they have to move to a &#8220;good&#8221; neighborhood with &#8220;good&#8221; schools, and they limit their family size in order to be able to do that.  Hispanics who never got beyond the sixth or eighth grade in some squalid rural school in Central America are overly impressed by the facilities of the public schools even in the worst of America&rsquo;s bad neighborhoods.  Hispanic kids in America grow up to be bilingual, and first in line for most government jobs, so Hispanics are probably correct to assume that their children are getting a good education here in America.</p>
