<h1>Ind. Ruling Halts Caregiver Choices Based on Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Wilson, Google News, August 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Certified nursing assistant Brenda Chaney was on duty in an Indiana nursing home one day when she discovered a patient lying on the floor, unable to stand.</p>
<p>But Chaney couldn&rsquo;t help the woman up. She had to search for a white aide because the woman had left instructions that she did not want any black caregivers. And the nursing home insisted it was legally bound to honor the request.</p>
<p>The episode, which led to a recent federal court ruling that Chaney&rsquo;s civil rights had been violated, has brought to light a little known consequence of the patients&rsquo; rights movement that swept the nation&rsquo;s health care system over the last two decades.</p>
<p>Elderly patients, who won more legal control over their quality of life in nursing homes, sometimes want to dictate the race of those who care for them. And some nursing homes enforce those preferences in their staff policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people write laws, they don&rsquo;t think about these types of things very much,&#8221; said Dennis Frick, an attorney with Indiana Legal Services&rsquo; Senior Law Project.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1987, Congress enacted the Nursing Home Reform Law to address evidence of widespread abuse of nursing home patients. {snip}</p>
<p>But the emphasis on patient rights led some nursing homes to think they outweighed everything else.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under federal law, nursing home residents are free to choose their own physicians. Indiana&rsquo;s law is broader, saying patients can choose their &#8220;providers of services.&#8221; Both laws say nursing homes must reasonably accommodate residents&rsquo; &#8220;individual needs and preferences.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nursing homes can be hotbeds of racial friction, said David Smith, a Drexel University professor who has studied racial integration in hospitals and long-term care centers. In urban areas, staffs are often predominantly African-American while most patients are white. Some elderly people revert in dementia to the prejudices they grew up with.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Courts have held that patients can refuse to be treated by a caregiver of the opposite sex, citing privacy issues. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruling in Chaney&rsquo;s case last month, said applying that accommodation to race goes too far.</p>
<p>&#8220;The privacy interest that is offended when one undresses in front of a doctor or nurse of the opposite sex does not apply to race,&#8221; the ruling said.</p>

		<p>I worked in healthcare for over 30 years, and I&rsquo;m quite sure that such racial preferences have nothing to do with modesty.  Some whites just don&rsquo;t like blacks and vice versa, but most patients probably wouldn&rsquo;t care who helped them up off the floor.  Sometimes caregivers will use excuses not to help a particular patient, and I wonder if this was one of those instances.  Patients in IN will probably still be able to reject particular caregivers, however, so as long as they don&rsquo;t cite race as the reason.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Certified nursing assistant Brenda Chaney&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the setup.  Already we have in our minds the vision of an educated, highly trained Black Professional.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But Chaney couldn&rsquo;t help the woman up. She had to search for a white aide because the woman had left instructions that she did not want any black caregivers. And the nursing home insisted it was legally bound to honor the request.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Oh, that poor, poor black &#8220;caregiver!&#8221;  How it must have broken her heart to see an elderly White woman lying on the floor, and be unable to extend the hand of benevolence to her!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Elderly patients, who won more legal control over their quality of life in nursing homes, <b>sometimes</b> want to <b>dictate</b> the race of those who care for them.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Just &#8220;sometimes,&#8221; you see.  Just a handful of old White crackpots making life difficult for their dedicated black &#8220;caregivers.&#8221;  Imagine those old fools trying to &#8220;dictate&#8221; such a thing!  It&rsquo;s shocking, I tell you!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;When people write laws, they don&rsquo;t think about these types of things very much.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Or maybe they did, and that&rsquo;s why the laws were written?  No, impossible.  No one could <i>ever</i> knowingly risk Offending a &#8220;black caregiver.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But the emphasis on patient rights led some nursing homes to think they outweighed everything else.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Such as what, Charles Wilson?  Such as the tender sensitivities of blacks?  God forbid that &#8220;some&#8221; nursing homes could overlook such a momentous factor.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Nursing homes can be hotbeds of racial friction, said David Smith, a Drexel University professor who has studied racial integration in hospitals and long-term care centers.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Racial friction&#8221; in this context means &#8220;Evil White Racism.&#8221;  But then, any &#8220;study&#8221; conducted by a university professor is unlikely to &#8220;discover&#8221; anything else, which is why it&rsquo;s so smugly cited by Comrade Wilson.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In urban areas, staffs are often predominantly African-American while most patients are white. Some elderly people revert in dementia to the prejudices they grew up with.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Aha! <i>There&rsquo;s</i> the stinger!  Anyone who&rsquo;d object to the tender ministrations of &#8220;African-American&#8221; staff <i>must</i> be suffering from dementia!  After all, isn&rsquo;t Racism demented by definition?  And who cares about preserving the rights of &#8220;some&#8221; elderly who are just blinded by dementia anyway?  Vile old bigots!  Those crazed geriatric Racists don&rsquo;t deserve rights, anyway!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The privacy interest that is offended when one undresses in front of a doctor or nurse of the opposite sex does not apply to race,&rdquo; the ruling said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Why not?  Surely in any common-sense world, there&rsquo;s no difference.  Both are personal preferences.  Did the almighty solons of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals feel any need to explain their godlike pronouncements to we mere mortals?</p>
<p>So now even our elderly and sick are legally forbidden to escape the company of blacks.  How long before such choices are forbidden to the rest of us, as well?  Yet all that Comrade Wilson and his ilk see as important is the delicate hurt feelings of those poor, wounded black &#8220;caregivers.&#8221;   <br>
 <br>
Personally, I pray that Comrade Wilson himself ends up in one of those &#8220;integrated&#8221; urban nursing homes, where he can spend his last days reveling in the Diversity he so assiduously promoted for the rest of us.</p>

<p>This is why, Apartheid must be the an undisputed and rigid norm in this country, until multiculturalism is utterly crushed and the USA is 100% white in population composition!</p>
<p>No: hospital, nursing home, school, park, beach, shopping mall, church, restaurant, or even a public toilet, should be &ldquo;integrated.&rdquo; After all, as we are all &ldquo;capable&rdquo; human beings, but marred with &ldquo;prejudices,&rdquo; there is no reason to integrate at all. For example, blacks can go to their medical schools and then provide the sort of &ldquo;culturally specific&rdquo; care that they require and often demand. The same for: Hispanics, Arabs, and Asians, of course.</p>
<p>Whites will just have to do with the &ldquo;inferior and racist&rdquo; care we provide for ourselves.</p>
<p>In the end, wouldn&rsquo;t we get what we really deserve and the nonwhite &ldquo;enriches&rdquo; as well?</p>
<p>Just something to ponder,</p>

		<p>But, of course! Any White person who would refuse the ministrations of blacks has to be suffering from dementia, which causes them to relive their evil, racist past!</p>
<p>My aunt is in a nursing home, with black ministrators. Every time my mother takes her some new clothes, they immediately disappear. Strange. Demented. </p>
<p>Of course, it is not the black helpers taking the clothes. Something else is going on here, something perfidious.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that always the standard reply. In other words we are not to face any racial truths. That is, if we are White. </p>
<p>Prejudice is a NORMAL and defensive instinct! I do not know of ONE White who wants to have a doctor or a nurse of a different race! I don&rsquo;t trust them for one thing and I surely do not want them giving me baths or changing my diapers in old age!  Why should we desire that? We know how they hate Whites to begin with and can you just imagine the stuff (made up, of course) they say behind your back and to their co-workers and family and friends? Bring segregation back into every aspect of our lives from prisons to nursing homes.</p>

<p>There is little to no interaction seen and the &#8216;nurses&rsquo; and &#8216;aides&rsquo; look like they are affronted having to take care of some grizzled old white bat.</p>
<p>Everyday I hope I die while I&rsquo;m still capable of looking after myself.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want to end my days asa helpless old coot at the mercy of someone who, in other circumstances, might try to rob me.</p>

		<p>How were Chaney&rsquo;s civil rights violated? How can she possibly show injury? The patient has the right to autonomy and to decide who will care for her. The ruling is just another of the totalitarian absurdities in store for the white world.</p>

		<p>But don&rsquo;t at least some blacks prefer to be nursed by other blacks?  As long as that door swings in both directions, I don&rsquo;t see why it has to present problems.  Surely there are black hospice patients whose dying request is not to have to look at any more white faces.  I&rsquo;d be willing to respect that, as long as my own wishes were respected. </p>
<p>Another simple situation is being complicated by the lack of common sense &amp; decency, &amp; the denial of human nature. </p>

<p>While the black nurses and personnel engage in the racism they have practiced all their lives and careers.  My older sister had a mid length stay in a Sacramento hospital years ago.  While visiting her, I noted the rough treatment she received from the nurse, who seemed to relish demonstrating to me how she could treat my sister like an oject to be shoved and pushed about her bed, knowing that making an issue of it would raise questions about my assumed racism.  I was neutral in those days, but that was probably one early event that led to my later attitudes about race realism.</p>

<p>Yeah, right. You&rsquo;re going to tell me that those rules applied even in the case of an emergency? Why would Chaney go into the woman&rsquo;s room if she wasn&rsquo;t allowed there?</p>
<p><i>The episode, which led to a recent federal court ruling that Chaney&rsquo;s civil rights had been violated&hellip;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;The episode LED to&hellip;?&#8221; Hmmm, convenient passive voice there. Who was it who raised a stink and brought the case to federal attention? Why it was Chaney herself, of course.</p>
<p>Merrillville, Indiana, a suburb of Gary, is also turning black. A while back, one of the Merrillville nursing homes was shut down by the feds due to unacceptable conditions found there. Something tells me the home was staffed by &#8220;certified nursing assistants&#8221; like Brenda Chaney.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There is little to no interaction seen.&#8221; When my Dad was at his nursing home there was a pleasant enough but terribly obese White lady on the staff. I never much liked her and would give just a cursory response to her greetings on my way in or out of the facility. <br>
  Then one day I came at an unxpected time. I happened to walk past the kitchen when my Dad was &#8220;helping&#8221; her make the morning coffee. Words fail to describe what I saw. But suffice it to say you could just feel the love she had for my Dad. I slipped out the door without being seen because I was too overcome for the moment. From then on I was secure and happy  knowing my Dad was safe, well taken care of and with  a person who seemed to care more for him than anybody but one of us Mc Hugh`s. When he died,<br>
we were humbly able to return the favor by giving her a virtually new Ford Taurus that we had parked when he went into the home. What won me over was seeing the interaction between them on something as simple as a morning routine&hellip;<br>

		<p>Poster #1, seems to be in denial about what WHITE patients FEEL when blacks are their caregivers, everything from bathing them to pushing them around.</p>
<p> Yes, deliberately pushing and shoving them, stealing from them or worse, even RAPE!  We have read about it even here on Amren. I, for one, will never allow any black around me when I cannot protect myself or have to the strength to do so!  These old people are frail and so drugged up that we DO know what happens to them in these &#8220;nursing&#8221; homes. Maybe do some research on it.</p>

		<p>I just been on Google trying to trace a few  links to reports I had read not so long agao where a group of Afro Carribean(as we call them in Britain)&rsquo;care workers &#8216;were caught CCTV abusing the (white) elderly. This has in fact occured quite frequently since local authorities started taking on  black care workers. But dont ever expect to see it as  a storyline for a soap drama unless the abuser  is played by a white person.  Btw, despite the overwhelming mass of evidence and the tone of language used, the care workers got found &#8216;not guilty.&rsquo; Astonishing. Wonder what the judge and jury were made up off.I suppose I should also wonder how it ever even got to prosecution stage.  </p>

		<p>SeenitHappen: Two Black MPs on White nurses being too White to look after elderly Black folk. </p>
<p>Diane Abbott and the case of the &#8220;blonde, blue-eyed Finnish girls,&#8221; 1996</p>
<p>In 1996 Abbott was accused of racism when she suggested that &#8220;blonde, blue-eyed Finnish girls&#8221; in her local hospital in West London were unsuitable as nurses because they &#8220;may never have met a black person before&#8221;. Ms Abbott&rsquo;s comments were supported by Bernie Grant, a fellow black MP whose constituency, Tottenham, borders hers. &#8220;She is quite right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bringing someone here from Finland who has never seen a black person before and expecting them to have some empathy with black people is nonsense.&#8221; Conservative MP Ian Bruce stated that he had &#8220;never heard such racist rubbish from a Member of Parliament in recent years&#8221;. Abbott was also accused of ignorance by the Anti-Racist Alliance executive member Marc Wadsworth, who is half-Finnish, pointed out that at that time the Miss Finland, Lola Odusoga, was black, of Nigerian and Finnish descent. &#8220;She&rsquo;s a black Finn like me,&#8221; he said. Abbott apologized for her remarks and said her main priority was to ensure that her constituents received medical treatment from the very best people &#8220;irrespective of race&#8221;.</p>

Ah, yes.  I didn&rsquo;t catch onto that immediately. But you are right. It doesn&rsquo;t take any special &#8220;caregiving&#8221; skills  just to help someone up off the floor.  What I sense here is a &#8220;caregiver&#8221; who was probably gloating and who relished seeing the old woman down there in this helpless condition.  She was going to make sure to rub it in and make her point. </p>
<p>Who was really the unfeeling, insensitive culprit here? Whose dignity and rights were violated?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone on the floor is going to mind what hand reaches out to help them up.  That&rsquo;s not the same thing as what&rsquo;s meant by medical &#8220;caregiving&#8221;. </p>

		<p><i>Bernie Grant, a fellow black MP, said,  &ldquo;She is quite right. Bringing someone here from Finland who has never seen a black person before and expecting them to have some empathy with black people is nonsense.&rdquo; <br>
 <br>
Abbott was accused of ignorance by the Anti-Racist Alliance executive Marc Wadsworth, who is half-Finnish, pointed out that at that time the Miss Finland, Lola Odusoga, was black, of Nigerian and Finnish descent. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a black Finn, like me,&rdquo; he said. </i></p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>That is really ridiculous.  Just about anybody would know that naive persons like Finns, who&rsquo;ve had the LEAST experience with blacks, tend to have the BEST opinions of them. On the other hand, people who&rsquo;ve had a lot of experience with them, are a lot more leery of them.</p>
<p>The silly implication  (or assumption )made above  is that people who are experienced with blacks will like and trust them better. That&rsquo;s nonsense, as anyone who knows better will tell you.</p>
<p>(And, by the way, what is a &#8220;black Finn&#8221;? I just had to ask.)</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Some elderly people revert in dementia to the prejudices they grew up with.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Prejudices. Sure. </p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re about to die, you want to be cared by your own. By people you can relate to as being from your extended family. Such a bond obviously cannot exist with a carer of a different race. It&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s fault. It&rsquo;s just real.</p>
<p>That wish is a very natural and human feeling. It should be respected.</p>
<p>Denying this right to old people for political and ideological reasons is uncivilised in the extreme. It&rsquo;s an act of incredible violence.<br>
