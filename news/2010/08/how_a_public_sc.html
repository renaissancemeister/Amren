			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Tozer, Daily Mail (London), August 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A girl who was abducted at the age of 14 and forced to work as a sex slave was yesterday praised for giving evidence which saw her abusers jailed.</p>
<p>The privately-educated teenager was picked up and plied with vodka and drugs, passed around groups of older men for sex and then forced to work as a prostitute.</p>
<p>Her ordeal highlights previously-aired fears that white schoolgirls are being groomed for underage sex by gangs of Asian men in northern England.</p>
<p>Former Labour MP Ann Cryer provoked a storm when she warned that the practice of arranged marriages helped tempt a criminal minority of Asian men into targeting young, white girls for sex.</p>
<p>After nine men were jailed over the sustained sexual abuse of their victim, Superintendent Paul Savill of Greater Manchester Police commended her bravery and said: &#8216;This young girl has been through an absolutely horrifying ordeal.</p>
<p>&#8216;The level of abuse she has suffered is almost beyond belief. She has been treated like a commodity  &mdash;  beaten, threatened and sexually exploited.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was adopted as a baby by a professional, middle-class couple in Greater Manchester and educated at a private school.</p>
<p>She was removed from the school for exhibiting &#8216;inappropriate sexualised behaviour toward male pupils&rsquo;, a court  heard, and after she twice ran away from home her adoptive parents reluctantly agreed that she be placed in care.</p>
<p>In February 2008 she was picked up in Rochdale by Asad Hassan, 27, who took her to a nightclub.</p>
<p>He and his friends Mohammed Basharat, 27, and Mohammed Atif, 28, then took her to a house where she was given vodka before all three men had sex with her.</p>
<p>The next morning, Hassan, who had given her his phone number, dropped her at a bus station and gave her cigarettes and money, but after being found by her mother she was taken back to the care home.</p>
<p>A week later she went missing again. She met restaurant worker Abdul Rob, 33, in Rochdale and he took her back to a flat where he gave her alcohol before having sex with her.</p>
<p>The following morning she rang Hassan  &mdash;  her initial abuser  &mdash;  and met him, Basharat and Atif who again all had sex with her.</p>
<p>She was then taken to another house in the Rochdale area where she was also abused by a group of men whom police have been unable to trace.</p>
<p>The next day, as police hunted for her, the girl took a bus to Manchester and drifted to the city&rsquo;s &#8216;Curry Mile&rsquo; in Rusholme, where she met Aftab Khan, 30, described by police as a &#8216;nasty, exploitative individual&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Khan, who was acquitted two years ago of having sex with an underage girl, lured her back to his house, gave her alcohol, cocaine and cannabis and offered her a bed for the night.</p>
<p>But between 3am and 4am Khan woke the youngster and told her: &#8216;You&rsquo;re working for me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stabbed a door with a kitchen knife and threatened to harm her unless she complied.</p>
<p>Khan then forced her to work for five nights as a prostitute in Manchester.</p>
<p>The girl drank huge amounts of alcohol to blot out her ordeal and even tried to avoid wearing makeup to make herself look too young for sex, but her ploy failed.</p>
<p>On February 28 last year plain-clothed police officers patrolling the area stopped and questioned the girl as she looked for clients but, fearing Khan, she gave a false name and said she was 16.</p>
<p>The officers took the girl to a bus station so that she could go home. But she returned to Khan, who began to &#8216;tout her round&rsquo; groups of men, boasting that he had a girl who was available for sex.</p>
<p>He took her to a block of flats in Hulme where Mohammed Anwar Safi, 30, Ahmed Noorzai, 28, and Mohammed Khan, 25, were waiting.</p>
<p>Safi and Noorzai had sex with her but Mohammed Khan, who paid the money, said he thought she was &#8216;too young&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The following day the officers who had stopped the girl recognised her from a missing person appeal and suspected that Khan was holding her.</p>
<p>But by the time they got to his home, he had been tipped off and had sent the girl away with Â£5.</p>
<p>She returned to Rusholme where she met Najibullah Safi, 32, who plied her with drink and drugs before having sex with her.</p>
<p>Her ordeal finally ended when she left Safi&rsquo;s house and approached an Asian couple in a car.</p>
<p>Safi tried to drag her away but the woman passenger heard the girl claim she had been raped, and police were called.</p>
<p>In total she is thought to have fallen victim to at least three predatory gangs.</p>
<p>Campaigners say many similar cases go unpunished because the victims refuse to make formal complaints.</p>
<p>However the 14-year-old bravely identified her abusers and gave compelling evidence against them in court, and now nine have been jailed for a variety of offences.</p>
<p>Aftab Khan was jailed for seven years and his friend Abid Khaliq for eight months; Najibullah Safi, Atif, Hassan and Basharat for two years; Mohammed Khan for four years; Mohammed Anwar Safi for 31 months and Noorzai for four years.</p>
<p>In the final case at Manchester Crown Court this week, a judge ordered Rob to be found not guilty after accepting he could reasonably have believed the girl&rsquo;s claims to be over 16.</p>
<p>Yesterday the victim, now 17, condemned her abusers.</p>
<p>&#8216;These people exploit young girls,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;They feed them drugs and alcohol and tell them they love them.</p>
<p>&#8216;I know because it happened to me and it has changed my life enormously.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Martin Narey of Barnardo&rsquo;s said his charity worked with at least 1,000 vulnerable girls a year who had been preyed on in this way.</p>
<p>But he said said there was no evidence of a racial element to such abuse.</p>
<p>&#8216;Those who exploit children in this awful way come from all races,&rsquo; he added.</p>

<p><b>MP Who Drew Link With Asian Culture .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And Provoked a Storm</b></p>
<p>When Labour MP Ann Cryer blamed traditional Asian culture for a &#8216;sex ring&rsquo; dragging white schoolgirls into prostitution, her comments provoked a fierce debate.
<p>She spoke out in 2003 over claims of organised sexual abuse in her West Yorkshire constituency of Keighley, controversially suggesting the problem had to be seen in racial terms.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am merely pointing out fact in saying that all the victims of these terrible crimes are white girls and all the alleged perpetrators are Asian men,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;That is a significant fact and needs to be addressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In her view, young Asian men in traditional communities were unable to pursue casual relationships in the manner of their white peers because they were tied to arranged marriages.</p>
<p>Caught between two cultures, a small number were tempted to target vulnerable young girls, she said.</p>
<p>She was criticised by Muslim community activists, and a subsequent Channel 4 documentary focusing on the problem was pulled amid fears that it would hand political ammunition to the BNP.</p>
<p>Nevertheless mothers in areas with large Asian populations have continued to complain that the authorities have failed to tackle similar abuse.</p>
<p>Last year three Asian men from Keighley were jailed for grooming a vulnerable 14-year-old girl for sex.</p>
<p>Yesterday Mrs Cryer, who stepped down at the last election, said she believed the case had deterred others from perpetrating similar abuse.</p>
<p>She added: &#8216;There are similarities with the case in Greater Manchester, and I very much hope that the same problem does not happen there as well.&rsquo;</p></td><br>

		<p>If you were to merely glance at the title of the article you would get the idea that the girl was a cute little school girl in a fancy private school uniform grabbed off of the street and forced to prostitute herself. This is not entirely the truth. Obviously she had some sort of problem or she would not have had contact with men like these. What the writers of articles like these skirt around are the facts that these girls were dating foriegn men of suspicious backgrounds and were shocked when the men turned on them. Dating Muslim men never leads to anything good, you will be beaten, robbed and otherwise abused and thrown out on the street when your usefulness is over. Instead of constantly warning girls about being abducted off of the street (dont get me wrong teaching girls safety is a good idea) why not warn them about dating outside of their race? Not PC by a long shot but you will certainly have fewer incidents like this and the constant litany of murders of White girls by black boyfriends. </p>

		<p> Sadly, we too often read false news reports where &#8220;race wasn&rsquo;t a factor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The failure is upon the White journalist who are asking the questions.  Instead of asking &#8220;Do you think race played a role?&#8221;, we all know they should instead ask &#8220;Did these non white perps know that the victim was White?&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, if the non whites KNEW the victim was White, then it was automatically a racially motivated attack and hate crime.</p>
<p>All non white robbers, rapers, and murders know that their White victims are White!<br>

		<p>Take a look at how light the sentences are!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our future.  Non white criminals will be treated with great hospitality by the judicial system when their victims are White.  </p>
<p>There is no justice for Whites because Whites have White Privilege and need to &#8220;do more to atone for the sins of segregation,&#8221; such as suffer robbing, raping, and murdering and then watching their attackers get out of jail very quickly, if ever sentenced at all. </p>

		<p>Wow, how far we have sunk.</p>
<p>A generation or so ago, none of these aliens would have even been allowed in the country.  Now, they just strut around, completely unafraid to abuse white women and to give a collective middle finger to white people as a whole.</p>
<p>Plus they have those Orwellian hate crime laws that prevent native whites from identifying what the problem is.</p>

		<p>In times gone by the most subversive characters in white society were bikers, rock and rollers, and other counter culture types.<br>
It was almost a right of passage to dabble in the sub-culture of these groups.</p>
<p>The recent introduction of multi-racialism has made all that tame by comparison.  During the 1990&rsquo;s white rock music lost its swagger,  and subversive sexuality was associated with non-white males, most notably in the rap gangster genre.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that young white girls are pushing society&rsquo;s buttons. They can see that society is afraid to talk about it. </p>

		<p>Question: Asian can mean Pakistani, Bangladeshi, or Middle Eastern.  Can somebody give me an ethnic breakdwon for the criminals involved in this case?</p>
<p>Physically, a lot the men look Kurdish or Turkish or North African Arab.  Not all, but a lot.  Many look ethnic Bangladeshi/Pakistani, but not all of them.  This despite the fact that there are very few Turks, Kurds, and Arabs in Britain.</p>
<p>In Norway and Sweden, there seems to be a lot of rape that goes on too by Muslims.  Especially Kurdish Muslims from Iraq/Turkey.  </p>
<p>Anybody care to comment on whether the Muslim ethnicities differ by their propensities to crime?    </p>

Speaking of the light sentences, the samething is going on here. A pimp who kidnapped a couple of young girls off the street and forced them into prostitution got only 8 years in jail.  You can guess the races of the kidnapper and victims.</p>

		<p>It,s a good thing that they included photos of the criminals, because the term &#8220;Asians&#8221; can be very misleading. When I, personally, hear &#8220;Asian&#8221;, I think of what used to be called, a yellow person, someone from the Far East.</p>
<p>Of course, India and Pakistan are located in South Asia, but their populations are ethnically and culturally very different for, say, the populations of China or South Korea.</p>
<p>Most Pakistani are Muslim, and a lot of &#8220;Paki&#8221;, as they are called, are involved in the criminal world of major british cities such as London, Manchester, Birmingham. </p>

<p>Its good to see that moslems and pols have their priorities straight. Never mind the children who are kidnapped and raped. The only thing that matters is that the BNP doesn&rsquo;t benefit. That&rsquo;s sarcasm, by the way. My genuine sentiments are VOTE BNP!<br>

		<p>Nothing disgusts me as much as this. A young English girl raped, and the rapists get such lenient sentences. They should be deported or better, killed.</p>
<p>The other races can smell it, and it&rsquo;s sure that these dogs did: we whites don&rsquo;t look after our own. That has to change.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out why, after she had gotten away several times, she went back?  After reading it again, it is a little hard to feel sorry for her.  I picture a teen who wants to rebel.  She had been suspended for lewd conduct at school before all this happened, so obviously she was no angel. Still, Muslims can be counted on to exploit whites any way they can.  </p>

		<p>What I see here is a preemptive strike against the public&rsquo;s awareness of REAL cases of White Slavery.  The media know that readers will dismiss the story of this girl&rsquo;s victimhood as rubbish.  That&rsquo;s why they printed her story: to condition readers to dismiss stories of white girls&rsquo; being turned into sex slaves as being rubbish.</p>
<p>So much more pleasant for us to assume that the story they&rsquo;ve created here (possibly grossly distorted from reality) is the typical scenario: rotten kid, probably from rotten stock, &#8220;asks for it&#8221;.  Betrays her doting adoptive parents, and seeks her own level.</p>
<p>In reality, most of these girls are systematically terrorized, and held against their will.  They are given drugs, and made addicts against their will. Many are never seen again.</p>
<p>After all, if the public can be &#8216;turned off to&rsquo; the subject by silly stories like this one, then when their own daughters and townsfolk start to go missing, they will be far less apt to respond in what would be an appropriate way.</p>

		<p> It seems like the Pakistani, along with Caribbean blacks, have filled the role of pimps in modern day Great Britain. What&rsquo;s unique is that their &#8220;stables&#8221; seem to be made up of mostly indigenous British girls, or other European women, rather than women from their own ethnic backgrounds. British parents should warn their daughters against these nefarious panderers, but that would be considered racist. Racism is considered a more horrible crime than forced prostitution or white slavery.</p>

<p>Way back in the sixties a friend told me this story about his sister. She met a Muslim man in college and married him, and they back to his home country to live. Surprise, surprise, he had two other wives. My friend said his father spent a fortune trying to get her out of there and eventually the State Dept. intervened and managed to get her back to the U.S. He said it took two or three years to get her home.    </p>

		<p>Just wait until the Feminists of the U.K. become aware of this situation. Led by such redoubtable ladies as Cherie Booth, they will soon put an end to this destruction of vulnerable women.<br>

		<p>MULDER at 9.08 PM is entirely wrong when he states that there are &#8220;Very few Turks,Kurds,and Arabs in Britain&#8221;.These people dominate whole districts of London,notably Haringey,Walworth,and Bayswater.The Kebab take-away is ubiquitous throughout England,the number of these premises easily out-numbering the traditional fish and chip shops,which are themselves almost invariably under middle eastern ownership.It is now impossible to calculate how many of these people are resident in the UK,but anything under half a million would be a gross underestimate. </p>

<p>&gt; I read an article a few years ago about the bust of a couple black men who had been running a prostitution ring in NYC since the &rsquo;70s.  They would recruit girls in Minnesota, who were either runnaways or having discipline problems at home, take them to NYC, get them on drugs and pimp them to exhaustion over several years.  This went on for 30 years, and was only one instance.</p>
<p>The problem is that feminism has been filling young females&rsquo; heads full of ideas about &#8220;real independence&#8221; for years.  They young dumbells, raised on soft Lutheran sentiments, and associated liberalism, are the easiest targets on earth.  </p>

		<p>Then who is doing this?  Pakistanis/Bangladeshis or Turks/Arabs/Kurds?  My sense is that the latter groups are much more represented, on a per capita basis.  </p>
<p>In Norway, it&rsquo;s the Kurdish, Arab, abd African Muslims that do a lot of the raping.  Pakistani Muslims, while overrepresented in crime, are comparably well behaved.  </p>
<p>My sense is that a lot of the problems Muslims cause reflect their low IQ, impulsiveness, and religious extremism.  Kurds, Arabs, and Africans are worse in these respects than Pakistanis, Malays, or Albanian Muslims.  Hence, more problems.  </p>

		<p>The title is very misleading, she wasn&rsquo;t abducted and forced to be a sex slave. She started prostituting herself for drugs and attention and eventually a pimp put her to work. She continually returned to these guys. That is NOT a sex slave, that is a child prostitute doing it in part because she thinks her pimp &#8220;loves her&#8221;.</p>

<p>I doubt anyone who reads the article is going to think that at all.  In fact, the article practically screams the opposite.  Short of coming out right and saying it, of course.</p>
