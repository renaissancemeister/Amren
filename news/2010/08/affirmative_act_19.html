			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maura Dolan, Los Angeles Times, August 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The California Supreme Court ruled Monday that Proposition 209, the ballot measure that banned affirmative action by government, did not violate the federal Constitution.</p>
<p>In a 6-1 ruling, the majority rejected a defense argued by San Francisco after it was sued over a program that gave women and minorities an advantage in obtaining city contracts.</p>
<p>The court said the affirmative action program may continue only if the city shows it was narrowly tailored to address intentional discrimination by the city against businesses owned by women and minorities and that preferences were necessary to rectify the discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>San Francisco Deputy City Atty. Sherri Kaiser said the ruling was &#8220;the first time that any case has acknowledged that Proposition 209 is not a flat-out bar to affirmative action programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although disappointed that the court failed to declare the 1996 initiative unconstitutional, Kaiser said she believed the city would be able to justify its program.</p>
<p>The Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest law firm that sued San Francisco on behalf of two companies, disagreed, predicting that the contracting preferences were doomed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a dissent, Justice Carlos R. Moreno contended that Proposition 209 was unconstitutional because it was explicitly race-conscious and established &#8220;a steep hurdle&#8221; for those seeking preferences for race and sex.</p>
<p>Proposition 209 cannot be modified without voter approval of a constitutional amendment, whereas other kinds of preferences can be approved by a mere vote of a city council or other governmental agency, he said.</p>

<p>So ol &#8220;Justice&#8221; Carlos thinks it&rsquo;s &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; for blacks and mexicans not to be able to discriminate against White people! Why would he be against this if he himself wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;explicitly race-conscious&#8221;? I imagine he does all he can to &#8220;establish steep hurdles&#8221; for Whites that seek justice as this clearly shows. </p>

<p>Does it get any better than that?</p>
<p>Hypocrisy may not be classified as such, so long as you admit to it being, at best, questionable and intended. But to outright make a word salad and expect it to hold legal or mental nourishments for the &ldquo;youths&rdquo; and &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo; in the rainbow mosaic of Obamageddon, is a bit much.</p>
<p>Blaak Obongo really hit the nail on the head, when he wrote:</p>

<p>Now what we need is for brave legislators in other states across the country to pass similar laws.</p>
<p>Who knows? With a nationwide ban on affirmative action, maybe white kids will get a fair shot at public universities again. Maybe white people can get a proportionate number of govt jobs again. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Talking about Race&#8221; will always mean demanding that White Humanity &#8220;atones for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges,&#8221; despite what the sillies on the 6-1 ruling say about Affirmative Action.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example of how ridiculous liberals sound when they say we need to talk about race.  Not once are mentioned the black fathers who refuse to marry dey babby momas or the segregationist racism on the Congressional Black Caucus.  Until liberals want to talk about those, conversations about race are just shakedown tactics.</p>

<p>snip</p>
<p>The spring of Obama&rsquo;s presidential race, I joined a few reporters interviewing Bishop Desmond Tutu at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn. A TV reporter asked what Tutu thought about the racial aspects of the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>I thought the question shallow, focused on an irrelevant aspect that surely we Americans were beyond.</p>
<p>Tutu did not think that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Race,&#8221; I remember him saying, &#8220;is the ache in the tummy of America. You have not dealt with it yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huntsville, the community that has long prided itself on not being like those Ignorant White Folks in Birmingham, is beginning to deal with racism. And after we get through this round of talking about this difficult subject (which, after all, means talking about something that none of us, black or white, really believes we possess), eventually we&rsquo;ll probably have to do it again. </p>
<p>Racism, I learned from the Sears catalog, may index itself to an attribute that is only skin deep, but it flows from a condition that ropes into the most unlikely places, roiling along the sea floor of our consciousness, slicking the surface of our world view, and washing up in tar balls along the beaches of our pristine lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clean-up that&rsquo;s underway, but one that will likely take us several more generations.<br>

		<p>Score one for the fast-disappearing Rule of Law, the foundation of Western Civilization:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Rule of Law is a foundation for both our liberties and for order. The rule of law respects us as equals. It allows us to organize our lives, plan our futures, and resolve disputes in a rational way. There are those around the world and throughout history who have fought in great struggles for the rule of law&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The lefties and marxists fight The Rule of Law and Equality Before the Law tooth and nail, but then their goal is to tear down Western Civilization and replace it with an authoritarian, police/state government, with themselves and those they favor above the law  &mdash;  the law being anything they say it is.</p>
<p>The Pacific Legal Foundation is doing a yeoman&rsquo;s job fighting the likes of idiots like jerry brown and San Francisco Deputy City Atty. sherri kaiser, those who wish to impose and enforce their own made-up laws based on skin color or any other whim, laws that make some more equal than others.</p>
<p>They deserve nothing but ridicule, scorn, debasement, mocking and ostracism of the worst sort.  But as we Whites disappear, along with our culture, starting in California, the lefties will start winning and laws such as Prop 209 will be overturned and declared Unconstitutional.</p>
<p>As we disappear, so will The Rule of Law.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>BTW:  This article appeared in my LA paper close to the back page, near the bottom as a small blurb, easily missed, instead of on the Front Page, where it belonged, with a large photo of &#8216;loser&rsquo; jerry brown, who well may be our next governor.   Expect more judicial appointments to the California Supreme Court such as Rose Bird.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Bird was the first Chief Justice to be removed from that office by a majority of the state&rsquo;s voters&hellip;.She was removed in the November 4, 1986 election by a margin of 67 to 33 percent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Only this time around, there won&rsquo;t be enough votes to overturn brown&rsquo;s judicial appointments.</p>

<p>No, we haven&rsquo;t, but we will.   The genome project will do more to advance White Awareness of the Race Problem than anything we&rsquo;ve seen in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>Modern society is built upon the religion of science and rationality.  Once science gives us a rational basis for our instinctive reactions to blacks, we will truly then &#8220;deal with&#8221; race in America.</p>

<p>[i]They waited until whites were a minority in California to ban AA?[/i]</p>
<p>Of course.  Affirmative action is designed to give disadvantaged minorities, i.e. African Americans (isn&rsquo;t it funny how the first letters of the benefits and beneficiaries are the same?) a leg up.  California is well on its way to being majority Hispanic, so AA, left as it is, would saddle the Hispanic majority with the same problems as the White majority that was displaced.  IOW, Latinos have no intentions of paying for Tyrone and all his progeny by several baby mamas, much less educating them or hiring them.  </p>
<p>Elizabeth Wright, a black conservative, who has a blog called Issues and Views addressed this, asking the question of how much Black Entitlement is linked with so-called &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; and how quickly that will change when the USA is a non-White (and non-Black) majority.  </p>
<p>Not to mention other people who have benefited enormously from having a guilty White majority to wrest privileges from since the Jewish Holocaust of WWII.  I can&rsquo;t imagine where they will be too happy with the ultimate outcome, either.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you get when you kill the goose who lays the golden egg.  </p>

<p>I suppose that depends on who the government considers as White these days.</p>
<p>This is from the CST test (California State Test given to all students in California between 2nd and 11th grade), May 2010:</p>
<p>whites:  Having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.</p>
<p>I copied this exactly as it appears on the form, including the uncapitalized  &#8220;white&#8221; although black, hispanic  &mdash;   every other racial/ethnic group listed begins with a capital letter.</p>
<p>Including ethno-centric tribes from the Middle East and North Africa in the &#8220;White&#8221; category beefs up White numbers in California, giving the appearance that Whites are not disappearing in California.</p>
<p>I regularly travel this state from top to bottom and side to side, from the deserts to the mountains, the oceans, down the coast, up the middle and then back again.</p>
<p>You will NEVER convince me that Whites make up 76.6% of this state.</p>
