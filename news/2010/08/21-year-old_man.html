			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dr. Boyce Watkins, Black Voices on Sports, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Julious Threatts is 21 years old, but for some reason, he thinks he can create his own fountain of youth. Threatts was caught trying to impersonate a 14-year-old, so he could play in a youth football league.</p>
<p>Threatts used the alias &#8220;Chad Jordan&#8221; to register for Webb Middle School. The school is located in Tampa, Fla. Threatts told school administrators that he was homeless on the day of his arrival to the school.</p>
<p>After trying to enroll, the Department of Child and Families was called to assist in the situation. That&rsquo;s when Threatts was taken to the cafeteria and even given a snack. When the principal saw him, he immediately noticed that he was too old to be in middle school. He was eventually arrested on trespassing charges.</p>
<p>In addition to his trespassing charge, Threatts is being accused of violating the terms of his probation on an earlier burglary charge. He was kicked off the football team, when coaches from other teams recognized him. He allegedly played in the same youth league a year earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought him into this room with seven of our board members and coaches and said, Come on now, tell us the truth, who are you?&#8221; Ray McCloud, one of the youth coaches, told MSNBC. &#8220;He looked me right in the eye and said, &#8216;I swear I am who I say I am. I&rsquo;m Chad Jordan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;This guy had us all fooled. I mean this guy acted just like a little kid. Everything about him was a little kid. He&rsquo;s a total scam artist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only did Threatts&rsquo; story include his own acting ability, it came with documentation. According to media reports, Threatts had a falsified birth certificate as well as a detailed scouting report from a high school recruiting scout alleged to be from Rivals.com. The report analyzed Chad Jordan and said that he is &#8220;a very special prospect&#8221; who &#8220;hasn&rsquo;t signed&#8221; but has &#8220;offers from USC (University of Southern California), Texas and Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This story, as well as the one of Julious Threatts, makes me think of the infantilization of the black male in America. Through sports and hip-hop, black men are in a peculiar partnership with the educational, economic and criminal justice system to keep themselves uneducated, marginalized and perpetually immature.</p>
<p>We have 35-year-old men running around with their pants sagging, hats cocked to the side and imitating hip-hop artists who have far more money than they will ever see in their lives. There are also former athletes with few professional skills in their late 30s, hoping for another tryout with a team who will accept an aging journeyman. {snip}</p>

		<p>Last year in Chicago, just the opposite happened   &mdash;   A 14-year old pretended to be 21 (or he easily passed for 21) because he wanted to be a Chicago cop a little precociously.  </p>
<p>Why is it that nobody can tell the difference between 14 and 21 anymore?</p>
<p>&#8220;The infantilization of the black man in America.&#8221;  Sounds like words we could write.  But it takes another black man to do it without the inevitable cat calls of the &#8220;dreaded&#8221; R-word.</p>

		<p>Once again, black irresponsibility rears it&rsquo;s head.  The black commentator instead of holding Julious Threatts accountable for his actions shifts blame onto the educational, economic and criminal justice systems which is code for white people.  There was another black 20+ year old who impersonated a high schooler to play basketball who was caught months ago.  The reality is these guys want to win and relive their youth.</p>

<p>Well Dr. Watkins, you may have a point there. It&rsquo;s amazing what welfare and the &#8220;War on Poverty&#8221; has brought about in the past 45 years. Listening to Julious on Youtube, I can see how he passed himself off as a 14 year old. His manner of speech could be mistaken for that of a teenager. I could care less if he wishes to be a modern day Peter Pan (or James Barrie). However, at a minimum, he needs to see a shrink under threat of jail. I wonder if this was a somewhat long term scam to hook up with middle school girls? </p>
<p>Think back to the 1950&rsquo;s; would any 21 yo man try to pass himself off as 14? No, most men of that era (blacks included) were engaged in some sort of productive activity. </p>

<p>Black males may act pretty infantile from time to time, but let&rsquo;s not blame the educational, economic and criminal justice systems. After all, black males generally become fathers (at least in name) at a far earlier age than whites or asians, so how is that the fault of the educational, economic and criminal justice systems?</p>

		<p>Blacks must separate from White civilization in order to create something of their own. Only Blacks have the ability to thin their own gene pool without charges of &#8220;racism.&#8221; If this does not happen, Blacks will become a permanent underclass, totally dependent on their white custodians. This will inevitably lead to violence.</p>

		<p>The use of the term &#8220;infantilization&#8221; begs the question as to in which part of American history they were ever responsible adults.</p>
<p>Even the &#8220;successful&#8221; blacks today think islands like Guam will capsize if overloaded, can&rsquo;t write coherent sentences, can&rsquo;t speak coherently without a teleprompter, announce that &#8220;white people do not have civil rights&#8221; and so-on.  These folks aren&rsquo;t infantile because some nasty conspiracy on the part of the educational, economic and criminal justice systems to &#8220;marginalize&#8221; them.  Threatts &amp; co. are infantile because they comes from a race of people whose average IQ is approximately 80.</p>
<p>For a more effective &#8220;fountain of youth&#8221;, the tried and true recipe is: eat right, get plenty of exercise, don&rsquo;t smoke or use hard drugs, drink in moderation, avoid heavy exposure to the sun, and keep a positive outlook on life.  No part of this involves behaving like a 14 year-old.  Wait a minute - this recipe calls for some self-restraint.  Never mind.  Move along; there&rsquo;s nothing to see here.<br>

<p>  They can lie through their teeth with such sincerity and force that you are goaded into believing them.  I have had two years worth of experience seeing this in action dozens of times.  They are not just smooth in getting white girls to be with them.  They are master fib-tellers also.</p>

<p>This one was able to keep the scam up for quite awhile.</p>
<p>This article does not state it, but he started a relationship with one of the girls in that high school while pretending to be 16.  It never said if the girl was white or black or something else.  Either way, this means that stat rape is now in the bundle of criminal charges.</p>

		<p>I am not a mental health expert, but it seems to me that Threatts suffers from mental illness. Unfortunately for him, the abiding commitment of the medical profession to political correctness often prevents Blacks from receiving the psychotherapeutic treatment they need. They are given treatment that would benefit Caucasians with their symptoms, not Blacks with those symptoms.</p>

<p>MUSLIMS lie better, their holy book says it is all right for them to lie to non muslims if it furthers the muslim agenda. BUT! of course, many blacks are converting to the muslim faith so it works out for them and they can then placy the religious card along with the race card now.</p>
