<h1>30,000 Line Up for Housing Vouchers, Some Get Rowdy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Morris and Rhonda Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, August&nbsp;11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thirty thousand people showed up to receive Section 8 housing applications in East Point Wednesday, suffering through hours in the hot sun, angry flare-ups in the crowd and lots of frustration and confusion for a chance to receive a government-subsidized apartment.</p>
<p>The massive event sometimes descended into a chaotic mob scene filled with anger and impatience. Some 62 people needed medical attention and 20 of them were transported to a hospital, authorities said. A baby went into a seizure in the heat and was stabilized at a hospital. People were removed on stretchers and when a throng of people who had been waiting hours in a line were told to move to another line, people started pushing, shoving and cursing, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Still, officials of East Point declared the day a success. Nobody was arrested and nobody was seriously injured, they said. It was an assessment roundly challenged by many of the people who had to go through it.</p>
<p>Kim Lemish, executive director of the East Point Housing Authority, said the event marked the first time the city has offered Section 8 housing applications since 2002. The waiting list that lasted eight years had depleted, she said, and the agency was beginning a new one. So people braved all the physical difficulties just to get on a waiting list that could keep them waiting for years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the crowd waited for two days at the Tri-Cities Plaza shopping center. As the temperature rose Wednesday, people fell ill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Felecia McGhee told the AJC she arrived around 6:30 a.m. Wednesday. She said the major problem began when people started breaking into the line and then officials handing out applications started moving those areas and those line breakers. She said she saw at least two small children trampled when the crowd rushed the building where the applications were to be handed out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Channel 2 Action News reporter Mike Petchenik  said fights were breaking out and police had to stop people who were storming the door.</p>
<p>Channel 2 reporter Tom Jones said, &#8220;There are thousands, I mean, thousands of people here. I&rsquo;ve seen people fall out from the heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>By late morning the crowd had thinned considerably and people were walking up and getting their applications without delay. But just before the 1 p.m. deadline, a line of about 200 people had formed. Shortly after 1 p.m., several people ran across the parking lot to get in line but were told by police that the line was closed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A sign on the door of the office explained that only applications were being handed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The housing authority will be issuing applications Wednesday, August 11, starting at 9 a.m. Everyone in line by 1 p.m. on the 11th will receive an application.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No Section 8 vouchers are available at this time. There are no public housing units available at this time. You&rsquo;re applying for the waiting list only.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Housing Choice Voucher Program, called Section 8, subsidized the rents of low-income families living in apartments and houses that are privately owned. The federal program makes up the difference in rent that the poor can afford and the fair market value for each area.</p>

		<p>Oh, boy, more section 8 recipients   &mdash;   moving into an apartment next to you!  There should be a law that section 8 vouchers can only be used in wealthy and upper middle class neighborhoods that vote at least 65% Democrat.  That&rsquo;s the only way to cure them.</p>
<p>For example, this is one home owner that would be <i>delighted</i> to have a dozen section 8 families move next door:</p>

		<p>Yeah, that is exactly what American pioneers wanted America to look like. 30 thousand blacks wanting the money of white people for housing.<br>
Even liberals have to realize that welfare is for 99 people pay in and one man is unable so shouldn&rsquo;t be left behind. But the system totally doesn&rsquo;t work if 50 percent pay in and 43 percent want only to live from that money.</p>

<p>This is the future of our once great homeland.  Just imagine 30 or 50 years from now when our population is 50% larger, cheap oil is depleted, our economy crashes, China reigns supreme, and all the freebies run out.  </p>
<p>We already saw what happened in New Orleans after just 3 days of no AC, no cold beer, no TV and no flush toilets.  Take a look at the above picture, and imagine cities with 3 to 5 million disaffected People of Color   &mdash;   hungry, hot, thirsty, and angry   &mdash;   People who have been told their entire lives that all of their problems are do to racist Whites.  The fact that you donated to the NAACP or that you once voted for Obama will not help you or your children one bit. </p>
<p>America is toast. </p>

		<p>In simplest terms, the welfare state is a scheme to get productive people to work harder to support unproductive people.</p>
<p>Landlords, social workers, police, corrections workers, members of the justice system, ambulance and first responders&hellip;. all paid by taxing the productive sector to look after the unproductive.</p>
<p>It is the reason for the unrestrained growth of government.  We have lost the ability to reign it in, and only a collapse will stop this madness. </p>

<p>So, the bare minimum of appropriate behavior was a success. Not that there were NO fights, No laws broken, or No body injured, but that nobody was arrested for fighting or lawless behavior, or SERIOUSLY injured. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m fairly liberal when it comes to the notion of safety nets for fellow citizens.</p>
<p>But this incident exposes one of the weaknesses or flaws in how Western multicultural societies implement their safety nets.</p>
<p>Simply put, ethnic/racial mistrust and resentment is a point of cleavage between the majority and minority that threatens the viability and legitimacy of such a system. </p>
<p>The minority groups overburden the system and use them disproportionately with the excuse that they deserve them because they&rsquo;re the minority. Sometimes the excuse is historically justified, but at least in the US, it isn&rsquo;t anymore. </p>
<p>On the other side, the majority ethnic/racial groups don&rsquo;t want to pay for minority, they see them as a burden and don&rsquo;t want to pay into the system because their members aren&rsquo;t getting any benefits from it.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of examples from history where racial and ethnic differences and mistrust have been set aside enough to establish systems where the common good of all comes first. If there are, I&rsquo;d love to hear about them.</p>
<p>Given that, I don&rsquo;t see this situation getting any better, especially as this country transitions into a minority-majority demographic mix. I predict there will be less and less willingness to pay into the system as it becomes clearer that some ethnic/racial groups are benefiting from govt services more than others.</p>
<p>To put all this another way, welfare states with generous safety nets like we see in Northern Europe work best in racially homogeneous countries.</p>

		<p>The local news coverage showed the typical black females screaming, cussing, pounding away at everyone, flailing and calling the event &#8216;barbaric&rsquo;, &#8216;like Katrina&rsquo;, and &#8216;treatin&rsquo; us like ANIMALS!&rsquo; This is my comment to the local NBC news affiliate home page article about the &#8216;incident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does it seem that much of the time someone is giving something away for free or almost free, it gathers a large, &#8216;less than diverse&rsquo; crowd? And it also seems that when there is a large gathering of a &#8216;less than diverse&rsquo; crowd, it ends up getting out of control with police, ambulances and the sanitation dept. required to regain order. Why is that? Is self control that difficult? One can almost always write the script.&#8221;</p>

Mike Morris is the notorious and extremist AJC reporter who refuses to put the race of crime suspects in his stories when the victim is a member of our White Humanity and the perp is a black.</p>
<p>I bet Mike Morris didn&rsquo;t choose the photos for this story.  Some &#8220;ignorant&#8221; editor who was &#8220;acting stupidly&#8221; must have committed this outrageous and unforgivable insensitivity against human dignity.  He&rsquo;s probably been called into an emergency meeting to discuss his career prospects in the journalism business. He&rsquo;ll next make his required visit to the local NAACP, SCLC, and ADL offices to grovel and apologize.  His career will be sunk anyway, so why bother?  We should all pitch in to send him a copy of Racism Schmacism.  <br>

		<p>As I have always said, section 8 NEEDS to be for the elderly and the disabled ONLY!  White ones, at that! It is mostly White tax dollars that pay for all these giveaways including welfare! No nation on earth can have a social security system, welfare system, food stamps etc when the country is loaded with nonwhites from the world over. WE all KNOW that, don&rsquo;t we?  If a country is not of your racial kindred then all will fail, including the whole nation. If we do not change this and pronto, then America is toast as one poster stated earlier.</p>

		<p>The problem is you always get more of what you subsidize. Try feeding a few birds and see what happens next week, and the week after that. You guessed it, you get more Democrats. When we have so many entitled people voting, and not working, guess who they will vote for.This balloon can only be inflated so much and then it will burst. Don&rsquo;t be living around any diversity when the checks start bouncing, it ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be pretty.</p>

		<p>Some great comments&hellip; check out WR the Elder&rsquo;s link! In response to Vick: welfare states do indeed seem to work best with ethnically homogeneous populations. They are falling apart in Scandinavia because of large-scale immigration and the growing reluctance of Scandinavians to support poor immigrants.</p>
<p>These pictures show that Section 8 is nothing less than &#8220;reparations&#8221;. We&rsquo;ve been paying for years. </p>

<p>Just wait until there is no food on the grocery shelves and government freebies are gone, because the government is out of money or it takes a wheelbarrow full of 100 dollar bills to buy a loaf of bread.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of stories of black behavior that come out of the Mississippi Delta.</p>
<p>I grew up in a farming family, and kept my auto insurance with an organization which insures farmers.  There are yearly association meetings.  Many members, or at least many of the insured, are black.</p>
<p>Cousins who actually go to the meetings told me about what it was like, once blacks started attending in significant numbers.  Mommas bringing every single last one of their offspring, to get their share of the refreshments.  Stampedes toward the refreshment tables, as if these people were actually starving.  Refreshments tables knocked over by overexcited blacks&hellip;.  We&rsquo;re talking very cheap Punch and even cheaper Cookies here, not Lobster and Champagne.  I&rsquo;m sure every one of those free-food mavens had better stuff at home.  But just the idea of FREE!</p>
<p>Then, we started getting our yearly announcements that the meeting would be held.  In the largest type on the page, would be something like: NO REFRESHMENTS WILL BE SERVED.</p>
<p>Everything they touch turns to&hellip;</p>
<p>But HEY!  Only two small children were trampled there in Atlanta.  So the day was a success!</p>

<p>To be completely fair, there&rsquo;s no work right now. That having been said, however, I seriously doubt that any of these people were much interested in working even when there was work</p>

		<p>I live north of Atlanta and saw this in the news yesterday. It&rsquo;s appalling that we have this many people who can&rsquo;t provide for themselves. I do think that many of them would rather work, but as <br>
Simon Jester said, there&rsquo;s not much work right now, and I doubt that these people have many skills. Our problem is that we&rsquo;ve produced/imported a large population without the skills/IQ required to sustain themselves in a modern society. This is a problem that has developed over generations since the 1960s, and it won&rsquo;t be solved quickly or easily. </p>

		<p>Lost in most discussions of Section 8 is who benefits from the program most, and it&rsquo;s far-and-away landlords. They get to charge more and receive a steady government check for housing that they can minimally maintain. In that way it&rsquo;s like the student-loan racket, in which ever more generous loans cause college tuition to rise and rise, while students take on ever more debt.</p>
<p>For that we can thank Jack Kemp. He correctly recognized that the chief misery of living in poverty in America is having to live among thugs and criminals, and set out to spread those folks as thin as possible across metro areas. This, along with immigrants in some places, devastated white lower-middle neighborhoods and suburbs. Guess where the landlords don&rsquo;t live?</p>
<p>Spreading them out has done, nothing, absolutely nothing to change behavior, except to degrade the behavior of today&rsquo;s white teenagers in those areas. That was the central fallacy of Kemp and his successor&rsquo;s thinking. Single-family, lower density neighborhoods are in a sense somewhat fragile in that they depend on every single resident to put effort into maintaining their own property and observing some basic rules of peace and quiet. Section 8 tenants manifestly do not fit in to this environment and it only takes one or two for a street to start to look &#8220;bad.&#8221; Multiply this across a region and you have whole neighborhoods, suburbs, and school districts going down. </p>
<p>And for what? So that the rude, grasping, touchy, and entitled masses can have a shot at living in your neighborhood without getting the education, saving the money, or doing the work to earn it. Way to go, Federal Gov&rsquo;t!  </p>

		<p>Forgot to clarify a point I made above, comparing Section 8 to student loans. Like the tuition increases, Section 8 raises the cost of lower-end housing for everyone, and makes housing less affordable, not more. It&rsquo;s only more &#8220;affordable&#8221; if you hold a certificate. This is Economics 101 FAIL on the part of the government.</p>

<p>True, and the other half of the equasion is that all jobs that required no schooling and only on the job training were sent overseas years ago. Those manufacturing jobs were a HUGE portion of America&rsquo;s economy, and thus, there IS nowhere for the average, American to work, since all other types of good jobs require a minimum of a college degree - which actually has nothing to do with the required qualifications for that job. It&rsquo;s only to weed out the undesireables. A grandson completed 4 years of college and was hired by a national insurance company as a property damage appraiser. What about that job needs a college degree? He was taught everything he needed to know about insurance adjusting and appraising by the company. Years ago that same job would be available to (and successfully accomplished by) a high school grad.</p>
<p>Bottom line is if we don&rsquo;t get back a lot of those jobs that our greedy tax policies, lobbyists and fat cat CEO&rsquo;s hurtled overseas, thumbing their noses at those employees that helped make them rich, there will never be more jobs. Something has to be created; manufactured and sold to create real jobs.</p>
<p>Having said that, it must be noted that the majority of the seething mass at that chance at a free giveaway in Atlanta would still be on the welfare rolls regardless. However, even taking 10-20% of them out of the &#8216;gimme&rsquo; category would help.</p>

		<p>Sadly, this shows why the South was so worried when the slaves were freed and why Jim Crow was instituted.  Even though there are many blacks who are hard-working and law-abiding, this large underclass represents a significant percentage that creates a hugely out-of-proportion amount of crime and social unrest.  And something I absolutely do blame almost all blacks for is that hardly a soul among them will publicly criticize these people.  Many complain among themselves or to trusted whites about the ghetto minions, but no wide outcry is heard by Americans in general.  Thus, low IQ blacks, hearing little or no condemnation of their attitudes and actions from prominent blacks and hearing nothing but excuses for them from liberal whites (who dominate the media) believe their behavior is fully justified.  Omar Thornton, instead of considering whether his failings were his own fault, no doubt justified job-quitting and stealing by mulling over and over the belief that whitey was at fault and he was simply evening the score by taking what was due him as a black man.  </p>

<p>Actually, there was a story on this on NBC news last night. However, as predicted, it was edited to shreds, to shed the &#8216;poor, under served, racially held-down &#8220;Americans who braved 3 days of 90+ heat with no shade just for the CHANCE at an opportunity for housing.&#8221; Quote/unquote.</p>
<p>But the national media failed to show at least 5 minutes of coverage that Atlanta media outlets did of the individual self-centered, dependent and uncontrolled blacks, screaming unintelligible jive, thrusting fists, wailing, shouting that they shouldn&rsquo;t have to live like this, and the ever present DEMANDING that they be given what others work for. They were pushing police, people passing infants overhead from one to another across 30 feet of swarming anger, punching, slapping, shoving, climbing on cars, and one (obese) black woman waiting with a Chick-Fil-A dinner box upside down on her head, supposedly to keep off the sun; and all of this with a sound level of a small football stadium. If more people outside the areas that actually live with this behavior could see the way they talk/feel/think/act on a daily basis, a bit of the tide would turn. But wealthy whites are so insulated from masses of them that they haven&rsquo;t got a clue.</p>

		<p>So 30,000 people who clearly didn&rsquo;t have to be at work somewhere, lined up for an application to get on a waiting list that was not expected to have more than 65 slots over the next 7 years.  That&rsquo;s 30,000 people who slept through math classes.  It amazes everyone to see blacks being blacks like this in America.  <br>

		<p>I have watched this behavior many many times. Blacks expending<br>
huge amounts of effort to avoid work I have watched blacks<br>
spent days avoiding 1 hour of work. They will be incredibly creative in making up excuses to avoid having to spend any<br>
mental effort on the job. In order to get something &#8220;free&#8221;<br>
they will do 10x the effort it would cost to simply work for it. Why did our ancestors ever think<br>
that blacks would be a source of cheap labor? </p>

		<p>   30,000 people without hats standing in the heat?  Let&rsquo;s apply some Yankee ingenuity to this situation:</p>
<p>   A 24 bottle case of water costs $6.00.  Sell them for $2.00 a bottle.  Sell a case every ten minutes for 8 hours and&hellip; VOILA!.. you don&rsquo;t need section 8 housing, you&rsquo;ve just made enough money in one day to pay for two months of rent.</p>
<p>   Of course, this wouldn&rsquo;t work in that situation.  You have to be motivated, friendly towards customers, good at handling money, full of ingenuity, and willing to hustle&hellip; basically, non-black.  The other problem is that the crowd would rob you blind and steal your water and your money&hellip;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it myself:  So many blacks working at a particular job will complain all day during the time they should be working about how hard their task ahead is going to be, or how hard they&rsquo;ve been working all day.  Okay&hellip;.so when are they going to start?  Seems to me the hardest work they do is running their mouths about how hard they work.</p>
<p>In a similar spirit, I&rsquo;ve heard blacks proclaim that &#8220;we&rsquo;z gotz to have six degrees&#8221; to get the same kind of employment offers that whites with one college degree would get.  Then they complain about how expensive is college tuition.  (As if I don&rsquo;t know any better about those affirmative action grants).  Then they&rsquo;ll admit that they didn&rsquo;t graduate from high school, ergo they didn&rsquo;t finish the highest level of education society would give them for practically no cost.</p>

		<p>Agree with poster 4, anonymous. The problems of maintaining order in the coming 20-30 years will dwarf everything else. China is, as the poster stated, going to win. Their cultural influence may have a positive effect on our country in the sense that ethnic cohesion will be seen for what it is, a requirement for economic strength; not sufficient but necessary.<br>
 Anxiety seeks out it own solution. For the present whites are still running away from blacks and I can only see that trend continuing. Browns are going to stand and fight for whatever they can get.<br>
However, only white/asian areas will see any economic growth of the modern kind. Blacks are doomed but a serious fight is in the offing.</p>

		<p>I blame this mess on the Housing Agency.  If the application process is only open once every eight years or so, why in the world would schedule this event for the MIDDLE OF AUGUST????</p>
<p>The sign that they put up on the door notified everybody that they were just applying for the waiting list, and that there were no actual vouchers currently available.  This free-for-all could have and should have been scheduled six weeks later in the year.</p>
<p>When I got divorced in California, I qualified for a voucher, but had to wait on a waiting list for close to three years.  It is a stupid system.  When you are desperate, the system gives you NOTHING.  Several years later, when you are employed and your children are older (lowering your childcare costs) they give you a benefit that is so generous that it is worthwhile to quit your job in order to hang on to it.</p>

<p>Your comment is precise, and also the reason why blacks in Africa never even thought up the wheel or the idea of a two story dwelling until Europeans did it. Any such building, built by the African blacks or the Arab muslims is suspect relative to the safety of said building.</p>

<p>&#8220;is is the future of our once great homeland. Just imagine 30 or 50 years from now when our population is 50% larger, cheap oil is depleted, our economy crashes, China reigns supreme, and all the freebies run out.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been harping on about this for years.  Look, I&rsquo;m no racist.  I believe in live and let live regardless of what you look like.</p>
<p>Where I draw the line is with letting your home (or country) go to ruin by letting in riff raff, no matter the source.  Look, America developed the most advanced culture, economy and way of life on the planet.  And we&rsquo;re just letting it go into the toilet for our children and grandchildren to live out some &#8216;social justice&rsquo; fantasy!</p>
<p>I am the descendant of five centuries worth of Europeans on this continent.  My ancestors paid in blood and sweat to make a country that got better and better each generation for their descendants.  Now we&rsquo;re all witnessing the reversal of that trend?  Are we (all whites regardless of political views) stupid!</p>
<p>As poster #4 said, in 30 years when we are a persecuted minority in our own homeland, living in fear from marauding bantus, brutal aztecas, crazy hmong hunters and home-bred chinese warlords, how will it be for us then?  Was this an improvement?  Will the dream of social justice be realized when whites are no longer powerful enough to shepherd it?</p>

		<p>Really, whose fault is it that we have so many Section 8 blacks, completely dependent for four or more generations on government entitlements, who feel they have a birthright to the fruits of your labor, feel the racist White-controlled  government &#8216;owes&rsquo; them for life, encouraged and rewarded to reproduce often and at will? </p>
<p>Is it the fault of the race hustlers like jack$on or $harpton who tell blacks they&rsquo;re still living under Jim Crow laws, that &#8216;things haven&rsquo;t changed since the 1940s&rsquo;, and that Whites get up every single morning, ponder and discuss around the breakfast table how to keep down &#8216;people of color?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Is it the schools that teach blacks from grade K onward that they are oppressed and &#8216;kept down, poor and in ghettos&rsquo;  by the Great White Bigot? That school failure is never their fault but rather a predictable outcome of being forced to cope with a racist White culture?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the the media that refuse to report vile black-on-White torture/murders such as happened in Wichita and present Whites as inhuman rapists, murderers and child abusers?</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s coming from a hostile elite that has taken control of the government, academia and media (and is working on the judiciary) and that the deteriorating situation we Whites find ourselves in is really not about blacks or other non-Whites at all  &mdash;  but primarily about a War on Whites with blacks in the role of useful idiots to carry out the Primary Goal, which is first, last and always the destruction of the White Race.</p>
<p>To me, that is what appears to be happening.</p>
<p>Non-Whites are being primed by the media and academia to view us as evil, as inhuman, as non-humans, as monsters, making our destruction easier at the hands of non-Whites.</p>

Social justice is a fantasy of Christianity, which sprang from white altruism. Altruism is a genetic trait and can grow or be extinguished, and rather quickly I surmise. Traits such as it are dependent on its favoring reproduction; it may prove disadvantageous - I think it does in a mixed population - so we can count on seeing it disappear. I refer you to Cochran and Harpending&rsquo;s work &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion&#8221; on mercurial genes.</p>
