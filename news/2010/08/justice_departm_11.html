<h1>Justice Department Seeks Ebonics Experts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Smoking Gun, August 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Department of Justice is seeking to hire linguists fluent in Ebonics to help monitor, translate, and transcribe the secretly recorded conversations of subjects of narcotics investigations, according to federal records.</p>
<p>A maximum of nine Ebonics experts will work with the Drug Enforcement Administration&rsquo;s Atlanta field division, where the linguists, after obtaining a &#8220;DEA Sensitive&#8221; security clearance, will help investigators decipher the results of &#8220;telephonic monitoring of court ordered nonconsensual intercepts, consensual listening devices, and other media&#8221;</p>
<p>The DEA&rsquo;s need for full-time linguists specializing in Ebonics is detailed in bid documents related to the agency&rsquo;s mid-May issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) covering the provision of as many as 2100 linguists for the drug agency&rsquo;s various field offices. Answers to the proposal were due from contractors on July 29.</p>
<p>In contract documents, which are excerpted here, Ebonics is listed among 114 languages for which prospective contractors must be able to provide linguists. The 114 languages are divided between &#8220;common languages&#8221; and &#8220;exotic languages.&#8221; Ebonics is listed as a &#8220;common language&#8221; spoken solely in the United States.</p>
<p>Ebonics has widely been described as a nonstandard variant of English spoken largely by African Americans. John R. Rickford, a Stanford University professor of linguistics, has described it as &#8220;Black English&#8221; and noted that &#8220;Ebonics pronunciation includes features like the omission of the final consonant in words like &#8216;past&rsquo; (pas&rsquo; ) and &#8216;hand&rsquo; (han&rsquo;), the pronunciation of the th in &#8216;bath&rsquo; as t (bat) or f (baf), and the pronunciation of the vowel in words like &#8216;my&rsquo; and &#8216;ride&rsquo; as a long ah (mah, rahd).&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the nine Ebonics experts, the DEA&rsquo;s Atlanta office also requires linguists for eight other languages, including Spanish (144 linguists needed); Vietnamese (12); Korean (9); Farsi (9); and Jamaican patois (4). The Atlanta field division, one of the DEA&rsquo;s busiest, is the only office seeking linguists well-versed in Ebonics. Overall, the &#8220;majority of DEA&rsquo;s language requirements will be for Spanish originating in Central and South America and the Caribbean,&#8221; according to one contract document.</p>

		<p>&#8220;a nonstandard variant of English spoken largely by African Americans&#8221;</p>
<p>NO! NOT a variant. A corrupted form that is not even quite often intelligible to the &#8220;native speakers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why do you think &#8220;ebonic&#8221;  speakers are so fond of saying: &#8220;yah know what a&rsquo;hm sayin&rsquo;?&#8221; They are not even sure themselves if they are being understood!</p>
<p>Most of the time, &#8220;ebonics&#8221; speakers have trouble communicating even with one another.</p>

		<p>Ebonics is kind of like &#8220;pidgin&#8221; English. It&rsquo;s not a legitimate language or dialect. It&rsquo;s just really, really bad grammar and pronunciation. On the other hand, there is some consistency amongst ebonics speakers and it is very difficult to understand if you&rsquo;re not familiar with it.</p>

<p>MOST if not all of the persons &#8220;fluent&#8221; in &#8220;ebonics&#8221; will NEVER be able to obtain a security clearance of any sort.</p>
<p>NOT able to obtain a clearance because of crimninal arrests, having fambly [ebonic spelling] members in prison, drug use, etc.</p>
<p>Same as with casino jobs. They build these casinos in areas where there is high unemployment [black areas] and hope that this will create jobs for the locals. MOST of the locals can never get a job at a casino, again, for the same reason, criminal arrests, drug use, etc.</p>
<p>And believe me, those casinos are very careful as to they hire. Their private security firms and PI&rsquo;s do a more thorough background check than the gov ever does.</p>

		<p>Having worked in the inner city for 30 years I used to be quite good at translating as well as speaking Ebonics.  Over the last 5 to 10 years, however, it seems that Ebonics is evolving even further away from standard English.  If I am right my guess would be that as cities have become more diverse, with blacks being exposed to more hispanic-English, Chinese-English and Indian/Pakistani-English and to less and less standard (white) American English, Ebonics is drifting further away from American English.</p>
<p>Blacks always devolve unless kept to a small minority and constantly exposed to civilization.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to wake up each morning and see what idiocy has happened overnight. Ebonics is not a language and it doesn&rsquo;t need a translator. It&rsquo;s just lazy English. Black students are Americans - no hyphenation - and they need to speak like the rest of the country. </p>

		<p>What surprises me is that a Justice Department, run by a black AG, appointed by a black President, is putting out the help wanted sign for ebonics speakers, because they need help monitoring the illicit narcotics trade.  Are they implying that there is a link between ebonics speakers and drug dealing and transporting?  Oh my, the anti-racist industry is going to go to town on that one&hellip;</p>

		<p>This an incredible employment opportunity!  Anybody who can speak totally ungrammatical English, with totally butchered syntax and pronunciation, qualifies for a high-paying government job.  All one need do is to cultivate a vocabulary of three hundred English words and mispronounce them in an easy-to-learn manner, which can be accomplished by watching any black sit-com.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m normally opposed to anything that attempts to lend legitimacy to ebonics/african-american vernacular english/lazy baby-talk/whatever, but this is an exception.  A tool like this that aids law enforcement in getting criminals off the streets is something to be supported, as odd as it may seem.</p>
<p>There is a positive side effect here as well.  The fact that the DEA must hire a number of translators to help agents understand black criminals is a defacto admission of who is commiting the lion&rsquo;s share of drug crimes.</p>

		<p>We should promote ebonics as a true language and encourage its usage.</p>
<p>Blacks should not be allowed to speak our White language, which we gave to them for free, without our permission.  They don&rsquo;t need our permission to speak their africanized version of what they got from us.  The more unintelligible, the better.  Every ebonics speaking genuine, authentic, diverse black is an indictment against the egalitarians who demand that we sacrifice for the uplift of blacks.     We have an opportunity to look to White liberal elites and ask them to approve of ebonics.  If they don&rsquo;t, they are racists. If they do, then their argument that we &#8220;need to do more&#8221; to make blacks act like White Humanity falls flat. </p>
<p>Ebonics reinforces to all who hear it that &#8220;All Men Are Not Equal, and Never Will Be, So We Can Now All Stop Paying for the Lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want blacks talking my White language like a White person.  I&rsquo;m tired of how far they&rsquo;ve come by imitation.  I want them to be the real thing, out open, for all to see.   </p>
<p>I deeply mistrust these articulate talking blacks on TV. Sort of the way sensible Whites deeply mistrusted outsider ethnic groups who would get baptized in Christian churches. and then go home and pray to their own gods.  The baptisms were just a cover to deflect suspicion and to insinuate themselves into the dominant group by deception so that they could work another scam.  Same with blacks.  The proof is all around you.<br/>

		<p>This is not exactly brand new. My mom had a cousin who was assigned to oversee a bunch of military stevedores in WWII because he could speak and understand gullah. This relative spent a fair amount of time along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina during the 1930&rsquo;s and picked up the language. On a positive note, he spent the entire war stateside and had pretty much a 9 - 5 type of schedule.</p>
<p>Would whites be considered for this job now? How much difference would there be between say Philly &amp; New Orleans Ebonics? I went to a high school that was 75% black, maybe I could pass the language test? </p>

		<p>This is how languages mutate and become new languages.  (Ever wonder at all the variations on old &#8216;High&rsquo; German, such as Dutch, English, Danish, etc&hellip;?)</p>
<p>In 100 years time, when America has disunited into a fragmented continent with many nations, languages, races and cultures, it will resemble Europe or India in the vast array of differences.</p>
<p>Ebonics, which will have several regional variants, will be the official language in the 5-10 black nations that will arise from the ashes of this one great land.</p>

		<p>Back in 1997, the Oakland CA schoolboard decided that students should be taught in Ebonics instead of standard English. Their rationale was that this sub-standard dialect used by many blacks had a &#8220;genetic&#8221; basis. And I suspect they&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ve noticed that American born Orientals have voices that are virtually indistinguishable from US born whites and they rarely (if ever) use improper grammar typical like so many blacks. While many  mestizos and Amerindians speak in a rough, urban sounding accent, those fluent in English tend not to make the silly kinds of grammatical mistakes that blacks so often do.  I suspect that Ebonics is a result of the lower average IQ of blacks and the fact that fact that they may lack speech genes which are found in virtually all non-Africans. Just a speculation.</p>
