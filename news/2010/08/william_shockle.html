</table>William Bradford Shockley was, at the time of his death in 1989, perhaps the most reviled man in America. His public image, created by a relentlessly hostile press, was that of a mad scientist, firmly in the service of evil. His crime was not merely to have publicized unacceptable views on race, intelligence, and genetics, but to have lent them the prestige of a Nobel laureate in physics.</p>
<p><cite>Shockley on Eugenics and Race,</cite> edited by Dr.&nbsp;Roger Pearson, is a collection of Dr.&nbsp;Shockley&rsquo;s papers written from 1965 to 1975. This was the very decade during which leftist-egalitarian thinking was tightening its grip on the country. It is hazardous enough today to preach heresy on the subject of race and intelligence, but to have done so when Dr.&nbsp;Shockley was most active was to court assassination.</p>
<p>It was only due to Dr.&nbsp;Shockley&rsquo;s prominence as a scientist that he was able to get a hearing at all. After receiving his Nobel prize in 1956 for leading the team that invented the transistor, Dr.&nbsp;Shockley founded one of the first high-technology companies in Silicon Valley and was appointed a professor at Stanford University. When, in 1965, he began to preach eugenic heresies, his views hit the country like a bomb.</p>
<p><b>The Future of Man</b></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Shockley&rsquo;s main concerns can be quickly summarized. The best available evidence suggested to him that mankind faced a serious dysgenic threat. The least intelligent were reproducing much more quickly than the most intelligent, and this backward evolution threatened the very basis of civilization. Even more provocative was his view that blacks were devolving more rapidly than whites, since low-IQ blacks were outbreeding high-IQ blacks more rapidly than low-IQ whites were outbreeding high-IQ whites. Furthermore, since blacks were devolving from a lower average IQ to begin with, they faced the prospect of serious, permanent degeneration.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Dr.&nbsp;Shockley never claimed that he had <em>proven</em> that any of this was happening. All he asked was that the nation seriously investigate questions of heredity, intelligence and demographic trends. If Dr.&nbsp;Shockley were proven right then the nation could decide what should be done. If he were shown to be wrong, he would offer a graceful retraction.</p>
<p>The forum in which Dr.&nbsp;Shockley most vigorously pressed his case for research was the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). As a member of the Academy he had the right to propose research projects and he did so every year from 1967 to 1972. Some of the most interesting papers in this collection are proposals to the NAS.</p>
<p>It is not hard to imagine the reception they received. As Prof. Arthur Jensen of the University of California at Berkeley points out in his preface to this book, Dr.&nbsp;Shockley was not a diplomat. Both in speech and in writing his aim was precision, rather than what we today call &#8220;sensitivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his second research proposal to the Academy he urged it to &#8220;inquire into ways to determine how many probable misfits regardless of race will be born into our potentially great society as a result of present population patterns.&#8221; In the same proposal he tackled the race question head-on, pointing out that to blame all the failures of black people on racism was a misdiagnosis of the problem. &#8220;I sincerely and thoughtfully believe,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;that my current attempts to demonstrate that American Negro shortcomings are preponderantly hereditary is the action most likely to reduce Negro agony in the future.&#8221; In other words, if dysgenics were the problem, it could be solved through eugenics.</p>
<p>This sort of thing was much too racy for the NAS and it turned down Dr.&nbsp;Shockley&rsquo;s proposals year after year. Eventually, the great physicist lost patience. He had repeatedly warned the Academy that if differential birth rates really had thrown evolution into reverse, it was a catastrophe that required immediate attention. In his last proposal to the NAS in 1972, he called the Academy&rsquo;s inaction &#8220;the most serious and obvious dereliction of intellectual responsibility in the history of science.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>It is clear from his papers that for Dr.&nbsp;Shockley, it was the sacred duty of scientists to search for the truth no matter how painful the truth might be. He often told his fellow scientists that &#8220;the courage to doubt in the face of the desire to believe is the true mark of the scientist&#8221; and reminded them of the <em>moral</em> obligation to think. Many of Dr.&nbsp;Shockley&rsquo;s colleagues did think, and privately encouraged him, but only a few were willing to lend him public support.</p>
<p>As Dr.&nbsp;Pearson points out in his introduction to this collection, Dr.&nbsp;Shockley knew that research of the kind he thought vital to the nation&rsquo;s future would never be possible if the media persisted in calling it &#8220;fascist&#8221; and &#8220;Nazi.&#8221; As he found himself spending more and more time fending off charges of &#8220;racism,&#8221; he began blaming &#8220;inverted liberals&#8221; who supported &#8220;unsearch&#8221; rather than research. He feared that those who thought they were helping blacks by opposing race-related research were the worst culprits. &#8220;If such effects [dysgenic trends among blacks] are occurring and if entrenched dogmatism is blocking their discovery,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;then the consequence may be a cruel form of genetic enslavement.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Thought Experiments</b></p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Shockley never made formal policy proposals, but some of the &#8220;thought experiments&#8221; he suggested in his papers come very close. The best known was the $1,000 Bonus Proposal. Anyone of childbearing age would be offered $1,000 for every IQ point under 100 if he agreed to be sterilized. Dr.&nbsp;Shockley even suggested that for people too stupid to learn about the bonus, &#8220;bounty hunters&#8221; could be rewarded for calling it to their attention.</p>
<p>The Deci-Child Certificate Plan is less well known. First, all women would be made sterile at an early age by contraceptive implant. At the same time, each woman would be issued a number of deci-child certificates, according to the average number of children society had determined would be best for the country. If that number were 2.2 per woman, then all women would be issued 22 deci-child certificates.</p>
<p>A married woman would be able to turn in ten certificates to have the implant removed for long enough to have one child. She could turn in ten more if she wanted another child. Women who did not want to have children could sell their certificates on the open market, so if a woman wanted five children she would have to buy extra certificates. If a woman were sure she was going to be a nun she could sell her certificates as soon as they were issued. Dr.&nbsp;Shockley thought that under such a plan only people who wanted and could afford them would have children.</p>
<p><b>The Scientific Mind</b></p>
<p>The papers in this book were not written for publication in a single volume so they sometimes cover the same ground. This can be irritating, but it does highlight the ideas that Dr.&nbsp;Shockley himself thought vital.</p>
<p>At the same time, one of the most edifying aspects of reading these papers is to see how a man with a rigorously scientific mind approached subjects that are usually governed by pure emotion. Often he stated the reasons for his views as a series of postulates, and whenever he took a position he gave clear reasons for it. But even when he was not being explicitly scientific, his formulations were often much more provocative than anything ordinarily found in the social sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nature,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;has color-coded groups of individuals so that statistically reliable predictions of their adaptability to intellectually rewarding and effective lives can easily be made and profitably be used by the pragmatic man-in-the-street.&#8221; In other words, judgments based on race are meaningful, and it would be foolish not to make them.</p>
<p>On eugenics, he wrote: &#8220;To me, it seems immoral not to view with concern, and perhaps not to try to prevent the birth of human beings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. forced by the improvidence of their mothers and the obtuseness of society to emerge into the world .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so disadvantaged by an unfair shake from a badly loaded parental genetic dice cup.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>Finally, even though he was an atheist, Dr.&nbsp;Shockley had a conception of the purpose of life that he recommended to believers and agnostics as well: &#8220;During the last rational five minutes of my life, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hope to consider that by demanding objective inquiry and open discussion of human quality problems I have used my capacities in keeping with the objective .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of conferring greatest benefit on humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Shockley believed that his eugenics work was much more important than the discovery of the transistor. As he explained, without a certain level of human intelligence, there could be no transistors or much else, for that matter. This collection of Dr.&nbsp;Shockley&rsquo;s papers gives us more than enough to conclude that his last five rational minutes were probably just as he had hoped they would be.

		<p>Hard-core racists sometimes say black folks have an inability to focus on long term gains focusing instead on a short term payoff. The reaction to Shockley proves this is completely wrong. This is a mental defect that instead afflicts the most educated liberal. Apparently the immediate pleasure of calling someone a &#8216;racist&rsquo; is just too sweet an apple to resist even at the risk of putting mankind&rsquo;s future in jeopardy. </p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that even more extreme birth control than that proposed by Shockley is completely acceptable, as long as liberal social workers are behind it. Girls across the country were infected with &#8216;Norplant&rsquo; a one time procedure designed to keep them getting pregnant for 5 years. This wasn&rsquo;t a &#8216;bigoted&rsquo; theory it was a &#8216;medical&rsquo; procedure. As long as the &#8216;people who care&rsquo; are behind it, it&rsquo;s A-Ok to do it, and even bigotry to dare and oppose it. </p>

		<p>It is interesting that Mike Judge&rsquo;s movie &#8216;Idiocracy&rsquo; presents many of Shockley&rsquo;s ideas in comic form, which allows people to discuss this situation more frankly.  I&rsquo;ve been surprised by how many people have begun to think about inherited intelligence because of this movie&rsquo;s popularity.  Mike Judge has a degree in physics so Shockley&rsquo;s eugenics work could very well have inspired &#8216;Idiocracy.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;In the same proposal he tackled the race question head-on, pointing out that to blame all the failures of black people on racism was a misdiagnosis of the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughably, I once shocked a colleague to the very core of his being, by plainly writing (in red ink) something aggressively negative about &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; on a proposal he was going to submit, justifying the continued employment of psychologists in the agency we worked for and he had asked me to review. He wrote something along these lines: &lsquo;Psychologists can also serve both in the workplace and toward our clients&rsquo; needs, by pointing out the destructive nature of white privilege and the damage it does to our system…&rsquo; </p>
<p>My response, in reviewing this portion of his proposal was: &ldquo;Appalling Marxist nonsense, &lsquo;white privilege&rsquo; so called, is a foolish and utopian concept that excuses the pathologies of minorities and blames the larger and successfully functioning society for them…&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then drew an X through that portion of his proposal and wrote &ldquo;remove this,&rdquo; across that X.</p>
<p>We debated for a bit over lunch on this topic that day, with him not gaining any ground over my position on this idiotic multicultural construct. When we were done, he said we needed to discuss this again and he hinted that he would &ldquo;convince&rdquo; me about &ldquo;how misunderstanding of the concept,&rdquo; I was. He never did, the issue was dropped and while he did include some minor multicultural nonsense in his proposal, he dropped the abhorrently Red &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; rubbish. </p>
<p>Oddly, we remain friends to this day. He was specialized in cult deprogramming (a fact which I knew) and I kept pointing out the cultist aspects within multiculturalism when I made my points over our lunch. </p>
<p>There are some details left out here, but that above is the synopsis of what took place.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

		<p>As a former lifelong liberal and denier of racial difference, I have to say that VIRTUALLY ALL liberals know deep down that low cognitive ability (and not discrimination) is by far the most serious problem facing Africans and African-Americans, and they denounce people like Shockley all the more vehemently because he is saying out loud what the secretly believe - to their shame. </p>
<p>I always tell my white liberal friends that their denial of the real issue facing blacks - cataclysmically low and DECLINING average intelligence - makes them the worst enemy of blacks. </p>
<p>That makes them angry, of course. </p>
<p>But how to break the taboo?</p>
<p>It would take a large number of scientists with impeccable credentials to take a public stand and refuse to back down no matter what.</p>
<p>At present, there barely a handful of scientists worldwide with that kind of integrity. </p>

<p>That was a great point. All Shockley did was address difficult truths that are going to have to be discussed eventually, no matter what. Ignoring them is not going to make them go away, it will only make them worse. The current idea that we can ignore racial differences in average IQ forever is pure nonsense. The longer we try to ignore them, the more likely they are to explode in our face.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;has color-coded groups of individuals so that statistically reliable predictions of their adaptability to intellectually rewarding and effective lives can easily be made and profitably be used by the pragmatic man-in-the-street.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Nature is parsimonious, and it never does anything without a good reason. We color-code files according to their importance. We color-code counties on a map to differentiate them. Yet we are told that differences between races are &#8220;merely&#8221; a matter of skin color! </p>
<p>Nature does not divide the races of man into different groups and provide them with markedly different characteristics for no good reason. The reason is to allow each race to explore its own destiny in the territory that nature has provided for it.</p>

		<p>Charles Darwin was saying much the same thing some 150 years ago yet Darwin is still taught in our schools and gererally revered as a great scientist. In fact Darwinism is rammed down our kids throats, that is except for the &#8220;offending&#8221; parts. I think there is a severe case of double standards here.</p>

		<p>This is all rather strange. Shockley defined the problem correctly, but his solution recipes were rather outlandish. <br/>
I suppose that Shockley might have been a bit Asperger, not quite grasping how normal people tick. The deci-child vouchers are complete nonsense - that&rsquo;s an attempt at a pure social engineering which usually fails. Fortunately. <br/>
The attempt at limiting kid number to 1 was done in China in a large scale experiment. It was called totalitarian (which it was) and it presents quite a problem from the point of view of a population balance - in the culture favoring sons (for these should care about their parents) this measure led under the harsh conditions imposed to having hundreds of thousands young men without hope to find a bride. Any bride - because many of these were quite spoiled only kids and the recent generation of Chinese girls does not see their fate anymore in getting married and caring for in-laws.</p>

		<p>Shockley basically said what the educated have been writing for centuries  &mdash;  that blacks are intellectually inferior.  The ancients penned the same findings.  Lincoln and Jefferson thought the same, the latter stating that any smart black had white blood.  With the civil rights revolution, it apparently became necessary to convince the general public that the great thinkers of the past were simply mistaken.  Africa didn&rsquo;t advance because it was isolated and unable to exchange ideas and technology with others  &mdash;  or Africa DID have great civilizations, the existence of which have been lost to time  &mdash;  or whites pretended that blacks were intellectually inferior in order to enslave them  &mdash;  or whatever excuse is fashionable.  When I was very young, it was possible to believe that blacks had just never been given a chance.  Well, now they have, with perks included, but statistically few  &mdash;  mostly mulattoes  &mdash;  have advanced.  </p>
<p>People in the ghetto are, as Shockley puts it, devolving.  There is less and less infusion of genes of either whites or smarter blacks.  The sexual revolution has made it possible for both latter groups to find casual sex outside the lower classes, and the ghettoes are growing increasingly dangerous.  Abortion, disease, and murder are rampant there.  These people are, in my opinion, on an evolutionary dead-end course.  </p>
<p>As to another statement of Shockley&rsquo;s, I wonder who the &#8220;inverted liberals&#8221; were to whom he referred.  Years ago, homosexuals were referred to as inverts and, today, provide strong monetary and moral support for far-left causes.<br/>
  <br/>
Dismayingly, even right-wing pundits like Krauthammer have given in and thrown their support to same-sex marriage.  It&rsquo;s as though the elitists are evolving into one solid core that opposes the wishes of the majority.  But they don&rsquo;t represent us.  Don&rsquo;t think for a moment that they do.<br/>

		<p>Dealing with this problem will fall to East Asians, of whom there are many, and who aren&rsquo;t about to allow themselves to be displaced or inbred with black Africans.  They consider us inferior and Africans sub-human.  Ultimately, how they deal with them likely will, by any standard, be considered drastic.</p>

<p>This might not work on a purely intellectual level, but I think people should subscribe to the paper edition of AR just for the cover article of the most recent issue, the first page of which you can read on the website.  It&rsquo;s about a typical white suburbanite who goes to work in Harlem to &#8220;save the children,&#8221; to show &#8220;moral superiority&#8221; over those racist white bigots, and &#8220;to make a difference.&#8221;  The results were predictable.</p>

		<p>Eugenics or (of) &#8216;good birth&rsquo; is, by nature, multigenerational.  Negative Eugenics is not which means you can lose large quantities of good or bad gene pool, very quickly.</p>
<p>The real question here is whether you -want- a smart black/hispanic/white and if not, why not.  Is it because your ancestors brought you to this plateau because they made the right choices (brains over brawn or beauty) and lived to tell their kids about it?  i.e.  Are you effectively telling X that their children don&rsquo;t deserve what he and his parents&rsquo; parents did not look to achieve?</p>
<p>Or is it something related to not wanting to have someone who looks ugly/strange/unique to your eyes competing with or making children with -your- genetic donais, simply because they &#8216;have met white standards&rsquo; for IQ and social conformism?</p>
<p>Either one has a justifiable basis for the prejudice.  Creating undue competition for your descendants or making them less selectively attractive because of a physical phenotype which does not reflect the &#8216;quality of their character&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Either way, were we to cut and splice the preexisting allele groups of &#8216;advantaged&rsquo; populations&rsquo; (East Asians, Parsi, Jews) best individuals; we could easily increase cranial vault volumes, modify the myelin, change the corpus collosum and improve the functionality of the prefrontal cortex inhibitor to both speed neural networking and apply more certain (social conformity) rule sets to -any- person&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<p>If you add to this Exogenics (which would almost certainly be needed anyway to monitor and control the epigenetic scriptors) so that women could no longer demand social privileges for a pain that they no longer had to undergo, and the &#8216;eugenics&rsquo; factors would largely be restricted to how many genius&rsquo; we could afford in a nation which already does not wish to do ditch digger manual labor.</p>
<p>Would the followon to &#8216;deci credits&rsquo; be one of bidding on manager or scientific level (140 and 160 or above IQ) vs. a social &#8216;card folding&rsquo; for a certain threshold of compensation like a house or a job for life among those poor slobs stuck with a 110-120 normed capability?</p>
<p>IMO, one of the great driving factors for prejudicial bias is it&rsquo;s ability to continue to allow races to succeed or perish based on a historical set of gains that may or may not (White: Warrior/Explorer/Builder genes) be applicable anymore.</p>
<p>While the ultimate &#8216;multicult&rsquo; problem of contemporary genomic vs. eugenic science is the ability to buy your kids past that evolutionary precondition on a genetics driven fast track.</p>
<p>Do we take the high road on a certainty of creating more genius from among all cultures with the means to acce$$ it?  Or do we obey a primitive understanding of &#8216;as it is, so shall we judge&rsquo; eugenic definitions of racial capability and thus create tiny enclaves of white elites as a residual gene group amongst a horde of other races.  Races to whom we presumably deny our own social values.  But not necessarily those of other genetics interested nations like China.</p>

		<p>I think one of the things that are wrong with America, these days, is that this man, a genius who did so much for his country, and created a device that has changed the world, died with most people not even knowing who he was, while so many millions of White kids in the U.S. worship Black NBA basketball stars and semi-literate &#8220;gangsta&#8221; rappers&hellip;</p>
<p>I think America, as a society, needs to think what kind of values it wants to promote.</p>

		<p>Until we have a new constitution that eliminates absurdities like the Fourteenth Amendment and specifically rejects the metaphysical natural law nonsense that &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221;, nothing will be done in the US. As for our Mother Country Britiain, and our cousin Canada, they are too busy throwing white people out of colleges so blacks from Africa can obtain college degrees.  Shockley is a saint, but many saints suffer ignoble deaths, and are remembered by a small minority of the faithful.  The majority care nothing for improvement of the the white race or of civilization. They want more parking spaces at the mall and they want the feds to pay for everything that is wrong in their empty lives.</p>

		<p>It is natural for one to allow one&rsquo;s likes and dislikes to influence one&rsquo;s judgment of what is true and false.  The very different Nazi and civil rights movements lead liberals to dislike any explanation of human behavior and potential that emphasized the importance of genes and innate differences.  <br/>
 <br/>
Because liberals cannot prove their theories about the irrelevance of genes, and because they secretly doubt them, they suppress a public, candid discussion of this issue. Unfortunately, conservatives have let them get away with it.  </p>

		<p>The typical stereotype of the White trailer trash with 10 kids is just that, a stereotype.  Maybe in Shockley&rsquo;s days it was true that less intelligent Whites were outbreeding the more intelligent ones but that&rsquo;s certainly not true now.  Fertility rates are practically the same across the board no matter the socio-economic status or intelligence. The threat is coming from the rapidly growing black, brown and yellow populations, much of it imported into our country.  </p>

		<p>It is a tragedy that a problem that could have been solved with scalpels and implants in Dr. Shockley&rsquo;s day will have to be dealt with by far more severe means in the near future. If America is ever to retain its former glory, the morons, imbeciles and idiots that have been deemed our equal by our leaders will have to be eliminated by any solution at at our disposal.<br/>
Contrary to the bleeding heart claim that racism is the result of ignorance, more often than not, nowadays, racism is the result of knowledge. Busing, affirmative action, Section 8 housing supplements and other forms of forced integration have spread race knowledge to every level of our society. As a result of that widespread knowledge, I believe that solutions to the dysgenic threat that were stunningly unacceptable to Whites the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s will seem far more reasonable to a nation that includes 100 million &#8220;White Flighters&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>It is interesting that Mike Judge&rsquo;s movie &lsquo;Idiocracy&rsquo; presents many of Shockley&rsquo;s ideas in comic form, which allows people to discuss this situation more frankly. I&rsquo;ve been surprised by how many people have begun to think about inherited intelligence because of this movie&rsquo;s popularity. Mike Judge has a degree in physics so Shockley&rsquo;s eugenics work could very well have inspired &lsquo;Idiocracy.&rsquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think you missed the point of the movie idiocracy.  This movie is what a specific minority that it&rsquo;s not popular to mention on Amren intends for us.  It&rsquo;s how they see white people (as lumped in with blacks and mestizos).  They envision a future where one of them, rules over us, so dumbed down they have no choice but to make him (or rather them) our leader(s).  His choice of mate is also very telling about their morals&hellip;.a literal prostitute of in-determinant racial background.</p>
<p>Better wake up.  They feel so secure in what they intend that they feel they can rub it in our faces and people won&rsquo;t figure it out.</p>
<p>Are they right?</p>
