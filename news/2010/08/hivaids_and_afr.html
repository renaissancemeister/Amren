<h1>HIV/AIDS and African Americans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, August 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States, HIV and AIDS have hit African Americans the hardest. The reasons are not directly related to race or ethnicity, but rather to some of the barriers faced by many African Americans. These barriers can include poverty (being poor), sexually transmitted diseases, and stigma (negative attitudes, beliefs, and actions directed at people living with HIV/AIDS or directed at people who do things that might put them at risk for HIV).</p>
<p>When we look at HIV/AIDS by race and ethnicity, we see that African Americans have</p>
<p>* <b>More illness. </b>Even though blacks (including African Americans) account for about 13% of the US population, they account for about half (49%) of the people who get HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p>* <b>Shorter survival times. </b>Blacks with AIDS often don&rsquo;t live as long as people of other races and ethnic groups with AIDS. This is due to the barriers mentioned above.</p>
<p>* <b>More deaths. </b>For African Americans and other blacks, HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death.</p>
<p>As the pie chart below shows, in 2005, about half (49%) of the people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were black (according to information from 33 states). Children are included in these data.</p>

</div>
<p>The reality is similar for children: HIV/AIDS affects black children the most. In 2005, 104 (63%) of the 166 children under the age of 13 diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 33 states were black.</p>
<p>As the pie charts below show, blacks account for about half of all people living with HIV/AIDS within each sex category. According to information from 33 states, during 2005,</p>
<p>* among men, 41% of men living with HIV/AIDS were black<br>
* among women, 64% of  women living with HIV/AIDS were black</p>

<p>For black men, the most common ways of getting HIV are (in order)</p>
<p>1. having unprotected sex with another man who has HIV<br>
2. sharing injection drug works (like needles or syringes) with someone who has HIV<br>
3. having unprotected sex with a woman who has HIV</p>
<p>For black women, the most common ways of getting HIV are (in order)</p>
<p>1. having unprotected sex with a man who has HIV<br>
2. sharing injection drug works (like needles or syringes) with someone who has HIV</p>
<p>Blacks at higher risk for HIV are those</p>
<p>* who are unaware of their partner&rsquo;s risk factors<br>
* with other STDs (which affect more blacks than any other racial or ethnic group)<br>
* who live in poverty (which is about one quarter [25%] of all blacks)</p>

<p>So they give us a stack of statistics based on race and ethnicity, but then warn us that those statistics have nothing to do with race or ethnicity.  Uh-huh.  Welcome to the Marxist Wonderland, where down is up, night is day and black is beautiful.</p>
<p>Odd, isn&rsquo;t it, that the categories aren&rsquo;t broken down by sexual preference as well?  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;These barriers can include poverty (being poor)&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Say, thanks for explaining that &#8220;poverty&#8221; means &#8220;being poor.&#8221;  I was pretty confused by that one.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;know, in my younger years, I was pretty poor myself, and yet somehow it never gave me AIDS.  I never knew what a close call I had.</p>
<p>How can even the most brainwashed governmedia stooges read this nonsense with a straight face?<br>

<p>No, it can&rsquo;t be that because everyone knows that AIDS is not a gay disease.</p>

		<p>Transmission of Aids/HIV is a behavioral.  We know how to prevent it, wear a condom.<br>
Perhaps Blacks are more susceptible to certain diseases, but our sensitivities will not permit that to explore.  Much to the detriment of Blacks.</p>

		<p>This silly argument is so muddled that it can&rsquo;t even be called circular!  It lists &#8220;barriers&#8221; that somehow cause blacks to become HIV infected.  The first, poverty, could conceivably do it.  Maybe not being able to afford condums, for instance, is a barrier to guarding oneself against HIV.  Number Two on the list is STD&rsquo;s.  Yes, already being infected with some other social disease can lower immunity and cause sores that could make one more likely to get HIV.  But how is it a barrier?  Then, Number Three, prejudice against HIV carriers, somehow causes people to become infected?  <br>
Blacks get HIV because both men and women are engaging in sodomy and shooting up with infected needles.  Is it because they&rsquo;re black?  Maybe not.  Maybe it&rsquo;s because 20% of them have low IQ&rsquo;s and no moral values whatsoever.</p>

		<p><i>These barriers can include poverty (being poor)</i></p>
<p>How does poverty make one a higher risk to contract HIV/AIDS?  Perhaps such people can&rsquo;t pony up the $6.38 for a box of condoms, BUT&hellip;in many places where blacks live, condom distribution is free for all intents and purposes.  Heck, the blacks in D.C. complained about cheap generic condoms being handed out for free, so therefore the &#8220;cash strapped&#8221; city government started buying Trojans (&#8220;shiny bling like wrappers&#8221;).  Somehow, though, D.C. gets to buy condoms for 6 to 9 cents per unit, depending on size.  That $6.38 divided by 24 comes to 26.5 cents per   &mdash;   why can&rsquo;t I get them that cheap?</p>

		<p> Here&rsquo;s a bit of advice for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention: Quit trying to pretend that some kind of malignant, irresistible forces entirely beyond blacks&rsquo; control are causing them to be hugely over-represented among HIV/AIDS victims. That huge disparity is because blacks as a group tend to be the most irresponsible, self-indulgent segment of our society.</p>
<p> HIV/AIDS can be prevented by taking the proper precautions. Far too many blacks don&rsquo;t bother. They want what they want, when they want it, and damn the consequences, which can always be blamed on &#8220;White racism&#8221; later. Until the black community starts taking a lot more responsibility for its own welfare than it has to date, it will get precious little sympathy from me.</p>

		<p>Um, there is no way that poverty causes HIV.  I can think of about a dozen places purely off the top of my head where I could go get 50 free condoms this evening.  Maybe it&rsquo;s a gay guy thing, because I can tell you as a straight female, that a man would spend his last five bucks on condoms if that meant he would get sex.  </p>
<p>People who don&rsquo;t have safe sex do so because THEY DO NOT WANT TO!  How complicated is this?  There is no such think is safe sex being unaffordable in the US.  It is simply not true.  </p>

		<p>How long do we have to endure hearing that blacks are unfairly suffering the consequences of their own irresponsible and all too often criminal behavior?  These commentaries are invariably couched in the context that they&rsquo;re victims.  Well, in a sense they are.  They&rsquo;re victims of their own irresponsibility, low intelligence, violent nature, and inability to adapt to a modern social and economic environment. They belong back on the plains of the Serengeti.  There&rsquo;s no place for them in the modern world.</p>

		<p>No one has mentioned another reason for the high HIV rates, incarceration.  And when they are out, they don&rsquo;t stop,they go on the DL, down low.  That&rsquo;s the reason for the high rates for black women.  Condoms would solve this whole issue.  But that would take a modicum of responsibility.<br>

		<p>The Canadian media reported on this story, with a curious twist.</p>
<p>They differentiated the occurances in Canada and the United States by stating that immigrants &#8220;from sub-Saharan Africa&#8221; were more likely to be afflicted with AIDS in Canada, while &#8220;African Americans&#8221; were more likely to have it in the U.S.</p>
<p>Like good liberals who deny what is in front of them, they couldn&rsquo;t bring themselves to state the obvious - that both groups are the same race, and that may have something to do with it.</p>

		<p>The funny thing that always goes unmentioned in the MSM is that AIDS is a blood transferred disease, like someone earlier mentioned the majority of this occurs from rapes during incarceration and of course drug use.</p>
<p>While not impossible its pretty difficult to get AIDS from normal male/female intercourse, the fact that blood needs to be transferred is the main reason that AIDS hasn&rsquo;t wildly spread like other STD&rsquo;s (herpes, Gonohrrea etc.)</p>

		<p>After having worked with black youth for several years now, I can say that the primary cause of many of their ills is no functioning culture of self-denial for a greater payoff down the road.</p>
<p>They do what their physical urges tell them to do, tomorrow be damned.  No amount of education or seminars or free condoms can change that because it is a way of living and looking at life.</p>
<p>People who have a culture of self-denial got it from their family and upbringing, from their acculturation, if you will.  Thus, personal habits are generally &#8216;passed on&rsquo; and cannot be learned just because we want someone to learn it.</p>
<p>If you look at &#8216;white trash&rsquo;, and I had white trash in my neighborhood as a kid, including some distant relatives, you see the same thing.  Why are those whites poor generation after generation, despite &#8216;white privilege&rsquo;?  Because the family in question does not model good values of self-denial for greater reward later.  Because white trash culture often does have at least a few positives built in, such as better manners and a concept of not tangling with the law, those whites have a chance to assimilate into middle class values, and it happens quite often.</p>
<p>But black culture is extremely self-destructive and they have no real role models (Tiger woods or the vulgar basketball stars anyone?).  White liberals have had to manufacture role models like the Huxtables and Fresh Prince of Bell Aire, to no avail.</p>
<p>Even people like Will Smith are held up as positive role models, but in his movies and in his personal life, he &#8216;fronts&rsquo; the cool character who goes through life doing whatever he wants.  Will Smith is not known to read, study, care about history or for refined behavior.</p>
<p>You get the idea.  Positive cultural values are organic, they grow through generations and can be lost quickly if a member &#8216;goes rogue.&rsquo;  If you have a huge population which has no access to traditional cultures of self-restraint, then they never learn or change their behavior.</p>
<p>When blacks lived in the south until the 1940s-1960s, they had stable environments in all black atmospheres.  School achievement was nearly on par with whites, crime was low and families were intact.  When young black men migrated north for factory jobs, they were taken out of their nurturing environment and, as young men are wont to do, they went bananas.  This is the crux of the problem.</p>

<p>Yes, we get it. White people placed those &#8220;barriers&#8221; before AAs, therefore white people are responsible for black people contracting AIDS through their sexual and drug-using practices. </p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is just one step behind the black conspiracy theory (which once would have been dismissed as &#8220;field-hand talk&#8221;) that the CIA created AIDS in a secret lab to destroy blacks. What next? Will the CDC begin citing as evidence the commentary of adherents to that theory, like Louis Farrakhan, Bill Cosby, Spike Lee, and so on and on. </p>

		<p>It shows who this article is aimed at with the very simplistic and explanitory writing style. If I had to give a grade level to it I would say about 5-6th grade since I would guess that this is the reading level of the average black person seeking this information. Most Whites, even those of more limited intellegence would understand that if you want to avoid an STD or pregnancy use a condom. This is also a way of trying to perpetrate the fallacy that AIDS was something that everyone needed to worry about, not just gays. I remember the PSAs in the late 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s about how AIDS could affect anyone. That did not pan out but the ads continued. </p>

		<p>If poverty causes AIDS, then how does that apply to Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and Howard Rollins (&#8220;Virgil Tibbs&#8221; on &#8220;In the Heat of the Night&rsquo;)? They weren&rsquo;t poverty-stricken.</p>
<p>Okay, Ashe got his via transfusion, but, even here, he was able to afford hospital care. Still, it all comes down to behavior. Look at all the Hollywood whites who died of AIDS. No poverty there.</p>
<p>This &#8220;report&#8221; is just another clarion call to throw more money at AIDS prevention.</p>

		<p>The  AIDS  thing  is  just mainly snake-oil science  made  to  keep  the  coffers of  big Pharma  full.  Proof: if  AIDS were so  easily  contracted  by  blacks  then  rosters  of  all those  black athletes, the  most  mobile and  the  most  carefree in living styles  would  have  been  severely  decimated  by  now.  That&rsquo;s  not the  case. </p>
<p>Those blacks  that  are  diagnosed  with  HIV/AIDS  are  just  people  who  are  ill  with  low  T-cell  counts.  The  2  may  or  may not  correlate.  But  it&rsquo;s  taboo  to  say  to the  AIDS  hucketsrs  that  correlation  is  not  causation.</p>

		<p>Since we have known how to avoid the spread of AIDS since the early 80s, most all who get AIDS do so due to unintelligent behavior they have freely engaged in despite knowing full well the behavior may result in AIDS. Aside from rape victims and infants born with the disease, this is a disease that people with low intellect, who are unable to modify their behavior in spite of knowing the risks, who get this disease. Stupid spreads AIDS therefore it only makes sense that the group with the lowest IQ average would have the most members with the disease. Blacks and their high AIDS rate is no coincidence at all.</p>

		<p>Blacks are not big on using condoms and they are far more promiscuous than whites are.They also have more sex with different partners  and that&rsquo;s the result. You don&rsquo;t need to spend billions in research to figure this out.</p>
