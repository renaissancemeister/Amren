			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tazeen Ahmad, Daily Mail (London), August 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sitting in the family living room, I watched tensely as my mother and her older brother signed furiously at each other. Although almost completely without sound, their row was high-octane, even vicious.</p>
<p>Three of my uncles were born deaf but they knew how to make themselves heard. Eventually, my uncle caved in and fondly put his arm around his sister.</p>
<p>My mum has always had a special place in her family because she was the first girl to live beyond childhood. Five of her sisters died as babies or toddlers. It was not until many years later that anyone worked out why so many children died and three boys were born deaf.</p>
<p>Today there is no doubt among us that this tragedy occurred because my grandparents were first cousins.</p>
<p>My grandmother&rsquo;s heart was broken from losing so many daughters at such a young age. As a parent, I can&rsquo;t imagine what she went through.</p>
<p>My family is not unique. In the UK more than 50 per cent of British Pakistanis marry their cousins  &mdash;  in Bradford that figure is 75 per cent  &mdash;  and across the country the practice is on the rise and also common among East African, Middle-Eastern and Bangladeshi communities.</p>
<p>Back when my grandparents were having children, the medical facts were not established. But today in Britain alone there are more than 70 scientific studies on the subject.</p>
<p>We know the children of first cousins are ten times more likely to be born with recessive genetic disorders which can include infant mortality, deafness and blindness.</p>
<p>We know British Pakistanis constitute 1.5 per cent of the population, yet a third of all children born in this country with rare recessive genetic diseases come from this community.</p>
<p>Despite overwhelming evidence, in the time I spent filming Dispatches: When Cousins Marry, I felt as if I was breaking a taboo rather than addressing a reality. Pakistanis have been marrying cousins for generations.</p>
<p>In South Asia the custom keeps family networks close and ensures assets remain in the family. In Britain, the aim can be to strengthen bonds with the subcontinent as cousins from abroad marry British partners.</p>
<p>Some told us they face extreme pressure to marry in this way. One young woman, &#8216;Zara&rsquo;, said when she was 16 she was emotionally blackmailed by her husband&rsquo;s family in Pakistan who threatened suicide over loss of honour should she refuse to marry her cousin.</p>
<p>She relented and lives in a deeply unhappy marriage. But others told me of the great benefits of first cousin marriage  &mdash;  love, support and understanding. To them, questioning it is an attack on the community or, worse, Islam.</p>
<p>At a Pakistani centre in Sheffield, one man said: &#8216;The community feels targeted, whether that be forced marriages or first-cousin marriages. The community is battening down its hatches, not wanting to engage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a British Pakistani, I am aware of the religious, cultural and racial sensitivities around this issue and understand why people would be on the defensive when questioned about it.</p>
<p>At times I was torn between explaining the health risks while privately understanding the community&rsquo;s sense of being demonised.</p>
<p>But I have also grown up in a family that has suffered the medical implications and strongly believe that people should have the choice to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>Throughout I had to remind myself that this is a health story  &mdash;  nothing more. It is not about religion or cultural identity. It is about avoidable suffering such at that experienced by Saeeda and Jalil Akhtar, whom I met in Bradford.</p>
<p>They are first cousins and have six children, three with the genetic disease mucolipidosis type IV. This stops the body getting rid of waste properly and affects brain functions controlling vision and movement.</p>
<p>Mohsin, their second eldest, is 17 and blind. He wanders aimless and helpless, often crying in frustration. His sisters Hina, 13, and Zainab, 11, have the same condition. They live in almost complete darkness.</p>
<p>Saeeda is worn down from years of round-the-clock care. She spoon-feeds them, dresses them and fears for them. Neither she nor her husband can quite accept that their familial link is the cause of this pain.</p>
<p>This is a major public health issue that has huge implications for other services. The cost to the NHS is many millions of pounds.</p>
<p>On average, a children&rsquo;s hospital will see 20 to 30 recessive gene disorders a decade, but one hospital in Bradford has seen 165, while British Pakistani children are three times more likely to have learning difficulties, with care costing about Â£75,000 a year per child.</p>
<p>However during this investigation we found no efforts to introduce any national awareness-raising campaign. Why?</p>
<p>We approached 16 MPs with a significant number of British Pakistani constituents for interview  &mdash;  every one declined. We asked 30 MPs with a high population of British Pakistanis in their seats to give their views in a short survey. Only one, who wanted to remain  anonymous, responded, saying anyone who tried to talk about it risked being attacked politically.</p>
<p>A lone voice was Ann Cryer, former Labour MP for Keighley, near Bradford, who said &#8216;fear of being accused of racism or demonisation&rsquo; prevented politicians speaking up.</p>
<p>It is not just British Pakistani families who suffer. Wayne and Sonia Gibbs are white and first cousins once removed. They had no idea this could lead to problems. Their daughter Nicole had juvenile osteopetrosis, a genetic disease that causes the bones to thicken and crush the body&rsquo;s organs. Nicole died aged two.</p>
<p>The couple now know both carry the recessive genes that caused Nicole&rsquo;s illness. They wanted more children  &mdash;  but had genetic counselling first. They have two healthy boys today.</p>
<p>I have travelled nationwide, meeting doctors and families whose lives are full of pain. To me the solution is simple: Ring the alarm bells loud and clear.</p>
<p>In Birmingham, one GP practice has taken radical action. The doctors have campaigned heavily to stop cousin marriages. They have introduced genetic screening and testing for patients, starting at 16, and now claim that very few cousin marriages take place there.</p>
<p>My mother tells me that, long before I was born, her siblings and their cousins decided their tragedy would never recur.</p>
<p>The conclusion some will draw is that cousin marriages should be banned. I disagree. But people must be able to make informed choices about the risks involved and options available, be they genetic screening, counselling or carrier-testing.</p>
<p>At least there should be leaflets in doctors&rsquo; surgeries and school campaigns.</p>
<p>Meeting the families in the programme upset me greatly. Every day for them was an uphill struggle, mostly because their children needed so much help and this put enormous stress on their family lives.</p>
<p>Yet this was avoidable. If this were any other health issue, politicians would have been out in force. But they are silent and as a result children continue to be born with terrible, prevent_able disabilities that are devastating their lives and those of their loved ones.</p>
<p>In response to this story a Department of Health spokesman said: &#8216;The risk of having a child affected by a genetic disorder following cousin marriage is a complex and sensitive issue that is best discussed and assessed with specialised genetics services.</p>
<p>&#8216;Through genetic services the NHS runs local initiatives aimed to raise awareness of the risks associated with cousin marriage.&rsquo;</p>

 In the history of sailors finding small islands throughout the Pacific; they were amazed that the island elders encouraged their young women to have sex with them.<br>
 Later, it was learned that the elders recognized the medical problems with inbreeding and that the group would die if &#8220;fresh blood&#8221; was not introduced.</p>

		<p>Muslims should be allowed to marry cousins, what should not be allowed is Muslims being married in the UK.  Let them keep their customs and their nations and we will keep our customs and our nations.  Very simple solution.</p>

<p><i>That</i> is the problem.  Not cousin marriage <i>per se</i>, but rather the fact that it&rsquo;s been going on as a matter of unbroken family custom for centuries, with cumulative effect.</p>
<p>But of course, no White may mention these things without being silenced as a Racist.  Criticism of congenital inbreeding might have an &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on Once-great Britain&rsquo;s precious &#8220;Asians,&#8221; after all.</p>

<p>No, Tazeen.  You are either British <i>or</i> Pakistani.  Here&rsquo;s a hint: your genes did not come from the native population of the British Isles.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but any civilized group of people with an ounce of common sense would never marry a blood relative of such close relation. Even in medieval times, the Catholic Church in Europe forbade consanguineous marriage. Only royalty engaged in it, and even then typically not at so close a level of relation. These people are disgusting. And isn&rsquo;t it the law in the UK that such marriages are forbidden? It&rsquo;s the case here in the U.S. Come on, why do you think we all make fun of West Virginia? Same with Tasmania in Australia. The difference is, referring to these places as incestuous is a joke; telling the truth about SE Asians is forbidden, because it&rsquo;s true.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I get this Gallilean feeling&hellip;</p>
<p>Except that this isn&rsquo;t about the twirling of spheres.  This is about people with -generations- of inbreeding coming to a new country and starting it up all over again.  Even if they were attractive to the local population, they bear huge genetic risks which will ALWAYS be present, looking for a chance to express themselves.  So that if you &#8216;spread the odds&rsquo; by having a local Eurobrit marry a Pakibrit and -their- children marry out, you are now spreading the defective genes through whatever cosmopolitan pop group they &#8216;diversify&rsquo; with.</p>
<p>Genetic screening can help but once the genes are disseminated there is nothing to keep them coming back together, even if at reduced recurrency.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, if you cannot assimilate a population, what happens?  That&rsquo;s right, they island themselves and forever take away a slice of the communal economic pie.  And like Hawaii, these island pop groups tend to have huge internal explosions of birth rate as stress-dominance instinct (not that Pakistani families are all that small anyway) and you end up in a demographic war supporting crippled and normal children that altogether outnumber yours as much as 4:1.</p>
<p>If nothing else, these fools should be told they will get _not one shilling_ of NHS coverage until they join the 21st century.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about race, it&rsquo;s about public, genetic, hygiene.</p>

		<p>I watched this documentry last night and it was jaw dropping at times, particularly when they gave members of the Pakistani community a chance to give their opinions, most of the young ones were repulsed by the whole concept of marrying there cousins and the most of the old ones were all for it, some even blamed Western medicines for their childs conditions. </p>

		<p>Wow, Â£75,000 a year ($116,000) to care for one of these children. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be simpler to allot this as a one time sum to ship them back to Pakistan, build a house, and set up a bank account than to soak the British taxpayers year after year? Let the Pakistani government deal with these problems. Maybe if they were bankrupt enough, they could get some Iman to issue an edict forbidding cousin marriage. Then again as long as they remained there, it might be beneficial to the west. </p>
<p>Marriage between close relatives was forbidden in the times of the Old Testament and I&rsquo;m sure they didn&rsquo;t have the gee whiz-bang medical technology that is available now. FWIW, I went and looked up marriage laws in West Virginia. Marriage between cousins is illegal in that state. </p>
<p>If this occurred in Pakistan, I wonder how &#8220;Western Medicine&#8221; is to blame? </p>

		<p>This is a very misleading article. Ahmad talks of &#8220;evidence&#8221; but the evidence for what she says, on closer examination, is full of holes. The reality is that a single first-cousin marriage increases the risk of birth defects from about 3% to 5-6%, not ten times over. Her figures are simply wrong.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein married their cousins. This issue is not what many are making out. </p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;ve known some Palestinians who have married their cousins, but I couldn&rsquo;t determine if they were first or second cousins. Many Palestinian arranged marriages are with tribal relatives. However, they have huge extended families so they may or may not be closely related. Marriage outside the tribe or kinship structure is frowned upon even here in liberated America. </p>

		<p>Perhaps these Pakistanis should jump on the anti-vaccine bandwagon.  It works here in the US, after all, even though thimerosal hasn&rsquo;t been used as a vaccine preservative since mid-2001.</p>
<p>The poster who mentioned sexual hospitality on the south Pacific islands was correct.  Small, isolated populations of any animals experience the greatest degree of genetic problems and the fastest genetic drift.  Unfortunately, the Polynesians traded one problem - inbreeding - for another, as the early sailors they encountered spread venereal diseases.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not dwell on the negative results of inbreeding. Every breed of dogs, cats, goats and cattle is the result of selective inbreeding.<br>
Is it possible that the Pakis can breed out their genetic faults through a more intense inbreeding program? I don&rsquo;t know, but I say go ahead and give it a try. At the very least, the resulting higher infant mortality rate will result in less Pakis, which will positively affect the number of genetically flawed Pakis.<br>
It&rsquo;s a winning situation for Old Blighty any way you count it.</p>

<p>Well said. One must also keep in mind the original population size, hereditary diseases already running in the family, etc. </p>
<p>Folks who live in a place for more than two generations tend to end up related to a whole heck of a lot of people in the area and cousin marriages of a more distant variety can become the norm.</p>

		<p>An Indian engineer with whom I worked married his cousin (don&rsquo;t know if it was his first cousin, however) and their first child died of some congenital defect after a year, so I wonder if this issue afflicts Indians also.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I am wrong, but in most states, marriage between second cousins is not prohibited, to my knowledge. I don&rsquo;t know about first cousins with additional separation, e.g. first cousins twice removed. </p>

		<p>Ole White Jim, </p>
<p>Consanguineous unions don&rsquo;t mean that &#8220;the resulting higher infant mortality rate will result in less Pakis.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Consanguineous couples have lower rates of miscarriage then &#8220;regular&#8221; couples due to immunological compatibility. </p>
<p>So what you probably have is a higher birth rate, subsequently followed by a higher infant mortality.</p>

		<p>To call incestuous relations &#8220;cultural&#8221; and say the British Pakistanis should be informed of the genetic consequences but they should still be allowed to marry their first cousins is hypocritical, almost laughable. They KNOW the consequences - they live with their damaged children and grandchildren everyday! The facts this woman is hiding is that women in Pakistani culture are not given a choice in anything, but told what they will do, or suffer the consequences: <br>
beatings,intimidation, verbal& mental assault along with being ousted from the family with no means to support themselves. The underside of this is children of these third world people experience considerably more molestation at the hands of their relatives than Americans are subject to. There are laws in this country that prohibit that. Where they come from, women and children are considered property only. </p>

		<p>P.S. ~~ and the charity Doctors Without Borders, always pleading for donations, going over to fix the extraordinarily large number of cleft palates and other birth defects in these third world (brown) children? Something they do not want advertised? A large majority of those birth defects are from inbreeding. They don&rsquo;t want it advertised so they&rsquo;ll continue to receive donations.  </p>
