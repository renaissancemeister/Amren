<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Italy&rsquo;s main anti-immigrant party, a pillar of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s coalition, praised France&rsquo;s expulsion of scores of Roma on Thursday as a model to follow.</p>
<p>Claudio d&rsquo;Amico, a lawmaker with the Northern League, said he believed &#8220;the line adopted by France on repatriating the Roma is the right line to follow&#8221; as Italy mulls ways to deal with its own soaring immigration.</p>
<p>He said Rome would have to act &#8220;as quickly as possible&#8221; to block Roma expelled by France to Romania from heading to Italy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to give a strong signal to avoid that happening. It must be made clear to all, Roma and non-Roma, that in our country those who live on the edge and in volation of the law are not tolerated and mustn&rsquo;t put a foot on Italian soil,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>France on Thursday began expelling scores of Roma, packing them on planes and flying them back to Romania at the start of a crackdown ordered by President Nicolas Sarkozy which has drawn strong criticism at home.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s 160,000 Roma community has long been at the centre of debate over immigration policy and security, stoked repeatedly by the Northern League, an essential ally in Berlusconi&rsquo;s return to power in 2008.</p>
<p>The coalition campaigned on pledges of cracking down on illegal immigration and crime, often linking the two.</p>
<p>Human rights groups like Amnesty International have criticised an increase in discrimination in Italy against groups like the Roma and African farm workers, who have come under violent attack in the south of the country.</p>
<p>Long a magnet for economic migrants from Africa, Italy earlier this year introduced a new policy to turn back immigrants before they arrive on Italian shores aboard boats from north Africa.<br>

		<p>If Gypsies don&rsquo;t like their name they will have to find something other than Roma. Sorry but the name has already been taken in Europe by Romans and Romanians. I&rsquo;m sure many people are confused by this. </p>

		<p>Since Israel is the most tolerant of nations, why don&rsquo;t the Roma just immigrate there?</p>

		<p>If the French and the Italians have the stones to deport Gypsies who have illegally entered their countries that leaves me wondering when they&rsquo;re going to be willing to deport the North Africans who are causing at least as much trouble.</p>
<p>As for the U.S., there seems to be no hope that we will ever have politicians willing to deport illegal immigrants.  The Democrats actively encourage illegal immigration and the Republicans do absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>As someone said in a previous article, merely shuffling these people around Europe from country to country does not solve the overall problem. I the long run it accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>They should be sent back to whence they came:  India.</p>

		<p>&#8220;in our country those who live on the edge and in volation of the law are not tolerated&#8221; This is a bit rich, but no matter.</p>
<p>A few months ago I was in an Italian supermarket and I made some small talk with the cashier.  The supermarket is in a rough neighborhood rife with gypsies.  She told me openly what she thought of them, calmly but strongly enough that I can&rsquo;t repeat what she said.  It&rsquo;s nice that people here don&rsquo;t yet feel the need to go through the mental and linguistic contortions that they do in other countries when speaking about race.</p>

		<p>This really isn&rsquo;t that much to celebrate.  Gyspsies are Indians, they don&rsquo;t belong in any European country.  </p>
