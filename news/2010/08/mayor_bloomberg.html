	<p>Press Release, New York City Government, August 24, 2010</p>
<p>News from the Blue Room</p>
<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>PR- 367-10<br>
August 24, 2010</p>
<p>Mayor Bloomberg Hosts Annual Ramadan Iftar Dinner at Gracie Mansion</p>
<p>The following are Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg&rsquo;s remarks as delivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good evening, and Ramadan Kareem, and I want to welcome everyone to our annual Ramadan Iftar at Gracie Mansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We call this &#8216;The People&rsquo;s House,&rsquo; because it belongs to all 8.4 million New Yorkers who call this city home. And people of every race and religion, every background and belief. And we celebrate that diversity here in this house with gatherings like this one.</p>
<p>&#8220;And for me, whether it&rsquo;s marking St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day or Harlem Week or any other occasion, these gatherings are always a powerful reminder of what makes our city so strong and our country so great.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, America is a nation of immigrants, and I think it&rsquo;s fair to say no place opens its doors more widely to the world than New York City. America is the land of opportunity, and I think it&rsquo;s fair to say no place offers its residents more opportunity to pursue their dreams than New York City. And America is a beacon of freedom, and I think it&rsquo;s fair to say no place defends those freedoms more fervently, or has been attacked for those freedoms more ferociously, than New York City.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recent weeks, a debate has arisen that I believe cuts to the core of who we are as a city and a country. The proposal to build a mosque and community center in Lower Manhattan has created a national conversation on religion in America, and since Ramadan offers a time for reflection, I wanted to take a few minutes to reflect on that very subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are people of good will on both sides of the debate, and I would hope that everyone can carry on a dialogue in a civil and respectful way. In fact, I think most people now agree on two fundamental issues: First, that Muslims have a constitutional right to build a mosque in Lower Manhattan and second, that the site of the World Trade Center is hallowed ground. And the only question we face is: how do we honor that hallowed ground?</p>
<p>&#8220;The wounds of 9/11 are still very much with us. And I know that is true for Talat Hamdani, who is here with us tonight, and who lost her son, Salman Hamdani, on 9/11. There will always be a hole in our hearts for the men and women who perished that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the attacks, some argued  &mdash;  including some of those who lost loved ones  &mdash;  that the entire site should be reserved for a memorial. But we decided  &mdash;  together, as a city  &mdash;  that the best way to honor all those we lost, and to repudiate our enemies, was to build a moving memorial and to rebuild the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted the site to be an inspiring reminder to the world that this city will never forget our dead and never stop living. We vowed to bring Lower Manhattan back  &mdash;  stronger than ever  &mdash;  as a symbol of our defiance and I think it&rsquo;s fair to say we have. Today, it is more of a community neighborhood than ever before, with more people than ever living, working, playing and praying there.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we say that a mosque or a community center should not be built near the perimeter of the World Trade Center site, we would compromise our commitment to fighting terror with freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would undercut the values and principles that so many heroes died protecting. We would feed the false impressions that some Americans have about Muslims. We would send a signal around the world that Muslim Americans may be equal in the eyes of the law, but separate in the eyes of their countrymen. And we would hand a valuable propaganda tool to terrorist recruiters, who spread the fallacy that America is at war with Islam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Islam did not attack the World Trade Center  &mdash;  Al-Qaeda did. To implicate all of Islam for the actions of a few who twisted a great religion is unfair and un-American. Today we are not at war with Islam  &mdash;  we are at war with Al-Qaeda and other extremists who hate freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this very moment, there are young Americans  &mdash;  some of them Muslims  &mdash;  standing freedoms&rsquo; watch in Iraq and Afghanistan, and around the world. A couple here tonight, Sakibeh and Asaad Mustafa, have children who have served our country overseas and after 9/11, one of them aided in the recovery efforts at Ground Zero. And I&rsquo;d like to ask them to stand, so we can show our appreciation. There you go. Thank you.</p>
<p>&#8220;The members of our military are men and women at arms  &mdash;  battling for hearts and minds. And their greatest weapon in that fight is the strength of our American values, which have already inspired people around the world. If we do not practice here at home what we preach abroad  &mdash;  if we do not lead by example  &mdash;  we undermine our soldiers. We undermine our foreign policy objectives. And we undermine our national security.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a different era, with different international challenges facing the country, President Kennedy&rsquo;s Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, explained to Congress why it is so important for us to live up to our ideals here at home. Dean Rusk said, &#8216;The United States is widely regarded as the home of democracy and the leader of the struggle for freedom, for human rights, for human dignity. We are expected to be the model.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are expected to be the model. Nearly a half-century later, his words remain true. In battling our enemies, we cannot rely entirely on the courage of our soldiers or the competence of our diplomats. We all have to do our part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as we fought communism by showing the world the power of free markets and free elections, so must we fight terrorism by showing the world the power of religious freedom and cultural tolerance. Freedom and tolerance will always defeat tyranny and terrorism  &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s the great lesson of the 20th century, and we must not abandon it here in the 21st.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I understand the impulse to find another location for the mosque and community center. I understand the pain of those who are motivated by loss too terrible to contemplate. And there are people of every faith  &mdash;  including, perhaps, some in this room  &mdash;  who are hoping that a compromise will end the debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it won&rsquo;t. The question will then become, how big should the &#8216;no-mosque zone&rsquo; be around the World Trade Center site? There is already a mosque four blocks away. Should it be moved?</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a test of our commitment to American values. We have to have the courage of our convictions. We must do what is right, not what is easy. And we must put our faith in the freedoms that have sustained our great country for more than 200 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I know that many in this room are disturbed and dispirited by the debate. But it&rsquo;s worth keeping some perspective on the matter. The first colonial settlers came to these shores seeking religious liberty and the founding fathers wrote a constitution that guaranteed it. They made sure that in this country government would not be permitted to choose between religions or favor one over another. </p>
<p>&#8220;Nonetheless, it was not so long ago that Jews and Catholics had to overcome stereotypes and build bridges to those who viewed them with suspicion and less than fully American. In 1960, many Americans feared that John F. Kennedy would impose papal law on America. But through his example, he taught us that piety to a minority religion is no obstacle to patriotism. It is a lesson I think that needs updating today, and it is our responsibility to accept the challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before closing, let me just add one final thought: Imam Rauf, who is now overseas promoting America and American values, has been put under a media microscope. Each of us may strongly agree or strongly disagree with particular statements that he has made. And that&rsquo;s how it should be  &mdash;  this is New York City.</p>
<p>&#8220;And while a few of his statements have received a lot of attention, I would like to read you something that he said that you may not have heard. At an interfaith memorial service for the martyred journalist Daniel Pearl, Imam Rauf said, quote, &#8216;If to be a Jew means to say with all one&rsquo;s heart, mind, and soul: Shma&rsquo; Yisrael, Adonai Elohenu Adonai Ehad; Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One, not only today I am a Jew, I have always been one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then continued to say, &#8216;If to be a Christian is to love the Lord our God with all of my heart, mind and soul, and to love for my fellow human being what I love for myself, then not only am I a Christian, but I have always been one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that spirit, let me declare that we in New York are Jews and Christians and Muslims, and we always have been. And above all of that, we are Americans, each with an equal right to worship and pray where we choose. There is nowhere in the five boroughs of New York City that is off limits to any religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;By affirming that basic idea, we will honor America&rsquo;s values and we will keep New York the most open, diverse, tolerant, and free city in the world. Thank you and enjoy.&#8221;<br>

		<p>We must demand that Bloomberg put himself and his family under Sharia law:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.academia.org/shariah-on-the-move/" rel="nofollow">https://www.academia.org/shariah-on-the-move/</a></p>
<p><br>
Here are her top 20 aspects of Shariah:</p>
<p>1- Jihad, defined as &ldquo;to war against non-Muslims to establish the religion,&rdquo; is the duty of every Muslim and Muslim head of state (Caliph). Muslim Caliphs who refuse jihad are in violation of Sharia and unfit to rule.</p>
<p>2- A Caliph can hold office through seizure of power meaning through force.</p>
<p>3- A Caliph is exempt from being charged with serious crimes such as murder, adultery, robbery, theft, drinking and in some cases of rape.</p>
<p>4- A percentage of Zakat (charity money) must go towards jihad.</p>
<p>5- It is obligatory to obey the commands of the Caliph, even if he is unjust.</p>
<p>6- A caliph must be a Muslim, a non-slave and a male.</p>
<p>7- The Muslim public must remove the Caliph if he rejects Islam.</p>
<p>8- A Muslim who leaves Islam must be killed immediately.</p>
<p>9- A Muslim will be forgiven for murder of: 1) an apostate 2) an adulterer 3) a highway robber. Vigilante street justice and honor killing is acceptable.</p>
<p>10- A Muslim will not get the death penalty if he kills a non-Muslim, but will get it for killing a Muslim.</p>
<p>11- Sharia never abolished slavery, sexual slavery and highly regulates it. A master will not be punished for killing his slave.</p>
<p>12- Sharia dictates death by stoning, beheading, amputation of limbs, flogging even for crimes of sin such as adultery.</p>
<p>13- Non-Muslims are not equal to Muslims under the law. They must comply to Islamic law if they are to remain safe. They are forbidden to marry Muslim women, publicly display wine or pork, recite their scriptures or openly celebrate their religious holidays or funerals. They are forbidden from building new churches or building them higher than mosques. They may not enter a mosque without permission. A non-Muslim is no longer protected if he leads a Muslim away from Islam.</p>
<p>14- It is a crime for a non-Muslim to sell weapons to someone who will use them against Muslims. Non-Muslims cannot curse a Muslim, say anything derogatory about Allah, the Prophet, or Islam, or expose the weak points of Muslims. But Muslims can curse non-Muslims.</p>
<p>15- A non-Muslim cannot inherit from a Muslim.</p>
<p>16- Banks must be Sharia compliant and interest is not allowed.</p>
<p>17- No testimony in court is acceptable from people of low-level jobs, such as street sweepers or bathhouse attendants. Women in low level jobs such as professional funeral mourners cannot keep custody of their children in case of divorce.</p>
<p>18- A non-Muslim cannot rule  &mdash;  even over a non-Muslim minority.</p>
<p>19- Homosexuality is punishable by death.</p>
<p>20- There is no age limit for marriage of girls. The marriage contract can take place anytime after birth and can be consummated at age 8 or 9.<br>

		<p>Remember that Bloomberg, along with the other oligarchs Gates and Buffet, are in favor of mass amnesty for the millions of illegals in the U.S.  The man is a disgusting, self-serving traitor, who has completely lost touch (if he ever indeed was in touch) with most Americans.</p>

<p>Because, really, how utterly patronizing for this  transnational cosmopolitan to celebrate a tradition to which he does not belong, and despite what he and the Current Occupant say, has never been a part of the American tradition.</p>

		<p>Celebrations of racial and ethnic diversity are what make America great?</p>
<p>To the extent that America&rsquo;s still great, it&rsquo;s in spite of racial and ethnic diversities.</p>
<p>No nation in world history has survived large scale racial and ethnic diversities, the most recent example being the disintegration of the USSR and perhaps the first well-documented example dating back to the collapse of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>A certain level of such diversity is tolerable and even in some ways perhaps beneficial.  Too much is pure social and political poison.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m quite tired of all of this cuddling up to this snake called Islam.  Bloomberg has vast financial interests in the middle east, and that&rsquo;s most likely why he&rsquo;s cozying up to these stealth jihadists  &mdash;  otherwise, he&rsquo;s either a fool or evil.  Islam needs to be mocked, not coddled.  The devil cannot stand to be mocked, and neither can Muhammad:</p>

		<p>GOD! I couldn&rsquo;t even read this entire article&hellip;the things I&rsquo;ve seen muslims do to each other and to US over here in Afghanistan and Iraq don&rsquo;t make me as sick as Bloomberg does..People like him is why the U.S. is gonna end up fighting in the streets with muslims just as they/we are doing over here in the muslim wars now. America proper is going to learn all about IEDs,EFPs, suicide bombers and all those fun things that we over here in the muslim wars live with every day.</p>

		<p>I agree with Derrick #3.  I&rsquo;ve suspected all along that there must be some financial incentive for Bloomberg to push for the mosque-building with such ferocity.  It&rsquo;s as though he doesn&rsquo;t even hear the majority opposition in his own city.  Apparently, he never intends to run for mayor again.</p>

<p><br>
Billionaire Bloomberg does have vast financial interests.  But he is neither a fool nor evil (not that I&rsquo;m defending him, mind you.) He&rsquo;s just doing &#8220;what is good for&#8221; him and his group, not for your or your group.  </p>
<p>As &#8220;Mugged&#8221; said above, Bloomberg is a  <i>&#8220;transnational cosmopolitan&#8221;,</i>to whom money talks,  and that describes him perfectly. He marches to a different drummer. What becomes of you and the USA is not his worry. He couldn&rsquo;t care less.  But whatever happens, in any case, he&rsquo;ll be making money off it.</p>

No, this is not about money (for once). This &#8220;we are all a nation of immigrants&#8221; line is a continuation of the same  idea behind the inscription they put on the Staue of Liberty: &#8220;Give me your wretched masses&hellip;blah, blah&#8221; </p>
<p>Internationalists like Bloomberg WANT to see the dilution of the American population to the point where the white founding stock is no longer the majority, no longer in control, no longer significant.  He  will do ANYTHING to hasten that in order to bring it about. This, for once, is not about money. </p>
<p>It <i>is  </i>about control, though.  They want to disestablish the rule of white Americans and replace it with themselves,  a new  money-based ruling class, backed up by a confused swarm of indistinguishable colored masses. Such people as Bloomberg may not really give a hoot about Muslims   &mdash;   or blacks, or Hindus, or Somalis, or whatever   &mdash;   but those groups all serve as battering rams to weaken the hold of whites on the country we built, which is exactly what the likes of Bloomberg want.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand that, you don&rsquo;t see the whole picture.</p>

<p>This is completely true, however  &mdash;  it is also about money.  &#8220;They want to disestablish the rule of white Americans and replace it with themselves, a new money-based ruling class.&#8221;  This new class needs money if it is to be money-based, does it not?  I&rsquo;m not trying to be a jerk  &mdash;  I completely agree with you.  But Bloomberg also has vast financial interests in this  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s not afraid to kowtow to the Muslims to get the money to finance his accumulation of power.  I&rsquo;m not trying to be insulting in any way  &mdash;  I think you have an intelligent point that most people will miss.  It is about money, though, as well.</p>

<p>If you wish to see into the muslim mindset, the videos listed above may help.  Keep in mind that these are parodies, but evil needs to be mocked.</p>

<p>I agree that Bloomberg is that kind of Machiavellian cretin, but in the case of the G0M, I still think it&rsquo;s money.  Here&rsquo;s more corroboration of that, IMHO:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/37fv7j4" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/37fv7j4</a></p>
<p>This McPaper writer thinks that Obama should try to buy off Bloomberg to make the G0M controversy go away (i.e. before it costs the Democrats another 20 House seats).  Now, if this were a philosophical thing on Bloomberg&rsquo;s part, as you suggest, then there&rsquo;s no amount of consideration Obama could offer that would make him change his mind.  But, this writer thinks that Bloomberg is buy-off-able, meaning that his motivation for G0M is money in the first place.</p>
