<h1>Foreign-Born Workers Get Three-Quarters of British Jobs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times of India (New Delhi), August 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Workers born outside Britain bagged most of the jobs in the country despite a steep surge in recruitment this year, adding to the worries of unemployed British youths, campaigners have said.</p>
<p>Employment levels in three months between April and June rose from 184,000 to 29 million in the biggest quarterly hike since 1989. But about three-quarters of this increase was due to workers born outside Britain, the data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals.</p>
<p>The new figures were &#8220;further evidence that immigration really does affect the job prospects of British-born workers&#8221;, Sir Andrew Green, from Migrationwatch UK, was quoted as saying by Daily Mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;An astonishingly high proportion of the increase in employment is down to foreign workers getting jobs in Britain,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The quarterly rise in workers born outside was 145,000, compared with an increase of just 41,000 Britain-born workers. The overall figure is adjusted to take account of how the labour market is affected by seasonal factors, such as school leavers starting work in June, the ONS said.</p>
<p>The figures also showed a total of 25.08 million people born in Britain were in jobs in the three months in 2010, down 15,000 on a year earlier. However, the number of people born outside Britain who were in jobs was up 114,000 to 3.85 million, compared with the same time last year.</p>
<p>Employment rate for Britain-born people aged from 16 to 64 was 70.9 percent in the three months to June 2010, down 0.5 percent on a year earlier. The corresponding rate for foreign-born people was 66.5 percent, up 0.5 percent on this time last year.</p>
<p>Immigration minister Damian Green said: &#8220;I recognise the importance of attracting the brightest and the best to ensure strong economic growth, but unlimited migration can place unacceptable pressure on public services.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our aim to reduce the level of net migration back down to the levels of the 1990s  &mdash;  tens of thousands each year, not hundreds of thousands. Introducing a limit on migrants from outside Europe coming here to work is just one of the ways we intend to achieve this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alongside our limits there will be action to get people back to work and provide business with the skills they need from the British workforce  &mdash;  reducing the need for migrants at the same time as we reduce their number.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of young people trapped in long-term unemployment has also soared by 41.9 percent in the last year.</p>
<p>The figures reveal that 72,000 people aged 18 to 24 had been out of work for two years or more in the three months up to June. This was an 11 percent increase on the previous quarter  &mdash;  and a 41.9 percent increase in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The figures fuel fears that tens of thousands of young people have never had a job and risk being caught in an inescapable unemployment trap.</p>
<p>Employment rose as the number of part-time workers lifted by 115,000 in the quarter to a record 7.84 million  &mdash;  suggesting more people are struggling to find full-time permanent jobs. But the ONS said there was also a lift in those in full-time work, up by 68,000 to 21.2 million in the first quarter of the current financial year.</p>
<p>The figures also showed the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent between April and June.<br>

		<p>10,000,000-plus Americans are out of work here in the states. 10,000,000-plus illegal immigrants live in America.</p>
<p>I spend my money at White establishments. I am very conscious now about directing my money toward White Americans. I have made a vow never to buy another tortilla or another jar of salsa.</p>
<p>Hire your fellow White Americans. Give to your fellow White Americans. Lift up your fellow White Americans.</p>

		<p>Wow!  30% unemployment.  The British government has abandoned the British people.  Pure greed.  British businessmen want cheap non-white labor and British politicians want more votes.  British businessmen and politicians are working to replace the British people with non-whites.</p>

		<p>Whatever are the rights and wrongs of the issue (ie if the foreigners are better qualified and more efficient workers than native Britons), it is an absolutely terrible, shameful and devastating indictment of the failure of British government in not only betraying and casting aside its own people to wither and die, but an appalling failure of the untold billions the British government spends on education, social security and job training.</p>
<p> In fact it is little short of high treason committed by the British government against its own people.</p>
<p> The supreme irony is that this all occurred under a Labour Party administration  .Believe it or not, the &#8216;Labour Party&rsquo; (hence its name), was established purely to fight for class interest of the British working class - it had no other remit.</p>
<p> The contempt the modern Labour Party has for workers is by far WORSE than anything the Tories could be accused of.</p>

		<p>In my small market in Suffolk most of the local industrial firms hire Poles and East Europeans, local staff on temp contracts have been laid off.</p>
<p>I can now walk around the town and hear only Polish and Russian being spoken, all very sad.</p>

		<p>I would prefer Britain to be totally composed of Celts and AngloSaxons. But if British youth don&rsquo;t work hard, learn skills, and take school seriously, the avaricious Indians, Paks and Africans will vacuum up what&rsquo;s available. </p>
<p>The British govt lacks the guts as does British business to embargo foreigners from the Third World and downsize and cut the standard of living if necessary until white Britons understand they have to step up. </p>
<p>Britain can encourage Irish, white South African,white European, and even white American immigration, but will catch hell from the US and the UN if it does so at the expense of Asians and Africans who care nothing for British traditions and manners.</p>
<p> White Britons dug their own grave because they wanted American living standards without the sacrifice necessary to study and invest.</p>

		<p>Commentator #1: I share your frustration. </p>
<p>But, but boycott SALSA? If you think most salsa sold in the US is made by Mexicans or Mexican companies, you probably think most vehicles in the USA are made by American-owned .companies. Multinationals like Unilever, ConAgra and Nestle make or process practically everything we eat except for a few  boutique, small companies (Paul Newman), local outfits(very small) or for what you might  buy at a farmers market.  </p>
<p>Even much of the organic food, socalled, is grown or processed by major corporations based in the US or Europe.  They don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s salsa or &#8220;Italian&#8221; salad dressing. Profit rules, not ethnicity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why multinationals don&rsquo;t use their power to force governments to stop illegal immmigration or immigration in general. People are commodities.Like the tomatoes in Salsa.</p>
<p>If only our problems were salsa!</p>

		<p>A LOT of these illegals come here to take construction jobs.  They flooded in after Katrina and were awarded contracts that Americans should have had.  They don&rsquo;t come here to pick lettuce.  They come here for highway jobs, construction jobs of all sorts, service industry jobs (you know, the ones our American college kids took to afford college) etc etc.  I vowed that any time we need work on the house or yard, if a crew showed up with hispanics, I would ask the foreman to see the green cards of his employees.  Even if he actually presented me with such, I would kick him AND his crew off my property, telling him I will ONLY pay Americans for work.  NOT aliens stealing jobs from Americans.  And further, I will never do business with his firm ever, and put them on my black list.  We can begin there - all of us refusing to patronize ANY place wherein illegals are hired.  The local Denny&rsquo;s has been taken over by hispanics.  The entire staff from greeter, manager, table clear, cooks, wait staff, and dish washers are ALL hispanic.  Same in many restaurants these days.  Boycott them all, and them them WHY.</p>

Elitism is digging the grave of all of us.  Elitism that was born -in collaboration with- the notion that all people who have &#8216;the same civil rights&rsquo; are inherently equal.  Which is not true, even among whites.  You take someone to whom a walk in the gardens on Olympus is -anything- Western and you have an inherent disparity between what is good enough and what is seen as truly -good-, as a standard of living.  That this humility can lead to economic downfall on it&rsquo;s own should be obvious in the 2nd generation (born here, still ethnic X, still divorced from the indigene populace&rsquo;s idea of interbreedable worth) attitudes that mirror the home grown ones.  And in the incredible birth rates that strangle all attempts as innovation as the effort just to sustain overwhelms investment in not only education but also technologies.<br>
The problem is that, until we apply some real genomic therapies to the problem of IQ, there will always be at least a 1/3rd of society who are born ditch diggers in relation to their own pop group.  Now, you can replace them with robots and give the robot wages to them &#8216;just to live and be good&rsquo;.  Thereby maintaining a genetic placemarker with the rest of their own ethnic group&rsquo;s gene pool.<br>
Or you can replace them with fleshbots as a wage slave by any other name.  Putting your elitist group loyalty (I want to live like you and I -do- look like you, so cough up and maybe my pretty daughter will marry your rich son) at risk to not-my-skin-color overrun.  With the consequences that has for real IQ, social conformity and other _genetic driven_ variables.<br>
But one way or the other, you are going to have to realize that, as industrialization makes the value of human labor worth less and less vs. the cost of supporting it&rsquo;s existence with health care and education and retirement investment.  More and more people who don&rsquo;t nominally NOT deserve to have a good life.  Are instead going to be headed right back the the Feudal levels of existance.  Because they lack the drive or the brains or the social positioning to be a success story.<br>
As an example: Ben Franklin was a genius in his time.  But only insofar as he was a self taught generalist who used his connections to work his way up a ladder in a new society for which the times provided that opportunity.  Today, he would be only slightly above normal in IQ, all his ideas re: printing and electricity would be common knowledge or socially outmoded beyond his ability to comprehend, let alone further innovate without college engineering study.  And all forms of social connections to higher government would be doomed by his cross-gender efforts as a social commentator, as certainly as Boy George.<br>
@6<br>
White Identity and conformity isn&rsquo;t about the label, it&rsquo;s about the culture.  That is the one area that attempts to turn us all into a universal mob of genericists (what&rsquo;s football without beer, chips and dip?) has not completely corrupted our inner souls.  As long as hispanic culture was (Tex-Mex) Taco Bell, it was exotic.  Now that hispanic culture is the neighbor with 10 people living in his house and a yard full of toys and bad grass, we are starting to learn that ecclecticism is not all that it&rsquo;s &#8216;no harm, no foul&rsquo; cracked up to be.<br>
Eat a steak.  Nuke an ear of corn.  Have a slice of pie to go with that salad.  It will be healthier for you than the slop that passes for Hispanic food.  And by identifying with the origin of YOUR culture as a means to shut out the commercial intrusion of multinational corporatism upon -your- world, you disable it&rsquo;s universal wealth base by ethnic solidarity.<br>
Which is all good.</p>

<p> Yes, the British Labour Party cares about the working man  &mdash;  the Third World working man! Anyone who thinks the British elites care about anyone but themselves and their underclass allies is a political fool. Only one party represents indigenous working class British people  &mdash;  the BNP. The others are all part of the privileged international elite, who, deep down, distrust and dislike average white people.</p>

<p>I disagree with this. It has nothing to do with what White Britons want or any lack of study and investment. The British elite and business and politicians, just like here in the USA, want  ethnic votes, cheap labor and only care about filling their pockets and if it&rsquo;s at the expense of the country, so be it. Just like in the USA, things in the UK were done quite well by the natives for centuries before the massive immigration invasion.</p>

		<p>Adams, #5,  Perhaps your idea might be better argued if it read, &#8216;Britons continue to dig their own grave because they want high [American] standards without investing the work and sacrifice their predecessors put in to create them.&rsquo; In other words, &#8216;Gimme what you worked for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Exactly the same as is happening here.</p>

		<p>I doubt that the Tory regime will actually do anything to reduce immigration.  They say they have a plan to cut non-EU immigration.  When are they going to implement it?  How are they going to deal with importation of spouses from India and Pakistan that is the biggest source of non-white immigration into the UK?  Are they going to reduce the number of Eastern Europeans coming in?  How are they going to reduce the number of &#8220;asylum seekers?&#8221;  This is likely just hot air.  Remember that the Blair regime handled immigration by repeatedly claiming that they were about to &#8220;crack down on bogus refugees&#8221; and then never actually did anything.  </p>
