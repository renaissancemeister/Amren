			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Selna, San Francisco Chronicle, August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A review of the damage wreaked on California communities by the housing bust shows that Latino households suffered nearly 50 percent of the foreclosures and that loan defaults are concentrated in the state&rsquo;s Central Valley.</p>
<p>That area, which includes the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, features six of the top 10 California metro areas for foreclosure concentrations, according to the Center for Responsible Lending, which released a comprehensive report Tuesday.</p>
<p>No California communities have experienced a higher percentage of defaults than Modesto, Merced and Stockton  &mdash;  each of which had a foreclosure percentage of around 16 percent between late 2006 and 2009, the study found.</p>
<p>&#8220;The signature finding of this report, that there is a disproportionate rate of foreclosures for Latinos, is really stunning,&#8221; said Paul Leonard, director of the California office for the Center for Responsible Lending. &#8220;The data shows that high-cost loans correlate with foreclosures and that there was a big presence of subprime lending to the (Latino) demographic and in areas where there are concentrations of Latinos.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to fair lending practices, reported that minorities and remote suburbs  &mdash;  where incomes did not keep pace with escalating housing prices and unemployment has been high  &mdash;  were disproportionately represented in loan defaults.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s report also says that Latinos, who represent 36.6 percent of California&rsquo;s population, received 29.9 percent of all mortgage loans originated between 2004 and 2008, but were subject to 48.7 percent of foreclosures.</p>
<p>Latinos&rsquo; share of higher-rate loans in California was 47.1 percent between 2004 and 2008, which correlates with general discriminatory lending practices at the time, the report said.</p>
<p>According to the study, it is well-documented that Latino and African American families disproportionately received the most expensive and risky types of loans during the subprime lending boom. In 2006, for instance, federal figures show that among consumers who received conventional mortgages for single-family homes, roughly half of African Americans and Hispanic borrowers received a higher-rate mortgage compared with about 18 percent of white borrowers.<br/>

<p>How about:  &#8220;Latinos most likely to default on loans&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The bankers will be blamed for this, we all know.  Never mind that they would have been sued for discrimination had they not given mortgages to deadbeat Latinos.  Indeed, some banks gave mortgages to people they knew were illegal immigrants   &mdash;   all with the blessings of the liberals.  Only conservatives objected to this practice, and got called racist and nativist for their trouble.</p>
<p>Latinos did get disproportionately more of the higher rate loans.  That&rsquo;s because they were a bigger risk, as the mortgage crisis has made all too plain.  Anyhow, nobody put a gun to their head and made them take out a loan they didn&rsquo;t want.  If they read the contract and agreed to the terms they have no basis for complaint.  If they didn&rsquo;t read the contract they have learned the hard way why they should.</p>

		<p>Those with the lowest credit ratings always pay the highest rates to compensate for expected defaults.  Thus to say &#8220;The data shows that high-cost loans correlate with foreclosures&#8221; is the same as saying lending to high credit risk borrowers correlates with foreclosures.  Duh.  Of course this could have all been avoided if home buyers were required to put 20% down on the house.  It would prove they can save, and should they have income issues later, the 20% provides a cushion for the lender.  But government had a better idea.</p>

<p>As if that would make any difference when people lie about their income, their credit, and their souce of downpayment - as if they even made one! These factors are the true source of the problem. It&rsquo;s not about discriminatory loans or some bad bank or loan officer conning them! Baloney! Most of these people conned themselves. They knew that they couldn&rsquo;t afford the house they were buying, but they let someone tell them, &#8220;you deserve that house, Pablo!&#8221; So they bought the house and counted on some miracle to somehow bring them through. Now that they can&rsquo;t afford it, they&rsquo;re being cheated out of their &#8220;American dream!&#8221; Hooey! What a lot of nonsense. </p>
<p>Now they have all of these &#8220;advocates&#8221; who want to help them stay in the houses because the &#8220;advocates&#8221; know that they can&rsquo;t afford to foreclose on them. If the &#8220;advocates&#8221; (translation big bank executives) foreclose on them they&rsquo;ll be sitting on a wasteland of bad real estate. That&rsquo;s the only reason that the good Senators and Congressmen want to help the poor people stay in the houses. They know that their real money bags, the big bankers, will go broke if they have to eat all of those houses. So they&rsquo;ll keep Pablo in his house at the expense of the average taxpayer like me. Some justice in the Land of the Free, Huh? Where&rsquo;s my &#8220;American Dream?&#8221; Every break I&rsquo;ve received I&rsquo;ve earned! No one ever came to me and said, &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t pay for that house, call this 800 number, and we&rsquo;ll fix things for you!&#8221; I have more to say, but you don&rsquo;t want to read my expletives!</p>

		<p>This was a scam from the beginning by realtors who knew that minorities would be given loans from banks to meet the government quotas. A person did not need to be a citizen to get a loan.  </p>
<p>Everyone involved in the loan process made fortunes knowing that this was a joke.  I personally know of one person who bought three homes in LA and couldn&rsquo;t qualify for one. The Realtors were giving kickbacks to buyers who could care less because the buyers weren&rsquo;t citizens. </p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t figure it out until the bubble burst. The fraud was so huge that it was easier to look the other way and sweep it all too the tax payers burden.</p>
<p>Now this tear jerking is being publicized. Unbelievable.</p>

		<p>Noted internet pundit Steve Sailor has been going on about this for quite some time - and it appears that he is correct - that the global financial meltdown of 2008 to present that has inflicted such devastating economic damage worldwide was primarily engendered by the mass importation of low-skilled, low earning immigrants to the USA, and the US Governments naive ignorance in encouraging them to buy homes with mortgages.<br/>
     The irony is that &#8216;smart&rsquo; economists and their political acolytes to tel us agian and again that the huge growth of unskilled immigrant &#8216;workers&rsquo; will &#8216;ensure&rsquo; the USA&rsquo;s economic future.</p>

		<p>  What&rsquo;s surprising about high rates of Hispanic forclosures in California? Carter&rsquo;s Community Reinvestment Act and George Bushes &#8220;birng home ownership to minorities program&#8221; is responsible for this whole mess. Loans were made to Hispanics without or with minimal downpayments, and with little credit history checking, to boast minority home ownership. The result was massive housing defaults. </p>

		<p>Please remember the Dream Act. It was G.W.Bush who sought the ultimate compassionate consevative approach by pushing people like Angelo Mozilo, from Country Wide and other nefarious entities, to make these loans. Why did he do this? Simple, Hispandering and votes from minorities. Placing these groups in homes would create good little conservatives. Notice that the &#8220;Housing Crisis&#8221; began in the sand states. The historic population has been made to pay for an utter failure in social engineering, yet again. The demographic timebomb of &#8220;The Lion of the Senate,&#8221; Ted Kennedy, will signal the end. Ethnopolitics shall rule this country and one group is finally seeing the light. Keep up the good work!</p>

		<p>This does not surprise me at all.  There are several reasons as to why there is a higher percentage of foreclosures in Hispanic communities.  The two major reasons for such a high percentage of foreclosures   among Hispanic compared to Whites. The first reason is because Hispanics are given higher interest rate home loans and the second reason is because they are the first ones to get laid off from the employers.   There are several studies which show that Hispanic with the same income level and credit score receive a higher interest rate for their home loans than whites with the same exact income and credit.  I live in a middle class neighborhood which is half Hispanic and half White.  Most of the Whites that live in our neighborhood are blue collar workers and most of the Hispanics are Professionals with College Educations. For some strange reason, these White people that work as water deliverymen, housekeepers, mechanics, landscapers and other manual labor type jobs  can afford to pay for their mortgage, their car payments and own RVs on lower salaries.  </p>
<p>I have had conversations with my White neighbors about this strange phenomenon and turns out that they can afford for all their material wealth because they have lower interest rate loans for everything they buy.  They don&rsquo;t have the lower interest rates because of their great credit, so what other reason would enable some of them to buy a $150,000 RV and a nice home?  Oh, could it be the color of their skin? <br/>

<p>I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that non-whites were recipients of mortgages they could not qualify for if they were white, because of low income and bad credit?</p>

		<p>Anyone who has taken even a basic course in finance immediately learns the concept of &#8220;risk/reward&#8221;. The greater the risk to the investor the higher return he will expect to make from the investment.  Ultimately the investors, banks and others who loaned money to Latinos to purchase homes, simply underestimated the risk of loaning them money and should instead have charged significantly higher rates to have made a profit on the group as a whole.</p>

<p> Actually, they do have lower interest rates because of better credit ratings and higher down payments. They also have traceable credit histories. Banks don&rsquo;t give a dam about what color you are as long as you can meet their loan criteria. Everything is based on how much risk the bank thinks they are taking on the loan. My father was an officer in the South Carolina Bank for over thirty years.  </p>
