<h1>Justice Department Steers Money to Favored Groups</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Byron York, Washington Examiner, August 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department has found a new way to pursue civil rights lawsuits, using the powers of the Civil Rights Division not just to win compensation for victims of alleged discrimination but also to direct large sums of money to activist groups that are not discrimination victims and not connected to a particular suit.</p>
<p>In the past, when the Civil Rights Division filed suit against, say, a bank or a landlord, alleging discrimination in lending or rentals, the cases were often settled by the defendant paying a fine to the U.S. Treasury and agreeing to put aside a sum of money to compensate the alleged discrimination victims. There was then a search for those victims  &mdash;  people who were actually denied a loan or an apartment  &mdash;  who stood to be compensated. After everyone who could be found was paid, there was often money left over. That money was returned to the defendant.</p>
<p>Now, Attorney General Eric Holder and Civil Rights Division chief Thomas Perez have a new plan. Any unspent money will not go back to the defendant but will instead go to a &#8220;qualified organization&#8221; approved by the Justice Department. And if there is not enough unspent money  &mdash;  that will be determined by the Department  &mdash;  then the defendant might be required to come up with more money to give to the &#8220;qualified organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrangement was used in a recently-settled case, United States v. AIG Federal Savings Bank and Wilmington Finance. The Justice Department alleged that AIG violated the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by allowing third-party wholesale mortgage brokers to &#8220;charge African-American borrowers higher direct broker fees for residential real estate-related loans than white borrowers.&#8221; The financial institution denied any wrongdoing, and there was no factual finding of wrongdoing. Nevertheless, under the terms of a March 19, 2010 consent decree, AIG agreed to pay $6.1 million to &#8220;aggrieved persons who may have suffered as a result of the alleged violations.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is standard procedure in such cases. But then AIG also agreed, in the words of the consent decree, to &#8220;provide a minimum of $1,000,000 to qualified organization(s) to provide credit counseling, financial literacy, and other related educational programs targeted at African-American borrowers.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>The consent decree directs AIG to consult with the Justice Department on which &#8220;qualified organizations&#8221; could receive money, and it gives the Department the right to approve where the money will go. In any event, the money will go to groups who have no direct connection to the lawsuit and its allegations of discrimination.</p>
<p>Xochitl Hinojosa, a Justice Department spokeswoman, says no money has yet been given to organizations under the AIG agreement. But she adds that the funds, and those from other cases, will &#8220;go to &#8216;qualified organizations&rsquo; that have a mission that addresses whatever the harm is that was the subject of the litigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Department followed a similar procedure in another case, United States v. Sterling [2009]. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hinojosa says that in the Sterling case, $40,000 will be split between the victim fund administrator and a group called the Southern California Housing Rights Center. According to the Center&rsquo;s website, its goal is to promote &#8220;freedom of residence&#8221; through the use of &#8220;education, advocacy and litigation.&#8221; Thus, money used to settle a lawsuit over alleged discrimination might well go to fund yet another lawsuit over alleged discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans are particularly concerned that the &#8220;qualified organizations&#8221; money might end up with groups that are associated with the community organizing group formerly known as ACORN. Republican lawmakers want to avoid sending federal money to groups that Congress has deemed unsuitable to receive it.</p>

		<p>What a chash-cow racket this whole race flim-flam truly is! Seems combating &#8220;racism&#8221; is a very, very lucrative business&hellip;how remarkably convenient for all those non-whites who magically profit by all this &#8220;discrimination.&#8221; </p>

And just what does &#8220;no factual finding of wrong doing&#8221; mean anyway? &#8220;ok, your&rsquo;re not guilty, we want you to pay up anyway&#8221;</p>

		<p>What an outrage! The Obama regime will shake down successful businesses w/baseless charges of discrimination and distribute part of the booty to leftist rabble-rousers.</p>
<p>And the GOP has no problem as long as no $ goes to ACORN?</p>

<p>This is like the O.J.Simpson trial. I have no love for O.J. but the disturbing part of the whole trial, which escaped many people, was that he was found innocent by a jury and yet further prosecuted AND convicted of &#8220;wrongful death&#8221;! Just what is &#8220;wrongful death&#8221; When the jury found him innocent, the game should have ended there, but is is a classic case of semantics, if we can&rsquo;t get a conviction spelling the charges like this, we will spell them like THAT! on and on until we get a conviction. This style of prosecution is what is going to be used against Whites more and more in the future to find us guilty of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; and send us to GITMO! which is where White dissidents will be sent more and more often I think&hellip;get us off of U.S. soil and the protection our legal system provides, such as it is for Whites at the moment, and that protection reducing exponentially year to year.</p>

		<p>This is a shake-down racket but not in the way many people probably realize. Politicians and bureaucrats are using tax dollars (ie Justice Department) to harrass companies into settlements (ie extortion) and directing that money to pet organizations who in turn will no doubt funnel some of that money back to political candidates. Since campaign donations often influence the outcome of elections this is nothing more than creating their own personal &#8220;slush fund&#8221;. I&rsquo;ll bet you want see Soros.. Oops! I mean McCain-Feingold.. pushing a campaign finance &#8220;reform&#8221; bill to cover this. But I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see it eventually taken up by the Supreme Court.</p>

		<p>The only answer is to have no business contacts with minorities.  Do not hire any.  Do not live near any.  Do not patronize their businesses.  How can this be done in a way to avoid the shakedowns?</p>
<p>1) Private banks that lend only to members can be set up, and make the criteria for membership based on something that minorities cannot meet.  For example, a bank for the descendants of so-and-so from 200 years ago, or a private lending pool, privately administered that does not accept applications but instead finds clients on its own through word of mouth.  Register the business in a foreign country if you have to.  There are many creative ideas that can be done.  Emphasis is on private, membership and non-public access.</p>
<p>2)  Do not buy houses in or live in towns with minorities.  If you or a neighbor wants to sell their house, use a hidden, private system of word-of-mouth selling.  In other words, completely underground. No public notice, no mls listings.  Keep it in-house.  For sale by owner and with the help of friends cannot be sued for discrimination.  Same goes for rentals.  Informal local network, perhaps with someone acting as the clearinghouse.</p>
<p>3) Do not hire any minority employees.  To get around hiring lawsuits, do not advertise the position in a public forum.  Do not put up help wanted signs.  Do everything word-of-mouth.  It will be difficult for large enterprises, but not for smaller ones.</p>
<p>4)  Shun.  I mean completely ostracize and shun ANY person in your neighborhood who hires illegal aliens, immigrants or non-whites to work in their business.  Boycott it, informally, and make sure no one has social intercourse with such people.</p>
<p>5)  Never patronize any business owned by a minority person, unless they have demonstrated they are assimilated.</p>
<p>6)  Do not put your kids in &#8216;integrated&rsquo; schools so your daughters can be the target of black boys and your sons turn into gang-sign-flashing voodoo wannabes.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s one more racket in a long series of government rackets. Add this on to asset forfeiture and eminent domain abuse. The US government is becoming a kleptocracy, with some of the lucre spread out among the clients to keep them propping up the system. </p>
<p>Remember when we had a Republic?</p>
<p>Sigh&hellip;</p>
<p><i>have no love for O.J. but the disturbing part of the whole trial, which escaped many people, was that he was found innocent by a jury and yet further prosecuted AND convicted of &ldquo;wrongful death&rdquo;! </i></p>
<p>Good point. </p>
