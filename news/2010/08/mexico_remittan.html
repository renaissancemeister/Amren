<h1>Mexico: Remittances Drop 4 Percent in 1st Half of 2010</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Houston Chronicle, August 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico&rsquo;s central bank says the amount of money migrant workers sent home in the first half of 2010 fell 4.1 percent compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p>Remittances totaled $10.63 billion in the first six months, down from $11.1 billion in the first half of 2009.</p>

		<p>Someone here at AR posited a theory that I have come to agree with the more I read   &mdash;   A lot of these remittances were chunks of a large subprime mortgage.  E.g. Juan the strawberry picker, &#8220;claiming&#8221; he made $14,000 a year, got a $700,000 mortgage with no down payment.  He remitted half of it back to his relatives in Mexico, and used the other half to buy a sardine can with a foundation.  </p>
<p>These remittances might be down because there are no more of these affirmative action mortgages being drawn.</p>

		<p>This is another way the illegals are robbing us.  They underbid Americans for jobs, then instead of spending their pay here to help our economy, they send it to Mexico.<br>

		<p>Mexico will do anything, say anything, charge any kind of qualification of racism, engage in subtefuge in America, ANYTHING, to keep those billions coming in.  But they are coming out of our nation&rsquo;s wealth pool and not coming back.  This along with the tax dollars lost on free food, medical services, crime fighting, real losses of property due to crimes, PLUS hurt and lost lives due to the crime they bring with them.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstand home mortgages. Buyer&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t get cash when they sign a note.<br>
The bank  grants them a deed in return for the promissory note to PAY the money back. There&rsquo;s no money to remit. Pedro has to PAY seven hundred thousand, plus interest, insurance and taxes.<br>
If you know of mortgages that work the way you described, please do tell me where to get one!</p>

		<p>I have noticed that illegals always have money to send back to the home country but never any to pay medical bills.  I also agree that the remittances should be taxed   &mdash;   I believe this could be done as most illegals do this through money orders or wire transfer.  The Fed&rsquo;s could also recoup some of the burden of illegals by with-holding funds from whatever country they are from for the express purpose of defraying the cost of paying for their medical expenses, education and jail upkeep.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean it in the sense that they get the cash, but they were able to remit some part of the credit instrument back to Mexico.</p>

		<p>#5, But the illegals did take out a lot of home equity loans as their property values increased during the housing bubble. They sent this money back to Mexico and walked away from their houses when the housing market crashed.</p>
