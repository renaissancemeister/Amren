			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Noel Sheppard, NewsBusters, August 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Juan Williams on Sunday said the passage of Missouri&rsquo;s anti-ObamaCare ballot initiative last week is irrelevant because only older white people voted for it.</p>
<p>Discussing the issue on &#8220;Fox News Sunday,&#8221; the liberal FNC contributor said, &#8220;As far as the Missouri vote, you get 70 percent inside an echo chamber of older white people, no not in St. Louis not in Kansas City, saying, &#8216;Oh yeah, we don&rsquo;t like a requirement that everybody has to have healthcare even though the hospitals in Missouri say it&rsquo;s gonna drive up our costs.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Host Chris Wallace seemed somewhat stunned by this and asked, &#8220;What happened to respect for democracy?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Williams elaborated saying that he believes this will eventually be decided by the courts, Liz Cheney rightly scolded her colleague, &#8220;I think it is stunning you and the White House are unwilling to heed the votes of the people in Missouri&#8221; {snip}</p>

		<p>I was not aware that 668,000 Missourians were old white people.</p>
<p>Just for Juan Williams&rsquo;s information, while Prop C did not win in St. Louis and Kansas City, it got 41 and 43 percent of the vote there, respectively.  These are cities that are 80% Democrat in Presidential politics.  In St. Louis&rsquo;s almost all-black precincts, it got 25-30% yes.  </p>
<p>I debunked some other bromides about Prop C the day after the vote:</p>

		<p>Black solidarity, non-White solidarity = rich, vibrant, cohesive community.</p>
<p>White solidarity = racist, domestic terrorist, echo chamber, gun/bible/religion-clinging.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get it, White Man?  The elites have been suppressing White pride, solidarity, and expression for decades.  White Men are the greatest threats to the elite agenda.</p>
<p>White Man, have YOU realized that it is VITAL to be unabashedly PRO-WHITE?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Old White People&#8221; were exactly the type to most benefit<br>
from Obamacare. So why do Old White People  reject it? Because they dont want to bankrupt the country. They want to preserve<br>
American sense of independence and self reliance. In other words<br>
they love America for more than what they can squeeze out of it.<br>
Of course this goes completely over the head of this<br>
black socialist piece of garbage. He knows America is <br>
there to exploit, and destroy. Welcome to the reality of <br>
black thinking and black politics. </p>

		<p>This black has the NERVE to accuse white elderly folks for &#8220;voting in an echo chamber&#8221;????  A BLACK has the nerve to accuse ANYBODY of that?  The blacks knee-jerk, robotically vote for the Dems en masse.  Always.  And if the Dem is a black guy, then they will vote for the black Dem over any other Dem.  Always.  It&rsquo;s so predictable as to be ridiculous.</p>
<p>Moreover, isn&rsquo;t it interesting that the gays, blacks, liberals and Dems always fall back and take comfort in the &#8220;courts&#8221; nullifying the will of the people as guaranteed?  The courts are so stacked with liberal appointees that judicial activism is the norm, and they take comfort in that overthrow of the Constitutional checks and balances.  Only because it goes THEIR way most often.  You would hear them scream if the courts had been stacked the other way in our favor.  You betcha.  But they aren&rsquo;t and you can thank the RINO Republicans for the way the courts have been stacked.  Blame it on them, not on the Dems.  This black low brow brutha and his liberal brethren have no clue what they are building toward.  When the citizens of a society cannot trust their government, cannot trust their courts and judges, cannot trust their police administrators to govern by Constitutional law and abandon all pretense of doing so, there is only ONE remedy left the citizens of any society.<br>
And that is NEVER pretty, and almost always sweeps wide.  The fact that these buffoons are so willing to bring us to that brink makes me purely boil.</p>

		<p>This is somewhat disappointing, but not surprising; although I usually disagree with his take on things, he can be more reasonable than the average liberal.  It just goes to show you that the Left is all about the democratic process, as long as the results go their way; otherwise, they try to overrule the voters.  </p>

		<p>Juan Williams is the only black I&rsquo;ve ever watched, listened to, or read, that could talk on the same level as the average white; however, his mindset is strictly pro-black.  Because his requirements at Fox are that he be more broadminded than the average black racist, he says things sometimes that smack of fairnesss. </p>
<p>But, first, last and always, this man is like all other blacks:  He&rsquo;s a pro-black bigot.</p>
<p>As long as blacks are included, no white society can really be successful.  If blacks donb&rsquo;t dumb down the level of discussion, they are so biased their opinions are less than worthless.</p>

		<p>On issues whose prime benefit extends to African-Americans, blacks will vote in the neighborhood of 95% and upwards.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I know of no issue where white people are that organized and unilateral over.</p>
<p>Going by this commentator&rsquo;s logic, shouldn&rsquo;t it be the black votes that are disregarded?</p>

		<p>The Obama Administration is remarkable in the record time that black leaders, individuals, and commentators like Williams took to reveal their innate despotic tendancies.  They show tendancies that closely mimic many black leaders in Africa who have mangled the event of their own emancipation from colonialism to become regimes that have nothing to do with democracy.  It is as if they were only waiting for the event of a black president to reveal their true disbelief in representative government. </p>

		<p>There is some truth to this.  In a few years, when the baby boomers start dying off and the children recent illegal and non-citizen immigrants are old enough to vote, the racial balance of the electorate is going to start changing much faster than it is now.  We can expect it to become increasingly hard for conservative policies and politicians win at the polls.  </p>
