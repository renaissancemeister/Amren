			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ReliefWeb (New York), August 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten million people across the Sahel region of West Africa are facing acute food shortages, according to Christian relief and development agency Tearfund.</p>
<p>Jo Khinmaung, Food Security Adviser for development agency Tearfund, who is just back from Chad, says, &#8216;People are eating wild leaves, roots and tubers straight away, without soaking them in water for a few days because they are so desperately hungry, which is causing all manner of health problems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nearly 8 million people are affected in Niger  &mdash;  almost half the population. This is far worse than the 2005 food crisis in a country where most people rely on farming or herding. In neighbouring Chad, some 2 million need humanitarian assistance, while hundreds of thousands face food shortages in Burkina Faso, Mali and northern Nigeria.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Recent malnutrition surveys show that over 20 per cent of children under five are acutely malnourished in parts of Chad and 17 per cent across Niger  &mdash;  both above the 15 per cent emergency threshold.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Jo Khinmaung] added, &#8216;Much of the livestock, on which people depend, have died and carcasses can be seen piled up in the worst affected regions. Families would normally trade their cattle for food  &mdash;  but those that remain are so weak they are not worth enough. This means families have no money, and many people are eating just one meal a day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since last November, when warnings of this imminent crisis in the region were largely ignored, a combination of slow and insufficient funding from international donors and soaring prices has intensified the food crisis.</p>
<p>Jo Khinmaung said, &#8216;With more attention and funding, this crisis could and should have been prevented. What&rsquo;s happening right now in the Sahel is a food crisis that is twice as catastrophic as that see in Niger in 2005. The international community seems to be repeating the same mistakes it made then, by responding with too little and too late.</p>

<p>Sorry, Jo, but you&rsquo;re ignoring the source of the problem.  With more intelligence, planning and hard work on the part of the po&rsquo;, po&rsquo; Africans, this neverending &#8220;crisis&#8221; never would have happened in the first place.  Starvation and misery has been a fact of life in Africa for as long as anyone has been keeping records.  Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; Africa is populated by blacks, and Africa is in a state of perpetual famine.  Could there possibly be a correlation somewhere?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;What&rsquo;s happening right now in the Sahel is a food crisis that is twice as catastrophic as that seen in Niger in 2005.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>And the next &#8220;food crisis&#8221; will be twice again as severe, and the one after that will be four times more severe, and the one after that&hellip;  </p>
<p>Famine, thy name is Africa.  No matter how many handouts they get from a guilt-ridden West, the starvation <i>never</i> ends.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The international community seems to be repeating the same mistakes it made then, by responding with too little and too late.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Sorry, Jo, but it&rsquo;s <i>the Africans themselves</i> who are repeating the same old mistakes over and over.  Stop expecting &#8220;the international community&#8221; to bail you out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick and tired of this old, old round of &#8220;Feeds us, Bwana,&#8221; followed by &#8220;We hate you, you filthy Racist Western Oppressor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Note how it is the &#8220;international community&#8221; (read the White world) that is &#8220;making the mistake&#8221; not the people who have actually caused this problem - the Africans themselves. </p>
<p>I would say the real MISTAKE the &#8220;international community&#8221; is making is in responding at all. Too many people who have foolishly reproduced too much in an ecologically vulnerable area. Let nature take its course.</p>

		<p>The Sahel region is semi-desert.  As such it can support only a very low human population.  Africans over-breed,which reduces the food and water available per person, causing famine.  </p>
<p>Africans in the Sahel region could have a wonderful life if only their population was about 10% of what it is now.  Famine is nature&rsquo;s way of bringing populations back under carrying capacity.  It is &#8220;organic&#8221; and &#8220;natural&#8221;, and we should not interfere with Mother nature.  Nature will fix this problem, if we just let it run its course.  Feeding these people is an incredible act of cruelity, because it will cause increased births, which will cause increased competition for scarce resources, which will lead to increased misery.</p>
<p>If you have a heart, do NOT feed people who have overpopulated their homeland. That only repeats the cycle.  Instead work to permanently reduce the birth rate, so that a lower population can live a higher standard of living.  </p>

		<p>This article is written by a person who has invested interest in the aid program.  Usually, the people having foreign aid forced on them are never encouraged or taught to be self sufficient.  They did just fine prior to any kind of foreign aid.  Actually, probably better because they knew they had to actually work in order to survive which led to innovation just as nature intended.  This same analogy applies in this country.  The blacks in this country actually made more educational and economic progress prior to affirmative action, etc.  The entitlement mentality have not worked both for the giver and receiver.  There is a reason why nature has never given without earning for it.    </p>

		<p>Back in 1985 when we were hearing the endless airplay of &#8220;We are the World&#8221;, one lone voice said more about the idiocy of trying to feed Africa than the day when every station known to man played that song. Sam Kinison summed it up best when he appeared on David Letterman and went through his routine about &#8220;Don&rsquo;t give these people food, give them luggage. You see what this is, it&rsquo;s sand. You know what it&rsquo;s going to be in 100 years, SAND! You people live in the desert, move to where the food is!&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1348-49 when Europe was suffering from black death; if there was starvation of biblical proportions in Africa during that same time frame, I guess that by liberal logic it was Europe&rsquo;s fault. Let&rsquo;s invert the situation; does anyone ever stop to ask how Hong Kong or Singapore survive even though there is no farmland or natural resources whatsoever in those countries? Near the major metropolitan area where I live, I can&rsquo;t say that I have seen too many people of color who look like they are starving to death. I saw one fellow at the local Big Box Mart who weighed between 350 &amp; 400 wearing a T-shirt that said &#8220;I beat Anorexia&#8221;. Those 200 extra pounds may end up serving him well when the system collapses.     </p>
<p>&#8220;On the morning of April 5, 1985 (Good Friday of that year), &#8220;We Are the World&#8221; received worldwide coverage. At 10:25 am, over 8000 radio stations simultaneously broadcast the song around the world. They played it to show their support for the relief of famine in Ethiopia.&#8221;   From Wikipedia</p>

		<p>Howard W. Campbell:</p>
<p>The proof of everything you say is in the numbers.  At the time WATW was released, there were 26 million people in Ethiopia, most of them were starving.  Just a few years ago, there were 78 million people in Ethiopia, most of them were starving.  And that&rsquo;s not a fair comparison because Eritrea split away from Ethiopia some time after 1985.</p>

		<p>All very good and factual comments, posters.</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t forget the TV ads for decades now from all these &#8220;Christian&#8221; orgs begging for more $$$ year after year after year! &#8220;just send $19 a month to feed, medicate, educate this poor starving child (shows pictures of African kids with tears in their eyes)&#8221; and all will be well. You will even be getting a &#8220;letter&#8221; from &#8220;your&#8221; child&hellip;. I even fell for that one year about 30 years ago and &#8220;adopted&#8221; a Sri Lanka girl..until I became wise to the rip-off and became more racially aware. </p>
<p> I got letter alright and it was obvious I did not have an &#8220;adopted&#8221; child from Sri Lanka. They even send you a picture of some girl or another. They even had the nerve to ask me if I would pay to have her come to my home for a &#8220;visit&#8221;!!!!! </p>
<p>They say it is OUR duty as &#8220;Christians&#8221; to be our &#8220;brothers keeper&#8221;.  Really? First please tell me WHO really are our brothers????? </p>

		<p>Famines are inevitable and completely natural. They are only a problem when a society is not organized and declines to set aside foodstocks to guard against it. Such a society is almost always overpopulated. Famine is thus a natural check as Thomas Malthus pointed out. </p>

		<p>I said before and say again, for a true idea of what happens to ANY aid of ANY kind sent to Africa, ANY part of Africa, see the opening scenes of the movie &#8220;Blackhawk Down&#8221; the is EXACTLY what happens. The deserts of Africa were not always deserts, muslims with their goats and sheep made the deserts.</p>

		<p>Having lived in Africa for 23 years albeit in the wealthy part until Apartheid was abolished, I can tell you Africa will never be self supporting.  Only the farms operated by the European settlers are producing.  After living there for two or three hundred years they became white Africans but they were or are being forced out and their farms stolen by the ex-terrorist politicians.  Rhodesia fed the sub continent along with South Africa.  Now those countries are either finished (Zimbabwe) or well on the way, expecting massive claims for reparations as the West &#8220;is responsible for global warming&#8221; and therefore their famines, forgetting of course that they have always existed in Africa until the Europeans came along.<br>
Africa has to level out until the numbers of people that the continent can sustain on its own as been reached.  It is called Mother Nature or God&rsquo;s will. </p>

		<p>The comments here may seem heartless, but they are spot on. For context, please reread a couple of articles from two years ago by Irish journalist Kevin Myers about the famine in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>From the Irish <em>Independent</em>.</p>
<p>And the Belfast <a href="https://tinyurl.com/247lbun" rel="nofollow"><em>Telegraph</em>.</a></p>
<p>Misguided charity from the West is setting Africa up for a catastrophe that will dwarf all the wars of the 20th century. It is not only inflating populations that are already far above sustainable levels, it is destroying local agriculture. Farmers can&rsquo;t compete against free food.</p>
<p>Please; stop feeding them.</p>

		<p>  I wonder if there is a Relief Web Peking. After all China has 2.5 trillion dollars in the treasury. But it is funny that you never hear of any food aid drive from China,Korea,Japan,or Saudi Arabia. Only the white suckers of the West  help, and in the end there is no gratitude from these people. People who are ungrateful are the worst.</p>

<p>You are blaming the wrong people here. As far as I am aware, Africans are not the ones organizing international appeals for food aid. Those appeals are being organized by white people working for Western NGOs, who have turned foreign aid into a huge multi-billion dollar business. Those international NGOs such as CARE, WFP, OXFAM, and others, operate with the ruthlessness of big oil corporations, banks, and defence contractors. The Western NGOs have partnerships with huge agro-business corporations in North America and Europe, and they dump their excess subsidized food in Africa and other third world nations.</p>
<p>The international foreign aid NGOs are more corrupt than Goldman Sachs, yet, they present themselves as compassionate humanitarians with their hypocritical and diabolical tear-jerking appeals for money. Jesse Jackson is a model of ethical behavior, compared to those corrupt NGOs. The NGOs are so powerful, that they were able to influence America to send troops to Somalia in 1993, to act as bodyguards for their aid operations. Those NGOs have blood on their hands, in that they caused American troops to die in an unnecessary conflict in Somalia, as we all saw in the movie &#8220;Black Hawk Down&#8221;.</p>
<p>What is worse, is that the free food is subsidizing the breeding of blacks, who are making their way to Europe. Whites are breeding the people who will destroy their civilization. But this breeding of blacks is also harmful to the blacks themselves, because it prevents their population from falling to the level which can be sustained by their environments. White people treat black Africans worse than they treat animals. In South Africa, whenever they have an excess population of elephants, they cull the herds, to ensure that the elephants do not suffer from mass starvation. The numbers of elephants do not exceed the number that can be supported by their environment.</p>
<p>Instead of allowing blacks to reach their natural population level by allowing them to fend for themselves, white people, by supplying food aid, cause blacks to endure mass starvation that they would never accept in elephant populations. Anybody who gives money to aid appeals for Africa, is either a fool, or a cruel sadist.</p>

		<p>The only &#8220;aid&#8221; anyone should send to the Sahel region of West Africa is birth control pills.<br>
  <br>
Sending food only exasperates the problem black Africans have of birthing more offspring than they can feed.  </p>
<p>Food sent to black Africa is stolen by their local governments and sold to other African nations.  </p>
<p>Almost all blacks, once they&rsquo;ve lived off of whites, quickly believe it is our responsibility to provide for their needs forever.  </p>
<p>We must stay out of black Africa and let nature take its course as it has for  millennia.        </p>

		<p>As Volkmar Weiss pointed out - if the average IQ is too low, a people simply cannot run an effective modern society. If the pool of people who can be lawyers, doctors, engineers, scientists is too small a fraction only certain types of society are feasible.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking there are two intelligent races (the TDIs [triple digit IQ]) and one feeble-minded race (the DDIs [double digit IQ]). Two of the main races have an average IQ of over 100, the other one is more than 10 units below 100.<br>
DDIs simply cannot run an effective modern society – the pool of people for certain jobs does not suffice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no way to change that.</p>
