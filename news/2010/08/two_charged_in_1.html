<h1>Two Charged in &#8216;Very Disturbing&rsquo; Maryland Killings</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, August 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two people were charged Saturday in &#8220;very disturbing&#8221; drug-related killings of two young children and two adult relatives outside Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Darrell Lynn Bellard, 43, of Dickinson, Texas, and Tkeisha Nicole Gilmer, 18, of Texas City, Texas were taken into custody Friday and charged with first-degree murder, police in Prince George&rsquo;s County, Maryland, told CNN. More charges are being considered.</p>
<p>The incident took place Friday at a debris-filled living space in Lanham, Maryland, a crime scene that Police Chief Roberto Hylton described as &#8220;horrific.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victims have been identified Shayla Shante, 3, and Shakur Sylvester Sikyala, 4, both slain along with their mother, Dawn Yvette Brooks, 38, and their aunt, Mwasiti Sikyala, 41. Police said some of the victims may have been Congolese.</p>
<p>Hylton told CNN Saturday that the suspects and the victims were part of a &#8220;drug sales relationship and something went wrong.&#8221; Police said they were selling marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were executed. They were shot multiple times&#8221; and the manner in which the children were slain was &#8220;very disturbing,&#8221; Hylton said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police described a living space above a house&rsquo;s garage that had no running water, air-conditioning or toilets, and was strewn with trash and containers of feces.</p>
<p>Officers had been given specialized outfits and equipment to help clear the debris.</p>

		<p>This behavior is not part of ANY civilized society. If it was an isolated occurrence one might say the grisly participants were mentally ill or under the influence of drugs. However, this &#8220;very disturbing&#8221; incident sounds similar to too many other similar &#8220;disturbing incidents&#8221; in which blacks are involved.</p>
<p>How much longer can the US survive paying for and cleaning up the mess that blacks leave in their wake? I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is under current law but unless something is done soon there won&rsquo;t be any law left.  </p>

		<p>This crime happened in Prince George&rsquo;s County (known locally as Purely Ghetto County), which has the misfortune to back up geographically to the most crime ridden areas of Washington DC. Most Whites fled this area years ago and it is a Black run county   &mdash;   meaning it is a mess.  It is full of criminal&rsquo;s and Black government workers and like Washington DC would be another Detroit if it were not for the overall wealth of the region.  </p>
<p>Montgomery County which resides on the wealthy side of Washington is a totally different place but is now on the long slide downward due to an influx of Blacks, homegrown and imported from Africa, along with huge numbers of Hispanic&rsquo;s both legal and illegal.  Many people are fleeing this high dollar county   &mdash;   some even moving to West Virginia and PA   &mdash;   as soon as I can bail I will.   </p>

		<p>They must have had excellent reasons for killing three-year-old Shayla and four-year-old Shakur. Everyone knows that blacks don&rsquo;t just run around slaughtering people for no reason. Perhaps the tots subjected them to racist taunts.</p>

<p>But why don&rsquo;t the Kennedys ever invite all these African immigrants to their &#8220;compound&#8221; in Maine?  Ever seen a photo of Teddy on his yatch with an African along for the ride?</p>

		<p> When I heard the first news reports about this horrific case   &mdash;   four killed in a house, which beggared description for its dirt and vileness   &mdash;   the first thing I thought of was, &#8220;It was blacks, killing blacks.&#8221; Looks like my hunch was right.</p>

<p>NO, it was not &#8220;something gone wrong&#8221;. This is what the perps intended to do. They did it with premeditation and evidently relish. NOTHING went wrong. The &#8220;deal&#8221; went down as intended.</p>

		<p>Nothing will stop this nation&rsquo;s freefall into madness and horror.<br>
The deed is done, and demographics are indeed destiny.<br>
I just want to turn my back on it all&hellip;the multicult madness, the horror it brought, the murder, the rape, the sub-70 IQ mayhem and idiocy. <br>
Female Genital Mutillation. Honor Killings. Ferocious levels of black on white rape and murder. A government that officially, proudly, vocally hates us. White youth who seem to wish they were black ghetto dwellers-even the rich, effete trust fund babies attending cozy marxist colleges. Smoking dope, listening to vile hip hop, driving porsches, and pretending to be poor third worlders. If this is a nightmare, someone please wake me up!<br>
I just want to live my live with blinders on, until I can find a quiet white isolated place. What is there to fight for? Government is a sick farce. We don&rsquo;t even have effective votes anymore.<br>
Really, folks, do any of you think there is anything here left to save? Afterall, a hundred million whites seem to want this!<br>
What can be done to save lunatics like that, or even to live among them, and the foulness they bring (such as these third world heathens?<br>
Tell me!</p>

		<p>Apparently, they didn&rsquo;t want to take the chance that the kids might grow up and &#8220;snitch&#8221; on them&hellip;Same thing happened in Indianapolis, where  2 yr old and 4 yr old children were murdered along with their mothers&hellip;. all over drugs<br>
and still, this behavior is  accepted. <br>
  If there was a disease that killed as many people as blacks do, it would be deemed a &#8220;epidemic&#8221; (remember swine flu?) and  millions would be spent to &#8220;conquer&#8221; it. But we can&rsquo;t even speak about their violent tendencies without being called a racist&hellip;??</p>

		<p>In the book &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion&#8221; in which the rapidity of genetic change in modern eras is discussed, the authors make clear that nature does not respect our feelings; we may be genetically cursed or blessed regardless of our social position, intentions, or politics. In the last paragraph the authors write:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thucydides in the fifth century BC said that human nature<br>
was unchanging and thus predictable, and many scientists today<br>
believe that human nature stopped changing tens of thousands<br>
of years ago. Historians seem to make the same assumption. In<br>
so doing, they&rsquo;re ignoring tremendous opportunities: not just<br>
in decoding the past, but in shaping the future as well. Continuing evolution over human history has been a vast natural experiment, an experiment that promises big payoffs in<br>
understanding, and then fighting, disease and mental illness.<br>
Limone sul Garda hid an important clue about human disease.<br>
With a million villages in the world, there must be many more<br>
such clues. Some of the results of history&rsquo;s experiments may<br>
even aid us in more ambitious efforts aimed at increasing human<br>
life spans and cognitive abilities.<br>
It&rsquo;s time for researchers in the human sciences to shrug off<br>
the chains of dogmas like evolutionary stasis and &ldquo;psychic unity.&rdquo;<br>
There&rsquo;s no time to lose &mdash; and there&rsquo;s a world to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Psychic unity refers I believe to the idea that minds are all alike throughout the world. Clearly there are differences in minds, just as there are differences in bodies. No one wants a return to &#8220;cruelty eugenics&#8221; but rather a just usage of knowledge. That, or perhaps we let the psychopaths rule and &#8220;take care of each other&#8221; as we see here.</p>

Just about says it all. To listen to most Whites (in the media and talk shows) you would think that these moronic Whites have never noticed the unprecedented DEMOGRAPHIC change since the Cellar/Hart Immigration Act was passed. </p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed the absolute silence by these Whites about the horrid, escalating, racial demographics and the anti-White racism and hate crimes that are all directed at Whites and  what it will soon mean to their own children? You would think by listening to Rush, Hannity, O&rsquo;Reilly and the local talk shows that America is still 95% White!!! They seem to have NO problem with nonwhites FLOODING this land as long as they are &#8220;legal&#8221;!!  Are these fools AFRAID to tell the truths or are they really that delusional? </p>

		<p>Anonymous #9, very well said. You echo my sentiments exactly - every one of them. And they&rsquo;re not sentiments I&rsquo;m proud of, and I sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart you and I are both wrong; that some unseen force, circumstance or change of heart miraculously overtakes this country soon. But the maddeningly slow and lackluster opposition by the U.S. population to all you describe is no match for the liberalism and insane economic policies designed to beat our country down to a subservient puppet of a nation. I simply cannot fathom that there are that many more of &#8216;them&rsquo; here than there are &#8216;us&rsquo; - but even worse would be that there are many more of US than THEM and we are so inept, so lazy, so fearful, so docile, that we are allowing them to hijack our country.</p>
<p>These liberal, multi-cult, global agendas have gotten so deeply embedded in this country that at least 2 generations of HOME GROWN Americans have been indoctrinated and are now what one could almost consider &#8216;the enemy.&rsquo; And this isn&rsquo;t even beginning to add in the millions of transplants, both legal and illegal who are mocking the once clear identity of American truths and ideals. There aren&rsquo;t enough Americans left who have lived in what we know as the &#8216;best of times&rsquo; of the U.S. to be able to influence those who have never known such good times here. No one 40 and under has knowledge of that calm, reasonable, trustworthy, safe and patriotic society to be able to compare to today&rsquo;s United States.</p>

		<p>I just returned earlier this week from a business trip to the Silver Spring, MD and Metropolitan D.C. area.  The amount of African immigrants was astonishing even from someone accustomed to a large black population (I live in Chicago). </p>
<p>I observed a lot of aggressive driving by said immigrants, and even observed a 30-something African male seemingly in the middle of a &#8220;getaway&#8221; as he was darting dangerously through traffic, and pulled through a residential neighborhood presumably to &#8220;lose himself&#8221;.  </p>
<p>This made me wonder about who is really responsible for bringing these dangerous criminals and usually non-civilized people to our neighborhoods?</p>

<p>This comment is indicative of what will become a growing tendency among sane people in this country - to flee to another land.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we must realize that what is happening in America is happening throughout the white WORLD.  There is no place to go to.  We need to acknowledge that and act accordingly.</p>

<p>This is from refugee resettlement watch .com:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;The groups that resettle refugees are referred to in the media as &#8216;charities&rsquo; or &#8216;non-profits&rsquo; or &#8216;humanitarian organizations.&rsquo; They are actually federal contractors and get the vast majority of their resources from the U.S. taxpayer. There are now at least 350 non-governmental organizations resettling refugees. They are all dependent on taxpayer funding. Increasingly these groups are made up of refugees&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p> Refugee resettlement organizations (known as Volags from &ldquo;Voluntary Agency&rdquo;) are paid well for their work by the tax payer. There are 10 main Volags with approximately 350 affiliated organizations throughout the country; many are run by former refugees&hellip;The Volags receives $1900 per refugee (including children) from the State Department, half of which they must show went to the refugees&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you good and mad yet?  If not, this should do it:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Refugees, successful asylum seekers, trafficking victim visa holders, &#8216;Cuban-Haitian Entrants&rsquo;  are eligible for ALL federal, state and local welfare programs 30 days after arrival.</p>
<p>Refugee access to welfare on the same basis as a U.S. citizen has made the program a global magnet.</p>
<p>Welfare use is staggering among refugees&hellip;. As some Americans are pushed off of time-limited welfare programs many refugees are going on to life-time cash assistance programs.</p>
<p>Refugees receive waivers for diseases, such as HIV&hellip;. Refugees are a major contributing factor to TB rates among the foreign-born. TB among the foreign-born now accounts for about half of the TB in America&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yzofyfx" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yzofyfx</a></p>
<p>HIV, antibiotic-resistant TB, brain worms, leprosy, chagas, dengue fever  &mdash;  all welcome now to YOUR neighborhood and YOUR health-care facility, paid for by YOU, for life.</p>
<p>Complaints?  You are a racist, hateful, xenophobic KULAK who deserves to be dispossessed of your wealth, heritage, culture and land.</p>
<p>This is your fate.</p>

<p>Why do people like you persist in mis-labeling the &#8220;Hart-Cellar Immigration Act&#8221; as  Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s immigration act?  It was not his! Numerous corrections here over the past don&rsquo;t seem make a dent.  Are you being deliberately deceptive?  I am hardly defending Ted Kennedy, but he was just one of the useful idiots who promoted it.  He did not write it. It was not his baby.</p>
