<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A company executive says a warehouse worker who had been called in to resign opened fire at a beer distributor in Connecticut and at least three people were shot.</p>
<p>A Connecticut official says nine people have died and two were wounded in a shooting at a beer distribution warehouse in Connecticut, Fox News has learned.</p>
<p>Police sources identified the gunman as Omar S. Thornton, whose body was found inside the warehouse where the shooting took place, San Antonio said.</p>
<p>The two wounded individuals were transported the Hartford Hospital are expected to survive, police say.</p>
<p>FOX61 in Hartford is reporting that the shooting may have been racially motivated, and that Thornton reportedly told his girlfriend that he had been discriminated against, and that a supervisor did nothing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thorton was described by John Hollis, a Teamsters Union official, as a recent hire who worked as a driver. Hollis told the Courant that &#8220;the union was bringing him in to meet with the company to remedy&#8221; a &#8220;disciplinary problem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I just saw this story on FOX and details were still coming in. The last report said the gunman killed 8, then turned the gun on himself. No doubt, the leftists will justify this and heroically proclaim the shooter as the victim. Wonder if this will be deemed a hate crime. Nah!<br>

		<p>He was caught stealing company product on videotape. No doubt the racial harassment allegations were just a made up diversion story because he knew he was going to get caught. Guess what the harrassment was? Drawing in the bathroom of - you guessed it - a noose and an epithet. Watch as the reporting goes on and it will never occur to anybody that this guy was a liar as well as a thief and a murderer. And he will be painted the victim when he is the racist killer. His girlfriend is also named Kristi Hannah. Wonder what color she might be? (rhetorical question)</p>

		<p>Fox reported that he was caught on surveillance video stealing beer from his employer.</p>
<p>Black hire steals beer from Jewish boss and gets caught. That&rsquo;s racial harassment and rises to the level of a death sentence for 8 Whites.</p>
<p>Sort of like charges of Racism against any White who used a word that blacks can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Slowly and painfully, White American Humanity is finally waking up.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that Emancipation working out for the yankees in CT?</p>
<p>8 dead, that&rsquo;s how.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s not mentioned in this report, but another I read said that a &#8220;noose&#8221; was found hanging somewhere in the plant recently, and that when Thornton complained to a supervisor, &#8220;nothing was done about it.&#8221; Where have we heard that before? Blacks have been hanging their own nooses and chalking their own &#8220;N-words&#8221; on walls for a long time to try to shift blame to Whites for the blacks&rsquo; own transgressions.</p>
<p> If a surveillance camera caught him stealing beer, and a union official acknowledged the fact to a reporter, you can bet that they had Thornton dead to rights. I&rsquo;ve seen no photos or read any names of the victims yet, but what do you want to bet that every one is White? Yet another paranoid black, convinced that &#8220;The Man&#8221; is eternally out to get him.</p>

		<p>AP copy from the afternoon says that Thornton&rsquo;s g/f&rsquo;s mother says that Thornton claimed to her that he found spray painted nooses and racial slurs on a company wall.  I think Thornton knew he was going to go postal, so he made up a story about nooses and slurs, told it to his g/f&rsquo;s mother, in order for her to blab it to the media upon what he knew would be his death, either at his own hand or the cops, so that the media and libs would have a ready-made excuse to eat up like candy.</p>

		<p>The shooter is black. He was caught on video stealing beer from where he worked. He was called in and told to resign. His girlfriend says he said he was racially harassed. His employer says there have been no racial harassment complaints filed by the black shooter. Of course whenever a black says he has been racially harassed and has been fired for stealing the thing to do is pick up a gun and shoot dead nine white people and wound two other white people. He did commit suicide so that is 1 point in his favor. </p>

		<p>More info:  One of the victims was the President of the Teamster&rsquo;s chapter who defended Thornton at a disciplinary hearing.  The union was fighting like hades for him to keep his job, in spite of his stealing beer, yet he kills the man doing the most to help him.  Also, I understand the company&rsquo;s bosses gave Thornton a whole lot of second chances, as Thornton was sort of a problem employee.</p>
<p>There you go, you do everything for them, you bend over backwards for them, and no good deed goes unpunished.  So it goes with blacks:  The more you do for them, the more they despise you.</p>
<p>This whole thing is reminiscent of the Kirkwood (suburban St. Louis) City Hall shootings from February 2008.  The perp, also named Thornton, (Charles &#8220;Cookie&#8221; Thornton, I&rsquo;m presuming no relation), was another one that was pandered to and groveled to by the psuedo-conservative Kirkwood city government year in and year out, and he goes and bites the hands that fed him.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the media is going to show his picture. I&rsquo;m thinking they will just let this one slide under the radar because black people going on shooting sprees doesn&rsquo;t fit the profile, right? However, maybe this will be a good opportunity to show the country how oppressed blacks are and raise awareness to their plight, because firing a black man who blatantly breaks the rules and steals from the business is racist, right?? </p>

		<p>Another &#8220;black problem&#8221; that (like the IQ gap) won&rsquo;t be discussed is the poisonous combination of entitlement-mindedness and aggrieved/racial outlook on almost everything that anyone who is forced to deal with blacks must try to cope with. </p>
<p>You have to tip-toe around their feelings - and even then, they&rsquo;ll still find some reason to complain. And if you complain, well, then that&rsquo;s obviously &#8220;racist.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Well, OF COURSE shooting 12 or so people is a logical action to take when you&rsquo;re asked to resign your job!  I mean, doesn&rsquo;t everyone do that?  Just check the records of the Post Office employees who got fired!</p>
<p>This is a direct result of schools failing to teach competition in games at schools; the &#8220;everybody&rsquo;s a winner&#8221; mentality does not prepare kids to deal with failure.  When they&rsquo;re faced with it in the real world, they go beserk, since nothing in their previous experience has prepared them for the fact that sometimes you lose!</p>

		<p>&#8220;A whole lot of second chances&#8221;-Question Diversity<br>
I got the chance to do a College paper on work place violence. The one thing that stuck in my mind was this. &#8220;The highest propensity for violence occured with those employees who had been given a second chance&hellip; When the inevitable occurs and the employee is terminated, they view it as a direct abrogation of the second chance agreement  that management had offered and lash out accordingly.&#8221;<br>
 The other thing I remember was to never fire an employee in your own office. If he wont leave you are held hostage in your own workspace. But more importantly, studies show that an employee will &#8220;Imprint&#8221; the site of the humiliation and return there almost instinctivley to enact revenge. Better for you he gets the word at the candy machine.</p>

		<p>We really must investigate the charges of racism at this beer distributor.  To think that a poor disadvantaged Black man with no criminal record could driven to kill his tormentors.  It really begs the question of why in 2010 there is still so much racism.  We really must look to ourselves and see what we can change to bring more diversity to the workplace.</p>
<p> - -  And if you believe that I&rsquo;ll tell you another one.  It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if we hear words akin to that from any one of a number of media talking heads.</p>

You have a super-hero brotha living among the white man, and someone reminded him that we are not gullible white fools, the rules apply to him as well.  So he went from ridin high in whitey-ville with his trophy white girlfriend to being outed as a common thieve.  Oh well.  Anyone learn a lesson here?  Thats why we leave the areas they come into.  Thats why we walk away from them.  This is why we chose not to consort with their kind.  Stick to your own Kind.  </p>

		<p>Omar Thornton filed for bankruptcy protection a decade ago. His Chapter 7 petition in 2000 listed $4,850 in assets, including a 1994 Chrysler Concorde, and more than $15,000 in liabilities  &mdash;  primarily debt on credit card and student loan payments. His debts were discharged in March 2001 and the case was closed the following month.<br>
The Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities said Hartford Distributors has never had any complaints filed against it.</p>
<p>The Union said he never complained to them</p>

		<p>Confirmed.  His girlfriend was white.  Picture of her mom Joanne Hannah.   I have seen so many cases like this.  Black guy living in a white community, belle of the ball everywhere they go.  Anyone objects to their outlandish behaviour or disrespect then they are the wounded over emotional wreck.  Human Rights Commission nor his Union had a complaint filed from him.  His late night crying to his white Girlfriend is the source we are to believe justifies this massacre.And he brought a firearm to the meeting.  So was his thinking &#8220;if they leave me on the job, cool, but it they fire me they all be sorry&#8221;?  When will this Diversity Nightmare end?   <br>

		<p>Whites, come out now and tell the truth about blacks&rsquo; and other minorities&rsquo; behaviors toward you since the Kenyan moved into our beloved White House.</p>
<p>I could fill up AR&rsquo;s pages with story after story about my black supervisor&rsquo;s gross and blatantly racist misbehavior since 2008/2009. </p>
<p>Obama has been nothing but discriminatory toward Whites, and consider his crew and their words and actions: the DOJ and black Eric Holder (getting into more racist mischief than we can presently know), Secretary of Labor Hispanic Hilda Solis (who is working really hard for the &#8220;undocumented&#8221; workers in this country), black Green Jobs Czar Van Jones (who wants to give the country &#8220;back&#8221; to Indians), et al, et al.</p>
<p>It has been my experience in the past two years that people of darker complexion, even the illegal Hispanics, have been boldly stomping on Whites and our superior culture. They keep calling it payback. In reality, it is theft and vandalism.</p>
<p>We recall the post-9/11 call for &#8220;vigilance&#8221;. This hour may be even more urgent. There are many non-Whites in this country who agree with the black panthers&rsquo; king Shabazz&rsquo;s call to kill White babies. Let us not be naive.</p>

<p>Having just looked over several news stories on this mass murder, I can say that this sort of &#8220;reporting&#8221; dominates. </p>
<p>One news outlet is claiming that another news outlet has claimed that the dead mass murderer &#8220;reportedly&#8221; told his girlfriend something? That is not news reporting; that is spreading rumors and gossip. </p>
<p>It gets worse, though, as in &#8220;Family, Friends Of Omar Thornton Say He Never Showed A Violent Side&#8221; from the &#8220;Hartford Courant&#8221; online. Read the article and then ask yourself whether you have ever in your life received the amount of praise publicly that this mass murderer receives here. </p>

		<p>It is a shame how black people think. They hate us. I for one long ago stopped trying to befriend these people, I just don&rsquo;t trust them. I still try and be nice cause thats the way i am but more and more it is evident that beyond their superficiality is resentment and hate. I don&rsquo;t see how there are inter racial relationships. It&rsquo;d be like sleeping with the enemy.<br>
This Conn. rampage is further proof that they can justify pure evil by attempting to turn the tables. This cretin is busted stealing and tells his mom that he killed the racists. Alot of people lost loved ones today. I can&rsquo;t help but feel that a race war is coming to this country. When you have two totally different peoples who clash on many levels, it&rsquo;s inevitable. While the odds are in our favor, white people better get busy. If not, just like in South Africa and Zimbabwe, white people here will become target practice. Looks like we already are.</p>

<p>More and more companies are handing the process to dismiss an employee, especially bigger corporations and non-union employees, by telling the employee to leave the premises, then the company&rsquo;s security will gather the fired employee&rsquo;s belongings from his or her work space/cubicle, then physically bring them to the person, then force them to drive away.</p>

Post #4 foxxxy, asks us: &#8220;How&rsquo;s emancipation working out for you Yankees?&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for dissolutioned 19th century emancipators, but I&rsquo;d dare say that us New England Yankees are in much better shape than southerners when it comes to &#8220;not&#8221; having to &#8220;mix&#8221; nearly as frequently with blacks if we don&rsquo;t want to. </p>
<p>The different racial geographic makeup between north &amp; south accounts for this. You folks got em&rsquo; spread out across all demographics down there and we keep them bottled up in cities for the most part. Never heard of a &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; region up north. That would be an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Blacks currently make up 12-13% of our population. Just think how much less of them there would be if it wasn&rsquo;t for southern insistance on slavery. The north may of had a hand in slavery early on as colonies, but the south gave us the populations we gotta deal with today.</p>
<p>You warned us??? That&rsquo;s real nerve.</p>

THe Philadelphia Eagles are at their training camp and the Comissioner of the NFL or whatever came to the camp to talk to Michael Vick regarding his conduct. I<br>
It seems that at his recent birthday party there was a shooting. Although Vick is not being charged with anything since he was neither the shooter nor the shootee, he was admonished by the Comissioner to watch his behavior. Isn&rsquo;t that freakin&rsquo; pathetic that a grown man who has made millions in his career has to be admonished to behave.  They can&rsquo;t even have a birthday party without a violent episode. <br>
With Blacks and some Hispanics a shooting and /or stabbing seems to be de riguer at social events.</p>

<p>Atlantic City mob boss Nicodemo Scarfo lived in a modest house on Georgia Avenue in the City&rsquo;s &#8220;Ducktown&#8221; section. There was never a mugging on that street although there was a Black neighborhood close by. Those few blocks were some of the safest in the City. No shootings, no muggings, no sexual assaults. A former AC policeman once told me that the cops had less to do in that area because the &#8220;Wise guys&#8221; took care of security.</p>

		<p>As a follow up to my last post, the news reports on the tragic drowning of the teens in Shreveport La. yesterday focused on the fact that none of the people at the gathering knew how to swim. Immediately, it was suggested that it&rsquo;s common among Blacks due to the era of Jim Crow in the South. After all these years the legacy of slavery still prohibits them from learning to swim.<br>
The responsibility is never on them but rather on Whites. Now I guess we&rsquo;ll have a rash of White people being victimized because of the drownings.<br>

<p>The black murderer, a &#8216;flight attendant&rsquo;, had been caught selling those little bottles of liquor on board and pocketing the money.  He was fired and sought revenge  &mdash;   apparently he still had an employee&rsquo;s pass that he used to circumvent the metal detectors and that was how he was able to smuggle a gun on board.</p>

Most are inferring that a White was responsible because &#8220;common wisdom says it&rsquo;s Whites that go postal, not black.&#8221;  This is the same &#8220;wisdom&#8221; that claims serial killers can only be White.</p>
<p>I figured it was a black man with a White girlfriend and that he&rsquo;d been caught and fired for stealing.  He targeted Whites, of course.</p>

		<p>I used to work in health care in a big city that&rsquo;s almost half black.  Naturally, a lot of the employees were black, and  &mdash;  predictably  &mdash;  almost every time one of them was chastised or fired, racial discrimination was claimed.  Of course, at this institution, it was like crying wolf, so no one paid such charges any heed.  Blacks were fired more often than whites, it seemed to me, usually for reasons typical to blacks: sleeping on the job or missing too much work.  </p>

		<p>GNW, with all due respect, no one is more responsible for having brought the African into our midst than first, the British and secondly, New Englanders . Southerners simply accepted the only economic niche that was offered them . Essentially the South was a mercantilist colony first of Britain and then New England after the Revolution . We had barriers up to prevent mixing but they were obliterated by Northern liberals in the fifties and sixties . We tried to stand tall, we were invaded first by the 101st Airborne who moved white students along at bayonet point in Little Rock in &#8216;57 and then by steel helmeted, combat booted, pistol packing, M-79 brandishing, cursing U.S.Marshals who forced their will off on the South at Oxford in &#8216;62 and then went scurrying home to their little defacto white utopias up North . The Northern pastors, priests and nuns who spearheaded the marches in the South were strangely absent in Boston in &#8216;76 . A city which to this day remains one most highly segregated metro areas in the U.S. And even today if the South tries to buck up, you are talking law suits, bussed in protestors, Federal troops and a negative media blitz . We are governed by an entirely different set of Federal rules than you are up North . But I am glad that you, to some degree, are able to hold the line . I wish the South had been able to. But I fear, the dissolution of the Northern enclaves one way or the other, is quickly approaching .   </p>

		<p>Back in the late 70&rsquo;s/early 80&rsquo;s, I worked for a major financial institution in lower Manhattan.  There was one black (gay) supervisor who did a good job and wasn&rsquo;t a complainer.  He pulled his own weight and was plesant to be around.  There were several other blacks in the department who were lazy and incompetent whiners who got away with everything, even stealing.  Even this black supervisor would make subtle complaints about them.  I saw back then, in 1979, that this was our (whites) future because, even at that time, the acknowledgement among whites was they were incompetent and lazy, and they couldn&rsquo;t be fired.  Our demise was well under way 30+ years ago.<br>

<p>When NPR didn&rsquo;t immediately start beating the &#8220;gun violence&#8221; drum after this tragedy, I figured that there had to be a minority racial angle. When caught red-handed, it seems like many black criminals charge &#8220;racism&#8221;. At least, most black criminals don&rsquo;t go on a shooting spree after being caught.

Recently I was called a racist and dyke by a black coworker because I pointed out that I&rsquo;ve noticed a few discrepancies in some bathrooms. I was as tactful, calm, and trying to give her the benefit of the doubt since that particular building at that job site is not usually covered by her.  I agree totally with the posters who have said that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no reasoning with them, and they are too damn prone to violence.  I&rsquo;ve given up on just about all of them. Fortunately and surprisingly, this woman didn&rsquo;t threaten violence.  She knows that I&rsquo;m a former Marine and that she would automatically get fired, but she sure had a major tantrum and then stormed out! Typical petty, childish black behaviour is nothing new to me.</p>

<p> Yes, he killed the five &#8220;racists&#8221;, but what about the other three murdered people? I suppose that they were racists as well, but they hadn&rsquo;t bothered him yet?

		<p>I just want to ad that this incident may have been avoided if the company had acted properly. Had they had the police waiting for him when he got to work and had the thief arrested like they should have this may have been avoided. I understand why companies do this - the fear of a racial discrimination lawsuit and the costs associated with it but they are not doing the community any favors by just letting these losers resign, for all they are doing is dumping these thieves onto the next unsuspecting employer, who will do a background check and find no mention of the stealing. We need to stop lowering our standards when dealing with blacks for this time it cost 8 innocent white folks their lives. He should have been fired and arrested and led out of the building in handcuffs. Attempting to give him a break and just let him resign probably angered him even more, that whites would treat him so civilly.</p>

		<p>Remember when African-Jamaican Colin Ferguson killed six and wounded 19 in 1993 on the Long Island Railroad?  His lawyers proposed a &#8220;black rage&#8221; defense.  He was driven insane by racism and couldn&rsquo;t be responsible for being a mass murderer.</p>

		<p>Peejay - #26: I remember that plane crash. The black guy got on the flight that his former boss [ that had fired him ] was on. Once airborne, he handed his former boss a note that said: &#8220;Hi Ray. I think it&rsquo;s sort of ironical that we ended up like this. I asked for some leniency for my family. Remember? Well, I got none and you&rsquo;ll get none.&#8221; He then went and shot the pilots there by causing it to crash. He killed something like 40 innocent people just to get revenge on his boss. </p>

		<p>I heard on the radio today that they&rsquo;re saying &#8220;he had a White girlfriend, so he COULD&rsquo;NT be racist&#8221;. <br>
I&rsquo;ve got news for you - some of the worst black racists have White girlfriends! I know, go figure!</p>

		<p>Not that I believe he was a victim of any racism but him murdering so many of another race for any reason related to race&hellip; now how is that by the ridiculous definition not a hate crime? And if it is not how can anyone say if any crime is a &#8220;hate&#8221; crime?</p>
<p>He had plenty of hate. hate for whites, any that were around when his bullets flew.</p>

		<p><i>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how &ldquo;racism&rdquo; seems to be the worst crime in the world to some liberals? </i></p>
<p>The Liberals who are in the forefront of the environmentalist movement dream that someone somehow will come up with a simple solution to global warming, et al.  However, I am sure that if an &#8220;infamous racist&#8221; - someone like Jared Taylor - were to be the one to discover that solution, the liberals would rather let the planet burn than allow such a &#8220;racist&#8221; to be given any positive publicity whatsoever.  </p>

		<p>On the other hand you look up &ldquo;Kristi Hannah&rdquo; on myspace, (the more ghetto version of facebook!) you find this person http://www.myspace.com/allmeandmore  comes up, with the location given of &ldquo;enfield&rdquo; which is where the AP reported the family lives.</p>
<p>Of course she is blond, and actually surprisingly attractive. Probably could have gotten herself a Yale boyfriend if she had set her sights a little higher.<br>

<p>I put up the myspace link and I do not think she is very pretty at all. As for getting a Yale boyfriend, I highly doubt it..</p>
<p>This is a youtube video of her mother who claims Thornton was a good mellow guy and she is the one who says he was harrassed by Whitey. I have seen too many of her type and they all have that same look about them. She sure did not raise her daughter right to allow her to date a black to begin with. Typical anti-white White person.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of my Army days. I had a soldier   &mdash;   a black, female African refugee   &mdash;   who tried to file I-don&rsquo;t-know-how-many charges of racism and discrimination against me at company-, battalion-, and brigade-level &#8220;EO&#8221; offices, Commanders, Inspector Generals, etc., endlessly. She seemed to feel I should give her no orders. She also bitterly resented my normal dealings with another soldier who happened to be an attractive, white woman. While I was investigated, re-investigated, and then investigated some more, this black woman physically threatened the white woman, but got away with it. </p>
<p>The other soldiers ALL signed statements that the claims were absurd, and she was told to stop making frivolous, reckless charges, but she kept right at it. She kept trying to rope another minority soldier into her campaign against me, but he sided with me too. Her allegations were ALL thrown out, and there were hints that she&rsquo;d acted the same at a previous unit, but &#8220;EO&#8221; rules prevented that from being held against her in any way. Finding time for all these investigations came on top of my other duties. </p>
<p>I tried to just get rid of her on grounds that that was best for us both, but no one would take her. When we deployed, she was given a clerical job, far from me. Finally, I heard she was charged with brandishing her weapon against another American soldier, and sent home.<br>

		<p>I, like so many others, am sick and tired of the sociopaths and pychos who use the excuse of racism (or cultural differences) to justify their cowardly and/or criminal behavior. And for that matter, the extremely bias media who perpetuate this myth. That is, if the one commiting the act is not white.</p>
