<h1>White Nationalists Following Wake School Diversity Fight</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Keung Hui, News and Observer (Raleigh), August 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Socialists, Communists and anarchists aren&rsquo;t the only ones who are closely following the Wake County school diversity fight.</p>
<p>The white nationalists have also been monitoring the student assignment fight. American Renaissance, called a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, regularly carries excerpts of news stories about the ongoing situation in Wake.</p>
<p>In the latest example, American Renaissance carried the N&O; story about AdvancED&rsquo;s accreditation review of the Wake school system. Most of the reader comments about the review and African Americans were harsh, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>The political extremes on both the left and right have gravitated toward the diversity issue. For instance, far-left groups such as Raleigh F.I.S.T. and The People&rsquo;s World have frequently covered and spoken out about the end of the diversity policy in Wake.</p>
<p>Things got nasty last fall when some people tried to impugn the candidates who opposed the diversity policy by noting how American Renaissance was covering the campaign. They were urging the newspaper to report on it but it didn&rsquo;t pass muster for coverage.<br>

		<p>Note the reporter&rsquo;s name, Keung Hui.  It would appear that this person is not a white American.  </p>
<p>The fact is, however, that this is good publicity.  There will be people looking at this site that have never before considered it!</p>
<p>Those who are close minded will remain so.  Those who are open-minded will get a rational viewpoint, and some will begin to pick away at the layers of lies we are fed.</p>

 - - The Southern Poverty Law Center.  There&rsquo;s nothing &#8220;Southern&#8221; about the Southern Poverty Law Center.  And there&rsquo;s also nothing about &#8220;poverty&#8221; in this trashy organization.  They specialize in demonizing Whites - any Whites - with a milligram of race consciousness in them, and lauding any non-Whites who have many times more race consciousness in them.  Their reputation is well-known among Amren posters and any White with any race consciousness at all.</p>

<p>Well, then, if the SPLC <i>says</i> AmRen is a &#8220;Hate Group,&#8221; then it must <i>be</i> a Hate Group, right?  I mean, the SPLC is a perfectly honest, open, neutral source of reliably factual information, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Is there some kind of federal law that requires all liberal reporters (or do I repeat myself?) to run to the latest SPLC press release before writing any story on White racial awareness?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In the latest example, American Renaissance carried the N&O; story about AdvancED&rsquo;s accreditation review of the Wake school system. Most of the reader comments about the review and African Americans were harsh, to put it mildly.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;ll notice that &#8220;Keung Hui&#8221; (not exactly a good-ole Carolina boy&rsquo;s name, is it?) doesn&rsquo;t bother actually <i>quoting</i> any of those reader comments, so his readers could judge for themselves.  And he <i>certainly</i> doesn&rsquo;t provide a link to the AmRen website.  He wants the average <i>Observer</i> reader to imagine a miasma of seething Hate, punctuated by crude threats and dangling nooses, with a sweaty, drunken mob muttering behind their computer screens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible not to notice that the &#8220;far-left&#8221; groups named in the article don&rsquo;t get nearly the amount of horrified attention as AmRen, oddly enough.</p>

		<p>During the days when anti-desegregation candidates ran for and won spots on the St. Louis City School Board, those candidates consistently got 80-85% of the white votes.  That&rsquo;s supposed to be a really extremist position, that the Raleigh Nuisance and Obstructer equates with hard core Lenin-wing extremists.</p>

		<p>So, the diversitoids want the press to associate opposition to busing with groups such as American Renaissance. In the recent review of the collected papers of William Shockley, reviewed by Thomas Jackson, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that Jackson seemed to be wondering if Shockley was being purposefully provocative. Perhaps to the point of embarrassing the positions he was pretending to espouse, to make the devil real, perhaps. He doesn&rsquo;t reveal his opinion on this in the review. I&rsquo;d be curious to know Thomas Jackson&rsquo;s true opinion on this. When there are no standards, it becomes a dangerous world of monkey-see monkey do. Regular people begin to take up these provocative postures from the anonymity behind their pen and they take on the status of status quo. Satire is one thing but when everything becomes satire or every position must met with it&rsquo;s dialectic opposite&hellip;</p>

Great news. American Renaissance will get a sizable boost in circulation.</p>
<p>As AR has so often said, if diversity is as wonderful as we&rsquo;re told, people would seek it out and not have it forced on them.</p>
<p>Diversity is not a strength. It&rsquo;s an endless source of conflict and outright violence.<br>

		<p>Interesting to read the original article and comments. I grew up in Wake County, and personally experienced the appalling breakdown of scholarship, security and conduct as my old and reputable high school was &#8220;desegregated&#8221;.</p>
<p>My hat is off to Asian-&#8220;American&#8221; reporter T. Keung Hui. For once, an Establishment &#8220;journalist&#8221; actually live-links to AmRen! and the N&O; readers actually can look and see for themselves! Heavens! I bet he never does <i>that</i> again. (After all, <i>decent</i> people can&rsquo;t be giving any credence to what one do-gooder commentator there called &#8220;white supremecists&#8221; [sic]!)</p>
<p>At the same time, it&rsquo;s always encouraging to see signs of Justice with a Capital &#8220;J&#8221;  &mdash;  I strongly suspect that some of those New Jersey carpetbaggers are put out exactly because they&rsquo;re having to face now what they ran away from up north. Tragic, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>I have read a little bit about the USA &#8220;Bussing&#8221; system over the years. I understand the idea is to bus kids from decent white neighbourhoods to poor schools in the misguided hope that good teachers, dedicated parents and money will follow. I find it hard to believe that such an outrageous scheme could ever be devised.</p>
<p>I see why so many Americans home school their children or send them to a private school if funds permit.</p>
<p>It is totally unfair to call those who oppose this pointless forced intergration dreadful names like racist ( meaningless term) Nazi or bigot etc. I am sure you are just VERY concerned Americans, nothing more nothing less. Amren is to be commended in all of these things, unfortunately I feel the opposition is now reaching &#8220;critical mass&#8221;</p>
<p>PS.If a property which is for sale here happens to be near a good school this will be promoted as a selling feature and parents who buy that house know their children will go to the scool of their parent&rsquo;s choice. Very simple and quite fair!</p>

		<p>So stating facts is racist?  Notice that this piece does not even begin to refute anything posted on Amren?  They just scream &#8220;hate group&#8221; and present it as a sufficient rebuttal!  Talk about intellectual laziness.  Or I should say, intellectual non-existence!</p>
<p>Oh, and last time I checked, the SPLC was an anti-White hate group:</p>
<p>https://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=721</p>
<p>&#8220;From the beginning, white Americans have brutalized American Indians. Half a millennium later, the hate goes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Excuse me?  So &#8220;white Americans have brutalized American Indians&#8221;?  ALL White Americans&#8221;?  Notice the SPLC has NO PROBLEMS blaming all White people for crimes committed hundreds of years ago by less than 3% of the White population at THAT TIME, none of whom are alive now.</p>
<p>How about if I say that &#8220;Black Americans brutalized White females&#8221; and posted the Department of Justice Black-on-White stats, a crime which is happening TODAY, not over 500 years ago?  Could I post that?  Why no, of course not, that would be racist.</p>
<p>The only hate group is the SPLC.</p>

		<p>Give it another 30 years at the most and white voters are likely to impliment a &#8216;busing&rsquo; program of their own. I bet the few bleeding hearts left call it &#8216;forced busing&rsquo;. It may take awhile, but they get around to using accurate terms. </p>

		<p>9:  In theory, busing for deseg was supposed to work both ways:  Bus whites into black areas and blacks into white areas.  The practical result has been far more the latter than the former, and the theory was purely environmental.  And it&rsquo;s been a big expensive flop.</p>
<p>Missouri&rsquo;s deseg costs to the state budget have been the worst of all, relative to the entire state budget and the relative wealth of the state.  Don&rsquo;t forget, the state had to foot the bill for two different urban district boondoggles, that infamous Kansas City thing of the olympic swimming pool fame, and the inter-district scheme in St. Louis.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love how socialists and non-whites immediately call us haters and bigots and badmouth us without letting people make up their own minds about us?  Most, normal-thinking whites don&rsquo;t agree with diversity.  Most of us prefer not to be in black or hispanic neighborhoods.  Most of us prefer that our young marry and have children with eachother instead of sleeping with non-whites.  It&rsquo;s natural and if we&rsquo;re bigots for thinking this, then I guess so are the majority of whites.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to know when america&rsquo;s media centers scour the world wide globe in search of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; for their newsrooms (because so few non-whites raised here can do the job) occasionally they hire a non-white who can adequately represent conservative whites they are displacing. This isn&rsquo;t a bad article at all, except for the part about how the comments to AmRen are despicable. Also, as long as the non-white population is considerable younger than the white population, human resource departments will continue to go overseas when they want to fulfill the requirement to find employees that &#8216;look more like the rest of America&rsquo;. And as long as our school systems remain the way they are, most of the non-white faces hired by the newspapers will be faces originally appearing overseas too. </p>

<p>What you are ignoring is that the rest of the white population largely did not condemn these crimes, nor did subsequent generations of the white population consider it a shameful episode in history. It was for a long time considered &#8216;Manifest Destiny&rsquo; for whites to massacre Native Americans and take more and more of their territory for white benefit, and those who did such things were portrayed as heroic. By condoning the crime, one self-identifies with the crime, therefore the generalization of the SPLC is acceptable. Individual white Americans of today who wish to drop this burden of the past should simply cease self-identifying as &#8216;white&rsquo;, and just be American.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about if I say that &ldquo;Black Americans brutalized White females&rdquo; and posted the Department of Justice Black-on-White stats, a crime which is happening TODAY, not over 500 years ago? Could I post that? Why no, of course not, that would be racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, the rest of the black population strongly condemns black crime, and consider black criminals a source of shame upon their community. Therefore black criminals do not reflect upon blacks as a whole, just as male criminals do not reflect upon men as a whole. Therefore you would indeed be racist to charge blacks as a whole for the actions of black criminals, just as you would be sexist if you were to charge men as a whole for the actions of male criminals. </p>

If he did, he&rsquo;d come scurrying over here and sign up as a &ldquo;white nationalist&rdquo; himself, even though he&rsquo;s of East Asian ancestry.</i></p>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t know - he did just send tons of his readers &#8220;scurrying&#8221; over here to read this website.  </p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Hui&rsquo;s kids have been beaten by blacks a few too many times for his taste.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a mainstream journalist prove a live link to a White race-realist website before.  He also said our comments were &#8220;harsh&#8221; (rather than &#8220;hateful&#8221; or &#8220;deranged&#8221;), and called us &#8220;nationalists&#8221; instead of &#8220;supremacists&#8221;.  I think that would make race-realism-curious whites more likely to visit Amren.  </p>
<p>Either way, thank you Mr. Hui!  </p>

<p>I agree. I don&rsquo;t see what was so bad about this article. Considering the man is a minority himself, it must have taken him a lot of integrity to write a fairly un-biased article about such an inflammatory subject.</p>

<p><b>What you are ignoring is that the rest of the white population largely did not condemn these crimes, nor did subsequent generations of the white population consider it a shameful episode in history. It was for a long time considered �?Manifest Destiny&rsquo; for whites to massacre Native Americans and take more and more of their territory for white benefit, and those who did such things were portrayed as heroic. By condoning the crime, one self-identifies with the crime, therefore the generalization of the SPLC is acceptable. Individual white Americans of today who wish to drop this burden of the past should simply cease self-identifying as �?white&rsquo;, and just be American.</b></p>
<p>Then blacks and other non-whites could call themselves Americans and quite identifying themselves as &#8220;African-American&#8221; or whatever.  They could quit accusing the very people who kiss their butts and bendover backwards all the time as &#8216;racists&rsquo;  Besides, how do you know most whites condoned all these acts?  Where&rsquo;s your proof?  How do you know most of them didn&rsquo;t secretly abhor it?  I&rsquo;m sure the blacks that were lynched in those days  &mdash;  and whites weren&rsquo;t constantly going around and killing them for no reason  &mdash;  were rapists, murderers, and thieves.  People had no tolerance for criminals back then, regardless of their race.</p>
<p><b>In contrast, the rest of the black population strongly condemns black crime, and consider black criminals a source of shame upon their community. Therefore black criminals do not reflect upon blacks as a whole, just as male criminals do not reflect upon men as a whole. Therefore you would indeed be racist to charge blacks as a whole for the actions of black criminals, just as you would be sexist if you were to charge men as a whole for the actions of male criminals. </b></p>
<p>Wait.  You say it&rsquo;s racist to charge blacks as a whole, yet you don&rsquo;t have a problem charging whites as a whole.  I guess you just got out of a Multicultural Diversity class, huh?  Also, spare us the lecture of how most blacks condemn black criminals.  Do they speak out as a race against black race hustlers?  Do they speak out as a race against blacks who attack whites?  <br>
