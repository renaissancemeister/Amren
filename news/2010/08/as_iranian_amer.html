			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Faturechi, Los Angeles Times, August&nbsp;22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Iranian culture is by no means alone in making huge affairs out of weddings, rites of passage and other celebrations. But rarely are the stakes as high as they are for Iranian Americans, particularly in Los Angeles, home to the largest  &mdash;  and one of the most affluent  &mdash;  Persian communities outside of Iran.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, the initial years of the Iranian diaspora, many were unsure whether L.A. would be any more than a temporary home, and were wary of spending extravagantly during a time of transition. But as members of the immigrant group began to settle down and prosper, there was a shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said &#8216;If we are living in this country, let&rsquo;s live,&rsquo;&#8221; Shabpareh said. &#8220;It used to be only one cameraman with the camera on his shoulder. Now there are four or five camera crews at parties and they have a 25-foot crane over the dance floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The festivities often double as enormous family reunions, with relatives flying in from the East Coast and abroad. Open bars, fully stocked with top-shelf liquors, are the norm. Guests dance to live musicians so well-known in the community that many go by one name. Festivities continue into the early morning, fueled by cups of black tea and sugary Persian pastries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheila Kharrazi, 32, of Beverly Hills would have preferred a smaller ceremony, maybe even a destination wedding at some far-flung locale. But with Persian weddings, she said, the bride and groom don&rsquo;t always get to choose.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Persian community, your wedding is not so much your wedding as it is your parents&rsquo; wedding,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My mom&rsquo;s response was &#8216;Your kid&rsquo;s wedding will be your wedding.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mother&rsquo;s desire to have a large affair trumped the wishes of the bride and groom. Kharrazi and her husband, an orthopedic surgeon, ended up getting married at the Beverly Hills Hotel with some 450 guests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sepehr Jourabchi, 40, a textiles wholesaler, began saving  &mdash;  for his wedding and other big expenses  &mdash;  long before he&rsquo;d even met his wife, Mehrnoush Salim, 30. When the Beverly Hills couple decided to marry, he said he was prepared for the hefty price tag.</p>
<p>Some 400 guests attended their wedding, featuring a live band, a sushi station before dinner and an elaborate series of giant trees composed of white orchids, roses and hydrangeas. Crystals and candles hung from the branches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bad economy has challenged the culture of the lavish Persian wedding, forcing some hosts to cut back, at least a little.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, many in the Persian community are loath to leave out even the most distant of relatives  &mdash;  a reality Akhtarzad says is on full display at mixed-ethnicity wedding receptions, where the vast majority of guests will be from the Persian side of the family.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought that Iranians and Italians are similar in many respects. Italian weddings also rarely have less than 100 guests and Italian newlyweds often don&rsquo;t really get to choose venue and guests either.  </p>
<p>While not white or Christian, the Iranians I&rsquo;ve met have been well-educated and urbane. If only rich Iranians were the worst of the U.S.&rsquo;s immigration problems.</p>

		<p>The Persian community in Los Angeles is indeed the wealthiest in the world. It is Jewish, and took a great deal of Iran&rsquo;s wealth with it when it left during the revolution.</p>

		<p>These expatriates [most by now are American born and have never been to Iran?] are keeping the traditions of the old country alive and well in a manner that it is impossible in Iran. The mullahs are stick-in-the-dirt that frown upon such lavish displays of wealth. And why do these Iranians seem to prosper so well?  Far better off than your average-everyday American.</p>

		<p>Beverly Hills is awash in rich Iranians, but they are mostly Jewish rather than Persian. My sister&rsquo;s old neighborhood there was loaded with them, and Iranian Jews also bought her house when she and her husband moved to the East Coast. I used to spend a lot of time in the Beverly Hills library, and I always wondered why there were so many Middle Eastern-looking teenagers hanging out there, too  &mdash;   until I learned that they were the children of Iranian Jews who had taken the money and run once the Islamic Revolution took place in Iran in 1979.</p>

		<p>This story is really a non-issue (or rather it should be) for AmRen.  As a lifetime resident of Zoo York City, I&rsquo;ve been to more than my fair share of ostentatious Irish, Italian and Jewish weddings.  Conspicuous consumption (especially during weddings) is so ubiquitous among humans it appears to be innate.</p>

Something to consider: by holding these lavish affairs these people are pumping large sums of money into the local economy.  A lot of that money will eventually wind up in the hands of White people.</p>
<p>Finally, and more importantly: rather than asking why Iranians hold such lavish spectacles is why are there Iranians in this country in the first place?</p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s not only Persians who are having ostentatious and expensive weddings. Other Americans are also pressing the financial limits on weddings. During the worst recession since the 1930s, Chelsea Clinton has a three million dollar wedding in Upstate New York.  She spent a half million dollars on flowers alone! With so many marriages ending in divorce, Some American women seem to be demanding more elaborate public marriage ceremonies. Perhaps, there is a bit of &#8220;magical thinking&#8221; here  &mdash;  the more spectacle, publicity and notoriety you create at the wedding, the less chance of divorce? I know two couples who had the choice of simple weddings with substantial monetary gifts or elaborate weddings without the gifts. In each case the brides picked the big, expensive weddings. </p>

		<p>My wedding was at a courthouse.  We had a small party for about a dozen family and friends that weekend, for which we did almost all the cooking ourselves, except for some items we bought at the supermarket deli.  Booze was mostly homebrewed cider, though I had picked up some mexed imports for those who preferred beer.</p>
<p>We requested no gifts.  I had already paid off the mortgage, so we didn&rsquo;t need cash, and of course at the age of 40, I already had the usual kitchen full of small appliances that tend to comprise typical wedding gifts.</p>
<p>I knew an Italian couple who had a massive, ultra-expensive Church wedding in Chicago, paid for by her parents.  The marriage ended in divorce after about two years, because she was having an affair. (Less than two years? That was fast.)  An expensive wedding guarantees only that someone is out a whole lot of money.  Her parents, as one might expect, were as completely unamused by her infidelity as her husband.</p>

		<p>Like Cuba, Like Vietnam, Like Iran, Like Venezuela,<br>
Like El Salvador..when your country is taken over<br>
by Communists, or Mullahs, or despots..and you refuse <br>
to fight for it, or you fight half heartedly and <br>
you LOSE YOUR COUNTRY&hellip;then YOU LIVE IN IT.<br>
You dont fly off to Los Angeles or boat to Miami<br>
you live in your country and face the consequences..not mine.<br>
I am sure when white Americans lose this fight against<br>
the Third World and race replacement it will be the absolute<br>
end of us. Because we have no place to go. I only wish everyone<br>
understood that</p>
