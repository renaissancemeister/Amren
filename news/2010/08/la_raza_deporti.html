<h1>La Raza: Deporting 12 Million Illegal Aliens &#8216;Not a Realistic Solution&rsquo; and U.S. Should Stop Trying</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Cassandra, Cybercast News Service, August 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United States cannot deport all 12 million illegal aliens in the United States and should stop trying, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) told CNSNews.com last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Deporting 12 million people is not a realistic solution,&#8221; she [NCLR Immigration Field Coordinator A. Elena Lacayo] wrote [in response to a question from CNS]. &#8220;It&rsquo;s time we create a rational immigration system, take these people out of the shadows and restore the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNSNews.com had asked Lacayo: &#8220;Should law enforcement officers strive to prosecute and deport known illegal immigrants whenever they are apprehended or stopped for any reason since they are breaking U.S. law by being inside U.S. borders without legal documentation?&#8221;</p>
<p>La Raza released a report last week calling for the termination of a federal program that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to work with local law enforcement to target illegal aliens for deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report said that a majority of immigrants detained under 287(g) authority, &#8220;have been apprehended for minor offenses such as driving with a broken taillight, fishing without a permit, or &#8216;conspiracy to smuggle oneself,&rsquo;&#8221; referring to instances when illegal immigrants conspire with human smugglers to enter the United States.</p>
<p>The NCLR also directly attacked Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz. Sheriff Arpaio is internationally known for his strict enforcement of immigration laws in Arizona.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps no jurisdiction has shown greater misuse of the 287(g) program than Maricopa County, where Sheriff Joe Arpaio has effectively converted the police department into an immigration enforcement agency,&#8221; the report stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 2,200 lawsuits have been filed against Sheriff Arpaio&rsquo;s broad use of the 287(g) program for &#8216;crime suppression/anti-illegal immigration&rsquo; sweeps that have been conducted &#8216;without any evidence of criminal activity violating federal regulations intended to prevent racial profiling,&rsquo;&#8221; stated the report.</p>
<p>Arpaio did not respond to attempts by CNSNews.com to seek his response to the allegations. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to ICE, since January of 2006, the 287(g) program is credited with identifying more than 173,000 potentially removable aliens, mostly at local jails.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, told CNSNews.com that the criticism of the 287(g) program for apprehending illegal aliens for minor violations has become very common but is &#8220;silly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every person who is an illegal alien here is potentially subject to deportation because they are in violation of immigration law and they don&rsquo;t have permission to be here,&#8221; Vaughan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the way they get discovered is because they commit another crime, I think most Americans understand the logic there that that&rsquo;s simply how they came into the attention of law enforcement,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What it boils down to is that this organization, National Council of La Raza, (apparently does not) think any illegal alien should be subject to immigration law enforcement,&#8221; Vaughan told CNSNews.com.</p>

		<p>Deporting all 12 million, or whatever the correct number is, is  not practical, but lets leave open the possibility of ANY of them being deported if they commit a serious crime.The La Razists want to eliminate the possibility  of ANY them being deported. </p>

		<p>I agree that &ldquo;Deporting 12 million people is not a realistic solution&rdquo;.  However, what IS a realistic solution is for the feds, states, and local governments throughout the USA, to shut off all the freebies these invaders get when they come here.  If they don&rsquo;t get the handouts they will &#8220;deport&#8221; themselves.  Proof of this is in how so many illegals have bailed out of Arizona, in fear of SB1070, even before it went into effect, and even before the traitor federal judge stopped much of it from going into effect. BTW, it is WAY more than 12 million.  Don&rsquo;t set out the bait, then they won&rsquo;t come here. </p>

<p>There are several examples from history of governments deporting millions of people. Mass deportation is always called unrealistic by illegal immigration advocates. The problem is one of will not fesability.</p>

<p>Mass deportation is quite feasible.  The costs of thousands of Greyhound bus trips and/or train tickets is a TINY FRACTION of the future costs of welfare, food stamps, public education, crime, violence, and social decay.  The cost/benefit analysis is stratospherically in favor of MASS DEPORTATION.</p>
<p>The logistics are quite possible.  America mobilized tens of millions of people during times of world war.  Chucking out 20 million Mexicans will be no problem, especially if most self-deport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite easy:<br>
-bounty rewards for turning in illegal aliens ($50 per snag)<br>
-massive penalties for employing illegal aliens ($20,000 fine per employee)<br>
-a 90 day grace period for businesses to clean their rosters of illegal aliens (to give businesses a chance to avoid excessive fines)<br>
-a few thousand troops on the Southern border<br>
-military live-fire training on said border<br>
-authorization for use of force to defend said border</p>
<p>Folks, common-sense solutions are exactly the options that have been purposefully ignored and reviled.  America could be a stronger nation in less than two years by using the above-listed solutions.</p>
<p>DEMAND that your politicians DEPORT ALL ILLEGAL ALIENS.  Using Mexicans as a political bargaining chip for votes and social strife is TREASON.  </p>

		<p>Though many might want to, no one is realistically suggesting that we try to load all the illegals into tandem trucks and dump them south of the border.  But, of course, La Raza et.al. will accuse us of the most preposterous plans imaginable.  I&rsquo;m surprised they haven&rsquo;t accused the Tea Party people and other conservatives of fomenting secret plans to mow them all down with Gatling guns!  <br>
The feds, at least at times, seem to treat illegals as if they are beyond the reach of American laws.  One TV Cops show followed El Paso police as they pulled a sting on hookers.  They picked up one Mexican male and  &mdash;  as they were obliged to do  &mdash;  handed him over to the border patrol.  Within one hour, they picked him up again!  I told my husband that American prostitutes should tell these cops that they&rsquo;re illegals and thus beat the rap!</p>

<p>As for &#8220;living in the shadows&#8221;, what hogwash is that? They are in plain sight and dare us to say anything. </p>
<p>I do not want the kind of &#8220;rational&#8221; immigration reform that this idiot is promoting.</p>
<p>The way to deport all of them and their children is to go back to the original intent of the 14th amendment (which never even suggested that illegals and their anchor babies become citizens!) and stop all education, welfare, jobs, medical care, housing and these people would all be more than happy to return to their native lands! Our own government ENABLES these people to keep coming and to stay. SEAL that border by any means necessary like we should have done 50 years ago! </p>

		<p>&#8220;Rational&#8221; is just her code for saying take no action to enforce our laws, let the illegals come in their millions. Dumping tens of millions of people illegally on us is a hostile act by the country of Mexico. Oh, and the old number of 12 million is way out of date and way too low, just another way of trying to bamboozle the public. The most rational thing would be to take a hard line and do what it takes to assert ourselves now rather than later when it would be even harder. They are doing what&rsquo;s good for them; we must be rational and do what&rsquo;s best for us.</p>

I get a feeling from this piece that La Raza is getting worried. They must see opinions shifting. Americans are no longer looking at illegal aliens as victims anymore. They have overplayed their hand.</p>
<p>With all the civil and implied &#8216;human&rsquo; rights initiatives, deportation does seem difficult. However, simply enforcing existing laws would result in a large percentage of self-deportees. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how to realistically deport 20 million illegal immigrants:  Mandate the use of e-verify and impose a $2000 per illegal per day fine on employers who employ illegal aliens.  Make it a cause for instant, irrevocable firing of any government employee who aids an illegal alien in obtaining taxpayer funded services, such as food stamps, AFDC, housing subsidies, Medicaid, etc.  Carefully audit such programs to make sure that only citizens are receiving their services.</p>
<p>With no jobs and no dole 20 million illegals will walk back home the same way they got here in the first place.  And I say 20 million, not 12 million.  The press settled on the magic 12 million number at least 10 years ago.  Are we to seriously believe that not a single person has immigrated illegally since?</p>
<p>As for illegals &#8220;hiding in the shadows&#8221;, we can only wish they did.  Instead they are everywhere, blasting loud mariachi music out of their SUVs, wearing their Atzlan T-shirts, throwing trash on my local streets, and marching on Washington demanding citizenship in return for having broken our laws.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Deporting 12 million people is not a realistic solution,&rdquo; - Sure it is, particularly when we consider the non-deportation &#8220;solution&#8221;: We&rsquo;ll have continued levels of higher crime, more welfare, the higher cost of multilingualism, more social-disjointedness, etc., leading to greater ethnic hatred, civil conflict and the probable breakup of the nation. But of course, THAT is exactly what the anti-American LaRaza forces have in mind. Unfortunately for America, the fact that we are even arguing this issue shows that the LaRaza forces have pretty much already won.</p>

		<p>It <i>is</i> realistic.</p>
<p>Assuming a $5,000 of total deportation cost per person (which seems like a gross overestimate), it would amount to $100 billion, or some 15 percent of the stimulus money, a lion share of which went to foreign banks, private estates, labor unions, and waste, and did little to &#8220;stimulate&#8221; the economy.</p>
<p>So, if the feds can afford throwing trillion here and trillion there then, please, don&rsquo;t tell me that they can&rsquo;t spare lousy hundred billion to rid America with huge liability (illegal aliens and their countless kids).</p>
<p>Besides, if the illegals can send some $20 billion a year in remittances to Mexico then they also can afford to pay for some of their deportation costs as a restitution to the country whose border and laws they did violate.<br>

		<p>  Before amnesty, we should count them all.  If there really are 20 to 30 million here, the deal&rsquo;s off. We just can&rsquo;t afford them.</p>
<p>Look for any calls to count the illegals before amnesty to be shouted down as a &#8220;racist, hate monger ploy to appeal to the worst prejudices of whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never &#8220;White community.&#8221;  Whites are NEVER allowed to think of themselves as  a community with common interests with other Whites.</p>
<p><br>
What about the pregnant Mexican who is &#8220;struggling&#8221; to get inside our border before her Mexican baby drops (father unknown) just before she crosses the border.   </p>
<p>What if she then carries baby across border and registers it as a Citizen anyway?  Who&rsquo;s to say she didn&rsquo;t have it on our side?</p>
<p>What about when she drops the baby in Mexico City when she was on her way to our border?  Should we give baby our U.S. Citizenship just because she wanted to cross our border, but we made the &#8220;struggle&#8221; to difficult a hurdle because our draconian and outdated border laws.   Shouldn&rsquo;t we take the blame and just award Citizenship on her Mexican based upon her &#8220;intent&#8221; to drop the baby in America?</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s coming next. You can feel it. America is marching toward its inevitable Day of Racial Reckoning, long overdue, but thankfully, predictable.</p>
<p>Middle Class Anglo-Saxon-Germanic-Celtic-Italians will only stay docile for so long while their sworn enemies steal everything.</p>
<p>Enough of us are refusing to &#8220;atone for the sins of slavery, imperialism, segregation, racism, classism, and sexism.&#8221; </p>
<p>We are regaining our health and natural status within God&rsquo;s order.<br>

		<p>Count me among those who believe the deportation-solution to be not only feasible, but necessary! Those who say it can&rsquo;t be done fall into three main categories:</p>
<p>1) Those simply don&rsquo;t WANT it to be done.</p>
<p>2) Those who have never really considered or cannot comprehend the fairly simple logistics it.</p>
<p>3) Those who are too emotionally soft to do what is right.</p>
<p>As others have noted - enforce the laws, go after the facilitators, hold the enablers criminally liable, etc., and more than half the problem will solve itself. The rest can most certainly be done and done well. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Attrition by enforcement&#8221; is a means to encourage illegal aliens to self-deport. Here&rsquo;s the program:</p>
<p>*Secure the borders, </p>
<p>*Apply serious worksite enforcement [mandate E-Verify], </p>
<p>*Eliminate document fraud,</p>
<p>*Reform unwitting accomplices: the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service (both of which agencies know of millions using duplicate or phoney SS numbers),</p>
<p>*Encourage state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws,</p>

Every ten years, we could do a &#8216;proof of residency&rsquo; census.</p>
<p>Anyone caught without proof of US citizenship, would be made to leave to the country of their choosing. If they didn&rsquo;t, they could be jailed until they decided they wanted to leave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure every 10 years, just before the residency census, we would see a rise in self-deportations.</p>

		<p>Deportation of 20 or even 30 million Mexican illegals is not only feasible, it must be done. Shut off all the jobs, freebies at whites&rsquo; expense, welfare and anchor baby citizenship for their children and many will start to run back to Mexico. Start punishing anyone who employs or aids and abets their activities here. Then start a reign of terror against the gangs and the others who stay anyway. Start executing the ones on the spot who are gang members, or committed violence against Americans. Make life unbearable for these unwanted and unwashed invaders, and relatively few would have to be herded at gunpoint into railway cattle cars or trucks for forced repatriation back to Mexico. We must do this, because the alternative is to hunt down and kill them, or vice versa. They mean what they say in that they want to kill or drive us out of our own land, so the choices are to kick them out, or fight them to the death here.</p>

		<p>First of all, the number of illegals is more like 20-35 million.  I think most people are beginning to realize that.  They don&rsquo;t have to actually BE deported though.  All that has to be done is to make it illegal to hire illegal aliens and enforce the law.  They&rsquo;ll then go back to Mexico and any other Latin American country that they&rsquo;re from - on their own.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken that&rsquo;s the way Eisenhower handled the situation back in the 1950&rsquo;s with &#8216;Operation W*****k&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to rid this country of 20 million? or so illegals.</p>
<p>-Have a plastic green card for all foreign nationals living here with a thumb print on it that can be entered into the system to verify who they are. This would prevent a lot of fraud.</p>
<p>-Require this new green card to be used by employers</p>
<p>-Harsh penalties for employers who hire illegals</p>
<p>-Regular unannounced checks by immigration in businesses likely to hire illegals.</p>
<p>-Get rid of the birthright provisions</p>
<p>-Any foreign nationals getting any subsidies ie. food stamps, must show new green card</p>

<p>With no money to be made, no anchor baby or no place to live, most of these illegals will deport themselves.</p>

		<p>I totally disagree deporting 12 million people, which is probably 30 million plus, is not realistic. If we enforce our laws, from employer checks to tight border control and periodically do deportation round ups like we used to do, over time, we will correct this problem. Of course to those who support the invasion and destruction of our country nothing is realistic except to continue to allow for that destruction.</p>
<p>It all starts with that first step and the will to do it&hellip;or not.</p>

		<p> There are literally thousands of railroad passenger cars that could be minimaly refurbished for a relatively small amount of money. <br>
 Gather them up in school buses, take them to the nearest railroad site, process them, take them to the nearest border crossing (this primarily applies to Mexicans) and march them across the border.<br>
 With all the facilities possible, from a purely logistical point of view, it would not be a huge problem.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The United States cannot deport all 12 million illegal aliens in the United States and should stop trying, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) told CNSNews.com last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong, Senorita &#8216;spokeswoman&rsquo; for La Raza, &#8220;The Race&#8221;.  Yes we can.  And, our survival as a Western European, First World nation depends on it.  </p>
<p>Not only should the European Founding Stock of this nation, which was founded, built and passed down to that same European majority by our 100 percent White European Founding Fathers, not stop &#8216;trying&rsquo; to deport every last one of these 12 million illegal aliens - we should in fact, INCREASE our efforts to identify, round up, and deport EVERY illegal alien by any and all means possible.   </p>
<p>In fact, a few of the other AR readers have already provided some excellent ideas on how this can be done.   Rewards for reporting suspected illegal aliens.   Massive fines for any employers caught with any illegal aliens on their payrolls.  Enacting laws that choke off the ability of any illegal alien to exist and prosper in any area of our society and nation.  Arizona style laws in every state across this nation.</p>
<p>Face facts, Senorita spokeswoman:  This issue is about &#8216;ownership&rsquo; of America, plain and simple.   Your people inhabit, own, and control every inch of geographic real estate from the Southern edge of the US-Mexico border all the way down to the remote tip of South America.   That is far more land mass than what constitutes the geographic area encompassed by the United States.  That land is your land, and this land is the property of the descendants of the Europeans who founded it, tamed it, settled it, created it and then passed it down to their European (not Mexican) posterity.    We are not going to allow your people to take this land away from the European majority, is that clear?    This nation is not up for grabs and is not &#8216;free land&rsquo; that can be colonized and stolen by any swarm of aliens who think they can sneak into our nation and then tell the current residents and property owners to go back to Europe, because the aliens are taking over.    America is NOT the property of the whole world, it is the property of the descendants of the European men and women who founded it.     Is that perfectly, crystal clear?  </p>
<p>Oh, and for any of those defeatists out there in the AR community who are thinking that we can &#8216;compromise&rsquo; with these La Raza race hustlers and grant &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; to those 12 million, who are likely far closer to 30-40 million, illegal aliens - and stupidly accept their assurances that they will then go along with &#8216;restoring the rule of law&rsquo;?  You can bet the farm on the fact that any such &#8216;amnesty&rsquo; will include liberal &#8216;family reunification provisions&rsquo; - and every one of those 12 or 40 million illegal aliens who are turned into citizens will turn right around and import every member of their family tree, who will in turn, import every member of their extended family tree  and the end result will be:  The genocide, death and extermination of White Western European Civilization. </p>
<p>Hence, those 12 or 40 million must go - no exceptions.   </p>
<p>Again, this country is not the land that belongs to people of Hispanic origins, or to any other people on this planet who might have designs upon stealing it.    Literally every one of these non-European immigrant groups have nations on this planet that their people inhabit, own and control.<br>
European people have every legitimate, moral, and just right to refuse to allow our nation to be stolen out from under us by any competing ethnic group.  We are under no obligation whatsoever to surrender our dominant position in America.  </p>
<p>Ownership.  That is the basis for this entire argument.   Never forget that, fellow AR readers.   Whites need to start acting like owners and assert ourselves.   Stop letting these minority race hustlers intimidate us into surrendering our inheritance!<br>

		<p>It is more like 20 million.  A good start would be boycotting corporations ( like Ford) that supports LaRaza.  Another positive step would be to grant Puerto Rico independence and eliminate that constant stream of welfare/food stamp recipients.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure every 10 years, just before the residency census, we would see a rise in self-deportations.</p>
<p>And in 10 years and 3 weeks, there would be a SHARP rise in ILLEGAL ENTRIES knowing they have another 10 years till their next vacation home. This must be an ongoing practice. Vehicles of employers (construction and such) who employ illegals should be impounded and sold at auction to finance the deportation/prosecution of ILLEGAL ALIENS along with HARSH financial penalties upon said employers.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Deporting 12 million people is not a realistic solution,&rdquo; she [NCLR Immigration Field Coordinator A. Elena Lacayo] wrote [in response to a question from CNS]. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we create a rational immigration system, take these people out of the shadows and restore the rule of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  We have a &#8220;rational immigration system&#8221; and we don&rsquo;t need to deport 12 million people. The Arizona law has demonstrated that illegal aliens will leave on their own when our country&rsquo;s immigration laws are enforced. Start rigorously fining employers who employ illegal law-breakers, expand E-Verify, don&rsquo;t give drivers licenses to illegal&rsquo;s, and don&rsquo;t allow the undocumented to take advantage of welfare services.  All of these measures will send illegal migrants back to their home countries.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not practical to do it in 24 hours, but it is practical.  I would much rather pay loyal Americans to do this rather than collect welfare.  All the jobs freed up by the deportation of 12 million criminals can be filled by those who work the deportation as it ends.  It has to be done.  </p>

		<p>Some things to keep in mind:</p>
<p>1.  The Hispanics of Mexico don&rsquo;t &#8216;own&rsquo; Mexico.  The 10% white minority does.  The &#8216;color continuum&rsquo; of Mexico starts at the bottom with very dark skinned Indians and proceeds upwards through a racial bigotry system of Mestizos who &#8216;wish they were&rsquo; white.  Only those rich enough to buy 2-3 generations of blonde wives are really empowered through a system of nepotistic cronyism the likes of which we would never (antitrust) put up with here.  While this doesn&rsquo;t in anyway excuse the beginnings of another such empire here in El Norte`; it is worth arguing that if we are racists then so are they and -at least theoretically- they should have an advantage in numbers to changing the political status quo, down south.  If they don&rsquo;t want their own land amongst their own kind but only the wealth of white men, then they are not here for &#8216;pure&rsquo; reasons of migration or racial/ethnic freedom either.</p>
<p>2.  Much as it may have been engineered by stupid wage rules.  Much as it may disgust us to admit it.  There -ARE- jobs which are fulfilled by Hispanics because they won&rsquo;t be by whites.  At least not at the levels which they need to be.  This is not to say that I don&rsquo;t believe that this fact can change with improved wage policies and perhaps even a &#8216;living wage&rsquo; dole (free housing, whatever) for those who truly -try- to work for a living in LMI jobs.  But, I think we need to come up with solutions which streamline society and improve the nature of the work being done.  Through massive automation.  Seriously folks, every successful society in the history of man has faced this &#8216;up and out, now we flout&rsquo; poor working class jobs issue.  And it has ALWAYS been solved with forms of slavery, paid or otherwise.  The difference is, today, we can do those jobs with machines that don&rsquo;t have to -be- paid.  And thus turn their work product over as &#8216;equivalencies&rsquo; to help fund some of these social indemnity (welfare) programs without taxing the mid/upper classes to run a nanny state.</p>
<p>We can solve this issue, relatively easily, with a repeat of Operation W*****k using digital-age scaling.  We can block off the Southern border and with ISR and weapons systems straight out of Star Wars.  But until we equally advance the cause of &#8216;four robots will pay for one welfare recipient&rsquo; or one Section 8 housing block or _whatever ratio it is_ that we need to sustain labor replacement at, we are just kidding ourselves if we think our economic and social issues will go away when those willing to do ugly manual work are banished south of the border.</p>
<p>Deporting illegal aliens is the absolutely necessary first step.  But there are going to be a whole host of others that come after it as we look to make up the shortfalls.  Prison chain gangs trading years of sentence of years of roadwork?  College students showing up to do stoop labor in the agro fields every harvest to help offset their tuition loans?</p>
<p>Or robots which, while taking a lot of effort to make into sustainable labor force will, eventually, be able to perform with such &#8216;swing&rsquo; efficiency (downloadable proficiency mods, on-arm tools and RISC based processors that have human-equivalent competency ratios).  And most importantly, these tools will be _reliable_.  They will never age out of the system.  Never want to move up in life.  Will be infinitely regenerable and indeed -cascadeable- between high end and secondary labor markets.  And will work 24/7/365 with minimal rest between infrastructure maintenance, construction and agricultural work.  Needing only to be driven to the point where their robotic intelligence picks up the object markers their programming &#8216;knows what to do with&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Such are the tools modern nations must look to when slave industries in the east out cheap us and slave labor from the south outbreed us.</p>
<p>There is no other, better, solution than -free-.</p>

		<p>Many commenters have already said it, but I&rsquo;ll say it again:</p>
<p>Make it next to impossible for illegals to work and they&rsquo;ll pack up and go home. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll tell the ones back in their home countries not to come here.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let them work. All else follows.</p>
<p>In my travels around the internet, I see most people understand this point, liberals and conservatives alike. Most people get that the key to the problem is the jobs part. I support AZ&rsquo;s law and I hope it holds up in the courts and that states pass similar laws, but in the end, to really solve the problem, you have to go to the root cause which is preventing illegals from working.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating to me that there isn&rsquo;t any major legislation being proposed by pols in either party to go straight to heart of the problem and solve it once and for all, despite the fact that most people understand the problem and support solving it this way.</p>
<p>If any politicians are out there reading this, you could be a historic figure if you were truly willing to lead on this issue. Look at the polls - most people would support you.</p>

<p>True, but that is because Whites can&rsquo;t afford to work these jobs for slave wages, pay taxes and still afford to feed their families. Before our nation gave the ok to import cheap 3rd world labor, Americans did all the jobs it is now said Americans won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;m also not saying that there are or have never been genuine job shortages. However, they can be handled without permanent legal or illegal immigration. They can be handled by a strictly controlled guest worker program. Foreign nationals, who pass criminal background and disease checks, can be allowed to come and work for say, a period of five years etc. Only the actual number of workers needed are allowed in. Then once the time of the guest worker&rsquo;s contract is up, they must go home and it is strictly enforced. Any children they have here go back with them. Many countries have this. </p>
