<h1>Teen Victim in Staten Island Hate Crime: &#8216;I Thought I Was Gonna Die&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barry Paddock, Rocco Parascondola, and Ryan Lavis, New York Daily News, August&nbsp;3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The teen victim of the most recent bloody bias attack on Staten Island said Monday his ordeal was so frightening, he thought he would die.</p>
<p>Christian Vazquez, 18, was kicked and punched to the ground by assailants allegedly yelling anti-Mexican slurs  &mdash;  the latest in asurge of black-on-Hispanic assaults.</p>
<p>A 15-year-old  &mdash;  himself an immigrant from Liberia  &mdash;  was arrested in the ambush, and Vasquez demanded the rest of his tormentors turn themselves in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The attack was the 11th bias incident in the Port Richmond area since April.</p>
<p>Mayor Bloomberg worried copycat attacks are keeping the trend rolling on Staten Island.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vazquez was returning home from his job as a busboy at a Manhattan restaurant early Saturday when he was approached just blocks from his home by a teenager who asked him if he was a member of a Mexican gang. As he denied any gang affiliation, he was attacked from behind by three men. They stole the $10 he had on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They started kicking me, calling me wetback, f  &mdash;  -ing Mexican, all these things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They hit me in the head so hard things were blurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was terrified,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I thought I was gonna die that night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 15-year-old charged in the attack, whose name is being withheld by the Daily News because he is a minor, was held after appearing at a hearing in Staten Island Family Court. The teen, who sported a Mohawk, is a U.S. citizen who moved here from Liberia, a police source said.</p>
<p>Vazquez  &mdash;  whose mother brought him to the U.S. from Mexico when he was just 5  &mdash;  has been active with a neighborhood youth group called Eye Openers Youth Against Violence for the past five years.</p>

		<p>Interesting to note that the Mexican teenager was returning home from a JOB, but the blacks were roving around in a gang. Do you suppose that the black teens would actually do the same work that the Mexican teen does? Do they work at a legitamate job at all? I often wonder why blacks sit back and seemingly refuse to do low-paying jobs that many Latin Americans will do(and risk their lives to come here illegally) yet then complain they achieve nothing. Interesting to note that even the immigrant youth from Liberia acted as violent. </p>

<p>Is it because they know what will happen in a fair fight?</p>
<p>Just look at this video that surfaced today. In typical black fashion, a large black guy sucker punches a smaller white woman. Yes, he is twice her size but still felt the need to sucker punch her. </p>
<p>A smaller guy - who happened to be MMA fighter Roger Huerta - intervenes. They fight and the next thing you know the black criminal is unconscious. </p>

<p>These criminologists will tell you that you can tell a lot about a perpetrator of a crime by looking at the victims. If the victims are all old, feeble, young, weak, etc., the perp is some sort of latent coward. NOT able to fight a person who may give even the slightest amount of resistance. This decision to attack on the part of the perp is done unconciously, without thinking. Most predators in the wild do the same. Attack the old, sick, feeble, young, etc. Human animalistic predators emulating the wild!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Bias attack&#8221;? This is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard that one!<br>
If it were a bunch of White lads, it would not be &#8216;bias&rsquo;, it would be full blown HATE crime!</p>
<p>&#8220;A 15-year-old &mdash; himself an immigrant from Liberia &mdash; &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is the fact that he&rsquo;s an &#8216;immigrant from Liberia&rsquo; meant to make him automatically kind to all immigrants? If he attacked (more likely, raped or bashed) a native born White American would the article point that out?</p>
<p>I thought &#8216;bias&rsquo; was being in favour of a certain group (usually a small locality or even a sporting team) or your own child, usually in a way that doesn&rsquo;t involve actually abusing and hitting and kicking people!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They started kicking me, calling me w*****k, f*****g Mexican, all these things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They hit me in the head so hard things were blurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bias - black style!</p>

<p>Ive been telling people the same exact thing, man. They ALWAYS have to group up to accomplish any deed. Theyre cowards in the first degree and people are finally realizing this.</p>
<p>I had a black tell me one day in the line at jail to get my tray of putrid food before I bonded out that blacks are scared of a crazy White man.</p>
<p>They are attempting to scare Whites into submission and subjugation. They  want to dominate Whites and they will try to do it one by one.</p>
<p>The problem with their plan is that We, the White Americans are at a boiling point to where the law will not be able to protect them when we&rsquo;ve had enough collectively.</p>
<p>Ive been fed up with it for years and have been talking to people I meet and already know&hellip;but I always got called a (RACIST!!!).</p>
<p>Now&hellip;.they are the racists because they see it now.</p>
<p>I am a Proud Racist and I make no bones about it. If someone is not a Race-Realist, Racist or a Racialist I dont consider them to be intelligent. Just indoctrinated.</p>

<p>Bernie:</p>
<p>I did take a look at the video you posted and it is good.  I couldn&rsquo;t make out exactly how Huerta brought down the large black guy but I know it&rsquo;s possible because MMA is on in my home all the time!</p>
<p>These ever-present video cameras and cell phones have been a God-send for all of us, especially the police.  In Los Angeles, the city has been trying to equip all police cars with video monitors for two decades now but there always seems to be a problem  &mdash;  not enough money, threats from activists that the cameras are intrusive and violate rights to privacy, the cameras breaking down constantly, etc.</p>
<p>Those cameras go a long way to show the real side of the story and circumvent a lot of charges or police brutality.  As I read about a public defender assigned to a brutal attacker who had his entire family present in court to claim he was nowhere near the crime scene:  &#8220;Video don&rsquo;t lie!&#8221; (the victim was a small gay man who was being attacked daily on his own property by a gang of &#8216;youths&rsquo; trying to drive him out of the neighborhood, he&rsquo;d finally had enough and installed a cameras to capture the attacks as he knew the police didn&rsquo;t believe him and wouldn&rsquo;t protect him). </p>
<p>As for the attacks on Staten Island  &mdash;  welcome to the diversity we&rsquo;ve been privy to here in California for two decades  &mdash;  diversity meaning Hispanics ethnically cleansing blacks neighborhood by neighborhood while black politicians such as Maxine Waters (D- rating from NumbersUSA) continue to demand that the southern border be left wide open.</p>
<p>One thing about hispanics   &mdash;   they are tribal, have long memories, and believe strongly in revenge and retaliation when members of their tribe are attacked.   The government allows them (unlike us Whites) to form advocacy groups complete with screaming activists demanding government action.  Meanwhile, powerful Hispanic gangs will extract revenge against blacks  &mdash;  from the streets to the prisons  &mdash;   and it will be violent and bloody, count on it.</p>
<p>But it will also send a strong message to blacks to get out now or get killed, as that is how ethnic cleansing works.  The only solution for Whites, because we are forced into an &#8216;every man, woman and child for himself&rsquo; position is to be armed and ready at all times and to let blacks know that we will fight back with deadly force if we are attacked.  It is the only way.</p>

		<p>A pox on both sides involved in this.  Whites are attacked every day in New York under similar circumstances to the total silence and support of both the government and the media.  The publicity these attacks are getting is just another thumb in the eye to all those tens of millions of white victims who have been assaulted since the 1960s.    This is just another defense of multiculturalism, the ultimate gaol of which is the literal physical extermination of whites.   This isn&rsquo;t about defending poor Hispanics who are the victims of racial assaults,  it&rsquo;s about making multiculturalism (i.e. the destruction of whites) work.</p>
<p>Whether blacks commit hate crimes in packs is not really relevant, what is relevant is the fact that they are allowed to get away with it.   They&rsquo;re the brown shirts of the liberal movement,  and the details of how they accomplish their mission is not that important.  What is important is the existence of the mission itself and the way those in power sponsor it.   There can hardly be a better example of the attitude of this death machine than the mass murder in Connecticut.   The boards are filled with blacks and liberals cheering the murderer.   Carping about blacks is not productive,  pointing out the connection between the violence and leftist politics is.  You&rsquo;ve got to go to the source and make people understand that this political movement and its party are genocidally and murderously racist against whites at their roots,  and that won&rsquo;t change, except superficially for tactical reasons.  They want you dead, and nothing else matters.</p>

		<p>As an aside,I saw that,well,that woman Sarah Palin (all stand and cheer!!) on TV last night. Dear Sarah wants to crackdown on &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221;. Whoop dee do! But she also noted that &#8220;legal immigration is the sincerest form of flattery.&#8221; So LEGAL immigration is ok. The immigration that brought Liberians,Somalians,Nigerians,Muslims of all stripes into our country is OK  &mdash;  its a form of flattery! Maybe as a woman,flattery is beloved by Sarah,but I would rather do away with this murderous tide of destruction,whether its &#8220;legal&#8221; or not! My God! Liberians crawling through the streets of our cities. Somalians living in our towns!! Immigration is genocide! Its racial destruction. ALL immigration,except for WHITE PEOPLE,is wrong.</p>

		<p>10 John:</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh has said similar things in the debate over 1070.  You know, illegal bad, but legal good, blah blah, and that it was somehow &#8220;difficult&#8221; for &#8220;high skilled&#8221; people to immigrate here legally.  (Bull.)  There&rsquo;s the poison pill when it comes to lamestream conservatism on immigration   &mdash;   Mouth off just enough good rhetoric to keep the masses fooled, but slip in the poison pill of virtually unlimited legal immigrant visas to keep the big corporations happy with their cheap labor.  Note that a lot of lamestream conservative think tanks get a lot of funding from those same corporations.</p>
<p>I have Sarah Palin her chance.  She&rsquo;s standing up for Jan Brewer, but only because the wind got so heavy in her (Palin&rsquo;s) face that she had to turn around.  When the wind wasn&rsquo;t blowing in her face, she was saying that it was &#8220;inhumane&#8221; to deport illegals, and she endorsed a Mexican Consulate Office with Matricula Mickey Mouse Card issuing powers in Anchorage.  Actions speak louder than words.  The essence of doing &#8220;the right thing&#8221; is doing the right thing when nobody is looking.</p>
<p>Mike Huckabee is another one that&rsquo;s about to phony his way into 180-ing on the immigration issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/263r6o6" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/263r6o6</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that as Governor of Arkansas, he was amnesty and open borders all the way.  Mainly because Tyson loves that cheap Hispanic labor.</p>

<p>Not likely. Mexican gangs in New York are greatly outnumbered by blacks and mulatto hispanics and are thus nowhere near as aggressive as the ones on the west coast. The fact that blacks feel free to target Mexicans in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood that undoubtedly has many Mexican gang members speaks volumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;The fact that blacks feel free to target Mexicans in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood that undoubtedly has many Mexican gang members speaks volumes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how it started in California. Mexican gangs have had a very long presence in California but hispanics were still attacked at will by violent blacks, even in hispanic neighborhoods. Hispanics were pushed, spat upon, mocked, laughed at, robbed, threatened, their children assaulted in schools.  They haven&rsquo;t forgotten this.</p>
<p>My first teaching job in the early 80s was at a school that was at the time 85% black, 10% hispanic (the remainder unknown) and located in an historic black area  &mdash;  hispanic children were targeted daily for robbery and assault. I spent lunch hour in my room with 35 small, scared hispanic kids who were terrified of the larger, aggressive, violent, crime-prone blacks who attacked and robbed them in the mosh-pit that was the student lunch area.  Very little to nothing was done.  Last time I checked, my old school is close to 89% hispanic and 10% black, as is every school in the area now.</p>
<p>Hispanics first moved into historic black areas such as Watts and Compton  &mdash;   at great risk to their lives.  Over the course of the last 30 years, they began to greatly outnumber blacks both through significantly higher birth rates and unfettered illegal immigration.  Both Watts and Compton are now majority hispanic: Watts 60.8% Latino, 38.0% black, Compton:  56.8%  Hispanic, 40.0% black.  And that&rsquo;s from the 2000 census.  When the new 2010 census comes out, I expect the hispanic percentage to be much higher as we&rsquo;ve been told by the local media that blacks are &#8216;heading back to the South.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hispanics have no illusions about violent black behavior and don&rsquo;t want them around their children, in their schools, in their neighborhoods, in their cities and they did something about it  &mdash;  their gangs became armed and violent, both to compete in and expand the drug trade and to drive blacks away from their &#8216;business&rsquo; and their people.  Virtually every prison riot in California is hispanic-on-black.  </p>
<p>I understand &#8216;Le Eme&rsquo; (the violent mexican mafia) and MS-13 (a violent salvadorean drug gang whose favorite method of execution is cutting off of the head with a machete) are expanding rapidly on the East Coast.  </p>
<p>And still the border remains wide open.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but I doubt that Mexicans will ever have the demographic advantage in New York that they have in Southern California.</p>

<p>La Eme has very little if any influence on the east coast. The largest Mexican gangs in New York are homegrown and have no affiliation with them. MS-13 is just one of a million street gangs in New York  &mdash;  neither one of the largest nor the most violent.</p>

		<p>An immigrant from Liberia?  That&rsquo;s bizarre, when you think about it.</p>
<p>Liberia was created to take blacks FROM here, not to send more of them TO here.  That was the whole idea behind its founding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like a sink that has gotten backed-up and is working the wrong way.  It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be like this!</p>
<p>In fact, our whole government has been working like a clogged-up sink that is running in the wrong direction.  Nothing was originally intended to be like this. It needs some serious plumbing work to clean it out and get it working properly again.</p>
