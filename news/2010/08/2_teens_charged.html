<h1>2 Teens Charged As Adults in Skateworks Gang Rape</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Madigan, Baltimore Sun, August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two teens accused in the gang rape of a 12-year-old girl at the Woodlawn skating rink Saturday night have been charged as adults, prosecutors said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kadeem R. Santiful, 17, and Tracey W. Hankins, 15, both of Baltimore, are accused of first-degree rape, first-degree sex offense and other charges in the attack at Skateworks.</p>
<p>Davon Perry, 24, of Pikesville had been charged previously with the same counts.</p>
<p>The girl told police Saturday that the trio had taken turns holding her down and raping her in a room used to store party supplies, and that they had forced her to perform sex acts on each of them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 12-year-old, interviewed at Franklin Square Hospital Center, told a detective that she and a girlfriend were at a party at the rink when &#8220;three male subjects approached them.&#8221; Two grabbed the victim and &#8220;dragged her&#8221; into the storage room, while the third tried to pull her girlfriend elsewhere, according to the document.</p>
<p>After the attack, the girl dressed and found her friend, police said. The friend told police that they had been apart for 20 minutes and that the 12-year-old had been crying. {snip}</p>
<p>At the hospital, the girl &#8220;was visibly upset and on the verge of crying,&#8221; the detective wrote. The girl was quoted as saying, &#8220;I told them to stop and they did not stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The document says the girl &#8220;became extremely upset and started to cry, and said, &#8216;I want my mommy.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the victim was black, since this roller rink has been repeatedly been in the news for it&rsquo;s vibrant and diverse herds of &#8220;youth&#8221;.  </p>

<p><i>Police officers have reported unruly crowds, fistfights, thefts and general rowdiness, mostly outside the rink in an industrial park off Whitehead Road as the crowds leave at midnight. Some nights, police say, hundreds of teenagers dart across the six lanes of Security Boulevard to congregate at a bus stop.</i></p>
<p><i>Police have been called to the rink or its immediate environs 196 times in the past 16 months. A year ago, two men were shot about 3 a.m. in a parking lot behind the rink&hellip;</i><br>

		<p>Woodlawn is a very black area of Baltimore County, so the odds are that the victim was also black. Not that it excuses such behavior, but better they do it to their own than to ours. Just the same, these guys will never get the punishment they really deserve for such a terrible act.</p>

		<p>Perhaps one day, Jared Taylor can produce another crime report that shows the rape and sexual assault rates broken down by black, hispanic, pacific islander <br>
and middle eastern/arab/iranian.</p>
<p>I would be willing to bet that the already high per-capita rate amoung these groups is continuing to skyrocket; especially in gang attacks.       </p>

		<p>Imagine what life will be like in the USA when Africans and Hispanics become 50% or 75% of the USA population. At this very moment, the USA State Department is busy working to import an additional hundreds of thousands of &#8220;refugee&#8221; Africans into the USA over the next decade.  Meanwhile, Obama is doing everything possible NOT to deport the 20 million or so illegal Hispanics and to also keep the southern border open for even more migration.  </p>
<p>In poll after poll after poll, the majority of USA citizens say that they want the border closed and a reduction in massive immigration   &mdash;   especially during this time of economic downturn and high unemployment.  Yet, our government continues to thumb its nose at the people.  </p>
<p>The idea of a democracy is to prevent civil war by basing decisions on what the majority of the citizens want.   </p>

Last Friday, we had a shooting in a downtown restaurant. 8 people were shot, 4 dead. Over 100 people in attendance. No witnesses have come forward.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to point out the rampant pathology of the black community, I&rsquo;m called a &#8216;racist&rsquo;. &#8216;It&rsquo;s not a black problem. It&rsquo;s a society problem. The same things happen in white communities&rsquo;. Etc&hellip;<br>

		<p>Woodlawn High is probably the worst high school in Baltimore County. I think its catchment area is the same area as that wonderful government program, the Social Security Administration (just to give you an idea of who some of the mammas might be&hellip;). When I drive by on the beltway, I think of it as City of the Sun&hellip;</p>

		<p>Yes the victim is almost certainly black. The website shows all black patrons and advertises in all caps &#8220;SECURITY PATROLS CONSTANTLY, WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY&#8221; and also advertises for &#8220;Sweet 16 Birthday Parties&#8221; (yes really&hellip;lol).</p>

<p>TRUST me on this, the blacks are still allowed into the Army. I see black women who are 5&rsquo;4&#8221; or less and apparently weigh 200lbs so the actually WADDLE instead of walk, and black males that can barely speak coherent English and appear to be on drugs! and the Army is made up of what looks to be 60% of these people. I said before, they are in a welfare program with a paycheck, a uniform and they get to carry a weapon and have access to White women.</p>

		<p>Also the statements of the accused are gems in their own right, the fact the police and the reporter shared them shows a bit of hope.</p>
<p><i>Hankins told a detective that he had sex with the girl but denied forcing her. Hankins said she &#8220;never told him to stop&#8221; and that he had &#8220;no idea&#8221; what the others did with her.</i></p>
<p>Santiful told police he &#8220;walked in&#8221; on Hankins and the girl having sex and that after Hankins left the room, he &#8220;allowed&#8221; the girl to perform a sexual act on him.</p>
<p>Perry denied ever having been in the storage room with the girl, said he had not performed any sexual acts with her and did not see anyone else doing so, according to the document.<br>

		<p>Woodlawn is HORRIBLE and has been for a long time. I grew up in another section of Baltimore County and was told that many, many years ago Woodlawn was actually a pretty nice area. The blacks moved in and have completely invaded and destroyed it (Ah, the joys of diversity!) Just a few days ago there was another case of a black &#8220;youff&#8221; going ballistic in Woodlawn   &mdash;   he murdered his 61-year old neighbor, then set her body on fire. I have to admit I&rsquo;m no longer all that phased by it; I&rsquo;ve come to expect these things after seeing 20+ years of grisly news reports with a steady stream of black suspects.</p>
<p>I can still remember going to the mall in Woodlawn with my mother as a child. It was a good bit whiter then but still had its fair share of blacks. As we sat down in the food court, gun shots suddenly rang out. One black man dropped to the ground and a whole herd of them came running at him from the opposite end of the mall, screaming &#8220;hit him wit da knuckles!&#8221; My mother and I rushed out of the mall and vowed never to go in there again.</p>
<p>At another mall in the same area, right around the same time in the late 80s, a beloved elementary school teacher (white of course) was gunned down for no reason at all. </p>
<p>The moral of the story (and all of us here already know) is to stay as far away from these areas as possible. The problem is that eventually there will be no more places for us to go and I&rsquo;m very afraid we are right on the cusp of that.</p>

		<p>I agree with #2 that the victim was likely black.  The reason I think so, aside from the locale, is that her friend apparently did not go to management or call the cops regarding males dragging her off into a room!  What did either one of these girls think would happen in that room?  And what did other skaters suppose was going on?  I once read about a black rapist who assaulted a crippled woman on a street in broad daylight in a black area.  Some spectators simply walked by.  One later claimed he thought they were &#8220;just having sex&#8221;!  Can you imagine this happening among white people?</p>

		<p>Baltimore County used to be all white.  A donut surrounding Baltimore City and its crimes Now the neighborhoods like this one where the rape happened are all black. The white areas are miles away, in still rural or wealthy horse country type settings. Jews live in neighborhoods about five miles from the rape. They are being pushed out of neighborhoods they&rsquo;ve lived in for decades. Many are Orthodox; with political and social views as conservative as Tom Tancredo or Jim Demint. But the state and local govt&rsquo;s keep pushing testing that favors blacks, diversity programs that penalized gifted and law abiding students, public housing and vouchers, and affirmative action to put blacks in charge of a school system that is still slightly majority white They are the product of the school system that Baltimore County and ultra liberal governor and ex Baltimore Mayor Martin O&rsquo;Malley, renegade Irishman, have imposed in the name of equality and diversity.</p>
<p>The highly overrated populist panderer and hypocrite Jefferson is our misfortune.  All men are not created equal. No they aren&rsquo;t Glenn Beck. Neither the Constitution nor the Declaration of Independence are perfect. Time for a new charter that favors civilization as the Greeks and Romans understood it.</p>

		<p>When we travel in our RV and are forced to stop anywhere in Maryland west of the Chespeake, we make certain our weapons are at the ready.  Places like Ellicot, Haggerston Belair,and anywhere near DC are places that rival Detriot and New Orleans in senseless violence.The only rule young blacks follow is, &#8221; Don`t Snitch.&#8221;Hatred seems to burn out of their eye sockets.Baltimore becomes a ghost town after dark.The state has Draconian gun laws that have worked sensationally. Every recent piece of legislation has been passed through a prism of not upsetting the 35% black minority. My advice to whites,Asians, Jews, and decent blacks,get the heck out before you become a statistic.<br>

<p>Here&rsquo;s Jefferson on Blacks:</p>
<p>It will probably be asked, Why not retain and incorporate the blacks into the state, and thus save the expence of supplying, by importation of white settlers, the vacancies they will leave? Deep rooted prejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries they have sustained; new provocations; the real distinctions which nature has made; and many other circumstances, will divide us into parties, and produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination of the one or the other race.-</p>
<p>He goes on to enumerate the differences as he saw them, and they&rsquo;re practically the same difference we see today.  You can read it here:</p>

<p>sbuffalonative,<br>
Don&rsquo;t these people ever stop to consider what they say? There was a family BBQ in Pleasantville NJ ( Pleasantville is a small town on the mainland about 11 miles from Atlantic City. It used to be a quiet town worthy of its name). At about 12:30 a.m. and argument broke out among some of the 100 attendees and one of them drew a gun and opened fire. Several people were wounded. The town no predominantly Black and Hispanic has been plagued by gang violence and irresponsible gunfire for the last several years. The residents and ministers have done the obligatory candle vigils, &#8220;Night out&#8221; and plenty of platitude filled speeches; all to no avail.<br>
There simply is NO PLACE where they are in significant numbers were there is peace and tranquility.<br>
Yes, it&rsquo;s a societal problem all right; one visited on us by the actions of the progressives who took power while we were alseep at the switch anaesthetized by our sports, reality shows and our electronic toys . We&rsquo;ll camp overnight outside Best Buy to get the new IPod or outside a stadium for sports or concert tickets but we won&rsquo;t stand outside the seats of power to demand an end to this insanity.</p>

<p>Sorry pal, homosexuality will finish off our people. No dice.</p>
<p>And fyi, it took a bloody civil war for all of these things to come to pass, not a failure of the Constitution. We had a coup instigated by foreigners. </p>
<p>P.S. Our free peoples crushed the Romans like the pathetic, control freak worms they were under the Empire. Their strength was gained under the old Republic, lost under the vices of empire.</p>
