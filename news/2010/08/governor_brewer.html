<h1>Governor Brewer Takes On the United Nations, The US Department of State and the Obama Administration (Again)</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Kelly, Tucson Citizen, August 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In correspondence sent today to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Governor Jan Brewer has condemned the &#8220;Universal Periodic Review&#8221; report submitted to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Governor Brewer has requested that Secretary Clinton amend the report to the United Nations to remove the paragraph on S.B. 1070.</p>
<p>In her letter to Secretary of State Clinton, Governor Brewer stated &#8220;Simply put, it is downright offensive that the State Department included the State of Arizona and S.B. 1070 in a report to the United Nations Council on Human Rights, whose members include such renowned human rights &#8216;champions&rsquo; as Cuba and Libya.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}  Governor Brewer stated that &#8220;If the federal government secured the entire border and enforced our immigration laws, these human rights problems would not be occurring for citizens, legal residents and illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of the United Nations Human Rights Council are set to review the Administration&rsquo;s controversial and unprecedented report later this year. The letter to the Secretary requests that the Administration amend and remove the offensive section of the report relating to the State of Arizona and S.B. 1070. If not removed, Governor Brewer stated that &#8220;the State of Arizona will fight any attempt by the U.S. Department of State and the United Nations to interfere with the duly enacted laws of the State of Arizona in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Gov Brewer is correct as to the lack of jurisdiction and the lack of substance to Prez Hussein&rsquo;s ridiculous insertion of the Arizona law into UN reports. The UN itself is a violation of human rights, exemplified by its constant disregard of the right to privacy and to the right of property owners.</p>
<p>However, much of what the USA has done under such similar Presidents like Reagan, Bush(both) and Clinton(who loved everyBODY) should meet the stringent standards of even the ultrademocracies like Libya that run the UN.</p>
<p>Restrictions on cops&rsquo; finding out citizenship of criminals, poor enforcement of employment rules against illegals and permitting illegals and their kids to use our health care system and education system at no cost surely constitute &#8216;mitigating&rsquo; circumstances.</p>
<p>Perhaps Bill Clinton can take the UN bureaucrats out to dinner and &#8220;entertain&#8221; them to convince them that we Americans are just OK guys after all. </p>
<p>Gov Brewer is terrific, but she thinks that writing a letter is useful. Pull out your credit card and put on your party clothes,Governor, if you really want to convince the organization of Peace that you have a point.</p>

		<p>The only question that matters is, has Brewer gotten together in secret with various other governors and made plans to challenge Obama for control of the United States.</p>
<p>If not, she is simply putting on a show for the cameras while nothing changes.</p>
<p>But there is a strong probability that this has, in fact happened.</p>
<p>If that is so, then it is time for every white person to choose sides.  Because, if you don&rsquo;t, that choice will be made for you.  And you probably will NOT be allowed to move, if a stalemate occurs and the US splits in two.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s amerika is likely to strongly resemble east germany before the wall came down&hellip;..or more to the point, zimbabwe.</p>

		<p>As long as Hilary is spouting off about American violations of human rights, maybe she could bring up the issue of White prison inmates having their &#8220;human right&#8221; not to be raped violated by mostly Black and Hispanic inmates.</p>

		<p>With such a document as is being sent to the U.N. (of all places) I believe that just having a job does not entitle Ms. Clinton to the title &#8220;Honorable&#8221; for THAT! she surely is not!</p>

		<p>The UN are an organisation numerically dominated by non-Whites. </p>
<p>Has the time come to dissolve the United Nations? I think it is probably the case. White countries need to be able to manage their own affairs, without representatives from Third World nations making objections.</p>
<p>Besides, some of the nations so represented, are countries where most people live in shacks or huts; some others, are South American cocaine cartels. Why should their representatives, be allowed to vote on any serious question?</p>
