			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Doyle, Daily Mail (London), August 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just one in ten babies is born to a white British mother in some parts of the country, figures reveal.</p>
<p>The statistics  &mdash;  based on NHS monitoring of the ethnicity and nationality of patients  &mdash;  show a sharp contrast in the backgrounds of new mothers in urban and rural areas.</p>
<p>While white British mothers accounted for just 9.4 per cent of all births in one London health trust, the figure was 97.4 per cent of all births in Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust.</p>
<p>The birth statistics reflect how mothers described themselves, not the ethnicity of the fathers or the babies.</p>
<p>Across all of England&rsquo;s 150 NHS Trusts there were 652,638 deliveries last year, around six out of ten of them to women who called themselves white British.</p>
<p>But in some trusts serving rural areas more than 95 per cent of mothers fell into that category.</p>
<p>These included Northern Devon with 97.4 per cent, Co Durham and Darlington with 97.1, and Northumbria with 96 per cent.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, in North West London Hospitals NHS Trust, which covers Harrow, just 9.4 per cent of mothers were white British. Another inner city trust  &mdash;  Sandwell and West Birmingham  &mdash;  had 16.5 per cent. And a little over one in four new mothers were white Britons at Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; hospital in central London.</p>
<p>The proportion of mothers of white British origin at Bradford Teaching Hospitals trust was 34 per cent.</p>
<p>Even some NHS trusts in the home counties reported fewer than six in ten deliveries were to white British mothers.</p>
<p>In West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which covers St Albans, just 57 per cent of women giving birth were white British.</p>
<p>Across England 62 per cent of all births last year involved a white British mother.</p>
<p>The largest other single ethnic groups were &#8216;other white&rsquo;  &mdash;  including Eastern Europeans  &mdash;  which made up 7 per cent of births, black (5 per cent), Pakistani (4 per cent) and Indian (3 per cent).</p>
<p>Of the rest of the mothers 8 per cent described their ethnicity as &#8216;other&rsquo; (including mixed-race women) and the remainder were listed as &#8216;not known&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Backbench Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: &#8216;I think we have to face reality and that is if you continue to have mass immigration it&rsquo;s going to have a very significant impact on the demography of our country  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s going to have a significant impact perhaps on the sort of country that we are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last month it emerged that Britain&rsquo;s population growth is outpacing every other country in Europe.</p>
<p>Immigration and rising birth rates driven in part by the children of new arrivals  &mdash;  the so- called &#8216;immigrant baby boom&rsquo;  &mdash;  meant the UK gained more people than anywhere else in the continent.</p>
<p>Ministers have proposed forcing non EU migrants to buy their own private health care for non-emergency treatment on the NHS.</p>
<p>David Cameron has pledged to reduce the level of net migration  &mdash;  the number of people arriving minus the number leaving  &mdash;  from the hundreds to the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has proposed putting a limit on the number of immigrants from outside the EU given work permits for the UK.</p>

		<p>These figures do not include Scotland and Wales which account for about 16% of the UK population. I would say that 95% or more of babies born in these two regions are white so the overall figure for white mothers would be nearer 70%.</p>
<p>White mother does not mean white father. We also have health tourism, whereby foreigners, mainly middle-class, come to Britain to give birth. No idea what the numbers are though.</p>
<p>East-Europeans make up about 7% of the yearly total which is 45 thousand. In total I would say there are about 200 thousand East-european children in the UK. The UK gov has a site which gives some data. We will probably be able to assimilate them. The last Labour Government said that only 13 thousand East-Europeans would move to the UK once the restrictions on travel where lifted in 2004. I don&rsquo;t how much it costs to have a child but I do know that each school pupil has about 7K spent on them by the state. Most EEs are in work but they do claim a lot of state benefits in one way or another, now.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have more children? We could easily double our birth rate for ten or fifteen years.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s happening to whites in the US and UK seems a repeat of what happened to the natives of north America. It&rsquo;s being brought to you by the same &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; and enlightened folks who say we must never forget, and that we all can do more - at least more for persons of color. When you become sensitive and discerning enough - you realize people of color are the only ones who really count as people.  </p>

		<p> For one who remembers the almost all-white all-British England of the 1950&rsquo;s this is heartbreaking. But, while the situation is certainly grave it&rsquo;s not,perhaps,quite as bad as the figures suggest. These are statistics after all, and we all know about &#8220;damn lies&#8221; and so forth!</p>
<p>For one thing, these figures relate only to England, the other countries of the UK - with about 15% of its population between them - are much whiter.<br>
Secondly, a similar survey conducted in 2003/2004 showed that white British mothers were involved in only 57.8% of births, so the position seems to have improved!!! <br>
Thirdly, note that in 11% of births the ethnicity of the mothers is not accounted for, but in that 2003/2004 survey there was evidence to suggest that the similarly large &#8220;unaccounted&#8221; element was in fact white British.<br>
Fourthly, some of the 7% &#8220;other white&#8221; mothers will, in fact, have given birth to white British babies because, for example, they are married to British men, or are themselves of British descent although not British citizens - there are numerous Americans, Australians etc. in Britain and they easily and naturally marry locally.<br>
Fifthly, and finally, the Office for National Statistics (a different body from the one which produced these figures) calculated that in the year to mid 2007 - only two years prior to this survey -  that 78% of births in England were white British!</p>
<p>Well, there you are, the statistics are puzzling and I don&rsquo;t really know where the truth lies, but based on my own amateur nunber crunching, I would be surprised and disappointed if the proportion of white British births were not much nearer to 70% than to 62% - for the moment.</p>

		<p>Right here in the late great United States of America only 50% of births are to whites.  Here as in so many things America leads the Western world.  As John Derbyshire said about the situation generally, &#8220;We Are Doomed&#8221;.</p>
<p>None of our opponents can provide the slightest evidence that America&rsquo;s technological or economic position will be improved by having an increasingly black and Mestizo population.  Nor can they provide any evidence that this will improve our schools or reduce crime.  All they can do is sit back on their haunches and howl at us as for being racists because we provide the evidence that it will have the opposite effects.</p>
<p>As for Great Britain, the Pakistani population there seems no more beneficial than the Mestizo population here.  (We get Mexican drug lords, they get Muslim mad bombers.)  But in Orwellian Great Britain you can get locked up for saying so.<br>

		<p>Actually, what&rsquo;s happening is that a lot of new immigrants are moving to the UK from the EU and Poland.  More are coming from Africa and even more from the Indian subcontinent.  All the groups are relatively young and in an age range to give birth.  Also, many of these groups were strapped for cash in their homelands, so they feel prosperous enough in Britain to finally have a child (or 2nd/3rd child) when they reach the UK.  A study found that immigrants tend to have a much higher birthrate in their first few years after immigration, but then there is a major decrease in subsequent years.</p>
<p>For example, even Poles, who are just 0.6% of the UK&rsquo;s population, account for 2.3% of births - 4 times the British average.  However, I&rsquo;d wager that after a few years, the current cohort of Polish will have far fewer kids.  So their birthrate should fall to average.  This trend has been seen in many other groups, including the Senegalese blacks in France.  High fertility in the initial years, but then it falls.  </p>
<p>So when you read that African/Asian immigrants have high birthrates, keep in mind those rates will go down for that particular immigrant cohort.</p>
<p>The problem is that the UK keeps bringing in more and more new immigrant cohorts.  If the UK stopped all immigration tomorrow, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with new immigrant cohorts and old immigrant cohorts would see their fertility decrease.  So this high non-white birthrate issue isn&rsquo;t that dire, if immigration is stopped.  If no stop to immigration, then yeah, UK is screwed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the way, fertility</p>

		<p>What matter is not the overall percentage but the birth rate. From my understanding, native English have a birthrate of 1.3 (I believe the Scots and Welsh have a similar one.) No group of people have ever survived a 1.3 birthrate, and because of that, the current percentage, be it 62% or 70%, is destined to drop. </p>

		<p>Anonymous @4 said it right. Too many white girls are having black babies. It seems to be some kind of badge of &#8220;coolness&#8221;. So the statistics are, if anything, worse.  </p>
<p>White guys don&rsquo;t go with black women for social reasons, aesthetic appearance and hygiene. Blacks go with white skanks who want sex and drugs.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the fathers disappear and the mums get benefits, housing, schooling, money for furniture etc &hellip;.and a life sat on their fat butts.</p>
<p>Muslims however prefer &#8220;grooming&#8221; white girls. <a href="http://bit.ly/bxtnWu" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/bxtnWu</a></p>

		<p>Why should anyone be suprised at this &#8220;revelation&#8221;.Since 1997 there has been a systematic programme of population replacement,this in combination with an already over-large non-Anglo-Saxon presence was bound to manifest itself in such figures.It is pointless to argue that these figures do not include Scotland or Wales(themselves increasingly enriched),they are de-facto independent nations thanks to the same Blairist regime that deliberately initiated this genocide.</p>

		<p>I think these &#8220;white&#8221; British girls are giving birth to mulatto babies. It seems (from observation) to be the in thing to be having black, caribbean or even black African boyfriends and when the race of the mother is given as WHITE, it by no means indicates the race of the baby. Lots of Pakistanis rape White girls too, and many will eventually give birth to said Pakistani baby.</p>

		<p>You can spin it any way you like, factoring in the majority-white populations of the (actually far more sparsely populated) Scotland and Wales, but this still represents the death of England as a nation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also significant that the areas where there is the highest incidence of births to non-English mothers (most of whom come from the third world) is in the most densely populated urban areas: London, Birmingham, the North-West, the West Riding of Yorkshire, etc.</p>
<p>The supposed &#8220;silver lining&#8221; is that in rural backwaters, like North Devon, indigenous mothers are still (for the time being) in the majority. A veritable drop in the ocean. As you Americans say, &#8220;Do the math.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>@GeoffM: Alas, you are so correct about white English girls &amp; black men. Me &amp; my wife visited London in 2002. If there is one emotion that comes to mind as regards to my trip it was heartbreak!. For here, one of the western worlds greatest cities rapidly descending to third world status!. Blacks &amp; Pakistanis seemed to outnumber the white Londoners everywhere!. The amount of litter &amp; graffitti was also appalling. The most disturbing aspect though was the amount of white women/black men couples that we saw. It appeared that it was at least every 3rd or forth white women pairing was this! (& I&rsquo;m talking attractive/quality white women, not the low end of the genetic scale that is so often the case in the US)&hellip;We realised that England may very well be lost, for if you lose your women without so much as a murmer then your civilisation WILL die!!&hellip;..On a positive note, the British museum is amazing!.</p>

		<p>It would seem that females are the same anywhere   &mdash;   dumb and impressionable.  What else compels a presumably healthy white Englishwoman to cast her lot with a Muzzie or an Afro?  Intelligence?  It used to be a badge of shame to even talk of such mating.  Now it&rsquo;s a badge of &#8220;honor.&#8221;  Bring back the Sex Pistols one more time.  </p>
<p>Mr. Powell predicted this would come to pass over 40 years ago.  Few listened.  Now their progeny are paying (or imposing) the price.   </p>

		<p>I like to come to AmRen, as I think this is a great source of brutally honest news. However, I&rsquo;ve recently found that I just can&rsquo;t come to check up on recent stories everyday anymore. Stories like this overwhelm me with a sense of imminent failure. I feel hopeless, and, despite how dire the consequences are, I feel there&rsquo;s little I can do. I&rsquo;m a college student, and any political movement would put my grades (and thus my future) in jeopardy, in exchange for minuscule progress.</p>
<p>Once, years ago, a friend of mine proposed a hypothetical question to me- if I was to learn the exact date of my own death, how would I react? Would I become fearful? Reflective? Daring, now unhindered by the fear of death? My answer was the latter. I thought it would be liberating. But now, as I read and hear about the death of things that matter the most to me, I&rsquo;m crestfallen. I am overwhelmed. If I could give my life to overturn these trends, I would without a minute&rsquo;s hesitation. As Michael Levin put it, I &#8220;wouldn&rsquo;t have to flip a coin.&#8221; <br>
The actual situation is not a virtuous one. Self-interested politicians and race-hustlers do anything to advance their own personal interests at the expense of the genocide of races, cultures, and traditions of others. This is no noble fight; this is barbarism.</p>

		<p>This article uses the statistics produced by National Health Service not the Office of National Statistics. There&rsquo;s no period indicated for which these numbers were drawn and the numbers look suspicious for many reasons.<br>
Even though it&rsquo;s hard to trust the government agency&rsquo;s statistics, ONS data of live births for 2008 show:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly 25% of all births in England and Wales in 2008 were to foreign-born women - another record.&#8221; Note that this percentage doesn&rsquo;t include babies born to first or second generation of immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigrants from Eastern Europe, for example, had 25,000 children.&#8221; <br>
That&rsquo;s less than 3.6% and is way below what the NHS statistics show in the article above.  </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe a mainstream politician actually said that. Perhaps there is hope for the political future of Britain?</p>
<p>Poster 3 (John Bell) - those are some interesting counter-points and I hope you are correct. Of course, this doesn;t eman that nothing should be done about it - a 78%-British Britain still isn&rsquo;t British enough for me - but it is good to know that things probably aren&rsquo;t as bad as they seem (even improving, perhaps).</p>
<p>Poster 17 (John) - I feel like you do sometimes. But it seems as if things are on the &#8220;up&#8221; lately, as if there is a &#8220;wind of change&#8221; (but this time, a good one) that is about to sweep the western world. When I first became interested in nationalist (or &#8220;racialist&#8221;) politics, I felt nothing but doom, twenty-four-seven. But now, I feel as if there is not only hope, but that we WILL be victorious in the end. That everyone will come to their senses before its too late. I just remember to pray for political parties such as the BNP every Sunday at church, formulate my arguments and opinions, and read up on nationalist websites to keep up-to-date with all the relevent news. And eventually, I will actually tell people how I feel politically (it will be difficult because many of my friends, and even some non-blood relatives, are minorities). Trust me, if we all did those four things, the movement would grow and grow until we would be unstoppable. Our day will come.</p>
