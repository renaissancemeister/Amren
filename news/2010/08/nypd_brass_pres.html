			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Kemp, New York Daily News, August 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two academics at an FBI-sponsored conference Friday will accuse the NYPD of cooking the books to make the city appear safer.</p>
<p>The claims are contained in a survey of more than 309 police officers  &mdash;  most of whom have served as precinct commanders since the department started using the CompStat program in the mid-&rsquo;90s.</p>
<p>More than half of the respondents admitted to fudging numbers, according to the study by John Eterno of Molloy College and Eli Silverman of John Jay College.</p>
<p>The pair of criminologists will also release recordings they obtained from several roll calls that they say capture supervisors telling officers not to take reports of robberies unless the victim is willing to go to the stationhouse.</p>
<p>The recordings also capture officers being told not to take reports if they think the district attorney will not prosecute.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Silverman and Eterno, a retired NYPD captain, will present their findings at the Crime Data Conference at John Jay&rsquo;s West Side campus on 10th Ave.<br>

		<p>Same thing here in the Village Voice.  A cop recorded efforts of co-workers and supervisor&rsquo;s attempts to reduce or not take crime reports in ghetto areas.</p>
<p>http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-04/news/the-nypd-tapes-inside-bed-stuy-s-81st-precinct/1/</p>
<p>From the aricle</p>
<blockquote>During a September 12, 2009, roll call, a fellow cop tells Schoolcraft: &#8220;A lot of 61s &mdash; if it&rsquo;s a robbery, they&rsquo;ll make it a petty larceny. I saw a 61, at T/P/O [time and place of occurrence], a civilian punched in the face, menaced with a gun, and his wallet was removed, and they wrote &#8216;lost property.&rsquo; &#8221;
<p>The practice of downgrading crimes has been the NYPD&rsquo;s scandal-in-waiting for years. The NYPD claims that downgrading happens only rarely, but in the course of reporting this story, the Voice was told anecdotally of burglaries rejected if the victim didn&rsquo;t have receipts for the items stolen; of felony thefts turned into misdemeanor thefts by lowballing the value of the property; of robberies turned into assaults; of assaults turned into harassments.</p>
<p>How widespread that kind of thing was in the 81st Precinct is unclear just from the recordings, but Schoolcraft claims it was common. Of course, caution in taking a complaint is prudent. But the fact that the precinct commander discourages the taking of robbery complaints has to influence other decisions down the chain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among many other incidents Schoolcraft discussed were:</p>
<p>* A man walked in to report that he was choked unconscious and robbed of his wallet. He left with a slip that would allow him to renew his driver&rsquo;s license. Then, a detective came down and said, &#8220;If that guy comes back, don&rsquo;t let him upstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>* Another downgraded robbery from October 23, 2008: Two officers responded to a robbery and found a guy beaten up and bleeding. A lieutenant responded to the scene and said, &#8220;We can&rsquo;t take this robbery.&#8221; It came in as a lost property.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are you kidding, it&rsquo;s not a &#8216;crime&rsquo; if a white person is the victim. It is a misunderstanding. And unless all your ducks are in order at the time of the misunderstand, how do the police know You are not the actual (hate) criminal? In fact, your entire post evidences a glaring lack of sensitivity and the outburst needs to be reported to the proper authories!  </p>

		<p>Black irresponsibility.  According to black people if you hold them accountable for their actions you are racist.  Here we have entire police departments ignoring certain crimes that black people heavily do so not to be called racist or have a black person sue them.  Black irresponsibility is one of the major themes in black life.  We are seeing the fruition of black people&rsquo;s efforts to tear down the American justice system to accommodate their lifestyle.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid poster #6 is right.  Think of how the newspapers hide the race of criminals when the perps are black.  It&rsquo;s like a vast conspiracy or something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say that if I were a cop in a major urban area (since they&rsquo;re all pretty much non-white now in a dramatice less than 20 year process) I would not even venture out on the beat.  I would sit in my patrol car at a donut shop and read a book or drive around on well-lit streets in busy areas.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go down dark alleys or in the heart of the voodoo boondocks.  If I get a call for a crime, I&rsquo;ll wait a half an hour and show up later when the shootings have stopped.  If I go in charging to the rescue, the liklihood of charges of racism and police brutality become astronomical.  It ain&rsquo;t worth it!</p>

		<p>Each and every time I hear/read of plummeting urban crime rates and the like, I am immediately suspicious of some kind of &#8220;fuzzy math&#8221; and funny business being applied. While there are surely dips and such for a variety of reasons(increased policing, higher incarceration rates, etc.), crime just doesn&rsquo;t magically abate in areas where &#8220;you know who&#8221; reside in quantity - this is an iron law!! </p>

		<p>This makes perfect sense - Hispanics won&rsquo;t report crime due to most of them being here illegally and not wanting to be deported. Blacks won&rsquo;t report crime as that would be snitching.  Asians report crime, but only to the local mafia boss who then takes the appropriate action, and Whites don&rsquo;t report crimes as they have all left for safer areas. Hence, a lower -reported- crime rate.</p>

		<p>I have been suspicious of the reduced crime rates being reported in metropolitan areas for years.  There is no reason they should be occurring, yet they have been.  So now we find the &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; (pun fully intended) with the police cooking the books to satisfy the PC politicians.</p>
<p>These actions graphically illustrate the corrupting influence throughout society of the mandated objective of &#8220;racial equality&#8221; regardless of the consequences.  In this instance it compromised the civic responsibility of public servants resulting in less safety for the general public.</p>

		<p><b>&#8220;The practice of downgrading crimes has been the NYPD&rsquo;s scandal-in-waiting for years.&#8221; </b></p>
<p>While this is absolutely true, it has not been &#8220;in waiting&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s been going on for a long time. I mean a LONG time.   Every few years, the press makes this same &#8220;discovery&#8221;  again. </p>
<p>Precinct commanders are promoted on the basis of how they have reduced crime, their number of brutailty complaits, EEO complaints,  sexual harassment complaints, etc.,  and politicians [who control the promotions] are extremely sensitive to such statistics.  Some commanders will do virtually anything to  try to make themselves look good and get that coveted promotion up above captain. That is a purely political appointment.</p>
<p>This  manipulation of stats was raised to an art in the 90&rsquo;s under Mayor Giuliani.  Numbers were all the obsession.   The very intensive CompStat sessions became a way of pressuring and  virtually terrorizing commanders to lower their crime rates  (or at least the statistics), any way they could; and they got the message, if they knew what was good for them.</p>
<p>I can pretty well asure you that commanders are not that concerned with hiding racial statistics (although the politicians may be). What they are really doing is bolstering their chances for promotion by making their precincts  and Boro commands look good.</p>
<p>This periodic discovery is nothing new. Not new, but true. </p>

		<p>when I moved to NYC in &#8216;91 (during the crack epidemic &amp; the notoriously incompetent Dinkins maoralty), there were ca 2400 (!!) homicides annually, ca 92% committed by blacks (ca 25 % of the pop.).</p>
<p>The cops cannot simply &#8220;downgrade&#8221; 2000 homicides to falls in bathtubs, so crime in NYC really is a fraction of what it was then. </p>
<p>They are exaggerating their success, and that is a crime, plain and simple.</p>
<p>But there is just no comparison between NY today &amp; the malestrom of chaos and violence that was NYC in the early 90s.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s like a vast conspiracy or something&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s all that vast. These policies are set by a handful of people at a high level and everybody else goes along to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>Police departments are hierarchical organizations. So are newspapers and television networks. It&rsquo;s easy for one or two people at the top to control everything that happens below them.</p>
<p>Memos are circulated to middle management which passes the word down to the lower levels. Everybody does what they&rsquo;re told. It&rsquo;s a condition of their employment. They may not like it. They may not believe in the new policies or laws or whatever, but they go along and keep their mouths shut. After a while, the smarter ones start to game the system.</p>
<p>This is a form of deep corruption, if you think about it. Ramsay McMullen, the great Roman historian, wrote a book called &#8220;Corruption and the Decline of Rome&#8221; in which he argued that this kind of corruption weakened the Western Empire so much that it was no longer able to defend its borders from the barbarian incursions. Roman officials at all levels were so preoccupied with advancement and working the system and looking out for their own interests that no one was looking out for the overall interests of the state and the Roman people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry to say that if I were a cop in a major urban area (since they&rsquo;re all pretty much non-white now in a dramatic less than 20 year process) I would not even venture out on the beat. I would sit in my patrol car at a donut shop and read a book or drive around on well-lit streets in busy areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perfectly understandable and rational. It&rsquo;s exactly the kind of thing McMullen was talking about. In your example, if enough cops were doing the same thing, it would lead to a steady rise of street crime in your area and eventually a complete breakdown in order. McMullen&rsquo;s thesis was that this same kind of thing had spread through the Roman Empire to such an extent that it caused a general weakening of frontier security that led to total disaster. </p>
<p>The same thing is happening all over the United States. The corruption starts at the top with a few people, usually political types pushing bad policies that work to their own personal advantage, and it spreads through the entire system. Society fragments into millions of individuals doing what they can to survive, get ahead, hang onto what they have. Nobody believes in the system any more, but they have to keep quiet and after a while, the whole thing just collapses.</p>

		<p>In some ways, it may be called &#8216;crime management&rsquo; as a kind of standin for abusive enforcement or intrusive investigation.</p>
<p>For instance, the mass issuance of traffic tickets and constantly sweep and clear operations on given corners as well as friskings probably -does- inhibit some crime.</p>
<p>But the refusal to act on specific instances of noteworthy crime like the guy who got beat up and even sent in a report noting what had happened is beneath contempt.</p>
<p>Particularly when you realize that disassociating yourself from upstanding citizen A while doing constant intimidation work on street walker citizen B is going to get both sides of the race issue hopping mad.</p>
<p>One could almost say that this was a setup for that very type of event.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also sad what happened to the Officer in question who is now shown with a cane.  Getting tossed into a mental ward in Queens after a browbeating by a dozen superior officers is something you expect from medieval justice.</p>
<p>That Schoolcraft tried to keep things internal before he was illegally incarcertated (as well as the detail to which he went in proving his allegations before the QAD) before giving these tapes to &#8216;The Voice&rsquo; argues sympathetically for his sanity never having been in question.</p>
<p>And yet the fact that he ended up hiding in upstate New York shows that the system of coverup has successfully ousted a useful watchdog.</p>
<p>But the very lengths gone to to suppress him indicate that this is more than bureaucratic stat fixing, those engaged have lost the &#8216;for the good of all&rsquo; mentality which allowed them to exceed the criminal threshold in treating one of their own as an enemy.</p>
<p>If this is proven true _by an outside special investigator set up by the Governor or even Federal AG_, I hope Maurelio and his gang of stormtroopers end up incarcerated for a long time and/or unable to work in law enforcement -ever- again.</p>

Likewise, the MSM does everything in their power to hide race in crime reports.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t commit crime at disproportionately higher rates. Only a racist would believe that.</p>
<p>And even if they did, it&rsquo;s only because of how whites have treated them.<br>

<p>Brilliant commentary!  Let me compliment &#8220;Anonymous&#8221;, who has summed up the situation with incredible astuteness.  That is exactly how it is.</p>
<p>In the police, the military, and just about everywhere else, &#8220;going with the flow&#8221; is a condition of employment. Authority is not challenged. People keep their mouths shut and go along. They have no choice. They play the game because they have to. They look the other way and don&rsquo;t see what they shouldn&rsquo;t see.</p>

		<p>There is a lot of pressure to reduce reported crime stats to justify various &#8220;tough&#8221; law and order policies, such as three strikes, the war on drugs, and the massive explosion of the prison-industrial complex. Too much crime and people start getting concerned and thus arm themselves or resort to vigilantism, thereby undermining the state&rsquo;s monopoly of power. </p>
<p>The possible truth is that entirely different means than &#8220;law and order&#8221; might be needed to actually suppress crime. And if we want to tie in the race realist angle, it just may be that with the explosion of illegal immigration and minority underclass populations, crime might be an endemic behavior in the emerging American demographics, regardless of the number of people jailed. </p>

		<p>This has been going on for twenty-plus years in EVERY large city with high crime rates and large minority populations (Is there any disctiction between the two?) The Clinton Justice Department offered instructions to cities on how to do this, then took credit for lower crime rates.</p>
<p>Ask any honest police officer in such a city. When the &#8220;Comstat&#8221; wave struck, many cities offered bonuses to police captains that could show lowered crime rates in their dictricts. guess what happened?  Car Thefts became misdeameanor &#8220;Unauthorized Uses of Property&#8221;, Sexual Assaults became &#8220;Simple Battery&#8221;. When people are shot, and die a day later, it is not a murder because you did not die the same day. </p>

		<p>#5.- How very true. Having worked for and retired from one of the largest sheriff&rsquo;s depts. in the s.e. U.S., I&rsquo;ve seen and experienced this statistical crime skewing firsthand. It is country wide, but they try to keep it as hidden as they can. The FBI even investigated my former agency - but of course the upper echelon were not prosecuted. They hung it on one lone deputy. But the true falsifying and down playing of the crime statistics occured 15 years earlier when the sheriff changed the crime reporting forms, (probably now computer generated), that get sent to this state&rsquo;s crime bureau. This is how all crime in the U.S. is reported - it flows from each L.E. agency to the State L.E. agency then on to the FBI. This was NEVER investigated or mentioned. I have a sneaking suspicion this was ordered from the federal level and if not complied with, federal funding to our agency would have been cut. Our government, with threats to withhold funding, has done more damage to this country than our enemies ever could.  </p>

<p><br>
Indeed it is.  That&rsquo;s how it is in  governmental bureaucracies that are answerable only to themselves, and which even  reserve the right to investigate themselves.  And it&rsquo;s  not just crime statistics, but ALL statistics. They tell the public only what they want the public to know. </p>
<p>Some 20 years ago I found myself in a position where I supervised the office that reported  the deployment of police personnel. In other words, the number of officers assigned to street patrol, desk duty, and so forth.  (This was at a time when there was a great  hullabaloo in the press about too many officers hiding indoors and insufficient cops on patrol.)   Seeing these glaringly wrong figures on our official report, I asked the clerk who prepared the report how she came up with these ridiculous numbers.  She told me she gets them from headquarters.   What???  She said she has to call headquarters, and then they tell her what figures to send them.  This sounded crazy!  She couldn&rsquo;t possibly be right,but she insisted.  I thought she must be stupid. How could they tell her, in advance, what figures to report back to them?   So I called HQ myself  and asked someone in charge.  I was told, basically, that this is the way it&rsquo;s done and to mind my own business and leave well enough alone.   So she was right!  She writes down  the figures that they tell her to give them;  then she sends the same figures back to them in her report.  This is why the whole system is a mess, and the figures that are being reported are pure fantasy.  Everyone is  playing politics and practicing what&rsquo;s called CYA, and the unwritten rule is don&rsquo;t rock the boat.</p>
<p>On another occasion, also long ago, my own superior told me about a complex statistical report that he was assigned to prepare on a moment&rsquo;s notice. He went to the Commanding Officer and complained  that he could not possibly have this report ready by tomorrow, that it would take him days to compile all these figures and do it properly.  He asked what was he supposed to do.   The CO looked him in the eye and  replied with one word:  &#8220;Lie&#8221;.    And so he did.  That CO later advanced to the position of Chief.  Moral: it pays to lie, if you want to get ahead.</p>

		<p>Yes fudging crime states is the sign of a third world country. I got into a debate on another forum with a poster that claimed 10 black countries had LOWER crime rates than most 1st world nations.</p>
<p>Their crime rates do indeed appear much lower until you look at the murder stats. Murder is the one crime most likely to be reported correct everywhere, so that is the gold standard for guaging the true level of crime.</p>

		<p>When the authorities try to cover their butts with a lie, it&rsquo;s called &#8220;fudging.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we do it it it&rsquo;s called &#8220;lying to the authorities,&#8221; and is punishable by  possible jail time.  Just ask Martha Stuart.</p>
<p>The police and justice system are so numerous and over-funded in this country they &#8220;make-work&#8221; by bringing frivolous charges and frivolous arrests.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons I, one out of probably millions, are glad to see the economy drop precipitously in order to cut back all these bloated, worthless government employees.</p>
<p>We DO need fewer police and court personnel.  We don&rsquo;t really get any protection from the police.  Almost everything they&rsquo;re involved in is after the fact activity anyway.  And the court system is an absolute farce, rife with miscreants throughout the system.</p>
<p>I wish they would all get out of our way and let us handle law and order ourselves.  The people&rsquo;s justice is the only kind that is really fair.</p>

		<p>Has anyone ever asked the following question. If crime is going down all over the US, why does every Podunk city suddenly feel that it needs a SWAT team when something that requires SWAT is a once in a 50 year event? </p>
