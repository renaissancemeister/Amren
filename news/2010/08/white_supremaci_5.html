<h1>&#8216;White Supremacist&rsquo; Puts a Genteel Face on Racism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Brean, National Post (Toronto), August 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Paul Fromm&rsquo;s efforts to rouse public opinion against the Tamil migrant ship began last month from his home in Ontario, with impassioned messages posted to Stormfront.org, the Florida-based neo-Nazi website of which he is a &#8220;sustaining member&#8221; and radio host.</p>
<p>It continued last week in Calgary, when he led a group of Aryan Guard skinheads to Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney&rsquo;s constituency office, and so terrified the receptionist that she locked the door and would not accept Mr. Fromm&rsquo;s delivery of a letter until police arrived.</p>
<p>But for Canada&rsquo;s best known racist agitator, things did not really get going until he reached the Pacific shore at Esquimalt, B.C., on Saturday, where the boat was docked.</p>
<p>There, accompanied by Doug Christie  &mdash;  famous as the go-to civil liberties lawyer for every top Canadian racist of the last 30 years  &mdash;  Mr. Fromm got himself front and centre on the national weekend news, flanked by his small group of two dozen protesters.</p>
<p>Mr. Fromm, whose license to teach high school in Ontario was revoked in 2007 for his activism against non-white immigration and ties to groups like the defunct neo-Nazi Heritage Front, appeared in reports by three major news outlets, identified only as the leader of a group called &#8220;Canada First,&#8221; or &#8220;Canada First Immigration Reform Committee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do need immigrants, the public opinion polls show that the majority of Canadians don&rsquo;t want the ethnic balance upset,&#8221; Mr. Fromm said, according to the Toronto Star story.</p>
<p>The media exposure for his message recalls an episode in 2008, when Fox News was criticized by a U.S. anti-hate group, the Southern Poverty Law Center, for allowing Mr. Fromm to appear as a &#8220;free speech activist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fox News is one thing, but to score prominent coverage offering comment on a national refugee crisis to the Toronto Star, Canadian Press, and CTV indicates that Mr. Fromm&rsquo;s nose for media is especially refined.</p>
<p>No outlet responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Fromm said he was &#8220;pleasantly surprised at the amount of press interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did find it unusual,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I took it to mean that some of the journalists have actually gone to journalism school.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Victoria Times-Colonist reported on the protest and identified Mr. Fromm as a &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others are not the first media outlets to be fooled in this way. On the surface, &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; has the same kind of naive appeal as &#8220;historical revisionism,&#8221; a euphemism for Holocaust denial, and a field in which Mr. Fromm is highly regarded as a free speech champion.</p>
<p>Dressed as he was in a suit and tie on a sunny summer&rsquo;s day, Mr. Fromm made an obviously professional spokesman for the media pack. His manner is typical of the public pose struck by other elder statesmen of Canadian racism, such as Don Andrews, a fellow traveller back to university days in Toronto, whose conviction for the wilful promotion of hatred against blacks and Jews was upheld in 1990 at the Supreme Court of Canada. Mr. Andrews has a similar attention-grabbing prank of getting municipal governments across Canada to declare &#8220;European Heritage Week,&#8221; without realizing that the sponsoring organization, his Nationalist Party of Canada, is explicitly white supremacist.</p>
<p>It is a winning strategy, to put a genteel face on racism for the unsuspecting public, as Jared Taylor of American Renaissance discovered in Halifax in 2007, when he challenged an unwitting Black studies professor to debate him on multiculturalism, then basked in media coverage when the professor realized he was an avowed racist, and cancelled.</p>
<p>In the case of the Tamil migrants, all Mr. Fromm had to do to seize the spotlight as a voice of dissent was to gather a few people on a roadside outside of Victoria, B.C., and just start talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way to really do something about people smuggling is to make sure that if you come in through the back door illegitimately like this, you don&rsquo;t get in,&#8221; he said in the CTV report. For balance, his remarks were followed by the more welcoming sentiments of a group of native women from a nearby reserve.</p>
<p>For the modern &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; activist, that is how to play the publicity game  &mdash;  think like the media, get to the scene, and get on camera. And if success if measured by exposure, it is also how to win.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll talk to anybody,&#8221; Mr. Fromm said.</p>

<p>Why do you sound so worried, Mr. Brean? Surely, in the marketplace of ideas, your (implied hard-left Marxist) ideas will sweep away the opposition with the stunning clarity of their truth and logic.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Tamil migrants&#8221;. Read that correctly to mean Tamil Tiger terrorist fighters. Intimidate for decades their fellow Tamil in Canada to making &#8220;contributions&#8221;. Read that correct to mean extortion.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers and illegal aliens. The Canadians are always referred to as NICE PEOPLE! And ARE THAT TOO! Too nice for their own good in this case.</p>
<p>They did say there was not an expected stench on that &#8220;migrant&#8221; ship, so I guess everything is OK.</p>

		<p>The traditional meaning of &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221; before it <br>
it was hijacked by radical leftest to demean White People<br>
whom may just believe that such issues as legal, and illegal<br>
immigrants coming into the country should be controlled, and<br>
that immigration laws should be enforced.<br>
In a multiracial society in which the Whites are on the top.<br>
Every White Employer whom fires his native born Black, and<br>
White employees just because they are paid decent wages, and<br>
replace them with legal, and illegal immigrants because they<br>
are will to work for lower wages, and cash under the table to<br>
avoid taxes, is a true since a &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221;.<br>
The same can be applied to those White Editors, Opinion<br>
Makers, College Professors, and Government Officials,<br>
Religious Clergy whom constantly lie, and demean their fellow White People by ignoring the truth, publish false theories just to promote a globalist agenda, and a fantasy world that will<br>
never exist, except in the sick minds of these true &#8220;White Supremacists.&#8221;<br>

<p>Of course that makes him one.</p>
<p>The MSM loves the term &ldquo;white supremacist,&#8221; and yet the word &#8220;dispossession&#8221; is missing from their vocabulary.</p>
<p>As a result, most people shrink in fear from the word &ldquo;white supremacist,&#8221; but don&rsquo;t even know what the word &#8220;dispossession&#8221; means.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the MSM controls our thoughts.</p>

<p>Of course ANY rational White that stands for his own race and FACTS is labeled by ALL media as a hater. Time to stand up and say, SO WHAT? Who really cares what these types say about us?  We know their evil, hateful agenda against us and we need to stand firm and stand together or we will all fall together.</p>
<p> We will no longer be silenced by those intent on the genocide of the White race. </p>

		<p>This is such a sleazy piece of writing. And to think the National Post is considered a conservative newspaper. It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder for me to pay attention to the main stream media. I keep thinking of the white reporters who got hounded out, or couldn&rsquo;t get hired, or quit in disgust at the hypocrisy. That could&rsquo;ve been me so how can I possible support these news sources. I still want to keep up to date on the news so I try to be aware of the big stories but I don&rsquo;t try to get into the details. There are no reliable sources of opinion or news in the main stream media so I refrain from digging too deeply into the big issues.</p>

		<p>The problem is that that it&rsquo;s a semantic trap made large.  Give the man his 2 minutes and people think, &#8220;Yeah, that makes sense.&#8221;  Then pop the supremacist/racist label and they are smacked in the face, guilted out for feeling sympathetic to a smarmy white guy with a hidden agenda.<br>
Which is of course exactly what the liberals are.<br>
The reality which must be &#8216;connect the dots&rsquo; broached is as follows:<br>
1.  White Supremacy in a garden continent like North America is not wrong.  Anymore than Black Supremacy in a toilet like Africa is wrong.  Or Asian supremacy in a crowded, hellish, backward, hinterland of China is wrong.  We do not have to apologize for good fortune or industriousness.  We have to _preserve it_.  And thus preservationism and Western European are the labels you want to INSIST be used in reference to your cause.  With the same outrage as a black man would respond with being called the N word.</p>
<p>2.  You need to LINK UP with the constituency.  Get a website out there.  Tell them that you have a poll up with a lot of options, none of which have anything to do with N2 or Supremacist agendas and more to do with -value- driven economics, crime and workforce issues.</p>
<p>3.  These poll issues must be progressive.  First you give short summaries and LINKING proofs, even if not all the answers are positive for your side.  Then you give a &#8216;do you agree or not?&rsquo; Then you post solutions which vary in outcomes from turning people back and accepting the denouncement of the world for not &#8216;sharing the wealth&rsquo;.  To acceptance in only local regions of forced arrival.  To wider dissemination of immigrants as, say, temporary workers without public benefits as real citizens.  To the full up naturalization process and likely demographic outcomes &#8216;at present rates&rsquo; of boat-peopling transfer and birth.  Provide cost and benefit analysis for each option.</p>
<p>THEN you collate the options under simple headings from &#8220;NO WAY!&#8221; to &#8220;SEND MORE!&#8221; and start to counter-point the hollow MSM with some solid pollstering of your own.</p>
<p>Always with the objective of &#8220;Don&rsquo;t judge until you see.  We post all the data openly.  Come look at what people LIKE YOU have to say on the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such an approach is the only way to polarize a society around ethnic self preservation beyond the labeling anathematization capability of the media to contain.</p>
<p>And it has to be done smartly.  Without malice.  And with a great deal of attention to the details of how much it will cost.  And how bad the alternative (refusal) could be for the huddled masses yearning to get rich.</p>

		<p>The National Post recently changed hands because the previous owner, a Jewish family from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, ran it into the ground with its one-sided editorial policy.  It was sold by the creditors for amounts owing&hellip;</p>
<p>I used to subscribe to it briefly on a trial basis but could not stomach it, and when phone solicited to continue my subscription I stated that I would not soil the bottom of a bird cage with their rag&hellip; (My wife pleaded with me not to say this).</p>
<p>Anyway,  with luck the new owners will see the light and introduce a more even-handed editorial policy or see their investment dwindle to nothing.  One can only hope.</p>

		<p>compared to the treatment Paul Fromm usually gets from the lame-stream media here, the National Post piece was intelligent and even-handed. <br>
Mr Fromm is a genius on this topic &hellip; he&rsquo;s still standing after 30 years at it &hellip; having learned that politics is not much different than the circus bizness, particularly,  what old PT Barnum knew &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care what you say about me, just spell my name right&#8221;</p>

<p>Distrust in the &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; is now at record lows.  Good.  People are waking up.  For years the MSM has been telling us that fearing our dispossession, not wanting to be reduced to a minority in our own countries, not wanting to eventually go flat out extinct, is white supremacism.  Recognizing the reality of intrinsic racial differences is also of course labeled white supremacism, as is opposition to discrimination against whites.  So it&rsquo;s comforting to think that at least the MSM will go extinct before white people do. </p>
