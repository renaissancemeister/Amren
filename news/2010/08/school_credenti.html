<h1>School Credentials Team to Scrutinize Wake</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>T. Keung Hui and Thomas Goldsmith, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A powerful accreditation group is threatening to strip its credentials from Wake County&rsquo;s high schools unless the school board majority can justify all the major decisions they&rsquo;ve made since December.</p>
<p>The sweeping review that will be conducted in early fall by Advancing Excellence in Education Worldwide, or AdvancED was triggered by a March complaint filed by the state NAACP and is one of less than a handful conducted each year by the accreditation group based in suburban Atlanta.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rare, and it is serious,&#8221; Mark Elgart, CEO of AdvancEd, said of the pending review of North Carolina&rsquo;s largest school district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The AdvancED review team, scheduled to spend three days in Raleigh in September or October, is charged with determining whether the school board is making decisions based on the best interests of students and the community and whetherthe board is following its own policies, Elgart said.. If the answers don&rsquo;t satisfy the team, Wake&rsquo;s 24 high schools could lose the accreditation that makes it easier for students to get scholarships, loans and college acceptances.</p>
<p>The decision to scrutinize Wake school board actions follows months of protests, rallies and arrests since a new majority took control of the board in December and immediately began dismantling the district&rsquo;s longstanding economic diversity policy in favor of community schools. The Rev. William Barber, head of the state civil rights organization, has been at the forefront of those protests and rallies and has twice been arrested during school board meetings.</p>
<p>AdvancED accredits more than 27,000 schools, but only rarely executes the kind of review that Wake is getting. In Georgia, reviews of three districts resulted in one losing its accreditation  &mdash;  the first such action in nearly 40 years  &mdash;  and two others facing sanctions. In two of those Georgia districts, the state&rsquo;s governor removed school board members in the aftermath of the accreditation group&rsquo;s review. No provision exists in North Carolina law that would allow anything similar to happen here.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Roiled by the news</b></p>
<p>The news that AdvancED would put the Wake board&rsquo;s decision-making under a microscope brought angry charges from supporters of the majority that the group was venturing far from educational topics and presenting unnecessary obstacles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tedesco [John Tedesco, a school board member] asked how relevant it is for an accreditation agency to look into legal contracts, school construction decisions and other board policy decisions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another decision to be reviewed is the board majority&rsquo;s vote to name the Civitas Institute, a Raleigh-based conservative organization, as one of the groups that can provide training to board members. Francis DeLuca, president of the Civitas Institute, said the review is going too far beyond educational issues that should be determined by elected board members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School officials urged AdvancED in April to drop the review, calling it &#8220;completely unwarranted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The persons who have made these unfounded complaints are seeking to use your organization in an attempt to defeat the will of the voters of Wake County as reflected in the last election,&#8221; the school district said in its response.</p>
<p>But the school district&rsquo;s response didn&rsquo;t satisfy AdvancED, which now wants detailed information on the qualifications of the people developing the new student assignment plan and any financial and academic studies used to justify abandoning the diversity policy. Some of the issues raised are similar to those brought up by Great Schools in Wake Coalition, a community group that supports the old diversity policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Still the largest system</b></p>
<p>In June, school board members discussed whether to continue their membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which is the regional organization for AdvancED. The board kept the membership after interim Superintendent Donna Hargens lobbied them to stay.</p>
<p>Tedesco said he thinks Wake could pull out of SACS without negatively influencing students&rsquo; college prospects.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re still the 18th largest school system,&#8221; Tedesco said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think colleges make decisions based on a school&rsquo;s accreditation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Stephen Farmer, director of undergraduate admissions at UNC-Chapel Hill, disagreed. Many North Carolina universities recommend that applicants come from accredited high schools, he said. {snip}</p>

		<p>If this school system loses accreditation, it&rsquo;s in trouble. Right or wrong, the diplomas won&rsquo;t mean much. For most of the black students, that doesn&rsquo;t matter, since they aren&rsquo;t going to higher education or graduating from a four year school anyway. But for whatever whites or Asians in this system, or the small minority of dedicated black students who want an education, it&rsquo;s too bad. But school systems that run programs from which everyone graduates because you can sit in a seat for 4 years, ie the majority of US school systems, lack of accreditation is a kiss of death. this is why high schools need to be limited to motivated, literate students. The rest should be taught trades, and if they refuse to do so, forced labor camps with 1000 calorie a day diets in norther Alaska or North Dakota might stir some motivation. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of &#8216;Advancing Excellence in Education Worldwide, or AdvancED&rsquo; accreditation but this doesn&rsquo;t sound like an accreditation process so much as it sounds like arm-twisting and extortion.</p>
<p>Wake County should be screaming extortion and calling them out. Do they really need this accreditation?</p>
<p>Wake County should give up the accreditation and then focus on raising standards. They could develop their own reputation of excellence and make AdvancED irrelevant.<br>

		<p>The Wake board can fight this successfully, but they will have to enlist their state legislators in the struggle, and it will probably take a while.  The school accrediting agencies have become the 800 pound weight of &#8220;diversity enforcement&#8221; (i.e.,race mixing) as local school boards and even the federal courts have stepped back from insisting that diversity (formally known as integration) trumps everything else, including academic achievement and the physical safety of the students.  These private organizations have great power but can be effectively challenged by the power of the state, IF the legislature and governor will act together to defend the school board&rsquo;s prerogatives. They will also have to be willing to be aggressive, and make it clear to AdvancED that they themselves could suffer serious consequences. (Such as the withdrawal by many states, not just NC, from the organization.)  Unfortunately, this will take some courage, grit and staying power on the part of government officials and school board members alike.  Let&rsquo;s hope they have enough. </p>

		<p>I hope Wake County loses this one. If all the people in Cary and Apex love Obama so much, I&rsquo;m sure they would be more than happy to have Jamal and LaShawana in school with their kids. The only ones who don&rsquo;t deserve it are the people in Holly Springs.</p>

		<p>Not graduating from an accredited high school (or any high school for that matter) is not a barrier to attending college.  One of my brothers, my sister, and I all started college at age 17 without &#8220;graduating&#8221; and our other brother started at 15.  I didn&rsquo;t even get a GED and earned a full scholarship to a major university.  As I later found out, approximately 1/3 of all national merit finalists don&rsquo;t graduate high school and simply start college.<br>
The problem these kids will face isn&rsquo;t one of accreditation, as millions of home-schooled children can attest, it will be convincing a prospective university that they are sufficiently well educated to handle college level material.<br>
In short, they are in trouble even if their schools remain accredited.<br>
BTW, though 0/4 of my parents children graduated high school, two have doctorates, one&rsquo;s a registered nurse, and one&rsquo;s a master dive instructor.  A high school diploma is useless.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Detroit public schools are accredited?  The student body is something like 95% non-white.  </p>
<p>Most teachers, admins and nearly the entire support staff throughout the district is also non-white - and the graduation and proficiency rates are about as low as you can go without laughing.</p>
<p>What leverage could a national accrediting agency have there to enforce integration, er, I mean &#8216;diversity&rsquo; when the only people to mix together are blacks, latinos and low class asians?  (Oh, they can blackmail the state gov&rsquo;t for mo&rsquo; money!)</p>
<p>Why is mixing many different groups of non-whites together not good enough to satisfy &#8216;diversity&rsquo; requirements?</p>
<p>I send my kids to a $15,000 a year private school (ouch my budget is in the dumps) just to spare them from the joys of diversity.  </p>
<p>I know it is wrong of me to deprive my kids of the &#8216;enrichment&rsquo; that Dequan and Shaquanda can provide, but I guess I need to attend me some mo&rsquo; &#8216;diversity is good&rsquo; seminars.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure everyone agrees this has nothing to do with academic accreditation and everything to do with an NGO forcing it&rsquo;s socio-political views on the people of Wake County. The people of Wake County elected the school board NOT AdvancED. So AdvancEd has no business meddling in policy. AdvancED should limit themselves to whether or not the academic standards are being met.</p>
<p>If I lived there (and I don&rsquo;t) I&rsquo;d tell AdvancED to stick it. The kids are better off in a good school without accreditation than a bad school with it. The problem is that not everyone will agree. And the fallout from losing accreditation may cost some school board members their seats the next time around. Not that I consider that a big deal. But if the next crop of school board members reverses the policies then nothing will have been accomplished. </p>
<p>There is no way around it   &mdash;   Wake County has to get some smart people involved to figure this one out. Is there an alternative accreditation? Can they sue AdvancED?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had to provide copies of my college transcripts and copies of my college diploma and law school diploma to get a job, but no one has ever wanted me to &#8220;prove&#8221; that I graduated from an accredited high school.  You just write the name of your high school in the blank on the job application, and that does the trick.</p>
<p>If you are applying for a job that only requires a high school diploma, there is little likelihood that anyone will actually verify the fact that you graduated, much less inquire into the academic rigor of the curriculum.  </p>
<p>The parochial school that my children attended decided to spend the money to get accredited because the local high schools were threatening to make the kids take classes over again if they transferred.  What a joke   &mdash;   the parochial school had far higher standards than the public schools in the area.</p>

		<p>Accrediting agencies are nothing more than a mutual scratching of backs.  Schools, hospitals, etc. pay the agency to &#8220;accredit&#8221; them, and the agency does.  It supposedly looks impressive to the public.<br>
Most white people in majority-black districts send their kids to private schools, even if they have to scrimp mightily to do it.  Unfortunately, there are a few children of the poor and of fuzzy-headed liberals who don&rsquo;t.  These youngsters are almost all doomed to fall into the perils of the hip-hop culture.  No white person should ever subject his child to this.  Poor people who can should move to a white area, send the kids to live with relatives, or do whatever it takes.</p>

		<p>So, the purpose of schools is not teaching English, math, and science, and - accordingly - the accreditation process is not supposed to verify it.</p>
<p>Guess what, it works. Many our students are embarrassingly deficient in all three.</p>
<p>They are politically indoctrinated (to the left) alright, though. What I cannot understand is why the voters keep re-electing &#8220;Liberals&#8221; that subjected their (voters&rsquo;) kids to forced indoctrination in place of actual education? In a free country like America it should be a felony to do such a thing to children in schools.<br>

		<p>   I have wondered for a long time why we can no longer have neighborhood schools . What could possibly make more sense ? It would minimize busing, be easier to budget and downsize the delinquent population thereby denying them the influence they exert on the rest of the students . In my opinion, consolidation always works on paper but seldom works in practice . I see people in the paper complaining all the time about our expensive, dysfunctional schools . I say,&#8221; go back to when the schools were not broken and build on that model .&#8221; Of course it will never happen because efficient schools are not what is really desired . The powers that be want politically correct schools that will serve as indoctrination centers for our youth . This article explains it all . This is how the county size enclaves whites are now flocking to in the south will be brought to their knees . The NAACP will simply make sure their schools lose their accreditation . I had wondered how and now I see it clearly . Never under estimate the competition, even if they score lower on aptitude test .  </p>

		<p>This is a great issue to organize around.  AdvanceED and the NAACP are engaged in racial bullying pure and simple.  Not only do their actions perfectly illustrate the corrupt nature of racial politics in the U.S.A., the measures they propose will have direct, negative impact on many white people. (And on some black people, too.)  I say, time for a bit of community organizing!</p>

&#8220;Do blacks ever feel embarrassed that they have to resort to tactics like this to force others to be around them?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered the same thing, but have concluded they are so without shame they&rsquo;ll force any situation no matter how degrading they might have to act in order to prevail.</p>
<p>But, behind it all, I&rsquo;m pretty sure these denser black types stupidly believe that just forcing the inclusion of blacks into all things is enough for them to be regarded as having  parity with whites.  </p>
<p>However, the bottom line is that no matter how much they whine, beg, cry and degrade themselves, their efforts are for naught in the long run. </p>
<p>They want inclusion and equal status with whites by hook or crook.  Not until high profile whites point out that blacks don&rsquo;t have parity with any of the races in the world, not just whites, will this nonsense come to an end.</p>
<p>But, of course, that means never if we wait for white elitist courage to come to the fore.  I mean, who is going to commit career suicide by forcefully informing blacks they can&rsquo;t compete on an equal basis with the other races?</p>
<p>The fact is that blacks in the US, like blacks the whole world over, including Africa, build no factories, no small businesses, compose great music, excel intellectually or write books that are innovative and thought provoking, nor do they accomplish anything else other races do.  </p>
<p>Look at their architecture.  Huts with grass roofs.  Look at their technology.  Spears, bows and arrows and witch doctor&rsquo;s masks, with zero advancements in even basic competent medical care.  The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>And, since they can offer nothing of appreciable accomplishment the worst of them make fanatic attempts to steal the history of other races and force the inclusion of their populations where they are not wanted, because of their propensity for crime and violence, and their lack of ability and intellect.  They would be surprised to know that dancing and singing, jumping and shooting baskets are not regarded as items of an advanced people. </p>
<p>They accomplish nothing and are as incompetent in Africa as they are here.</p>
<p>But as long as this empire continues on, they will have to be cared for, soothed, tolerated and coddled or they will riot, steal and kill to get what they want and make themselves victims in the process.</p>
<p>The good news is, however, that this empire is in the process of ending RIGHT NOW&hellip;.in a BIG WAY.  &#8220;Gimme&#8221; time is coming to an end.</p>
