<h1><a href="http://www.annarbor.com/news/dicken-investigation-report-released/">Dicken Principal Mike Madison Will Not Be Disciplined for Black-Only Field Trip, Report Indicates</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Jesse, annarbor.com, August 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ann Arbor elementary school Principal Mike Madison will not be disciplined for starting a Lunch Bunch study group open only to black students, despite repeated findings that the group broke district policy and state law.</p>
<p>Those were among the results of the district&rsquo;s investigation into the group, which sparked controversy after Madison took more than 30 black students on a field trip this spring and left non-black students behind. The three-page investigative report was obtained by AnnArbor.com on Monday through the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Madison&rsquo;s desire to address the achievement gap at Dicken School is commended; the manner in which he went about doing so with respect to configuring the lunch group and subsequent field trip was not appropriate,&#8221; Lee Ann Dickinson-Kelley, the district&rsquo;s administrator for elementary education, wrote in the memo. &#8220;Such decision-making was not responsible and should not be repeated. &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The incident</b></p>
<p>On April 28, a group of 30 black Dicken students went on a field trip to visit University of Michigan scientist Alec Gallimore.</p>
<p>The students who went on the trip were members of the Lunch Bunch, which started in January and was open to black students in grades three through five.</p>
<p>When the students got back to school following their field trip, they joined their classmates in a vocal music class. When they entered, they were greeted by booing.</p>
<p>Madison, who is black, came to teacher Ken Monash&rsquo;s fifth-grade class the next day to discuss the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Madison reprimanded the students in Mr. Monash&rsquo;s fifth-grade classroom the following day for the booing behavior,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;A discussion followed between Mr. Madison and the fifth grade students regarding racial bias and societal injustice, Mr. Madison&rsquo;s personal experiences of racial profiling, and discriminatory behaviors such as booing. Students became upset and reported these events/discussion to their parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly what was said in the class is a big part of the controversy that erupted among parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is some question whether the booing was the manifestation of student envy, racial bias towards the African American students who participated in the field trip, concern by the students that the music class was again crowded with the increased number of students returning from the trips and/or because this class has in the past &#8216;booed&rsquo; as a demonstration of displeasure,&#8221; Dickinson Kelley wrote. &#8220;Regardless, the students interpreted the booing behavior and Mr. Madison as a slight towards African American students by their Caucasian peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Madison engaged the students in what he characterized as a &#8216;courageous&rsquo; conversation about race and racial profiling. This exchange caused some students to become upset with other students while others felt the conversation was personally accusatory. Mr. Madison&rsquo;s tone was described as passionate and intense by some and as yelling by others. Some students became clearly upset  &mdash;  crying  &mdash;  and felt singled out. Mr. Madison sought out the school psychologist following the conversation to help calm individual classmates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madison also took one student out of the class, into the hallway and ultimately outside the outer school doors to talk to him about the incident.</p>
<p><b>The fallout</b></p>
<p>Following the meeting with Madison and the class, numerous parents expressed concern to Madison and various school district administrators about both his actions in the classroom and the trip.</p>
<p>The story was reported by AnnArbor.com and the picked up by regional and national media, creating intense scrutiny on the district.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the district ended the Lunch Bunch program and held parent meetings at the school.</p>
<p>On May 12, the school board issued a statement saying the program violated state law and the district&rsquo;s own anti-discrimination policy.</p>
<p><b>The investigation&rsquo;s findings</b></p>
<p>Dickinson Kelley was critical of Madison&rsquo;s actions in several instances in the report, but also said repeatedly that his intent was good.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Madison knowingly and intentionally violated the District&rsquo;s Non discrimination Policy #2050 and Article I, Section 26 of the State Constitution, his actions did indeed do so,&#8221; she wrote. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8221;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. principals as educational leaders are expected to lead by example; at no time should any teacher or principal engage students in an extended conversation by yelling or with an intimidating tone. Furthermore, while discussions about culture and race can be very healthy and lead to a greater sense of understanding and tolerance, the students in Mr. Monash&rsquo;s classroom were unprepared for such an intense and intensely personal conversation given the context of the &#8216;field trip&rsquo; events. Mr. Madison should have used better professional judgment and engaged in a developmentally appropriate conversation with the fifth grade students without the context of anger and personal references.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report also criticized Madison&rsquo;s poor judgment for taking the student outside the outer school doors instead using a closed classroom to continue the discussion, which &#8220;caused the student and student&rsquo;s parents grave concern.&#8221; According to the report, upon hindsight, Madison agreed he should have taken the student to his office instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;In closing, it is expected that Mr. Madison appreciate the degree to which his actions exposed the school district to potential illegalities, diverted precious district resources  &mdash;  personnel and community goodwill  &mdash;  during the last critical month of the school year, exposed the school district to local, national and international criticism, focused undeserved scrutiny of the Pacific Group&rsquo;s Educational Program, and impacted Dicken School families, staff and students,&rsquo;&#8221; the report says. &#8220;It is expected that no such actions or lack of judgment will occur again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And while racial injustice remains a pernicious and nefarious assault on our society, a condition that impacts the lives of students every day, the degree to which we directly involve our youngest students in these conversations must be done with regard for developmental readiness and with great care.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Lee Ann Dickinson-Kelley would lead us to believe that a black school principal was unaware that creating a lunch group for black students only was in violation of the district&rsquo;s non-discrimination policy.</p>
<p>I find that impossible to believe, but even if it&rsquo;s true it proves the man a complete moron and unfit to be in charge of an educational establishment.  </p>
<p>Yeah he didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;.more like he didn&rsquo;t care.  He would have known where he stood on a Lunch Bunch that only took white kids on field trips, of that much you can be sure.</p>
<p>And of course any white principal that bungled something like this so badly would have been out of a job and blacklisted.  If you&rsquo;re a pervert you can just find work in another district because they don&rsquo;t check, but I&rsquo;m sure the names of &#8220;racists&#8221; circulate like wild fire.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a bit surprised at this result. However, had this guy been fired, the result I&rsquo;m sure would have been much worse with cries of racism despite the fact he was being lightly accused of the same thing.  We all know had this been a white principal with white students involved, the guy would have been tarred and feathered, lost his job and his life utterly destroyed. This guy gets a slap on the wrist. Disgusting.</p>

		<p>The non-black students knew that the black students had just gotten preferential treatment in way of a field trip and voiced their frustration at the unfairness.  Kids aren&rsquo;t naive about things like this, they can see when they are given the shaft.  The black supremist principle then raged against white racism to the white kids that had just been screwed over.  The white kids in this class will forever remember that being black gives you advantages from black authority.  The white kids have learned a lesson that most don&rsquo;t get until later in life.  They have first hand experience of the hypocrisy of black supremists and their liberal apologists who find &#8220;white priviledge&#8221; to be the scorn of humanity but celebrate when blacks engage in real favoritism.  </p>

<p>He took the conscious action to discriminate but he didn&rsquo;t knowingly or intentionally violate school policy on discrimination.</p>
<p>How many people reading this believe that excuse would be acceptable if the mistaken individual was white?</p>
<p>Once again we see that we MUST lower standards for blacks regardless their positions because they amount to little more than ignorant, helpless children who don&rsquo;t know any better and can therefore get away with anything because that&rsquo;s just how they are.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine the reaction if the principal and the students were white? There would have been no need to have an investigation. The principal would have been fired immediately. The school district would have been under siege by Al Sharpton. The law suits would have come crashing down. There might actually have not been a need for some of this reaction because most of the blacks would no longer be attending the school, their heads, and the heads of black members of the community would have exploded. Talk about an obvious double standard. How about a white teacher organizing a group of students and telling blacks that he doesn&rsquo;t see the problem. The &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is a black problem, not a white problem. And tell the black students about his personal experiences with poorly performing blacks. Not likely. </p>

		<p>&#8220;His behavior merely &ldquo;should not be repeated.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Except when applying for college or a new job or when joining an activist group at school or at college or on the job, and when writing a paper for school, or even when going home after school, because when doing all those things racial separation and racial segregation is nearly mandatory. </p>

		<p>The silver lining to this and many other similar incidents that have happened recently involving white students being slighted in favor of nonwhites is that it&rsquo;s waking up young white people to the presence of reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>Many whites I know are cynical about the future and this is a powerful force to be reckoned with when it takes on more speed.  I have been the victim of reverse discrimination on many occassions in the last five years, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>Some would argue that it&rsquo;s &#8216;just desserts&rsquo; and that whites need &#8216;to feel how others feel&rsquo; who have been (or felt they were) discriminated against.  </p>
<p>The problem with that logic is that neither I nor anyone I know has ever personally discriminated against &#8216;a person of color&rsquo; and if you want to punish me for the sins of someone else just on the basis of association by skin color, then you are engaging in &#8216;collective punishment&rsquo; and racism yourself.  </p>
<p>What other response would you expect in return except for me to start discriminating against nonwhites whenever possible?  Then your ultimate objectives would be further down the tubes as society gets further polarized.  </p>
<p>Justice Roberts said it best: &#8220;The only way to end discrimination by race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.&#8221;  Or something to that effect. </p>

		<p>The fact that this whole race discrimination scheme is a one-way street is becoming so blindingly obvious, even the most completely deracinated among us are beginning to see the light - at least a little bit. One cannot help but see it at this rate, as the lefties and non-whites themselves, no longer even pretend that these laws, rules and policies apply to them as they would to whites. </p>

		<p>This can be a very fine learning experience for European American (White) children and their parents.  Lee Ann Dickinson-Kelley, as elementary coordinator, appears to just want the matter to get in the &ldquo;rear view mirror&rdquo; as soon as possible.  The White parents really need to keep this going with letters to the school, some press letters to the editor, PTA, one-on-one meetings with district administrators, etc. (if nothing else, to keep life rotten for Mr. Mike Madison and Ms. Dickinson-Kelley). <br>
 <br>
Questions like those reflected below should be asked (put in writing) of the Ann Arbor School District&rsquo;s upper administration and, especially, Ms. Dickinson-Kelley:</p>
<p>Do you think Mr. Madison is a rational human being or will he physically and mentally hurt White children?<br>
Can I transfer my White child to another school?<br>
What positive situation will be done for the White children minus the Black children and when?<br>
Has this situation been fair to the White children?<br>
If my child should need to be disciplined, I do not want Mr. Madison involved.<br>
I do not want my child behind closed doors with Mr. Madison.<br>
  <br>
Sadly, this individual (Madison) will, probably, be moved up the ladder within Ann Arbor School District.<br>
