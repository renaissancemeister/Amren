<h1>Feds Agree to Let More Immigrant Workers Into Western Provinces</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Fekete, Calgary Herald, August 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal Conservative government has acquiesced to provincial demands to ease its restrictions on the number of immigrants who can permanently reside in the provinces each year.</p>
<p>The federal government controls the number of permanent immigrants who can settle annually across Canada through the provincial nominee program.</p>
<p>Western provinces have been lobbying the Harper government for months to scrap its plans to impose a lower cap on the number of immigrants arriving through the nominee program.</p>
<p>Rather, the provinces have been urging the Harper government to increase the number of workers they can nominate to the federal government to bring to their jurisdictions to fill permanent jobs.</p>
<p>Federal officials initially indicated in June the provinces wouldn&rsquo;t receive as many nominees as hoped, but announced Tuesday they will increase the numbers, after reviewing their case loads and immigration targets for the year.</p>
<p>The additional nominees are critical to sustaining the short-term economic turnaround as well as long-term growth, explained Alberta Immigration Minister Thomas Lukaszuk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a move in the right direction,&#8221; Lukaszuk said of the federal decision. &#8220;We will be seeing more and more permanent labour shortages. We have to look to immigration towards solving this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advocates say the provincial nominee program is the best solution because immigrants can only apply if they have a guaranteed job that employers have shown cannot be filled by Canadian workers.</p>
<p>The approach ensures new immigrants are paying taxes and contributing to society, rather than tapping strained social assistance programs.</p>
<p>But Alykhan Velshi, director of communications for federal Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, said the federal government has heard the provinces&rsquo; concerns and will increase the numbers beyond what was originally promised earlier this year.</p>
<p>Alberta will now receive 5,000 provincial nominees this year (up from the 4,400 initially approved), which is a large increase from 4,200 last year and 2,800 two years ago.</p>
<p>British Columbia will now receive 3,500 provincial nominees (an increase from the promised 3,200); Saskatchewan has been allocated 4,000 (up from 3,700) and Manitoba will get 5,000 (increased from 4,600 promised).</p>
<p>The provinces were initially promised a smaller number because the federal government is trying to sharply improve processing wait times for immigrants, temporary foreign workers and foreign students.</p>
<p>It also must balance the provincial nominees with the number of immigrants allowed through the Federal Skilled Worker Program, which assesses applicants based on a points system.</p>
<p>Citizenship and Immigration Canada initially set a target of allowing between 240,000 and 265,000 immigrants into the country this year, with the agency usually hitting the midpoint. However, the department now expects to reach the top end of its target, which is helping accommodate more provincial nominees.</p>
<p>Back in Alberta, Lukaszuk noted the 5,000 is just a start and still doesn&rsquo;t address Alberta&rsquo;s long-term economic and immigration needs.</p>
<p>Lukaszuk favours the permanent provincial nominee program over attracting temporary foreign workers  &mdash;  who can often be sent back and forth between Alberta and their home country depending on demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not a big fan of shipping workers in and out, in and out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Social agencies and the food-services industry welcomed the federal government&rsquo;s decision to increase the number of provincial nominees.</p>
<p>Despite the higher unemployment rates in Canada over the past two years, there&rsquo;s still not enough workers to fill jobs in many different sectors, they noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re looking at a problem that is long term,&#8221; said Enayat Aminzadah, director of operations and resource development with Immigrant Services Calgary. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a great way to strengthen our workforce.&#8221;<br>

		<p>One would imagine that the reasons for skilled worker shortages is the fact that the left has utterly destroyed our education system and made it impossible to find work at a decent wage?</p>
<p>Of course the idea that there are &#8220;worker shortages&#8221; is a scam, businesses just want to be able to import third worlders they can pay low as hell, and of course can&rsquo;t quit.</p>

		<p>Lack of good workers.<br>
One of the big lies of our time. Managers seem to be the same stupid as liberals. They think if they have more people, they will have more good workers to be able to decrease the gains and fire &#8220;old&#8221; people at the age of 50 without consequences. But they are doing a big mistake. More immigrant means less good workers: Whites will have to pay for their welfare, they will increase crime rates and whites as always will react by having less babies. Their won&rsquo;t be enough intelligent worker enough and a very lot of sues because of &#8220;discrimination by the white-run companies&#8221;. </p>
<p>Although they have so many analysts, Companies seem not to be able to see, that their business is only going well in white areas.</p>

		<p>Encouraging large families and traditional division of labour means having a smaller economy with few big cities and more small towns because family-oriented cultures tend to save rather than spend money, so making every man &amp; woman an individualistic secular consumer/producer makes for a roaring economy fueled by a materialistic, hypersexual pop-culture - thus the Western elites encourage immigration rather than marriage &amp; more children like in Russia.</p>

<p>Canada DOES NOT have a shortage of workers.  LIke every other country, they have a shortage of jobs, especially low skilled ones.</p>
<p>It is the unscrupulous multiculturalists who are spinning lies about needing labor in order to keep their sick inflow of third world hordes coming in.</p>
<p>They will pay dearly for it.  Like here and in Europe, there are MANY people who are taking names and making notes.</p>

		<p>I live in Alberta and have been kicked to the curb for cheaper labor. Its not a matter of lack of credentials.I am 63 and would like to work another couple of years until my wife retires.What goes on here is a sham of the vilest nature.The Labor Minster just spouts more LABOUR SHORTAGE garbage and brings in 63,000 temporary workers.You cannot believe these people period.There are ample good qualified workers in the energy sector but they want cheap foreign labour.C.N.R.L.has killed two Chinese workers because of this chintzy policy. Its about the Global economy and how to increase profits. When 50%profit is not enough and they seek 2-300 %profit something is fishy in this province.The Governments lie about this just like Jacob the Liar.</p>

		<p>Real estate agents can&rsquo;t fill the demand from risk-averse speculators wanting to invest in safe, multiple-unit rental properties. It&rsquo;s much less risky than equities.</p>
<p>They know the rapid growth of population always results in an under-supply of rental accomodation.</p>
<p>You want to know who is loudly pressuring the government for more immigrants?  It&rsquo;s the speculators who bought land for future development.</p>
<p>This is what they mean by a &#8220;shortage&#8221;.  They want government to fix the market for them.<br>

		<p>Since many foreigners are now in management of both private and government policy, naturally, they wish to benefit their own people any way they can.  I bet that some elected officials are being lobbied pretty relentlessly by foreign governments and entities as well.  Follow the money.</p>
