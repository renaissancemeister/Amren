<h1>$900,000 to Help Right Wrongs Done to Chinese</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Bermingham, The Province (Vancouver), August 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To right historic wrongs done to the Chinese community, the federal government has given the University of B.C. $900,000 to help run a Chinese-Canadian history website.</p>
<p>Alice Wong, Parliamentary Secretary for Multiculturalism, made the announcement Monday at the University&rsquo;s library.</p>
<p>Wong said the government has apologized on behalf of all Canadians for the so-called &#8220;head tax&#8221; the country charged Chinese immigrants to enter Canada between 1885 and 1923  &mdash;  and the near-total ban on Chinese immigration between 1923 and 1947.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a dark chapter in Canada&rsquo;s history,&#8221; said Wong, the Conservative MP for Richmond.</p>
<p>Canada is now spending $5 million on assorted ways to recognize the contribution of Chinese immigrants to their adopted country, she said.</p>
<p>The website, which will be launched in 2012, will feature a digital archive of stories by Chinese-Canadians.</p>
<p>There will also be a way for people to tell their stories online in a multimedia format.</p>
<p>UBC history professor Henry Yu said this year is the 125th anniversary of the laying of the last spike in Canada&rsquo;s national railway  &mdash;  built in part by Chinese labour  &mdash;  and it marks 125 years since the head tax.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese were already here,&#8221; said Yu. &#8220;What we want to do is create a new sense of Canada&rsquo;s past that includes the Chinese.&#8221;</p>
<p>The website is www.chinesecanadian.ubc.ca.<br>

		<p>Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, I&rsquo;m an admirer of China, its ancient culture, it&rsquo;s entrenched traditions, and it&rsquo;s many downright gorgeous women.  But enough of this disgusting (and transparently insincere) apologizing for ancient wrongs (real or imagined) by the white race.</p>
<p>The simple fact is that whites invented all the modern political systems of the world today, the great majority of advanced technology and industrial advances, modern medicine as we know it, and most of the world&rsquo;s great music and literature.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that these accomplishments enabled us to dominate other races, who got into the game a bit later, but for the most part white domination was relatively benign and generous (The White man&rsquo;s burden, don&rsquo;t you know.) We didn&rsquo;t turn the Queen&rsquo;s subjects into slaves, but rather subjects of a far more benign ruling class than they were used to.</p>
<p>So enough of this sickening and historically inaccurate self-flagellation.  On the balance sheet of good and bad, the white race has overwhelming been the greatest benefactor in human history.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I take no pride in being white.  I was born, through no doing of my own, white.  But I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;m going to apologize for being white or for any wrongs the white race has allegedly committed throughout history.</p>

		<p>Canada had every right to control its own immigration policy.</p>
<p>This self-hating apology is a big mistake. There may come a day, when China develops colonies on Alaska, British Columbia, and the American Pacific Northwest. This expression of self-hate only encourages China with any potential colonization.</p>

<p>Great, I hope the first order of business is an apology and a making of amends for the poor treatment of aboriginals and other groups in Canada&rsquo;s past.  </p>

<p>  <br>
I don&rsquo;t believe that white Canadians have ever been allowed to freely immigrate to China, or any Asian country for that matter. Certainly, it is the prerogative of any country to limit immigration to foreigners who most resemble the founding population. Immigration should also not adversely impact the economic welfare of citizens. I see no reason to apologize for past Canadian history.</p>

<p>In fact the vast bulk of Chinese and other Orientals have only been in Canada since the 1960&rsquo;s when the treasonous Liberals let them in.</p>

		<p>Candians have let millions of Chinese into the country in the last twenty years. And now they are supposed to apologise for not letting enough of them in the country between 1885 and 1923.</p>
<p>Yet&hellip;.even today&hellip;It is impossible for a Canadian to immigrate to China.  China has no ever allowed even one Canadian to get Chinese citizenship.</p>

		<p>Side Note:<br>
I talk to people who think that liberal dementia is restricted to the U.S. They have the notion that there are normal countries to which they can emigrate when the U.S. becomes uninhabitable for them. Many think Canada will be a good destination. Costa Rica, Argentina, Ireland, Poland, and other (used to be) Western nations are also mentioned. Thanks to Amren and other sites, I can disillusion them. These &#8220;life raft&#8221; countries are at least as Liberal than the U.S., most of them are worse. </p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m about to say is most liberal, and yet is a compliment to liberals in a sense. There are open minded race realists or whatever, who say liberalism itself is not the problem. That liberalism is something we can be proud of, or that, whether you agree with all of it or not, it is better to live in a liberal and free country. The problem in this case is not liberalism itself, but multiracial societies. So the problem becomes getting liberals themselves involved in tightening the borders. This is a &#8216;paradox&rsquo; of course because as I mentioned, it&rsquo;s very liberal, and in fact modern liberalism itself seems founded on this sort of &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo;, that everything else is simply and offshoot of this mentality - little fish attached to the big fish of &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Know what, &#8220;John&#8221;&hellip; I take GREAT pride in being White, unlike you and all your posts here on Amren. You seem to think it is only the White race that has committed &#8220;atrocities&#8221;? Since you love China so much and it&rsquo;s &#8220;gorgeous women&#8221; (where are they?)<br>
please feel free to leave. Could it be you are married to a Chinese/Asian woman?</p>
<p>As for being born White, it is not just an accidental afterthought by God, it is who we were from day one. WHITE! The same for all the other races. So I will go by God&rsquo;s will and HIS part in who we are for a REASON. </p>

		<p>What absolute rubbish!   The Chinese came to Canada willingly, knowing full well that they would have to pay a head tax.  Even so, they knew they were immigrating to a land where their lives would be a thousand times better than living in China, ruled by warlords and emperors.   Did any of them refuse to pay and return to China?   I doubt it.   Or look at it this way&hellip;if today the United States offered instant American citizenship to any Canadian who paid a $2000. entry fee, there would be an stampede of industrious Canadians to the nearest U.S Immigration Office, all of them anxious to get into a country where hard work and enterprise are rewarded.    But&hellip; would the grandchildren of those new immigrants have the right, decades later, to demand that the $2000. entry fee be paid back to them?   Not in my book.<br>

		<p>Now of course the East Indians also want an apology (and money) for the so-call &#8220;Komagata Maru incident&#8221; of 1914.  Never mind that the people who would give the apology and the people who would receive it were not alive in 1914.  </p>

		<p>Canada has NO obligation to take in Chinese or anyone else. As others have said, China doesn&rsquo;t allow immigration of Whites or Canadians or anyone else. Canada has nothing to apologize for, it has the right as any nation to decide if it wants immigration and if so, how much and from where.</p>

<p>No, they&rsquo;ve always been a vital part of Canada. The Chinese man says so himself. They need to take full responsibility for all the imperial and colonial actions of mother Canada, and be made to wear this guilt in full. </p>

		<p>What a comedy. As if the cynical human rights abusers who are the Chinese eternally unelected government would ever apologize to any white Western government for anything whatsoever (which is normal statecraft in this world by the way). What I find no longer funny but unnerving about the latest liberal groveling is not only how pointless it is, but how it indicates the truly slow minds of liberals. These people don&rsquo;t learn anything; how are such learning disabled people able to get into high office?</p>
