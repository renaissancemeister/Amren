			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ylan Q. Mui, Washington Post, August 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five years after Hurricane Katrina, the rebuilding of the Big Easy has created a new community of Latino immigrants in this famously insular city, redrawing racial lines in a town long defined by black and white.</p>
<p>The change began just weeks after one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, which decimated homes, upended lives and drove a chunk of New Orleans&rsquo;s black population to Baton Rouge, Houston and other places.</p>
<p>Although the overall number of Latinos isn&rsquo;t huge, the population continues to grow and has had an outsize impact on the culture of this proudly eccentric city and on how people here view their home town. {snip}</p>
<p>The emergence of Latinos in the emotionally and politically charged aftermath of the storm sparked outcries from displaced residents who felt their jobs and their status in the city were being challenged. In one infamous news conference, Mayor C. Ray Nagin pledged to return New Orleans to a &#8220;chocolate city&#8221; after previously asking what he could do to keep the city from being &#8220;overrun by Mexican workers.&#8221; A documentary released last week by Latino performance artist Jose Torres-Tama titled &#8220;From Chocolate City to Enchilada Village&#8221; is reigniting the controversy on local talk radio.</p>
<p>Political and physical confrontations in the past couple of years have added to the distrust. One parish attempted to limit multi-family homes, a move that critics said targeted the Latino community. Another banned roving taco trucks, and state legislators considered requiring police to check immigration status after arrests. New Orleans police have reported repeated assaults on Latino workers, often targeted because they tend to carry cash, and have appointed one bilingual outreach officer to help combat the crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>In the Lower Ninth</b></p>
<p>Nowhere is the shift more apparent than in the Lower Ninth Ward, a low-income neighborhood that suffered some of the worst flooding in the city. Of the roughly 5,000 residents who used to live here  &mdash;  almost all of whom were black  &mdash;  only a quarter have returned, according to an analysis by the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From his makeshift seat, Williams surveyed the remains of the Lower Ninth. The once bustling convenience store across the street that became famous for its cheeky slogan  &mdash;  &#8220;You Can&rsquo;t Beat Wagner&rsquo;s Meat!&#8221;  &mdash;  is abandoned and dark. The house next door has been torn down, an empty lot of overgrown weeds in its place. The public bus doesn&rsquo;t stop here anymore.</p>
<p>One of the few signs of life is a taco truck in his parking lot. Latino workers in paint-spattered jeans and work boots line up at the tiny window every day for fresh gorditas, tacos and burritos.</p>
<p>In what has become a near-daily ritual, Marco Topete, 28, pulled up to the taco truck in his black sport-utility vehicle. Two weeks after Hurricane Katrina, he drove from Houston to New Orleans with about 30 other construction workers. There were no houses or hotels to stay in, so he slept under an interstate overpass with other Latino workers in what became known as Bridge City. Now he is laying concrete for the avant garde homes being built in the Lower Ninth by a nonprofit funded by Brad Pitt. So far, 50 of the planned 150 have been completed, and a spokeswoman said another 25 are expected before the end of the year. Meanwhile, Topete has settled in the more affluent neighborhood of Lakeview and three months ago brought his 18-year-old brother, Rogelio, to the city to work and go to school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to census data analyzed by the New Orleans data center, the percentage of Hispanics in the New Orleans area jumped from 4.4 percent in 2000 to 6.6 percent last year. Advocacy groups put the figure at closer to 10 percent or more as many workers, fearful of interacting with the government, avoid being counted. The percentage of blacks fell from 37.1 percent to 34.5 percent, with the decline more pronounced in the city, where African Americans have long been the majority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On radio station WBOK, program director Gerod Stevens fields calls daily from black listeners angry because they feel Latinos have depressed their wages and snatched up their jobs. They are frustrated that the Lower Ninth Ward has yet to be rebuilt like neighborhoods populated by wealthier white residents.</p>
<p><b>The racial divide</b></p>
<p>There have been some attempts to bridge the divide. Latino advocacy groups have been guests on Stevens&rsquo;s show. Soriano said blacks and Latinos share many of the same concerns post-Katrina, including employers who refuse to pay them after the work has been done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here in the South, no matter if you are Latino or African American. You are a person of color,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are a lot of people who don&rsquo;t think you have rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Stevens said many blacks have rejected the idea, feeling that Latinos want to piggyback on the gains blacks have made after hundreds of years of discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who has fought all of the civil rights, human rights battles since Day One? It&rsquo;s been us,&#8221; said one angry caller, Edward Parker, 66.</p>

<p>In any turf battle between blacks and Mexicans, I&rsquo;m reminded of Henry Kissinger&rsquo;s appraisal of the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&rsquo;t they BOTH lose?&#8221;</p>

If AR saved the posts, you can go back and read how everything was predicted by AR posters.</p>
<p><i>But Stevens said many blacks have rejected the idea, feeling that Latinos want to piggyback on the gains blacks have made after hundreds of years of discrimination.</i></p>
<p>Too true but blacks have only their leaders to blame for promoting a black/brown coalition pipe dream. </p>
<p>Hispanics have no legit claims to alleged historic discrimination or injustice since they came here by choice.</p>

		<p>Blacks, except for the intelligent minority, are doomed. The Hispanics are winning all the turf battles.  From Chicago to Baltimore to DC to NYC. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much superior intelligence, but a group loyalty and some sense of heritage which whites used to have. Too bad the Hispanics don&rsquo;t have the brains of the Jews, Asians or Anglo-Saxons. </p>
<p>They would rule the world. The blacks will find the Hispanics won&rsquo;t have the guilt-ridden sorrow of the white intelligentsia and media towards the slavery-doomed African American population.</p>

		<p>I think some divide-and-conquer could actually be a really good thing. And remember that as more and more minorities begin to voice their racial attitudes - out in the open and as obviously as this - it WILL eventually become more acceptable for US to do so as well.</p>

		<p>Again, sbuffalonative hit it on the head. Virtually every AmRen poster predicted 5 years ago that New Orleans would transform beginning immediately to a dumping ground of Hispanics; many of whom were newly reinvigorated to jump the border. Who, even blindfolded, didn&rsquo;t see this coming? I hope N.O. enjoys their new found diversity as much as the rest of the country.</p>

<p>   I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re doomed but they are in deep trouble. Unless, blacks support immigration restrictions, they are set to be big losers in the coming restribution of political power. They better get used to increased hostile competition with Chicanos, if not all Hispanics. </p>

When AR first reported this years ago, I asked, why was it possible to move Hispanic workers to NO and provide them with housing and yet local blacks weren&rsquo;t taking these jobs and it was claimed they had no housing for blacks who then had to move out of state?</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t think for a minute that Hispanics in New Orleans will be an improvement over Blacks.  The Hispanics are more mobile, while Blacks tend to stay within their own neighborhoods. Many blacks (until Katrina) never left Orleans Parish&hellip;ever&hellip;from cradle to grave. And Hispanics have been taught, for centuries, ways of hate brought by Inquisition-era Spain.</p>
<p>Last time I was there (my last trip to that particular Saks Fifth Avenue&hellip;too dangerous getting through the city to Canal street, now&hellip;), several years back, on the news, there was the story of a Gay Jewish Kid at Tulane, beaten to death, I think, by several Hispanic students from an adjacent school.  That&rsquo;s the kind of thing you can expect, from here on out.</p>
<p>In my perception, for every Derrick Todd Lee, there are Three Angel Resendiz&hellip;.simply because Hispanics come from a predatory culture of hate and violence, and because they get around more.</p>
<p>I laugh at the assertion that &#8220;this is the South&#8221; (New Orleans is considered Latin America&hellip;a separate, corrupt, and alien culture&hellip;by Southerners), and because of that, &#8220;persons of color&#8221; are cheated out of their pay by their employers.</p>
<p>Something tells me that not a single one of those corrupt employers is truly &#8216;white&rsquo;.  Huey Long said something to the effect that there were very few genuine White People in Orleans Parish.  That was an exaggeration, but I doubt even one of those paycheck-stealing corrupt employers could have gotten into our Country Club, when I was growing up.  If those black and brown workers are being discriminated against, it is by other persons of color&hellip;not Whites.</p>

		<p>In conflicts between Hispanics and blacks I generally favor Hispanics.  They have a crime rate that is three times the white rate, but less than half the black rate.  <br>
 <br>
I like Mexican food and Mexican music.  The women are often beautiful.  <br>
 <br>
There is really nothing in the black culture that appeals to me.  In the 1960&rsquo;s I liked soul music, but rap music is ugly and morally outrageous.  <br>
 <br>
I can only like blacks if they are Anglicized.  They can be as black as pitch, and have black accents, but they need to act white, have white values, and speak standard English.  <br>
 <br>
Hispanics are a hybrid race of whites and American Indians, with a blessedly small input from Africa.  They have lower crime rates than blacks, and higher average IQs because they have more European genes.  </p>

		<p>5,000 blacks in the Ninth ward, the media acts like there were 500,000 before Katrina.Of course Mexicans are in New Orleans. Black young men won`t go back there because they don`t want a job. The Mexicans are working like ants day and night. The black youth would rather hang out in the clubs of Houston and Atlanta and hustle teenage girls and sell dope to white college kids.If you can make 5000 a month selling dope why make 2000 a month busting your hump. I think we should give all black people from the Big easy under 30 another two thousand  dollars to jump start the economies of Atlanta,Camden and Houston. They could turn that 2 grand into ten ounces of flake and 200 hits of crack. Capitalism in the Ghetto,don`t you love it.<br>

My sentiments exactly, Hispanics have also across the board made a more concerted effort to assimilate, and Hispanic women do not seem to have a problem with white men. When it comes to race choose your battles wisely, Hispnics are nowhere near the top of the order of battle.</p>

		<p>ON THE LAM FROM THE THOUGHT POLICE:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re WAY too kind in your assessment of Mestizo culture. Sure, ANYTHING is better than African mayhem, but Mestizos have such a primitive streak; ridiculous machismo-so stupid it would be funny, if it weren&rsquo;t so deadly.<br>
A disgusting tendency toward what is unquestionably considered pedophilia in the dying Western world;  grown men chasing after twelve year old girls. <br>
Drunkenness and driving. And I mean open bottles at noon on a monday!<br>
A tendency to beat the snot out of women, without shame, but rather, pride. Mestizos got one hell of a bad genetic mix! South Amerindian (Brutal to the point of cannibalism and mass human sacrifice), Arab-infused Spaniard blood&hellip;hmm, the spanish inquisition meets sharia? Ooh, sign me up for that!</p>
<p>Need I go on?<br>
Keep your tamales.</p>

<p>  It is quite true that New Orleans is an alien French Caribbean culture transplanted to America, and yet one can still love the melancholy decay of that old run-down, historic city. By the way, French Creoles are well aware of the dangers of miscegenation because they daily observe the results of such tragic mixtures. Corruption is endemic as it is in much of Latin America. People know how to have fun and enjoy life, but you can say the same about Rio de Janeiro.  I&rsquo;m afraid the United States is becoming a Brazil without the fun.</p>

		<p>To poster #2, I also have found many &#8216;good&rsquo; latinos, but they tend to be more white and more south american.  The more mestizo they are, the greater the liklihood of the kinds of troubles we all talk about here vis-a-vis voodoos, although to be fair, I have interacted with mestizos and even full-blooded amerindians who were quite good, though they tended to be from very rural backgrounds and almost all converted to some form of protestantism.</p>
<p>In my voluminous experience, half the mestizo males I&rsquo;ve seen have a genetic disposition to failure.  The other half are hard working nd have good values.  Why can&rsquo;t we deport the gang bangers and lazy drunks?  America used to have standards for immigrants.  I don&rsquo;t mind good people of any race, as long as they assimilate to my culture and not the other way around.</p>
