			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nathan Burchfiel, NewsBusters, August 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} As noted by the Daily Caller&rsquo;s Jim Treacher, much of the coverage [of Glenn Beck&rsquo;s &#8220;Restoring Honor&#8221; rally] had a common thread: describing the crowd as &#8220;overwhelmingly white.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Virtually every major &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media outlet has used the phrase in just the past year to describe conservative events.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All three broadcast networks have described the Tea Parties as &#8220;overwhelmingly white.&#8221; So have CNN, MSNBC, NPR, the Agence France Presse, The Washington Post, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, National Journal and US News &amp; World Report. Many of those organizations are the very ones the news industry discusses as having failed to make diversity goals for staff.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>* &#8220;The crowds turning out for the Tea Party Express rallies are overwhelmingly white.&#8221;  &mdash;  Ed Lavandera, CNN &#8220;American Morning&#8221; March 31, 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* &#8220;The crowd that greeted Palin did nothing to contradict the common description of Tea Party supporters as overwhelmingly white and mostly older.&#8221;  &mdash;  Ina Jaffe, NPR &#8220;Weekend Edition Sunday&#8221; March 28, 2010.</p>
<p>* &#8220;They are overwhelmingly white and Anglo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;  &mdash;  USA Today July 2, 2010.</p>
<p>{snip} In coverage of Beck&rsquo;s rally, some outlets opted for the less aggressive &#8220;predominantly white&#8221; label, while others described the crowd as &#8220;nearly all-white.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Brad Wilmouth reported on NewsBusters, ABC&rsquo;s Tahman Bradley called the crowd &#8220;almost all white,&#8221; and suggested that presence of Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s niece, Dr. Alveda King, as a speaker was &#8220;an obvious effort to try to show inclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The charge leveled at conservative demonstrators is especially ironic given the accusers. The media are notoriously &#8220;overwhelmingly white.&#8221; The American Society of Newspaper Editors reported in April 2010 that minorities total only 13.26 percent of newsroom staff, a decline from the previous year. The report found 465 newspapers have no minorities on their full-time staffs, a number that &#8220;has been growing since 2006.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization launched a program in 1978 that &#8220;challenged the newspaper industry to achieve racial parity by 2000 or sooner.&#8221; It failed. That goal has since been moved to 2025 because, &#8220;Over three decades, the annual survey has shown that while there has been progress, the racial diversity of newsrooms does not come close to the fast-growing diversity in the U.S. population as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} So how has the diversity-challenge Post handled the Tea Party?</p>
<p>* &#8220;But, [Tea Party rally attendee Jeff Link] says, looking at the crowd, which is overwhelmingly white and middle-aged, &#8216;it saddens me not to see this gathering more diverse.&rsquo;&#8221;  &mdash;  Feb. 6, 2010.</p>
<p>* &#8220;The new poll offers a portrait of tea party supporters as overwhelmingly white, mostly conservative and generally disapproving of Obama.&#8221;  &mdash;  Feb. 11, 2010</p>
<p>* &#8220;They are overwhelming white (94 percent) and conservative (73 percent).&#8221;  &mdash;  April 2, 2010</p>
<p> * &#8220;Tea Party activists, like Perot voters, are overwhelmingly white.&#8221;  &mdash;  April 18, 2010</p>
<p>The New York Times reported in January that minority journalists appear to be suffering the most from newsroom cutbacks. But the report on journalism&rsquo;s diversity issues wasn&rsquo;t nearly as smug as a Feb. 16 report about Tea Parties:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Newspapers aren&rsquo;t alone. The third annual Television Newsroom Management Diversity Census found that &#8220;persons of color&#8221; only make up 12.6 percent of staff in TV newsrooms. A 2007 survey by the Radio Television Digital News Association found that minorities make up 21.5 percent of the television news workforce  &mdash;  higher than print but still short of the 34.5 percent of the population. Only 10.2 percent of broadcast news directors are minorities.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t stop broadcast outlets from pointing the finger at conservatives.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Do you have any concerns when you look out at the crowds and they&rsquo;re mostly, well, overwhelmingly white people?&#8221;  &mdash;  Terry Moran, ABC &#8220;Nightline&#8221; Nov. 2, 2009.</p>
<p>* &#8220;You know, one thing to keep in mind about the Tea Party is that it is an overwhelmingly white movement.&#8221;  &mdash;  Ron Brownstein, NBC &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; April 18, 2010.</p>

		<p>Did any of these people say something about the Million Man March? So what are they trying to insinuate, anyway? I hope it&rsquo;s the start of a trend. Let the leaders and speakers be bolder and more forthright. Farrakhan isn&rsquo;t scared to be explicit about who he&rsquo;s looking out for; lets expect just as much from ourselves. </p>

		<p>We must find a way to hold elite Whites accountable to their non white pets.  How can we force them to give up their jobs to more deserving people of color?  How can we force them to only live where blacks have control of all government?</p>

Aren&rsquo;t you just lusting over the possibility that ousted white-hating, Christ-hating Whitey Jon Meacham will be replaced at Newsweek with at non white, a woman, or a gay?</p>

<p>By now, our situation, racially, is so far-gone that you don&rsquo;t have to do anything or say anything to get into trouble &hellip;. just BEING &#8220;overwhemingly white&#8221; is bad enough to invite their attacks. Merely being white and together with other whites is considered wicked ehough and places you under suspicion.  </p>
<p>We see these basically white groups (even socially) that are desperate to include at least a token black here or there to legitimize themselves and let them relax in feeling that they are not &#8220;racists&#8221;. Yet, despite  all their frantic denials that they are NOT racists, that means nothing to their critics.</p>
<p>It has gotten so that Americans do not feel comfortable without a token &#8220;minority&#8221; in their group to demonstrate their &#8220;diversity&#8221; and anti-racism. Otherwise, they feel vaguely guilty.</p>
<p>Will we come to the day when gatherings of more than three whites are banned as criminal and subversive? It&rsquo;s not impossible!</p>
<p><i>Many of those organizations are the very ones the news industry discusses as having failed to make diversity goals for staff.</i></p>
<p>Nothing new or surprising there.  What&rsquo;s for me, and what&rsquo;s for three, are always two different things.  (&#8220;Do as I say and not as I do.&#8221;) The media have always held themselves to a different standard. That&rsquo;s the mark of a ruling class.</p>

I&rsquo;ll bet no news media personality described the Sharpton rally as overwhelmingly black (which it was).</p>
<p>At one point, someone on stage made a remark close to, &#8216;I love seeing all these black people&rsquo;. I wondered what the press would have done to Beck had he said something similar about his audience.<br>

		<p> The Glenn Beck rally, and the Tea Party Movement, are &#8220;overwhelmingly White,&#8221; to quote the disapproving phrase of the MSM, because it&rsquo;s White people who are finally waking up in this country, and trying to take it back before it&rsquo;s too late. They are &#8220;older&#8221; (older than what, I wonder?) because it&rsquo;s people who have had some life experience who realize what a horrific mess this country is in.</p>
<p> Look at any Leftist rally or march (or riot) and who do you see in it? Predominantly young people. Is it because they are &#8220;the wave of the future&#8221;? Hell, no, although that&rsquo;s what the liberal media would like us to believe. It&rsquo;s because naive idealism appeals to people who have little life experience to compare it with. As we grow older, hopefully we grow smarter   &mdash;   and more conservative.</p>

		<p>Of course, what they are really saying is that America is too White. The immigration enthusiasts are demanding that the Native Born White Majority commit racial suicide within the borders of America. Native Born White Americans are no obligation to do this.</p>
<p>Or to put it another way, the media elites-Chris Mathews and Kieth Oberman both paid millions of $$$ each year to commit race treason- who say that the Tea Party rallies are too white are demanding that Native Born White Americans put thier fate in the hands of high fertility post-1965 hostile Asians,Muslims,Hispanics,Carribeans and Africans. </p>
<p>We really need to on the attack against the race-replacement enhusiasts. And they way you do it is to respond the way I did above:to the heart of the issue&hellip;.in-your-face-way. Don&rsquo;t be nice about it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Overwhelmingly white&#8221; to the overwhelmingly liberal media translates to &#8220;being racist&#8221; without having the guts to come right out and say it. Which is the sad state of affairs this country has sunk to when white people gather for any reason. And I am not surprised that newsrooms are still made up of a white majority, because being able to spell and be grammatically correct are still required. But the shame of it is that the liberal biased media only hire people with their same views, so to appear hip and non racist they cleverly (so they think) disparage any way of thinking different than their own. I&rsquo;ve got news for them - more and more people can see right through their hypocrisy - and we&rsquo;re getting real tired of it!   </p>

		<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re hypocrites, but the trouble with this sort of argument is that it basically accepts the criminalization of whiteness.  &#8220;We&rsquo;re evil white racists?  Oh yeah, well you&rsquo;re just as racist as we are!&#8221;  Liberals are white hating Nazis, and that is the basis on which to attack them.  Go ahead and mention their hypocrisy but follow it up with pointed questions about the way the liberal media deals with (sponsors) racist violence against whites.  For example, how is it that neither the Washington Post or the New York Times have never noticed that large areas of their cities are no-go zones for whites?  Do you really think that organs that have basically lied in support of mass racist violence and civil rights violations have a right to lecture anyone on tolerance?  Etc.</p>

		<p>The MSM are the biggest hypocrites in the world (aside from the liberals in general). This &#8220;overwhelmingly white&#8221; remark is clearly a hate smear against white people. The crowd is &#8220;overwhelmingly white?&#8221; So what&rsquo;s odd or unusual about that? Whites are the movers and shakers of society. Always have been, always will be. So to observe that any group of movers and shakers is &#8220;overwhelmingly white&#8221; is like observing that the sun has once again risen in the morning.</p>
<p> Just once when this &#8220;overwhelmingly white&#8221; smear is trotted out, I would like to hear someone,  a guest or anyone else, reply, &#8220;You say that like it&rsquo;s a bad thing,&#8221; and then ask them to justify their statement. </p>
<p>Even better would be to then point out the hypocrisy of the MSM as this article does. The MSM has had over 30 years to fully &#8220;diversify&#8221; its staff and has failed to do so. By now, their staffs should be 40-50% non-white just to show their good intentions, but of course they&rsquo;re only 10-12% at best.</p>
<p>The problem is, whites are so brainwashed and numbed in this country that they don&rsquo;t even question statements like this, much less challenge them.</p>

		<p>In a majority-white country, the only events that will not be overwhelmingly white are those celebrations geared toward non-whites, such as the Million Man March or a pro-illegal rally orchestrated by La Raza.  <br>
As for Beck&rsquo;s meeting, the press conveniently misses the significance of the Sharpton rally nearby.  Wouldn&rsquo;t most black people be more likely to attend it?  And I wonder if it was overwhelmingly black?  In schools that permit a multiracial prom and a black prom, does anyone call the former a &#8220;white prom&#8221; and castigate school officials because more black students didn&rsquo;t attend it?  </p>

<p>I have to laugh when I see those unrealistic TV commercials of white guys with their mandatory black male buddies hanging out as though you&rsquo;re some kind of racist if you don&rsquo;t have minority friends&hellip;but you see more and more movies with an all-black cast. </p>

		<p>I cannot imagine an entity that has done more harm to Native Born White Americans than the propaganda media.</p>
<p>The American media never pass up an opportunity to bash Whites and portray us as inhuman, racist monsters only interested in &#8216;preserving White America&rsquo; which they interpret and blare out as beyond evil.  </p>
<p>They hypocritically insist on promoting and encouraging non-White solidarity against Whites, non-White sob stories of evil White Oppression, massive, non-White integration into White homelands  &mdash;  yet gladly cover-up massive non-White criminality including mass murder, torture-murders, drunken driving murders.</p>
<p>Black mass murderer omar thornton (non caps on purpose) was described by the msm as &#8216;hard working&rsquo;, &#8216;quiet&rsquo;, and &#8216;non violent&rsquo; and who was presumably sent to the breaking point by continued harassment of White Racists at his workplace; therefore, the murders are justified.</p>
<p>I never did read about the victims of the mass murder  &mdash;  but then as they were White, in the eyes of the media, their lives were worthless.</p>
<p>This story was barely a blip on the West Coast, hardly mentioned and forgotten within days while stories about supposed nooses and White rape hoaxes are front page, above the fold, bold headlines for weeks and months on end.  One could hardly get away from the coverage of these &#8216;major events.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The biased, White-hating news media hypocritically insist on forced AA, forced busing, forced integration for us Whites, yet:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The American Society of Newspaper Editors reported in April 2010 that minorities total only 13.26 percent of newsroom staff, a decline from the previous year. The report found 465 newspapers have no minorities on their full-time staffs, a number that &#8216;has been growing since 2006.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The organization launched a program in 1978 that &#8216;challenged the newspaper industry to achieve racial parity by 2000 or sooner.&rsquo; It failed. That goal has since been moved to 2025&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That goal has been moved to &#8216;never&rsquo; as the media, a closed, elitist institution, going around on a Möbius strip with its Whites = Evil and non-Whites = Good mantra, has no intention of opening itself up to hiring lesser qualified AA candidates.  They also know the government will look the other way.</p>
<p>No self-respecting White should support, with their hard earned, near-worthless dollars, an institution that promotes and encourages hatred of Whites and seeks our dispossession, if not destruction.</p>

		<p>This Tea Party/Glenn Beck  phenomenon reveals the desperation of whites to have something of their own, something thay can indentify with, something in common    &mdash;   even if they dare not say so.  Pathetic.</p>
<p>As for Glen Beck, I knew almost nothing about him, so I looked him up and did some reading. I approached the subject with complete neutrality. But the more I read, the more I disliked.  </p>
<p>Who is behind this guy? How did he emerge from out of nowhere? His rally was  as cynically staged and as professional as a Michael Jackson rock  concert. Something to appeal to everyone.  His &#8220;performance&#8221; is a hyped-up example of Disneyland combined with bizarre religion and politics. </p>
<p>This new &#8220;Elmer Gantry&#8221; (as he&rsquo;s been called) is a really depressing case, if he is considered to be some sort of white leader (even though he would be the first to repudiate that designation.)   It&rsquo;s not only his ignorant, garbled ideology, but his entire history that makes him suspect. This man is plainly a disturbed personality, with a personal and family history of alcoholism and drug abuse and suicide. Hardly someone to look up to as a pillar of stability and guidance!  </p>
<p> [&#8220;After getting clean, Beck would claim that he had gotten high every day for the previous 15 years, since the age of sixteen.&#8221;   &mdash;   Wiki]</p>
<p>Is this the best representative  we&rsquo;ve got?  Is this America&rsquo;s latest political fad? Our latest &#8220;conservative&#8221; messiah who&rsquo;s going to save us?  Our answer to Obama?  Again I say, pathetic!</p>
<p><br>
But there&rsquo;s no end to American gullibility.  According to Forbes magazine,  &#8220;Glenn Beck has managed to monetize virtually everything that comes out of his mouth.&#8221;   In April 2010, Forbes calculated Beck&rsquo;s earnings for the previous year  to be $32 million.  [Wiki]<br>

		<p>Just in from Vancouver,WA. A young woman named Bethany Storo who had just moved to Vancouver was attacked in a shopping center parking lot. A Black woman walked up to her and tapped her on the shoulder and when Bethany turned around the Mau Mau threw acid in her face. The girl&rsquo;s sun glasses protected her eyes but her face is severely disfigured.  The victim&rsquo;s picture was shown. She is a pretty girl who might be Filipina. There is a full scale man hunt on for the Mau Mauette.</p>
<p>I suspect that Afros make up a small percentage of the population of Washington but they sure as Hell commit a lot of  the violence.</p>

 Overwhelmingly black police department in Atlanta gives perp descriptions as &#8220;black.&#8221;  I find that offensive.</p>
<p>We are constantly bombarded by &#8220;distinguished, esteemed, renowned&#8221; African Americans, so I want to see them called African Americans when they prove they have the courage to emancipate themselves from White Humanity&rsquo;s Laws and jess be kepp&rsquo;n it real by acting African.</p>
<p>We demand no more &#8220;black&#8221; in descriptions of wanted fugitives.  If any are African Americans, they are all African Americans.</p>

Suppose someone found a news article from 1930s Germany in which the writer described some group as &#8216;overwhelmingly Jewish&rsquo;?</p>
<p>We have to confront these people and ask them, &#8216;what&rsquo;s wrong with any group being overwhelmingly white? Are they considered a danger or a threat? If so, what danger or threat do they hold?&rsquo;</p>

		<p>If the media all of the sudden is so quick to peg large groups by their racial make-up perhaps we&rsquo;ll see this in some future newspaper:</p>
<p>Sports News - Basketball<br>
The overwhelmingly black Miami Heat defeated the overwhelmingly black Detroit Pistons last night in front of an overwhelmingly white crowd in south Florida. After the game, a crowd of overwhelming black youths celebrated by attacking the cars of the overwhelmingly white fans as they left the arena. Police arrested an overwhelmingly large number of blacks following the incident but they were bailed out by an overwhelmingly large group of white civil libertarians who claimed the arrests were racial in nature.</p>
<p>An overwhelmingly large group of blacks planned to protest the arrests by marching to police headquarters tomorrow demanding more benefits and social services from the overwhelmingly white taxpayers to prevent the overwhelmingly large population of incarcerated blacks from growing even larger.</p>
<p>A group of overwhelmingly large white team owners have pledged $100,000 for neighborhood gyms to keep the overwhelmingly large number of unemployed blacks from slipping into crime on the streets. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, an overwhelming number of white fans were oblivious to the attacks and protests - which were not reported by the overwhelmingly white media - and apparently have no plans to stop attending home games despite recent criminal activities by an overwhelming number of local blacks.   </p>

		<p>Just imagine some TV spokesman would slip and complain that an audience in some other country was &#8220;overwhelmingly black/brown/yellow&#8221;?!</p>
<p>If some liberal zealots would look at the big picture they might realize that worldwide Whites ARE a minority. We are less than 20%. Shouldn&rsquo;t they fight for higher numbers when they care about DIVERSITY?</p>
<p>For a mathematically more sound / perfect diversity worldwide the number of Whites would have to be much higher. <br>
But as pseudo-diversity fanatics they have no global perception - they just look at that fragment of reality that suits their ideology.<br>
If they were REALLY colorblind concerning races resp. post-racial they couldn&rsquo;t possibly report like that. </p>
<p>Will there be a time when they complain that a White couple was TOO White? After all nothing &#8220;corrects&#8221; being overwhelmingly White more thoroughly than miscegenation.</p>
<p>I just read an article by a Belgian journalist who was proud to have talked a right wing politician into &#8220;admitting&#8221; that he would prefer Eurasia to stay majority White. That journalist then went on to rant how evil such thinking was and that this man had revealed his Nazi views.</p>
<p>Could ANYBODY anywhere imagine that somebody would complain if a Chinese said he wanted China to remain majority Chinese? </p>
<p>For MSM the reality is an unimportant dimension that simply doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

		<p>This is a slow, soft pitch right over the plate!  What a great opportunity to wake up our kin.  Each and every one who is opposed to white genocide should hit this one right out of the park.  Repeatedly!  </p>
<p>Whenever comments are made that so clearly and simply expose hatred for white people, it is a golden opportunity to strike a blow for the safety and survival of our children by simply pointing it out: Anyone who has a problem with &#8220;overwhelmingly white&#8221;, or &#8220;very white&#8221;, or even &#8220;completely white&#8221;,  is simply anti-white. </p>
<p> This is what we can all do the halt the slide into destruction.  It&rsquo;s easy, and it&rsquo;s non-violent.  Indeed, it is not only the most humane way, it is the only viable way to prevent (put a stop to, rather) violence against white people.  <br>
Just tell it like it is.  That&rsquo;s all it takes.   </p>

   &mdash;  Graziani</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Excellent example.  But you know what?  I spot a concession right there.  Without even realizing it, he &#8220;admits&#8221; that he wants it to remain <i>&#8220;MAJORITY&#8221;  </i>white.  </p>
<p>A hundred years ago, or even fifty, he would have insisted that it remain &#8220;white&#8221;&hellip; period.  Plain and simple, without a second thought. Now, we&rsquo;ve been whittled  down to hoping for at least &#8220;majority&#8221; status in our ancestral homelands! As long as we keep backing down, we keep getting a smaller slice of the pie.</p>
<p>But non-whites (i.e. the Chinese) are held to a different standard. As always.</p>
<p>As for the journalist, it&rsquo;s not surprising. To a  doctrinaire Marxist, race is totally irrelevant. It&rsquo;s just surface coloring, nothing more. Does it matter if a flower is red or yellow or blue?  So what!  A flower is a flower.  And so it is with race to a Marxist:  a human of any race of color is identical to any other.</p>
<p>This is one of the central tenets of their &#8220;religion&#8221;; and Marxism IS a religion. I MEAN that!  Thus, if you deny that egalitarian principal, you&rsquo;re offending their dearly-held religion. You might as well deny Allah to a Moslem. They would both think you&rsquo;re crazy (or just downright evil)&hellip; how can you deny what is divinely obvious?   That&rsquo;s why Marxists hate &#8220;racists&#8221; and fight genetic research so passionately. You are threatening their religious beliefs.<br>

<p>Yes, I have no doubt you&rsquo;re right. If one kind of laid out its data structures and those of some other religions they would be isomorphic. And its adherents are quite fanatic, too. <br>
They&rsquo;re very *tolerant and nonviolent*   &mdash;   as long as you don&rsquo;t talk back. Which I experienced several times   &mdash;   there is no civilized discussion possible if you question their creed, which   &mdash;   with its materialistic Pseudo-gods   &mdash;   is suppressive instead of convincing and destructive instead of charitable   &mdash;   both in opposition to Christianity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Pope Benedict said in 2005 &#8220;A society that is not at all concerned with God destroys itself. We saw that in the totalitarian experiments of the last century.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t oppose religion per se. After all it was in the Christian (and white) world, where most of mankind&rsquo;s achievements were made (cf. Charles Murray: &#8220;Human Accomplishment&#8221;).</p>

		<p>For about a month or so this year our local newstalk radio station 1010 WINS had a black radio host in the morning.  He&rsquo;s gone now.  The minute I heard his voice I just listened to see if it had any affect on me.  I&rsquo;m sorry to say that the deep afro tones in his voice did make me feel like something was out of place.</p>
<p>He was paired with the long serving Jewish guy, whose voice sounds normal.  Whenever the black guy spoke, you could tell he was straining to pronounce things correctly and reaching to add the right inflections when called for.  There was a lag in both instances so it became hard to listen to the reports he was saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure so many people stopped listening and went over to am 880 that they either canned him or moved him to another time slot.</p>
<p>Also, ever wonder that whenever there is a report about black crime on TV news, they almost always choose a black reporter? </p>

		<p>First, I have not heard anything about non-Whites being told not to come to these events.  Second, there is no way anyone can force another to come.  Third, and probably most important, a lot of complaining about the president is heard at these events.  The president is Black.  Anyone who cannot understand that?</p>
