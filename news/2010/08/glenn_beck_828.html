<h1>Glenn Beck 8/28 Rally  &mdash;  The Death Rattle of Mainstream Conservatism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Edwards, Political Cesspool, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Glenn Beck&rsquo;s big rally at the Lincoln Memorial a couple days ago is the talk of the news media and the internet. {snip}</p>
<p>Nobody is really sure what it was even about. {snip}</p>
<p>It was about &#8220;restoring honor&#8221; or something, whatever that&rsquo;s supposed to mean.</p>
<p>Or it was a way of supporting the troops, depending on which day you listened to Beck.</p>
<p>Then it turned into a rally to reclaim the Civil Rights movement, and give it back to the people who Beck swears pioneered the Civil Rights movement, right wing conservatives. Yes, that&rsquo;s what Beck actually claims to believe. {snip}</p>
<p>It also has something do with honoring all those unsung heroes of the American Revolution, the numerous black Founding Fathers, whose existence (until Beck came along to set the record straight) has been covered up by &#8220;liberals&#8221; who are trying to divide us by race. {snip}</p>
<p>And Palin? She was asked what Martin Luther King would&rsquo;ve thought of the rally. This was a great opportunity to tell it like it is for all of America to hear. She could&rsquo;ve said something like: &#8220;Martin Luther King? I&rsquo;m white  &mdash;  why would I give a damn what Martin Luther King would&rsquo;ve thought about this rally? At any rate, he no doubt would have disapproved, as he was a radical left wing socialist whose movement was all about increasing the size and power of the federal government, and using it to take rights and resources from white people and give them to non-whites. Hell no he wouldn&rsquo;t have approved, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of that fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>But did she say anything like that? Of course not. {snip}</p>
<p>(Of course, none of this idiotic pandering did anything to convince liberals and non-whites that Beck, Palin, and the hundreds of thousands of white people who showed up at the rally are anything but despicable racists and Nazis.)</p>
<p>As it turned out, the rally was actually a huge revival meeting, in which Beck implored America to turn back to the god(s) of our Jewish-Christian-Muslim-Hindu-Mormon-Voodoo-Sikh-Zoroastrian heritage that made America great. He had over 200 members of the clergy on the podium, and he stressed that they were from &#8220;all faiths&#8221; and it didn&rsquo;t matter which god we pray to, as long as we pray to something or someone, singular or plural. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clearly, Beck&rsquo;s rally was a vague, confused jumble of meaninglessness. Or, if you prefer, a hot ghetto mess. Yet many conservatives are excited and thrilled, and think that 8/28/10 will forever be remembered as some kind of turning point, as the day when the huge task of &#8220;taking America back&#8221; formally got underway. In reality, it was the exact opposite. I&rsquo;m convinced that one of these days, we&rsquo;ll look back on this as the nadir of the mainstream conservative movement, as its death rattle, as the day the conservative movement gave up the ghost. Hundreds of thousands of white conservatives spent millions of dollars to travel to DC, to stand around and do nothing, for no reason in particular, after being ordered not to bring any signs to express themselves, while Beck and Palin lectured them on the glories of The Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., and the importance of getting back to the fundamentals of the Christian-Jewish-Muslim-Hindu-Sikh-Mormon-Voodoo faiths.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The demographic changes that have transformed Orange County are also transforming the rest of America. The process may be further along in Orange County, but it&rsquo;s happening everywhere. Thanks to immigration, sixty percent of the babies being born in Texas are non-white, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of a few more elections before Texas&rsquo;s electoral votes go to the Democrats, and when that happens, the GOP can forget about putting one of their own in the White House ever again. And there are many other cities and states that are right behind Texas, and lots more where the process will take a few more decades to have the same effect, but all of America is on its way to turning into Orange County, California.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Beck Heads and Tea Partiers are losing their country. Not because they don&rsquo;t attend their local mosque often enough. But they can&rsquo;t admit that, because that would be &#8220;racist&#8221;, and losing your country is a lot better than being called &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a conservative movement as willingly impotent as the crowd that came to DC on Saturday can&rsquo;t go on much longer. At some point it&rsquo;s going to dawn on them that no matter how much they grovel to MLK and praise his holy name, or how many &#8220;conservative&#8221; imams, shamans, and witch doctors they pack their podiums with, they still get called racists and Nazis, and their country just keeps slipping further down the tubes.</p>
<p>When that finally sinks in with conservatives, and it may be sooner than we think, things will start to get interesting.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.slate.com/id/2265515/?from=rss">White Fright</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Christopher Hitchens, Slate, August 30, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>One crucial element of the American subconscious is about to become salient and explicit and highly volatile. It is the realization that white America is within thinkable distance of a moment when it will no longer be the majority. This awareness already exists in places like New York and Texas and California, and there have even been projections of the time(s) at which it will occur and when different nonwhite populations will collectively outnumber the former white majority. But it also exerts a strong subliminal effect in states like Alaska that have an overwhelming white preponderance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For example, so strong is the moral stature of the Rev. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement that even the white right prefers to pretend to emulate it. {snip} But it is increasingly common to hear allegations that Obama is either foreign-born or a Muslim. And these insinuations are perfectly emblematic of the two main fears of the old majority: that it will be submerged by an influx from beyond the borders and that it will be challenged in its traditional ways and faiths by an alien and largely Third World religion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Beck&rsquo;s event was tepid {snip} a call to sink to the knees rather than rise from them. {snip} but the overall effect was large, vague, moist, and undirected: the Waterworld of white self-pity.</p>
<p>{snip} Well, the U.S. population is simply not going to be replenished by Puritan pilgrims from England, and the original Pledge of Allegiance was fine with most people as a statement of national unity, until its &#8220;original intent&#8221; was compromised by a late insertion of the words &#8220;under God&#8221; in the McCarthyite 1950s. But one still sees what she means and can feel sympathy with the pulse of nostalgia.</p>
<p>In a rather curious and confused way, some white people are starting almost to think like a minority, even like a persecuted one. {snip} The clue, surely, is furnished by the remainder of the speeches, which deny racial feeling so monotonously and vehemently as to draw attention.</p>
<p>Concerns of this kind are not confined to the Tea Party belt. Late professors Arthur Schlesinger and Samuel Huntington both published books expressing misgivings about, respectively, multiculturalism and rapid demographic change. But these were phrased so carefully as almost to avoid starting the argument they flirted with. More recently, almost every European country has seen the emergence of populist parties that call upon nativism and give vent to the idea that the majority population now feels itself unwelcome in its own country. The ugliness of Islamic fundamentalism in particular has given energy and direction to such movements. It will be astonishing if the United States is not faced, in the very near future, with a similar phenomenon. Quite a lot will depend on what kind of politicians emerge to put themselves at the head of it. Saturday&rsquo;s rally was quite largely confined to expressions of pathos and insecurity, voiced in a sickly and pious tone. The emotions that underlay it, however, may not be uttered that way indefinitely.<br>

<p>This is how I see it going, and it&rsquo;s impossible to be optimistic.<br>
I hate to say it, but our best hope is some type of calamity or natural disaster. Barring that, the long term forcast for whites isn&rsquo;t good.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;restoring honor&rdquo; is similar to the &#8220;change&#8221; vomited out by Obama   &mdash;   it is one of those vague phrases that are, in reality meaningless, but which creates a warm and fuzzy feeling in each  person who hears the phrase.  It is an old political trick, similar to saying that you are for &#8220;freedom &amp; democracy,&#8221; families, jobs, or education, and against waste and crime.  Whenever you hear a politician blurt out such empty phrases, you know they have no substance behind them.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck is whirling around at the speed of sound, in all directions and in no direction.  It is all show, with no real substance.</p>

		<p>Sharpie told O&rsquo;Reilly that Beck would start to lose his audience because of the MLK mania.  He&rsquo;s right.  I&rsquo;m off Beck, and I&rsquo;m the epitome of White Humanity&rsquo;s Conservative Right.</p>
<p>Beck is pretty good when reporting on Obama&rsquo;s corruption, but he shows just how far he has to go in understanding the source of that corruption when he worships MLK as our National Savior.</p>
<p>Next, he&rsquo;ll be telling us that we can&rsquo;t be Christians unless we worry about the Holocaust as much as the Jews do.</p>
<p>Transcend Beck, Escape MLK- read Savitri Devi (Pilgrimage, Defiance, and Lightening and the Sun), William Gayley Simpson (Which Way Western Man), and Revilo Oliver (America&rsquo;s Decline).</p>
<p>Share the Gospel Liberation with your neighbors. Build strong White Communities.  Prepare for what&rsquo;s coming&hellip; you know it&rsquo;s on the way&hellip; and will be very bad&hellip; how will you explain it to your White Children?<br>

		<p>Glenn Beck loves Martin Lucifer King. Even if Beck opposes affirmative action, anyone who wraps himself around the licentous Rev King is a John, not a Glenn.</p>
<p>I also respect and admire religious conservatives. But I don&rsquo;t believe in the Jewish,Christian or certainly Muslim God whol allegedly gets involved in petty human affairs. Mr. Beck has annointed himself as the new Billy Graham. Rev Graham never pontificated publically at least on politics. I don&rsquo;t want anyone to tell me how God would vote, support or endorse.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck has done well to deal with his substance abuse addictions. Kudos to him for that. But his reasoning on politics is convoluted, incredibly boring with his endless televised lectures. He totally ignores the cultural threat that immigration and education policy pose to European American life. </p>

		<p>I kinda of hoped Beck was more clever than I thought but he isn&rsquo;t.  The whole weekend boondoggle combined with his apology to Obama for calling him a racist (what is next, apologizing for saying 2 + 2 = 4?) just proves he is a cry-baby with no real racial or Christian pride.  I have his radio show on in the morning and all he does is worship MLK. Another fake, phony, fraud as an old time radio announcer used to say<br>

		<p>What James Edwards writes is absolutely correct.  We&rsquo;re not going to accomplish a gosh darn thing unless and until we stop this confounded groveling and pandering.  Beck and Palin are nothing but shills of a government gone crazy and a society about to implode into a fiscal depression.  Their goal seems to be to hijack the Tea Party movement and lead it in the direction that their &#8220;masters&#8221; want it to go.  These deluded people have got to get their heads out of the sand.  They&rsquo;re misleading the masses and catering to their media-caused delusions of some utopian multicultural society where everyone is &#8220;happy to be me&#8221;.</p>

		<p> An excellent article(the first one). In the past I&rsquo;ve found myself often agreeing with Beck but this rally shows me who he really is. An ineffectual, clueless big mouth that hasn&rsquo;t a single workable idea and lives in some kind of pseudo-christian fantasy land.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t need G.Beck to call a rally to &#8220;restore my honor&#8221;. I never lost it nor would I let anyone take it from me. Now, if somebody wants to call out the media, politicians, power structure players and federal government on the lies and myths they keep trying to shove down my throat, then I&rsquo;ll be there. With bells on. You know, kinda like what Gov. Brewer is trying to do in Arizona. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t waste my time. There are plenty of other nincompoops in the media doing that daily.</p>

		<p>From what I saw on t.v., this rally was nothing more than MLK day. What a disappointment. The way it was built up I thought it was going to be like in 20 trs. saying - &#8220;where were you at 8\28\10 when Beck had his rally?&#8221;, like people do with the JFK assasination. Instead I saw black speakers [ MlKs niece for Gods sake ] and singers praising MLK. How many WHITE speakers\singers were at Al $harptons rally? I bet alot of people that drove a long way and spent alot of money to be there, left feeling as if they&rsquo;d been had, which they were. </p>

<p>So TRUE!  I will wager not one single White in that crowd even know what our WHITE Founding Fathers were about, they also think that all &#8220;faiths&#8221;, all races and cultures made this country what it was meant to be.. Beck is leading White America down the wrong path. Instead of the yellow brick road he is leading them down the road to oblivion. Same goes for the Tea Party. They protest big government and high taxes, yet they can&rsquo;t see that blacks, immigrants and illegals are the reason why our taxes are going through the roof?  Oh no, that would be &#8220;racist&#8221;. They are all fools.</p>

		<p>No one knows what will happen if whites become a minority in the United States.  When white blue collar workers became a Republican constituency in the 1970&rsquo;s the Republican Party began a domination of the United States that persists.  Asians may become the next cross over to the GOP.  What is at least as likely is that as the percentage of Americans who are white declines, the percentage of whites who vote Republican will increase.<br>
 <br>
At any rate, the Democrats cannot win back the white working class and parts of the South by promoting open borders.  </p>

		<p>Eh&hellip;call me unconvinced. One thing that obscures all of the analyses of the 8/28 rally is that the purpose was so fuzzy. But really, even if it didn&rsquo;t advance the ball, I&rsquo;d hardly call it a &#8220;death rattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much as I&rsquo;m loath to quote RedState, I found this observation to be spot on:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Beck took charge because eventually, someone had to report for duty and no one else was willing <b>or able.</b> He&rsquo;s Bucky &ldquo;Bleeping&rdquo; Dent at bat in Fenway Park&hellip;Beck may not be my ideal of a leader, but he correctly identified an evil state of affairs and attacked it.&#8221;</i> [emphasis mine]</p>
<p>Please, let us not be such dead-enders as to ignore the fact Beck&rsquo;s rally was a show of opposition to the current state of rot, and one that got noticed by the powers in charge.</p>

		<p>Okay well after this article I feel sad. But still, Glen Beck may have groveled but the cause still got a lot of participants. We can&rsquo;t be so ultra-critical (even though in this case yeah&hellip;a King niece? Groveling).</p>
<p>Fact is when war hits and it gets ugly, and you are desperate for troops/recruits, you don&rsquo;t start overanalyzing. I do believe many of those that showed up have good honest hearts and that is what is important.</p>

		<p>I think Beck made a shrewd move to try and solidify the Tea Party movement and conservatives for the November elections by parading around a bunch of &#8220;diverse&#8221; people and talking about civil rights and other more liberal topics of conversation.  </p>
<p>The real goal was for conservatives not to be seen as a bunch of racists but instead, people who have a genuine concern for the direction of the country and who are trying to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Face it, the U.S. as we used to think about it or know it back in the early 1900&rsquo;s is over.  The current white realist movement or nationalist movement or whatever you want to call it, isn&rsquo;t large enough or strong enough to have any real influence in shaping American policies.  About the only thing that can change that is a major economic collapse or war, similar to what happened in Germany, post WWI.</p>
<p>So, instead of being totally overrun by a liberal agenda, perhaps some true conservative principles can be brought back into the fold, even if those principles have been watered down with diversity.</p>

		<p>Hitchens is and always was a creep. He is part of the problem.<br>
His assertion that &#8220;Under God&#8221; phrase was inserted by McCarthy<br>
as part of 50s paranoia is typical of him. In America political<br>
rallies, Cabinet meetings, sessions of Congress, trials in court<br>
all began with an Invocation to God..and that God was Christian.<br>
Sorry Hitch, but putting &#8220;Under God&#8221; into the Pledge of Allegiance wasnt some sneaky act..and no one thought of it<br>
as &#8220;coercive&#8221; until a generation of creeps like you came along<br>
to make a career out of &#8220;controversy&#8221; on the talk show circuit.</p>

		<p>   I watch Glenn some . I&rsquo;ve seen all the old, good movies . Most of the new ones stink . Nearly every thing on the educational networks is hopelessly liberally biased . Even the the weather channel wants to preach to me a liberal agenda . So, you watch FOX out of desperation . I had decided last week that Glenn had apparently lost his mind . The nation is gone . The only thing keeping our heads above the waters of complete madness is technology and I fear soon, that will not be enough . Something big is coming our way and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going be very pleasant . </p>

		<p>Oh thank goodness!! To hear some supposedly hard-right websites/blogs tell it, this mushy, hyper-religious foolishness Beck and his followers engaged in this past weekend was actually somehow &#8220;pro-white&#8221; and, for some reason I&rsquo;ve yet to to discern in the slightest, actually beneficial to our cause??? No really&hellip;praising ML King and howling about the evils of &#8220;racism&#8221; are, according to some it would seem, good for the pro-white cause!?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll grant, the hysterical idiocy the left and the media engage in over events like this probabaly IS good for our broader message - but only by accident and incidentally speaking. </p>
<p>Thank goodness for a little straight common-sense on this matter! </p>

		<p>My elderly mother is quite a Glenn Beck fan, and I sometimes try to tell her that he is really not as intelligent and insightful as she thinks he is.</p>
<p>In my case, I have listened to him on the radio and television several times and he seems a likeable guy. He&rsquo;s a smooth conversationalist, and while you wouldn&rsquo;t want to have a beer with him, at least a coke would be fine.</p>
<p>But essentially he is a religious type. He could easily be an evangelical preacher, of the type California used to produce for the megachurches, the Schuller type. So essentially Beck believes that &#8220;this is a nation of laws, not of men,&#8221; and that in addition the spiritual component, going back to the founding fathers, is necessary. But that being said, as long as the belief in the Constitution and states&rsquo; rights is met with the belief in God, he thinks the United States will do just fine, even if in several more decades we&rsquo;re a mostly mixed race group of what-have-you and what few whites are left are a deracinated minority.</p>

The race baiters have also convinced many of them to feel guilty for working hard and making their lives better.

		<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t believe race-realist conservatives should be intimidated by accusations of racism (i.e. race hatred), but I think it&rsquo;s also okay to deny that some action is one stemming from racial hatred or exclusion if it is not.  Whatever Beck&rsquo;s motives were, it remains a fact that black folks were allowed to attend the meeting and did.  I&rsquo;ve listened to coverage of the event from both right and left, and I&rsquo;ve yet to hear a single hint of accusation of anything but decent treatment for non-whites present.  The cultural lefties have been left flat-footed and are either muttering impotently or raging like lunatics. <br>
They&rsquo;re faced with the prospect of making an attack on God and patriotism, both of which most on the far left know nothing about. They told the world there would be racist attacks and senseless violence, yet the whole affair turned out to be an enormous turnout of polite, orderly people who picked up their trash and went quietly on their way. <br>

		<p>This pseudo-conservative-kumabaya event was a non-starter, not likely to make a bit of difference as long as Whites are not racially self-conscious. Just as the Million Man March was intended to solidify blacks and encourage responsibility and dignity and honor, the Beck rally was supposed to get us to look to God for the answers to our problems. Both events were nothing more than media-hyped photo-ops. THE PROBLEMS ARE IN WASHINGTON, AND TO TAKE BACK AMERICA WE NEED TO THROW THE BUMS OUT!!!</p>

<p>What was their goal? To complain about high taxes? The Tea party seems to have sprung up just from regular, perhaps paid, political activists. Do I have it wrong and there is a Ron Paul element to the Tea Party? Liberals, and Obama in particular, always seem to have to &#8216;overcome&rsquo;. When Obama turns the economy around looking like a miracle worker (right on cue) the same way Ronald Reagan turned the economy around 24 years earlier, the leftists will have very little opposition in front of them. And this time, as opposed to the Reagan presidency, the miracle worker won&rsquo;t have the media and school systems in opposition to him, only the (presumably) discredited voices angry about nothing and with no real issue whatsoever. <br>

		<p>#14 <i>What is at least as likely is that as the percentage of Americans who are white declines, the percentage of whites who vote Republican will increase.</i></p>
<p>That has been the pattern over the last few decades, and may be one of the reasons the corrupt Republican leadership never opposed immigration and other racial programs of the left - it drove whites into their arms.  The victims of the so-called &#8220;Southern Strategy&#8221;, to the degree it existed at all, weren&rsquo;t black, they were white.   The Republicans have played a very nasty game of  hinting to the white middle class and below that they will defend their cultural interests when in fact they couldn&rsquo;t care less about those interests (as this rally shows) and hold their supporters in contempt.  But the game had a time limit and it&rsquo;s just about up.   You can sense the Republican leadership shifting the strategy,  actually longing for the day when all that culture stuff is swept away and we can get to pure economic politics which they think they can win in the face of Liberal economic illiteracy.  That&rsquo;s uncertain.  They think they can win Hispanics over economics once the white problem has been settled, and whites too.  They really don&rsquo;t care if traditional America disappears, they&rsquo;re in it for the money.  Which brings us to white voters in the future.  There&rsquo;ll come a time in the future when whites not only realize that the Republican Party won&rsquo;t stand up for nation,  but that there is nothing left of that nation to stand up for.  Once that reality sinks in the Republicans will have to gain their votes by convincing them that the Republican program of tax breaks and other bennies for the rich will &#8220;raise all boats.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s going to be a hard sell.  The ethnic  votes will make the Republicans perennial losers anyway,  so why waste your vote?  The white middle class and below will join the might as well grab the cash now crowd, or just quit voting.  The Republican plan rests entirely on hoping for recurring Democratic fiascoes, but there comes a point when you can no longer recover from such fiascoes, and at that point we&rsquo;ll have our Chavez.    <br>

The Republican Party exists in order to advance the economic interests of the richest ten percent of the country.  A high rate of immigration raises prices, lowers wages, and consequently raises profits.<br>

In his book &#8220;What is the Matter With Kansas?&#8221; Thomas Frank said Republicans love to lose on social issues because such defeats anger lower income whites and strengthen their support for the GOP.  </p>

		<p>Fear not.  America will inevitably shift to race based politics.  The trick for white people then is to forge a single white American nation to present a stronger voice to the opposition.  The bad tendency will be for whites to schism along left-right ideological lines.  The former scenario is definitely the hoped for preference.  The latter is certain doom.</p>

<p>Well, you may just get your wish.  A day or so ago, on DRUDGE, was an article from BuffaloNews.com styled &#8216;UB professor predicts House will go to Republicans&rsquo;.  By Robert J. McCarthy.  The interviewee was a Professor James E. Campbell.  I read the headline on DRUDGE but skipped on without read the link.  Much later I did read the link.</p>
<p>What was interesting to me was at the end of the article.  It quotes Prof. Campbell saying &#8220;There is still an outside chance the Democrats could hold on&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, called such &#8220;formulaic modeling more academic than practical&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The events that will influence the midterm election have not yet occurred,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Anybody who believes the status quo was sustainable is kidding themselves&#8221;.  &#8220;</p>
<p>Lets see,,,we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of banks belly up.</p>
<p>We have 100,000s and 100,000s and 100,000s of homes in foreclosure.</p>
<p>We have millions and millions and millions of people unemployed.</p>
<p>We have Beck and Limbaugh and Jones and all the others.  We have Amren, RedState, Politico and all the rest.  All of these have already occurred.</p>
<p>Just what &#8216;events&rsquo; (plural) is Rep. Higgins talking about.  I would guess at least one is to &#8216;occur&rsquo; in New York State.  Maybe all &#8216;events&rsquo; are to occur there?</p>
<p>&#8220;The events that will influence the midterm election have not yet occurred&#8221;.  I guess we can only sit back, wait and watch and see what happens.</p>

		<p> For years many of us here have lamented the lack of awareness and involvement of whites in causes vital to them. &#8220;No one listens,&#8221; &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to get our message out,&#8221; &#8220;There&rsquo;s so few of us left,&#8221; &#8220;No one&rsquo;s willing to stand up,&#8221; they whine. </p>
<p>Well, Tea Partiers, if that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re called, (another example of the liberal media belittling and demeaning white Americans&rsquo; worth) try to make efforts to organize in groups all across this country in an effort to gain some inroads into issues that are at least a STEP toward getting our country back from EVERYONE who is hijacking it. These hijackers include blacks, illegals, foreigners, along with dimwitted, brainwashed, and greedy whites. Like myself, most Americans that I talk to want our corrupt government, entitlements, problems in public education, (much of which is due to the unfair favored status of blacks &amp; immigrants - both legal and illegal), turned back over to people with a sense of justice, fairness and common sense in the same way this country was founded. If &#8216;fairness&rsquo; and &#8216;justice&rsquo; were applied to our government as they should be (and they used to be) many –of course, not all–of the problems we have with blacks and other non-whites would decrease substantially. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be at least a step, at least an improvement? One has to begin somewhere. Yet some AmRen posters ridicule the &#8216;brainless&rsquo; and &#8216;traitorous whites&rsquo; trying in the only ways they know how to actually do something to call attention to their desires to better their lives; to demand a halt to being forced to kowtow to and subsidize the lowlifes we currently do. Would these posters prefer whites to sit on their hands meekly as they have been? Is it a perfect answer? Of course not. Is Glenn Beck the only person who can incite whites? Lord, I hope not. Is it at least an attempt? Yes. Is it too little, too late? Very possibly. Do I worship or blindly follow Beck, or even agree with everything he says? Absolutely not. Was his rally watered down, redirected and rambling after the unsurprising uproar by blacks and the media for &#8216;stealing their day&rsquo; and their &#8216;pulpit&rsquo;? Obviously. Like it or not, it HAD to be to fly by the censors, especially after hearing the last-minute, guaranteed-to-work racist flack from the poverty pimps -  whether it was Beck or Joe Blow heading it up. Intelligent white people know this and there is a definite undercurrent of what we know as the real truth hidden in all these gatherings, even if it is almost a &#8216;don&rsquo;t ask don&rsquo;t tell&rsquo; policy: that the &#8220;Tea Parties&#8221; represent primarliy white interests. I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the bits I heard from the rally, either. What I WAS happy about is the number of people (albeit likely disappointed people) who attended. </p>
<p>SO - does anyone here who is degrading the &#8216;white traitors&rsquo; who attended the rally have a better idea that will WORK? No? Another spokesman in mind that the entire country WILL rally around and every single white agrees with on every belief or opinion? Well? One that so many won&rsquo;t write off as a puppet or kook? I don&rsquo;t see  many stepping forward. Show me that person and I will get behind him wholeheartedly. Those that do step forward seem to get slammed, even by many of those who post here.</p>
<p>The indoctrination of our society is so well under way that I honestly don&rsquo;t know if there are enough of US as opposed to THEM anymore. But fragmenting the white population is a sure-fire method of guaranteeing we lose. Lately it sounds to me from this board that some current posters wouldn&rsquo;t even be satisfied if they could totally eliminate blacks and other non-white races altogether - they would just as soon wipe out the whites that don&rsquo;t agree with them on every item along the way. Black/white relations (or wanting freedom FROM them as they stand now) is positively one intrinsic component of the massive problems killing our country. But it&rsquo;s not the only problem that needs solving, and America&rsquo;s problems are primarily white&rsquo;s problems - the protected minorities are doing just fine, thanks to us. If your only idea of standing up; your only idea of &#8216;curing&rsquo; this country is to pronounce death to all blacks or ship them all back to Africa, good luck with that one. Hardly a realistic solution. If nothing less than that is acceptable to you, I dare say you&rsquo;re doomed to failure and a miserable &#8216;rest of your life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I detest the undeserved protected status that blacks have obtained in this country; the unfair advantages they are given, the dumbing down of the country due to an attempt to force blacks to succeed and the black crime rates. I deplore race mixing and the fallacy of a Utopian, one-world society. However, I detest white leeches on my tax dollars and white blowhards every bit as much as the black or brown ones. I despise unfairness, laziness, partiality, dependence, entitlements &amp; crime from any source. I have no more use for sorry white trash than I do trash of any hue. That&rsquo;s one thing that makes whites different than blacks - we don&rsquo;t defend the slime in our ranks as blacks will do. </p>
<p> I used to think most of us here were essentially on the same side. <br>

<p>Next time we&rsquo;ll have better speeches. That&rsquo;s all that needs to change. &#8220;</p>
<p>In what sense did anyone at this rally &#8220;speak out for white interests?&#8221;  If you read the text of the speeches, they did just the opposite   &mdash;   droning multiracialist boilerplate.</p>

		<p>This rally and the Tea Party in general, is hopefully only the first baby step on a long road.  The trick is to take another step, and another, and continue walking, then running.</p>
<p>Right now, there is no vision, no definition and no real unity to the white cause.  A leader is needed, and he needs to come from the grass roots.  Not the establishment.  And when that leader comes, he will emerge of his own accord.  First we need to deal with the secular/religious rift in white culture, and move forward from there.</p>

		<p>I do not need some money-hustling ex-junkie telling me to come back to god.  </p>
<p>[And, tho it sounds good, what exactly does that mean anyway?  He might as well advise us to love America, mother, and apple pie. Who&rsquo;s arguing?]</p>
<p>Do we need to take advice from someone like that? Who is he to be telling anyone anything?   </p>
<p>Good grief!  Out of 300 million people, is he the best we can produce? </p>
