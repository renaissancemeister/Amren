<h1>Education Secretary Urged His Employees to Attend Sharpton&rsquo;s Rally</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Gartner, Washington Examiner, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama&rsquo;s top education official urged government employees to attend a rally that the Rev. Al Sharpton organized to counter a larger conservative event on the Mall.</p>
<p>&#8220;ED staff are invited to join Secretary Arne Duncan, the Reverend Al Sharpton, and other leaders on Saturday, Aug. 28, for the &#8216;Reclaim the Dream&rsquo; rally and march,&#8221; began an internal e-mail sent to more than 4,000 employees of the Department of Education on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sharpton created the event after Glenn Beck announced a massive Tea Party &#8220;Restoring Honor&#8221; rally at the Lincoln Memorial, where King spoke in 1963.</p>
<p>The Washington Examiner learned of the e-mail from a Department of Education employee who felt uncomfortable with Duncan&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>Although the e-mail does not violate the Hatch Act, which forbids federal employees from participating in political campaigns, Education Department workers should feel uneasy, said David Boaz, executive vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sends a signal that activity on behalf of one side of a political debate is expected within a department. It&rsquo;s highly inappropriate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even in the absence of a direct threat,&#8221; Boaz said. &#8220;If we think of a Bush cabinet official sending an e-mail to civil servants asking them to attend a Glenn Beck rally, there would be a lot of outrage over that.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Arne Duncan, Prez Hussein&rsquo;s Ed Sec, and former pro Australian basketball player, Chicago political hack and all around white traitor, recently handed out three and a half billion bucks to the winners of the &#8220;Race to the Top&#8221; education &#8220;improvement&#8221; program to several lucky states. The states all swore on their mommy&rsquo;s graves to improve the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;. </p>
<p>They also will fire teachers who don&rsquo;t cause improvements in standardized testing of our fine public school students. Of course we are reaching the point where most public school students are black or Hispanic. Eventually all states will cave in to this bribery.</p>
<p>Ask Arne/Hussein to support private schools, religious schools or homeschooling, and they will look at you as though you are a very bad person. </p>
<p>You will be expelled.</p>
<p>When will the GOP try to stop ALL federal funding for local public schools?</p>
<p>Never.</p>

		<p>The fact that many black people still accept Sharpton in any  kind of leadership role shows how low their standards are.  The man is a proven, unrepentant fraud, a man without honor, and a shameless huckster.  The media deserves contempt for giving him so much attention as well.</p>

		<p>This incident is an example of what we all know   &mdash;   95% of all black Americans are against the Tea Party&rsquo;s conservative agenda of limited government and balanced budgets.  This is not surprising because most blacks think that the purpose of government is to take stuff from white people and give it to them, whether in the form of welfare payments, affirmative action jobs, or various other racial set asides, such as radio stations that can only be owned by blacks.</p>
<p>Despite this Glenn Beck and most of the Tea Party leadership keep wasting their time lauding Martin Luther King and various obscure blacks who were Republicans 100 years ago, rather than addressing the real issues that concern the Tea Party.  Beck and the other leaders are wasting their time   &mdash;   they will be called racist no matter what they do.<br>

		<p>The divisions between the private sector, the races and those whose livelihood depend on the income from  all levels of government widens. This Arne Duncan should be fired, and certainly not just asked to resign.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous (comment #2 above) has actually provided an excellent description of Martin Luther King (not his real name  &mdash;  more fraud), and also Je$$e Jack$on, in addition to $harpton.  King, Jack$on, and $harpton were and are media creations.  Without media glorification and support they all would have withered, dried up, and blown away years ago.</p>

<p>Can you believe it?  I have never, not ever in my life ever had a white kid in my classroom.  I&rsquo;ve been teaching for 20 years here on the east coast and all students I have ever had have come from latino or asian immigrant and/or black families.</p>
<p>They really do come after the teachers if little Shaniqua and Pedro aren&rsquo;t learning.  I really feel sorry for those teachers who get a class full of IEP&rsquo;s (really slow kids) because that can end your career.  I myself have gotten myself out of critical classes and teach all those little side subjects that no one cares about, and life is good.  Everyone passes!</p>
