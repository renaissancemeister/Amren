<h1>Small Town Steps In Because Feds Are &#8220;Failing on Immigration&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lexi Stemple, Fox News, August 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona is not alone in its fight for immigration reform. A lot of localities are stepping in where they feel the federal government is failing. One such town, Summerville, South Carolina, has just tentatively passed an ordinance that bans illegal immigrants from working and living there.</p>
<p>Walter Bailey, the town council member who proposed the ordinance tells Fox News the town needs to &#8220;send the message to Washington on immigration reform.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The federal government that should be regulating immigration at our borders but has dropped the ball for whatever reason and somebody has to pick up the slack.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ordinance won temporary approval earlier this week when the council voted 4-2 in favor of it. But an ACLU spokesperson says the ordinance violates housing laws and warns there are constitutionality issues with the ordinance. She warned the council during its hearing this week that a lawsuit is inevitable and other towns like this have spent a lot of money defending ordinances like this one.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ordinance is up for final approval next month.<br>

<p><br>
The correct term is threatened, not warned.  Because the exact same person trying to manipulate them into giving up without a fight is the one intending to inflict the lawsuits in the first place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple matter really.  Don&rsquo;t show up in court.  Don&rsquo;t obey whatever the court decides.  Do arrest anyone who comes to town with any intention whatsoever of &#8220;enforcing&#8221; the &#8220;law&#8221; (the US currently is a lawless country, actually, where &#8220;the law&#8221; says whatever it is our fascist rulers say it does, no matter how much it obviously does not).</p>
<p>My point is their is no mechanism for enforcement.  No jackbooted thugs (or at least no where near enough jackbooted thugs) to penalize a whole town that simply ignores the court.</p>
<p>And that is the solution in a nut shell.  Ignore the federal government, lock stock and barrel.  Pay no taxes.  Shut down the federal courthouse.  Ignore any rhetoric.  Jail anyone who shows up with a mind to do anything.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t handle a single town doing this.  What would happen if most of the nation did this?</p>

		<p>Yet another example of the ACLU threatening a municipality with extortion and racketeering&hellip;.which they can do, where it is only a few municipalities. But when it is tens of thousands of municipalities in the USA, the ACLU would quickly run out of money to pay lawyers nationwide. Not even their deep pockets are full enough to sue everybody.<br>

<p>Where are the lawyers and the ACLU in almost every major city in the country - where this is also happening? Once non-whites become a majority, they quickly pass laws mandating all city employees and contractors who work with the city must reside within city limits. The unstated goal is to restrict white employment in favor of prospects for non-whites. People of color have a &#8216;diversity&rsquo; program, too - by which they mean even more people who look and think the way they do up to the point where there are few if no whites in the organization at all. This allows even more freedom to celebrate &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Freedom loving, patriotic Americans are just going to have to refuse to go to court.  Don&rsquo;t allow them to bankrupt us.</p>
<p>The elected officials will have to back up this civil disobedience if we are to have any hope of winning this battle.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand what the ACLU is saying here. For that matter, I don&rsquo;t really understand the need for this law in the first place. Isn&rsquo;t it already illegal for illegal aliens to live and work here? And how can housing laws and the Constitution apply to people who are not only non-citizens, they&rsquo;re not even legal residents of this country. They&rsquo;re here illegally. They have no civil rights. Am I wrong on this? This whole illegal aliens issue is puzzling mr because it seems axiomatic to me that anyone in this country illegally is, in fact, a criminal; doesn&rsquo;t anyone care about that? What has happened to our national sovereignty and right to determine and uphold our own laws?  </p>

<p>THIS! is the club that is gonna be used to beat down American towns (as opposed to black populated big cities) trying to keep ILLEGAL ALIENS out. Like poker, a man at the table with $100,000 and table stakes, can beat a man who has $50 no matter the hand, just keep raising the pot! works every time.</p>

		<p>Walter Bailey is one of the most stand-up, honorable men I have ever had the good fortune to know and work with.  During his service as the solicitor for South Carolina&rsquo;s First Judicial Circuit he put more violent criminals on death row than anyone else.  It is nice to see him continue to stand up for his principles and his country as a town council member.</p>

		<p>This is the piecemeal destruction of our country. The stats show mostly white, some blacks, and few Hispanics in this community. If the town loses, it loses it&rsquo;s future. Twenty to thirty years from now those undocumented aliens wanting to come in, along with the timorous minority there now, will own and boldly rule a third to one-half of what was once a typical American small town. This is exactly what happened to Chicago. And if it can happen to a big city&hellip;.</p>

<p>And so the Usual Suspects, already quaking in their Gucci boots at the terrifying prospect of White solidarity, make their veiled threats and scurry to their Marxist judges to nullify the peoples&rsquo; will. Their time is fading, and they know it.  But they won&rsquo;t go down quietly.<br>

		<p>When will the ACLU and SPLC realize that the Constitution and Bill or Rights belongs to CITIZENS, not illegal invaders?  I&rsquo;m sure these &#8216;housing laws&rsquo; only state that one cannot discriminate against someone based on their skin color, race, creed, or ethnic origin, not their citizenship.  People need to realize that there are more than just Mexican illegal immigrants; talk about a &#8216;stereotype&rsquo; sheesh.</p>

		<p>What is needed is a national boycott of corporations that support the ACLU and &#8220;La Raza&#8221; and any other traitorus organizations dedicated to the demographic overthrow of the United States.  La Raza has an agenda that they do not even bother to hide, the demographic &#8220;reconquista&#8221; of the Southwestern United Staes.  Their biggest contributors ?  The Ford Foundation and Ford Motors.  Henry is rolling over in his grave.</p>

		<p>Memphomaniac,</p>
<p>You are incorrect in thinking the ALCU doesn&rsquo;t have deep enough pockets to sue.</p>
<p>Their pockets are your pockets.</p>
<p>During the Ford administration groups like the ACLU were given the right to sue and, if they win, to be compensated by taxpayers&rsquo; dollars.</p>
<p>They have a great incentive to sue for anything they can and you are paying for it.</p>

Just come flat out and say &#8220;We&rsquo;re trying to rid our town of the multitudes of problems that have only existed since the influx of illegal aliens has begun destroying the community we had.&#8221; The heck with Washington or sending ANYone a message. Save yourselves. Period. Quit trying to show Washington anything - they have blinders on, and more importantly, don&rsquo;t give a tiny rat&rsquo;s patooty about the rest of us.</p>

<p>Really?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to ask her if the ACLU has unlimited funds to litigate several towns and cities.</p>
<p>When it comes to litigation costs, even if every corrupt ACLU <br>
abulance chaser worked for free they wouldn&rsquo;t have the TIME or the MONEY to fight the necessary court battles.</p>
<p>The ACLU, the ADL, and the SPLC, are three corrupt, criminal organizations that have to go by any means necessary as the situation deteriorates, right along with any George Soros criminal enterprises.  I really believe that they&rsquo;re just too dense to really know what the real world is all about and how much they&rsquo;re hated by millions and millions of people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had their perverted way for so many years they probably think they&rsquo;re indestructable.</p>

<p>I wonder where the ACLU gets its money because it seems that they can sue anyone at anytime anywhere in the nation.</p>
<p>Years ago the ACLU actually did some good work, then it got hijacked by illegal immigration and &#8216;social justice&rsquo;  sympathizers.</p>
