<h1>Does the Black Church Keep Black Women Single?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liane Membis, CNN, August 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Legs covered in skin-toned stockings, her skirt crisp to the knee, Patty Davis slips on the black heels she has shined for the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to look good in the Lord&rsquo;s house,&#8221; she says as she spritzes her neck with White Diamonds perfume and exits her black Lincoln Town Car.</p>
<p>Davis, 46, of Union City, Georgia, has attended African Methodist Episcopal churches since before she could crawl. She sits proudly in the pew every Sunday for service and is among the first to arrive for bible study each Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day is a blessed day for me,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Jesus is the No. 1 man in my life and any man who wants me must seek me through Him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unmarried Georgia native is a committed follower of the Christian faith, striving to live and breathe the gospel in her daily life. Yet, according to relationship advice columnist Deborrah Cooper, it is this devout style of belief and attachment to the black church that is keeping black women like Davis  &mdash;  single and lonely.</p>
<p><b>Clinging to the gospel</b></p>
<p>Cooper, a writer for the San Francisco Examiner, recently made claims on her blog SurvivingDating.com that predominantly black protestant churches, such as African Methodists, Pentecostal, and certain denominations of Evangelical and Baptist churches are the main reason black women are single. Cooper, who is black and says she is not strictly religious, argues that rigid beliefs constructed by the black church are blinding black women in their search for love.</p>
<p>{snip} [A] Yale University study found that 42 percent of African-American women in the United States were unmarried.</p>
<p>Big Miller Grove Missionary Baptist Church, a predominately African-American Baptist church in Atlanta, is holding a seminar on the question of faith&rsquo;s role in marital status on August 20.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black women are interpreting the scriptures too literally. They want a man to which they are &#8216;equally yoked&rsquo;  &mdash;  a man that goes to church five times a week and every Sunday just like they do,&#8221; Cooper said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they meet a black man that is not in church, they are automatically eliminated as a potential suitor. This is just limiting their dating pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>The traditional structure and dynamics of black churches, mostly led by black men, convey submissive attitudes to women, Cooper says, encouraging them to be patient  &mdash;  instead of getting up and going after what they want.</p>
<p>Nearly ninety percent of African-Americans express &#8220;certain belief in God&#8221; and 55 percent say they &#8220;interpret scripture literally,&#8221; according to the 2009 Pew Research Center study &#8220;A Religious Portrait of African-Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>All in the numbers</b></p>
<p>One of biggest reasons black women are single, Cooper says, is because of a lack of black men in the church. According to the PEW study, &#8220;African-American men are significantly more likely than women to be unaffiliated with any religion (16 percent vs. 9 percent). Nearly one-in-five men say they have no formal religious affiliation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watkins believes the social structure of the church keeps black men from attending. &#8220;Those appealing, high-testosterone guys have a hard time getting into the &#8216;Follow the leader, give me your money, and listen to what I have to say&rsquo; attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The male pastor, Cooper says, is the &#8220;alpha male&#8221; for many black women. Over-reverence for the pastor  &mdash;  or any religious figure for that matter  &mdash;  creates barriers for the black man, she says, because he feels like he must compete for the No. 1 spot in a black woman&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t make you more attractive if your life is filled with these &#8216;other&rsquo; men,&#8221; Cooper says. &#8220;If they feel like they have to compete, you are not going to be interesting because you&rsquo;re not feeding his ego in the way it needs to be fed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rev. Renita J. Weems, a bible scholar who holds a degree in theology from Princeton, strongly disagrees with Cooper about why many black women remain single and says she is reinforcing one message: &#8220;It&rsquo;s the black woman&rsquo;s fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why black women who go to black churches are not married is because they are looking for certain values in a man,&#8221; Weems says. &#8220;It is not the church that keeps them single, but the simple fact that good values are lacking in some of our men.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Choose or lose the church</b></p>
<p>Cooper says her goal is to empower black women. If their strategy for meeting men is failing, Cooper offers two suggestions: Find another church or leave  &mdash;  and go where the boys go: tailgates, bars and clubs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black women need to open their eyes. You want to know the reason why the black man isn&rsquo;t in church? Because he left church to go to the Sunday football game,&#8221; Cooper says. {snip}</p>

<p>Translated into English, this means that one hustling scam artist recognizes another.</p>

<p>That line is more apt than the writer knows.  I have heard lots of stories that many black pastors of black churches get a lot of pleasures of the flesh.  Adam Clayton Powell (Jr.) was rumored to be such a black pastor, in his pre-Congressional days.</p>

		<p>No wait,<br>
it is the air. The racist air is the reason why black women are single. And the air has learned it&rsquo;s racism from white man.</p>
<p>I have read a lot of excuses and theories about why blacks are how blacks are. And they are getting more and more ridiculous just not to say the simple proven fact that they are different from us.</p>

		<p>Oh wow!  All these years I thought the main reason black women had a hard time finding husbands was because black men make the saddest excuses for life mates.  Now I know better: it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s fault!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the church that keeps them single, but the simple fact that good values are lacking in some of our men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some&#8221; of your men?  According to published statistics, 1/3 of black males are either currently incarcerated or have felony conviction records.  Assuming that for every one dumb enough to get caught you have one clever enough to slip through the cracks, you start to get a clearer picture of the &#8220;good values&#8221; of your typical black male.</p>
<p>In all fairness to black males, black women are no bargain, either.  This is something understood by the majority of people, if tacitly.</p>

		<p>I was all set to agree with these Black women, and then I thought, Well, how many of them have children? Even though they are unmarried, how many have children? Even though they profess righteousness, how many have children?</p>
<p>I am afraid that, as seems to be the case with many, many Blacks, they are talking a good game.</p>
<p>After all, &#8220;celibate&#8221; in Africa means simply &#8220;unmarried.&#8221; It does not mean that they abstain from sex, or do not have children.</p>
<p>Their values are not ours, even if they try to put them under the Christian umbrella.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s add some truth serum to the statement:</p>
<p>Over-reverence for the pastor &mdash; or any religious figure for that matter &mdash; creates barriers for the black man, she says, because he feels like he must compete for the No. 1 spot in a black woman&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>The result is:</p>
<p>The sexual attractiveness of white women creates barriers for the black woman because she can&rsquo;t compete for a spot in a black man&rsquo;s libido.</p>

		<p>Black, black, black &hellip; that&rsquo;s all I ever hear from so-called black Christians, like the &#8220;reverends&#8221; Jeremiah Wright, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and friends. </p>
<p>I daily follow a half-dozen White pastors on the internet, and not one of those humble men refers to himself as &#8220;reverend&#8221; ever. I have never, ever heard one of them mention the color of his skin. These men keep the focus on Christianity. For being Christians, black-Christians don&rsquo;t focus much on Christ. They should instead call themselves &#8220;black-empowerment&#8221; fanatics. </p>
<p>Most importantly, you&rsquo;re not supposed to be going to Church to find a mate. It&rsquo;s not a singles bar, Shanaynay.</p>

		<p>Just think of it as another form of birth control. Actually, between the unattractiveness of many (certainly not all) of the women, the incarceration rates of the men, their preference for white women and the general dysfunctionality of everything black, it&rsquo;s a wonder they don&rsquo;t become extinct.</p>

		<p>Hank Hill, black males want white women.  White women are the most desired the world over.  Which is why East Asian women will get plastic surgery on their eyelids, nose, and shave down their cheek bones, dye their jet black hair lighter colors, wear light colored contacts and bleach their sallow skin.  Wearing a blonde weave is almost standard now for black female celebrities in America.  I could go on but you get the point of how non-white women emulate white women to look better.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons why black people rarely marry or have long-term relationships that I could write a book about it.  I will only mention a few.  Black people don&rsquo;t trust each other because black people will lie about anything including trivial things.  Black people have bad attitudes.  Black people don&rsquo;t like seeing other black people get ahead (crabs in a barrel mentality).  Black women have children young by thug black men.  But the most likely reason is genetics.  Early European explorers in Africa noted how black men would have sex with a woman, possibly impregnate her, then leave and have next to zero involvement with his children.</p>

<p>I am an Atheist, but not even I would blame either Jesus or the Church for African Americans&rsquo; 70% bastardy birthrate. If anything, their churches are about the only thing in black society preventing that 70% from spiralling up to near 100%. Despite my own lack of belief, this is one white Atheist who would LOVE to see blacks returning <i>en masse</i> to the pews of their (preferably segregated) houses of worship. </p>
<p>Provided, of course, they&rsquo;d be listening to a Reverend who actucally talks about the Bible, morality, etc   &mdash;   and not the &#8220;God damn America!&#8221; political propaganda of some race-hustling communist like the racist preacher of our racist president. </p>
<p>With or without the help of religion, Whites, Asians, and even most brown people have understood the importance of monogamous marriage not merely for centuries, but for MILLENNIA. We&rsquo;ve been doing the Holy Wedlock thing so long it&rsquo;s in our blood. For those same millennia, Subsaharan Africans practised total promiscuity and a sort of haphazrd communal child-rearing of the Hillary Clinton &#8220;It Takes a Village&#8221; school of (non-) thought. They weren&rsquo;t even familiar with the CONCEPT of marriage. </p>
<p>What all this means is: No persons of African descent anywhere on earth have a &#8220;racial memory&#8221; of marriage going back more than 400 years. All this monogamy stuff is alien to them. And they don&rsquo;t like it. Especially the males. </p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a choice between the Christian life and Thug Life, obviously it&rsquo;s better that blacks should live the Christian life. There&rsquo;ll be fewer dead white people that way. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope women like this Patty Davis find themselves decent black husbands who share their values. But as Poster #8 said, church is not supposed to be a singles bar in the first place; and believers who are genuinely faithful do not treat it as such. <br>

		<p>I sure wish that first sentence was representative of white women&rsquo;s attitudes at church, or at work.  I&rsquo;ve seen enough bare legs, flip flops, and/or sloppy Viet Cong black pajamas, even in the most supposedly formal occasions, to make me want to make a scene.  And I&rsquo;m fine with an anti-feminist message.</p>
<p>The saddest part of this story, though, is that perhaps black churches are contributing to dysgenic trends among blacks, the population that can least afford and sustain them.  Removing classy and conscientious, and presumably successful and relatively high IQ black women, from the gene pool by making them unattractive to black men (compared to a low-IQ woman of low morals) is a horrendously bad idea.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s black men and women who keep black women single. Black men do want to marry black women, they relentlessly harass, use, abuse, defile and violate white women instead. Black women all too often have a disposition like the Klingons out of Star Trek, which means that if black men don&rsquo;t want them, why should men of other races either? Blacks in general do not seem to even value monogamy the way whites do, even though I know black couples who have been married for thirty years or more. They are the minority compared to the young animalescents who act like rutting deer. I personally resent black men pursuing white women, many white men such as myself are single too in part because they are no white women for us. One who has kids by a black man as far as I&rsquo;m concerned is beyond undesirable to me, it&rsquo;s bad enough when they have kids by another man period. I don&rsquo;t blame black women for being angry about this, but they should try to do something to get their men to desire them and leave our women alone.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a flesh-and-blood saga of how some black women regard their black pastor as the number one man in their life.</p>
<p>Some years ago, the archbishop of Atlanta, GA named Eugene Marino (a black, despite his Italian name) married himself to a blackchurch secretary, in a secret ceremony. Naturally, he was ex-communicated from the Church by the pope, when it was exposed. In addition, this secretary also had an abortion, that was paid for by the Church. I don&rsquo;t recall if Marino was the one who impregnated her.</p>
