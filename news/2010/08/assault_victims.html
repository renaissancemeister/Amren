			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ruth Manuel-Logan, Black Voices, August 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Who is Antoine Dodson? Well, a few weeks ago he was just a young man from some run-down projects in the Lincoln Park area of Alabama, who lived with his parents, siblings, nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>Now, he has managed to move his entire clan out of the projects and in to a pretty cush life, after striking gold with an online video that went viral.</p>
<p>Dodson&rsquo;s overnight fame-to-fortune story began when his sister Kelly was attacked while sleeping with her young daughter by a would-be rapist. The attacker had apparently climbed on to the ledge outside Dodson&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s window, gained entry in to her bedroom and groped the young woman while she was asleep. Luckily, Dodson overheard the commotion and screams coming from his sister&rsquo;s room and jumped to her rescue. The two men scuffled and the assailant escaped. The child was unharmed.</p>
<p>The attack made the news and a local camera crew arranged to interview Dodson about the incident. {snip} In short, the interview was an attention-grabber, with Dodson&rsquo;s in-your-face, flamboyant words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wee-ell, obviously we have a rapist in Lincoln Park. He&rsquo;s climbing in your windows, he&rsquo;s snatching your people up, trying to rape them; so y&rsquo;all need to hide yo kids, hide yo wife and hide yo husband, because they&rsquo;re raping err&rsquo;body out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The intruder also left his T-shirt behind, and Dodson added the following warning to his angry diatribe:</p>
<p>&#8220;We got yo T-shirt, you left fingerprints and all, you are so dumb. You are really dumb, for real. You don&rsquo;t have to come and confess that you did it, we looking for you. We gon find you, I&rsquo;m letting you know that. So you can run and tell that. Homeboy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dodson&rsquo;s interview was caught by The Gregory Brothers {snip} [who] decided to transform the interview into a song and title it &#8220;Bed Intruder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The video went viral on YouTube overnight, with more than 30-million viewers watching the clip, propelling it to the No. 1 spot. The song&rsquo;s success hasn&rsquo;t stopped there, though.</p>
<p>This week, &#8220;Bed Intruder&#8221; debuted on Billboard&rsquo;s Hot 100 list at No. 89 from download sales. In addition, according to Billboard:</p>
<p>&#8220;It also debut[ed] on Hot Digital Songs at No. 49 with 30,000 downloads, according to Nielsen SoundScan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gregory Brothers agreed to split their profits 50/50 with Dodson {snip} and Dodson set up a Facebook page and an Antoine Dodson official website, asking people to &#8220;help the Dodson family&#8221; and donate via PayPal.</p>
<p>There are also merchandising deals brewing to coin Dodson&rsquo;s catchphrases, like, &#8220;Hide yo kids&#8221; and &#8220;We gon&rsquo; find you,&#8221; and even ringtones are in the works.</p>
<p>While the attacker who started this whole thing is still on the loose, Dodson had a few choice words for him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty much, I&rsquo;ma beat his a** and then I&rsquo;ma call the police while I&rsquo;m beating his a** because I want him to feel what he made my sister feel when he came in to her room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good for him! Hope he doesn&rsquo;t blow the money on stupid things, but&hellip; we know how that usually goes. </p>

<p>I am not really sure why this video and article is on AR&lsquo;s website? Even the remarks under the article: &ldquo;21st-century Horatio Alger story,&rdquo; are somewhat silly.</p>
<p>Look, I understand that blacks can be quite violent and vulgar and certainly this young man is. To say nothing of, wretchedly ignorant and most likely a feckless street thug. However, his actions in protecting his sister and her child do not deserve ridicule or rancor; moreover, if he gains some money and fame from the incident, I say dine out on it Antoine!</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t want him doing such in my neighborhood, but hypocrisy isn&rsquo;t hypocrisy, if you admit it from the get-go,</p>

		<p>Ain&rsquo;t America great?  A guy who would be just as likely to be climbing in YOUR window some night for robbery or worse, gets to hit a jackpot and wins fame due to the  clueless 30 and under crowd cheering on his ghetto-ese.  Just great.  I wonder how many dupes are actually donating to his Paypal account?  I guarantee they are all vanilla and not chocolate.</p>

		<p>For every idiot donating a dollar to this guy, ten are waking up because of him.</p>
<p>That is the point&hellip;.and the only reason this clip has gone viral in the first place.  If it was a well dressed, well spoken man of any race saying the same things it would be ignored.</p>
<p>It is the fact that he IS the type of guy you would worry about doing the same exact crime that draws attention to the incident in the first place.</p>

		<p>Hmmmmm&hellip;. Sounds like this assault on his sister was the best thing to happen to the whole family. Indirectly of course.</p>

		<p>What I see here is a heroic young man being turned into a media whore because of all of the undue attention being lavished on him. The statements he is making are becoming more and more outrageous because others are egging him on. </p>
<p>Rather than asking why so much crime and violence exist in the black community (and I mean asking this HONESTLY), these people are glorifying the very violence they claim to be discouraging. </p>
<p>Now Dodson is implying that he wants to engage in vigilante action, which would  just be &#8220;perpetuating the cycle of violence,&#8221; to use liberal-speak. Dodson should be asking why the police haven&rsquo;t captured the would-be rapist rather than engaging in puerile fantasies about what he would like to do to him. Such fantasies, if acted upon, would just move Dodson from the &#8220;hero&#8221; category into the lawbreaker category.</p>

Mr. Dodson won the grand prize in a contest he didn&rsquo;t even know he was participating in. Big pay-off for the little to no work he didn&rsquo;t even realize he had done. Heck, I wish someone would shower me with money for something I said in passing. If only&hellip;</p>
<p>What I learned from this piece is that because of the auto-tune program, anyone can be a rap star. (According to online information, the auto-tune program was developed by Andy Hildebrand. I&rsquo;ll assume it was an advanced computer program developed by a white man).</p>
<p>I learned that two nerdy white guys can write a rap song that rivals that of any black rapper. I&rsquo;ve seen these guys work before when they auto-tuned politicians. They&rsquo;ve gotten very good at manipulating audio and video.</p>

<p>YOU think that this is catchy???  This is just more rap trash, even if it is about preventing or catching a rapist.  This isn&rsquo;t music, it isn&rsquo;t art, it&rsquo;s kids playing with computers and making rhymes on a 5 YO level.<br>

		<p>Ahh I know this is Amren and all, but that remixed song parody on youtube cracks me up. I can&rsquo;t belive they agreed to give the black homosexual lunatic 50 percent of the profits considering the news clip was in the public domain and they did 100 percent of the work. </p>
<p>Oh well, if you read this dudes, stop payment on those checks and hire a lawyer, an oral agreement giving some lout tons of your money for a news clip which he doesn&rsquo;t actually own the rights to really isn&rsquo;t exactly an enforceable contract! </p>

		<p>Oh, come on now. Some unknown thug tries to rape your sister in her own bed, next to her small child, you are going to feel like saying this exact same thing, whether you utter the words aloud or not. This young person expressed his feelings very clearly. I really see nothing wrong with that. That some silly white &#8220;mucisians&#8221; made a rap song of it is just a lucky accident and should not be held to his fault or credit. If the family can actually use the money from it to permanently better themselves, maybe it won&rsquo;t have been a total waste of hot air after all.</p>

		<p>   I&rsquo;m not buying it. The whole thing smells like a scam to get whitey to come up with some money for the bro&rsquo; and his family. This guy isn&rsquo;t a fighter. He and the Gregory brothers are scam artists.</p>
