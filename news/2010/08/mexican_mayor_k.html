<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38755444/ns/world_news-americas/">Mexican Mayor Kidnapped by Drug Hitmen Found Dead</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexican security forces found the body of a mayor near Mexico&rsquo;s northern industrial city of Monterrey on Wednesday after he was abducted by drug hitmen, according to reports.</p>
<p>Monterrey-based daily El Norte and local TV networks said Edelmiro Cavazos, mayor of the town Santiago on the outskirts of Monterrey, was found bound and dumped on a rural road.</p>
<p>Gunmen with automatic weapons burst into Cavazos&rsquo; home Sunday in Santiago, a colonial-era town that is a popular weekend destination, police and officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nuevo Leon Governor Rodrigo Medina said Cavazos was probably targeted for his efforts to clean up Santiago&rsquo;s corrupt police force.</p>
<p>The abduction follows a spike in violence over the weekend in northern Mexico, where rival gangs are battling for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes into the United States.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Cleaning the house&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the weekend, drug gangs set up over 40 roadblocks in Monterrey, parking trucks, cars and even an ambulance across roads in a bid to derail army anti-drug operations. Assailants also threw grenades at offices of Televisa, Mexico&rsquo;s biggest broadcaster in Monterrey and in Tamaulipas state to the east. No major injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, Monterrey and nearby towns like Santiago have been sucked into a bloody turf war between the Gulf cartel and a spin-off group called Zetas.</p>
<p>The surge in violence in Monterrey, Mexico&rsquo;s most affluent city and home to some of the country&rsquo;s biggest companies such as global cement maker Cemex, is a major worry as foreign companies question the safety of doing business there.</p>

		<p>where rival gangs are battling for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes into the United States</p>
<p>How many Americans understand that its our welfare dollars that make this lucrative.</p>
<p>Drugs are not a free market phenomenon.  They are not simply one more commodity with profit incentives.  In a free market, actually, their niche is actually quite small, historically.</p>
<p>So why is the drug business so large and powerful that its business murder mexican mayors with impunity?  Because of socialism.  Wealth is redistributed from the normal, productive person, to the drug crazed maniac.  Welfare, in all its forms, is evil to the core&hellip;.and has little results except this outcome.</p>
<p>Simply put, to solve the race issue, to solve the gang issue, to solve the immigrant issue, to solve the problem of our cities destroyed by non-whites and our people raped, murdered, assaulted and worse by non-whites&hellip;.all this can be done with only a simple change in every white nation.</p>
<p>Dismantle welfare in all its forms.  The poor (the LEGITIMATELY poor) will instantly see their standard of living raise.  While the drug empires will crumble.  They have no life or power of their own&hellip;.except for what we hand directly to them via welfare.</p>
<p>It really is as simple as no longer doing this.  I feel so strongly about this as to make a prediction that seems ridiculous on its surface.  Even in extreme places like South Africa, doing this would reverse the problem.  Even the majority population of non-whites can only do their evil deeds by way of welfare channeled into drugs.</p>

		<p>Mexico would be a slightly better place if they had the death penalty for some of the crimes that we have it for.But they think that they are morally superior to us because they dont have it. And because of that, their murder rate is 3 times ours.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before a politician on the US side is killed or kidnapped and killed.  These cartels are getting more powerful and bolder with each passing month.</p>
<p>When that happens, I&rsquo;m pretty sure this present anti-white administration will still find some kind of excuse not to militarize the border.</p>

		<p>Militarize the border, and, yes, legalization of marijuana wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing either. You can cut drug cartels profits by 60% plus create something to tax, along with all other products that can be made from hemp.</p>
<p>Conservatives need to realize that these two things will have to go hand in hand if we are to solve our biggest problem with Mexico. Gun rights and putting an end to the wasteful &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; are two issues where the Libertarians are 100% correct and just in their platform.   </p>

<p>There are a number of problems with your specious argument.  I shall attempt to address them.</p>
<p>1) If you dismantle welfare (by that I take it you mean Federally funded public assistance), then you must dismantle ALL forms of welfare.  Federally funded welfare programs began during the Great Depression.  Since the Clinton Administration, these programs are controlled by state goverments.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.welfareinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.welfareinfo.org/</a></p>
<p>In addition to dismantling programs like TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), food stamps, energy or utility assistance programs, etc., you would have to abolish Social Security, VA benefits, SSI, unemployment benefits, etc. because ALL of these programs fall under the heading of &#8220;welfare&#8221; and NONE of them were called for in the enumerated powers section (Article I, Section 8) of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Thus, by abolishing these programs outright, you would by fiat instantly create untold millions of people with no visible means of support.  Far from resolving the &#8220;race issue&#8221; and &#8220;the gang issue&#8221;, this act would in fact exacerbate them.  </p>
<p>Rampant poverty has been shown to trigger race riots as the dark-skinned, low-IQ &#8220;have nots&#8221; resort to criminality to enrich themselves at the expense of the light-skinned, high-IQ &#8220;haves&#8221; who naturally respond with organized aggression in order to defend themselves and their property.  While one of the purposes of this website is to show the high correlation between genetics and criminality (which it does admirably, by the way), even Jared Taylor I&rsquo;m sure will admit that poverty is nonetheless a significant factor in high crime rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/povertycrime.php" rel="nofollow">http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/povertycrime.php</a></p>
<p>I would like you to show me how suddenly throwing millions of LEGITIMATELY poor people to the wolves is going to raise their standard of living, especially since even eliminating the taxes that pay for welfare programs will not make American labor cheap enough to compete with places like China, India, Vietnam, etc.</p>
<p>Many are tempted to believe that gangsterism is a modern phenomenon, but even a cursory examination of American history shows that gangsterism (black and white) was a major problem in these United States in the days before social welfare programs and increased police powers.</p>
<p><a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2248/is_n118_v30/ai_17150109/" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2248/is_n118_v30/ai_17150109/</a></p>
<p>Drug abuse was rampant even before Prohibition.  Did you know, for example, at one time you could buy heroin (and syringes) from the Sears catalog?  It was openly sold without a Rx.</p>
<p><a href="http://opioids.com/heroin/heroinhistory.html" rel="nofollow">http://opioids.com/heroin/heroinhistory.html</a></p>
<p>Welfare programs did not create the drug empires, drug prohibition did, just as alcohol prohibition created the National Crime Syndicate.</p>
<p>The only REAL solutions to the drug problem are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Fortify our borders.</p>
<p>2) Expell illegal aliens (Eisenhower did it, so can we).</p>
<p>3) Arrest, try, convict and execute major drug traffickers living in this country.  Unleash the CIA on those living outside our borders.</p>
<p>4) Routinely audit banks (especially big banks) that are suspected of laundering drug money.  Oh yes, abolish the Fed.</p>
