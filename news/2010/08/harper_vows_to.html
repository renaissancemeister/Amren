<h1>Harper Vows to Toughen Laws As Tamils Zip Through Hearings</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marten Youssef and Daniel Leblanc, Globe and Mail (Toronto), August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The cries of a toddler echoed over a speakerphone in the windowless chambers of the Immigration and Refugee Board offices in downtown Vancouver, a momentary speed bump in the fast-track detention reviews being held for 492 Tamil migrants.</p>
<p>The brief interruption  &mdash;  cut short by the IRB adjudicator who asked the child be moved far from the phone  &mdash;  was the solitary disruption in a speedy process of conducting detention reviews for 92 migrants on Tuesday. None have been released from custody yet.</p>
<p>Facing an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; influx of refugee claimants, the IRB said it is piling on resources, including bringing in a retired adjudicator, to speed the hearings. So far, the board is far outpacing its record from the previous round of Tamil migrants, when it took four days to conduct reviews for 76 Tamil men.</p>
<p>This time, Ottawa is taking a tougher stand on illegal arrivals, with Prime Minister Stephen Harper Prime vowing to stop the flow of ship-borne migrants to Canadian shores, saying he will &#8220;not hesitate to strengthen the laws if we have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Canadians are pretty concerned when a whole boat of people comes  &mdash;  not through any normal application process, not through any normal arrival channel  &mdash;  and just simply lands,&#8221; Mr. Harper said at a news conference in Mississauga, Ont., on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Conservatives are striking a tougher tone after many Canadians expressed concerns over last week&rsquo;s arrival in B.C. of 492 Tamils on board the MV Sun Sea, with possibly other boats to follow.</p>
<p>Government officials said Canada will continue to abide by a 1985 Supreme Court ruling that guarantees Charter rights to refugee claimants, but insisted that domestic laws are being reviewed with the goal of deterring migrant ships. Mr. Harper said that Canada is a &#8220;land of refuge,&#8221; but he warned that the country will exercise its sovereignty and fight human smuggling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are responsible for the security of our borders, and the ability to welcome people, or not welcome people, when they come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ll take whatever steps are necessary going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Vancouver, all the adult migrants remain in custody. Children are not formally in custody, but are being housed with their mothers in detention facility in Burnaby, B.C. Men, women, and women with children are in separate facilities. None of the migrants have yet had their identities verified.</p>
<p>The IRB expects to go through 80 more detention reviews on Wednesday across the Lower Mainland. Tuesday&rsquo;s hearings included five conducted by phone for women with children.</p>
<p>The subject of the first hearing, however, was a young woman. The session lasted less than a half hour, with the woman responding only by shaking or nodding her head. The IRB heard she was on the Sun Sea with her parents and brother, who are also detained. Relatives in Toronto offered bond for her release, but the IRB refused.</p>
<p>Some of the migrants brought refugee cards, their national identification, passports, birth certificates and even family photos in an effort to prove their true identities, but Canada Border Services Agency has yet to verify those documents.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be ordering for your continued detention for the reason that your identity is not established,&#8221; Lee Ann King of the IRB told the woman.</p>
<p>Under immigration law, refugee claimants can be detained if they cannot be identified, might fail to appear for subsequent proceedings, or pose a security risk, or a danger to the public.</p>
<p>The female detainees  &mdash;  all dressed in green sweaters, grey sweat pants and sandals, and wearing handcuffs  &mdash;  said little more than yes or no yesterday, but many of them bowed when the judge read their names. One elderly woman tried to stifle her cough as not to disturb the proceedings. She examined the room, the roof, the chairs and occasionally smiled at the judge as a translator over a speaker phone helped her make sense of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the federal Liberals called on the government to show more compassion and to &#8220;lower the tone&#8221; on the possibility that some of the Tamil refugee claimants might be criminals or terrorists with links to the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.</p>
<p>NDP MP Paul Dewar said the government should focus on helping Sri Lanka to rebuild after a long civil war, instead of trying to block Tamils from entering Canada.<br>

		<p>It is fascism for the Prime Minister to say Canada is a &#8220;land of refuge&#8221;. He is imposing an identity on the country. He obviously intends to limit the democratic choices that Canadians can make. He is shutting down debate about what is an important policy decision. Actually Canada is a sovereign nation and can make immigration and refugee policies as it wishes. Our politicians should feel ethically bound to help Canadians make democratic choices. By taking the fascist approach, the PM is forcing a fight for power since it is those with power who get to impose their preferred version of identity on the country. </p>

<p>Why would they be concerned? If diversity is such a blessing   &mdash;   shouldn&rsquo;t an unexpected boat load be like an inheritance or winning the lottery? They should be celebrating, right? </p>

		<p>Harper will just keep on trying to buy ethnic votes. Note his disgusting &#8220;apology&#8221; to Sikhs when Canada denied entry to a ship of illegal alien Sikhs in 1914. Then Canadians had some racial awareness and weren&rsquo;t afraid to show it. As for Tamils they are the worst foreigners you could posibly have. Nothing but crime and welfare.</p>

		<p>Harper is just another traitor hoping to get elected with a majority by catering to the minorities in Canada.</p>
<p>He will soon find out that the gains in minority vote will be more than offset by the loss of white vote.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take whatever steps are necessary going forward.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Oh, I see. You&rsquo;re going to take steps &#8220;going forward&#8221;. In other words, you know people are pissed off so you just want to sweep it under the carpet by saying you&rsquo;ll do something <i>later</i>.</p>

<p>I think MP Dewar has his priorities backwards. Maybe he should run for office in Sri Lanka?<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, if you Canadians would just go and fix up every country in the world that has problems then you wouldn&rsquo;t have all these refugees.</p>

		<p>Sri Lanka is separated from the Indian subcontinent by a stretch of water about 15 miles wide. Southern India is populated by Tamils; they have a state of their own, Tamil Nadu; the Sri Lanka Tamils originally came from there, and the Indian Tamils helped the Sri Lanka Tamils during all the years of the civil war with money and weapons. If these Sri Lanka Tamils feel today prosecuted by the Sri Lanka government, why don&rsquo;t they seek asylum with their cousins and friends in Tamil Nadu? It would&rsquo;nt be necessary to make that 15000 mile voyage across the Pacific ocean.</p>

		<p>&#8220;492 &ldquo;refugees&rdquo; on the first boat; more to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fear not, my friends.  All of these &#8220;refugees&#8221; are to our advantage.  Their presence insures an unequivocval break up of this wretched empire.</p>
<p>Keeping them coming in the face of an economy in the beginning of a death spiral insures that break up will unquestionbably occur.  Jobs and social benefits are fazing out right now, and will be non-existent soon.</p>
<p>Overloading the country with unskilled workers is a recipe for large scale conflict.  Overpopulation straining rescourses in an already overburdened system only adds to an already impoissible situation.</p>
<p>They will soon be part of the ones who will be marching on the fools within the gated communities who thought they would always be safe.</p>

		<p>Yes of course if Canada lets these people in, they will bring all their relatives, then their relatives will bring their relatives and friends. Then whole communities will form, their numbers will grow. Then they&rsquo;ll be making all kinds of demands and complaining that Canada is &#8220;racist&#8221; for not doing enough for them and demanding change. Where have we seen this before.</p>

		<p>This is like 1987 all over again; when boatloads of Sikhs arrived illegally on Canadian shores.  The Mulroney government showed no backbone whatsoever.</p>
<p>The Liberals and the Nowhere Deadbeat Party, true to form, suggest &#8216;showing compassion&rsquo; for these illegal aliens.  Oh, but of course!  These illegals represent more potential Liberal votes at the polls.  How does it become Canada&rsquo;s responsibility to help clean up Sri Lanka&rsquo;s own civil unrest?  Isn&rsquo;t that the same approach that has given the American government a negative reputation around the world&hellip;by intervening in conflicts in other countries?</p>
<p>These are the same two political parties (along with the separatist Bloc Quebecois) who have repeatedly voted down every bill the Conservatives have introduced in Parliament to try and crack down on crime; just to give you an idea of the respective priorities of Canada&rsquo;s political parties.</p>
<p>If the arrival of these illegals is proof of anything; it&rsquo;s that Canada&rsquo;s reputation is that of a country that has become way too soft on illegal immigrants as well as on crime.</p>
<p>If Stephen Harper can show some backbone that few politicians do in this country, by sending these refugees back to their homeland, he just might have sent the message to the silent majority who are frustrated with the tail wagging the dog.  His reward could be a majority government.<br>
