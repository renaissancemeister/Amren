<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=195837">The New American Tribalism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Craige McMillan, WorldNetDaily, August 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The MacMillan dictionary defines tribalism as a) &#8220;a way of thinking or behaving in which people are more loyal to their tribe than to their friends, their country, or any other social group,&#8221; and b) &#8220;very strong loyalty that someone feels for the group they belong to, usually combined with the feeling of disliking all other groups or being different from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise in this for most Americans has been that the perpetrators of the new American tribalism have been the political left. This &#8220;we are the world&#8221; crowd who had &#8220;moved beyond&#8221; nationalism and borders have become the most vehement practitioners of the politics of exclusion and self-imagined superiority. Competing voices on how to solve America&rsquo;s growing list of critical problems are not only to be ignored  &mdash;  they are to be silenced! {snip}</p>
<p>Owning the nation&rsquo;s corrupt media is not enough for the new American tribalists  &mdash;  no other views can even be discussed! Loyalty to the tribe, and the nepotism and spoils that come with it, demands total and complete allegiance to the tribal agenda. Speak ill of your own tribe and you will rapidly become an outcast, {snip}.</p>
<p>In dollar terms the corruption, greed, tribal nepotism and lawlessness are unprecedented in American history. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent on tracking and surveillance technology to keep American citizens in line and bare every facet of their existence to a government gone mad. All the while, illegal aliens cross our borders at will, terrorize our populace, game our welfare system and claim medical care and citizenship for their offspring. Black-on-white voter intimidation goes unpunished, while the PC-rotted brains of government officials term an Islamist massacre at Fort Hood &#8220;workplace violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tribalism exhibited by the ruling class is beyond comprehension for most of us. But we&rsquo;d better figure it out, and soon! No less of an authority than the World Bank has blamed tribalism for Africa&rsquo;s hopelessness:</p>

<p>God, but that it were true!  Whites who speak ill of White Humanity always seem to shoot right to the top of government, media, academia, military, religion, all our institutions are filled and run by Whites who espouse hatred for Whites and love for the other tribes.</p>
<p>If you want career advancement, just learn to say, and say it without choking, that &#8220;we need to foster diversity and help minorities, and the best way to do that is atoning for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you say that, you keep to keep and increase your White privileges, but for how much longer.  All those blacks you give jobs to as an atonement will want your job, and since you will be outnumbered, you will be sacrificed to the god of the Diversity Curse.</p>

<p>Well, he lost me there.  I don&rsquo;t consider the World Bank to be an authority; they&rsquo;re part of the problem rather than an impartial arbitrator.  If the World Bank considers tribalism to be a fatal condition, why do they lend to tribal people?  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had one of these &#8216;leftist tribalists&rsquo; tell me that he &#8220;probably has more in common with a kid in Osaka than many of his neighbors&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Yet, when pressed, he didn&rsquo;t know anybody from Osaka, never associated with anybody from Osaka, and most of his friends were white and local.</p>
<p>The global village idiot lives in a virtual world. He thinks himself part of a global enlightened tribe, an exclusive club of snobs whose only entry requirement is a stated belief in &#8220;tolerance and diversity&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the global village idiot was to go abroad, he&rsquo;d find out very quickly all doors don&rsquo;t open automatically just because you&rsquo;re a white leftist.<br>

		<p>Multiculturalism is tribalism, which is ingrained in every non-white that emigrates to this country.  </p>
<p>The above writer makes no amazing revelations to anyone with good sense, because it is those same types who have always opposed multiculturalism who knew what the eventual outcome was going to be.  We&rsquo;re seeing it bring this empire down right before our very eyes.  </p>
<p>So, of course the left is responsible for the tribal chaos in the West right now.  And the right is responsible to a lesser degree, because many of them have always wanted cheap labor.  Well, here&rsquo;s hoping they enjoy what they have supported for so long.</p>
<p>Diversity is without doubt a horrible weakness.  To find the worst trouble spots in the US is a simple matter of locating the most diverse areas.</p>
<p>In fact, it might be a good idea to take note of them right now, because that&rsquo;s where the worst fighting is going to be.  </p>

<p>Interesting take here, especially since the Red &ldquo;ruling class&rdquo; in the USA has always wanted to be the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; emulators of nonwhites in behavior and radicalism. This is particularly true of their early years, when they are in their teens and twenties. Some never stop this (chiefly those in the &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; celebrity cast,) but those in the political class, tend to evolve into &ldquo;protectors&rdquo; of their beloved &ldquo;exploited persons of color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus what you really have in maturity, is an Orwellian model of upper-class brutality and exploitation towards the middle-class whites of this country. They are actively seeking to destroy this class via the nonwhite &ldquo;Proles,&rdquo; as they have romanticized them to be; indeed, the &ldquo;Proles and animals are free&rdquo; and cherished above any white not in the &ldquo;Inner Party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I must disagree with this one. Seeing as I myself am a practitioner of Asatru, a religion that is tribal and overwhelmingly politically and socially conservative, I would say that multiculturalism is in fact the diametric opposite of tribalism. True tribalism is about loyalty to one&rsquo;s own kind rather than to civil or national groupings, although those things may coincide. Multiculturalism wants to erase the things that make tribes distinct and make everyone one big happy non-judgmental melting-pot family. The Left is too much into centralized, global village, one world order to ever be considered tribalist. Tribalism believes in localization, separation of differing tribes or peoples, pride in the traditions and achievements of one&rsquo;s own people, and a duty of loyalty to one&rsquo;s own people. I daresay under this traditional definition of tribalism, many readers of AmRen are tribalists, while most of the Left would find it repugnant.  </p>

<p>Among most well meaning and well intentioned and fair minded people the thought has always been that the LEFT in America, even when goofy, is well intentioned and means WELL, but just goes about things in the wrong way, but does want well for all concerned.</p>
<p>BUT NO, the left in American is EVIL! They want this country destroyed and are DEAD SET on achieving their GOAL. Want this country dead as the dodo and hopefully soon too, with all that will mean.</p>
<p>Look at all the &#8220;hot button&#8221; radio talk show topics and you will see how the LEFT in American lies consistently and constantly about their &#8220;goals&#8221;. Destruction is the goal and you should NEVER forget it.</p>

<p>It is great to see a post by a Norse Centric interpretation.  I often write, for about six years now, on how Christianity is really a Middle-Eastern religion that invaded and conquered Europe and suppressed through the most continual violent reign of terror in history, and teaches the very principles of diversity, socialism, and world order psychology through its Christian tennets.  This sets up a hugely palpable set of hyposcrisies that are continually and successfully used against whites who wish to act tribal, yet insist on doing it, like John PM, through a belief in the Jewish God and his alleged flesh and blood son, and his alleged teachings, combined with the incoherent ramblings of some early promoters.  </p>
<p>I am glad to see that there is a growing Asatru culture growing in North America.  I am concerned that it might be like many other modern &#8220;pagan&#8221; and &#8220;Wiccan&#8221; communities, undisciplined and merely a hangout for people who want to play SCA games and carry on the party atosphere of the &#8220;Free Love&#8221; Sixties, with dope and flopping included.  So I will welcome a post to me from you, that all may read, outlining the general function of at least your Asatru community.<br>

<p>We have it worse in Britain,especially with the  women. White women like Harriet Harman(we call her &#8216;Harperson&rsquo;) is the worse living example of a white male hating feminist. What I mean is the ich female feminists eliteslike her only seem to save their venom for the white male of the species. Certainly you never hear them speak ill against the black homophobe/sexist rap artists or the backward thinking Muslim community leaders and  imans  etc. The Tories also have their version who refers to too many white men as something &#8216;too male and pale&rsquo;.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true John PM,<br>
I always wonder why so many Pop singers no matter what they sound like when they&rsquo;re speaking, almost always sound Black when they sing. &#8220;My&#8221; is &#8220;Mah&#8221; or &#8220;Muh&#8221;, &#8220;Love&#8221; is &#8220;luuv&#8221; and &#8220;ain&rsquo;t&#8221;, double negatives e.g Ain&rsquo;t no bahdeh lack you beibah.<br>
That&rsquo;s why I like Opera singers. When you&rsquo;re singing in another language, Afro-dialect just doesn&rsquo;t cut it. <br>

		<p>To the liberal elite, white Christian heterosexuals are THE ENEMY.  We stand in the way of their dreamed-of social paradise in which religion is no more and free love is everywhere.  They&rsquo;re even willing to throw in with the Moslems in order to see our demise.  (How they will deal with Sharia is anyone&rsquo;s guess!)  They don&rsquo;t care that the U.S. will come to resemble Brazil, with hordes of have-nots teeming in the streets.  Just as they do now, the elites will remain in their ivory towers and tut-tut over the state of the great unwashed.</p>

		<p>Hrothwynn and WhitePlight are correct.  Asatru teaches true tribalism, which is why it is growing as an ever-more-suicidal and self-hating Christianity dwindles.</p>

<p>Thanks for both the positive feedback and a good laugh!</p>
<p>Often I am disgusted at the lengths that &ldquo;performers&rdquo; go to, in order to prove their &ldquo;insights&rdquo; and &ldquo;tolerance.&rdquo; Here is a favorite example of mine:</p>

<p>And you don&rsquo;t think that you are equally acting &ldquo;tribal&rdquo; here?</p>
<p>You can denounce my love for God and Christianity as much as you want, but by doing so, you are creating a schism in the white realist ranks here at AR that no adherence to our country&rsquo;s traditional Judeo-Christian faiths ever could. What percentage of the AR readership do you think is Christians or Jewish after all Whiteplight: 65%, 75%, 85%, 95%? In short, yours is the typical coded hatred for Jews and their faith, that allows for Muslims to be pitied by some here, because they are &ldquo;victims&rdquo; of Israel and the &ldquo;misguided&rdquo; Christian West. Moreover, You probably would support a Stalinist form of Marxism, so long as it allowed for the humane treatment of horses and eventually annihilated both Christians and Jews. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Ignore the Left&rsquo;s ideological blather.  Tribalism is a step in the right direction.  White preservationists should promote the concept to wife, family, and long-time friends.  The operator of the website below, although not a WN, has independently derived what others and myself have been talking about for years:</p>
<p><a href="http://factorefarm.org/" rel="nofollow">http://factorefarm.org/</a> </p>
<p>&ldquo;By our analysis, most of the technologies needed for a sustainable and pleasant standard of living could be reduced to the cost of scrap metal + labor. There is immense potential for social transformation once this technology is fully developed for building interconnected self-sufficient communities, since people will be freed from material constraints and able to seek self-actualization.&rdquo; </p>
