<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Trejo is among the 66,000 migrants who enter the United States legally as H2B Guest Workers.</p>
<p>H2B is a visa program that gives workers access to minimum-wage, non-agricultural jobs that, employers say, would otherwise go unfilled because the pay is low, the employment seasonal and the work often back breaking and tedious.</p>
<p>Trejo&rsquo;s employer is G. W. Hall &amp; Son [&#8220;Trejo&#8221; is an immigrant in the country under the H2B Guest Workers program], a major seafood supplier on Hoopers Island, a remote community on Maryland&rsquo;s eastern shore. For eight hours a day, five or six days a week Trejo works at a long table where the hard-shelled crabs, caught that morning and then steamed, are piled high and ready for her to pick apart. </p>
<p>She makes a minimum hourly wage of $7.25, sometimes more if she picks quickly. Risking injury Trejo works at a rapid pace tossing empty shells into large waste cans. The job is not difficult. It&rsquo;s a matter of practice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Jobs Americans don&rsquo;t want</b></p>
<p>G.W. Hall &amp; Son once employed American workers. No more. The company says seasonal tedious jobs don&rsquo;t appeal to Americans anymore.</p>
<p>So owner Brian Hall says he does everything he can to keep his Mexican workers happy. &#8220;We provide transportation to and from Mexico. They&rsquo;ve got a house, a satellite TV, air conditioning. Anything they want, we get it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ninety percent of Hall&rsquo;s business is picking crab meat. Without the women, he says, &#8220;I&rsquo;m out of business and every other plant [around here] is too.&#8221; Crab is a $30 million a year industry in Maryland.</p>
<p>Trejo rents the three-bedroom ranch house she shares with co-workers from G.W. Hall &amp; Son.</p>
<p>It is the money that keeps her here for the season, which can last between eight and nine months. &#8220;In Mexico, I earned 1,400 pesos [$110] every two weeks. Here I can earn that in three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Exploited workers</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Trejo wants too. She&rsquo;s already earned enough to open a small shop in Mexico, but until it can support her family and help build a better future for her daughter, she will have to continue returning to her job shelling crabs in America.<br>

		<p>Liberals complain about the increasing economic inequality in our country.  And they are right, there has been a substantial increase in economic inequality over the past 40 years.  Working class, nongovernmental jobs with a defined benefit pension existed in the 60s and 70s, they are nearly nonexistent now.  Also, I agree with the liberals that this increase in inequality is bad for social cohesion and ultimately for democracy.  But those same liberals support illegal immigration and the H2B program, which are what have made it possible for employers to keep jobs much lower paying in real terms than they were 40 years back.  Suppose that Maryland company could not import cheap labor?  It would have to increase wages, and so would its competitors.  It would have to raise the price of crab meat to cover the increase in wages.  The main consumers of crab meat are middle and upper middle class people.  The effect would be a transfer of wealth from middle and upper middle class people to the working poor.  I, an evil middle class poster to Amren&rsquo;s forum, am in favor of that.  The liberals are against it.</p>

		<p>To reinforce WR the elder&rsquo;s well-articulated and important point, the agricultural sector is addicted to exploitable illegal labor  &mdash;  ignoring the dire social consequences their greed visits on the nation.</p>
<p>Economist Thomas Sowell explains their folly: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Leaving prices out of the picture is probably the source of more fallacies in economics than any other single misconception. At current wages for low-level jobs and current levels of welfare, there are indeed many jobs that Americans will not take. The fact that immigrants  &mdash;  and especially illegal immigrants  &mdash;  will take those jobs is the very reason the wage levels will not rise enough to attract Americans &hellip; . It is elementary supply and demand. Yet we continue to hear about the &#8216;need&rsquo; for immigrants to do jobs that Americans will not do  &mdash;  even though these are all jobs that Americans have done for generations before mass illegal immigration became a way of life.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I would like to follow up with another post on the consequences of illegal immigration.  I believe that I posted this story sometime back but it&rsquo;s relevant here and worth retelling.</p>
<p>When she was working full time my sister hired a woman to come in once a week to tidy up her house.  After many years the cleaning woman said that she had to raise her rates because many years of modest but steady inflation had eroded her real earnings.  My sister looked at how long it had been since the rates were raised and agreed that the increase was fair and reasonable.  My sister lives in one of the few parts of the country that is not yet inundated with illegal immigrants.  The woman she hired is a white American citizen.  The cleaning woman also did work for a rich man who used to live in California.  He was angry and upset over the price increase.  He said, &#8220;You don&rsquo;t have to pay taxes!&#8221;.  The woman informed him that she did in fact have to pay taxes, and in addition was paying for her son&rsquo;s college education.  The rich man was taken aback.  He of course was used to hiring illegal aliens for domestic work back in California, so naturally assumed that people in that line of work didn&rsquo;t pay taxes and didn&rsquo;t concern themselves with paying for their numerous offspring&rsquo;s higher education.</p>
<p>This third worldization of the United States, in which a small core of wealthy elites exploit a vast pool of cheap, malleable labor, is exactly the future the Democrats, the open borders Republicans, and the SPLC want for our entire country.</p>

		<p>This is hideously ridiculous, so absurd as to defy any believability.</p>
<p>I was born to millionaire parents. I did not in fact know we were rich. We lived well, but not in the least bit ostentatiously.</p>
<p>I worked for family buisnesses as a kid, even though I played three or four sports a year. I was not let off the hook.</p>
<p>When I moved out, I worked in gas stations, washed dishes, cooked, and was especially happy to have a very hard factory job where I earned a mere 4.10 per hour to bust my self in dangerous conditions.</p>
<p>I later went to college and grad school. Mom and dad helped, but did NOT pay my tuition.  Why? I was poor enough to qualify for Pell grants! Because I could not find jobs at a good wage. So what! I never felt, or acted poor. </p>
<p>Americans (at least at or over age 40), are full of a history of many menial, busting jobs. We were never ashamed.</p>
<p>It was neocons and liberal marxist idiots (and their third world enablers) that killed American labor, NOT Americans!</p>

		<p>Jobs that I have seen illegal hispanic invaders doing in Arizona in the last six months: </p>
<p>Construction: medical center, condominiums<br>
Maintenance: apartments, hotels<br>
Welfare state: milking schools, cities, counties, and states</p>
<p>This is just what I have seen daily around me as I spent the last seven months unemployed and very depressed. I had time to walk my puppy and watch the above. Aren&rsquo;t there still young American men who want to build gorgeous, state-of-the-art buildings in their home towns? Aren&rsquo;t there still handy Americans who want to do go good work in places like hotels and apartment complexes? Is America so wealthy and her resources so abundant that she can afford to pay $10,000 per year to educate one of the many offspring of illegal invaders who don&rsquo;t pay taxes? Doing one&rsquo;s American duty  &mdash;  like paying taxes and following the laws of the land  &mdash;  is optional?</p>
<p>The bottom line: more than 10,000,000 Americans are out of work; more than 10,000,000 non-Americans are illegally in OUR NATION &hellip; and they&rsquo;re &#8220;making a living&#8221; somehow. And they are not all picking berries!</p>

		<p>Then why don&rsquo;t these employers raise their salaries. They could get American workers if they didn&rsquo;t pay slave wages. Americans can&rsquo;t afford to work for slave wages, pay taxes and still feed their families. True, the price of crab meat would go up but so what! When the price of taxes and everything else goes up because of so many poor foreigners getting medicaid, overcrowding the schools, more crime, more racial tensions etc., you&rsquo;d actually come out far ahead just paying Americans  more and charging more for crab meat. Anyways, in the event that there are genuine job shortages in some areas, Mexicans can come legally and work for a specified period of time and then must go home and the employer pays for the ticket. They don&rsquo;t have to immigrate. There is a difference.</p>

		<p> Yeah, Doing the jobs we just won&rsquo;t do. So she works for 7 plus dollars an hour,gets free trans. from and back to mexico,satellite t.v. etc and works 40 plus hours a week. This position is for eight to nine months a year. If the wages were raised so a person could live on them they would have no problems filling them with Americans. On another note where are all of the young people,the entry level workers sixteen and up that would probably take these jobs? I guess we don&rsquo;t do that anymore. I guess we don&rsquo;t bus tables, bag groceries,work as waiters etc. anymore. Or is it that we won&rsquo;t take abuse without fighting back? It&rsquo;s well known that these people will swim a river of poo and not say a word and thats what these employers want and love. Jobs we won&rsquo;t do my butt!</p>

		<p>You all seemed to have not considered one point. We are in a global economy. The other scenario is we now have to import all our crabmeat and all these businesses close and Americans loose more jobs. Just like increasing the costs of fast food because of labor costs. Who will buy a $6.00 hamburger? It is not always so simple. If you ever ran a business maybe you would be more sympathetic. </p>

		<p>I am so tired of hearing the temporary seasonal employer&rsquo;s are all about &#8220;cheap wages&#8221;. The 1st requirement of getting &#8220;permission&#8221; to hire temporary workers is to ask the Federal Department of Labor what the prevailing wage is for the area of employment. Once that is done ads must run to offer those jobs to American&rsquo;s. Most times no one even applies, or if they do apply they have several demands before accepting the job, or they only apply so they can continue to get the unemployment checks. Many U.S. applicants are hired but when the job starts they never show up.</p>
<p>Also many U.S. workers can not just pack a bag and go to a remote location to live in dorms and work for 4-6 months. There is a lot more to this than you ever really read about. Many of the workers here legally do not want to be citizens and the fact is without the additional seasonal staff many tourist related buinesses would have to close and then even more Americans would be without jobs. There are many legal ways for people to come here to work and we can protect the U.S. workers who really want to work. No one should be able to be here illegally and work. But the government is making it almost impossible for the legal employer&rsquo;s to do it legal. The reason? to push amnesty thru (as if that is gonna help)!As for unemployment I am 60 years old. Live in a very small community, I am shocked at how many jobs there are available, I recently applied for a couple and literally have 2 employer&rsquo;s &#8220;fighting over me&#8221; I didn&rsquo;t think anyone would look my way (age and all) but they need staff and it seems the &#8220;unemployed around here&#8221; are not interested.</p>

		<p>A high rate of immigration means more customers and more job applicants.  By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits.  If you get your income from interest, rent, and dividends, you benefit from the current high rate of immigration.  If you work for a living, you pay the price.  </p>

		<p>Now math may not be my strong suite but&hellip;</p>
<p>I wonder what her rent is like and exactly how many coworkers have to share that three bedroom ranch before GWHS breaks even.</p>
<p>If she is making 1,100 dollars a month and the house is renting for 1,200 plus another 50-70 for cable, and 150 for utilities, she is dividing with -only- three other people (i.e. living like Americans, not like ants).  Plus say 150 for home cooked food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a total of 623 bucks in expenses.<br>
 <br>
Assuming the company picks them up every morning so they don&rsquo;t have to worry about drivers licenses, gas and insurance on their own vehicle.</p>
<p>And another one-time fee of 200 bucks for her AmTrak/Greyhound/Trailways ticket.</p>
<p>She is taking home about 477 a month or 4,093 dollars total for 9 months.</p>
<p>I have no clue if H2Bs have to pay taxes or FICA or if there is some other employer health insurance she has to contribute to because of her dangerous job classification.</p>
<p>But life must be pretty damn cheap in Mexico if she can come here and sustain a household there for a grand total of 4,093 bucks over 8-9 months.</p>

<p>Actually you&rsquo;re right on the money. Minimum wage in mexico is 57 pesos a day about $4.54. Make your own calulations and you&rsquo;ll see that its more than reasonable for her to come here and work a few months to save some money. Don&rsquo;t assume anything before being informed.</p>
