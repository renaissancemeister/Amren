			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Watson, Prison Planet, August 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man purporting to be a Rand Paul supporter was caught on film brandishing a racist sign at a rally in Kentucky this past weekend, then later spotted marching with supporters of Paul&rsquo;s political opponent.</p>
<p>In a another blatant case of provocateuring, the man, who introduced himself as &#8220;Tyler&#8221; was spotted wearing a tin foil hat and flip flops around his neck with the word &#8220;CAP &amp; TRADE&#8221; written on them.</p>
<p>While carrying an official Rand Paul campaign hand fan, he also held an anti-immigration sign that read &#8220;They take our jobs! Corrupt our children! STEAL the American Dream!&#8221;</p>
<p>The provocateur was caught out by an attendee at the Fancy Farm political celebration in Kentucky who claimed he saw the man speaking with supporters and campaign officials of Paul&rsquo;s opponent for the Kentucky Senate, Jack Conway, shortly before making his way into the crowds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, Slate readers and real Rand Paul supporters did some digging around and have revealed that the man is Tyler Clay Collins, a Murray State University member of the Kentucky Young Democrats, who worked campaigning for Obama for two years.</p>
<p>Pictures taken from Collins&rsquo; facebook page, which has since been pulled, show him at an Obama rally in 2008 and posing with Jack Conway backer Crit Luallen. Collins even has Conway as a Facebook friend:</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a comment left on a 2008 news article about Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaign, Collins declared himself &#8220;a hardcore Democrat&#8221;.</p>
<p>We have seen several instances of this kind of pathetic provocateuring at Tea Party events in the past, with promises of violence and racist slurs coming from Obama supporters in an effort to demonize legitimate Libertarian and Tea Party activists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I hope everyone notices that it&rsquo;s Liberals/democrats etc. that are lacking in principles. They have no ethical issues when it comes to corrupting the election process, whether it&rsquo;s having the dead vote in Chicago, Black panthers intimidating white voters, registering illegal aliens, paying and busing the homeless to fake rallies, Bell CA city officials going door to door the collect absentee ballots, and &#8220;assisting&#8221; the illiterate &#8220;voters with filling out their ballots, the Minn. senate election that put Franken into office, and it&rsquo;s black democrats who are especially corrupt.</p>

		<p>The Conway campaign had better repudiate this Collins kid, and the sooner the better. How long it takes until this repudiation will depend on how savvy, or unsavvy, Conway&rsquo;s campaign is.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: the MSM newspaper did not get the real story on Collins, the new media did. No wonder we call the MSM the &#8220;dinosaur media.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Clever, these Leftists! Call the Rand Paul supporters &#8220;racist;&#8221; then, plant a bogus &#8220;Paul supporter&#8221; who will make the most &#8220;racist&#8221; statements he can think of when the cameras are running. Only this one got caught   &mdash;   wasn&rsquo;t careful enough. Didn&rsquo;t seem to terribly smart, either.</p>
<p> Back when Richard Nixon&rsquo;s people tried to get the upper hand of their opponents this way, it was called &#8220;political dirty tricks.&#8221; Now, I suppose the Left will borrow another phrase from the Sixties, and call such things as &#8220;Tyler&rsquo;s&#8221; prank, a &#8220;symbolic truth.&#8221; That is, Rand Paul supporters and the Tea Party Movement in general MUST, by definition, be &#8220;racist&#8221;; so, putting on some guerrilla theater to help make them look that way to the media is morally justified. I suspect Saul Alinsky is looking up from hell, and smiling.</p>

<p>No big surprise here, none at all!</p>
<p>Communists like Comrade Tyler here, are unscrupulous traitors to both their race and country. One can see it in those videos of Comrade Obama&rsquo;s usefully idiotic white plaything, as he fecklessly attempts to suppress his smug laughter when being challenged for being a bootlicker to his Marxist &ldquo;messiah&rdquo; and not actually a Rand Paul supporter.</p>
<p>One wonders, was the tinfoil cap on his head for Red political theater, or so that messages could be &ldquo;conducted&rdquo; to him in electronically stimulated mental obamagasms, while he played at being a man and not a wretched political gigolo to our &ldquo;sainted&rdquo; Pimp-in-Chief&rsquo;s whimsies? </p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you plug the hole yet daddy?&rdquo;</p>

When I worked at the university, every fall, an self-proclaimed Evangelical Christian preacher would show up outside the student union and give a fire and brimstone sermon on homosexuals. Of course, the PC automatons would shout back and call him names.</p>
<p>Before I left, apparently one student asked him what church he belonged to because he wanted to join the church. He told the group his church was out of NYC and not local. Feeling the jig was up, he left.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that these guys who showed up each year as anti-gay bigots were pro-gay provocateurs.</p>
<p>I wish I had the time and money to hangout outside the student union for the fall semester to catch these guys on tape and challenge them. </p>

		<p>This should surprise nobody. A basic tenet of the left is that their higher moral plane gives them license to lie, cheat, make false accusations, and win by any means necessary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no accident that the greatest mass slaughters and the greatest extinguishments of human freedom in all recorded history have been the work of leftist regimes, all of which claim to represent the interests of the &#8220;workers.&#8221; This is simply fact, not conjecture.</p>
<p>Of course, leftists insist that these were merely unfortunate &#8220;excesses&#8221; and with a bit of fine tuning they&rsquo;ll get their superior social and economic system right and mankind will enter a new golden age of fraternity and brotherhood.</p>
<p>Perhaps humanity would be better served if we could isolate the Bolshevik genetic code and sterilize every carrier.</p>

<p>Well, this is what I thought was occurring. With the Tea Party movement too. Agent provocateurs infiltrating the ranks and creating discord. Deliberately sent? Perhaps so. </p>
<p>This is a very disreputable practice and needs to be NOT DONE by anyone!</p>

		<p>Things like this are to be expected. The establishment fears the mass of people becoming independent minded and will resort to dirty tricks. The Cass Sunstein team of internet trolls are probably at work sowing differences and promoting factionalism in a divide and conquer strategy. We wouldn&rsquo;t be aware of the extent of it all; certainly they have vast resources at their disposal.  </p>

		<p>Ironically, if people got it in their heads that this was a real TPer and a real Rand Paul supporter, this might have resulted in Paul getting more votes and winning the election by an even bigger margin than he otherwise would.  It&rsquo;s the Archie Bunker syndrome all over again   &mdash;   Norman Lear thought he was insulting &#8220;white racists,&#8221; when the Bunker character said almost nothing that was shocking and repulsive to the average white person watching AITF.</p>

<p>I enjoy your posts, I normally agree with them 100%; however, here, I must respectfully disagree with you. These Reds and Neo-Marxists, are guilty of not just individual murders (through their policies and propaganda, that both encourage and excuse the homicidal violence of nonwhites against whites) but also on a larger scale, through their institutionalized multiculturalism, which integrates these individual murders into a single common mega-atrocity. Moreover and in the end, they work for something far more massive than simple murder, they work for the eventual genocide of the entire white race!</p>
<p>Just something to think about and all the best to you Sardonicus,</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good that this guy was caught, but the Left is going to try far worse tricks than this.  They&rsquo;ll have plants in Tea Parties with racist signs and then stage attacks by them on minorities from the outside, with very audible racial slurs. </p>
<p>The Left media will pick up on this and excoriate the Tea Parties and associate the behavior with the Republican Party, just in time for the election.  Obama will offer us another teaching moment and we&rsquo;ll hear from black and White liberal Congressmen. <br>
