			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruce Watson, Daily Finance, August 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Anyone who has ever watched an episode of Animal Planet knows that ecosystems are fragile, relying on the delicate balance of species and resources. But what is less-known is the high economic cost when that balance is upset by animals that are alien to an area.</p>
<p>Some animals and insects  &mdash;  including killer bees, Asian carp and Asian mongooses  &mdash;  are introduced by humans to correct an imbalance, but end up posing an unforeseen threat to other species. In some cases, species that were once endangered grow out of control due to the efforts of concerned scientists and environmentalists to protect them. Caught between the danger of doing too much or too little, only one thing is certain: when it comes to the environment, each option carries a high price.</p>
<p>Here are 10 animals that, for one reason or another, have overpopulated their environment, threatening other species, resources and, ultimately, themselves.</p>
<p><b>Canada Geese</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but a little over 100 years ago, over-hunting drove Canada geese close to extinction. New York State officials decided that the birds needed help if they were to survive and, from 1958 to 1963, wildlife experts released scores of geese into the state&rsquo;s forests. Before long huge flocks were settling throughout the state.</p>
<p>Today, officials face the opposite problem: There are more than 200,000 geese in New York, and they have begun endangering public health by soiling parks and lakes, stripping farmers&rsquo; fields and getting in the way of airplanes. According to one report, over the last ten years, they have struck 78 planes in the area, costing $2.2 million in aircraft damage and killing at least 24. In fact, 2009&rsquo;s &#8220;Miracle on the Hudson&#8221; plane crash was caused by Canada geese.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Cownose Ray</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The huge ray population  &mdash;  which has expanded because of the overfishing of coastal sharks  &mdash;  keeps gobbling up the thousands of farmed oysters that wildlife officials have farmed throughout the [Chesapeake] Bay. So here&rsquo;s a quick recap: too few sharks = too many rays = too few oysters = stingray fricasee. Bon appetit!</p>
<p><b>Asian Carp</b></p>
<p>In the Great Lakes, fishing is big business: a $7.5 billion industry, it supports an estimated 800,000 jobs. Unfortunately, the lakes  &mdash;  the world&rsquo;s largest freshwater ecosystem  &mdash;  are extremely fragile, and are under attack by a number of invasive species. Already harassed by zebra mussels and sea lampreys, fishermen in the area are frightened by another potential threat: Asian carp. Imported by catfish farmers in the 1970&rsquo;s to skim algae from aquaculture ponds, the fish escaped from their original home and migrated throughout the Mississippi River, massively depleting plankton and pushing out other species.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Coyotes</b></p>
<p>Unlike most invasive species, coyotes are native to North America, with a natural habitat that extends from Alaska to Central America over terrain ranging from mountains to plains to  &mdash;  these days  &mdash;  cities (in one notable case, a coyote even staked out a Chicago Quiznos).</p>
<p>{snip} A 2004 survey by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (summarized in this livestock report) found that coyotes were responsible for killing an estimated 135,600 sheep and lambs worth $10.7 million. The extensive cost to agriculture has led government officials to spend millions every year poisoning, trapping and shooting an estimated 90,000 coyotes.</p>
<p><b>Pythons</b></p>
<p>It was bad enough when Floridians just had to worry about Burmese pythons: the Everglades are infested with an estimated 100,000 of the gargantuan snakes, many of which are descended from abandoned pets. Recently, however, African rock pythons  &mdash;  an even larger, more aggressive python species  &mdash;  have been found in the swamp, and experts worry that the new snakes might be interbreeding with the Burmese pythons, yielding what some officials have referred to as a &#8220;super snake.&#8221; Thus far, the pythons have largely stayed in the Florida swamps, but experts warn that the new hybrid could be very adaptable, potentially spreading as far north as Virginia and all the way to California. Along the way, the snakes  &mdash;  which are capable of eating goats and crocodiles  &mdash;  could eventually pose a major threat to children, pets and livestock.</p>
<p><b>Killer Bees</b></p>
<p>While their proper name is &#8220;Africanized honey bees,&#8221; the name &#8220;killer bees&#8221; caught the country&rsquo;s attention in the late 1970&rsquo;s, when thousands of hybrid African/European bees began working their way North from their home in Brazil. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} While they are more aggressive about defending their nests, their stings only kill an estimated one to two people per year. On the bright side, they also produce far more honey than most bees, a factor that has encouraged many beekeepers to interbreed the Africanized bees with their existing stocks.</p>
<p><b>Starlings</b></p>
<p>In 1890, drug manufacturer Eugene Scheiffelin had a beautiful, romantic idea: he decided to use his money to bring all the birds mentioned in Shakespeare&rsquo;s works to New York City. While his experiments with thrushes and skylarks failed, the 100 starlings that he imported from Europe thrived in their new home. By 1942, their descendants had spread across the country.</p>
<p>Today, an estimated 200 million starlings are flying around North America. The birds gather in massive flocks that force out native species, denude acres of crops, and disrupt airports. According to a study by Cornell University, the birds cause $800 million in agricultural damage each year, and federal aviation officials say that they have caused millions of dollars in damage to the airline industry. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Mountain Pine Beetles</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The current pine beetle infestation, which began in the mid-1990&rsquo;s, may be the largest forest insect blight in North American history. As of this year, the beetles have destroyed an estimated 3.6 million acres of trees in Colorado and Wyoming. It is difficult to estimate the full cost of this infestation: in the short term, the U.S. Forest Service committed $40 million for cleanup efforts in 2009. However, the long-term impact of the infestation is almost immeasurable: in British Columbia, where the tiny bugs destroyed a forest area roughly the size of California and New York combined, they will end up costing an estimated 11,000 jobs over the next 14 years.</p>
<p><b>Brown Tree Snakes</b></p>
<p>Island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable, a fact that was driven home in the 1950&rsquo;s when brown tree snakes hitched a ride to Guam aboard U.S. military transport planes. The island, which had no native snakes and few natural predators, was quickly overrun as the highly venomous vipers decimated native animal species, including the once-abundant Micronesian kingfisher which no longer exist in the wild on the island. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Asian Mongooses</b></p>
<p>If brown tree snakes ever get a toehold on Hawaii, they will find a tough reception. One famed snake predator, the small Asian mongoose (also known as the Indian mongoose), already infests the islands. In the 1800&rsquo;s, a sugar cane planter in Hawaii brought 72 of the little animals to help control an overwhelming rat population. Established on all the islands except Kaua&rsquo;i  &mdash;  according to legend, the animals bit a dock worker, who responded by hurling their cages into the ocean  &mdash;  the mongooses ate a few rats, but soon developed a taste for easier prey, including the hundreds of endangered species that can only be found on the islands. {snip}</p>
<p>The mongooses&rsquo; cost to the islands are measured less in dollars than in the richness and diversity of Hawaii&rsquo;s animal populations: many of the islands&rsquo; water birds have been driven to the brink of extinction by the furry little hunters. {snip}<br>

		<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s always OK to bitch at an animal for &#8220;causing a problem&#8221;, isn&rsquo;t it?  Even the ones who do belong on the continent, like Canada geese and coyotes (and coyotes expanded so much because their main competitor, the wolf, has been wiped from most of its ancient range) &hellip;.</p>
<p>When will it be OK to point out that migrations of HUMANS cause the MOST problems in the world? (Is it still OK to mention Amerind slaughter of the Mastodon unto extinction, or the Maori slaughter of the Giant Moa?)</p>

		<p>The asian carp is an ecological disaster waiting to happen that could dwarf the gulf oil spill.These are huge fish that will decimate the native fish population.  The sound of power boats make them leap out of the water, making even power boating dangerous.  Obama refuses to act on this because his Chicago shipping pals don&rsquo;t want any barriers to shipping.</p>

		<p>This one scientist stated that invasive species are more of a threat to the environment that global warming! [the planet has been warming for the last 10,000 years and the reason is NOT man-made, that is as far as I will go with the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amerind slaughter of the Mastodon unto extinction, or the Maori slaughter of the Giant Moa?)&#8221;</p>
<p>NOT ONLY the mastodon but entire species of larger animals as well in prehistoric times! NOT just one animal species. The Hawaiian islanders and entire bird species just to make feathered robes for their &#8220;royalty&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>American Indians as well conducting mass killing of the American buffalo just to harvest the tongues, etc.</p>
<p>So much of that. The &#8220;indigenous&#8221; populations reputation for living in harmony with nature in a pristine manner is much overblown!! Don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

		<p>The constant discovery of pirana, especially where isolated bodies of water are, present a major problem for S.Fl.  What is particularly interesting is the reinfestation of isolated bodies of water after the state has cleared them of pirana.  A FWC law enforcement officer off record, &#8220;It&rsquo;s as if someone wants to make sure these fish get into our freshwater and stay there&#8221;.  Terrorism or just careless, dangerous behavior?</p>

		<p>Another consequence of globalization is the Asian long horned beetle, which has been accidentally imported to several spots in America through Chinese wooden crates.  When it infests a tree the tree is doomed and to prevent further infestation you have to chop the tree down, grind it up, and burn it.</p>
<p>I think it is a mislabeling to call coyotes or Canadian geese invasive species.  They can be pests but they are native to the United States.</p>

		<p>Maybe if we just tuck our heads under our wings, stand real still on one leg, and just sort of blend into the scenery  &mdash;  and keep whispering to ourselves, &#8220;We&rsquo;re pretty birds.&#8221; </p>
<p>I believe there have been a half-dozen or so of the most massive extinction episodes in the history of the planet, including the current man-made one that, if it continues to run its course, some experts believe, will eventually wipe out half of the species on earth. As far as intra-human competition, I often think of the large flightless birds that had survived just fine for eons on the islands of the South Pacific, and in their final days were no doubt clueless about what was happening as humans moved in on them. I particularly think of this when it comes to Scandinavia, with their proud cradle-to-grave social safety nets that they must have believed could handle just about anything. But now they too have their &#8220;no-go&#8221; areas, where even ambulances often need armed protection. Of course the large flightless birds did not have entire libraries of historical information and scientific research to warn them, and yet humans of Western civilization seem to have been caught almost equally flat-footed, or at least so far.<br>

		<p>The article states killer bees were introduced to fix a problem? I thought escaped from contained hive under study in South America.</p>
<p>And it is not fair to call coyotes or armadillo&rsquo;s or rattlesnakes invasive species when they are indegenous and simply expanding their territory.</p>
<p>Being a dog lover I especially feel bad for the coyotes, very smart and little dogs they are so often hunted and poisoned as a means of &#8220;control&#8221;. Studies have shown those methods do not reduce their numbers as they self-limit breeding based on available territory. For those that need to protect livestock  from coyotes I would suggest the use of Livestock Guardian Dogs, they do a great job of keeping livestock safe from predation by driving the predators away and only killing if they have to. I keep a beautiful Anatolian as a household guardian and they are fantastic.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that you included coyotes on this list (a native species), but not feral house cats that kill millions of our native migratory birds and small animals annually or feral horses that destroy thosands of acres of rangelands in the West.</p>

		<p>No matter how many non-human species are mentioned in this article, they will never compare to the damage done to America by the likes of Mexican migrants, Somali terrorists, Hmong refugees and Central American gangs (MS-13). The difference is the non-human species do not provide sources of cheap labor to employers, votes to politicians or money to the collection plates of religious institutions. </p>

<p><br>
There should be an absolute prohibition on the importation, sale, or possession of exotic dangerous creatures like piranhas, pythons, etc.  And VERY heavy penalties for infractions.  </p>
<p>There is no reason for having such creatures.  The only people who would want to have them are people who are mentally disturbed and get some sort of weird thrill from owning a dangerous pet.  Or, as you suggest, people with other, more sinister motives to cause disruption to society. I have no patience with these sickos. </p>
<p>I do not want to go out walking my dog, and have it attacked by a python (as has happened in Florida). Must less my child! I do not want to go swimming and be attacked by piranhas.</p>
<p>I say, throw the book at them!</p>

		<p>The snakehead which is rapidly spreading in the river systems of Virginia was introduced into the Potamac River by a Chinese Legal immigrant. His sister was in the hospital, near death. She miraculoulsy recovered. It is an ancient Chinese tradition that when something like this happens,that the brother release a snakehead fish into a river. This is ok for Asian river systems were the snakehead fits in harmoniously with the other species&hellip;for America, it has been an unmitigated ecological catastrophe.</p>
<p>Generally,Chinese and Korean legal immigrants continue to illegally import snakehead fish species  into America&hellip;and the snakehead ecological threat continues to spread throughout America.</p>
<p>Post-1965 high fertility nonwhite legal immigrants are a major threat to America&rsquo;s ecosystems. No one should have any doubt about this. They are the number one cause of population growth in America&hellip;they are also  a major vector of invasive species introduction into America&rsquo;s ecosystems.</p>
<p>Shockingly, American &#8220;environmental&#8221; organizations want a massive increase in high fertility legal migration to America. Environmental in name only, I say. They are fake environmental organizations staffed by anti-Native Born White American race-replacement enthusiasts.</p>

		<p>This is something that has happened many times.The English sparrow is not a native species but a bird released by a homesick immigrant,the effect on native songbirds has been disastrous.  The earlier poster is correct,the eastern coyote descended from Canada following the disappearance of the wolf.  Shot out of course by man.  More troubling however are the emergence of new diseases and pests brought by immigrants.  Dengue fever, Malaria, drug resistant Tuberculosis, and bedbugs.  All of these things were successfully eradicated or simply not present decades ago in this country and we have increased immigration to thank for them.  It almost seems too stupid to talk about, man is nature&rsquo;s weakest animal, yet the one that wields the most force  .Mark Twain famously said that man is the only creature capable of malice, I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s entirely true but I know that a great many immigrants seem malicious to me when compared to the average American sheeple,but it is my fellow Americans that encourage their entry that seem far more malicious.  In closing over population is far more dangerous than anything facing the earth today.That&rsquo;s all.</p>

		<p>Invasive species?  Worse than the invasive welfare dependent from Mexico?  Can&rsquo;t think of one.  The medfly at least was met with resistance and efforts to eradicate it in California  &mdash;  the invasive Mexicans?  Welcomed.</p>
<p>As for the medfly, we in California have been battling this invasive pest for 30+ years, including having to endure malathion mixed with (??) sprayed from helicopters during the night over residential areas.</p>
<p>From Wiki:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Fleets of helicopters sprayed malathion at night, and the California National Guard set up highway checkpoints and collected many tons of local fruit</p>
<p>Some people claimed that malathion was toxic to humans, as well as insects. In response to such concerns, Brown&rsquo;s chief of staff, B. T. Collins, staged a news conference during which he publicly drank a small glass of malathion. Many people complained that, while the malathion may not have been very toxic to humans, the aerosol spray containing it was corrosive to car paint&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Reminds me of when the military/government told soldiers &#8216;fighting&rsquo; in Vietnam that Agent Orange was harmless:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Soldiers in Vietnam sprayed one another with AGENT ORANGE in spray fights as they were told the chemical was harmless&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>For a list of cancers directly linked to Agent Orange, see here ( BTW,it&rsquo;s a long long list):</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/26e7urx</p>
<p>What/who are you &#8216;gonna&rsquo; believe, a government official who claims malathion and/or any admixture used to distribute it are harmless or the paint eaten off of your car after a night of spraying?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Residues in small droplets produced by ultra low volume aerial applications have been shown to drift for long distances, causing adverse effects in surrounding waterways. Concentrations of malathion have been measured at levels high enough to cause mortality for non-target invertebrates as far as 200 meters from the application site&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You can be sure the government will deny any claims of malathion damage and continue to tell us:  &#8220;If people are exposed to levels of malathion below those that affect nerve function (i.e. a massive single dose) few or no health problems seem to occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
