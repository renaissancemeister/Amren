			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Dugan, London Independent, August 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Posing for her first school photograph, Joanne was like any other girl at the age of five. She loved drawing and painting, and her favourite game was to play hide-and-seek in the woods near her home in Leeds with her five siblings. As she grew, Joanne liked to hang around, chatting and laughing with friends. But soon after she turned 12, while out playing, she met a gang of men who were to become her pimps. They took advantage of her freedom, gained her trust and prepared to abuse her.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the men who befriended her had seemed nice enough: they showered her with compliments, bought her a phone, and one of them  &mdash;  a 42-year-old married man  &mdash;  became her &#8220;boyfriend&#8221;. Within a year, she was forced into prostitution.</p>
<p>By the time she was 16, Joanne would disappear from the family home for weeks at a time. She was transported between Manchester, Rochdale, Bradford and countless other towns, locked into rooms and made to have sex repeatedly with men for money  &mdash;  not that she saw any of it.</p>
<p>Joanne is only one of many young women who have been subjected to such horrific ordeals across the UK. She is the victim of sex trafficking with a twist: not women brought in illegally from abroad and forced into prostitution, but British born. Targeted on estates throughout the country, they are passed from gang to gang, and work from town to town.</p>
<p>Yet the information on the trafficking of young people for sex within Britain is so scant that experts say the first official figures confirming the trade  &mdash;  seen by The Independent on Sunday  &mdash;  are just &#8220;the very, very tip of the iceberg&#8221;. Figures from the UK Human Trafficking Centre for April 2009 to March 2010 show only 38 Britons were registered as victims. This comes after a snapshot survey by the children&rsquo;s charity Barnardo&rsquo;s revealed it worked with 609 sexually exploited children last year, of whom 90 appeared to have been trafficked within the UK.</p>
<p>The victims, unlike women coerced or tricked into coming into the UK from overseas, frequently have family and friends who are reduced to despair by what is happening. Joanne&rsquo;s mother, Christine, who was bringing up six children on her own, tried to protect her daughter, but the situation quickly spiralled out of her control.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than once I locked her in. She nearly broke her neck jumping out of upstairs windows,&#8221; she recalls. Joanne fought her mother to get out of the house, giving her a black eye.</p>
<p>Before long, what had been flattery turned into violence. Joanne was called on the phone she had been given and was forced to leave the house at all hours to have sex with men. If she didn&rsquo;t do what was wanted, they threatened to hurt her and her family. &#8220;They brainwash these girls,&#8221; her mother says. &#8220;A friend said to me &#8216;it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;d been hypnotised&rsquo;. That phone triggered something, and she&rsquo;d got to respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mother says her pleas to police and social services fell on deaf ears. &#8220;I used to say: &#8216;When are you going to do something?&rsquo; They&rsquo;d say they couldn&rsquo;t do anything unless she complains, but when do you decide that a child has to complain? They said they could do nothing. She was 13. I&rsquo;d take down the number plates of cars as they drove away, but the police wouldn&rsquo;t accept them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IoS is withholding certain details of the identity of the mother and daughter to protect the family.</p>
<p>Campaigners say most victims are aged between 12 and 16, groomed by men to provide sex. Young men and women are typically targeted by one person, who wins their trust before pimping them to others and forcibly transporting them around Britain.</p>
<p>The case in court last month of a 14-year-old girl who disappeared from her home in Manchester after she was offered drugs and alcohol to groom her for sex is typical of the abuse experienced by these victims. Nine men were convicted of sexual crimes  &mdash;  though not for trafficking  &mdash;  and each was sentenced to jail terms ranging from eight months to seven years.</p>
<p>There has still not been one prosecution for trafficking Britons within the UK. And, despite mounting evidence of the scourge, a police report into trafficking to be released this week, called Project Acumen, chose not to assess the scale of trafficking of British nationals. Of the British women they did interview, they decided none exhibited &#8220;the dimensions of the trafficking definition&#8221;.</p>
<p>Chief Superintendent Tony Blockley, head of crime at Derbyshire constabulary, tells a different story. He says: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve always thought of this as a problem that comes from overseas, whereas this is actually happening on our doorsteps. The scale of it is enormous; Derby isn&rsquo;t a hotbed of this  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just one town that&rsquo;s decided to look at this as a problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a new area of policing for us. As soon as you lift the stone up, you start to find things, but people weren&rsquo;t lifting up the stone before. These are the kids that slip under the radar. Victims come from chaotic backgrounds; they are often in children&rsquo;s homes. As they get more involved in the network, the grooming lessens and the abuse increases.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a year of being abused, Joanne started to lash out. &#8220;Virtually overnight she became someone we couldn&rsquo;t even recognise,&#8221; says Christine. &#8220;Her attitude changed and she started to get really distant. After a while she got violent towards her siblings and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social services said she could no longer live in the same place and put her into foster care. The downward spiral accelerated. At 16, Joanne had been missing for seven weeks. &#8220;I took social services to court as they said they didn&rsquo;t have a duty of care,&#8221; says Christine. &#8220;The judge said they did, and the next day she was found, locked in a house with an Asian man, with the door handle taken off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gang that subjected her to this ordeal was Asian. The issue of alleged grooming of white teenage girls by Asian gangs is highly contentious. When the former Labour MP Ann Cryer said that Asian men were targeting white girls, she was accused of racism. With scant research available, there is no evidence that perpetrators or victims predominate from any one race.</p>
<p>Joanne, because she is now 18, is no longer of any interest to her former pimp, says her mother. The teenager is mentally scarred, homeless and drug addicted. &#8220;She&rsquo;s not a child any more, so they&rsquo;re not interested. They&rsquo;ve used her up and thrown her out. One of them said to her: &#8216;In five years&rsquo; time you&rsquo;ll be a crackhead out on the street and I&rsquo;ll be cruising with another 14-year-old.&rsquo; Five years down the line, she is on drugs, on the streets. He  &mdash;  like he told her  &mdash;  is cruising with another 14-year-old.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila Taylor, chair of the National Working Group for Sexually Exploited Children and Young People, said: &#8220;What we&rsquo;re seeing is the tip of the iceberg. This is happening in all cities and many towns. There has been no prosecution of those who sexually exploit children with trafficking legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many parents of victims, Christine is frustrated that the issue has continued to be ignored. &#8220;They&rsquo;ve known about this happening on my estate for a long time. It&rsquo;s not being dealt with because it&rsquo;s such a big issue. If you acknowledge that it goes on you have to do something and they probably think they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to cope with the sheer numbers.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Political correctness is such a cancer.  Only in a &#8220;white&#8221; country could this type of behavior be tolerated by &#8220;outsiders&#8221;.  </p>
<p>In a non-white country, the pimps would be sent out of the country in bodybags. </p>

<p><br>
This paragraph explains something important that, on the surface, appears inexplicable.  In order to understand it, a man MUST admit, something about men and women.  Men must be dominant over women.  Refusal to do so results in the above situation.  </p>
<p>Women respond to dominance.  It is what they want in a man.  It is ALL they want in a man.  Not money, not sex, not beauty, not even power.  Dominance.  Men who refuse to display it are ignored&hellip;..fathers, husbands, lovers.  And women will get into worse and worse trouble unless male dominance is presence.</p>
<p>A smack across the face followed up with a bullet to the pimps head would have instantly cured this pathological situation.  This little girl is chasing dominance.  It&rsquo;s obvious the men are evil.  It&rsquo;s obvious they have little real power, being of the criminal element.  It&rsquo;s obvious her family loves her and has her best interest at heart.  Yet she chases them&hellip;&hellip;why?</p>
<p>It makes no sense until men admit what I just revealed here.</p>
<p>Because British men do not form a lynch mob and go after the invaders and the government that enables them.  Because they do not make it known among the women that this isn&rsquo;t tolerated, the women actively empower the invaders, no matter how sick their behavior is.</p>
<p>This must change.  It only takes a few in order to change it.  Non-dominant men do not dare challenge dominant men.  Instead, they tend to obey them without question.</p>
<p>There will be many men who will question this.  But only from the safety of behind the keyboard.  If that&rsquo;s you, you&rsquo;re part of the problem.</p>

		<p>   War has been declared on the white race by non-whites. Alot of us see it for what it is, many other whites either don&rsquo;t see it or are in on it with the non-whites in order to win their favor. Either way, we are in alot of trouble. When will we unite and throw off the shackles of politically correct, corrupt government, and take back our countries? If you look at all the woes and turmoils of whites today, and step back and look at whom the main agitators are, you would be surprised. Or maybe not. Most are too afraid to mention the name of this group of people. We must take a stand somewhere. Where will it be? Is there any validity left to the &#8220;wrath of the angry saxon&#8221;? </p>

		<p>I blame the parents- the mom in this case for this whole sad situation. If she had taught her daughter from a very young age to stay away from men who were outside her race then this probably would not have happened. It makes me even sicker that the officials who should have been protecting British young people are coming to the rescue of the immigrants who are preying on them. Girls are just growing up too fast- I could not imagine &#8220;dating&#8221; a man old enough to be my father or dating anyone at that age. What kind of mom would allow her daughter to run the streets at all hours and accept very expensive gifts like phones from these sorts of men? If this were my daughter I would put her in some sort of reform or military school to straighten her out. Better yet the mom should have stopped running after men (this is probably the case) and took care of the responsibilities of her children and they would not have turned out this way. </p>

		<p>A good film on this subject is &#8220;London To Brighton&#8221; (2006). As for solutions, it&rsquo;s strange that more family members don&rsquo;t go after the pimps/pornographers like George C. Scott did in &#8220;Hardcore&#8221; (1979).</p>

		<p>NOT ONLY pimped by &#8220;Asian&#8221; men, but I would venture a guess &#8220;pimped&#8221; to other &#8220;Asian&#8221; men.</p>
<p>That must be a feather in the cap of these &#8220;Asian&#8221; men to use white girls in this manner. Evil men to which this crime is more of a way of waging war against the host society.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spit on you and use your young girls in the worst possible way to satisfy our lust!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Societies that allow this to happen are defeated societies. The mental wherewithal to defend what is important to them is lacking, if not totally absent.</p>
<p>These &#8220;Asian&#8221; men must get a real thrill out of violating a white girl. Again, this has the aspects of waging war. </p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy, to drive him before you, to see his cities reduced to ashes, to see those who love him shrouded in tears, and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters.&rdquo; - - Genghis Khan.</p>

<p>Now let us break this down to something very simple and basic, what if the &ldquo;42-year-old married man&rdquo; really was just her &ldquo;boyfriend&rdquo; and not her conniving future pimp? She is 12-years-old, that in of itself is a crime then; just watch the show on MSBC, &ldquo;To Catch a Predator&rdquo; and you see this. </p>
<p>Thus, we have established a baseline of both legal and socially accepted parameters, regarding age and &ldquo;intimacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now you start adding into this: intimidation, violence, abduction, and sexual abuse, these crimes would warrant at the very least 25 years in prison. By my way of thinking, first torture and then execution are in order, but I digress here!</p>
<p>Overall, that any law enforcement agency would respond to this with indifference, and elected officials call any who bring up these issues as &ldquo;racists&rdquo; and &ldquo; hate mongers,&rdquo; is  beyond comprehension. Only, an abysmally debased and inherently evil sociopolitical construct as multiculturalism could excuse it, and thus by omission and proxy encourage it. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>The same thing is happening in Canadian cities, only here we call them &#8220;Middle Eastern men&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The come from Lebanon, Algeria, Pakistan, Iran and all points in between.</p>
<p>The common characteristics are the use of social networking sites and cel phones to have private communications with their victims, plying them with lots of cocaine and other party drugs, and the ethnic brotherhood mentality of the non-white gangs.  </p>
<p>Like a pack of animals attacking a weak prey, they &#8216;cut them out of the herd&rsquo; i.e. get the girls away from their race and family.</p>

		<p>One of the most engaging themes in film is the &#8220;Daughter Quest&#8221;.</p>
<p>In John Ford&rsquo;s 1956 &#8220;The Searchers&#8221;, John Wayne must battle the redskins to retrieve little Natalie Wood who has been abducted and abused by the Indians. (AFI named it the #1 Western of all time, and the AFI is comprised of liberal lefties &hellip; so we know the film is outstanding.)</p>
<p>In the 1978 film &#8220;Hardcore&#8221;, George C. Scott must delve into the &#8220;adult entertainment&#8221; industry to retrieve his 12-year old daughter who has been abducted and forced into prostitution and pornography by a Mexican named &#8220;Rattan&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the 2008 film &#8220;Taken&#8221;, Liam Neeson kicks plenty of non-White backside as he retrieves his underage daughter who has been abducted in Paris. In the final scene, Neeson blows away an Arab demon who is clutching Neeson&rsquo;s daughter as she wobbles  &mdash;  brainwashed, drug-addicted, and in her underwear  &mdash;  in the arms of the Muslim.</p>
<p>My fellow Whites, will we stand by and allow the devil to do what he wills with our daughters, or will we remember that we are the people who produced John Wayne, George C. Scott, and Liam Neeson?</p>

<p>Not much of a determent, these &#8216;Asains&rsquo; must think that the West is the land of milk and honey with nothing to stop them.</p>
<p>Makes me feel ashamed.<br>
But where we do have power is within our sphere of influence as fathers, mothers, uncles, aunties, brothers, sisters, grandparents etc. </p>
<p>We have to look after our own, because no one else is.</p>

		<p>When the war happens, which this point it is inevitable, I hope that the people that were foremost in causing the current situation are dealt with in the harshest of terms.  The mulitculturalists, the anti-whites, the marxists who decided that white western culture needed to be destroyed through unlimited mass muslim immigration must be the first targets.  </p>

		<p>Corruption at every level.  The citizens cannot even take matters into their own hands like in the old days.  And the crooks know that.  Western civilization is decaying on a global basis.

		<p>When the British National Party reported on this two plus years ago demanding official action, those in power called them the &#8220;nasty racist party&#8221; and said it was not true although the BNP said they had actual evidence.  One day the BNP may be voted into powewr vwhen all the truth is made widely public and the public made to realsie who stupid thay have been to just believe waht thay are told in the media instead checking themselves.   </p>
<p>ME? if my daughter or grandaughter suffered such a fate, my 9 mm pistol, etc. would be put to ghood use again ( I am ex-military and was a reserve policeman but not in Britain.  If official justice is not forthcoming, then the vigilantes will take over.  That is what the Marxist-minded fools fail to realise now.</p>

		<p>Apart from massively abusing British social security, importing vast amounts of heroin into Britain, burdening the NHS with the genetically deformed products of incestuous marriages,planting bombs that kill and injure dozens, what good have the Pakistanis done for Britain?<br>
 Another trend that&rsquo;s been going on for a long time now is for organised gangs of Pakistanis (often middle aged married men)to force naive and foolish White English girls into prostitution and live as pimps off their earnings.Meanwhile great pains are taken to keep their own women pure, virginal and cossetted for marriage.<br>
 Nick Griffin of the BNP tried to raise this issue years ago.The response of the British government was to attempt to imprison Griifin for &#8216;speech crimes&rsquo;. - That tells you all you need to know about modern Britain.</p>

		<p>  I get tired of the use of &#8220;Asians&#8221; by the controlled British media. You&rsquo;d think a bunch of Chinese or Japanese business men were violent pimps, who routinely abused British Children. These are Pakistani immigrants or second generation Pakistani citizens and the MSM should say so! I would hope that concerned British parents would be allowed to warn their daughters against entrapment by these greasy? predatory pimps, but that would be racism  &mdash;   wouldn&rsquo;t it? And we all know that racism is a more horrible crime than white slavery or child molestation.</p>

		<p>This is happening right here in the USA, too. It&rsquo;s everywhere, big cities, small towns, and truck stops. The gangs are Asian, and Black, and even White. The victims are frequently arrested for prostitution and then victimized again by our legal system, while the pimps face no consequences. </p>
<p>Please pray for these girls. They are our daughters, we must stop those who are abusing them. One organization that tries to help them is Shared Hope International. <a href="http://www.sharedhope.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sharedhope.org</a><br>

		<p>Old News.  First I heard of this was at least 6-7 years ago and it was well known then.</p>
<p>These little whores, often the middle children of large, lower class, working families who &#8216;dream of being more than they are&rsquo; get a Joey Potter Syndrome (boat ride to Florida for a 3 month vacation, no money required) idea that they are &#8216;special&rsquo; usually via -other- young teenaged men who are working as part of family units from SWA.  The girls are found as they stand about in shopping centers and strip malls or &#8216;hangout&rsquo; street corners.</p>
<p>Dressed for success, at night, during the school week.</p>
<p>The young men are used because they cannot be charged for sex crimes and form a cutout layer between the mark and the &#8216;patron&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Unlike UK boys who are not sexual at this age (and have no money) these young wolves are well experienced in the art of seductive compliments and typically shower the girls with praise, give them small bits of jewelry or phones (which can be used to track them to their homes in some cases) and then, _when the moment is right_ get them into cars where the financial patron (of both boy and victim) awaits.</p>
<p>AT NO TIME are the girls &#8216;unaware&rsquo; of what is happening.  The obvious intended result is usually pretty quick because the girls are themselves hypersexualized by our society.</p>
<p>This goes on for a bit and though they are effectively becoming sluts for hire, the very fact that they are sexualized gives these &#8216;young women&rsquo; now some -status- amongst their peers (which has led girls to pimp their friends too).</p>
<p>And having built their confidence with the no-consequence simplicity of the act, soon these Middle Easterners are playing the Han Solo gambit: &#8220;Sorry I don&rsquo;t have time for anything else&hellip;&#8221;.  As the sexual abandon with the boy or his patron becomes sexual -use- by many.  For profit.</p>
<p>Usually in a party environment.  It is at these &#8216;parties&rsquo; that the girls are hooked up with chemicals, knowingly or otherwise, including those which force sexual response.  The humiliation afterwards, often by video representation, is coldly calculated to break the female past the guilt-withdrawal phase that might cause her to run to mommy or the cops.</p>
<p>And into total submission.  A lot of girls, hooked on the bling or the rush, don&rsquo;t need much pushing.</p>
<p>The cops see the process, it is very explicit in terms of the girls getting into highend automobiles at known locations.  And choose to do nothing because the ethnicity is so damn singular that it begs the simpering immigrant enabler industry to cry racism, particularly among the Muslims.</p>
<p>If you want to know why the Muslims and other &#8216;Asian&rsquo; cultures hide their women, this is it.  If it&rsquo;s not nailed down, and virtuously guarded by men, it&rsquo;s a free field to plow.  Allah specifically says so.</p>
<p>Welcome to Multicult.  Get out your permission slip signing pen.  Start showing these little dears exactly what happens, by video, ex-bunny testimony and trial or forensic transcripts.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t protect them from their inner stupid.  But you can show them, explicitly, what really happens when Joey Potter comes home from Florida.</p>

		<p>I agree with everything Kenelm Digby At 3.22 said,and would like to add(for the benefit of an earlier poster),that one of the reasons white male relatives do not form lynch mobs is that in all but a few cases these girls come from dysfuntional single parent families that have no permanent adult male presence in their households.A succession of feckless drug and alcohol abusing step-fathers are unlikely to have the moral resolve to challenge these muslim gangsters.</p>

<p>By the way, check out two more great recent films about the seamy side of immigrant-driven prostitution in London:  &#8220;Dirty Pretty Things&#8221; (2003, dir. Stephen Frears) and &#8220;Eastern Promises&#8221; (2007, dir. David Cronenberg).  London might be going down the drain. </p>

		<p>One report on this sordid, disgusting use of white girls by mostly Pakistanis, affirmed that currently more than 5,000 young English girls are being sexually exploited by Muslim gangs. A politico writing in the Daily Mail recently interspersed her article on  this disquieting practice by Muslims with &#8216;It must be stressed that the majority of Muslims in Britain are law-abiding decent people&rsquo; This fearful looking-over-the-shoulder comment was repeated several times. PC has silenced many people, even on an issue as serious as this one, comment cannot be forcefully made without grovelling apologies being offered. Britain, and any white society, would be far better off without the Muslim (etc) presence.</p>

<p>This is what the British get for letting themselves be disarmed by the state. They have lost the ability to protect their families with deadly force, if necessary. They put all their faith in their bobbies to &#8220;protect&#8221; them only to find out their heads are in the sand.</p>
<p>That is why the British are subjects, whereas Americans are citizens.</p>

		<p>One quick note to our American readers: in Britain, whenever the word &#8216;ASIAN&rsquo; is used in connection with terrorism, drugs, crime, or prostitution, you can be 99.9% sure that it&rsquo;s referring to Pakistani or Bangladeshi Muslims.  </p>
<p>Just thought I&rsquo;d clear that up so you didn&rsquo;t think it was Koreans and Japanese pimping the girls.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Her mother says her pleas to police and social services fell on deaf ears. &ldquo;I used to say: &lsquo;When are you going to do something?&rsquo; They&rsquo;d say they couldn&rsquo;t do anything unless she complains, but when do you decide that a child has to complain? They said they could do nothing. She was 13. I&rsquo;d take down the number plates of cars as they drove away, but the police wouldn&rsquo;t accept them.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? For grown men to have sex with or pimp girls is a crime. It is hear in the USA and would be in the UK I&rsquo;m certain of too. So it is utterly amazing that police or child protective services won&rsquo;t do anything and they could IF they wanted to.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In order to understand it, a man MUST admit, something about men and women. Men must be dominant over women. Refusal to do so results in the above situation. &#8220;</p>
<p>I disagree with this entirely. Men should NOT be dominant over women, both White men and women need to grow a brain and take their countries back and stop tolerating this. Fifty years ago, no White man OR woman would have tolerated this. There are three causes here. First of all is the immigration of these people in the first place. Secondly, it&rsquo;s the failure of the police and social services to do anything. (I will give Texas, where I&rsquo;m from credit, if grown men were doing this to young girls here, the cops would be all over them.} Thirdly, it&rsquo;s the family. Where is this girl&rsquo;s father? (When I was 12, if a 42 year old man started coming on to me, my dad AND mom would have had their handguns ready if necessary.)Why wasn&rsquo;t the father taking care of his daughter? Why was the mom letting a 12 year old run the streets and accept gifts from grown men?</p>
