			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Kennedy, Guardian (London), August 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>From Arizona to Ground Zero via birthers, the Republicans are riding a wave of white resentment. It&rsquo;s reckless and frightening</p>
<p>The August madness into which America has descended is about several things. It&rsquo;s about the still-sputtering economy, of course, and the fear it engenders. It&rsquo;s about xenophobia, never far below the surface. And it&rsquo;s about a rightwing media-political complex that plays on the public&rsquo;s ignorance.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a unifying theme that few wish to acknowledge. What we are witnessing at the moment is the full, ugly furore of white backlash, aimed directly and indirectly at our first black president.</p>
<p>The case was made, inadvertently, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece last week by Republican congressman-turned-lobbyist Dick Armey, the godfather of what might be called the Tea Party movement&rsquo;s corporate wing. Armey and his co-author, Matt Kibbe, proudly dated the birth of the Tea Party to 9 February 2009.</p>
<p>Barack Obama&rsquo;s $800m stimulus bill was not approved until three days later. Which is my point. The most notorious political movement of the Obama era, grounded in racial fears if not flat-out racism, sprung into being within weeks of Obama&rsquo;s inauguration, before he&rsquo;d had a chance to do anything, really. If Obama was for it, they were against it.</p>
<p>The Tea Party winter and spring of 2009 led to the &#8220;death panels&#8221; of summer, and to rightwing hero Glenn Beck&rsquo;s declaration that the president harboured &#8220;a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture&#8221;. Minor issues involving Acorn, a heretofore obscure agency that helped register urban, mostly minority voters, became a cause célèbre. A little-known African American bureaucrat, Van Jones, was hounded out of office for having allegedly expressed offensive views about the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001  &mdash;  views he later said he had never voiced and did not hold. Protesters spat upon and directed racial epithets at African American congressmen as the healthcare debate reached its climax.</p>
<p>And now we come to the full fruition of all this race-baiting. According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 18% of Americans  &mdash;  and 34% of conservative Republicans  &mdash;  believe Obama is a Muslim, proportions that have actually risen since the 2008 campaign. Another poll, by CNN/Opinion Research, finds that 41% of Republicans believe Obama was definitely or probably not born in the United States.</p>
<p>Far worse is the racial, ethnic and religious hatred that has been unleashed, starting with the proposed Islamic centre to be built in New York several blocks from the devastated World Trade Centre site, which Obama endorsed and then (to his discredit) unendorsed, sort of, the next day.</p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;ve all heard Newt Gingrich draw an analogy between Muslims and Nazis, and we all know that more than 60% of the public has expressed its opposition to what is inevitably, and inaccurately, referred to as the &#8220;Ground Zero mosque&#8221;.</p>
<p>But to experience the pure fury, you have to watch this video of a black man who had the temerity to walk through a group of people protesting the centre. It is a terrifying moment.</p>
<p>There is more  &mdash;  so much more. The anti-immigration law approved in Arizona, which made a star of Republican governor Jan Brewer, notwithstanding the inconvenient truth that illegal immigration across the Mexico-Arizona border is at its lowest level in years. The political crucifixion of Shirley Sherrod. The continuing phenomenon of Sarah Palin, who, at long last, feels empowered enough to reach inside the deepest, darkest recesses of her tiny little heart and embrace a fellow rightwinger&rsquo;s repeated use of the N-word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a frightening time to be an American and to watch this insanity unfolding all around us. There&rsquo;s a sense that anything could happen, none of it good.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s all too easy to forget is that though Obama was elected with the strongest majority of any president in recent years, he received only 43% of the white vote. Now, it&rsquo;s true that no Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 has won a majority of whites. But it&rsquo;s also true that 100% of voters who would never support a black presidential candidate cast their ballots for someone other than Obama. Now they&rsquo;re roaming the countryside, egged on by the Republican party and the Tea Party and Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, looking for new objects on which to unload their bitterness.</p>
<p>The traditional media, built as they are on the notion of fair-minded coverage of equally responsible, equally reasonable political forces, can barely process what&rsquo;s going on. You literally cannot understand the current moment without watching the political satirists Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. But, hey, they&rsquo;re only comedians.</p>
<p>Not that there&rsquo;s anything new about the Republican party&rsquo;s playing racial politics. Richard Nixon was elected in 1968 on the basis of his infamous &#8220;southern strategy&#8221;, designed to appeal to white voters alienated by the historic civil-rights legislation shepherded through Congress by Lyndon Johnson. Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1980 campaign against the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter, in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil-rights workers had been murdered, by invoking the toxic phrase &#8220;states&rsquo; rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>As the economy slides into another trough, with no prospect of another stimulus passing political muster, it&rsquo;s only going to get worse.</p>
<p>Strangely, there are virtually no political observers who hold out the prospect that the folks whom the right has alienated will turn out to vote against the Republicans this November. George W Bush, after all, worked mightily to appeal to Latino voters. That&rsquo;s gone. Bush even won 70% of the Muslim vote in 2000. That&rsquo;s long gone.</p>
<p>The Republicans hope to ride the white backlash back to power, and perhaps they will. But they may also find that the hatred they have embraced will come back to haunt them this November  &mdash;  and well beyond. For the rest of us, though, the consequences of that hatred have yet to play out.<br>

		<p> The Guardian is a muckraking tabloid. There will always be people that will always believe that opposition to Obama&rsquo;s policies must come from racism. They have to say that because they can&rsquo;t actually defend those policies and keep a straight face.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s look at obama&rsquo;s &#8220;past&#8221;.  Born in kenya  &mdash;  this does not exclude him from being a natural born citizen IF a consular certificate of birth is obtained by the American parent at the nearest US embassy.<br>
Registered as a muslim in kenya.  People in kenya say that he was born there  &mdash;  a true &#8220;native son&#8221;.<br>
Attended college under scholarships that were only awarded to FOREIGN students.<br>
Travelled to pakistan and other muslim counties on WHOSE money and with a foreign passport.<br>
Possesses half-a-dozen &#8220;social security&#8221; numbers.<br>
Fluent recitation of the muslim &#8220;call to prayer&#8221; calling it &#8220;the most beautiful sound&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;my muslim heritage&#8221; and my muslim faith&#8221; as well as the 57 (muslim) states.  <br>
In his book &#8220;dreams of my father&#8221; stated that if the winds changed direction, he would &#8220;side with the muslims&#8221;.<br>
Friends, LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE.<br>
A hawai&rsquo;ian &#8220;birth certificate can be obtained by anyone who lives there, NOT necessarily born there.<br>
The &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; as well as the so-called republicans recoild in anger if any one brought out obama&rsquo;s muslim &#8220;past&#8221;.<br>
If it walks like a duck, quacks like a (muslim) duck, it must be &hellip;<br>

		<p>The guardian is an extremely &#8216;liberal&rsquo; newspaper.<br>
It is a bit of a joke in the UK. <br>
This is exactly the type of story they print regualry. If you vote for anybody who is not black you are racist. You drive? you are a planet killing moron who should be put to death. You don&rsquo;t give half your wages to African charities? you should be burned at the stake for crimes against humanity etc etc</p>

		<p>Well, we see what has become of London already. It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me there are an abundance of idiots there. He helps to give his country away. Maybe he is resentful that Americans aren&rsquo;t giving theirs away fast enough. </p>
<p>Obama is the biggest buffon I have ever seen. He is an utter disgrace to this country. American has got to turn this around.</p>

		<p>I wish it were true that a huge black backlash was going on out there but unfortunately the statistics don&rsquo;t bear it out.  Instead the numbers reveal Obama is falling in the polls at pretty much the same rate among white voters as past Presidents in tough economic circumstances.  The only real racism I see is among blacks, who voted 90% for Obama but despite the normal fall in polling approval that blacks  have also demonstrated in the past under similar circumstances, they instead  support Obama at the same  90% level.</p>

<p>This man is an amazing example of abject stupidity.  I would add that he is ignorant as well, but I doubt he would understand the situation if it were explained to him, so &#8220;stupid&#8221; is certainly the right word. Every Brit should be embarassed to have such a moron advertising to the world how dumb he is.  I know it embarasses me when someone here does the same.</p>
<p>I hope he can hold on to his illusions when the civil war starts in his area, because he&rsquo;s going to need something to fall back on when the non-whites start whupping up on his head because he&rsquo;s a white boy.</p>

		<p>Articles like this don&rsquo;t really phase me anymore, not even when they lie and misrepresent like this one.  Too many people know the truth and this playing the race card is a desperate attempt to get white people to shut up.  The this guy is going to a foreign newspaper to spout this is even more pathetic.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What we are witnessing at the moment is the full, <b>ugly furore of white backlash</b>, aimed directly and indirectly at our first black president&#8221;.</p>
<p>Notice how in the public eye, Whites can do nothing collectively in a positive context ever, while with Blacks it is the same rule but in reverse.<br>
Or try asking any lefty &#8220;what are black&rsquo;s best at?&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll no doubt get a long list of accomplishments real or imagined, and then ask &#8220;what are White&rsquo;s best at?&#8221; (And then listen to the tumble weeds blow by).</p>
<p>Muslims in the Middle East think Obuma is a Muslim because his middle name is Hussein for goodness sakes.<br>
&#8220;Of course he is&#8221; is their reaction, but in our world we&rsquo;re racists for thinking such a thing. </p>
<p>The GOP dodging Rev Wright in McCain&rsquo;s campaign, &#8220;a nation of cowards&#8221;, Sgt. James Crowley arresting Gates &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; and &#8220;the wise Latina&#8221;.  <br>
White Americans have race, race, race beaten over your heads daily, but dare to get involved the conversation and you&rsquo;ll end up  being<i>the racist</i>.</p>
<p>That brewery killer Omar Thornton, killed eight, I say again eight(!) of his co-workers and depending on who you listen to, this was a result of him enduring pent up racism and again his murdorus reaction was justified in some quarters.</p>
<p>Yet when Whites show any sort of civilized political collectivism as a reaction to their constant &#8216;reverse&rsquo; racist attacks, the result is that the White backlash is an <b>ugly furore</b>. </p>
<p>Maybe we Whites are finally waking up to the fact that we actually have nothing to apologise for. <br>

		<p>I can just imagine what British readers must think when they read that anti-Obama people (like me) are &#8220;roaming the countryside&#8221; looking for targets for our bitterness!  And, in the U.S., metrosexuals must be shaking in their sandals, wracked with nightmares of pitchfork-wielding peasants invading the cities!  The left keeps shreiking that we will be sorry, sorry, sorry for what we&rsquo;re doing!  So, if we will, what don&rsquo;t they just shut up and let us do our worst?</p>

<p>Just when I think that nothing is left for the Reds to shock and amuse me with, out trots a duplicitous maypole dancer Pollyanna like this Comrade Kennedy. If one needs a lesson in projective anxieties and pejorative sanctimony, you have it right here.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, the multicultural Bolsheviks in this country have practiced nothing but the politics of hatred and genocidal outcomes for the last 65 years. They did not embrace Comrade Obama so rapturously because he was an outstanding individual of achievement, they did so because he was a Mulatto Marxist and Muslim (even if he bends himself into Arabic alphabetic squiggles to avoid these facts;) he was their 3Ms for a successful American-style cultural revolution, that was directly aimed at first dominating and then eventually destroying &ldquo;whitey.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Now that whites in the USA seem to be showing just a modicum of solidarity and sanity, their Berlin Wall of &ldquo;Tolerance&rdquo; is seen as crashing down.</p>
<p>Oh what a pity!</p>

From the newspaper of record, the New York Times:</p>
<p><i>But it is a mistake to conflate his African identity with his Muslim heritage. Senator Obama is half African by birth and Africans can understandably identify with him. In Islam, however, there is no such thing as a half-Muslim. Like all monotheistic religions, Islam is an exclusive faith. </i></p>
<p><i>As the son of the Muslim father, Senator Obama was born a Muslim under Muslim law as it is universally understood. It makes no difference that, as Senator Obama has written, his father said he renounced his religion. Likewise, under Muslim law based on the Koran his mother&rsquo;s Christian background is irrelevant. </i></p>
<p><i>Of course, as most Americans understand it, Senator Obama is not a Muslim. He chose to become a Christian, and indeed has written convincingly to explain how he arrived at his choice and how important his Christian faith is to him.</i> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/opinion/12luttwak.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/opinion/12luttwak.html</a></p>
<p>According to the NYTs, MUSLIMS believe once born a Muslim, you&rsquo;re a Muslim for life; there is no conversion allowed in Islam.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>

But they may also find that the hatred they have embraced will come back to haunt them this November &mdash; and well beyond. For the rest of us, though, the consequences of that hatred have yet to play out.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Republican hatred bad. Liberal-progressive hatred constructive, noble, and good.</p>

		<p>This article makes some good points but simplifies the issue into little more than &#8216;racism is to blame for opposition to Obama.&rsquo;  Put racism aside for a moment (and I agree there are some who don&rsquo;t like obama because of his race) and consider the greater existential question that more and more Americans are becoming aware of.</p>
<p>Basically, every day we&rsquo;re told that our nation will turn into a non-white, majority latino nation by the time our grandkids are adults.  We&rsquo;re told that it is inevitable and that we had better suck it up and fall in line with it.</p>
<p>This is not a change that has been going on for hundreds of years, but for less than 20 years.  Americans are a proud people and the scourge of leftist &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;social justice&rsquo; has reduced half our young people to blathering idiots and painted our elders as clueless racists who understand nothing.</p>
<p>Why should Americans surrender their nation to foreigners?  Should Mexico surrender its identity to say, Zimbabweans by the millions?  Oh yeah, Mexico has a law against too many foreigners entering and changing the nature of society.</p>
<p>Why should we sit and watch our nation become a latino nation in our lifetimes?  Who said we have to do that?  Would you ask any other nation (at least nonwhite ones) to commit national and racial suicide?  Parents want the best for their kids and grandkids.  If we turn our nation into a drug infested gangland - and on our watch - how does that help the future of our kids and grandkids.  It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Leftists want us to shovel dung on the heads of our descendants in the name of repentance for the wrongs of a minority of some of our ancestors.  I say that it is social injustice to punish me for something neither I nor any of my forefathers ever did.  America for the Americans, Mexico for the Mexicans, China for the Chinese, etc.   What&rsquo;s wrong with that?</p>

		<p>I think I can summarize this entire column in one short sentence:</p>
<p>Any opposition to Obama or the liberal agenda whatsoever simply MUST be due to &#8220;racism!&#8221;</p>
<p>Though it appeared in the Guardian (London), the piece refers to &#8220;we Americans,&#8221; so I had to see who wrote it. The author bio: Dan Kennedy is an assistant professor of journalism at Northeastern University in Boston, and blogs at Media Nation&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, your typical college professor leftist.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also another piece on the Tea Party being subsidized by rich folks (it is ironic that most here would rather have Tea Parties be localized and populist and not coopted by monied NeoCons but&hellip;)&gt; Funny I never see pieces about left wing groups being subsidized by Soros, Hollywood, etc:</p>

		<p>Whites sometimes say they don&rsquo;t see Obama in racial terms.  I ask them, &#8220;Have you read his books about how he sees himself in racial terms? If he does, then why shouldn&rsquo;t you? Why are you denying him his identity?&#8221;</p>

		<p>We see how a micro polity like the UK is handling &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and in a country whose very mass means that, when there is a problem, it&rsquo;s going to be scaled to the size of a nation not a city state, we react to sustain what made us great.</p>
<p>Despite the reality warping of this latest &#8216;Kennedy&rsquo; to tell us otherwise, that has never been about multiracialism but rather _national_ unity.  As in being born here.  As in guarding a common interest that has no crossing roots in Africa or Mexico.</p>
<p>We see how you English, Scot and Welsh folk are doing with several hundred thousand new-slaves every year to boost your population indexes and drag down your status of living and personal freedoms.</p>

		<p> More of the usual branding of the legitimate concerns   &mdash;   yes, and fears   &mdash;   of the White majority as &#8220;racism,&#8221; &#8220;xenophobia,&#8221; &#8220;hatred.&#8221; If you&rsquo;re not enamored with Obama, you&rsquo;re a racist, plain and simple.</p>
<p> Why is &#8220;White backlash&#8221; necessarily, automatically, a &#8220;bad&#8221; thing, Mr. Kennedy? Weren&rsquo;t a lot of the votes for Obama two years ago a &#8220;backlash&#8221; against George W. Bush and the Republicans who were perceived as having puked up their own stated principals and exploded the deficit? And why, now that Obama and the Democrats have made it incomparably worse, is a &#8220;backlash&#8221; against this president and his fellow Democrats not justified?</p>
<p> Mr. Kennedy brags that, while only 43 percent of Whites voted for Obama in 2008, 54 percent of &#8220;young&#8221; White voters did. Meaning, I suppose he hopes, that this &#8220;hatred&#8221; that he professes to see everywhere on the Right, is confined to us &#8220;older racists&#8221; and will die out with us. I&rsquo;d suggest that he not bet a month&rsquo;s wages on that. The election that elevated Barack Obama was an aberration   &mdash;   not a trend. You heard it here first.</p>

I happen to kind of agree with that in that I consider any opposition to me, to be hatred (although, unlike Mr Kennedy, I like to keep my feelings quiet). The difference being (even though we have the same feelings) I&rsquo;m a bigoted, ignorant, backward, nationalist, while Mr Kennedy poses as an enlightened individual. And I suppose Mr. Kennedy is acting in a good cause. The destruction of the white race?</p>

<p>I just cannot understand the mindset of Whites that would gleefully sprint to the voting booths to vote for a race of people that holler at the top of their lungs on an everyday basis that White People owe them and they hate, literally hate the White People. They are so weak they are willing to do anything for these blacks in order to feel accepted and befriended.</p>

		<p>If a black doesn&rsquo;t have a job, it&rsquo;s because whites won&rsquo;t give him one. If a black loses a job, it&rsquo;s because whites didn&rsquo;t want him to have it in the first place. If a black is frequently absent or doesn&rsquo;t apply himself adequately on the job it&rsquo;s because whites are not treating him equally or fairly. If a black doesn&rsquo;t get a promotion it&rsquo;s because he needs to work twice as hard as whites to get by. If a black buys a defective car it&rsquo;s because a white salesman planned it that way. If a black loses an election it&rsquo;s because whites won&rsquo;t vote for him because he&rsquo;s black. You know, racism. This nonsense that Obama is criticized because he is black IS nonsense. He is an inexperienced empty suit that is in over his head. And his policies are ruining the country. The racism here is typical black racism. Blame whites for failing blacks. </p>

		<p>It has been pointed out above that the author of this article is an American university professor. He is not British, and the British are not slamming the USA. I like to think (and hope and pray) that the people at large (not the ivory tower academicians and liberal loonies) in England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are not to blame for the leftist policies of their governing bodies any more than conservative Americans are to blame for ours. I think the President has done enough to alienate staunch allies in the UK.  We &#8220;Colonists&#8221; may well need their friendship again and again.
