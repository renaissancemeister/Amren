			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicolai Sennels, EuropeNews, August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Massive inbreeding within the Muslim culture during the last 1.400 years may have done catastrophic damage to their gene pool. The consequences of intermarriage between first cousins often have serious impact on the offspring&rsquo;s intelligence, sanity, health and on their surroundings</p>
<p>The most famous example of inbreeding is in ancient Egypt, where several Pharaonic dynasties collapsed after a couple of hundred years. In order to keep wealth and power within the family, the Pharaohs often married their own sister or half-sister and after a handful of generations the offspring were mentally and physically unfit to rule.</p>
<p>Another historical example is the royal houses of Europe where royal families often married among each other because tradition did not allow them to marry people of non-royal class.</p>
<p>The high amount of mentally retarded and handicapped royalties throughout European history shows the unhealthy consequences of this practice. Luckily, the royal families have now allowed themselves to marry for love and not just for status.</p>
<p>The Muslim culture still practices inbreeding and has been doing so for longer than any Egyptian dynasty. This practice also predates the world&rsquo;s oldest monarchy (the Danish) by 300 years.</p>
<p>A rough estimate shows that close to half of all Muslims in the world are inbred: In Pakistan, 70 percent of all marriages are between first cousins (so-called &#8220;consanguinity&#8221;) and in Turkey the amount is between 25-30 percent (Jyllands-Posten, 27/2 2009 More stillbirths among immigrants&#8221;).</p>
<p>Statistical research on Arabic countries shows that up to 34 percent of all marriages in Algiers are consanguine (blood related), 46 percent in Bahrain, 33 percent in Egypt, 80 percent in Nubia (southern area in Egypt), 60 percent in Iraq, 64 percent in Jordan, 64 percent in Kuwait, 42 percent in Lebanon, 48 percent in Libya, 47 percent in Mauritania, 54 percent in Qatar, 67 percent in Saudi Arabia, 63 percent in Sudan, 40 percent in Syria, 39 percent in Tunisia, 54 percent in the United Arabic Emirates and 45 percent in Yemen (Reproductive Health Journal, 2009 Consanguinity and reproductive health among Arabs.).</p>
<p>A large part of inbred Muslims are born from parents who are themselves inbred  &mdash;  which increase the risks of negative mental and physical consequenses greatly.</p>
<p>The amount of blood related marriages is lower among Muslim immigrants living in the West. Among Pakistanis living in Denmark the amount is down to 40 percent and 15 percent among Turkish immigrants (Jyllands-Posten, 27/2 2009 More stillbirths among immigrants&#8221;.).</p>
<p>More than half of Pakistani immigrants living in Britain are intermarried:</p>
<p>The research, conducted by the BBC and broadcast to a shocked nation on Tuesday, found that at least 55% of the community was married to a first cousin. This is thought to be linked to the probability that a British Pakistani family is at least 13 times more likely than the general population to have children with recessive genetic disorders.&#8221; (Times of India, 17/11 2005 Ban UK Pakistanis from marrying cousins).</p>
<p>The lower percentages might be because it is difficult to get the chosen family member to the country, or because health education is better in the West.</p>
<p><b>Low intelligence</b></p>
<p>Several studies show that children of consanguineous marriages have lower intelligence than children of non-related parents. Research shows that the IQ is 10-16 points lower in children born from related parents and that abilities related to social behavior develops slower in inbred babies:</p>
<p>&#8220;Effects of parental consanguinity on the cognitive and social behavior of children have been studied among the Ansari Muslims of Bhalgapur, Bihar.</p>
<p>&#8220;IQ in inbred children (8-12 years old) is found to be lower (69 in rural and 79 in suburban populations) than that of the outbred ones (79 and 95 respectively). The onset of various social profiles like visual fixation, social smile, sound seizures, oral expression and hand-grasping are significantly delayed among the new-born inbred babies.&#8221; (Indian National Science Academy, 1983 Consanguinity Effects on Intelligence Quotient and Neonatal Behaviours of nsari Muslim Children&#8221;).</p>
<p>The article &#8220;Effects of inbreeding on Raven Matrices&#8221; concludes that &#8220;Indian Muslim school boys, ages 13 to 15 years, whose parents are first cousins, were compared with classmates whose parents are genetically unrelated on the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices, a nonverbal test of intelligence. The inbred group scored significantly lower and had significantly greater variance than the non-inbred group, both on raw scores and on scores statistically adjusted to control for age and socioeconomic status.&#8221; (Behaviour Genetics, 1984).</p>
<p>Another study shows that the risk of having an IQ lower than 70 goes up 400 percent from 1.2 percent in children from normal parents to 6.2 percent in inbred children: &#8220;The data indicate that the risk for mental retardation in matings of normal parents increases from 0.012 with random matings to 0.062 for first-cousin parentage.&#8221; (Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, 1978 Effect of inbreeding on IQ and mental retardation&#8221;). The study A study of possible deleterious effects of consanguinity concludes, that &#8220;The occurrence of malignancies, congenital abnormalities, mental retardation and physical handicap was significantly higher in offspring of consanguineous than non-consanguineous marriages.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Mental and physical diseases and death</b></p>
<p>The risk of stillbirth doubles when parents are first cousins (Jyllands-Posten, 27/2 2009 More stillbirths among immigrants). One study analyzed the risk of perinatal death (the child dies during its own birth), infant death (child dies while still infant) and autosomal recessive disorders (serious and often deadly genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy):<blockquote>Perinatal mortality in the Pakistani children was 1.5 times higher than that in the Norwegian children, and infant mortality in the Pakistani children was more than double that in the Norwegian children. Deaths due to autosomal recessive disorders were 18 times more common in the Pakistani children. Similarly, deaths due to multiple malformations, which may be part of unrecognized autosomal recessive syndromes, were 10 times more common. (BMJ, 1994 Infant death and consanguineous marriage.)<br>
</blockquote>There are also evidence suggesting that inbred people has a higher risk of developing mental disorders: &#8220;The clinical observations indicated that depression is very high in some communities where the consanguinity of marriages is also high.&#8221; (Indian Journal of Psychiatry, 2009 &#8220;Relationship between consanguinity and depression in a south Indian population&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Another study focused on the relationship between intermarriage and schizophrenia: &#8220;The closer the blood relative, the more likely was there to be a schizophrenic illness.&#8221; (American Psychiatric Press, 1982 The role of genetic factors in the ethiology of the schizophrenic disorders.)</p>
<p>The increased risk of insanity among children of marriages between cousins might explain why immigrant patients are stressing the psychiatric system and are strongly overrepresented among insane criminals: &#8220;In Sct. Hans Hospital, which has the biggest ward for clinically insane criminals in Denmark, more than 40 percent of the patients have an immigrant background.&#8221; (Kristeligt Dagblad, 26/6 2007 Ethnic minorities overrepresented among the criminal insane).</p>
<p><b>Implications for the Western and the Muslim World</b></p>
<p>The consequences for offspring of consanguineous marriages are unpleasantly clear: Death, low intelligence or even mental retardation, handicaps and diseases often leading to a slow and painful death. Other consequences are:</p>
<p>Limited social skills and understanding, limited ability to manage education and work procedures and painful treatment procedures. The negative cognitive consequences also influence the executive functions. The impairment of concentration and emotional control most often leads to anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>The economic costs and consequences for society of inbreeding are of course secondary to the reality of human suffering.</p>
<p>However, inbreeding among Muslims has severe implications for both the Western societies and the Muslim world.</p>
<p>Expenses related to mentally and physically handicapped Muslim immigrants drains the budget for other public services: &#8220;When cousins have children together, they are twice as likely to have a disabled child  &mdash;  it costs municipal funds dearly. Disabled immigrant children costs Danish municipalities millions. In Copenhagen County alone, the number of disabled children in the overall increase of 100 percent at 10 years.&nbps;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Meredith Lefelt has contacted 330 families with disabled children in Copenhagen. She estimates that one third of their clients have a foreign cultural background.&#8221; (BT, 10/11 2003 Immigrants inbreeding costing one million.)</p>
<p>On top come the expenses for Muslim immigrants who  &mdash;  because of different consequences of being born from blood related parents  &mdash;  are not able to live up to the challenges of our Western work market: Muslim immigrants and their descendants in Europe have a very high rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>The same goes for Muslims in USA, where the Gallup Institute made a study involving 300.000 people concluding &#8220;The majority of Muslims in USA have a lower income, are less educated and have worse jobs than the population as a whole.&#8221; (Berlingske Tidende, d. 3. marts 2009: Muslims thrive in USA.)</p>
<p>The cognitive consequences of Muslim inbreeding might explain why non-Western immigrants are more than 300 percent more likely to fail the Danish army&rsquo;s intelligence test than native Danes: &#8220;19.3% of non-Western immigrants are not able to pass the Danish army&rsquo;s intelligence test. In comparison, only 4.7% of applicants with Danish background do not pass.&#8221; (TV 2 Nyhederne, 13/6 2007 Immigrants flunk army test.)</p>
<p>It probably also explains  &mdash;  at least partly  &mdash;  why two thirds of all immigrant school children with Arabic backgrounds are illiterate after 10 years in the Danish school system: &#8220;Those who speak Arabic with their parents have an extreme tendency to lack reading abilities  &mdash;  64 percent are illiterate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No matter if it concerns reading abilities, mathematics or science, the pattern is the same: The bilingual (largely Muslim) immigrants&rsquo; skills are exceedingly poor compared to their Danish classmates.&#8221; (Rockwool Foundation Research Unit, May 2007: Ethnic students does not make Danish children worse.)</p>
<p>The high expenses on special education for slow learners consumes one third of the budget for the Danish schools. &#8220;Immigrant children are clearly overrepresented on Copenhagen&rsquo;s schools for retarded children and children with physical handicaps.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 51 percent of the children on the three schools in Copenhagen for children with physical and mental handicaps har immigrant back ground and on one of the schools the amount is 70 percent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These amounts are significantly higher than the share of immigrant children in the municipality, which is 33 percent. The many handicapped children are a clear evidence that there are many intermarried parents in the immigrant families.&#8221; (Jydske Vestkysten, 4/4 2009 Tosprogede i overtal på handicapskoler).</p>
<p>Our high level of education may also make it harder for inbred students to follow and finish their studies: &#8220;Young people with minority backgrounds have a significantly higher dropout rate at secondary schools than youth with a Danish background. For trade school education, the dropout rate among immigrants is 60 percent, twice as high among adolescents with a Danish background.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>There is great variation in educational outcomes when compared with national origin. For example, dropout among young people with Lebanese or Iranian background is far greater than among people of Vietnamese background.&#8221; (Center for Knowledge on Integration in Randers, May 2005 &#8220;Youth, education and integration&#8221;). &#8220;Among immigrant children that are born and raised in Denmark, more than a third has no education. Among native Danes it is less than one fifth that do not get an education. (Statistics Denmark: &#8220;Indvandrere i 2007&#8221;.)</p>
<p>The negative consequences of inbreeding are also vast for the Muslim world. Inbreeding may thus explain why only nine Muslims ever managed to receive the prestigious Nobel Prize (5 of them won the &#8220;Peace Prize&#8221;  &mdash;  for peace that turned out not to last for very long).</p>
<p>The limited ability to understand, appreciate and produce knowledge following a limited IQ is probably also partly the reason why Muslim countries produce 1/10 of the World average when it comes to scientific research: &#8220;In 2003, the world average for production of articles per million inhabitants was 137, whereas none of the 47 OIC countries for which there were data achieved production above 107 per million inhabitants. The OIC average was just 13.&#8221; (Nature 444, p. 26-27, 1. November 2006 &#8220;Islam and science: The data gap&#8221;.)</p>
<p>The lack of interest in science and human development in the Muslim World is also clear in the UN Arab Human Development Reports (AHDR). AHDR concludes that there have been fewer books translated into Arabic in the last thousand years than the amount of books translated within the country of Spain every year:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Arab world translates about 330 books annually, one fifth of the number that Greece translates. The cumulative total of translated books since the Caliph Maa&rsquo;moun&rsquo;s [sic] time (the ninth century) is about 100,000, almost the average that Spain translates in one year.&#8221; (Eugene Rogan &#8220;Arab Books and human development&#8221;. Index of Censorship, vol. 33, issue 2 April 2004, p. 152-157). &#8220;70 percent of the Turkish citizens never read books.&#8221;(APA, 23 February 2009 &#8220;)</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>There is no doubt that the wide spread tradition of first cousin marriages among Muslims has harmed the gene pool among Muslims. Because Muslims&rsquo; religious beliefs prohibit marrying non-Muslims and thus prevents them from adding fresh genetic material to their population, the genetic damage done to their gene pool since their prophet allowed first cousin marriages 1,400 years ago are most likely massive. The overwhelming direct and indirect human and societal consequences have been explained above.</p>
<p>Compassion for the health of future generations should be enough to ban intermarriage among first cousins. The economic and societal consequences do also count. Such a ban would also lessen Muslim immigration to the West because many Muslim families would like to be able to continue their practice of intermarriage in order to live up to cultural and religious traditions and keep wealth and power inside their family.</p>
<p>A legislative ban on first cousin marriages is a logical and compassionate imperative for both the Muslim world, for EU and our Western national governments.</p>

		<p>The only part of the article I&rsquo;m not so sure about is at the beginning where it says that Muslims have been interbreeding for only 1400 years.In the next paragraph they mention the Pharaohs of Egypt. Of course the ancient Egyptians were not Islamic but Polytheistic Pagans. So the tradition of cousin marriages may only be partly explained by their current Islamic religion. Inbreeding seems to be a long standing tradition in the mid-east and North African region. And this unhealthy practice only seems common in that part of the world. The American Indians, Hindus and East Asians don&rsquo;t have this problem to my knowledge. No wonder this part of the world is so volatile and crazy.</p>

		<p>I would believe this- and I also think that this is one of the reasons that Muslims(especially men)are coming to the US and Europe and marrying women of non-Arab or Muslim background and converting them to Islam. They are so inbred that too many further marriages in their own countries would result in genetic problems so they have to bring in new blood. My former husband (from Morocco) had epilepsy and other disorders that my family and I were sure were from inbreeding. Some of the other Arabs I knew during that time also had peculiar looks or behaviors that indicated being inbred. </p>

		<p>Cousin marriage by muslims is an unknown fact for the vast majority of Americans. Even  those who deal with them regularly,  as in the provision of social services to them, aren&rsquo;t aware of this. I&rsquo;ve pointed this out to some people I knew who worked in the social services field and dealt with muslims, and have received blank looks, confusion, disbelief and comments about hillbillies in return. And this from people with degrees who might be expected to know more. Also, let me tack on another issue to this one, that of polygamy. It&rsquo;s being practiced by muslim immigrants in the USA, although in a stealthy way since they&rsquo;ve been cued in to deny it. Multiple wives have been passed off as relatives (which may be true) . They&rsquo;ve gotten individual section eight apartments, food stamps, medicaid, etc. The phony &#8220;refugees&#8221; are the worst, in my experience.  </p>

		<p>Consanguinity has long been a practice of Jews. Kevin MacDonald in,&#8221;A People That Shall Dwell Alone,&#8221; makes no mention of negative results on intelligence as he traces the practice of niece/uncle and first cousin marriage among Jews from biblical times to the early 20th century. Surely the Jews, who have always valued intelligence, wealth, and genealogy, would have noticed a decline in IQ over time.   </p>

		<p>THANK YOU AmRen.  I have long wondered if this was a factor in why the Muslim world is currently so completely backward in all respects, especially considering that in ancient and Medieval times, Middle Eastern peoples were leaders in medicine, science, and philosophy.  Muslim inbreeding is never mentioned in the mainstream media, but I knew that it HAD to be an issue.  Perhaps they will eventually breed themselves into extinction?  Not without milking the public teat for all it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;m sure, and demanding expensive treatments and therapies for all of their recessive-trait genetic illnesses.</p>

		<p>Yes, on first reading it does sound bad.</p>
<p>But we have to remember that though we are talking about differences, this is all about PEOPLE. Some tolerance, kindness and a little Special Ed will do wonders, and show that we are all the same underneath. Some of us look different from others, and some may think faster or slower, or have a few chromosomes more or less, but we all think and we are all PEOPLE. </p>
<p>The term &ldquo;inbreeding&rdquo; to describe tight-knit families respectful of Islamic tradition is surely a racist slur and hate crime, but we must rise above such slanders. </p>
<p>The key to successful integration of a diverse society is not to carp on negatives which are trivial or nonexistent, but to remember that we are all PEOPLE and that once our diversity is accepted and celebrated, there will be no problems that we cannot overcome with our humanity.<br>

<p>Inbreeding among Ashkenazi Jews does lead to common genetic disorders, but apparently not to low intelligence. </p>
<p>Perhaps because although the gene pool is small on the whole, they do NOT marry cousins or siblings. </p>

		<p> Again we see the results of Islam&rsquo;s rigid, my-way-or-the-highway worldview. No marriage with non-Muslims makes marriage to first cousins much more likely, especially in smaller, more rural areas.</p>
<p> And they can say what they want about the reasons Muslims insist on that, but I think this is the real reason: Mohammed appears to have been a paranoid, terribly insecure man, and his followers for the past 1,400 years   &mdash;   especially the adult males   &mdash;   seem to have inherited that tendency, in spades.</p>
<p> Muslim men are literally scared to death that, somehow, some man outside the faith (and the family?) will manage to gain sexual access to &#8220;their&#8221; women. Hence, the head-to-toe covering required of women in many Muslim societies; the refusal to allow women to venture out without a male relative accompanying them; and a number of other restrictions   &mdash;   like that of keeping marriage &#8220;all in the family.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all, except that I would&rsquo;ve assumed the intermarriage rates were much higher.  Arab, Black African, and South Asian Muslims marry their first cousins ALL THE TIME (and that&rsquo;s 75% of the Islamic World right there).  However, I have read that Iranians, Turks (contradictory to this report, according to Steve Sailer), Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz have very low rates of consanguineous marriages, and they are Muslim too.  Must be a mix of culture and religion.  </p>
<p>Whatever it may be, we must keep these hordes out of the west.</p>

		<p>&#8220;On top come the expenses for Muslim immigrants who &mdash; because of different consequences of being born from blood related parents &mdash; are not able to live up to the challenges of our Western work market: Muslim immigrants and their descendants in Europe have a very high rate of unemployment.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I read this, the information, plus all the other shortcomings described, with the exception of physical deformities, seemed to be describing blacks in Western societies, because the vast, vast majority of them cannot &#8220;live up to challenges of our Western world.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the extent of inbreeding.  What it amounts to is having another population of blacks to care for like children, because they can&rsquo;t compete.</p>
<p>And the Western governments who take in blacks and Middle Easterners are doing so to increase their tax bases?</p>
<p>Somebody should do a study on why these white multicult elitists are so screwy they burden our societies unbearably.  I&rsquo;m not kidding when I say that I&rsquo;m sure some kind of genetic deficiency will be the reason for their incompetence, and lack of awareness.<br>

		<p>Inbreeding is a survival strategy among tribal peoples, where inheritance and social status depend on lineage. Much of the inbreeding in Muslim countries takes place among families who have always suffered from low intelligence and unhealthy racial hygiene; therefore the pattern is set by existing defects.</p>

		<p>I must take issue with the word &#8220;inbred.&#8221;  These people are inbred not because they reproduced with a cousin.  They are inbred because their entire family has been marrying cousins for a thousand years.  Marrying your first cousin will most likely not result in a particularly high risk to your children.  The problems start when your first cousin is also your 2nd cousin, 3rd cousin and half great-uncle.  Inbreeding is the result of generations of pedigree collapse, which looks like the problem here.  </p>
<p>People in the US used to marry their cousins too.  However, plenty of people did not, and in the practice fell out of favor.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, marrying your kin is incredibly old-fashioned and archaic.  Genetic issues aside, this practice tells me everything I need to know about these people.  </p>

		<p>Very interesting article. I had read a book written by a wife of a U.S. doctor who lived in a Arab country in the 80&rsquo;s. She mentioned that alot of the women suffer from some type of hip displacement. Much like that found in pure bred dogs. The total subjugation of Muslim women in these countries doesn&rsquo;t allow them much of a social life. All their activities are controlled including their sex life.<br>

		<p>Also with Ashkenazi Jews there has been a limited number of converts so the gene pool could have had new members occasionally. Many people who are at least culturally Jewish might only have one Jewish parent or grandparent and still consider themselves Jewish. Also, like others have said Jews generally did not marry close relatives.</p>
<p>Islam is not so much a religion as it is the worship of a culture. If someone converts to Islam they are encouraged to take an Arabic name, dress in the 7th century Arabic fashion that is prescribed by the Quran and even to start eating Arabic food. There are really no innovative beliefs in Islam, it is an amalgamation of Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian beliefs. </p>
<p>If you read Betty Mahmoody&rsquo;s book about her escape from Iran she describes many of the children as having strange or vacant expressions as well as several with physical problems. Even though her husband was a medical doctor he told her that the many cousin marriages did not lead to bad effects.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an easy solution to this problem. They simply need to stop inbreeding as soon as possible. An influx of millions of African Americans could solve this problem in short order. And these are just the kind of Americans they so dearly support and who in return love and respect them so much. Diversity really is quite a simple goal to achieve. Consider it a busing program or a move toward diversity through integration. Who would we be to stand in the way of their achieving so much progress? </p>

		<p>Given the current state of the media I think this story was designed to promote <i>miscegenation</i>. Unfortunately, stories like this are successful because people draw the wrong conclusions. There is a huge difference between <i>not</i> marrying one&rsquo;s cousin and marrying someone from another race. The first results in <i>inbreeding depression</i> whereas the second results in <i>outbreeding depression</i>.</p>

		<p>Inbreeding is a very misunderstood concept.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief (as stated by 8 above), what is very relevant is the frequency of alleles (or genetic variations) in the overall gene pool of a community or group, not what composes an individual.</p>
<p>While it is true that an individual who has parents who themselves share similar genes can be prone to recessive mental disorders, this can be undone in a snap when two such individuals (who at the same time are not that close related) marry and have children themselves.</p>
<p>In other words, the negative effects of inbreeding are themselves not inheritable, unless the immediate parents of an offspring also inbreed.</p>
<p>In the case of Islam, I fear that the damage might be more serious and not have to do much with inbreeding per se.</p>
<p>What I think had happened with that religion is that genes for aggression (including rape)and close-minded thinking were selected for, at the expense of those for civilized behavior and scientific inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>This matches closely with the prospects for survival and reproduction of people having these traits in Islamic societies throughout the ages.</p>
<p>Question the Prophet and you get beheaded. Genes for progress were eliminated ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Many of the women of conquered people were mercilessly raped and their children converted to Islam. Guess what genes the children would have acquired.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not easy to undo this kind of insidious damage to the gene pool.<br>

		<p>I think we must keep in mind that this article is discussing close-cousin marriage and not incest per se or marriage within an ethnic group.  <br>
First, as a hillbilly, let me address #4 Chicagoan&rsquo;s statement about hillbillies.  In the 19th Century, close-cousin marriages sometimes occurred, but not because it was mandated or even desirable.  Farming folks often had limited contact with outsiders and may have known few people outside their (usually large) families.  In my own lifetime, marriage to any cousin would be considered a taboo and fodder for jokes by hillbillies among themselves.  As far as intra-immediate-family incest goes, this appears to be not uncommon among the lowest, most ill-bred of hillbillies.  <br>
As for Jews, there is certainly no official mandate to marry a relative or even a member of a specific ethnic group.  Religion is what is supposed to matter, whether or not particular Ashkenazi parents are concerned that their child not marry a Sephardic Jew or not.  Certain diseases, like Tay-Sachs, is much more common among Eastern European Jews.  Now, in the huge Jewish diaspora, this is likely to be a problem only if a couple both carry a recessive gene that happens to affect a child.  Nowadays, the biggest religious concern among devout Jews is that too many Jews in general are marrying gentiles who don&rsquo;t convert to Judaism.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard it said that one reason why Islamic societies make women cover up is so they don&rsquo;t attract the attention of any men &#8220;outside the family&#8221; and spoil any family arrangements by marrying them. Marriage in Islamic societies is not about two people pledging to love each other and care for each other and any kids they have, but a business arrangement between families/clans to keep resources in the family.</p>
<p>Cousin marriage also reinforces the clannish mindset of Muslims. This mindset means that loyalty to your clan overrides any consideration of fairness to individual family memebers or your country as a whole and fosters a mistrust and enmity to outsiders&hellip;which explains a lot of why the Middle East is far from peaceful.  This mindset is utterly incompatible with the way the West works. </p>
<p>Oh, by the way, cousin marriage is also about getting family reunification visas to bring other family members over.</p>

{&ldquo;Ashkenazi Jews have a relatively narrow gene pool as well, but have above average intelligence. Why aren&rsquo;t they suffering from this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>{Inbreeding among Ashkenazi Jews does lead to common genetic disorders, but apparently not to low intelligence. </p>
<p>{Perhaps because although the gene pool is small on the whole, they do NOT marry cousins or siblings.}</p>
<p>Ashkanazi Jews are like every other European in the United States.  They&rsquo;ve interbred thoroughly with those of other European ancestry, especially in the last 70 years, and the amount of intermarriages are so great today that some Jewish groups voice their fear about the continuation of not only their bloodline, but their religion, just as whites generally express their fear that the importation of non-whites might well cause the European white to lose his genetic identity and become absorbed into other religions besides Christianity.</p>

<p> Is there a lowered quality of life for the native population?

<p>Are native-born neighborhoods and schools being systematically destroyed in the name of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;  &mdash;  diversity the native population did not ask for and does not want.</p>
<p>What about their lives?  Did anyone ask the native population how they feel about destitute, unhealthy foreign colonists being forced upon them by their government?  Are they OK with a rise in crime, an increase in foreign welfare leeches, the transformation of their homeland into a hostile land where they are not welcome?  Do they realize they are being out-bred and with the higher birth rates of the foreign colonists, THEY will be eventually a minority in their own native land?  What do they think will happen then?</p>
<p> When the foreign colonists eventually gain political power and impose their own laws, will the last of the native-born population be killed off?  Will they be eliminated by the foreign people their own government imported from thousands of miles away in the name of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;?  Most likely, yes.</p>
<p>Do they understand who their true enemy is?  Is it their own government that is destroying them or their altruism?</p>

		<p>The primary reason Muslims tend to be insane and unintelligent is because of the cultural malformations brought upon them by their religion.  Islam is a religion that fosters narcissism, extreme self-centeredness and sociopathic behaviours such as lying, arrogance and brutality and the inability to feel pity or sorrow for others&rsquo; sufferings or for one&rsquo;s own failures.  Any moral code that preaches moral relativism is going to be a bad one.  Islam does all of the above.  Plus it condones and encourages in-breeding.</p>

The results seemed apparent in some of the children.</p>

		<p>This is a post I made previously;it seems relevant to this issue also:<br>
Social justice is a fantasy of Christianity, which sprang from white altruism. Altruism is a genetic trait and can grow or be extinguished, and rather quickly I surmise. Traits such as it are dependent on its favoring reproduction; it may prove disadvantageous in an racially mixed,fractious population.Will it disappear? I refer those interested to Cochran and Harpending&rsquo;s work &ldquo;The 10,000 Year Explosion&rdquo; on mercurial genes.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the work. I don&rsquo;t go along with strong-armed eugenics such as in China (although a case could be made that because of its huge population it is an outlier and deserves exception) but the &#8220;issue issue&#8221; is just not going to disappear in North America. We have so much to lose and still have time to keep peril away.<br>
In the book the authors make the repeated point that Ashkenazim are highly intelligent, yet vulnerable to neurological disease, due to occupational stresses favoring IQ dating back to the Christian Middle Ages. I am not entirely convinced that other factors weren&rsquo;t involved in this mixed picture, including inbreeding. Certainly some of the difference in IQ was gained through losses in athleticism in the population at large, as the authors point out. <br>
One thing is sure, and that is that change will happen. If one accepts rapid genetic change in large human populations facing reproductive stresses, more than is expected. </p>

		<p>My daughter told me of a situation in which a Muslim girl was forced by her parents to marry a cousin that she disliked.  She soon had two severely disabled babies, and the male cousin abandoned her and moved out of the country.  The girl&rsquo;s parents were then saddled with the responsibility for the disabled children.</p>
<p>The family dysfunction in the Muslim world has got to beyond anything that an average American could imagine.  The above case also makes me wonder if inbreeding might be killed off by the opportunity to migrate.  I remember reading in the early 80s that better transportation in India resulted in more young men moving to the big city where wages were higher.  Once there, they often decided to save up for a motorbike rather than send money back to the village.  If they had stayed in the village, their parents would have been grabbing their money as soon as they earned it, but once they were off in the big city, it was the &#8220;honor system.&#8221;  The boys could decide how much they wanted to spend on themselves, and how much they would send home.  The bottom line was that younger couples starting having smaller families, as they realized that having a huge number of children wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a path toward a comfortable old age.</p>
<p>Something similar could happen with the Muslim families.  You force your daughter to marry a cousin, and YOU get stuck for life with the idiot grandchildren.  They may be used to living in a crowded three-generation dwelling back in the old country.  And they may get extra welfare benefits for each disabled child, but just as whites in this country make &#8220;hillbilly&#8221; jokes about cousin marriage, those who out-marry and have normal children will distance themselves from the inbreeders.  At least, this would happen if the chain migration could be stopped for ten or twenty years.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s most remarkable about this story is that in our modern era of long distance instant communication any major group could still behave as though they&rsquo;re ignorant of the perils of in-breeding.  Even were they isolated from the rest of the world entirely one would have thought that after many centuries of inbreeding someone would have put two and two together and made the association between consanguinity and less than perfect offspring.</p>
<p>Could it be that these people are even dumber than we&rsquo;d thought? And to think the Jews made their homeland right in the middle of tens of millions of these people.  What could they have been thinking?</p>

		<p>Cousin-marriage pre-dates Islam in the Middle East.  Specifically FBD (father&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s daughter) or <a href="https://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/marriage/parallel.html" rel="nofollow">paternal cousin marriage</a>, which is rare in pretty much every other part of the world.</p>
<p>There are additional problems with FBD marriage beyond the ones related to cousin-marriage outlined in this article:</p>
<p>1) You get rampant nepotism and warring tribalism based around patrilineal tribes. Quaint notions like democracy and freedom of speech will never work in such societies as <a href="https://www.isteve.com/cousin_marriage_conundrum.htm" rel="nofollow">Steve Sailer</a> and <a href="https://www.parapundit.com/archives/000113.html" rel="nofollow">Parapundit</a> have pointed out;</p>
<p>2) You get rather severe <a href="https://onrelatedness.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/on-relatedness-and-control-of-reproduction/" rel="nofollow">control of reproduction practices</a> in such societies, most strongly directed towards women.</p>
<p>Peoples who practice institutionalized cousin-marriage, and especially institutionalized FBD cousin-marriage, will never adopt Western values nor fit in to Western society (unless they stop marrying their cousins). Islam, with all its demands for submission, is really just a symptom of the level and type of inbreeding in Muslim societies.</p>

		<p>Part of the problem is that Islam is not merely a religion, but also an officially-mandated, rebranded, pre-packaged version of earlier, pre-Muslim Arab culture.  This is the way pre-Muslim Arabs behaved, and the successful spread of the religion they created served to also spread the major elements of their pre-existing culture.</p>

		<p>Not to argue, but didn&rsquo;t the Rothschild family practice cousin marriage?<br>
One would think if such a prestigious family would do so the practice would be imitated. Perhaps also the case could be made that cousin marriage was part of the social context out of which the Rothschild family emigrated. Wealth, if not titled, preservation is linked to inbreeding throughout history.<br>
I am no casting aspersions since it is clear attitudes have changed in the present day. <br>
In ages gone past Druids practiced human sacrifice yet they still gather apparently unashamed at Stonehenge on ritually important days.</p>
