<h1>Antwun Parker&rsquo;s Mom Says Son&rsquo;s a &#8216;Hero&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KOCO-TV (Oklahoma City), August 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the first time in a year, the mother of 16-year-old Antwun Parker, who was shot and killed by pharmacist Jerome Ersland, is speaking publicly.</p>
<p>According to police, Parker and a friend tried to rob the pharmacist at gunpoint in May 2009. Investigators said Ersland knocked Parker to the ground with one shot to the head, grabbed a different weapon and fired five more shots into his chest and abdomen.</p>
<p>&#8220;A coward is someone who will kill someone when they&rsquo;re done,&#8221; said Parker&rsquo;s mother, Cleta Jennings. &#8220;That&rsquo;s not a hero. The real hero here is Antwun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennings said that while her son did go into the pharmacy with a gun, she believes other people put him up to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he was scared to death,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know Antwun was scared to death when he had to go into that pharmacy not under his own will.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with KOCO, Jennings said she was angry when she found out two pathologists with the Oklahoma County Medical Examiner&rsquo;s Office filed conflicting statements, which call the former chief&rsquo;s ruling into question. That ruling could affect the District Attorney&rsquo;s decision to prosecute.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jennings said her son will never have a chance to prove his innocence.</p>
<p>&#8220;He still should have had a chance to go to court and defend himself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&rsquo;s just like everybody else, innocent until proven guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not a masked robber. His name was Antwun Parker. He was a human.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she may file a civil lawsuit against Ersland if she&rsquo;s not happy with the course of action in the criminal case.</p>

		<p>MISS Jennings, if your son Antwun PARKER had lived to defend himself in court the pharmacist would be dead.  Sorry, but the pharmacist is a much more valuable member of society than your son could ever have been.  You walk into a shop with a gun for only one reason and that is to rob the place.  Your son was a violent criminal and we as a people are better off with him dead.  Yup, we are much better off without Antwun walking the streets or, quite frankly, walking the cell block.</p>
<p>And under what grounds would there be for prosecution?  That the pharmacist shot Antwun too many times?  When you are under attack you do what you must to preserve your own life.  You do not have time to stop and think &#8220;gee, was one bullet enough?  Should I stop now?&#8221;.  Give the pharmacist a parade!</p>
<p>The real culbrit here is MISS Jennings.  Perhaps if she had raised her sone right, or if she had at least picked out a half-way decent sperm donor, maybe Antwun would have turned out better.  Sorry lady, you chose to give birth to an illegitimate child and you chose to raise him to be a thug, the blame starts with you!<br>

		<p>This is one of the more extraordinary comments I&rsquo;ve seen lately. The woman&rsquo;s son was a hero for trying to stage a stick-up in a drugstore, that it took great courage for him to become an armed robber?</p>
<p>How does one communicate at all with people whose values are that twisted and perverse?</p>

His achievements?  What are those, exactly?  Let me guess - his Kindergarten Graduation picture will feature prominently.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Jennings said her son will never have a chance to prove his innocence.&#8221;<br>
And no doubt Antwone had a viable defense, because Auntewon was a good boy turning his life around and was simply participating in the &#8220;guns for Tylenol&#8221; program, he was trying to get some badly needed medicine for his grandmother, and when he found a gun in the bushes he brought it straight to the nearest pharmacy where all he wanted to do was trade the rusty weapon made by the white company Smith and Wesson for a small bottle of 200mg. Tylenol for his invalid grandmother, but instead was shot dead for no other reason but the color of his skin.<br>
Any parent would be proud to have a hero like Anteywoine for a son</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been following this story since it happened a year ago.  IMHO, justifiable homicide.  The only reason the Oklahoma County DA is &#8220;considering&#8221; prosecution is because Oklahoma County has a significant contingent of black voters.  AMAF, murder charges were filed against the pharmacist.</p>
<p>Even if the pharmacist isn&rsquo;t convicted of murder, there is still the matter of a civil lawsuit, which is alluded to in this article.  That will be expensive to defend against, and at the very least, his insurance rates will go sky high.  Prediction:  This pharmacy will soon close.  Then this black woman will complain about how there are no businesses in her neighborhood.</p>

		<p>What the promoters of multiculturalism left out was that different cultures may have values that conflict with each other. In her culture armed robbery, using a gun to threaten someone&rsquo;s life, is not so bad. Maybe to her it&rsquo;s just a part of growing up, kids being kids. If the victim occasionally gets murdered, well, it&rsquo;s just unfortunate. However, in our culture armed robbery is considered very bad. People don&rsquo;t want to think they could lose their life unexpectedly, just going about their business, at the hands of some creep. If the robber dies it&rsquo;s because they chose a dangerous hobby. It&rsquo;s just a clash of cultures; our values and theirs.  </p>

<p>Another way of saying &#8220;he just fell in with the wrong crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>My bet is that the &#8220;other people that put him up to it,&#8221; if true, were at least 18, and outsourced the potentially homicidal dirty work to someone under 18 that couldn&rsquo;t get the death penalty.</p>
<p>BTW, those &#8220;other people&#8221;   &mdash;   don&rsquo;t they have mothers that will also defend them by saying they just fell in with the wrong crowd?  Every thug just happened to fall in with the wrong crowd; obviously, there must be no &#8220;wrong crowd&#8221; to begin with.</p>

		<p>Low-IQ blacks have been yapping idiotically like this for centuries, and only for about a half century or so has any white person even listened to such drivel.  As far as I know, in most if not all states, someone can kill an attacker who threatens to rob (as well as rape or murder).  Surely this must be so in OK.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know he was scared to death,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;I know Antwun was scared to death when he had to go into that pharmacy not under his own will.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I am a college student who is studying to be a psychologist. We have a term in psychology for the sort of reasoning I quoted; it&rsquo;s called rationalization, a fallacious defense mechanism where some one masks bad behavior by making excuses as a means of avoiding reality. The DSM provides a more technical explanation and says that rationalization takes place &#8220;when the individual deals with emotional conflict or internal or external stressors by concealing the true motivations for his or her own thoughts, actions, or feelings through the elaboration of reassuring or self serving but incorrect explanations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did some one put a gun up to Antwun&rsquo;s [sic] head and force him to rob a good man at gunpoint? Did some invisible, non-existent demon or space alien enter his brain and make him do it against his will? Even more ridiculous is the idea that Antwun [sic] was &#8220;scared to death.&#8221; Anxiety is a powerful mechanism that is a means of feeling the anticipation of fear; and if his anxiety was so profound, he wouldn&rsquo;t have robbed the pharmacist at gunpoint in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He was not a masked robber. His name was Antwun Parker. He was a human.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quit rationalizing and denying reality, Cleta. Your son was a violent criminal who put a good man&rsquo;s life in peril, like it or not.</p>

		<p>In the years to come, we will see the Antwun Parker Memorial Midnight Basketball Program, the Antwun Parker Academy for High-Achieving Students, and Antwun Parker Blvd.  The great legend of Antwun Parker will be told again and again and again for decades in the news, magazines, TV, Rap, church services, protests, and political rallies.  Textbooks throughout our Nation will add Antwun to the long list of other great African-Americans who have helped make America what it is today.  Mothers will tell their children and Grandmothers will tell their grandchildren.  </p>
<p>We will never forget you Antwun; neither your greatness nor your  many contributions to our society.  Cut down in his youth by a racist White.  When will the hate end?</p>

		<p>The media is responsible for their attempt to make this lowlife a hero by interviewing the low IQ mother and printing her comments and not criticizing them in any way.  Doing this conveys the image that this Black youth was some sort of &#8220;hero&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m surprised the media didn&rsquo;t portray the pharmacist as some sort of villain, or may the media did.  We need more people like Mr. Ersland.  We all need to be able to carry firearms to protect ourselves. </p>

		<p>Ms.Jennings is a fool and her son got what he deserved. Our media even letting her have a voice, calling her son a hero, is just more proof of how even common sense is becoming a thing of the past in this country with nobody expecting anyone to take responsibility for their actions. With his mother&rsquo;s sick way of reasoning it&rsquo;s no wonder Parker picked up a gun and attempted a robbery. But what would really be unforgiveable is any Judge that would let this woman sue Parker&rsquo;s victim without admonishing her and throwing the case out of court.   </p>

		<p>What I do not get is the &#8220;second gun&#8221;. If Mr. Ersland felt compelled to keep a second gun, the hood must indeed be bad.<br>
The way I gather it is he was held up by two at gunpoint, dropped one with what he was carrying (probably small pistol), then went for the shotgun; dispatched the one on the ground - but he DID NOT shoot after the other.<br>
I fail to see any malfeasance here, not even overreacting.<br>
But we all know how a &#8220;Antwun v. Ersland&#8221; civil lawsuit will end.</p>

		<p>Mr. Ersland appears to have made a sound tactical decision; apply force until the threat has ceased. <br>
Mrs. Jennings has the common lament among the mothers of these dead pieces of trash.  A couple of years ago a wanted felon (black) was pursued by police here in my area.  The vehicle chase ended, felon exits shooting, police kill felon.  Mother appears on the news asking &#8220;why didn&rsquo;t they just shoot him in the legs.&#8221;   These people are really that stupid.</p>
<p>Mr. Ersland is white and he committed the most hateful crime of all to blacks, and that is that he not only survived, but he took out those who would prevent him from being free to live his life.  The system now conspires to finish the work of &#8220;po&rsquo; antwuan.&#8221;</p>

<p>If this had happened in Chicago, the newspapers (Libune and Slum-Times) would say that the perp: 1) was turning his life around, 2) liked to make people laugh, 3) wanted to play in the NBA, and was paying more attention to his two young children.</p>

		<p>@ nokangaroos You can defend yourself, but not agress.  The trial, or lawsuit, would be based on Mr. Ersland having gone from being defensive, and justified, to aggressor and unjustified.  The idea is that the robber was already down and disabled when Mr Ersland shot him again.</p>

		<p>There is a great court room scene in a pretty good movie called &#8220;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.&#8221; A defense lawyer in the opening statement of his representation of man charged with murder while defending his own home says &#8220;When I look at the circumstances, I think to myself there, but for the grace of God go you or I. You know why? Because I God-d*** guarantee you, someone comes into my home and shoot at me, I will shoot back. And I&rsquo;ll shoot back again and again and again until I&rsquo;m sure that they are dead. Until I&rsquo;m sure that my home and family are safe. And then, old Finley here(the DA)would be prosecuting me. And my life would be in the hands of good folks like you.&#8221; The good doctor did what he had to do. Hopefully, the good folks will prevail. </p>

		<p>The only way I would feel sympathy for the dead guy is if he had been standing around when ANOTHER GUY pulls out the gun and tried to rob the pharmacy.. I have to say I don`t agree with the law that says &#8220;participating&#8221; in a situation makes one as culpable as the perpetrator.<br>
  My &#8220;convictions&#8221; (pun intended) came about the mid-nite I was standing around another kid from our school in a liquor store parking lot. He picked up a huge rock as if to break a $5000.00 piece of plate glass. When I admonished him not to, he grinned at me and hurled the missle. As I raced from the police car on foot toward the woods I promised to get a better class of friends if given the chance to get home and sleep in my own bed&hellip;</p>

Ironically, the second part of what you wrote is true. He IS one of the AAs who made America what it is today. <br>
His death will have unintended consequences: a few less innocent White people will be murdered, raped, beaten and otherwise brutalized now that Antwun is in Hell.</p>

		<p>Well, that pharmacist is lucky he doesn&rsquo;t live in Chicago.  Mayor Richard M. Daley is so angry over the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling that Chicago&rsquo;s gun ban is unconstitutional(McDonald vs. City of Chicago)that he might try and proscecute Mr. Ersland.  King Richard doesn&rsquo;t trust law abiding citizens in owning firearms.  His rubber-stamp City Council has now passed new restrictions that make it even more difficult to buy and/or own a handgun in the City.  But getting back to the case at hand, there is no way you can fathom the thinking apparatus of the young gunman&rsquo;s mother, Mrs. Jennings.  Nobody forced a gun into the kid&rsquo;s hands and told him to rob that drug store.  Mr. Ersland did the right thing and defended himself and his property.  A bullet fired by a ten year old is just as deadly as one fired by a forty year old man or woman(for that matter).</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;I know Antwun was scared to death when he had to go into that pharmacy not under his own will.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Really?  Then under whose will <i>was</i> he acting?  Was he possessed by demons?  Directed by alien masterminds?  Strange, how the concept of personal responsibility for one&rsquo;s actions is such an incomprehensible concept to blacks.  Each and every one of their acts of brutality and failure has simply <i>got</i> to be someone else&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;A coward is someone who will kill someone when they&rsquo;re done,&rdquo; said Parker&rsquo;s mother, Cleta&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, Cleta.  A coward is someone who walks into a pharmacy with a deadly weapon with intent to rob and kill.  Yo&rsquo; po&rsquo; l&rsquo;il Antwun was a coward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think my stomach could handle a celebrity campaign to &#8220;free Antwun.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;For the first time in a year, the mother of 16-year-old Antwun Parker, who was shot and killed by pharmacist Jerome Ersland, is speaking publicly.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to police, Parker and a friend tried to rob the pharmacist at gunpoint in May 2009. Investigators said Ersland knocked Parker to the ground with one shot to the head, grabbed a different weapon and fired five more shots into his chest and abdomen.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
My guess is that Jerome Ersland has been robbed at gun point before.  That is why he wanted to make sure Antwun Parker was dead.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;As far as I know, in most if not all states, someone can kill an attacker who threatens to rob (as well as rape or murder). Surely this must be so in OK.&#8221;     &mdash;  oldwhitelady</p>

		<p> &#8220;I am a college student studying to be a psychologist. We have a term in psychology for [this] sort of reasoning; it&rsquo;s called rationalization: a fallacious defense mechanism where one masks bad behavior by making excuses as a means of avoiding reality.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
If there&rsquo;s one thing blacks do well, they are absolute MASTERS at rationalization!  They are also superb at avoiding reality.  (Just ask any landlord or debt collector!)</p>
<p>I suspect this is one reason why they are so superstitious and so many blacks are given to belief in magic. That is, they think if you believe in anything HARD ENOUGH, it will become so.  Thus, believing can create reality. </p>
<p>And therefore, this mother BELIEVES that her son is innocent and even a &#8220;hero&#8221;(!!!)   &mdash;   and so, to her, in her mind,  HE IS!</p>

		<p>&#8220;letting her have a voice, calling her son a hero, is just more proof of how even common sense is becoming a thing of the past in this country with nobody expecting anyone to take responsibility for their actions.&#8221;   &mdash;   Tired<br>

&#8220;The media are responsible for their attempt to make this lowlife a hero by interviewing the low IQ mother and printing her comments and not criticizing them in any way&#8221;   &mdash;   Awakened</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Thank you. I was about to say something similar. The media were irresponsible in allowing her to say, unquestioned, that he went in there, not under his own will, that &#8220;other people put him up to it&#8221;.</p>
<p>They should not have allowed that statement to stand, unchallenged. Terrible reporting!  The reporter should immediately have pounced on that and asked her to explain just what she meant by &#8220;other people&#8221;, and should have persisted in getting an answer.</p>
<p>And also, they gave her, this undeserving woman, a public voice ONE YEAR AFTER the incident!   How many white victims (true victims) are given even a paragraph, or remembered at all,  just one week after their demise?</p>

		<p>I hope that legions of lawyers come forward (pro bono) and provide Mr. Ersland every defense known to mankind. Temporary insanity seems to be appropriate for this case, perhaps he was so enraged at being repeatedly robbed and his life threatened that he had a momentary loss of sanity.</p>
<p>Of course the defense will claim it was either a hate crime or the start of a racist genocide.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The way I gather it, he was held up by two at gunpoint, dropped one with what he was carrying (probably small pistol), then went for the shotgun; dispatched the one on the ground - but he DID NOT shoot after the other. I fail to see any malfeasance here, not even overreacting.&#8221;   &mdash;   nokangaroos</p>
<p><br>
Much is incomplete in this story. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll never know.<br>
If the felon was on the floor, completely immobilized or dead, and the pharmacist (perhaps over-reacting, but understandably) pumped a few more into him to make sure, that might have been overdoing it.</p>
<p>However, if the felon was struggling and about to get up, was the pharmacist going to let him get up and come after him again? Of course not! So it was justified.</p>

		<p>The truth of the matter is that you can be shot just as dead by a 16 years old kid that&rsquo;s scared to death as by a 30 year old hardened criminal.</p>
<p>Your chances of survival by a hardened criminal are probably a lot better because he won&rsquo;t be scared and will fell that he is in control of the situation because he knows what he&rsquo;s doing. </p>
<p>The most dangerous situation in the world is a kid with a gun that doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing. </p>
<p>Someone should be prosecuted for this young man&rsquo;s death not the man that shot him because he was only defending himself. Put the blame where it belongs put the blame on the people that sent this kid in to rob the store and prosecute them for murder, they do deserve it. </p>

<i>&#8220;Mr. Ersland appears to have made a sound tactical decision; apply force until the threat has ceased.  A couple of years ago a wanted felon (black) was pursued by police here in my area. The vehicle chase ended, felon exits shooting, police kill felon. Mother appears on the news asking, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t they just shoot him in the legs?&rdquo;</i> - JT</p>
<p>Police are not expected to be expert marksmen (like Annie Oakley or the Lone Ranger, or some character out of movie) who can hit someone&rsquo;s wrist or shoot a gun out of someone&rsquo;s hand.  Police are trained to STOP deadly force. Period.  When they are confronted with deadly force, they use deadly force. </p>
<p>&#8220;This whole crazy story, especially the mother, is right out of the Twilight Zone.&#8221; - Anon.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nothing unusual at all, with blacks.<br>

&#8220;@ nokangaroos You can defend yourself, but not agress. The trial, or lawsuit, would be based on Mr. Ersland having gone from being defensive, and justified, to aggressor and unjustified. The idea is that the robber was already down and disabled when Mr Ersland shot him again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pharmacist should not have stopped shooting. He must have had more than one round in the first gun. Although the ME&rsquo;s office could determine the fatal shot I don&rsquo;t think that they would be able to tell in what order the shots were fired.<br>

		<p>Judging by mom&rsquo;s faulty logic, I would guess that Antwun&rsquo;s head was probably operating on pretty low wattage. If it hadn&rsquo;t been Jerome Ersland it would have been someone else. If it wasn&rsquo;t that day it would have been some other day.<br>

		<p>A few years back the case of tony Martin was controversial in Britain.<br>
 Martin, had shot and killed a juvenile (White) burglar in the back as he fled from Martin&rsquo;s premises.<br>
 Tony Martin was dulely charged with manslaughter by the british courts and served time in prison.<br>
 There was uproar in Britain over the case, with public sympathy firmly for Matin.Most particularly, there was a flood of sympathy from the USA, where a many correspondents made comments to the effect of &#8220;This would never, ever happin the USA - no US court would even dare to consider prosecuting a man who killed a burglar invading his property&#8221;.<br>

		<p>I remember a similar case in LA in the early 90s (in the fraught days before the Rodney King riot in fact), in which watch-store owner, Lance Thomas, shot and killed one attempted armed robber after another, until he &#8216;bagged&rsquo; something like a dozen, and the dolts would STILL keep coming and try to rip Thomas off.<br>
 Lance Thomas was never ever charged with anything.I believe he finally shut up shot and moved to an internet only watch dealing business after one of those pathetic &#8216;LA gangs&rsquo; &#8216;put a hit on him&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>A few months ago a black man tired to rob me by pointing a revolver at me and demanding my money as he called me names. A struggle insued and I was finally able to access my 9mm. I shot several times but missed. Just yesterday a friend tod me that missing was a good thing because I avoided a costly law suit from the thugs family. I think he is right.</p>

		<p>Welcome to America, where no one is responsible for anything, but everyone owns each other, via the State.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for people to say, coulda, shoulda, woulda after the fact when they don&rsquo;t have adrenaline pumping through their veins and aren&rsquo;t under the threat of imminent death. Did the pharmacist KNOW he had hit this poor aspiring scholar in the head? Sure, that came out in the ME&rsquo;s report, but at the time, he couldn&rsquo;t have known that the perp&rsquo;s CNS was out of commission. I would venture to guess that in that situation, if young Antwun the honor student was moving at all, Ersland shot him until he stopped moving because in that hyperactive state (from being shot at by these thugs!), then movement=threat and you shoot until there is no threat=no movement.</p>

<p>That story hits all the usual notes - the dead miscreants&rsquo; mother even says that he &#8220;fell in with the wrong crowd&#8221;.  What she fails to mention is that he himself was the wrong crowd, and so is she.  Let&rsquo;s add up the signs, shall we?  Decedent has different name than mother?  Check.  Decedent has stupid made-up afro-name (Antwun)?  Check.  Decedent was aspiring basketball player?  Check.  Article shows school photo of decedent, in what is supposed to be a heartwarming picture of a young inoffensive tyke, but which none-the-less just looks like the mugshot of a scowling, malevolent thug?  Check.  Decedent ends up dead in a drug-store with six pills in him?  Check.
