<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This past week the NAACP, the National Urban League and other civil-rights groups collectively condemned charter schools. Claiming to speak for minority Americans, the organizations expressed &#8220;reservations&#8221; about the Obama administration&rsquo;s &#8220;extensive reliance on charter schools.&#8221; They specifically voiced concern about &#8220;the overrepresentation of charter schools in low-income and predominantly minority communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone should remind these leaders who they represent. The truth is that support for charters among ordinary African-Americans and Hispanics is strong and has only increased dramatically in the past two years. {snip}</p>

		<p>And charter schools are big failures.  Why wouldn&rsquo;t they be?  All they&rsquo;re doing is taking the same low-IQ blacks who can&rsquo;t succeed inside a regular public school and moved them into a different building.  Many charter schools turn out to be money hustles of one sort or another.</p>
<p>In Missouri, the only two jurisdictions that can have Charters are St. Louis and Kansas City.  The main organization of St. Louis City Police Officers, (the org is mostly white), wanted to start a law enforcement-themed charter school, got a proper sponsor, but the state board that certifies charters turned them down.  As far as I am concerned, charter schools can hop off and die.</p>

		<p>The constituency of these groups is in large part made up of black government employees, most of whom make a very comfortable living at it. Education schools, many of which are just mediocre, crank out a lot of blacks who become teachers. They don&rsquo;t want the gravy train to end. The ones who make middle class money don&rsquo;t give a hoot about what might be good for the ordinary person, black or otherwise. They have no hesitation in raiding the poor box, that&rsquo;s been demonstrated endlessly.     </p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t exactly a shocker. Black leaders and White liberals never ask Blacks what they want before they act on their behalf. Limo-liberals always just KNOW what Blacks need. <br>
Busing is a great example. Do you think anybody asked Black single moms without transportation what they thought about a plan for hauling their kids 20 or 30 miles from home? They didn&rsquo;t ask the ones who used to have to beg rides in my old neighborhood in North Minneapolis. Every time one of their kids got sick or had another problem in school those moms would have to find a neighbor at home in a neighborhood where almost everyone worked day shift. I worked second shift, so I met all of those moms. <br>
Blacks need to learn how to make their own voices heard by the policy makers so that they don&rsquo;t have more poorly-thought-out programs shoved down their throats by megalomaniacs who think they have a right to decide what is best for them. </p>

		<p>Charter schools don&rsquo;t do anything to raise blacks&rsquo; achievement.  Along with vouchers, this is one of biggest scams that conservatives have fallen for.  It&rsquo;s not the teacher&rsquo;s union&rsquo;s fault that black kids can&rsquo;t learn.  Harping on things like unions and public schools is just another way to avoid talking about racial differences in intelligence.</p>

		<p>Even though the teachers unions oppose &#8220;charter schools&#8221;, I wonder if a lot of black teachers secret love them so that they can teach the few students who have more than a room temperature IQ. While many may be scams, I personally don&rsquo;t have a problem with smarter than average blacks being separated from the dim bulbs when it comes to school. Since black teachers can no longer keep baseball bats on their desks, this is the next best option. </p>
<p>Back when busing and integration were all the rage (enforced almost at gunpoint by federal mandate and activist judges), charter schools would have not been allowed. I can think of two black teachers in my high school that were pretty good, but most of the others were glorified jailers. We had something of a school within a school so that the district didn&rsquo;t fall below 30% white and possibly invite the wrath of the federal government. Most of the teachers in this subsection were white and were within 5 - 10 years of retirement. Almost anyone who lived in this district and had a few bucks either moved or sent junior to a private school. </p>
<p>In a previous post, I mentioned that my wife&rsquo;s cousin is married to a man of Chinese ancestry that teaches in an inner city school district. Once, he told me of a time when he locked his keys in his car. He asked one of his grade 7th students &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to know how you do it, but get into my car and I&rsquo;ll make a disciplinary report disappear.&#8221; He got his keys back in about two minutes. This man also filled me in on the charter school scams. KIPP and its clones have the ability to cherry pick the students who have an IQ at least one Standard Deviation above the norm. The rest are booted back to the public schools when the charters have received their money for the quarter, half or year. </p>
<p>Simple solution, schools zoned by IQ, not zip code. </p>

		<p>I confess that at one time I actually read the Wall Street Journal and took seriously various &#8220;free market&#8221; reforms to help the urban poor, just about everything.</p>
<p>Then I lost it when reading the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s July 4th Editorial demanding complete open borders immigration in to the USA - demanding that the entire NW Third World be allowed to up and move in to the USA and this was somehow good for America, good for Conservatives from a libertarian perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with all the nonsense about &#8220;vouchers&#8221;, &#8220;charter schools&#8221; etc. The main reason Whites send their children to private or Catholic schools is so their children don&rsquo;t get beat up, terrorized by Black students in the public schools. Give these same Black students &#8220;Vouchers&#8221; to go to White private schools and the same process happens there.</p>
<p>I urge everyone here to get out of the libertarian conservative sandbox and think and act in an intelligent White Nationalist way - yes be RACIST. Do what is best for your White children for Whites in your area.</p>

		<p>Many charter schools are about as reputable as the various &#8220;institutes&#8221; advertised inside the covers of matchbooks.  I can cite dozens of examples of &#8220;principals&#8221; who ripped these schools off, at times leaving students high and dry in the middle of a school year. </p>

		<p>There are Blacks that want a better life and an education for their children. They want to send their children to better school. They want to take their children out of failed public schools. These are the Blacks that get labeled as race traitors, oreos, Uncle Toms and Aunt Jemimas, the 10 percent that don&rsquo;t vote Democrat.</p>

<p>Europe through Chinese eyes <br>
11 August 2010 La Vanguardia </p>
<p>&#8220;They are peaceful, romantic people&#8221;, who live in &#8220;a single country&#8221; from which &#8220;China has much to learn&#8221;, who &#8220;act responsibly when confronted by problems&#8221;, as well as being &#8220;tall, good-looking and blonde&#8221;. Such is the vision that Chinese children have of Europeans. As La Vanguardia explains, these comments are the fruit of the project &#8220;One meter off the ground: how children imagine Europe&#8221;, conducted by Spanish production company PDA on children 7 to 12 years of age attending a Beijing school. The project, supported by the EU&rsquo;s Spanish presidency, &#8220;would make the European founding fathers weep with joy&#8221;, declares the paper. </p>
