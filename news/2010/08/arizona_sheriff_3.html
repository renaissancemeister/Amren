<h1>Arizona Sheriff: Border Patrol Has Retreated from Parts of Border Because It&rsquo;s &#8216;Too Dangerous&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terence P. Jeffrey, Cybercast News Service, August 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sheriff Larry Dever of Cochise County, Ariz., one of four Arizona counties contiguous with the U.S-Mexico border, said Friday that the U.S. Border Patrol has pulled back from parts of the border in his and neighboring counties because manning those areas has become too dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you frankly have Border Patrolmen  &mdash;  and I know this from talking to Border Patrol agents  &mdash;  who will not allow their agents to work on the border because it is too dangerous,&#8221; Dever told CNSNews.com in a videotaped interview. &#8220;Now what kind of message is that for crying out loud?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dever stressed that the Border Patrolmen are ready and willing to perform their mission of securing the border, but that Border Patrol managers had determined that in &#8220;some places&#8221; the danger was too great and they wanted to avoid the risk of an international incident such as a cross-border firefight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have middle management and upper management that says: No, it&rsquo;s too dangerous right there and we&rsquo;re going to cause an international incident if there&rsquo;s shooting across the line, back and forth,&#8221; said Dever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I say: Come, bring it on. Let&rsquo;s cause the international incident,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dever said there were places where the Border Patrol had pulled back from the border in his county and in neighboring areas both in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s becoming harder and harder for our government to hide that fact that mexico declared war on us.  That&rsquo;s what it means when police are no longer sufficient to handle &#8220;crime&#8221; along a border.  It&rsquo;s not crime.  It&rsquo;s war.  And requires a military presence.  Lacking a military presence, the only other alternative is to cede territory as is being done here.</p>
<p>For the first time since this nation was founded, it has shrunk.  Land has been lost.</p>
<p>And alot more is probably going to be lost.  Because, at this point, the only solution is open warfare with mexico and the forced roundup and expulsion of mexicans&hellip;&hellip;using deadly force when resisted.  Many areas (like all of california for example) this is not possible.  The US will have to wage a protracted campaign of open warfare, from behind a new border forced upon us in order to reclaim that territory.</p>

		<p>I thought, and was taught, that &#8220;these colors never run.&#8221; I guess they do now if you&rsquo;re middle or upper management in the border patrol.</p>
<p>How odd that they are afraid of creating an international incident. What a joke. The Mexicans are creating the international incident and were are NOT responding, we are running away, avoiding, denying.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s more proof the feds fail to meet their oath of office and protect US.</p>

		<p>Most Border Patrol members still want to do their duty.  But in THE DEVILS HIGHWAY, a book about about a particularly lethal stretch of the Arizona - Mexican border by Luis Alberto Urrea, the author reports that some of the BP agents in that sector were so sympathetic to &#8220;come for work&#8221; illegals as opposed to the drug smuggler illegals that they built, on their own time, some guide towers to help illegals find their way to the closest U.S. interstate.  This they did in the the name of humanitarianism.</p>
<p>In other words, some of the people who are supposed to be protecting our country are helping the invaders for ideological reasons. And then there are the BP agents who have been bribed by the drug cartels to look the other way.  </p>
<p>But on the Afghanistan front, General Petraeus has arrived and will soon be proclaiming victory.  What a relief that will be.  </p>

		<p>The dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan was justified because it was feared, and rightfully so, that a conventional invasion would have been a blood bath.  Every man, woman and child would have fought to the death to protect their home islands and Emperor.  Mexico should have no such fears, the US will peacefully and voluntarily pull back from any border that the Mexicans decide to encroach upon.  No nasty old atomic bombs needed for our conquest.<br>

		<p>My ancestor landed here in 1754. We haven&rsquo;t left in all that time, other than to serve in the military of this country. </p>
<p>The enormous question is precisely this: Is my citizenship worth anything or not? Why should I pledge my money, my life, and my allegiance to a country that has NO interest in defending me? Why work when anyone from any country can come in and have MORE rights than I do? And force me to support THEM? </p>

		<p>I suspect it isn&rsquo;t as much cowardice on the part of the Federal managers, as it is a fear that such cross border firefights - be it between our Border Patrol and gangs/coyotes or between our Border Patrol and Mexican Federales - would sink Obama&rsquo;s plan for amnesty (or anybody else&rsquo;s) for a decade.  It would immediately anger Americans against any and all immigration legal or otherwise and the angry demand for a reverse invasion would be loud and insistent.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really useless to try to get these Beltway types to understand that refusing to take a hard stand means further and further retreat in one manner or another.</p>
<p>Whether it is posting signs in US parks near the border announcing that the area is unsafe due too illegal alien and drug smuggling or whether it is commending the National Guard for retreating when confronted by armed military elements from Mexico on US soil, it is unequivocal proof that the government  is slowly losing control of the country.  </p>
<p>Since a good portion of the self-appointed elites want a one world, open borders scenario with plenty of Democrat voters, and others want cheap labor to enrich themselves further, the situation continues to get more dangerous by the month.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that this country is dysfunctional.  The biggest mistake we made was not INSISTING on term limits for politicians AND staffers in Washington in order to keep a civilian government comprised of the people in power instead of career politicians whose main concern is getting re-elected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late to correct the situation now.  We&rsquo;re headed for an economic armageddon which will cause break up and sporadic armed violence that will spread nationally, and globally, but not necessarily in that order.</p>

		<p> So it has come to this: The United States of America, once the greatest country in the world, pulls its Border Patrol agents back from an international border because &#8220;it&rsquo;s too dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p> It would be funny, if it were not so pathetic. What are these guys, the Ladies Aid Society? Or, rather, I should say, what&rsquo;s wrong with their leadership? A bad case of political correctness and fear of being labeled &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;xenophobic,&#8221; ad nauseum, I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m with Sheriff Dever: &#8220;Come on   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s bring on the international incident.&#8221; It would probably clear the air, and maybe grow a backbone in some spineless mid-level Border Patrol &#8220;leaders.&#8221; </p>

		<p>To all of the RINO&rsquo;s and bleeding heart-Dems:</p>
<p>Softball is over. </p>
<p>If law-enforcement-officials (like Tucson&rsquo;s sheriff) and politicians (like the mayor of Phoenix and the so-called POTUS) can&rsquo;t play hardball, then they need to step aside and let MEN handle the job of protecting American citizens. This is no time and no situation for wimps!</p>
<p>I just saw a TV report on a Tucson family whose house was invaded by illegal hispanic invaders wielding shotguns. They duct-taped the wife of the house and were about to &hellip; do some irreparable damages. The man of the house ripped the shotgun away from the punks; they fled.</p>
<p>Today I saw another Arizona report of an elementary school (The Little Red Schoolhouse) three miles away from the border. The school has erected a huge barbed wire fence because of the incessant criminal traffic coming from the Mexicans.</p>
<p>Our wives are not safe in our homes. Our daughters are not safe in our schools. And our elected officials are the root cause of this issue, so come November, we go the polls and we hurl 110 mph hardballs at the invertebrates who have sold out our nation and put our wives and daughters at risk. </p>
<p>Heads up, punks!</p>

		<p>This sounds like the way we presently run our foreign wars as well.  The U.S. merely establishes a presence in a country and then tries its hardest to avoid any enemy contact.  Either the states will take up the fight that the federal government is avoiding, or we will fall like ancient Rome.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that Sheriff Dever is correct.  And you&rsquo;ll notice that &#8220;our&#8221; government considers the Mexican border too dangerous for its own flunkies, but has no qualms whatever about importing the contents of that border to the rest of amerika.</p>

		<p>Well let&rsquo;s all hope the Mexicans do start this &#8216;international incident&rsquo; that is so big the MSM won&rsquo;t be able to sweep it under the rug. That would surely put the Obama administration into the hot seat. At the very least it will be most entertaining to see what sort of spin the Prez and Janet Napolitano put on it, especially in light of her claim that the border is more secure than it has ever been.</p>

<p>1) Occupation of Mexico<br>
2) Annexation of Mexico as part of the North American Union<br>
3) Abolition of US Dollar and the Peso and replacement with a single &#8216;Amero&rsquo; type currency.<br>
4) EVERY Mexican will have the right to live and work in USA as they please.<br>
5) Spanish and English will be joint official languages.<br>
6) Why stop there? Cuba, Jamaica, El Salvador will be next until the whole of north and south America are one country<br>
6) A neo-conservatives dream come true&hellip;..yes indeed as Bush said to the Iraqi insurgent &#8220;bring em on&#8221;!<br>

		<p>If ever there was a clearer reason to have our military on the border I haven&rsquo;t seen or heard it. THIS IS OUR COUNTRY AND OUR TERRITORY! I can&rsquo;t beleive that our govt. would just walk away and not defend our territory and our people. This just proves that our govt. is run by cowards. They claim that they don&rsquo;t want to have an international incident? We already have one every time they cross our border.We already have one every time the Mexican govt. provides information and instructions on how to get across the border and what to do when they get here.Political correctness will be the death of us. The time to act is now. This invasion must be repelled and our territory must be taken back. We must do it now or things will only get worse.</p>

		<p>DOUBLE D. If you, or anyone, think the military (especially the Army) will do any good on the border, you are SADLY mistaken. The Army, from my personal observation, appears to be around 60% lazy, worthless, cowardly ghetto blacks who got a welfare with a uniform ticket. Not all blacks are thus, but most are indeed as I described them. The other 40% is basically 50 hispanic with many being non citizens, though I have respect for them as they go on patrols and suffer casualties in line with whites. Blacks are inclined to stay on camp, for one reason or another, and steadily accost white girls but as I mentioned before, even black girls are treated like that. No people, you will not be able to count on the Army for anything as a cohesive unit though some will do their jobs.</p>

		<p>Our own U.S. border is too dangerous, yet we send thousands of troops to &#8216;official&#8221; war zones in someone else&rsquo;s country, supposedly to fight (we haven&rsquo;t truly FOUGHT a war to win it since WWII). No wonder we don&rsquo;t recognize our own borders - we don&rsquo;t recognize any other country&rsquo;s borders, either. We just stride in as if we owned the place; whereas a place we actually DO own, we run from.</p>
<p>My optimism about this country&rsquo;s future has been worn away day by day.</p>

		<p>Non-management Border Patrol Agents are union employees and as such they will not work outside of their job description.  Conducting military operations in the areas mentioned by the article doesn&rsquo;t fit within their &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; duties or what they hired on to do.  Nor are they trained and equipped for squad patrols and sweep and clear missions. </p>
<p>Yet the Border Patrol does have tactical units so trained and equipped (BORTAC).  As near as I can determine, these units have never been effectively used anywhere. They could be dropped into the areas spoken of by the sheriff to conduct week long roving patrols and ambushes.  The Mexicans would learn, and soon the only danger to line agents would be from rattlesnakes. </p>
<p>But as of now BORTAC remains a club that a few agents can join for relief from the humdrum boredom of repeatedly rounding up the same illegals day in and day out. Besides BORTAC agents have the chance to play with some real neat military stuff.  </p>
<p>There is also a Border Patrol rescue unit, BORSTAR .  Its main mission is to rescue and coddle Mexican illegals before they die in the desert so they may be nursed back to health for another run at the border. </p>
<p>There are many other manpower wastes also like the hundreds of agents assigned to HQ DC in the Reagan building whose only purpose is to cover the rears of senior management.  Believe it or not the Border Patrol runs overseas missions to train foreign countries how to get control of their borders. Yes folks it&rsquo;s a fact.  </p>
<p>I have suspected for a long time that the reason that border agents are not forced to crack down on illegals is that so many agents are themselves Mexican (American).  Serious enforcement would lead to gunfights and killings of Mexican interlopers and blood brothers to Hispanic agents. This would fracture the patrol along racial lines and spark political firestorms and uprisings by Mexicans in large cities like LA, Tucson etc. So it&rsquo;s safer to arrest Jose the gardener again and again.  </p>
<p>Additionally, many if not most senior agents and managers in the Border Patrol are also Mexican (Americans).  They consequently have no real interest in stopping their cultural kin from flooding into the country.  </p>
<p>With the emphasis on quota hiring by federal agencies, it is at least likely that some Hispanic senior managers have been compromised by drug cartels. Why not?  Many still have family and close relatives living in Mexico.  How easy would it be for a cartel to threaten the extended family in return for a little key cooperation in the US. It&rsquo;s the Mexican way.  </p>

		<p>Right now the U.S. is failing at every attempt to deal with third world countries because our policies are designed to deal with leaders who actually represent the citizens of their countries. That is not the case in Mexico anymore than it is the case in Afghanistan. Third world countries are countries only inasmuch as their borders are recognized by first world nations. Within those borders are thousands of local big frogs who jealously guard their small ponds. They do not accept the authority of any centralized government and they only respect brute force. This is a reality that can be neither ignored nor altered. Design our policies around a willingness to use brute force at a local level and our international worries will evaporate. </p>

		<p>As Poster #6 points out, my own ancestors go back to Jamestown, Salem, Quebec and that puts me as five centuries worth of roots on this continent.  No small matter.</p>
<p>Yet, I too keep feeling that all of that birthright is going down the tubes for the sake of some multi-culturalist fantasy that seeks to give our nation to newcomers (most of whom are here without permission).</p>
<p>I think about it everyday.  I&rsquo;m not against immigration and I&rsquo;m not against non-whites (as long as they&rsquo;re civilized and educated and teach their kids right), I am just flabbergasted that the level of immigration is greater than our ability to assimilate newcomers now, and that this is altering the nation simply to feed the whims of idiots who feel they are above &#8216;Americanism&rsquo;.  They are the infamous &#8216;citizens of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We need to close off all immigration, deport all illegals, cancel all work visas, put a deadline for cancelling all green cards, cancel citizenship and deport any immigrants convicted of a crime or of membership in a gang, cancel birthright citizenship for children of illegals (retroactively to 30 years) and require national identity cards that police can check on demand.</p>

		<p>Can someone tell me if Americans have tried to erect sections of wall on private land?  I mean, if what is calling itself our &#8216;Government&rsquo; won&rsquo;t do it, is there something stopping private citizens from erecting walls on private land?  </p>
<p>I remember going to Ranch Rescue&rsquo;s website (before the Communist drug lords and their minions shut it down), and reading that they were opposed to &#8216;Environmentalists&rsquo;.  I guessed, then, that Environmentalists (probably after being bribed by the Drug Lords) had proscribed barriers as causing problems for migrating wildlife (yes, I see the irony here&hellip;.).</p>
<p>Anyway, I grew up on a farm, and can probably still operate earth-moving equipment&hellip;.  And I have really cute pink denim painter&rsquo;s pants, for volunteer projects, and am handy with a wide array of powertools.  I&rsquo;d guess about half the women in America have done construction work of some kind.  </p>
<p>I presume volunteer efforts like I&rsquo;m imagining have been stopped by somebody.  Who?  On what pretext?</p>

		<p>No Istavan, the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was not justified. If it was then why was a Uranium bomb used at Hiroshima and a Plutonium bomb used at Nagasaki? To test the weapons and frighten the USSR thats why! Also the weapons were used because the Russians were in secret talks with Japan to get them to surrender (the Russians all of a sudden attacked Japan after defeating Germany) and America wanted to occupy industrialised Japan rather than have the Russians control it.</p>
<p>If Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg and Baghdad were justified&hellip;then by the same token so was New York and Washington. (I hope Amren doesnt refuse to print this just because it might upset the Neo-Cons who frequent this board). Americans should be VERY careful when typing such provocative statements online. </p>

		<p>Our borders with Mexico should be fenced, kept under surveillance, and sown with anti-personnel mines.  Like the DMZ between the Koreas and the border between the two Germanies during the Cold War there should be lethal force employed to keep illegal crossers out.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, an undeclared state of war exists between the US and Mexico.  Their citizens, with the tacit approval of their government, illegally enter our country in huge numbers.  We have the legal and moral right to stop them by whatever means necessary.</p>

		<p>First you have to disable the UGS LANs and whatever satellite or UAV ROVER receive or GCS command terminals are out there on the U.S. side.  This will take the U.S. side officially out of the regulated drug/illegals trade game.<br>
Then you have to find a way to rapidly, inconspicuously, insert small (four man) teams.  I would recommend clearing remote areas behind protective masking for ultralights as they leave no ground trail, don&rsquo;t have a trackable paper log attached to an airframe serial# (like a helo).  Can be handassembled and disassembled rapidly.  And are noiseless on approach and indeed, (through delayed takeoff) until well after the teams are down and away from the LZ.<br>
Then, you need to get some old pros, preferrably with solid experience in long range engagements and valid contacts in the illegal arms trade.  MicroUAV to scout.  .50BMG and 60mm knee mortars to take out the Mexican hilltop OP &#8216;forts&rsquo;.  And claymores and 40mm plus assault weapons to put down the Coyotes and the Drug Runners, up close but not personal.<br>
Don&rsquo;t be careless.<br>
The Mexicans have both lowlight and thermal imaging so you may need to exploit insertion windows that either mask your approach through terrain or use &#8216;hot&rsquo; dusk/dawn backlighting.  Saturation with multiple teams is also important for mutual support and deceptive operations, you may well be recovering to Mexican dirt to avoid U.S. pursuit.<br>
If you feel merciful, TM the feds to come pick up the illegals.<br>
And post the same kind of agitprop videos of dead drug runners as the Iraqi&rsquo;s did back in the summer of sniping in 2006.<br>
Let there be no doubt that it is war -from our side-, including mutilation of the already dead bodies to make the horror of their passing implicit (head in hand, seated indian style on a trailhead was a favorite gurkha technique and they could wire the body to make it stay upright.).<br>
Put particular emphasis, through selected weapons employment, doctrine and leave behind signature telltales on embarrassing the U.S. Military with it&rsquo;s own incompetence.  So that every time some Mexican drug runner gets capped, and &#8216;evidence suggests special forces&rsquo;, the Feds have to explicitly deny they &#8216;are doing anything at all&rsquo;.  The American Public will get the message.  So will El Presidente&rsquo;, down south.<br>
Keep your teams compartmentally segregated and under lockdown for the length of their &#8216;tour&rsquo;, using them for a single month or so and then dropping them forever (need about a platoon sized element commit before starting).<br>
So that nobody can inform on the organization as a whole.<br>
It&rsquo;s pretty clear that nobody is going to be winning this war if we don&rsquo;t do it for ourselves people.  We cannot afford to let the preferred strategy of &#8216;wait until it quiets down&rsquo; take this off the front page.  We may be looking at our greatest chance to bring all the underlying issues to a head.  And not seeing it for what it is.</p>

		<p>Forget the Border Patrol, the Military, and the Federally controlled National Guard; they&rsquo;re not coming to save this Country.</p>
<p>The border States need to wake up, and their Governors need to call out the Constitutional Militias, which are all Citizens, between the ages of 18 and 50 years old, and have them report with a rifle and ammunition, to take fight to the invading enemies. </p>
<p>Then they should Deputize the Minutemen, and have them report, as well, to the border.</p>
<p>Outraged and determined Americans won two World Wars, fighting against the most powerful Nations on Earth. I think we can handle Mexico, without much of a problem. </p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s get to work, and save our Country. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Sheriff Dever can &#8220;bring it on&#8221; right now if he wants to. No problem to have a False Flag OP (in reverse) by just blowing away a few of the drug carriers and planting their bodies where it will do the most good :)</p>
<p>There couldn&rsquo;t have been any lack of opportunities for this already, what is he waiting for?</p>

		<p>I vote that all Border Patrol agents wear masks of either General Winfield Scott or General Zachary Taylor.  And say via bullhorns, &#8220;want some more of 1846-48.&#8221; That oughta send a message to Mexicans well educated in History 101!</p>

		<p><i>For the first time since this nation was founded, it has shrunk. Land has been lost.</i></p>
<p>Indeed. </p>
<p>Future generations may look back at these days and note this was the beginning of the unraveling of the USA, a turning point in the tide that began with the landing of English settles on the Atlantic coast and continued through the era of Manifest Destiny and global power. One can imagine a future geographer, making maps showing the mass migrations of peoples such as we see of the Goths, Franks and Vandals moving into the Roman Empire of the 4th and 5th centuries AD.  And who knows, perhaps today&rsquo;s illegal migrants (i.e., invaders) will eventually set up their own mini-states, and then one day people will shake their heads and wonder whatever happened to the United States?</p>
<p>Of course, the US government can fight a seemingly endless war in Afghanistan on the grounds that it is to protect the world from terrorism. But I&rsquo;d venture to say that the impact of illegal immigration on the USA is far greater, in the long run, than that of terrorism. </p>
<p>Now where is my copy of Gibbon?</p>
