			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Lin, Philadelphia Inquirer, August 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The mortgage foreclosure crisis has claimed an unlikely victim: Carl R. Greene, executive director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA).</p>
<p>Wells Fargo Bank has foreclosed on Greene&rsquo;s $615,035 condominium in the upscale Naval Square development in the city&rsquo;s Schuylkill section.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit filed July 27, Wells Fargo said the amount in dispute was $386,685.22.</p>
<p>Greene, 53, runs the nation&rsquo;s fourth-largest public housing agency and is one of the highest-paid public officials in the city. His salary is $306,370, and last year he got a $44,188 bonus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dorn [Kirk Dorn, a spokesman for Greene] added that Greene &#8220;knows people will find it hard to understand how he could be involved in a possible foreclosure proceeding on his home, but he would prefer not to say more about it at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like any other Philadelphia homeowner threatened with losing a house, Greene will have to participate in the city&rsquo;s mortgage-foreclosure program. He is scheduled to appear Sept. 16 in the courtroom of Judge Annette Rizzo.</p>
<p>PHA, a state authority, is funded mostly by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and is responsible for providing housing for Philadelphia&rsquo;s poor. It maintains rowhouses and apartments for low-income residents and develops affordable housing for purchase.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With the Obama administration, Greene has drawn attention and accolades from HUD for quickly putting to use economic-recovery money. In the last two years, PHA has received an additional $127 million in stimulus money that Greene has used to build or renovate 1,200 housing units.</p>

		<p>      You must give him credit. The story is about his foreclosure and not about him swindling money driven by his financial woes.<br>
     The fact of the foreclosure almost says he is not a crooked government director.</p>

<p>I suspect that any WHITE contractor/home builder could build 1,200 rather nice multi family homes with $127 MILLION DOLLARS! you&rsquo;d think he could have stolen enough to keep his home!</p>

		<p>We are going to play a little game, I want you the reader to fill in the blank, its only word missing through out.</p>
<p>I work in a similar sector in the UK and guess what ? The vast majority of housing associations that are put under control of our governing body are.. Come on guess !! </p>
<p>***** and multi ethnic. And the reasons are ????? Mainly fraud by ***** directors and senior ***** staff.</p>
<p>A housing association called Ujima is a case of distinction its the very first housing association to actually go bust. Entirely because of fraud by ***** directors.</p>
<p>These people are incapable.  </p>

		<p>Mr. Greene appears to be the perfect person for his job.  Greene has been irresponsible with his income and appears to have lived beyond his means.  However he will now have the municipal courts Philadelphia Sheriffs office and federal government take him by the hand showing him how to cut corners so he can hang on to a house the man had no business buying in the first place.  Greene can&rsquo;t keep his own house but informs others how they can apply for housing.  Obama has never owned a business but informs business owners how to run their companies.  Yes Obama and Greene are perfect for the jobs they have.  However Greene and Obama are perfect only because the former United States is now bizzaro world where everything is  bizarre, upside down and makes no sense.</p>

		<p>There are far more important things to do than pay a bill. In any case that house should of been free. The racist mortgage compay will find out as business gets hard to do in Philly.</p>

		<p>Oh, I think it is much simpler than we are imagining.  This black is merely jumping on the mortgage bailout train that Obama engineered for his black brethren.  Why should HE feel he should have to pay his mortgage, when Obama has mandated we the white American taxpayer will pay for his house through the mortgage bailout hustle?  He can probably afford his payments, just willfully defaulted so he also could jump on the freebies train.  He will now get his defaulted amount payed, the mortgage company will be forced to give him a lower rate, and accept a mandated lower appraisal value.<br>
That&rsquo;s his game.  Has anybody done the math?  127 million divided by 1100 units is 115,000 per unit.  Assume he hired shoddy black contractors to do shoddy work with shoddy materials and he has ample left over to secrete somewhere in an offshore account.  So, he&rsquo;s a crook that just hasn&rsquo;t been found out yet, and another typical black thinking he also such have Whitey pay for his mortgage at one and the same time.</p>

		<p>Black mayor plus almost entirely black bureaucracy = total government catastrophe.  Happens every time blacks control any school board, any village, any town, any city, any state, and nation, and any continent.  It&rsquo;s an immutable law of nature, a law with no exceptions, not a single one.</p>

		<p>I worked for a black-run company. Just about every vendor got stiffed on bills, often to the tune of six-figures. No one from the company would even bother to contest creditors in court. It was truly bizarre. Turns out the guy running the company had been doing this for more than a decade. Then I found out about the allegations of rape, and six-figure settlements. That&rsquo;s when I left. And that&rsquo;s when I began asking some hard questions, and I&rsquo;ve been reading this site ever since. I feel guilty about it, but I also feel like I was so intensely ignorant about certain things three years ago. </p>
<p>Not, I should add, that I&rsquo;m bitter. I worked. I was paid (not everyone was). Then I moved on. It sure was weird. I feel guilty even examining these issues, but I have an insatiable hunger for the sort perspective publications such as this one   &mdash;   which are bordering on being contemporary America&rsquo;s answer to samizdat   &mdash;   can provide. I&rsquo;m going to hell, aren&rsquo;t I?</p>

		<p>Do the math on this&hellip;his was foreclosed on with $386K in debt (sounds like a $400K initial loan).  Today, he could easily get a 5% loan for 30 years, or 4% for a 7/1 ARM.  His payments would be $1,600 - $2,000 per month, plus say, $500 per month for taxes and insurance, so $2,500 per month, max.</p>
<p>If he made $360K last year, or take-home pay of $200K, he made about $17,000 per month, take home.  What the heck was he doing with the other money?  Wow.</p>
