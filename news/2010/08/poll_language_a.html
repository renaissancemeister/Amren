<h1>Poll: Language a Barrier for Latinos in Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen and Christine Armario, Google News, August 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With Hispanic enrollment surging in schools, many Spanish-speaking parents are having trouble helping their children with homework or communicating with U.S. teachers as English-immersion classes proliferate in K-12.</p>
<p>An Associated Press-Univision poll highlights the language and cultural obstacles for the nation&rsquo;s Latinos, who lag behind others when it comes to graduating from high school.</p>
<p>The findings also raise questions about whether English-immersion does more to assimilate or isolate  &mdash;  a heated debate that has divided states, academics and even the U.S. Supreme Court. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The nationwide poll, also sponsored by The Nielsen Company and Stanford University, found the vast majority of Hispanics  &mdash;  78 percent  &mdash;  had children enrolled in K-12 classes that were taught mostly in English, compared with 3 percent in Spanish.</p>
<p>Just 20 percent of mainly Spanish-speaking parents say they were able to communicate &#8220;extremely well&#8221; with their child&rsquo;s school, compared with 35 percent of Hispanics who speak English fluently.</p>
<p>About 42 percent of the Spanish speakers said it was easy for them to help with their children&rsquo;s schoolwork, compared with 59 percent of the Hispanics who speak English well.</p>
<p>Children of Spanish-dominant parents also were less likely to seek help with homework from their families. Fifty-seven percent of those parents said their children came to them with school questions. That&rsquo;s compared with 80 percent for mainly English-speaking Hispanic parents, who also were more likely to send their children to relatives or friends for answers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roughly 1 in 5 people in the U.S. speaks a language other than English at home, with Hispanics representing the largest share, according to 2009 census data. Hispanics also now make up one-fourth of the nation&rsquo;s kindergartners, part of a historic trend in which minorities are projected to become the new U.S. majority by midcentury.</p>
<p>Still, Hispanics are nearly three times as likely than the general U.S. population to drop out of high school, and half as likely to earn a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Education Department also wants to devote an additional $50 million next year to promote English learning. Part of that will be used for research and development of &#8220;dual-language immersion,&#8221; a bilingual approach gaining favor among many linguists.</p>
<p>Dual-immersion is a shift from the direction of states such as California, Arizona and Massachusetts, where voters have largely banned bilingual classes. On a broader level, some 30 states and numerous localities have passed laws making English the official language, a move that critics say will lead to more cuts in bilingual programs.</p>

		<p>I work in a 100% latino high school whose stated mission is to try and get the students to learn English while &#8216;respecting&rsquo; their native cultures.  In practical application, this means a heavy dose of &#8216;your cultures are great&rsquo; with extremely limited success in getting any English literacy going at all.  Some do learn conversational English, but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>We teachers (almost all of whom are white and from outside this major urban area) recognize that the kids speak spanish among themselves, with their families and on the street.  They listen to Spanish music all day long, watch spanish TV.  All the stores, restaurants, etc are spanish speaking and 95% of the people they see in the streets are either spanish speaking or black.  (The rest are asians of various types).</p>
<p>Privately, we lament to each other that English teaching doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance.  We do it privately, because the entire administration of our school, even up to the superintendent, are all latinos, promoted for racial reasons.  We whites (and a handful of blacks who have banded together with us in solidarity with a common language) are the peons.  Amazing isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Even if the school work was in Spanish entirely, the parents would STILL have problems helping their kids with homework.  The parents probably dropped out of school in 3rd grade, if they ever attended in the first place.  Moreover, the inability to speak English at home is a real good indicator of whether the parents are here legally, and most likely they are NOT.  Solution?  Check their status, and deny any public schooling for illegals and children of illegals.  Even with blacks in the schools remaining there, I predict a significant uptick in test scores and graduation rates if this was done.  And, quite a savings in property taxes.</p>

		<p>The only things which matter:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Hispanics also now make up one-fourth of the nation&rsquo;s kindergartners, part of a historic trend in which minorities are projected to become the new U.S. majority by midcentury.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>For this to happen, from a starting point of 35 million, Hispanics will need to continue to have a teen pregnancy rate rivaling if not exceeding those of blacks at around 65-68%.  Because they have to breed _twice_ for every 1-1.5 generational interval of a 105 million white population.  As well as self-import.</p>
<p>And if they can achieve this simple demographic majority, the &#8216;democratic&rsquo; question will rapidly become: &#8216;Why are we teaching English in a school dominated by Hispanic youth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The Education Department also wants to devote an additional $50 million next year to promote English learning. Part of that will be used for research and development of &ldquo;dual-language immersion,&rdquo; a bilingual approach gaining favor among many linguists.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I want to know what the implicit (cultural, instinctive, mimicked) vs. explicit (learned, conceptual, artistic, innovative) spread of IQ ratios are in societies which are mono vs. bilingual.</p>
<p>Where language is not somethng you can just &#8216;turn off&rsquo;, explicit reasoning tends to be a memory hog and the more terms you use to define a problem the larger a working memory you have to have.  </p>
<p>Since language is nothing but a giant glossary of terms and usage rules collection, I have a feeling that the more interpretative variations you have to master as &#8216;a meaning with two names&rsquo;, the -less- your function use of those terms is going to be in complex scenario or conditional (engineering, medical, etc.) based modeling.</p>
<p>Where white dominance of our culture has traditionally been about technologic preeminence, trying to become &#8216;more like the rest of society&rsquo; may have some economic and social relevancy (or relegative) consequences that are not foreseen for a culture-specific brain/IQ optimized system.</p>

		<p>I had trouble understanding some of this article. What are &ldquo;Children of Spanish-dominant parents&rdquo;? Is this a new euphemism for illegal alien? </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;as English-immersion classes proliferate in K-12.&rdquo; Does this mean US school systems are (finally) returning to their past and successful methods? </p>
<p>The solution is easy. Illegal aliens who come to the US should speak English fluently, and have a high school education (you know, like the vast majority of the US population). While they&rsquo;re at it, they might as well come legally, if they meet the requirements (after all, it is the law). BTW, white female citizens should have more kids and fewer abortions. <br>

		<p>I agree with 5-Istvan. I live in south Florida where the illegal immigration problem probably rivals Arizona&rsquo;s. Not long ago I was parked at a red light when a high school let out and, I swear, every single student was hispanic. No, this was not Miami. They complain our state is broke. I&rsquo;m not surprised - it seems like we&rsquo;re educating the entire third world! Where&rsquo;s it going to end! We desperately need immigration reform like they&rsquo;re trying to do in Arizona. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to get a job here unless you are bilingual (i.e.: speak spanish). To me, that seems a great injustice. They actually had the nerve in this state 15 to 20 years ago to put on a state voting ballot to make spanish the #1 language. Thankfully, it was voted down. Ah, last time I checked a map, wasn&rsquo;t Florida still part of the U.S.? </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been told there are two Korean language TV stations broadcasting in NYC. There must be even more in California.</p>
<p>From day one, birth to death, these people set up their own exclusive communities inside the US, celebrate themselves and their accomplishments and culture and &#8216;give back to the community&rsquo;, meanwhile the American media and American educators all act as if it is only whites who are do these &#8216;racist&rsquo; things (attitudes and behaviors that non-whites boldly celebrate) and that it&rsquo;s wrong and evil. There&rsquo;s a white-guilt mentality involved before they even get over here, for many immigrants, but once they get here, to the Mecca, they find America is even more anti-white/pro-people of color than the desperately proud colored nations they left behind - and are reproducing here. Perhaps what is needed is for whites to push back with equal force - it&rsquo;s only saving them from their own racism and ignorance. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that a bilingual society is any less successful than a monolingual one. As far as I know, language does not &#8220;hog&#8221; brain space as you suggest. History&rsquo;s greatest intellectuals were multilingual (Bohr, Einstein and Voltaire just to name a few). Being multilingual doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any negative effects on society as a whole as Belgium and Switzerland are wealthy, innovative nations.</p>

<p>And fifteen percent walk to work, as opposed to nineteen percent who carry their lunch.</p>
<p>Are the authors comparing apples and oranges here, or are they simply inept writers? Given that they also wrote &#8220;three times as likely than,&#8221; I&rsquo;m betting on the latter. What a useless article.</p>

		<p>I concur with those here who demand a STOP to all immigration now.</p>
<p>However, if we are going to reach out to refuegees, we Americans of European descent must rise up and shout for our European brothers and sisters who WILL BE persecuted in their own homelands by their muslim invaders. </p>
<p>No more Africans. No more Asians. No more mestizos. Obama and La Raza have gotten proactive about race. We must too.</p>

Switzerland being divided into cantons doesn&rsquo;t make it separate or unstable, and Belgium, having been on the verge of dissolution &#8220;for decades&#8221; is still functioning and is more likely to end up like Canada than partition completely.</p>

		<p>1. Sigh. Think of all the homework, laying unfinished, if only the racist teacher would write the assignments in Spanish!  Madre and Padre are just yearning to apply their extensive math and humanities knowledge to rocket young Latinas, etc. to Yale. If only it were in Spanish. Sigh.</p>
<p>2.  What makes anyone think the vast majority of African American parents speak English? Shouldn&rsquo;t homework be translated into Afro-speak so Shante and Devon can go to Dartmouth, which is their conzitushanal riyt to do so. It says that riyt hyah: Obama say everybody go to Kolej. for free. if you black.</p>
