			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Derek P. Jensen, Salt Lake Tribune, August 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Looking to maintain fairness in employment, particularly among Salt Lake City&rsquo;s immigrant and refugee communities, Mayor Ralph Becker has launched an anti-discrimination campaign on workplace rights.</p>
<p>For this summer&rsquo;s first phase, the city has scheduled training and information sessions to outline employment law on the city, state and federal levels. This fall, phase two will highlight the responsibilities and rights of employers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Salt Lake City is a progressive and diverse community where every individual is valued,&#8221; Becker said in a statement. &#8220;The anti-discrimination campaign demonstrates our determination to foster an environment of good will and a community that ensures a fair and safe workplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Francisco-Nez [Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Diversity and Human Rights] notes there are 25,000 refugees in the city and Salt Lake County. The goal is to reach 400 people over the course of three public workshops, the first of which is slated for Tuesday.</p>
<p>For the past 15 months, a committee has labored to develop a sensitive curriculum that considers the dynamics of the refugee and immigrant communities. Two known topics will focus on safety and minimum-wage requirements. Organizers expect the Spanish presentation scheduled for Oct. 5 at Centro Civico Mexicano to be the best attended.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The effort  &mdash;  an outgrowth of the city&rsquo;s anti-discrimination ordinance protecting gay and transgender residents from housing and employment bias  &mdash;  is a collaboration of the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Diversity and Human Rights, the Utah Workers Compensation Fund, the Utah Labor Commission and ACLU of Utah. Campaign partners include the Utah Latin American Chamber of Commerce, Salt Lake City Human Rights Commission, Society for Human Resources Management, Utah Office of Ethnic Affairs, United Way and the Utah Minority Bar Association.</p>

<p>Oh so now crime and mayhem is considered &#8220;dynamic&#8221;. This country is in SERIOUS trouble when they elect a wuss like this &#8216;Ralph Pecker - opps - Becker&rsquo; to run ANYTHING, especially Mayor. In a sane world he would&rsquo;ve been Mr. Wilson on the Dennis the Menace show - not Mayor! What&rsquo;s worse is that in order for him to get elected Mayor, most people in SLC would have to be just like him.   </p>

		<p>Mormon racial views are widely misunderstood: they really don&rsquo;t have any. Take it from an exmormon who grew up in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>-The Book of Mormon details the history of what Mormons believe are the ancestors of the &#8216;refugees&rsquo; mentioned in that article.  Therefore, they have a strong sentimental bond with all Amerinds.</p>
<p>-Central to Mormon theology is &#8216;agency&rsquo; aka free choice.  Choose to follow God or Satan.  This leads them to reject the idea of genetic predisposition to crime. It&rsquo;s a choice not a predilection!</p>
<p>-It&rsquo;s a mostly White city and, as we all know, it&rsquo;s not homogeneity that causes friction &amp; distrust, but being forced together. They just don&rsquo;t have a large enough base of personal experience to understand how wide spread undesirable behaviors are among certain groups.</p>
<p>-Mormons don&rsquo;t (usually) accept evolution and so tend to view minority degeneracy as a lack of &#8220;The Gospel of Jesus Christ&#8221; rather than genes that were adaptive in different environments.</p>
<p>-They actually have a reason to repent of racism: within living memory (1978) they actually believed that Blacks couldn&rsquo;t make it to the highest level of heaven and still believe that dark skin was the mark of Cain spoken of in Genesis. Thus, they have the converts zeal against even the appearance of racism. </p>
<p>-They&rsquo;re proud of their diversity: I heard a few bragging that their church now has more Spanish speaking members than English speaking members.</p>
<p>-In the Nature vs. Nurture debate Mormons are EXTREME nurture. They don&rsquo;t believe that homosexuality is biologically influenced. Guess how they think of crime, violence &amp; illegitimacy.   <br>

		<p>Well, by all means lets not keep this a secret. Lets let all illegals know that Salt Lake City looks favorable upon you and that this is the place you need to be. If you are illegal in Arizona and feel afraid, go to SLC. If things aren&rsquo;t so good in Las Vegas (my city) head on up to SLC because the mayor wants you.</p>

		<p>What?? I am confused.  How do worker rights over-rule legal residency???     US has too many laws that conflict with the basic national security enforcement.   Does this mean global workers have more rights than US citizens????  V</p>

<p>The LDS church is amongst those groups that are promoting the immigration of visible minorities.</p>

		<p>    It&rsquo;s so easy to be magnanimous when you are on top of the heap . Unfortunately Salt Lake City&rsquo;s time will come though . They will soon find out what so many major American cities have had to find out the hard way . And when they do it will be too late to turn back . The damage will be exponential . But I notice a certain left wing, secularist charity mentioned here, that can never seem to separate itself from political agenda, that is always wrongly allowed access to employees through the employer,who (the employees) are then compelled to participate out of guilt or fear of compromising their jobs, who never had to really account for the misappropriation of funds perpetrated by a CEO for thirty years and last I heard one of their more recent CEOs was just about as corruptible . Shouldn&rsquo;t charities stay out of politics and shouldn&rsquo;t they have to stand on their own two feet and not be allowed into a workers&rsquo; pay check through the backdoor (the employer) ?     </p>

		<p>  I always thought of the Mormons as an ultra-conservative sect. I assumed that Salt Lake City was one of the whitest large cities in the nation. I guess even the Mormons have drifted toward contemporary &#8220;liberation theology.&#8221;  It seems a shame, as their theological founders (Joseph Smith and Brigham Young) were very race conscious.</p>

		<p>Having lived in SLC for a little more than 6 years I have noticed that SLC is an island of red in a sea of dark blue. The former mayor Rocky Anderson organized a protest when president Bush came to town as a guest of the VFW. The LDS church is unfortunately a very naive organization and encourages immigration of its members. All too often for every faithful member there are about 6-7 hangers on that just want the goodies. Also Slc is getting browner by the day. Our neighborhood on the edge of town is more than half Hispanic with many of them somewhat unfriendly.</p>

		<p>As a resident of Salt Lake City, I have been seen the hypocrisy of Becker, alongside Police Chief Burbank.  Burbank has refused to report illegals to ICE and I fear Salt Lake will end up becoming just one more sanctuary city.  There are numerous refugee enclaves in the city and, as is obvious from their African garb and inability to drive (most are seen wandering the streets carrying a baby and groceries), I can safely assume they are NOT assimilating.  The original SLTrib article probably has its usual liberal comments but that is because it&rsquo;s Salt Lake City, a city unlike any other in Utah.</p>
