<h1><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/08/13/debate-grows-schools-closing-muslim-holidays/">Debate Grows as U.S. Schools Adjust Calendars to Observe Muslim Holidays</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diane Macedo, Fox News, August 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As an increasing number of U.S. public schools adjust their calendars to observe Muslim holidays, a debate is growing over how far schools should go to accommodate minority religious populations  &mdash;  and where they should stop.</p>
<p>Federal and state laws prohibit schools from penalizing students for missing school on religious holidays. In many school systems, these have long included Good Friday and the Jewish holidays of Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah and Passover.</p>
<p>In  many districts with sizable Catholic or Jewish populations, schools have traditionally closed on these holidays. But now the list of religious holidays increasingly includes Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha, which honors the Prophet Abraham. Some schools no longer administer tests on those holidays; others won&rsquo;t schedule school events, including sports activities, on the night before the holidays; and some districts are choosing to close their schools entirely.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But critics warn that schools may be heading down a slippery slope that will open the door for more extensive accommodation requests from the Muslim community, as well as demands from other minority religious communities looking for the same treatment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a bill currently before the [New York] state Senate that would declare the two Muslim holidays school holidays in the city, &#8220;Muslims constitute approximately 10 percent of the student body in the New York City School District.&#8221;</p>
<p>In neighboring New Jersey, Mike Yaple, spokesman for the state&rsquo;s School Boards Association, said most of the roughly nine districts in the Garden State that decided to close schools for Muslim holidays used the same rationale as Bloomberg.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;South Brunswick just recently decided they&rsquo;re going to close for two Islamic holidays and one Hindu holiday. The county in which South Brunswick is in has the highest concentration of Asians  &mdash;  19 percent  &mdash;  in the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Dearborn, Mich., where schools are closed on both the day before and the day of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, the predominantly-Muslim football team has switched its two-a-day summer practice schedule to 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. during Ramadan, so that Muslim players  &mdash;  who fast while the sun is up  &mdash;  won&rsquo;t be forced to practice in the heat without drinking water.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Maryland, Anne Arundel County recently decided to ban sporting events on the night before Muslim holidays, as well as tests administered on the holidays themselves  &mdash;  even though Muslim leaders estimate the Muslim population comprises less than 2 percent of the 521,000 residents of the county.</p>
<p>Rudwan Abu-Rumman, President of the Anne Arundel County Muslim Council, says Muslim students should not be forced to miss exams or school events in order to celebrate their holidays.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Peter Huessy a member of the Maryland Taxpayers Association Board of Directors, says the accommodations are still too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no problem with someone if they&rsquo;ve got a religious holiday and can&rsquo;t take a test, OK, take the test another time, but to inconvenience everyone else and say no tests and no sports is ridiculous,&#8221; Huessy told FoxNews.com. &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you&rsquo;re an Orthodox Jew and can&rsquo;t drive on the Sabbath, they don&rsquo;t cancel football. Either you walk to practice or your game, or you choose not to go. That&rsquo;s your choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest issue, Huessy says, it that each &#8220;crazy&#8221; request that&rsquo;s accommodated encourages more extensive requests in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;If communities cave once, they&rsquo;ll cave again and again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What&rsquo;s next? No school during the whole month of Ramadan?&#8221;</p>
<p>In Baltimore, which has refrained for years from scheduling tests on Muslim holidays, the city&rsquo;s Muslim leaders say they want more.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pharoan [Bash Pharoan, president of American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee&rsquo;s Baltimore Chapter] says he is fighting to ensure that schools don&rsquo;t administer tests on the day after the holidays, either, so Muslims won&rsquo;t have to worry about studying during their observance. And even though he estimates Muslims comprise only 3 to 5 percent of the student body, Pharoan says ultimately he wants to see the district close on those days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Burlington [Vermont] Superintendent Jeanne Collins said having the Muslim students miss school on their holiday negatively impacts student achievement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Muslim population is largely a refugee population of recent arrival refugees; that also adds to a complication of English not being their native language. So again missing school does have a significant impact on their learning,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But the change has already triggered requests from the area&rsquo;s small Hindu community to have one of its holidays off, she said, and she &#8220;absolutely&#8221; fears a domino effect of requests from other minority religions could be on the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this time, not having a Hindu population whose attendance is affected by absences, the board is not taking any action on that request,&#8221; Collins said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very important to stress again that the decision of the board is not stressing or recognizing any holiday for any religious reasons but that the actions of the board are focused on student achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Muslims in Hillsborough County, Fla., pushed for a day off to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the Hindu community there also started pushing for a day off to celebrate a Hindu holiday. The school board responded by dropping its days off for all religious holidays, but later reinstated days off for Good Friday, the Monday after Easter and Yom Kippur after thousands of e-mails protesting the move poured in from around the country, and the Muslim community leaders requested the days off be returned to the school calendar.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bradley Blakeman, a professor of public policy and politics at Georgetown University, says the best thing school districts can do is tailor their calendars and holiday accommodations to the wants and needs of their communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s the beauty of having a school district responsive to the localities as opposed to blanket rules that affect multiple jurisdictions, states or even countries&#8221; [says Blakeman]. &#8220;One size doesn&rsquo;t fit all when it comes to these kinds of rules and regulations. We&rsquo;re not a homogeneous nation, which makes us so great.&#8221;<br>

<p>When analyzing any piece of governmedia propaganda, one should always focus on the last paragraph, because that&rsquo;s the one the writer wants to leave in your memory.  The message you&rsquo;re supposed to take away from this one is that multiculti is just ever so wonderful.</p>
<p>Sorry, Media Masters, but discovering that <i>Vermont</i>, of all places, has a vocal moslem and hindu population   &mdash;   and that Whites are happily caving in to them   &mdash;   is the part that this Wicked Racist is going to remember.<br>

		<p>As someone who proudly put down my census form, that I am a practising member of the Jedi Knight religion.</p>
<p>I insist that, we celebrate that puppet Yoda&rsquo;s birthday and that it is also observed with a recognised public holiday.</p>

<p>This request is about as ridiculous as all these other multicultural rites.</p>
<p>The funny contradiction is that when we try to define ourselves as representing &#8216;everybody and everything&rsquo; in the world, we actually end up &#8216;representing nothing at all&rsquo;, leaving us with nothing to defend.<br>
&#8220;I would die for your right to believe in nothing&#8221;! Just sounds pointess to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into religion at all, but I still think our countries should have never gone secular; it has just created a vacuum.</p>

		<p>Too bad we don&rsquo;t have states&rsquo; rights anymore in any real sense.  This is tailor made for that prudent jurisdiction, as the founders&rsquo; intended.  A polyglot mongrel society is best ruled by decentralized state governments, rather than a tyrannical detached federal overlord.  That way, people can escape to another more desirable place, if they so decide.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not a homogeneous nation, which makes us so great&#8221;. - Those who adhere to this line of thought are expressing and perpetuating ignorance of human history.  While non-homogeneous nations can indeed last for some time, the end result of such experiements: Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Lebanon, Rome, etc., consistently proves to be a breakup, and in most cases with at least some blood being spilled.  In other words, the non-homogeneous nation is more or less a temporary nation, even though &#8220;temporary&#8221; can mean decades. Additionally, the &#8220;greatness&#8221; of a nation is debatable. In the case of the U.S., were we &#8220;great&#8221; due to our efforts in W.W.II?  How can that possibly be (any liberal please answer this one) if we were a nation of people, ~90% of whom were white, and where society was segregated?  To put it another way, were we great because of the accomplishments of a mostly homogeneous, segregated society, or were we evil? Otherwise, whenever Liberals push the &#8220;greatness&#8221; of modern day Multicultural America, they do so by living off the accomplishments, wealth, and/or ideas, of the -past- mostly homogeneous society of a majority White America. </p>

		<p>I cant blame the Hindus. They are only asking for a holiday as well because they observe white Americans grovelling in the dust before the ever aggressive moslems (much as the British whites do). Its like &#8220;Hey what about us? Why are you giving special favous to moslems and ignoring us!&#8221;. Obviously if moslems agitate and get what they want then other quiet communities should to! It seems to be a case of who shouts the loudest gets what they want. This is the law of the jungle&hellip;..the Left-wing multi-cultural jungle!!!</p>
<p>P.S its amazing that 9 years after 9/11 moslems instead of keeping their heads down are becoming more and more brazen!<br>

		<p>How about no holidays?  Christmas shouldn&rsquo;t even be a federal holiday in my opinion (it&rsquo;s pagan and not Christian for one thing) much less any other religious holidays.  I simply keep my child home if his school has a holiday party  &mdash;  not that there&rsquo;s any learning going on, right?</p>

		<p>Get your kid out of public school.  Support any legislation that offers parents the right to separate their tax contributions from the public educational system.  Support any legislation which offers the chance to test out for those who don&rsquo;t want to be in school after the 8th grade.</p>
<p>Find yourself a high density population of the kind of people you can stand to live and share your family with and instigate a home school or private system which is compatible with your ideas of what a child should LEARN from his/her formative years.</p>
<p>Back that up at home as much as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Public Education has turned into government sponsored day care with a touch of social engineering pablum thrown in to alienate your child from your understanding of life.</p>
<p>Fight its effects by removing him from that influence.  Success advances forwards and breeds.  Stupidity rots in place&hellip;and breeds.  Maybe the generation -after- dissolution will be wise enough to repeal the mistakes this one is making.  But only if they are a success in their own lives.</p>

		<p>Nothing can be expected from the government schools but more absurdities such as this as time goes by and the worthless minorities demand more and more and more concessions from silly, spineless, empty-suit administrators and school board members who are only too happy to grovel in their pursuit of diversity and multiculturalism.  The sooner intelligent, responsible whites leave such loony-bin school systems and establish their own schools, the better off they will be.</p>

		<p>As we know, most, if not all of the diversity pushers have their own kids in PRIVATE schools because they don&rsquo;t want their kids beaten, robbed or raped any more than we want it to happen to ours. Push it on us but not for them. OR! they have no children.</p>

<p>Well, I disagree with this. Christmas is a holiday that is an intricate part of our culture and has been for a very long time, and we shouldn&rsquo;t change our culture just because of immigrants. We also can&rsquo;t reasonably cater to every culture&rsquo;s holidays either. If people come to this country, they need to realize it and we need to stop catering to them. Better yet, halt immigration.</p>
