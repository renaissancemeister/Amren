<h1>Bing Nominates Convicted Murderer for Police Board</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George Hunter, Detroit News, July 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some police officers are furious that Mayor Dave Bing wants to nominate a convicted murderer to serve on a board that metes out discipline to cops and sets department policy.</p>
<p>Others argue Raphael B. Johnson, who served 12 years in prison for second-degree murder and is now a motivational speaker, is an inspiration and would be a good fit for the unpaid, four-member Board of Police Commissioners.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t ignore the substantial number of ex-offenders in Detroit who are trying to contribute in our community,&#8221; Deputy Mayor Saul Green said in a statement. &#8220;Raphael Johnson is an example of someone who has made the most of a second opportunity. He can play an important role in strengthening our connection to the community to better address public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some, including several officers who did not want to be quoted, fearing reprisal from the Mayor&rsquo;s Office, say the nomination plan sends a bad message.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson, 35, was convicted of second-degree murder in 1992. When he was 17, he got into a fight at a party, retrieved a handgun from a friend&rsquo;s car and fatally shot Johnny Havard, who was not involved in the fight. Johnson ran for City Council last year, advanced past the primary and lost in the general election.</p>
<p>He argued that nothing in the City Charter says board members must have clean criminal records.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson said he has paid for the crime. &#8220;What are the officers afraid of? I was 17 years old (when the crime was committed)  &mdash;  does that mean I&rsquo;m marked for life? I&rsquo;ve paid my dues; how long do you want me to suffer?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Retired Detroit Police Officer David Malhalab said Johnson should be allowed to get on with his life, but there are &#8220;more than enough (other) qualified people to fill that position.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He made a mistake and shouldn&rsquo;t be permanently scarred by it  &mdash;  but at the same time, there are certain things he shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to participate in because he committed a heinous crime,&#8221; Malhalab said. The position was left vacant when the term of former board Chairman Mohamed Okdie expired July 1.<br>

		<p>Talk about your Detroit 187.</p>
<p><i>Johnson said he has paid for the crime. &ldquo;What are the officers afraid of? I was 17 years old (when the crime was committed) &mdash; does that mean I&rsquo;m marked for life? I&rsquo;ve paid my dues; how long do you want me to suffer?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Yet, you marked another man for life when you were 17.  By the time you&rsquo;re 17, you should know that murder is wrong and have the requisite self-control not to commit murder.  BTW, the original article has the details of the 1992 murder, and it reads to me like it was 1st Degree Murder.  I suppose the DA didn&rsquo;t want to take a case that had the potential to be actual work, so they bargained it down to Murder 2 and a piddley 12 years in prison.</p>
<p>Maybe he is reformed and recalcitrant, but the fact that he didn&rsquo;t have the self-control as a young adult not to murder means that he should be disqualified from supervising men with guns, much less owning guns.</p>
<p>The original article also states that he makes a living as a &#8220;motivational speaker.&#8221;  Translated from community activist-ese into English, he goes around telling young black kids how not to commit crime.  Maybe it&rsquo;s jus&rsquo;me, but I would rather hear from people who have never committed a violent crime about how not to commit a violent crime.  Aside from the obvious reasons, maybe one big reason why so many black men commit violent crime is because they get all their advice about how not to be criminals from ex-criminals.</p>
<p>The original article says that Mr. Johnson states that if you don&rsquo;t want to deal with someone who has never been arrested, then one should move to Utah.  Utah should be so lucky.  BTW, fool, arrested and convicted are two different things.</p>
<p>Speaking of Michigan, I notice that Kwame Kilpatrick&rsquo;s mother got bounced out of her own Congressional seat in her own party&rsquo;s primary yesterday.  However, Mike Cox lost   &mdash;   The winner of Governor-Republican, Rick Snyder, former Gateway Computer CEO, is a big time outsourcer and H-1B user.  Which should go over so well in a rust belt state.  Michigan GOP voters just urinated on their own legs without the self-respect to call it rain.</p>

		<p>Blacks have a different morality from White Humanity.</p>
<p>Blacks think in terms of tribal survival and defeating the enemy.</p>
<p>Whites think the enemy is ourselves and we need constant improvement through wisdom, virtue, morality, and ethics.</p>
<p>Blacks are remarkably free from our ethical troubles, therefore, a criminal in their community isn&rsquo;t really a criminal. He&rsquo;s an inspiration.  Get it?</p>

		<p>Some people pay their dues and suffer a lifetime for things that happen out of their control. Some learn and have peace, others don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>This guy could have the same mentality at 35 as he did when he was 17. After 12 years of prison starting at age 17, technically he&rsquo;s only been out of high school for about 5 years. I&rsquo;d be cautious of even the most mature young man in a position like this at age 23 or 24.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the life one has lived in the time one&rsquo;s been given that&rsquo;s important. I don&rsquo;t know this guy&rsquo;s heart, but it&rsquo;s probably wise not to gamble on it when you have other qualified individuals who&rsquo;ve made it a point to stay out of bad situations. </p>

<p>I can HARDLY imagine a black taking an UNPAID position for anything and THIS! Chairman Mohamed Okdie tells me that the previous holder of this unpaid position is likely a muslim from Nigeria..is Johnson a prison converted muslim?</p>

		<p>As the new &#8220;stand-up&#8221; citizen, Brutha Johnson of DIEtroit says in the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve paid my dues; how long do you want me to suffer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get his victim&rsquo;s opinion:  </p>
<p>Oh wait, the guy is DEAD.  His victim is no longer living and thus he has no second chances. </p>
<p>Then there are the victim&rsquo;s family members who will suffer for life at their traumatic loss.  Johnson, the convicted murderer, should suffer as long as they do.  The quesion Mayor, aka &#8220;brutha&#8221; Bing, should ask is; Why is Johnson out after only 12 years in prison? </p>
<p>The lack of a conscience, gross emotional immaturity, and no impulse control are common traits among the majority of black people. Reptilian responses to social slights, real or imagined, is common among this race. And they regularly get elected to political office in black &#8220;communities&#8221;. </p>
<p>The tragic comedy that is DIEtroit continues.  <br>

		<p>What am I missing here? The mayor says that this murderer would be an asset to strengthen their connection to the commuinty. WHAT does that have to do with sitting on a board that metes out discipline and sets department policy? Those are two entirely different things in my opinion. What kind of insane world are we living in when a murderer decides if and how an officer of the law is disciplined? </p>
<p>And yes Mr. Johnson, you are marked for life. You should suffer til you die with remorse and regret, but as per usual with you people, it&rsquo;s all about me me me. It sickens me when the asslaint starts playing the victim, and whines about the &#8220;injustice&#8221; of the burden of having to carry the weight of their crime and being &#8220;marked&#8221;.</p>
<p>Did I do things at age 17 that I&rsquo;m not proud of? Yes I did. I cheated on my boyfriend, smoked cigarettes in the girls bathroom at school, and even drank when I could get it. But one thing is for sure, in all the fights I ever got into with another girl over a guy or whatever other silly thing, it NEVER crossed my mind to actully kill them. You see, MOST of us know WAY before then that killing is wrong. Mistakes are one thing. Murder is quite another.</p>

		<p>Johnson claims that he &#8220;paid his dues.&#8221;  In actuality, the taxpayers &#8220;paid the dues.&#8221; You know, the free medical care, free food, free library, free computer/internet, free counseling services, free job/skill/trade training etc., that many prisons give to felons.</p>
<p>What a huge slap in the face it must be to the victim&rsquo;s family to hear that the person who took their son&rsquo;s life is crying that he&rsquo;s marked for life and is being made to suffer.</p>

		<p>Johnson said he has paid for the crime. &ldquo;What are the officers afraid of? I was 17 years old (when the crime was committed) &mdash; does that mean I&rsquo;m marked for life? I&rsquo;ve paid my dues; how long do you want me to suffer?&rdquo;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Rhetorical questions obviously, but let me answer them anyway.</p>
<p>1)What are the officers afraid of? </p>
<p>The officers are afraid of an arrogant, unrepentant, black murderer being given an official government  license to ruin their lives and careers at a whim. They are afraid that murderers, gang members and social miscreants are hobnobbing with the ex NBA basketball player clown mayor and the foxes are guarding the chicken coop.</p>
<p>2)I was 17 years old (when the crime was committed) &mdash; does that mean I&rsquo;m marked for life?</p>
<p>You extinguished a human life. Someone&rsquo;s child, sibling, spouse or family member was removed from this Earth forever and you were out of prison before your thirtieth birthday. </p>
<p>YES. You are a dangerous unrepentant sociopath who feels you are the one who has suffered and have been inconvenienced by your extremely brief stay in a state facility where you no doubt enjoyed three hot meals and a roof over your head, cable tv, a gym and other amenities many working people cannot afford.</p>
<p>You clearly have a victim mentality and are not remorseful for your actions and thus you will probably harm others in the future. YES you should be marked for life as a dangerous predator for the safety of everyone around you and as a reminder of your heinous crime.</p>
<p><br>
3) I&rsquo;ve paid my dues&hellip;</p>
<p>How by hanging out with your gang member buddies in jail for an incomprehensibly short jail stint and then getting a well paid fake and completely useless and wasteful &#8220;motivational speaker&#8221; job where you go around to schools reminiscing about your gangster past and talking about all the b***hes and guns you once had until some crackpot black mayor decides you should be given a promotion and put in charge of ruining the careers of hapless white cops trying to bring order to the black urban areas of Detroit?</p>
<p>4)  how long do you want me to suffer?</p>
<p>IMO murderers should of course be executed as a matter of common sense and natural law. On the other hand if you let them live, make sure they are in long enough so that their youth is completely taken from them, they grow old and frail; keep them in so long that literally every single person on the outside that they ever knew has forgotten them or has died. Keep them in so long that when they get out the world they knew is gone and they are all alone and have no life to go back to. Even then it is really not enough as at least they get to live unlike their victims.</p>

<p>How does one &#8220;pay their dues&#8221; for this:</p>
<p>&#8220;When he was 17, he got into a fight at a party, retrieved a handgun from a friend&rsquo;s car and fatally shot Johnny Havard, who was not involved in the fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>A) He gets into a fight at a party (more likely an arguement),<br>
B) Has access to a friend&rsquo;s gun,<br>
C) Uses it to KILL someone at a PARTY when he was 17,<br>
D) Sufficient evidence of revolting behaviour to bar anyone for life from holding any position even remotely connected to law-enforcement or &#8216;the community&rsquo;.<br>
E) He thinks, &#8220;ohh like dude, that happened when I was a kid y&rsquo;know&#8221; and expects to be fully exonerated and &#8216;councel or advise&rsquo; real people in the community, including the police, after, let me re-iterate, &#8220;KILLING someone at a PARTY when he was 17.&#8221;<br>
Personally, I would not have this person any where near real people.</p>

<p>I wonder if the family of Johnny Havard feels Mr. Johnson has &#8220;paid his dues&#8221;.  There is no remorse in Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s statement.  Only that he has suffered so much and it&rsquo;s unfair to hold something, like MURDER, over his head.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson, until you can give back the life of the person you so carelessly killed, i think you have not paid your dues.</p>
