<h1><a href="https://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/01/sports/la-sp-baseball-notes-20100802">Ozzie Guillen Says Asian Players Treated Better Than Latinos</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, August 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chicago White Sox Manager Ozzie Guillen thinks Asian players are given privileges in the United States that Latinos are not afforded.</p>
<p>In his latest rant, the outspoken Guillen also said that he&rsquo;s the &#8220;only one&#8221; in baseball teaching young players from Latin America to stay away from performance-enhancing drugs and that Major League Baseball doesn&rsquo;t care about that.</p>
<p>He said MLB cares only about how often he argues with umpires and what he says to the media.</p>
<p>Guillen said it&rsquo;s unfair that Japanese players are assigned interpreters when they come to the U.S. to play pro ball, but Latinos are not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very bad. I say, why do we have Japanese interpreters and we don&rsquo;t have a Spanish one. I always say that. Why do they have that privilege and we don&rsquo;t?&#8221; Guillen said Sunday before Chicago played the Oakland Athletics. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t take this wrong, but they take advantage of us. We bring a Japanese player and they are very good and they bring all these privileges to them. We bring a Dominican kid &hellip; go to the minor leagues, good luck. Good luck. And it&rsquo;s always going to be like that. It&rsquo;s never going to change. But that&rsquo;s the way it is.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why do we need any foreign born baseball players anyway?  You mean to tell me their are no white kids, or black kids or Puerto Rican kids who can play baseball?  Come on now, this is absurd.  Paying foreigners hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year to hit a little ball?  Americans can not even do that anymore?</p>

		<p>Spanish speaking MLBers really don&rsquo;t need translators.  Spanish is so ubiquitous in the major leagues that it&rsquo;s almost the first language.  Most managers have to be at least conversational in it.  Many are actually fluent in Spanish.</p>

		<p>This is not the first time Guillen, this racist, has gone off the deep end.  Someone should point out that there are far more hispanic players in the majors that all other foreign born put together.  The commissioner should rebuke him, but won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>This guy&rsquo;s out of touch with reality. The reality is, with all the Mexican invaders living in Los Angeles, they don&rsquo;t <i>need</i> Spanish interpreters. Even the Korean immigrants skip English and go straight to Spanish lessons.</p>

<p>Try being white. We have to make it on our own talent without any special MLB paid camps and programs. The fact that baseball is still over 60% white is a tribute to our athleticism.</p>

		<p>This Ozzie can barely speak da&rsquo; English and when he does speak, it IS hard to understand him. He sometimes has his son with him to &#8220;translate&#8221; and &#8220;explain&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Of course it never would  occur to Ozzie that the linguistic leap between Spanish and English vs. the leap between Japanese and English would be tantamount to the difference between cats and wolves vs. butterflies and wolves.</p>

<p>College baseball is 95% white but the teams know that Dominicans will demand far less money and make far less demands than white (or even black) Americans.<br>

		<p>He has a point&hellip;.But thats not the issue. The rule should be for all players to learn ENGLISH! Speak your native language on your own time! Play baseball - learn english! Heck, our own government won&rsquo;t push that so I don&rsquo;t expect MLB to make a rule that makes complete sense!</p>

		<p>This guy is complaining about &#8220;latino&#8221; players being discriminated against in baseball? Excuse me, but how many millions are the players getting now? In case your wondering, it&rsquo;s 3.3 million. And the highest paid player is the Alex Rodriguez at 33 million. I wonder if he feels discriminated against? Quick! Someone get A-Rod an interpreter! LOL!</p>

		<p>The reason is not racism, reverse racism or any other nonsense.  It&rsquo;s a simple matter of economics.  Almost all of the Japanese players that have come to America are proven players in their mid to late twenties.  MLB teams pay large sums of money to buy these players from their Japanese teams.  Hence the amount of attention placed on their large investments will be significantly higher than that placed on a 19-year-old unproven minor league player whose investment is much lower and risk profile (on average) much higher.</p>
<p>Ichiro is a ten year player w/ a 330+ career BA.  He is overrated, but still an elite player.  He also was a 5-time batting champ in the Japanese Leagues before he came here.  A proven player from Japan costs big bucks. Any team owner with a half a brain is going to make sure the transition is smooth as possible for a player like this, much more so than a 18-year-old 7th round pick from the Dominican Republic or Iowa for that matter.  Moreover, Japanese players open new lucrative media markets for MLB.</p>

		<p>Ozzie is just another reason to never waste time or money watching overpaid punk athletes, not to mention how ignorant they are, we all have better things to do.</p>
<p>Our world would be a better place without pro sports.  Athletes so dumb they couldn&rsquo;t spell cat if you spotted them the c and a.<br>

		<p>Here is why Asian players are given better treatment, </p>
<p>1) they&rsquo;re usually veteran players; and <br>
2) they have other lucrative baseball opportunities than playing MLB.</p>
<p>The Asian leagues have minimum service requirements before a player can leave their system.  Almost every Asian player in MLB came here after establishing pro career in their home country, making it more likely they will be successful MLB players.  In addition, Asian leagues pay competitive salaries, given a viable option for Asians to stay and play pro ball at home.  By comparison the Hispanic leagues pay their players almost nothing which leaves them no alternative but to sign a MLB contract.  </p>

		<p>It is funny to see a guy who undoubtedly played the difference card whine about being upstaged by someone more culturally interesting than he is. Baseball has made the transition from a game for white Americans youngsters by white Americans youngsters to an international entertainment venue. It is just modern gigantism, it is boring, and I wish it would go away. In the meantime enjoy the lovely personalities spawned by the cult of celebrity.</p>
