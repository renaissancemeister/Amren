			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colleen O&rsquo;Connor, Denver Post, August 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If the world is fast becoming a global village, South High School is a microcosm of that cultural shift.</p>
<p>The first day of school for ninth-graders was like a visit to the United Nations, with kids from 40 different countries speaking more than 60 different languages in the hallways.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people talk about diversity, but we really embrace it,&#8221; said Stephen Wera, principal of the school, which sits at the south end of Washington Park in Denver. &#8220;We are the newcomer high school for the district. If you come here from Nepal or Sudan, and you live in the city or county of Denver, you come to South.&#8221;</p>
<p>The main hallway is decorated with the flags of all the countries that the kids come from. An intersecting hallway boasts the flags of the colleges attended by last year&rsquo;s graduates, including Colorado School of Mines, the University of Northern Colorado and New York University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, 33 percent of the students at South were English-language learners, compared with 31 percent districtwide. After English and Spanish, the languages most widely spoken at South are Arabic, Nepali, Karen, Somali, French, Russian and Burmese.</p>
<p>Some teens might never have been to school before setting foot on this campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you come from Nepal, or from one of the refugee camps in Africa, you might not have gone to a formal school,&#8221; Wera said. {snip}</p>
<p>South graduated 252 students in 2009, or 67.4 percent, compared with 52.7 percent for the district. Its dropout rate that year was 5 percent, or about 120 pupils, compared with 7.4 percent for the district.</p>
<p>Credit, Wera said, is due to South&rsquo;s teachers and support staff, which includes people who speak such languages as Burmese, Arabic, Korean and Nepali.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a parade of nations, and everyone shows off their country, culture and background,&#8221; said Wera. &#8220;Here, diversity is not lip service.&#8221;<br/>

		<p><i>&ldquo;A lot of people talk about diversity, but we really embrace it,&rdquo; said Stephen Wera, principal of the school, which sits at the south end of Washington Park in Denver. &ldquo;We are the newcomer high school for the district. If you come here from Nepal or Sudan, and you live in the city or county of Denver, you come to South.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet Mr. Wera is so giddy with excitement over the diversity at his school, that he lies awake at night basking in his own moral superiorty.</p>
<p>What Mr. Wera isn&rsquo;t aware of yet or refuses to acknowledge is that this school is going to be a failure just like our International School is in Buffalo:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/38nob5s</p>
<p>Some Quotes from the article:</p>
<p><i>Because of the particular challenges facing International School, Superintendent James A. Williams appealed to the state to release it from the list of persistently lowest-achieving schools. The state would not budge.</i></p>
<p><i>The school was cited for its performance in English. Last year, about one-third of its students were considered proficient. This year, after the state raised the bar on its tests, the school&rsquo;s results suffered, but not as much as most other schools in the city.</i></p>
<p><i>Its extensive diversity is not the only thing that sets International School apart from the rest of Buffalo&rsquo;s persistently lowest-achieving schools.</i></p>

<p>Well, when an article that begins with such a sanctimoniously anti-white diatribe, you know it is not going to get much better as you read forward. Here, that almost universal dictum of diversity drivel in print, certainly plays out in both black and white.</p>
<p>We are not a global village on this planet, end of discussion!</p>
<p>We are a collection of competing and often warring: races, religions, ideologies, and countries. We never benefit from a &ldquo;cultural shift,&rdquo; unless it is within a nearly or outright homogeneous groping, that welcomes that shift; these shifts can be: political, socioeconomic, technological, and so on, but they are never successful unless agreed upon by the vast majority of the people that will be impacted by the cultural shift in question. </p>
<p>The concept of a &ldquo;global village&rdquo; is the best illustration of such an imperiously imposed  &ldquo;cultural shift,&rdquo; failing disastrously. No one, but the elites in Western countries honestly believes in it; it is a joke and a fantasy of the rich and powerful in the West, to manipulate and dominate the rest of the world, within a comforting cloak of self-righteous and morbid hypocrisy.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>&#8220;South High in Denver Embraces Diversity. </p>
<p>&#8220;Students from 40 countries, speaking 60 languages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait until they go through a crisis or two where they&rsquo;re at odds with each other, because they feel as if their group isn&rsquo;t getting what they want.</p>
<p>As the radical liberal professor who made the study revealing that people in diverse neighborhoods don&rsquo;t help each other and they view everybody with suspicion, this insanity they&rsquo;re bragging about now is destined to come down to the norm, which is a lot of ugly fighting.</p>
<p>How many are out of work yet?  How many have been denied social benefits yet?  How many feel as if their culture, religion or holidays are ignored?</p>
<p>All these matters are important, because we are rapidly losing the boom time prosperity that has a tendency to smooth matters over.  It is being replaced by foreclosures, lower pay, few jobs, and a dollar that is losing value very quickly.</p>
<p>Homogeneous societies can withstand hard times, but diverse societies are recipes for chaos and mayhem, during times of stress and want.  In fact history tells us that many of them break up into warfare.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Denver is headed.</p>

		<p>Posters 1 and 4 hit the nail on the head!</p>
<p>White liberals love the exotic nature of the immigrants.  These are the same whites who have buddha statues in their home and exotic wall hangings.  </p>
<p>These whites bask in their &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; without even realizing it, being the white beacon on a hill, the gatekeeper to the docile brown people who must reverentially approach them for the keys to English and the mysteries of the modern world.</p>
<p>But then the kids of the docile exotics mostly become gangbangers.  There&rsquo;s &#8216;ethnics&rsquo; all around me where I live, and I do not feel confident that most of them would sacrifice for the sake of this country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;kids from 40 different countries speaking more than 60 different languages.&#8221;  How on earth is it possible for the teachers to conduct classes in English, as I am certain they don&rsquo;t have interpreters for all 60 languages?  Wera sure is a black/brown smooching, in love with diversity, stalwartly defending affirmative action knave who should be MSM&rsquo;s hero of the decade!  Yet you can be certain that in the rare event he may drive through a NW neighborhood, he locks his car doors at intersections when blacks/browns cross the street.  And he lives in a lilly-white neighborhood himself. But he will have to hire cafeteria staff that can cook all the different foods that the diverse student body will most certainly demand.  And have the intercom system playing &#8220;We Are The World&#8221; all the day long! </p>

		<p>I despise the idea of living in a &#8220;global village.&#8221; This silly article reminds me of a book I had as a kid entitled &#8220;People.&#8221; The first twenty or so pages show all the interesting, diverse, people of the world using, to be honest, some very obvious stereotypes. However, towards the end of the book, it shows a bunch of white Americans staring angrily at a digustingly pish-podge group of Somalis, Arabs, Hmong, Bantu tribesmen, and even an Orthodox priest. And of course, all the poor minorities are frowning and look very, very sad. And the book actually says, on that page; &#8220;It is very strange: Some people even hate others because they are different. They forget that they too would seem different if they could only see themselves through other people&rsquo;s eyes.&#8221; The idiot who wrote the book doesn&rsquo;t realize that our world&rsquo;s wonderful, interesting, enlightening diversity is only good when each group keeps to its own, and that it CANNOT survive in a globalist, liberal, accepting world where diversity is judged on a national, or even municipal, level, rather than on a world-wide level, as it should be.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for the French and Russian students mentioned in the article, I can&rsquo;t imagine going to such a diverse school.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We are the newcomer high school for the district. If you come here from Nepal or Sudan, and you live in the city or county of Denver, you come to South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have a game the principal can play. Distribute a questionnaire to all students who were born in wonderful lands of gentility like Sudan and Nepal, or whose parents were born there too. (Mexican and Latino students can play too, as well as the funloving Burmese.) </p>
<p>The Question is: &#8220;In 2015, you are in the US Army or Marines. America goes to war against your &#8220;native&#8221; land. You are ordered to bomb,eliminate, exterminate (take your pick) a village from which US troops have come under fire.  Members of your family and most respected elders and clergy are in the village and some are trying to kill you and your mostly white platoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Choose one answer:</p>
<p>a. follow orders<br/>
b. disobey orders and join the insurgents, your kin.<br/>
c. pretend you are sick and have to go home.Like you do in school when there is a test with BIG English words.&#8221;  </p>

1.Item. Refugee airfare Congo to Denver. $1950<br/>
2. Item. Refugee Somali foot baths. Materials and install. $6500<br/>
3. Item. Refugee medical treatment Dengue Fever. $17,500.<br/>
4. Item. Refugee HIV treatment. $26,540<br/>
5. Item. Emergency room treatment. Gunshot. $32,000</p>

		<p>&#8220;If the world is fast becoming a global village, South High School is a microcosm of that cultural shift.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;world&#8221; is not fast becoming a global village.  Only the degenerative West is becoming a global village.  It is the white, self-appointed elites who are so dimwitted they&rsquo;ve been brainwashed into believing multiculturalism is good for their pocketbooks and their desire for more power.</p>
<p>This process of collapse the West is experiencing now is expected to put the finishing touches on the last of their empires and domination.  The fools who are unable to contain their glee at the deteriorating conditions are too dimwitted to understand that the concept of power grabbing, nationalism and the like will only shift to whatever power becomes most dominant, like China.  </p>
<p>And Japan will always be tagging just behind the leaders as it does now.  Both are most apt to weather any chaos and tumultuous events that might occur shortly, because they are a more united people with far few differences in ethnicity and race.  They&rsquo;re not about to open their borders to every third world horde that is seeking to be cared for.  They can see the weakness and degeneration &#8220;diversity&#8221; has caused the white fools in the West.</p>
<p>So, the near future reveals that it will be nationalism and, to a substantial degree, racism that will continue to be most dominant as it was in the West in years past.  And, like everything else the propogandists try to manipulate, things will only get worse for them.  The very same factors they hated about the West will be present to the nth degree in the dominate society of the future.  And, they could very well find themselves subject to round up and extinction simply because they are recognized as not being compatible to the existing power houses. </p>

		<p>To answer the question posed by #8, having firsthand teaching in such &#8216;rainbow&rsquo; schools, I can tell you that 50% of the teachers just rattle off in English and the kids look bored and bewildered.  Then the flustered teacher gives them some silly project that is not much above the level of coloring exercises.</p>
<p>The other 50% of the teachers talk slowly and pair the kids up and use the smarter ones to try and pantomime the instructions to the clueless one.  Mind you even the smarter ones can barely understand a word of English, so - you guessed it!  Out comes the colorful &#8216;group project&rsquo; where everyone does busy work and makes these awesome poster boards full of color, glitter and big pictures taken off the internet - oh, along with lots of flags representing the &#8216;home&rsquo; countries of each participant - ad nauseam!</p>

		<p>These posts are really insightful and stylish, a routine occurrence on Amren.<br/>
I thought I would add a point, and that is the irony of the pitiful situation at this school. The USA is sinking into a morass of debt, disillusion and official silence about our prospects. Those prospects are, of course, bad. It is beyond annoying to see publicly funded institutions still indulging in manic delusions about their impending greatness when all evidence disputes it.<br/>
The clear implication of the East Asian juggernaut is that ethnic cohesion and linguistic unity is necessary for a society to compete in the 21st century. Ethnic tension detracts from both, and it is clear that &#8220;diversity&#8221; sets up a society for conflict. <br/>
The USA is destined to be a nation of enclaves.</p>

Exactly, exactly. This perfectly describes what happens in <br/>
these socially engineered &#8220;multicultural&#8221; classrooms. Contentless &#8220;feel good&#8221; excercises in nothingness. The entire multi billion dollar education system devoted to keeping everyone at the mental age of 9 years old.<br/>
The smart kids ache with boredom and wish for better..but<br/>
dont know what &#8220;better&#8221; could be, the dull kids go along<br/>
happy that so little is required, and the sociopathic<br/>
kids learn raging contempt for a system based on such idiocy.</p>
