			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sherry Jacobson, Dallas Morning News, August 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As Republican members of Congress press for changes to the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, preventing automatic citizenship for babies born to illegal immigrants, opponents insist the debate is not really about babies.</p>
<p>Instead, they say it is about politics and votes  &mdash;  not fixing the immigration system.</p>
<p>Still, the debate could resonate in Texas, where not only 1.5 million illegal immigrants are estimated to reside but at least 60,000 babies are added to their households annually.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But to Republicans, the emerging national debate is long overdue, considering that millions of immigrants have been living illegally in this country for years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve checked the Congressional Record for when the 14th Amendment was written, and the author was quoted as saying that it did not apply to foreigners,&#8221; he [Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler] said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no question in my mind about it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Amendment&rsquo;s history</b></p>
<p>The 14th Amendment was adopted in 1868 as a way to block state laws that prevented former slaves from becoming citizens. It also effectively overruled the Dred Scott decision of 1857 in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared that slaves were mere property and could not become citizens.</p>
<p>The amendment offered a broad definition of citizenship in one simple sentence: &#8220;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald Kerwin, a vice president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., said he feared that altering the current interpretation of that law &#8220;would essentially restore the Dred Scott reasoning and create a hereditary underclass in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The effort to reinterpret the 14th Amendment has been talked about for years and been targeted by numerous congressional measures that went nowhere. Last year&rsquo;s unsuccessful Birthright Citizenship Act, which had about 100 co-sponsors in Congress, would have required at least one parent to be a U.S. citizen for a baby to become an American citizen at birth.</p>
<p>The difference in this year&rsquo;s effort to change the 14th Amendment is that prominent Republicans are offering their support and making public statements demanding a national debate of the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Changing the Constitution, however, is not as simple as getting a bill through Congress by majority vote.</p>
<p>Amendments have to be approved by a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, then ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures. It has happened only 27 times in U.S. history, most recently in 1992 in reference to congressional pay increases.</p>
<p>This latest effort would fall far short of tackling the entire Latino population now living illegally in the U.S.  &mdash;  the 11 million to 12 million people, according to estimates by the Pew Hispanic Center  &mdash;  because it would target only the children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>16 percent of births</b></p>
<p>In Texas, between 60,000 to 65,000 babies achieve U.S. citizenship annually by being born in the state&rsquo;s hospitals, according to a tally released by the state&rsquo;s Health and Human Services Commission. Last year, such births represented almost 16 percent of the total births statewide.</p>
<p>Between 2001 and 2009, births to illegal immigrant women totaled 542,152 in Texas alone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, Dr. Steve Murdock, a past director of the U.S. Census Bureau, said it would be difficult  &mdash;  even impossible  &mdash;  to turn this demographic tide by targeting the legal status of future births.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Murdock, previously the state&rsquo;s chief demographer and now a professor at Rice University, said the growth of Hispanics as a group in Texas has more to do with their relatively younger ages than the Anglo majority and their higher birthrates.</p>

		<p>So such an amendment would &#8220;restore Dred Scott reasoning&#8221; according to a VP of the Migration Policy Institute.  This bugaboo statement could mean any number of things, as it was most likely intended to do.  I figured it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before someone started howling that any change regarding the 14th Amendment would take away blacks&rsquo; voting rights or even somehow reinstitute slavery!  <br>
Unless Republicans actually introduce and get this proposal going in Congress, I won&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s anything but rhetoric.  It would take so long to be implemented, as it is, that it will work handily as a stall tactic.  One thing such an introduction would do, nonetheless, is send one more message to the illegals that they are not wanted.  </p>

<p><b>WASHINGTON  &mdash;  Rather than shout, I&rsquo;ll just ask the question in a civil way: Dear Republicans, do you really want to endanger your party&rsquo;s greatest political legacy by turning the 14th Amendment to our Constitution into an excuse for election-year ugliness?</b></p>

		<p>This clearly shows that this administration, as well as several previous ones, place no value whatsoever on American citizenship. Might as well stand on the border and hand it out as illegals step across. Our government has belittled everything that our forefather dreamed and planned for this country, and until we elect people whose allegiance is to the US instead of foreign interests, we&rsquo;re lost.</p>

		<p>MODIFY THE 14th AMENDMENT???</p>
<p>BAH!!!</p>
<p>REPEAL IT!!!</p>
<p>For a quick glimpse at how this amendment was un-Constitutionally adopted see the link on readers&rsquo; comments Post #17, American Renaissance article &#8220;White Citizenship,&#8221; August 6.</p>
<p>While the Supreme Court upheld it in 1919 (Leezer v. Garett), the amendment could be rescinded if 3/4ths of the states&rsquo; legislatures voted to have it done.</p>
<p>Most &#8220;civil rights&#8221; legislation uses this amendment as its basis.  Eliminate the cornerstone and the whole shabby structure will implode! </p>

		<p>I deal with, and have dealt with, hundreds of illegals and their misbegotten &#8220;citizen&#8221; broods, and I can say for a fact that the mother&rsquo;s pocketbook is ALWAYS chock-full of ALL the benefit cards for welfare, medical, and food assistance based on their anchor babies&rsquo; ERRONEOUS status as &#8220;citizens.&#8221;  Not only that, but I often find they are double-dealing, and drawing from TWO states&rsquo; welfare systems, until such time as one state revokes their draw.  Any mamby-pamby liberal who says &#8220;Illegals are not eligible for any benefits&#8221; should explain how having all your childrens&rsquo; costs covered &#8220;on the house&#8221; is not a HUGE benefit the illegal parents are drawing on!</p>

		<p>Unlike many aspects of the Constitution..we have a DIRECT STATEMENT by those who wrote it regarding its interpretation<br>
It does NOT apply to those illegally on US soil.<br>
Therefor Birthright Citizenship is NOT the law. And never was.<br>
Anchor Babies are NOT citizens..and never were.<br>
Those who interpreted otherwise never had a shred of legal<br>
support behind their guesswork.<br>
 Do not cross Go.<br>
Do not collect $200 dollars. <br>
Game Over<br>

<p>Only racists would want to change the 14th Amendment.  Whites just are clinging to the past and not accepting the browning of America through the blessings that anchor babies bring Democracy.</p>
<p>This debate will wither and die, just like all the others where White people start standing up to protect the country from being overrun with &#8220;global citizens&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The 14th was misinterpreted in the first place DELIBERATELY by the enemies of the White race. We never needed or wanted that amendment to begin with. The black slaves should have all been sent back to their &#8220;roots&#8221;. As the Founders made clear, this nation was formed and built for WHITE people only. THEIR PROGENY!</p>
<p>Black slaves should never have been given citizenship nor their children, let alone illegals! It was all by design to destroy WHITE America. </p>

<p>Priority #1: Finish the Fence. </p>
<p>Priority #1: Deal with the 14th Amendment/Anchor Baby problem, like yesterday.</p>
<p>Priority #1: Repatriate the 10,000,000-plus freeloading invaders who are breaking our Amrerican laws by simply being here. </p>

		<p>Amending the Constitution would never get done and the illegals would continue to pour into our country. Instead, make it a felony punishable for up to five years in prison for an illegal to birth a child within our borders. The child, and other children if any, would go into (I hate to say this) state ran institution Or they can take their child and go back to where they came, renouncing that child&rsquo;s citizenship.</p>

		<p>Obviously, lessers who lack the intelligence to truly understand the greater mechanisms of our Great Nation think this whole business of citizenship is just a game. </p>

		<p>A number of nations have come to their senses in the past 30 years and repealed birthright citizenship. Among them are the UK, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and France. The USA and Canada are the only developed countries in the world that still practice it. Also, many other countries have relaxed laws forbidding multiple citizenships. Combine this with the American government&rsquo;s tacit approval of illegal immigration and it&rsquo;s only natural that people with the means and desire to do so will give birth to children in the US merely to have them obtain citizenship.   </p>
