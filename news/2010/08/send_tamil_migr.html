			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Lilley, Ottawa Sun, August 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Send them home and use the Navy if necessary is the message coming from a new poll on the Tamil boat people issue.</p>
<p>By a margin of five to one, Canadians say the government should reject the almost 500 would-be refugees from Sri Lanka who arrived last week.</p>
<p>The Leger Marketing poll of 1,500 people, released exclusively to QMI Agency, was conducted from Aug. 2 to Aug. 4 as the ship travelled towards the British Columbia coast.</p>
<p>Asked which statement best described their own opinion on what should be done with the ship, which may include members of the banned Tamil Tiger terrorist group, 60% agreed with the statement: &#8220;They should be turned away  &mdash;  the boat should be escorted back to Sri Lanka by the Canadian Navy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just 17% agreed with the statement: &#8220;They should be accepted into Canada as political refugees.&#8221;</p>
<p>A significant number, 20%, said they did not know which answer to choose and 4% did not answer.</p>
<p>Alberta ranked highest with 74% of respondents there saying send the boat back and just 11% saying let them stay, while Quebec was the second highest with 64% opting to send the boat back and 15% saying the passengers should stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a very high number,&#8221; said Leger pollster David Scholz.</p>
<p>Scholz said the number is likely high for a number of factors, including concerns about who arrived on the boat, such as possible terrorists, and whether other boats will follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is that worry that this is potentially people coming in, not just jumping the queue, but coming in and falsely representing where they are from,&#8221; said Scholz. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t often hear about other refugee claims that are done on an individual or family basis, but when we see lots of them at the same time we tend to get a little nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin Collacott was Canada&rsquo;s highest-ranking diplomat in Sri Lanka during the period when the civil war launched by the Tamil Tigers started in the early 1980s. Collacott says we can&rsquo;t just turn the boat back.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to follow the process that takes the ones that are legitimate refugees and return the others,&#8221; said Collacott.</p>
<p>How many are legitimate refugees is up for debate said Collacott, who noted that the ship, the MV Sun Sea, didn&rsquo;t come directly from Sri Lanka, but from Thailand where the passengers were safe from any possible persecution from the Sri Lankan government.</p>
<p>As for what he takes away from the fact that the majority of Canadians don&rsquo;t want the government to let the would-be refugees stay, Collacott pins the blame on a battered immigration system.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it shows Canadians feel they are being taken advantage of,&#8221; said Collacott.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tamil Congress believes the poll results are a reflection of feelings towards the immigration system, not Tamils themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is a growing frustration,&#8221; said spokesperson Manjula Selvarajah.</p>
<p>Still Selvarajah puts some of the blame on government rhetoric that has warned about possible criminal or terrorist connections on the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;People may be reacting to certain words such as queue jumpers and human smugglers,&#8221; said Selvarajah. &#8220;If people understood the immigration and refugee system and the process in place, they may have a bit more faith in the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pollster Scholz told QMI Agency the results cannot conclude whether race or ethnicity are factors in the reaction Canadians are having to the boat&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,500 adult Canadians was taken online between Aug. 2 and Aug. 4. A probability sample of the same size would yield a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.</p>

So when do they come up with the reason that their was a civil war was the fault of white people. It may have worked with the Hmong because they fought on our side in the Vietnam war. Maybe if white countries will no longer accept refugees it may go far in reducing the number of civil wars in the world. In other words if you start a civil war then you must suffer the consequences if you lose.</p>

This poll will only prove to those in charge that &#8216;racism&rsquo; still permeates all aspects of Canadian society and therefore they will need to re-double their efforts to make Canadians more tolerate by bringing in more refugees.</p>
<p>The answer to every multicultural problem is more diversity.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s another opinion poll in Canada that is attracting attention. In the mayor&rsquo;s race for Toronto, the leading candidate, Rob Ford, says immigration to Toronto should be stopped. He says we should look after our own people and fix up the city before we bring in any more. If you know anything about Toronto you&rsquo;ll know how controversial this is. Those of you from Toronto should tell as many of your friends as you can that you&rsquo;ll be voting for Ford. We&rsquo;ve got to get this guy elected.</p>

		<p> The public is against giving these law-breakers asylum, but the Canadian ruling classes are for it. I really can&rsquo;t say that either the United States or Canada are democracies in the truest sense. Both are plutocratic oligarchies. Our privileged elites are more concerned about utopian ideas of race and ethnicity than public opinion. </p>

Actually, our privileged elites want more customers to drive up prices, and more job applicants to drive down wages.   <br>

		<p>This has nothing to do with Racism, why is it every time a white person disagrees with something that involves non whites it racism?<br>
This has to do with the Canadian government letting to many people into this country while the country is broke, and then they just let these people lose. There&rsquo;s thousands of refugees that come to Canada the legal way and most Canadians have no problem with them. It&rsquo;s the ones that pay criminals thousands of dollars to jump the line. </p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m sure in Canada, it&rsquo;s the same as it is in the [for now] U.S.: what the people want doesn&rsquo;t mean squat to the government.</p>
