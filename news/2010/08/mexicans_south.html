<h1>Mexicans, South Americans, Latin Americans, Turks and Cubans: All Coming to Europe via the EU</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP News, August 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is well known that America is currently being crushed by a tidal wave of Mexican &#8220;immigrants&#8221; but less well known is the fact that Mexicans, Cubans and Latin and South Americans are also pouring into Europe, courtesy of the European Union.</p>
<p>The absurd situation has come about because of a decision by the Spanish government to grant citizenship to any person who has a far-off distant relation who might have left that country up to 80 years ago at the time of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>According to official figures released by the Spanish government, there have been 161,463 applications for Spanish citizenship under the new law since it came into force in January this year.</p>
<p>Some 95 percent of these applications are from Latin American countries. Another 82,000 Cubans have applied for Spanish passports and it is estimated that at least 150,000 Mexicans are eligible.</p>
<p>Of this number, more than 14,000 have already been given Spanish citizenship and reports claim that there are &#8220;huge queues&#8221; of passport-seekers forming every day outside the Spanish embassy in Mexico City.</p>
<p>These figures do not, of course, include spouses, children or parents, all of whom will qualify for residence as dependents of EU nationals.</p>
<p>It is well known that Britain is the number one target for immigrants entering the EU because of the lavish benefits on offer in this country and the insane straitjacket of political correctness which prevents scroungers from being deported.</p>
<p>It is not only Spain which has opened the door to even larger numbers of non-EU nationals to enter Europe.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian and Romanian governments have also enacted laws granting passports to people who are considered to have distant connections with those countries.</p>
<p>According to new laws in Bulgaria and Romania, people who have the most tenuous links to those nations and who now live in Moldova, Serbia, Macedonia, Turkey and the Ukraine also qualify for EU-valid passports.</p>
<p>Reports claimed that some 4.7 million people are estimated to be eligible for EU citizenship in this manner.</p>
<p>All of these people are completely unaffected by the nonsense Tory &#8220;immigration cap&#8221; which only applies to non-EU nationals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was the Tory government under John Major which signed Britain up to the &#8220;free movement of EU nationals&#8221; directive in the first place.<br>

		<p>As economist Milton Friedman said, &#8220;You cannot simultaneously have free immigration and a welfare state.&#8221;  But far too many lefties are determined to prove that they can put the entire world on welfare.  They don&rsquo;t mind if they bankrupt their own countries trying.</p>

		<p>The Brits have no where to run. Sixty million plus people living in a area the size of Oregon, with more English-hating, third-worlders pouring in every day. All western nations are on their way out, and history will record the primary reason for the fall of the West as being the high levels of non-assimilable immigration.  Specifically for England, the next time the Falklands come up as an issue and the Agentines take over by default, we&rsquo;ll know England has died. And with that, we&rsquo;ll know the West (White, Northern European society) is on its death bed.</p>

		<p>I wonder why they&rsquo;re making a fuss about this.  These immigrants would have to be European Spaniards.  Spanish-born emigrants (mainly exiles from the Spanish Civil War and economic migrants) and their children are eligible to recover their Spanish nationality without the requirement of residence in Spain. Regardless of their place of birth, the adult children and grandchildren of original Spaniards (original Spaniards are those who, at the moment of their birth, were born to people who possessed Spanish citizenship) can also access Spanish nationality on softer terms than other foreigners: they require just 1 year of legal residence, and they are exempted from work restrictions. This law in practice also benefits the great-grandchildren of emigrant Spaniards as long as their grandparents (born outside of Spain) are/were original Spaniards.</p>

<p>Sorry poster #2, but &#8220;non-assimilable&#8221; immigrants are not wanted nor needed to begin with. These people are completely DIFFERENT races from us and there-in lies the real problem. NO White nation can survive taking in non-White peoples. Have we not learned that by now and from history?  Face reality and facts.</p>
<p>It makes my blood curl every time I hear these neocons say that &#8220;they only need to come in &#8220;legally&#8221; and/or assimilate into our culture and learn english. The ONLY people that can and did assimilate are those of European (White) nationalities, such as the Swedes, Germans, Dutch, etc.</p>

<p> Spain is bankrupt and has almost a 20% unemployment rate, yet the idiotic Socialist (pro working class?) Government is flooding the country with dubious mestizo citizens from Latin America? When will the Spanish people rise up and say&hellip; enough is enough!</p>

		<p>4-Anon &#8220;&ldquo;non-assimilable&rdquo; immigrants are not wanted nor needed to begin with&#8221; - I agree and recant. I hereby modify my statement as such: Change &#8220;high-levels&#8221; to read &#8220;allowance&#8221;. Whether the level of such immigration is low or high, the end result will be the destruction of the West. What was I thinking?&hellip;</p>

		<p>Anonymous #3: why would you consider someone who is 3/4 American Indian and 1/4 Spanish to be a &#8220;European Spaniard&#8221;? I haven&rsquo;t heard that there is anything in this law that requires anyone to be ethnically Spanish; they only have to be part Spanish, and that&rsquo;s not the same thing. If you know of any requirements that ALL of your grandparents must originally be from Spain, then please post a link to this information. If that is the case, then I have no objection to it.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t see the UK as a good example.  They have always been a vulnerable island, ripe for all kinds of attacks.  The UK has been artificially preserved by the US in the last century.  As our resources and capabilities dwindle under greed-driven leadership it is unlikely the US could do it again in the 21st century.  However, this attack is not using a military army.  What we are seeing is a force comprised not of educated, productive and dedicated immigrants.  We see an invasion by the least common denominator which is really quite clever if you think about it.  They send in millions of marching morons who will ultimately replace the native population by simply NOT assimilating.  They use the oldest trick in the book, strength in numbers.  The attack is self-coordinating by our own governments who create rules that magically include non-Americans.  This century is going to be very interesting.  The numbers are terrifying even to the Russians.  Who made this happen?<br>

		<p>This story illustrates the dangers of the creeping tyranny of central authority. Left to themselves, many of these countries would have denied them entry and deported them. But since the EU is making the rules their hands are tied. Sort of reminds you of the situation with Arizona doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
