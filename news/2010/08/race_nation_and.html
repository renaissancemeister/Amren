	<p>What accounts for the extraordinary expansion of British power in the 18th and 19th centuries? Most &#8220;respectable&#8221; academics offer economic reasons for British success against European powers, and take the view that Western technological superiority accounts for colonial expansion. My study of the British army of the Napoleonic era suggests a different explanation: the moral power of the British soldier, as manifested in his devotion to his regiment, to his nation and  &mdash;  when he was fighting colonial wars  &mdash;  to his race. Patriotic conviction together with contempt for foreigners made the average British soldier the best in the world.</p>

</div><p><b>The Invincible Duke</b></p>
<p>The British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington won 15 general engagements between 1808 and 1815 without suffering a single defeat. Its victories shattered the myth of French invincibility and inspired the resistance of the other European nations.</p>

</table><p>The most sincere assessment of British arms came from the enemy. The French marshal Nicolas Soult described the victors after his defeat at Albuera in 1811 with rueful sarcasm: &#8220;[T]here is no beating these troops in spite of their generals. I always thought they were bad soldiers; now I am sure of it. I had turned their right, pierced their center and everywhere victory was mine, but they did not know how to run.&#8221; Another French observers, General Chambray, praised the British infantry for its &#8220;orderliness, impetus and resolution to fight with the bayonet.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Prussian observer left this description of Wellington&rsquo;s army:<blockquote>&#8220;For a battle, there is not perhaps in Europe an army equal to the British, that is to say none whose tuition, discipline, and whole military tendency, is so purely and exclusively calculated to giving battle. The British soldier is vigorous, well-fed, by nature highly brave and intrepid, trained to the most rigorous discipline and admirably well-armed. The infantry resist the attack of cavalry with great confidence, and when taken in the flank or rear, British troops are less disconcerted than any other European Army.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Although it is the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s forces that are of particular interest to us here, the British infantry had long been redoubtable, and maintained its prowess well after the Iron Duke&rsquo;s day. A Spanish chronicler, writing in 1486, left us this description of a force of English bowmen:<blockquote>&#8220;This cavalier was from the island of England and brought with him a train of his vassals, men who had been hardened in certain civil wars which had raged in their country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They were withal of great pride, but it was not like our own inflammable Spanish pride.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [T]heir pride was silent and contumelious. Though from a remote and somewhat barbarous island, they yet believed themselves the most perfect men on earth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With all this, it must be said of them that they were marvelous good men in the field, dexterous archers and powerful with the battleaxe. In their great pride and self-will, they always sought to press in their advantage and take the post of danger.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They did not rush forward fiercely, or make a brilliant onset, like the Moorish and Spanish troops, but went into the fight deliberately and persisted obstinately and were slow to find out when they were beaten.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Likewise, in 1854, two years after Wellington&rsquo;s death, the armies he had commanded were still an astonishing force. The battle of Alma, during the Crimean War, gave rise to this first-hand account:<blockquote>&#8221;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Grenadiers and Coldstreamers [and Scots Guards], though under a deadly fire, formed into line with as much precision and lack of hurry as if they had been on the parade ground, and began deliberately to advance up the glacis toward the Great Redoubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an unforgettable sight. The men marched as if they were taking part in a review. Storm after storm of bullets, grape, shrapnel, and round shot tore through them, man after man fell, but the pace never altered, the line closed in and continued, &#8216;ceremoniously and with dignity,&rsquo; as an eyewitness wrote, on its way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Guards marched into the Great Redoubt, and there was a shout of triumph so loud that William Howard Russell [correspondent for <cite>The Times</cite>] heard it on the opposite bank  &mdash;  the battle of the Alma had been won.</p>
<p>&#8220;A French officer turned to [British Colonel] Evelyn Wood .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;Our men could not have done it,&rsquo; he said.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>How were the British capable of such feats of arms? It was partially the result of intense training. The great French military theorist Baron de Jomini believed only British troops were adequately trained to fight in a thin, two-deep battle line. It required a maximum of discipline to maneuver in this unwieldy formation; less trained troops required a deeper formation to maintain cohesion.</p>
<p>In addition, British troops displayed a tremendous corporate loyalty, not only to their regiments but to their nation. Almost alone among the armies of the 17th and 18th centuries, the British army possessed no permanent mercenary units. It was always a national force. As the historian of 18th century warfare, Christopher Duffy, writes: &#8220;the most pronounced moral traits of the English were violence and patriotism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All classes were united in their contempt for foreigners.&#8221; It was this ferocious patriotism that helped breed, in Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s words, &#8220;a peasantry of heroes.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>The uniquely nationalist sentiment of the English soldier dates back long into the past. To quote historian Linda Colley: &#8220;a popular sense of Englishness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. considerably predates the French Revolution.&#8221; An Italian visitor to England in 1548 described his hosts thus: &#8220;the English are commonly destitute of good breeding, and are despisers of foreigners, since they esteem him a wretched being and but half a man who may be born elsewhere than in Britain.&#8221; This was true not only of the aristocracy but of the common people as well. It was especially true of bowmen. They were of peasant stock but, in the words of the 15th century jurist, Sir John Fortescue, who fought at their side, they were the men whom &#8220;the might of the realm of England standyth upon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The English archers of the Middle Ages left no memoirs about their contempt for foreigners, but their successors in Wellington&rsquo;s time did.</p>
<p>Here is Private William Wheeler of the 51st Light Infantry on Britain&rsquo;s allies during the Peninsular War (1808&#150;1814):<blockquote>&#8220;What an ignorant, superstitious, priest-ridden, dirty, lousy set of poor devils are the Portuguese. Without seeing them it is impossible to conceive there exists a people in Europe so debased. The filthiest pigsty is a palace to the filthy houses in this dirty stinking city [Lisbon], all the dirt made in the houses is thrown into the streets, where it remains baking until a storm of rain washes it away. The streets are crowded with half-starved dogs, fat Priests and lousy people. The dogs should all be destroyed, the able-bodied Priests drafted into the Army, half the remainder should be made to keep the city clean, and the remainder if they did not inculcate the necessity of personal cleanliness should be hanged.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Sgt. John Cooper of the 7th Fusiliers was no more complimentary about Spaniards: &#8220;The lower orders of this nation are dirty in their persons, filthy in their habits, obscene in their language, and vindictive in their tempers. Their houses are intolerably smoky and vermin abound.&#8221;</p>
<p>Observations such as these are to be found throughout soldiers&rsquo; memoirs. About the military prowess of their Iberian allies, Sgt. William Lawrence of the 40th wrote: &#8220;the smell of powder often seemed to cause them to be missing when wanted.&#8221; Sgt. William Surtees of the 95th Rifles recalled the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s jest about a Spanish division fleeing the field from the Battle of Toulouse in 1814; Wellington &#8220;wondered whether the Pyrenees would bring them up again, they seemed to have got such a fright.&#8221; Surtees asserted that the Duke &#8220;did not indeed depend on their valour, or he would have made a bad winding up of his Peninsular campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>On first viewing a Spanish army, Sgt. Andrew Pearson of the 61st recalled: &#8220;Falstaff&rsquo;s ragged regiment would have done honour to any force compared to the men before us.&#8221; Surtees described the Spanish officer corps thus:<blockquote>&#8220;In short, they had all the pride, arrogance, and self-sufficiency of the best officers in the world, with the very least of all pretensions to have an high opinion of themselves; it is true they were not all alike, but the majority of them were the most haughty, and at the same time most contemptible creatures in the shape of officers, that I ever beheld.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>The British had an entirely different view of their own superiors. Rifleman John Harris of the 95th wrote this of his Brigadier, William Beresford:<blockquote>&#8220;He was equal to his business, too, I would say; and he amongst others of our generals, often made me think that the French army had nothing to show in the shape of officers who could at all compare to ours. There was a noble bearing in our leaders, which they, on the French side (as far as I was capable of observing) had not;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are a strange set, the English! and so determined and unconquerable, that they will have their way if they can. Indeed, it requires one who has authority in his face, as well as at his back, to make them respect and obey him.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Harris frankly believed that the British aristocracy produced the finest leaders of men in the world.</p>
<p>Britain was very much a class society, but in battle the shared characteristics of courage, stoicism and perseverance united all. Thomas Howell, of the 71st Highlanders, was a man of some gentility, who joined the army as a private as a result of financial disaster. He had a difficult time adjusting to life among men of a lower class. However, he left this moving account of his rough-hewn comrades during his first battle with the French:<blockquote>&#8220;In our first charge I felt my mind waver, a breathless sensation came over me. The silence was appalling. I looked alongst the line. It was enough to assure me. The steady, determined scowl of my companions assured my heart and gave me determination. How unlike the noisy advance of the French!&#8221;
</blockquote><p>During the Peninsular War, the British had a far higher regard for their enemy than for their allies. They regarded the French as brave, if erratic, soldiers and generally chivalrous. One of the few really negative descriptions comes from Sgt. Edward Costello of the 95th Rifles, and it is a condemnation of only a specific group of men rather than of the French nation. It casts light on those qualities that either impressed or revolted British soldiers.</p>
<p>After the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo in 1812, some French prisoners were present at the interment of British dead:<blockquote>&#8220;One more careless than the rest viewed the occurrence with a kind of malicious sneer, which so enraged our men that one of them, taking the little tawny-looking Italian by the nape of his neck, kicked his hind-quarters soundly for it. I could not, at the time, help remarking the very under-sized appearance of the Frenchmen. They were the ugliest set I ever saw, and seemed to be the refuse of their army, and looked more like Italians than Frenchmen.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Wellington&rsquo;s men had a stoic pride that, in their minds, set them apart from men of any other nationality. A remarkable incident was recorded by Sgt. Edward Costello when he was recovering from a wound received at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812. His hospital ward was under the charge of a fellow Irishman, Sgt. Michael Connelly:<blockquote>&#8220;Mike was exceedingly attentive to the sick, and particularly anxious that the British soldier, when dying, should hold out a pattern of firmness to the Frenchmen who lay intermixed with us in the same wards. &#8216;Hould your tongue, ye blathering devil,&rsquo; he would say in a low tone, &#8216;and don&rsquo;t be after disgracing your country in the teeth of these ere furriners, by dying hard. Ye&rsquo;ll have company at your burial, won&rsquo;t you? Ye&rsquo;ll have the drums beating and the guns firing over ye, won&rsquo;t ye?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For God&rsquo;s sake, die like a man before these &rsquo;ere Frenchers.&rsquo;&#8221;
</blockquote><p>After Waterloo, Costello again found himself in hospital, this time in Brussels, and recorded something even more remarkable: <blockquote>&#8220;I remained in Brussels three days, and had ample means here, as in several other places, such as Salamanca, &c.;, for witnessing the cutting off of legs and arms. The French I have ever found to be brave, yet I cannot say they will undergo a surgical operation with the cool, unflinching spirit of a British soldier. An incident which came under my notice may in some measure show the differences of the two nations. An English soldier belonging to, if I recollect rightly, the 1st Royal Dragoons, evidently an old weather-beaten warfarer, while undergoing the amputation of an arm below the elbow, held the injured limb in his other hand without betraying the slightest emotion, save occasionally helping out his pain by spirting forth the proceeds of a large plug of tobacco, which he chewed most unmercifully while under the operation. Near to him was a Frenchman, bellowing lustily, while a surgeon was probing for a ball near the shoulder. This seemed to annoy the Englishman more than anything else, and so much so, that as soon as his arm was amputated, he struck the Frenchman a smart blow across the breech with the severed limb, holding it at the wrist, saying, &#8216;Here, take that, and stuff it down your throat, and stop your damn bellowing!&rsquo;&#8221;

</table><p>Warfare against non-Europeans inspired a far greater sense of distance and alienness. John Shipp of the 87th, the only man of his era to win two commissions from the ranks, wrote of battle against the &#8220;Caffres&#8221; of South Africa:<blockquote>&#8220;At every farmhouse in our line of march we found appalling scenes of murder and desolation. Whole families had been massacred by these wild people, whose devastations it was now our duty to check. So ignorant were they, that I am convinced they were unaware that murder is a crime.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The savage Caffre exults in these appalling sights. To his bestial mind the groans of the wounded, and the dying, are the greatest of pleasures. When the frenzy of the attack is on him he is wrought up to ecstasy, dancing and jumping about, and hauling spears at man or beast with reckless abandon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have seen them with [murdered] women&rsquo;s gowns, petticoats, shawls and things tied round their legs and between their toes, capering about the woods in a frenzy of delight.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Sgt. George Calladine of the 19th recalled his first encounter with Africans: &#8220;I certainly saw little naked children running about which, if I had seen nothing of them but their faces, I should have taken them for monkeys.&#8221; Sgt. Pearson wrote of the &#8220;Caffres&#8221; with more sympathy, marveling at their physiques: &#8220;six feet six inches to seven feet, with most symmetrical figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>William Richardson was a common seamen who served in the Royal Navy between 1793 and 1819. Before being impressed into the Navy he served on several merchant vessels, including a slaver. He recorded his impressions of the trade:<blockquote>&#8220;Some people in England think that we hunt and catch the slaves ourselves, but this is a mistaken idea, for we get them by barter as follows: their petty kings and traders get them not so much by wars (as is imagined) as by trade and treachery, and when they get a number for sale bring them to the coast and sell them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was one of their petty kings who, when he came on board, would strut along the deck as if he had been one of the greatest men in the world: he was a little fat fellow dressed in a suit of coarse blue cloth edged with something like yellow worsted, but what spoiled all was that he had no shirt, shoes or stockings on, and his naked black feet and legs being dabbed over with mud and salt water, made him a laughingstock to the sailors; but did not put him out of conceit of himself.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Colonial wars were not confined to Africa. Thomas Howell of the 71st Highlanders recorded his none too flattering impressions of the Indians of Montevideo:<blockquote>&#8220;The native women were the most uncomely I ever beheld. They have broad noses, thick lips, and are of very small stature. Their hair, which is long, black and hard to the feel, they wear frizzled up in front in the most hideous manner, while it hangs down their backs below the waist. When they dress they stick in it feathers and flowers, and walk about in all the pride of ugliness. The men .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are brave, but indolent to excess.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As for their idleness, I have seen them lie stretched, for a whole day, gazing upon the river, and their wives bring them their victuals; and if they were not pleased with the quantity, they would beat them furiously. This is the only exertion they make willingly  &mdash;  venting their fury upon their wives.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>These remarks concerning the physical characteristics of Africans and Indians (not to mention Latins) point to the British soldier&rsquo;s racial consciousness as part of his patriotism. This is not to say that the British soldier loathed non-European foes because of race; it was because of the latter&rsquo;s savagery. Sgt. James Thompson served with the 78th Highlanders at Quebec in 1759, during one of the North American campaigns of the Seven Years War. He witnessed the repulse of a British attack on the Ile d&rsquo;Orleans: &#8220;When the French saw us far enough on the retreat, they sent their savages to scalp and tomahawk our poor fellows that lay wounded on the beach.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the War of 1812, British troops this time found themselves allied to Indians. Historian Donald Graves describes an event that took place after the Battle of Lundy&rsquo;s Lane in 1814: &#8220;Sergeant Commins of the 8th and Private Byfield of the 41st watched with horror as an Indian &#8216;busy in plundering came to an American that had been severely wounded and not being able to get the man&rsquo;s boots off threw him into the fire.&rsquo; A nearby British regular &#8216;filled with indignation for such barbarity shot the Indian and threw him onto the fire to suffer for his unprincipled villainy.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

</table><p>Sgt. William Lawrence of the 40th described a grisly encounter with Indians near Buenos Aires in 1807. A corporal and a private were killed while destroying native huts: &#8220;This was a great glory to the natives; they stuck the corporal&rsquo;s head on a pole and carried it in front of their little band on the march.&#8221; Later: &#8220;As we marched along on our next day&rsquo;s journey, about two hundred Indians kept following us, the foremost of them wearing our dead corporal&rsquo;s jacket, and carrying his head  &mdash;  I do not know for what reason, but perhaps they thought a good deal more of a dead man&rsquo;s head than we should feel disposed to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later the 200 Indians attacked Lawrence&rsquo;s party of 20 infantrymen and were easily repulsed, they &#8220;not liking the smell and much less the taste of our gunpowder.&#8221; The Indian chief who carried the corporal&rsquo;s head was wounded and captured by the British. He was not killed out of hand but was treated according to civilized custom and left with friendly Indians to be nursed back to health.</p>
<p>It did not take long for non-Europeans to discover and profit from the differences between British and native warfare. Sir Evelyn Wood writes of interrogating Zulu prisoners in 1879 after the battle of Kambula:<blockquote>&#8220;When I had obtained all the information I required I said, &#8216;Before Isandwhlana [an 1879 battle in which a Zulu army of 20,000 routed and massacred 800 encamped British infantry] we treated all your wounded men in our hospital. But when you attacked our camp your brethren, our black patients, rose and helped to kill those who had been attending on them. Can any of you advance any reason why I should not kill you?&rsquo; One of the younger men, with an intelligent face, asked, &#8216;May I speak?&rsquo; &#8216;Yes.&rsquo; &#8216;There is a very good reason why you should not kill us. We kill you because it is the custom of the black men [to kill prisoners]. But it isn&rsquo;t the white man&rsquo;s custom.&rsquo;&#8221;
</blockquote><p>The Englishman reportedly had no answer to this, and the blacks were later freed.</p>
<p>When it came to actual warfare against non-white armies, the popular conception is of an unfair contest with European colonial troops discharging advanced weaponry on natives armed with sticks and clubs. The truth was often quite different. In discussing Wellington&rsquo;s great victory over a Mahratta (Indian) army six times the size of his own at Assaye in 1803, historian Jeremy Black points out that &#8220;success owed much to a bayonet charge, scarcely conforming to the standard image of Western armies gunning down masses of non-European troops relying on cold steel.&#8221; This contemporary historian refrains from analyzing how that small red-coated force achieved its moral triumph, and certainly does not discuss any patriotic or racialist motivations it may have possessed. The British commander knew better.</p>
<p>The Duke of Wellington is notorious for describing his infantry as the &#8220;scum of the earth.&#8221; Yet this was most of all a description of their social class and their vices (drink above all). In battle, the British soldier was &#8220;the item upon which victory depends.&#8221; On his return from India in 1804, Wellington wrote a memorandum in which he offered an explanation for the incredible achievements of the British, especially in India. It should be studied by all military &#8220;experts&#8221; who would deride the importance of national (and racial) feeling among soldiers:<blockquote>&#8220;The English soldiers are the main foundation of the British power in Asia. They are a body with habits, manners and qualities peculiar to them in the East Indies. Bravery is the characteristic of the British army in all quarters of the world; but no other quarter has afforded such striking examples of the existence of this quality in the soldiers as the East Indies. An instance of their misbehavior in the field has never been known; and particularly those who have been for some time in that country cannot be ordered upon any service, however dangerous or arduous, that they will not effect, not only with bravery, but a degree of skill not often witnessed in persons of their description in other parts of the world. I attribute these qualities, which are peculiar to them in the East Indies, to the distinctness of their class in that country from all others existing in it. They feel they are a distinct and superior class to the rest of the world which surrounds them; and their actions correspond with their high notions of their own superiority.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Their weaknesses and vices, however repugnant to the feelings and prejudices of the Natives, are passed over in the contemplation of their excellent qualities as soldiers, of which no nation has hitherto given such extraordinary instances. These qualities are the foundation of the British strength in Asia, and of that opinion by which it is generally supposed that the British empire has been gained and upheld. These qualities show in what manner nations, consisting of millions, are governed by 30,000 strangers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Thus it was through a sense of national superiority, of the white Briton as a being apart, that the British Empire was won and held. Years later, Wellington would state plainly (in a parliamentary debate on Asian Indian participation in the higher levels of the Civil Service): &#8220;That the white man has an influence [of a moral kind] which the black man has not.&#8221; Wellington would scarcely have been able to credit the notion that one day British governments would discourage racial feelings among their soldiers. He praised the racial arrangements in the Southern United States, and considered them essential if America&rsquo;s liberal system of government was to survive.</p>
<p>An understanding of the role of race has not entirely died among the British. A ranker (a soldier holding a rank other than that of officer) of the Second World War has left us with an analysis of the motivations of his comrades in Burma. George MacDonald Fraser&rsquo;s bluntly honest account (put to paper in 1992) should ring as a battle cry for anyone interested in his own nation&rsquo;s defense:<blockquote>&#8220;There is much talk today of guilt as an aftermath of wars  &mdash;  guilt over killing the enemy, and even guilt for surviving. Much depends on the circumstances, but I doubt if many of the Fourteenth Army lose much sleep over dead Japanese. For one thing they were a no-surrender enemy and if we hadn&rsquo;t killed them they would surely have killed us. But there was more to it than that. It may appall a generation who have been dragooned into considering racism the ultimate crime, but I believe there was a feeling (there was in me) that the Jap was farther down the human scale than the European. It is a feeling that I see reflected today in institutions and people who would deny hotly that they are subconscious racists  &mdash;  the presence of TV cameras ensured a superficial concern for the Kurdish refugees and Bangladeshi flood victims, but we all know that the Western reaction would have been immeasurably greater if a similar disaster had occurred in Australia or Canada or Europe; some people seem to count more than others, with liberals as well as reactionaries, and it is folly to feel that racial kinship and likeness are not at the bottom of it.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>A measured statement such as this would not be tolerated in America, and this bodes ill for the future, especially the future of our armed forces. As long as the basic principle of racial kinship is denied by our leaders, America&rsquo;s very existence will be in peril. There can be no stability in a society which will not allow its members to favor their own brethren. An army that will deny its soldiers this right is an army on the road to defeat.</p>

<p>Right there is the secret of white nationalism and military prowess.  Whites will viciously conquer and destroy ANYTHING they are told to by a strong leader.  This pattern has shown up repeatedly over the last 100 years are so.</p>
<p>And it shows what whites who are angry at the dissolution of the white world need to look for.</p>
<p>Because sooner or later another Wellington is going to rise.</p>

		<p>During the American Revolution the British Army encouraged slaves to fight for their freedom.  This passage in the Declaration of Independence complains about it, &#8220;He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
After the American Revolution the British Navy took the lead in suppressing the slave trade.<br>

		<p>My father was in the British army from 1936 to 1961, serving in India and West Africa, and the racial and patriotic attitudes expressed in this article were very much alive in his time. He shared them himself, always aware that however likeable a non-white might be, he was a breed apart whose immigration into our racial homeland was unthinkable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that this article first appeared in 1997, the year after racial equality training and quotas were first introduced into what was left of the British army. Fortunately for my father he was long dead by then.</p>

		<p>Verily, I shall puke at this nonsense. While it is undeniably true that the feats of British arms were impressive against native peoples in the 19th Century, I doubt that they&rsquo;d have prevailed against the North Vietnamese Army during our war with those tough and determined little men.  In point of fact, any British army of any era would have had the living tar kicked out of it by the NVA, whom I fought in 1965-66 and 1967-68.  And let&rsquo;s not forget that an amateur army of American colonists whipped British regulars in our own war of independence.  Or that the Germans routed the BEF in 1940 with a numerically inferior force, and the Japanese did likewise against British possessions throughout Southeast Asia in 1941.</p>

		<p>If the British army was so successful against France&rsquo;s Napoleonic armies, I wonder how and why the Invalides museum in Paris has such a large room full of captured British flags? The author also failed to mention the shameful drunken rampage of murder, plunder and rape that Wellington&rsquo;s army committed after the capture of San Rodrigo, when the British troops essentially mutinied for two days, before Woolsey/Wellington could regain control of them. The progenitors of today&rsquo;s British football hooligans? The mistreatment of British sailors was so bad that instead of sailing for &#8216;dear old England&rsquo;, they mutinied en-masse in the Great Mutiny of 1799. The race denying British do indeed have &#8216;grit&rsquo;, evidently, that&rsquo;s why they are known as &#8220;Johnny Bulls&#8221;</p>

		<p>England has always been a great nation.  While no longer the greatest empire the world has ever known, it still provides a moral compass and beacon of inspiration to the entire planet.  Most, if not all, successful modern militaries are based on the British model.  (My knowledgeable husband, who actually dislikes the English, told me this.)  Most of American culture comes from Britain, and the U.K. remains our strongest ally.  We share a formidable fighting spirit that neither overextention of resources (end of the Empire) or overconfidence (loss at Islandwhlana) can diminish.  Think of the Blitz, and you know what the English fighting spirit truly is!  No nation has invaded Britain since 1066, when William the Conqueror landed.  Its gutsy citizens held the Nazi&rsquo;s formidable fighting machine at bay until America could bring her resources to the front.  Together, we saved the world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;Can any of you advance any reason why I should not kill you?&rsquo; One of the younger men, with an intelligent face, asked, &lsquo;May I speak?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;There is a very good reason why you should not kill us. We kill you because it is the custom of the black men [to kill prisoners]. But it isn&rsquo;t the white man&rsquo;s custom.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>NOT only did the Zulu kill prisoners, but they slit the belly open too subsequently. This was according to Zulu belief the spirit of the dead could thus leave the body. All of those English dead at Isandlhwana had their bellies slit open. This was interpreted as bloody savagery by the English but according to the Zulu was following their [Zulu] custom.</p>

		<p>What about the Prussian soldier? The Boer soldier in the South African War? But yes, warfare tactics has changed through the ages and no country should be complacent about this.</p>
<p>@John #4:</p>
<p>I am a veteran of our S.A. Bush War and have read quite a few Vietnam books which happen to drift by in our local library. Most certainly Vietnam was a vicious war, the stuff of nightmares.</p>
<p>After reading these books I wondered what are the Vietnam veterans (must be in the age group 55 - 85, Vietnam war was 1955 - 1975) thinking about the current America?</p>
<p>Googling &#8216;vietnam veteran anti obama&rsquo; does not deliver any sensible results. But all races were called up for Vietnam, so I do not know what the white veterans think.</p>
<p>I would guess, as we white veterans, you also are fuming with anger and the feeling of helplessness.</p>

		<p>At Islandlwhana in 1879, the British force was split up - a reliable recepie for disaster - and largely defeated in detail after ammunition could no longer be brought from the supply wagons to the assailed positions.  A little later a company of Welshmen taught the Zulus a rather sharp lesson at Rourke&rsquo;s Drift.</p>
<p>While the British were forced to withdraw at Dunkirk in 1940, the German General staff - who knew a thing or two about fighting wars - classed the 51st Highland infantry division as the most &#8220;furchtbar&#8221; or dangerous allied division during both world wars (they also had the utmost respect for the US 88th division in Italy - at a time when they tended to consider US troops as fairly mediocre, rated the 88th division as &#8220;shock troops&#8221;.  Note also that this was at a time when the US military was segregated.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to make a comparison of the British army at various times with the NVA.  The correct approach to counterinsurgency was that of Oskar Dirlewanger when fighting partisans in the forests around Minsk.  The French recruited German mercenaries in their occupied zone for fighting against the Vietminh - I don&rsquo;t know whether the exact description will make it past the censor, so I will say that these mercenaries were manifestly not former Wehrmacht.  The &#8220;Devil&rsquo;s Guard&#8221; behaved like they were back in Russia again, and scared the daylights out of the Vietminh.  Unfortunately, the sissies at the UN made the French cut that out and the stage was set for Dien Bien Phu.</p>

<p>Those soldiers were only guarding supplies, they were too much dispersed and the British officier in charge didn&rsquo;t bother to have the ammunition crates unsealed or an entrenchment prepared before the battle or have a proper scouting. </p>
<p>From Wikipedia :<br>
&#8220;Near the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at Rorke&rsquo;s Drift. It was defended by only 139 British soldiers who inflicted serious casualties upon the attacking Zulus, and successfully beat them back.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The British Army was sent packing by the American Revolutionaries. One weapon the Americans had was the Irish soldier. It is said that Cornwallis was so aggrieved by the Irish efforts that he returned to Ireland and savagely murdered many civilians. Funny that wasnt covered in my grade school history classess!! There is a story,perhaps apocryphal,of the French king hearing the complaints of the French generals about the Irish regiment the French army employed(refugees from the genocide in Ireland by the glorious British army). &#8220;The Irish,&#8221;lamented the generals with regard to their behavior,&#8221;cause me more problems than all the rest of the French army combined!&#8221; &#8220;That,&#8221; replied the King,&#8221;is what the English say!&#8221; </p>

		<p>Good article! And I wholeheartedly vouch for Portuguese degeneracy. Martial spirit is much accurately displayed in defensive battles with European kin rather than conquering some stick-weilding 3rd Worlders, which is why Soviet/Russian historiography doesn&rsquo;t emphasize what few battles with natives happened during the conquest of Siberia, focusing on its defensive wars instead. The Alamo, The War of 1812, the Confederacy in the Civil War, the Napoleonic Wars, the 100 Years War are your true pride</p>

		<p>@4,</p>
<p>There is actually a lesson to be taken from the British system however in that, had it been applied to Vietnam, there would have been no secure rear area to act as home and hearth logistics base.</p>
<p>The tough little men of SEA, whether Japanese or Vietnamese, died mostly from the common ailments of the jungle.  They were not superior to whites or any other race in this.  To assume otherwise is itself an act of detrimental racism, at odds with the unit combat diaries maintained, with due diligence, to cover the deaths by number and cause. </p>
<p>If you destroy the narrow end of the logistics funnel, across the DMZ, all forms of Resistance in the South would have crumbled entirely.  The British knew this and would never have failed to act upon it.  Much as the SADF enacted &#8216;externals&rsquo; to wipe out ANC hideouts across the borders of modern Mozambique and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>As for India, what made the British &#8216;system&rsquo; successful there was several hundred years of established racism.  &#8216;Caste = Class&rsquo; where _even within a given racial subtype_ there were distinctions of &#8216;those who are not to be associated with&rsquo; for much the same inferior-bloodline reasons.</p>
<p>Dump one hated royalist establishment for a civil one and sustain all the existing caste` belief systems (&#8220;What, the British left?  When did they invade?&#8221;) and you&rsquo;ll niche right in.</p>
<p>FWIW, you see much the same attitude in Mexico.  The further south you go, the more desperate the situation and the more contempt the high caste northerners feel.  Indians have nothing and resent their existence as a function of isolation behind their skin.  Mestizos hate Indians as being beneath them and level themselves above or below other Mestizos based on pallor of skin.  And the &#8216;Whites&rsquo; who are so by purchased genetics, rule them all by narrow class access to an entirely nepotistic system of privilege, starting with education.</p>
<p>Never fail to understand that exploiting envy is as much a function of colonialism as fear of martial ferocity.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t all that relevant really to he point the article makes, the Zulus won an impressive battle and were fearsome warriors, nobody can seriously dispute that, but it was their only victory. The rest of the engagements in the Zulu war were lopsided British victories (see the movie &#8220;Zulu&#8221; for an idea of how things went) and the Zulu Empire was extinguished after a total defeat by the British.</p>
<p>Anyway if you demand an answer if you run out of ammo or the fighting goes hand to hand, suddenly a spear and a shield are not such bad weapons to have. Also single shot rifles only do so much against an endless sea of charging Africans. The union army held little roundtop in the Battle of Gettysburg by resorting to a bayonet charge after running out of ammo. Nothing is ever certain in warfare.</p>

		<p>Love this article, and that it was written by an American (presumably) with a non-English surname.</p>
<p>@4 Not an expert on either of those wars, but are you sure the British were &#8216;whipped&rsquo; in 1776? Did America actually win most of the battles as well as the war? Are you sure that most of the British army were professionals, given they were fighting France and Spain at the same time? Were not many of the &#8216;British&rsquo; soldiers black? Would the US have won it without French intervention? Did the lack of political will in London not contribute?</p>
<p>You think the British would have done worse than the US in Vietnam? Considering the various performances in Iraq and Afghanistan it seems unlikely.</p>
<p>@5 the British were always outnumbered by the French on land and lost most battles against them. Sometimes war is about taking numbers, disrupting food supplies and ensuring things are even for the vital battle, which is exactly what the British did. You have got to bear in mind that Britain had half the population of France at the time and was far less militarised.</p>
<p>@6 It happened because the British could not reload their guns fast enough. Guns that sit on the floor and point straight ahead are not difficult to avoid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before Isandwhlana [an 1879 battle in which a Zulu army of 20,000 routed and massacred 800 encamped British infantry]&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an extremely inconvenient event for for the theme of this article. An unknown number, nonetheless much larger force, of Zulus armed with cow hide shields and sticks attacked a British position and wiped out a force of 1300 troops (800 regular British Army) armed with the most modern breech loading rifles. </p>
<p>Instead of almost pretending this didn&rsquo;t happen, the author should try to explain how it happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I can explain it.  The contrast between the disaster of Isandiwanna and Roark&rsquo;s Drift, which began as the first was ending, illustrates it well.  The British army did not expect to be attacked so soon, and its leaders allowed the 1,700 to 2,000 troops and colonial militialmen to camp in the open with no established perimeters or even simple &#8220;laggering&#8221; (circling of wagons).  So when the 20,000 Zulus attacked, it was a surprise, defenses were inadequate and 1,300 casualties resulted.  The other contributing factor was the way ammunition was cased and distributed.  The boxes were tin packed and required time to loose.  There was only one point of distribution and many troops simply ran out of ammunition.  Modern acheology has confirmed that the perimeter was too large, making amunition distribution difficult.  After this battle ammunition boxes were opened as a routine when any encampment was made.  Blame was placed on the leadership (Lord Chelmsford) for having taken such a casual encampment.</p>
<p>Contrast to that to Roark&rsquo;s drift, where by the evening of Isandiwanna, that battle was in full swing.  Just over 100 men, including wounded troops, 138 total, held off 3-4,000 Zulu warriors.  They had a small misson station and outbuildings for making their defence.  They used a couple wagons and many grain sacks for constructing their barriers.  They held the Zulus off for two days before the Zulus, famously, saluted them and went home.</p>
<p>A military fact in tactics is that a small, well defended narrow (natural or man-made) can be defended against a much larger force successfully. </p>
<p>Even though the Brits did have single shot Henry-Martinis, some Zulus also had them, taken from the defeated British troops, as well as older guns they owned.  Although not formally trained with them, they were a problem at both engagements.</p>

<p>&gt; The British Army fought NVA like people all over India, Indonesia, China, Afghanistan, et., etc., most of the time, successfully.  You seem to want to pluck a Martini-Henry toting Johnny out of the Victorian period and land him in the Jungle in 1967.  The British carried themselves quite well in that part of the world in WW2, after they recovered from the initial shock of the Japanese invasions.  Just because we managed our war so badly doesn&rsquo;t mean that The British have to be worse.  No one can know.  But perhaps that they were smart enough not to engage in a land war in Asia in the late 20th century shows that superiority?  Their historical record contradicts your bragadocio.  As for the European field, the British has more military victories since 1066, than any other nation.  You seem to have some other problem going on here.  But I sympathize with you, I am of that era myself. </p>
<p>&#8220;And let&rsquo;s not forget that an amateur army of American colonists whipped British regulars in our own war of independence.&#8221; </p>
<p>&gt; Is it possible that you don&rsquo;t realize that The French actually won our Revolution for us?  They French crown went broke assisting us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or that the Germans routed the BEF in 1940 with a numerically inferior force, and the Japanese did likewise against British possessions throughout Southeast Asia in 1941.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt; The BEF was not numerically superior to the Germans.  Where did you get that?  The Japanese blew away the US Navy at Pearl Harbor in 1941, and captured hundreds of Americans in the Phillipines at the same time.  How did the allies win that war?</p>
<p>&#8220;The NVA and the Viet Cong could not have won without the military assistance of the Soviet Union. The French and Japanese held Indo-China quite securely until the Cold War.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; And the British held Taiwan and Formosa until 1997.</p>
<p>Really, your unreasonable hatred of the British is overwhelming you.<br>

<p>&#8220;Love this article, and that it was written by an American (presumably) with a non-English surname.</p>
<p>@4 Not an expert on either of those wars, but are you sure the British were &lsquo;whipped&rsquo; in 1776? Did America actually win most of the battles as well as the war? Are you sure that most of the British army were professionals, given they were fighting France and Spain at the same time? Were not many of the &lsquo;British&rsquo; soldiers black? Would the US have won it without French intervention? Did the lack of political will in London not contribute?&#8221;</p>
<p>During the 18 -19th century, there a total of 11 black troops in the British army, none of which ever saw service in America.  I looked it up.<br>

@4,</p>
<p>&#8220;There is actually a lesson to be taken from the British system however in that, had it been applied to Vietnam, there would have been no secure rear area to act as home and hearth logistics base.</p>
<p>The tough little men of SEA, whether Japanese or Vietnamese, died mostly from the common ailments of the jungle. They were not superior to whites or any other race in this. To assume otherwise is itself an act of detrimental racism, at odds with the unit combat diaries maintained, with due diligence, to cover the deaths by number and cause. </p>
<p>If you destroy the narrow end of the logistics funnel, across the DMZ, all forms of Resistance in the South would have crumbled entirely. The British knew this and would never have failed to act upon it. Much as the SADF enacted &lsquo;externals&rsquo; to wipe out ANC hideouts across the borders of modern Mozambique and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>As for India, what made the British &lsquo;system&rsquo; successful there was several hundred years of established racism. &lsquo;Caste = Class&rsquo; where _even within a given racial subtype_ there were distinctions of &lsquo;those who are not to be associated with&rsquo; for much the same inferior-bloodline reasons.</p>
<p>Dump one hated royalist establishment for a civil one and sustain all the existing caste` belief systems (&ldquo;What, the British left? When did they invade?&rdquo;) and you&rsquo;ll niche right in.</p>
<p>Never fail to understand that exploiting envy is as much a function of colonialism as fear of martial ferocity.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a wierd set of statements!</p>
<p>1. The US knew the key lay in destroying Northern manufacturing, ports, supply lines, etc.  The hesitation was because of politics.  Vietnam was a political proxy war, that NO army could have won without risking a much larger, and hugely devastating war.  You must be young.  Everyone knew the fingers were right on &#8220;The Button&#8221; in those days.</p>
<p>2. There are many corrected records of battle casualities from that war.  The civilian and combatant totals are nearly 2 million.  Disease was not a large factor for Americans, certianly, but drug availability was&hellip;</p>
<p>3. Untouchables, you mean?  There are actually old historic reasons pre-British Indian reasons for these prejudices.  The British actually worked hard at uniting India, opposing tribal warfare.  The India of today still has &#8220;untouchables,&#8221; and class distinctions.  This is not a fault of the British.  If not for the British rule, India would likely be similar to Afghanistan today, a place of warring tribes.</p>
<p>Divide and conquer has always been a prime issue in political/military tactics.  But primitive peoples divide among themselves, just as Europeans did up to WW2.  So your point is questionable and vague.</p>
<p>As posted elsewhere; If one does not believe in their superiority, they cannot hope to win.  They become the vanquished.  There is always someone wishing to vanquish. Rather be the winner than the loser?  O is self-righteous defeat a victory?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s gratifying to read an article like this; certainly the British confidence in themselves and their way of life enabled them to be as successful as they were. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s depressing that so many of the commenters here seem to feel compelled to disparage or belittle &#8221;the Brits&#8221;; it seems many of today&rsquo;s Americans still hold grudges over what, the Revolution? Most of my ancestors of that time period fought for this country&rsquo;s independence from Britain but at the same time they certainly did not hate the British or regard them as aliens or foreigners; the colonists thought of themselves as English by descent and by culture. The Founding Fathers said that the colonists were fighting only for their &#8221;rights as Englishmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember, our colonists forebears were English, for the most part.</p>

<p>That the young white American boy still aspires to the military and does so in a voluntary manner and is willing to fight in a place thousands of miles from home and do so even with multiple deployments is surprising. Military service among the average white in American is still seen as honorable duty. And most of the combat arms troops now are white as well. When they started the all-volunteer army almost forty years ago, that was not anticipated. And the more dangerous the combat arms, the more white is the unit.<br>

		<p>Yeah,  the British are realy a great fighting force. After years of unsuccessfully trying to defeat the white Afrikaaners in the Boer wars they resorted to burning the Afrikaaners farm houses and crops then putting the women and children into concentration camps. Thousands of said women and children died as a result of starvation and disease <br>
The British don&rsquo;t boast about that do they?</p>

		<p>Excellent article. Thank you.</p>
<p>What does amaze me however is the number of snivelling responses from some commenter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In what way will an anti-British, anti-European attitude help america survive against being overwhelmed by third worlders and Islam? If you so detest us then why should we be your allies? Why should our soldiers fight alongside yours in Afghanistan? &hellip;.especially as American companies will profit from the mineral resources exploited there whereas we just lose blood and treasure..</p>
<p>If you think that insulting the rest of the white race and creating even more enemies than you already have then so be it.</p>
<p>Oh, and @4 you say &#8220;And let&rsquo;s not forget that an amateur army of American colonists whipped British regulars in our own war of independence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you such a fool as not to realise that the people on both sides were British? That nearly all of your founding fathers were of British decent, spoke better English than you and were often educated in Britain?</p>
<p>The American war of Independence was not a war between nations - it was a war about an idea of liberty.</p>
<p>It was the British fighting amongst themselves&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>A lot of the British Army in the American war of independence were German mercenaries. In fact Britain used to rely upon a lot of mercenaries to fight wars on land. Something like over 50% of the British Army in India was made up of Indians. </p>
<p>The Royal Navy was Britain&rsquo;s strength and it was this where it excelled all over powers. </p>

		<p>As a student of military history I&rsquo;m glad this article is featured. Though the British comments on the Spaniards and Portuguese probably sprang from envy towards two nations  who ruled the world before them, and the haughty attitudes of the Latins were probably triggered by resentment at seeing the British as upstarts who they had to kowtow to, history has proven the Brits to be one of the great military nations of the world. And certainly, race and pride of country contributed much to that success.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;the presence of TV cameras ensured a superficial concern for the Kurdish refugees and Bangladeshi flood victims, but we all know that the Western reaction would have been immeasurably greater if a similar disaster had occurred in Australia or Canada or Europe; some people seem to count more than others, with liberals as well as reactionaries, and it is folly to feel that racial kinship and likeness are not at the bottom of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kudos to Mr. Fraser for so simply and eloquently explaining the concept of group competition to any member of the Great Unwashed who, after 12 years of inculcation with neo-Marxist balderdash, has lost touch with one of humanity&rsquo;s most basic instincts.</p>

		<p>Great article. Sure, many caveats apply, but clearly on the battlefield not all cultures are equal. </p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a bigger issue here that&rsquo;s outside the scope of this article, but that I think is worth addressing. </p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s martial prowess, like that of all European peoples, has not translated into the things needed for strong demographics. Quite the opposite, in fact. </p>
<p>The admirable pluck and discipline of British soldiers in World War I didn&rsquo;t translate into a better life for their children. It only contributed to a demographic disaster for Britain, and all European nations. </p>
<p>In some ways now it&rsquo;s better   &mdash;   mass casualties aren&rsquo;t tolerated. And in other ways it&rsquo;s worse. </p>
<p>Today, when Western powers go to war, the results   &mdash;   when we succeed   &mdash;   are stronger societies, for other people. For immediate family and kin of those who fight, however, it can mean death, disability, post-traumatic stress   &mdash;   at worst   &mdash;   and a shiny medal and a nice pension, at best. </p>
<p>There really is no percentage, so to speak, for Westerners to send their sons to war. It&rsquo;s one reason we find casualties so much less acceptable, and one reason why the martial tradition is dying in this culture. </p>

		<p>As Daniel O&rsquo;Conell pointed out in Parliament, a great many names of the dead at Alma and elsewhere were  Irish. I can&rsquo;t imagine any Irishman worthy of the name calling himself English. Also, the best troops in the British Army were and are the Gorkahs, a distinctly non-English race. What made Britain great were her free institutions of law and commerce, which provided the foundation to project influence. China is now attempting the same. Caveat on the racial inferences.</p>

<p>England is not a moral compass, anymore than the criminals in the U.S. congress or senate represent the people of America. England has allowed the muslims and blacks (usually the same thing) to take over and hijack their country, as is happening in our own country. I&rsquo;ve been to England a number of times and in SOOOOOO many places, one would think you are in Karachi, Pakistan instead of a Western country. The same is true of my trips to France, seems the country is going total black African muslim&hellip;NON English or French speaking blacks run the customs gates at CDG airport and they are also slow, very rude and incompetent.

A modern English military professor once taught his cadets that:  &#8220;since Wellington, the English-speaking peoples have birthed but two other great military tacticians:  Generals R.E. Lee and &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson.&#8221;  President Lincoln once queried General Winfield Scott why Richmond could not be taken with 100,000 men when Mexico City was taken with only 5,000 men?

<p>One could trumpet the success of every one of the above and attribute it to their race or ethnicity. I don&rsquo;t think the British are anything special here, save for the fact that they might have had an undue advantage due to possession of modern weapons compared to many natives in other parts of the world.<br>

   I suggest that you know nothing of Viet-Nam, or perhaps the world in general. When Ho Chi Minh (you should learn more about him) was told at the Paris peace talks that we would bomb NVN into the stone age, he retorted loudly,&#8221;WE ARE THE STONE AGE&#8221; Learn more before you make such sweeping statements and the French did not control Viet-Nam after early 1942 the Japanese did until 1945, at which time WE forced the Viets to submit to the French AGAIN! at which point we arrested Ho and Nguyen Giap and then Ho said he would run the West out of Indochina and HE DID!
