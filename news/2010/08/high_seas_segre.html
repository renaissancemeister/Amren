<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Navy wants to judge sailors by the color of their skin, not the content of their seamanship.</p>
<p>The latest national security leak is a shocking e-mail from a Navy admiral on &#8220;Diversity Accountability.&#8221; The message, sent to a list of other flag officers, notes that &#8220;a change in focus of this year&rsquo;s diversity brief is the desire to identify our key performers (by name) and provide insight on each of them.&#8221; Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead, who apparently originated this order, &#8220;is interested in who are the diverse officers with high potential and what is the plan for their career progression. He may ask what is being done within to ensure they are considered for key follow on billets within the Navy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The message specifies, &#8220;This list must be held very closely but will provide ready reference to ensure we are carefully monitoring and supporting the careers of the best and the brightest the Navy has to offer.&#8221; That is, the best and the brightest provided a sailor is one of the euphemistically &#8220;diverse.&#8221; If you are a white male, it might be time to set sail and seek opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p>In practice, the Navy will be creating a list of privileged &#8220;diverse&#8221; officers who will enjoy special benefits and career mentoring not available to people of the wrong race, as well as a virtual guarantee of fast-track access to the highest reaches of command. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Navy leadership apparently believes the way to promote racial harmony is by engaging in blatant, invidious discrimination. In practice, however, this system will, in fact, relegate &#8220;diverse&#8221; sailors to a form of second-class status. Any nonwhite male sailor who  &mdash;  through intelligence, initiative and drive  &mdash;  builds a stellar career will simply be seen as just another special case, just one of &#8220;the Listers.&#8221; Those sailors may achieve rank, but they will have to work twice as hard to command respect.</p>
<p>{snip} The Naval Academy lists racial diversity as the &#8220;highest personnel priority,&#8221; apparently even over the mission of educating future Navy leaders for warfare on the high seas. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made achieving diversity a &#8220;strategic imperative&#8221; when he was chief of naval operations. {snip}</p>
<p>The suggested list of privileged officers is due Monday. The message states that the reporting requirement will not be put into the secretary of the Navy&rsquo;s TV4 Taskers tracking system &#8220;due to the sensitive nature of the by name list.&#8221; No doubt, once the secret list leaks, as it surely will, there will be as much discomfort for the people on the list as for those not on it, especially those unfortunates who met the diversity requirement but for some reason did not make the cut. {snip}<br>

		<p>An affirmative action nuclear Navy!  Doesn&rsquo;t that make you feel secure.  It is time whites abandoned starting military careers. </p>
<p>Young white men should attend private military academies during the high school years to learn the skills needed to protect themselves and their families when the end comes.  Probably young white women as well.  The end will be ugly.</p>
<p>My brother-in-law is a career Navy man, I can&rsquo;t wait to ask him his opinion on this<br>

		<p>Someone might want to remind Admiral Mullen that the Navy&rsquo;s foremost objective is maintaining its warfighting capability above all else and that promoting officers on the basis of race, ethnicity, or homosexuality is an outrageous affront to the Navy&rsquo;s reason for being.</p>
<p>Doubtless in Mullen&rsquo;s view a black female lesbian skipper of a carrier would represent the ultimate in naval leadership.</p>

<p>And that policy will ensure the deterioration of the Navy since there aren&rsquo;t but a wee few non-whites who could maintain the traditionally high standards of the Navy.  </p>
<p>Just one more reason this country is fact becoming dysgunctional and is destined to collapse, bringing its pitiful empire right down with it.</p>

		<p>I got out of the US Navy in the late 70s. My reason for leaving was that blacks were being advanced ahead of whites. My test scores were much higher on the advancement exam. Several blacks that were given advancement even had criminal history within the Navy. My point being&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..this has been going on for a very long time. So now the leak proves what everyone already knew. </p>

		<p>Sounds like the Navy&rsquo;s top brass, no doubt promoted because of their &#8220;committment to diversity,&#8221; are taking a cue from our top universities, which heavily discriminate against whites   &mdash;  - in particular lower-income whites:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Those of us that have an interest in ancient history will know that the Roman army built all the roads in the known world during the Roman years of greatness hence, the quote &#8220;all roads lead to Rome&#8221; we will also know that the roads were built by the Roman army because Julius Caesar knew, and said, than an Army with nothing to do will get into trouble (paraphrased). Clearly, the same is true of a Navy&hellip;I see the results of this sort of pandering every day here in Afghan and saw it in Iraq too.</p>

		<p>When reflecting on this article, bear in mind that Diversity does NOT equal Affirmative Action. AA means that blacks receive preferential treatment at the expense of white males. Diversity means that white males are punished even if it is damaging to blacks. </p>
<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s the navy made a big push for AA, and many blacks and females benefited. Today Diversity is the U.S. military&rsquo;s obsession. The beneficiaries are the non-black minorities: Hispanic, Indian, &amp; Oriental. Sufficient numbers of these groups are capable of operating all of the FedGov&rsquo;s military assets to render white men unnecessary. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d say-as I have often wanted to-&#8220;why, white men, would you  serve the military?&hellip;it hates you, and so does the society at large.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d especially think this, because those in combat arms-not cooks and truckdrivers- are OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE. Whites die, while the third worlders push boxes and papers around, if that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a very cruel irony to teliing white men not to put their bodies in harms way for a corrupt, worthless, white-hating military and country:<br>
To leave combat arms in the hands of third world incompotents and white-haters, is to allow the &#8220;fifth column&#8221; to dominate, just as the stupid Romans let foreigners take over their military.</p>
<p>Fatally incompotent though the third world fighting force under the sad US banner would be (they&rsquo;d lose every engagement, sink their own ships, crash all their planes, etc.), it would finally bring about the DREAM of all the  effete, flimsy, spineless white Marxists. <br>
For white lefties would  finally have their brown army, ready and frothing to mow down non Marxists whites by the thousands.<br>
We&rsquo;re really in a pickle here, huh?</p>

And I thank minorities of every stripe for theit honorable service. I also know that blacks and browns serve in combat-and het hurt, and die. I salute them.<br>
But let&rsquo;s face it, the military uses whites like kindling.</p>

		<p>Fred, of Fred On Everything, has a smart take on the U.S. Navy., which - in his view - isn&rsquo;t really going to do us much good.  </p>
<p>In short, he thinks the Navy is spending too much, on stuff that won&rsquo;t survive a serious fight, and a result, will never end up in a fight. </p>
<p>That makes the Navy a jobs program for its personnel, and a source of pork barrel profits for military contractors. </p>

		<p>#10 E Pluribus Pluribus makes a great point. This isn&rsquo;t &#8220;whites&#8221; being discriminated against. This is WORKING CLASS whites being discriminated against. After all, it&rsquo;s usually not rich or even middle class whites going into the military. They go to college. The military is where working class folks go. So now the elitists want to stick it to poor whites in the military, too? Has anyone seen Dr. Guillotin lately? There are a couple of admirals in need of his medical services.<br>

		<p>As mentioned, the navy hasn&rsquo;t had a real battle in over fifty years.   Generals fight the last wars and so do admirals, thus we are stuck with large ungodly expensive carrier fleets whose rapidly diminishing utility is configured for glorious combat against Yamamoto. </p>
<p>With no real mission, what&rsquo;s a promotion hungry senior navy officer to do since he can&rsquo;t prove himself in battle?  Become distinguished in the PC wars of course and be the first with puckered lips affixed to the correct posterior. </p>
<p>From information leaked by active duty (real) sailors, huge carriers and other large ships are fast becoming nothing more than floating brothels with all the wymen allowed to serve aboard.  Add this to average black incompetence and affirmative action promotions and one wonders what the real effectiveness of the navy is.   </p>
<p>There are a few islands of competence.  One is the boat service.  It&rsquo;s amazing how white this branch is even today (like the Seals).  Yet wymen now will be allowed to serve on submarines as well.  Insanity never ends.</p>
<p>Serious navy analysts question the usefulness of today&rsquo;s huge floating carrier targets (except as toys).  They grant their value in projecting power quickly abroad, in third world skirmishes.   Yet even these backward countries will soon be able to buy effective countermeasures such as extremely quiet diesel submarines and long range supersonic, sea skimming anti-ship missiles of the Chinese model. <br>
  <br>
It&rsquo;s ironic that as the carriers become floating toys for admirals, the once obsolete battleship may become vogue again for certain narrow missions.  The Marines have for years indicated that they are being starved of serious and cheap shore bombardment capability.  They primarily rely on planes and expensive missiles which could dry up very rapidly in a drawn out conflict.  </p>
<p>One investigative report on aircraft lost in Viet Nam claimed that some 80 percent of the planes shot would have been saved had a couple of battleships been used for those missions instead.  </p>
<p>Reports indicate that the New Jersey was very effective the short time it was on station off Viet Nam.  One wonders why it was suddenly withdrawn. Some say that supposedly the North demanded this before they would talk.  This is probably true but it could be that carrier admirals also didn&rsquo;t want missions stolen that they wanted for their own glory, so effective was the ship.<br>
 <br>
But navy funds go to the big toys and unproven stuff that is a lot sexier and &ldquo;more serious&rdquo;. Rest assured that the affirmative action, quota, and budget games played by the likes of Roughead (a certified fool) will likely be paid in blood by sailors and marines in the future. <br>

		<p>At this point in time it is safe to say that the &#8220;US&#8221; military is the mortal enemy of the Native Born White American majority. The &#8220;US&#8221; navy seems hell-bent on-sometime  in the near future-of making a Muslim &#8220;American&#8221; named Mohammad Islam captain of a nuclear armed nuclear submarine named the &#8220;USS&#8221; Mohammad. Don&rsquo;t laugh&hellip;it will happen as the muslim population in &#8220;America&#8221; continues to grow very rapidly.</p>
<p>So why is this horrific nightmare unfolding right before our very eyes? Well, it is not that all difficult to understand. The late General Smedley Butler-do a wikipedia lookup at least-laid it out over 70 years ago. General Butler stated the obvious:the US military is an enforcer for the &#8220;racket&#8221;. What is the &#8220;racket&#8221; then? The US military is nothing but the muscle bound enforcer -these days- for the two corporate owned Democatic and Republican parties. The &#8220;inviting the world&#8221; immigration policy-the blessings of diversity(post-1965 nonwhite scab labor policy)-is the &#8220;moral&#8221; cover of the very nasty Democratic -Republican parties &#8220;invading the World&#8221; policy.</p>
<p>Get out of the &#8220;invading the World business&#8221; and the &#8220;inviting the nonwhite World&#8221; policy will-correspondingly-come to an end.</p>
<p>The &#8220;US&#8221; military has become a despicable treasonous anti-Native Born White American organization.</p>

		<p>The biggest danger inherent to military services in general and to &#8216;diverse&rsquo; ones in particular is that they are massive labor unions whose peacetime role is largely one of safety valve for the lower inteligence, higher violence, predicated elements of our society.  If you want to know what has become of our &#8216;will to lead&rsquo;, you need look no further than a military system which has alternately butchered and uptaked the largest percentage of our HG biased male population and turned them into &#8216;responsible citizens&rsquo;.  Or corpses.  When civilian job markets could have truly used their point-man effect as aggressive, initiative taking, leaders.<br>
Which is where the &#8216;union&rsquo; part becomes dangerous.  Because you have not heard of 2.5 division &#8216;layoffs&rsquo; from the military as you have from the likes of (50,000 plant workers) GM.  And if you did, you would not like the outcomes.  At the same time, since they are largely useless in peacetime (&#8216;humanitarian/peacekeeping&rsquo; roles and missions could be vastly more efficiently done without the military adjunct requirement), they have to fight hard to sustain themselves based on eliteness and social networking which amounts to &#8216;turf&rsquo; coverage of each other&rsquo;s exclusive interests.<br>
This is also obviously a major driver towards inefficiency but more importantly, it highlights how the military physically DOES NOT live by our laws, Constitutional or otherwise.  And how there training and isolation from our society has led a great many of the to feel a definite sense of superiority.<br>
When you have been defacto brainwashed at a very vulnerable age, it is easy to lose the sense of community without as well as within the military &#8216;family&rsquo; and indeed, when that community does not have the same color of skin, to remind you of your own parents as much as social class, it becomes very easy to bury your identity in the deliberate group think of a chain of command and UCMJ that has little or nothing to do with &#8216;best interests of the United States&rsquo;.  And more to do with supporting the man that feeds you.<br>
Short of a -massive- technology retrograde, we will never again likely face either a Doenitz or Yammamoto, wars simply happen at too high an ops tempo for &#8216;strategy&rsquo; (good or bad) of that sort to apply.  With this in mind, the USN is a terribly backward service and it is sliding towards a precipice of ineptitude very quickly, largely due to ineffective and dated ship designs.  And a failure to acknowledge the multi-environmental (cross-boundary) nature of the fights we now face.  And the distances that they represent.<br>
If you move to a &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; emphasis, you will see even more waste as billets are conserved rather than collapsed and superceded.  And where those billets are ethnic-nonwhite commanded, you can bet that the emphasis will -still be- on &#8216;sustaining the union not The Union&rsquo; by means of high manpower allocations and personal relationships as have long dominated the white navy before.<br>
It&rsquo;s the size which is both the enemy and the purpose of the military in service to this nation.  And the irony is that it is closer to a socialist environment than it is to any democracy.<br>

		<p>Just a couple of my radical ideas for consideration;</p>
<p>Could it be that the government is concerned with the majority of upper military special units such as SEALS being dominated by whites from rural zones of the U.S. that are most often &#8220;Red&#8221; zones and Protestant?  It is possible that the view of a military struggle should Federal breakdown occur would be quickly decided by these elite forces, who are overwhelmingly white?  This could be a combination of AA and Socialism, but also an effort to circumvent a &#8220;too white&#8221; military in the face of states that are beginning to grow restive.</p>
<p>My view of the military in general, except for a very small section of it, those who actually fight and die, is that it is and has been since the &rsquo;60s a growing state within the state.  It is a communist system, and a corrupt one, in uniform.  I have known and seem countless examples of individuals, especially females who join for the welfare benefits the military supplies.  In an uncertain world, and one where males have become less reliable, due to feminism reducing the preferrence for the employment of male family men, single mothers, or those likely to become mothers due to the general social disfunctions that provide this liklihood in young women, the military provides a wonderful alternative where they also get to wear a uniform, get called &#8220;heroes,&#8221; on occassion and even have college paid for should they not be &#8220;lifers.&#8221;  I have met some of these women (and minorities) at the local community college.  They expect to pass no matter how they do academically.  Knowledge is not the point, but sitting through a program is, regardless of actual performance.  This and other AA inspired mechanations are placing a strain on society in general that no amount of positive marketing is going to be able to conceal very much longer.  It is my opinion that this general disfunction is behind the steadily reducing efficacy of government in general.  Both parties as affected just as most Americans are, regardless of their professed politics.  That is how insidious this trend has become.  </p>
<p>The military has become a perverse tool in &#8220;equalizing&#8221; American society.  One personal example I can cite is my nephew who served in the Navy from 1988 to 2002.  He reported that many female seamen were prostituting at sea.  We have seen a few cases of female military personnel gone AWOL because they were being raped, or pressured for sex by superiors.  We have had reports from other AMREN posters on the huge amount of rape taking place in the military by blacks against white females (all females), where many white females have complied due to their fear of official reprimands should they display any form of &#8220;racism.&#8221;  The very strong Marxist element in government has largely succeeded in turning the military into an indoctrination program for social engineering of civilian life.</p>

		<p>This sort of institutionalized incompetance is one thing if the post office is doing it, but completely unforgivable in the armed forces.</p>

		<p>There are 8 men in my family and 7 of us served in the US Navy, 4 in Vietman, 2 in peacetime and 1 in the Persian Gulf. I can&rsquo;t wait to pass this along to them.<br>

		<p>When the US starts to come apart, the Army, Air Force and Marines will split up into single-race factions, which will quickly go to war against one another. Fortunately, all those poorly trained, undisciplined blacks   &mdash;   &#8220;led&#8221; by incompetent AA officers   &mdash;   will be crushed in short order.</p>
<p>The situation will be different in the Navy and Coast Guard. After all, ships and subs are self-contained entities with racially mixed crews; therefore the kind of fracturing noted above would be impossible. Will gangs of black crewmen try to mutiny against white skippers (with white crewmen defending the bridges), and vice versa? Will officers scuttle their ships as a last resort if a successful mutiny appears imminent? Will white-controlled ships open fire on black-controlled ships in the same group? Interesting times ahead, for sure.</p>

		<p>..and to think I have been encouraging my 14 year-old son to consider applying to the Naval Academy when he&rsquo;s older.  Too bad for the Navy.  It&rsquo;s truly their loss.  </p>
