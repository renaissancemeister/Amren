<h1>NYC House Race Boils Down to Wall Street Visions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beth Fouhy, Google News, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s an audacious gamble, even with anti-establishment fever running high: a former hedge fund lawyer trying to unseat a nine-term congresswoman popular in her district.</p>
<p>As political newcomer Reshma Saujani takes on Rep. Carolyn Maloney in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary, voters will face competing visions of financial reform in an era when anger against Wall Street excesses and federal bailouts run deep.</p>
<p>Maloney&rsquo;s liberal, activist record is almost perfectly in sync with her district. But with a compelling biography, impressive fundraising haul and handful of high-profile Democratic connections, Saujani is giving her the strongest challenge she&rsquo;s faced since her first run for the House in 1992.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Saujani, meanwhile, served as an attorney for three hedge funds, including the Fortress Investment Group, for which former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards briefly served as an adviser. Fortress invested heavily in lenders that offered subprime mortgages  &mdash;  higher-priced loans for borrowers considered greater risks. The meltdown of the subprime mortgage industry in 2007 helped fuel the collapse of the housing market.</p>
<p>Saujani&rsquo;s campaign has also raked in Wall Street cash. She has raised nearly $1.2 million so far, an impressive total for a newcomer, with $300,000 coming from the financial services industry alone. Maloney has raised more than $2.5 million for her re-election.</p>
<p>Financiers like Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn have contributed to Saujani&rsquo;s campaign, as have Morgan Stanley board chairman John Mack and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon&rsquo;s wife, Judith Dimon. Her candidacy has also drawn the support of Democratic Party leaders with strong ties to the financial industry, including Cathy Lasry, wife of billionaire hedge fund manager Marc Lasry, and Maureen White, a former Democratic National Committee finance chairwoman and wife of investment banker Steve Rattner, Obama&rsquo;s former auto industry czar.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The daughter of Indian parents who lived in Uganda until 1973, when Idi Amin&rsquo;s regime forced them to flee, Saujani speaks movingly of her mother slipping out of the country with her jewelry hidden in a toothpaste tube. The family settled in Chicago as refugees, and Saujani attended the University of Illinois, Harvard and Yale Law School before moving to New York.</p>
<p>Saujani is unabashedly following the Obama presidential campaign model, even as the president has endorsed the incumbent. Saujani is trying to develop a multicultural coalition of new and younger voters in the district, which covers the east side of Manhattan and part of Queens.</p>

		<p>So her biography isn&rsquo;t the usual one, she&rsquo;s somewhat exotic in that way. But where does she stand on immigration? She&rsquo;s out hustling for big money sponsors so how is she any different from the usual cast of flunkeys for the plutocracy?  </p>

		<p>When Saujani&rsquo;s parents were forced out of Uganda, they did not flee to their Indian homeland.</p>
<p>Rather, they responded to the beckoning arms of the West.  At the time (the mid 1970&rsquo;s) mass Third World immigration was just about to grow from a trickle to a torrent.  </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was there, savouring the prospect of millions of Third World migrants pouring into U.S. cities, causing white flight, ghetto-ization, urban renewal, and the sub-prime mortgage bonanza.</p>
<p>Wall Street has picked a fitting representitive in this orphan Indian.</p>

		<p>During his presidential campaign Obama said to an Indian engineer, &#8220;You are the future!&#8221;  The clearly implied subtext was that we whites are the past.  When politicians get millions from fat cats like Soros and Cohn for being left wing advocates of big government and open borders with a multicultural following, it does appear that whites are on the way out.</p>
<p>This does not mean, of course, that any but a few of the white politicians are any good.  The rest sell us out any chance they get.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We are building a campaign where we really identify people who&rsquo;ve been disenfranchised from the political process  &mdash;  women, minorities, young people, South Asians  &mdash;  and are really bringing them into the process,&#8221; Saujani said.</i></p>
<p>How do the women here feel about always being lumped in with every non-white group around?  As if it did a white women any good to see her husband denied a promotion because of his skin color.</p>

		<p>Here come the South and East Asian politicians.  The past five years have seen a boatload of Indians vying for public office.  This is a direct result of non-Jewish white Americans foregoing higher learning.  Around 80% of Indians in America have college degrees compared with about 30% for non-Jewish white Americans.  This means Indians have much greater connections to rich people to fund their campaigns and educated people to run them.  The situation is only going to get worse because of the education trends, immigration and South and East Asians&rsquo; increasing desire to enter politics.</p>

		<p>Carolyn Maloney is a typical limousine liberal who has always supported open-borders. Now that the Third World masses are here they&rsquo;ve quite naturally decided to replace this &#8220;priviledged white&#8221; with one of their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;As ye sow, so shall ye reap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let the chickens come home to roost!  I&rsquo;m always happy when liberals get a dose of their folly.  Sad thing is, if this new candidate wins, Maloney will probably just tear up with joy and proudly proclaim that the &#8216;new america&rsquo; is here.</p>

		<p>Not only is Carolyn McCarthy, a limousine liberal, as Madison Grant reminds us, she&rsquo;s a gungrabber in the Ted Kennedy-Charles Schumer mold. She was a Long Island housewife, until the day her husband was gunned down on the Long Island Railroad by the deranged Jamaican, Colin Ferguson. Instead of raging against her husband&rsquo;s killer, she foamed at the mouth about guns. She has introduced several bills related to gun-control, all of which have (thankfully) gotten nowhere. There&rsquo;s a video out there, in which, she admits in an interview, she has no idea what certain parts on a gun&rsquo;s function are.</p>
<p>She is bad for the Second Amendment.</p>
