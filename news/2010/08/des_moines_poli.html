<h1>Des Moines Police Say They Can&rsquo;t Confirm Race Was Factor in Fights Near Fairgrounds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Pulliam and Tom Alex, Des Moines Register, August 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Des Moines police investigators are unable to confirm that weekend violence outside the Iowa State Fairgrounds was racially motivated, officials said Wednesday  &mdash;  shifting away from written reports and public statements made by officers after the melee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to jump to conclusions,&#8221; Lt. Joe Gonzalez said. &#8220;It is not the standpoint of the police department right now to say that it&rsquo;s racially motivated. We are following up and continually talking to the victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statements were a change from earlier in the week, when a police official said it was &#8220;very possible&#8221; race was a factor in the incidents.</p>
<p>A report filed by Sgt. Dave Murillo said there were 30 to 40 people roaming the fairgrounds openly referring to &#8220;beat whitey night.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Capt. Randy Dawson said he could not find the origin of information that appeared in Murillo&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>Interviews with victims of attacks outside the fairgrounds have not produced evidence that any of the incidents were racially motivated, he said.</p>
<p>Gonzalez and Dawson said the &#8220;beat whitey night&#8221; information stemmed from &#8220;general intelligence information&#8221; that was unsubstantiated and had been misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Murillo made the report while he was working off-duty at Mercy Medical Center, Dawson said. It was unclear who told Murillo that people roaming the fairgrounds were making those kinds of statements.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been looking into that, and I cannot find the origin of that comment,&#8221; Dawson said.</p>
<p>Police do not believe the attacks were orchestrated, Dawson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say it was random.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There&rsquo;s no indication there was a plan to make this kind of disruption,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abdul-Samad [Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad, D-Des Moines], who has worked to fight gang-related violence, told The Des Moines Register this week that factors other than race, such as nonracial taunting, might have been involved in the clashes that occurred near the fairgrounds.<br>

		<p>And I&rsquo;m just ever so certain that the wise police would apply equally stringent standards of evidence to any <i>Whites</i> charged with a &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;  After all, blacks <i>cannot</i> commit Hate Crimes, right?</p>

		<p>It was blacks beating up whites.  As has been and will be noted if the races were reversed there wouldn&rsquo;t need to be anything more than that for it to be deemed racially motivated.  I&rsquo;ll also put money that the &#8220;general intelligence&#8221; was right and that hoardes of thug blacks were going around saying it was beat whitey night as they beat their vitims.  Regardless, the whites who were there and most of the whites reading about it or hearing about it know exactly what it was and the smart ones will take precautions.</p>

		<p>Whew, things are looking surreal there. Government stooges are spinning it as hard as they can. Gang attacks are now described as fights or melees, implying equal guilt. Dawson doesn&rsquo;t believe it was orchestrated? This person is in law enforcement? He&rsquo;s never heard of &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; or &#8220;wilding&#8221;, dispersed thugs coordinated via cell phone? It goes on all over the country. No, these officials are trying to play all this down, they can&rsquo;t be that incompetent. By the way, most of these criminals probably came to Iowa from Chicago. For some reason they&rsquo;ve shipped plenty of them out there, most likely because section eight apartments were easier to get, as well as no hassle welfare. All 100% welfare though, not a worker in the bunch.     </p>

<p>How many Hispanics are there in Des Moines, I wonder?  Surely not many. So far, most of the people who have been quoted on this story, or any way involved, have been black or Hispanic, nearly all. Are these ranking officers (not ordinary cops, mind you) Affirmative Action promotees?   I&rsquo;m willing to  bet it.</p>
<p>And Captain Randy Dawson, if he&rsquo;s white, is safegarding his next promotion. It&rsquo;s quite likely that a politician like  Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad will have some input into that. Police captains have to play politics and they know where their bread is buttered. </p>

		<p>I read this story and then I read a story about Ahmed H. Sharif, the cab driver who was stabbed by Michael Enright, a white man, after being asked if he was a Muslim. The difference is that the stabbing was immediately labeled as a hate crime. Is that because Mr. Enright is white? I think yes!</p>

<p>Altercation, confrontation, tension, disagreement, these terms also mask crime against whites. </p>

		<p>Notice the word selection of the leftist scum media.  Group racial assaults in which mobs of blacks attack, beat, stab and stomp lone white victims are called &#8220;fights&#8221;.  Reverse the races of the involved parties and the media would call them &#8220;brutal racist assaults.&#8221; Police departments are no better than the media as covering up, denying, or ignoring black crime against whites is the status quo.  </p>

When I read the first article, I was surprised how quickly (though tentatively), the police labeled it a &#8216;possible&rsquo; hate crime.</p>

		<p>The simple way to assert control over a portion of the nation is on a state by state approach.  In a state such as Iowa you need to elect and presure politicians into:</p>
<p>1) Classifying attacks on whites by non-whites as a hate crime.  If they dilly-dally vote them out.<br>
2) Three strikes and your out laws.  Any felony committed on or after the age of 14 count as adult crimes.  Third strikes equals life in prison.<br>
3) Public executions for murder.<br>
4) Refusal to particpate in matching funds prgrams like section 8, TANF, Medicaid and Food Stamps.  Take care of your state&rsquo;s elderly and truly disabled citizens out of state funds only.  Everyone else works or is homeless.  Matching federal funds COST in the long run.<br>
5) Tough anti-illegal immigrant laws AND enforcement of those laws.<br>
6) Ban affirmative action and make it very difficult to sue for discrimnation.<br>
7) Jail time for failure to support your illegitimate children.</p>
<p>Making life too tough for the criminal and welfare elements means they will move on to greener pastures over time.  As the number of tax consumers drops and tax payers increase a states economy will improve as will it&rsquo;s population.  You&rsquo;ll end up with a whiter, brighter population.</p>

<p>Once again, I&rsquo;ll bet if you were to ask the victims if the attacks were racially motivated that a lot of them would say &#8220;yes&#8221;. The trick is when he says &#8220;have not produced evidence&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is political spin job. I&rsquo;ll bet the police have put their officers on &#8220;lockdown&#8221; and threatened any of them who deviates from the party line.</p>

		<p>   By the late 1970&rsquo;s &#8220;fairgrounds&#8221; in the south had become place  for perpetual  black crime.  Same old story for the past 40 years.  White people need to stay away from frivolous entertainment and commit themselves to what is important.  Your survival is at stake.  Leave them be and they will turn on one another.  The old has passed away.  Don&rsquo;t think it will be given back to you whether at your universities or your playgrounds.  And don&rsquo;t look for police departments to take a stand for what is right.  They are subservient to politicians who pose and pander.  sbuffalonative got it right.  &#8221; Someone got to these people and made them retract their original comments.&#8221;  These &#8220;someones&#8221; are never going to take your side.  EVER.  Don&rsquo;t look for it.  </p>

<p>You mean like &#8220;Abdul-Samad [Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad, D-Des Moines&#8221; THAT someone! probably a black muslim convert too, just as despicable as a real Saudi muslim. Wonder if he converted AFTER being elected, seems odd that the people of White bread Iowa would elect a muslim black to the senate or whatever, but then all the police mentioned have ILLEGAL ALIEN names too!</p>

<p>Of course they would say that.  That&rsquo;s their mentally challenged way of concluding they are doing their part to reduce racial tensions, since whites are in the majority and any white response would be devastating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the BIG LIE white spineless police use all over the country, thinking it will enhance their careers if they keep whitey down, encouraged to do so by the corrupt politicians who want to hold on to their power and assure their pensions will be intact when they get through screwing up the country, just as the corporate greed mongers want to assure they don&rsquo;t lose any money because of racial clashes.</p>
<p>What the fools are too dense to understand is that a growing number of meek little whites are building a rage and are near the point where they&rsquo;re beginning to growl a bit and it&rsquo;s looking as if they just might bite back, if this situation continues unabated.</p>
<p>Times are beginning to get hard, and hard times make hard people.</p>
<p>The one great problem they cause in lying about the situations is that it encourages blacks to continue their attacks, knowing they won&rsquo;t be held accountable for their abject racism against whites.</p>
<p>But as long as pensions, power and money continue on these self-appointed elites don&rsquo;t care one bit about the average white in their communities who fell the brunt of black on white racist violence. <br>

		<p>In my job in law enforcement, I weekly see black organized parties get out of hand and hundreds show up where they were not invited. It is all done by texting/cell phones.  No doubt in my mind that &#8216;beat whitey night&rsquo; got it&rsquo;s start in precisely the same place. Black violence on whites is almost always a numbers game. Alone they are cowards, but in packs they will take on alone/outnumbered whites.  </p>
<p>Additionally, Iowa whites are some of the most clueless about  dealing with blacks. These are the same whites who thought voting Obama would be a good idea in the primaries. Perhaps between the two, some racially aware eyes have been opened. </p>

		<p>This is unadulterated malarkey that the police are not sure this was racially motivated violence against whites. Hordes of black gangsters attacking whites while letting non-whites go in piece, attacking them in large groups with knives and brass knuckles and yelling &#8220;It&rsquo;s beat whitey night.&#8221; is proof positive that racial terrorism was their intent. It&rsquo;s amazing nobody was killed by these gang bangers, let alone gang bangers getting shot between the eyes by a white defending himself and his family from death or bodily harm. When whites cannot go to a fair in peace, widespread and organized violence against us on the part of black and Hispanic gangs, thugs and terrorists is a near certainly in the coming months. Whites better arm themselves and learn combat skills to make these thugs pay in blood, pain and death when they attack people who just want to live in peace.</p>

		<p>Happens in England all the time. We even have a sainted black victim, the late &#8216;Stephen Lawrence&#8216;&#8220;murdered by a gang of racists in Eltham.&#8221; Even though there is no evidence  he was murdered by whites or any gang other than through the statement given by his fellow  black friend (Dwaine Broooks - a rather unsavioury character who  not only ran away  from the alleged racial incident that led to the murder that night, but  later tried to claim compensation from the Met police  for racial discrimination). Ever since the so called &#8216;Eltham Five&rsquo; were cleared  of the murder the media have hounded them incessantly, right down to  allowing a black officer of the law and member of the Black Police Officers Association to fit one of the boys  up on a racial abuse charge. Leroy Logan of the BPOA alleged  one of the said boys had abused him  as he was driving past in his car one afternoon. No proof - no witnesses - but the boy was imprisoned. After Blair Peach (an anti racist activist allegedly murdered by police  at a National Front  march in 1976, Southall, London) Stephen Lawrence is probably the most famous &#8216;race murder&rsquo; in Britain. So much so that the Guardian actually has a Stephen Lawrence section and likens his victimhood to that of Anne Frank.  </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that this is because police watch the same news and TV shows that we do and have to undergo sensitivity or racial awareness training. And have to answer to liberal and race based special interest groups. It all seems based on the idea of the evil racist white boogeyman caricature. Everyone knows Real crimes are committed by whites. And the more prisons are filled with black robbers and killers and drug users. . the more we must be told blacks are victims of racism and racial violence. The conditioning we receive flies completely in the face of real crime statistics. Reality and rhetoric could not possibly be more different. And blacks are actually much more likely to get away with crime in the first place. So the crime rate and incarceration rates don&rsquo;t match up. Blacks are underrepresented in prison compared to the crimes they commit. Excuse me, the black &#8216;victims&rsquo; in prison are underrepresented. </p>

		<p>I believe that it was Iowa that proposed a program back in the mid 90s to import blacks from Detroit and other ghetto cities to enhance diversity. </p>
<p>If this actually happened, then Iowans are getting their just rewards for such stupidity. If it didn&rsquo;t, just the proposal of such foolishness indicates an insanity that is difficult to believe. </p>
<p>Iowans also started the ball rolling in the primaries for the Kenyan now acting as president. Of course that state went for him in the general election as well. </p>
<p>Iowans, like New Englanders who have had bitter experiences with their pet Somalis, will learn nothing from this &#8220;state fair&#8221; unpleasantness.  </p>
<p>Most likely dumb Iowa whites will figure they had the beatings coming to them as punishment for imagined crimes against blacks. White parents will be even more willing now to hand over their daughters to blacks in an effort to show how they are overcoming racist feelings.  </p>
<p>Their offerings will culminate in great eruptions of morally orgasmic euphoria. &#8220;Of course I&rsquo;m not racist. My daughter is married to a fine outstanding African American man.  You should see our beautiful mixed grand children etc, etc.&#8221;  Secretly after saying such trivia they&rsquo;ll likely go the bathroom and vomit their toenails out. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know if Iowa is a conceal carry state but it looks like it should be if it is not. Forget protection from the law white man, you&rsquo;re on your own.  <br>

		<p>This WAS ABSOLUTELY a racially-motivated attack on Whites by Des Moines Blacks - Section 8ers largely imported from Chicago and the like.</p>
<p>Des Moines radio station WHO had a host - Jan Mickelson - who interviewed eyewitnesses the day after while the Des Moines Register tried to backpedal from the reality of it. The radio interviews are still posted for your listening.</p>
<p>Go ahead, listen. Then try to tell yourself and your lying ears that this was NOT a racially-motivated incident.<br>

		<p>The hypocrisy and double standard of what is considered racial hatred and discrimination and what is not is mid boggling.</p>
<p>What happened to the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; doctrine invented by the Supreme Court in the 1970ties? If blacks fail tests and admission standards more than other racial groups it&rsquo;s automatically considered racial discrimination, but when these are whites that are beaten up and blacks that do all the beating then the authorities see no evil, hear no evil.</p>
<p>And when Sheriff Arpaio arrests mostly Mexicans for illegal presence in AZ but not Danes, or when AZ new law cannot ascertain that for every illegal Mexican delivered to ICE for deportation there will be a Swedish illegal apprehended, too, then the DoJ presumes it&rsquo;s racism.</p>
<p>This is insulting. Do they think that we are stupid enough to not see trough this deception?</p>
<p>The bottom line here is that the ruling elite is hostile to the white majority. I wonder how long are we going to tolerate that?<br>

		<p> Racial violence? Certainly not here! I don&rsquo;t know who in this agency said that, but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t with our permission, and I can assure you that there&rsquo;s nothing to it. Just some kids scuffling. It happens at all state and county fairs.

		<p>As to why Blacks are being moved to Iowa  &mdash;  I think the Democrats need more voters. There are a number of things that I have seen which make it appear that the Democrats move minority groups around like trading cards.  I think they actually make deals between municipalities.  Chicago has millions of Blacks so they share with Iowa since Iowa doesn&rsquo;t have as many Democrats as Illinois.  Low income minorities can be easily encouraged to move through welfare services such as section 8. I have heard the term &#8220;welfare magnet&#8221; used in this regard. Did you see that big mob of people in Atlanta waiting for section 8 housing?  Some even came from out of state.  What was that all about?  Section 8 has been around for many years so why was there such a rush to get section 8 apartments.  I think what is going on in Atlanta is that many Whites have been moving in to Atlanta, a White woman candidate challenged the Black mayor so I believe that the Black political organization is trying to encourage more blacks to move in so there will be more Black Democrat voters who will vote for them.        <br>
                                                    <br>
States need to drop out of section 8 and all the federal welfare programs.  If you take federal money for welfare programs you will have to play by the rules of the Democrat controlled welfare bureaucracies.</p>

		<p>I stopped going to the fair a long time ago. The Alameda County fair here in CA. had a shooting several years back. Some gangster thug shot some man for his giant stuffed Tweety Bird. He took a life for a damn stuffed doll! This is the element that is out there and why Californians need to have CCW&rsquo;s!! But the ruling elite won&rsquo;t allow it.

		<p>Regrettably, Iowans have so little experience with blacks that they are incredibly naive with respect to just how extremely behaviorally primitive blacks are. They are prone to believe that blacks have the same sort of civilization as White people do, something that simply is not true. I live in Iowa, and I see this in action every day.</p>

<p>Likely not as severely.  With Juan McNasty there probably would have been an AG more willing to prosecute black crime perpetrated against whites.  Not the case with Eric &#8220;the terrorist loving&#8221; Holder as was clearly demonstrated in the voter intimidation case in Penn.  </p>
<p>Note that the Bush appointees wanted to prosecute this case but the Kenyan appointees did not. Even under the hapless Bush Whacker you didn&rsquo;t see blacks get away with this level of open and advertised violence against whites.  With the election of a proud African, the rules have changed and blacks feel more free to get revenge on whitey.  Holder will look the other way. This is essentially a local issue, but if these cases were prosecuted as hate crimes, the DOJ would be watching and ready for any chance to jump in and save the &#8220;brothers&#8221;. </p>
<p>But the bigger point is that naive white Iowans gave this racist Kenyan an early start out of the blocks. Iowans wanted to go to Starbucks and sip their six dollar hot water and brag about how they voted for a fine black man and feel good about being morally superior than, say, those rednecks down south. They didn&rsquo;t think beyond that.  </p>
<p>Without an Iowa win by the Kenyan, Clinton (gag) would likely be Pres.  But at least she&rsquo;s white, I think.       </p>

		<p>As a former inner-city teacher, I can tell you that blacks have been emboldened by the election and the actions of BHO because of his race. They feel more free to harass or otherwise hurt whites, and it is my opinion that they would not have been this emboldened had white person been elected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Des Moines Police Say They Can&rsquo;t Confirm Race Was Factor in Fights Near Fairgrounds&#8221;    [quote]</p>
<p><br>
Notice the delicate, cautious wording here! This headline  sounds like a release vetted by a lawyer or public relations professional. (Which no doubt it was.)<br>
 <br>
They&rsquo;re not saying that race was NOT a factor. They&rsquo;re being very careful about that.  They&rsquo;re just saying they &#8220;can&rsquo;t confirm&#8221; that it was a factor.  So then, it MIGHT have been a factor. And probably even it WAS!  They just can&rsquo;t satisfactorily CONFIRM it.</p>
<p>Ah, legalese!</p>
<p>So this hinges on what they require for confirmation   &mdash;   tape recordings, photographs, or what?   &mdash;   which is left conveniently unexplained. </p>
<p>Are eye witnesses considered just &#8220;hearsay&#8221;?   Are victims considered &#8220;emotional&#8221; or &#8220;confused&#8221;?  Are bystanders &#8220;biased&#8221; or &#8220;unreliable&#8221;?  How many witnesses do they require?   Just what do they need for confirmation?  </p>
<p>Police, given lawyers&rsquo; advice,  could fudge like this forever. They&rsquo;re not lying about anything. They&rsquo;re not even denying anything. They just can&rsquo;t &#8220;confirm&#8221; it.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that if this were a case of whites attacking blacks, the story would be considered &#8220;confirmed&#8221; even before the victim had finished telling his story   &mdash;   before he had gotten it out of his mouth.  But that&rsquo;s another thing, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
