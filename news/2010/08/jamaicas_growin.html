			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Millman, Wall Street Journal, August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two elderly pensioners in this mountaintop village joined hundreds of Jamaicans with a grisly fate: expatriates who spent their working lives abroad, then moved home only to be killed.</p>
<p>Jamaica has the highest homicide rate in the hemisphere, and retired returnees from all over the globe are feeling targeted. WSJ&rsquo;s Joel Millman reports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This verdant island has one of the higher homicide rates in the world with 62 murders per 100,000 residents in 2009. Rising violence is an issue throughout the Caribbean, largely fueled by narcotics trafficking, according to a 2007 joint report by the United Nations and the World Bank.</p>
<p>Jamaican criminals sometimes target returnees, waiting until their monthly pension checks arrive from abroad before striking. One of the gangs preying on the returnees was led by police officers.</p>
<p>The number of returning retirees  &mdash;  1,170 last year  &mdash;  has dropped in half since the 1990s. That&rsquo;s a big deal in Jamaica, which counts on retirees and their money to help pump up its troubled economy.</p>
<p>Some 2 million Jamaicans live abroad, nearly as many as the 2.7 million who live on the island. Their exodus began in 1946 and continues today.</p>
<p>The Jamaican diaspora stretches from North American cities such as Miami, New York and Toronto to big British cities like London, Manchester and Birmingham. Many of the hundreds of thousands of Jamaicans living abroad long planned to stretch their modest pensions by moving back to their much cheaper native country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition, crime hasn&rsquo;t stopped the growth of Jamaica&rsquo;s tourism industry, which generated over $1.9 billion last year, and is on track to surpass that this year.</p>
<p>Still, crime news is widely disseminated among expats, and it causes many U.S. Jamaicans to rethink their retirement plans, says Robert DeSouza, a Jamaican immigrant whose Trans-Continental Express Shippers of Queens, N.Y., specializes in moving Jamaicans. He handles about 50 moves to Jamaica a year, he says, down from over 200 a year in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The robbers are &#8220;targeting returned residents,&#8221; Mr. DeSouza says. He says he knows of two elderly couples who moved home to Jamaica then fled back, one to Georgia and one to Florida.</p>
<p>Many expat retirees, however, say they don&rsquo;t have the money to move back to the U.S. or U.K. Unable to sell in a depressed local market, they instead endure a kind of silent captivity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another potential threat to returnees: their own families. Distant cousins, barely known to retirees, sometimes see returned residents as bank accounts to tap. Ethlyn Hyman-Dixon, a 69-year-old returnee from England, was stabbed to death in 2008 by a nephew who was convicted of the slaying last year.</p>
<p>Boxer Trevor Berbick, the last man to beat Muhammad Ali in the ring, was hacked to death in Portland Parish by a nephew, later convicted of the murder. Mr. Berbick was 54.</p>
<p>Crime has hit a retirement community called Southaven in the town of Yallahs, about 15 miles east of Kingston, that caters to returned expats. With its broad boulevards and white-washed stucco walls, Southaven could be any seniors&rsquo; district in Arizona or Florida  &mdash;  except that many homes are abandoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are scared. They&rsquo;re leaving,&#8221; says Cynthia Edwards, 71, who bought a place in Yallahs with her husband in 2005. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Returnees say they often are targeted by squatters. Last year Jamaica&rsquo;s Ministry of Water and Housing formed a special anti-squatters unit to deal with the estimated 600,000 Jamaicans living on land where they have no legal right. However, unit leader Basil Forsythe says he is only allowed to go after squatters living on public lands. Elderly returning residents, he says, &#8220;have to go through courts on their own. I advise them to engage a lawyer.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jamaica tracks statistics on its returnees, who get generous breaks on customs duties and other fees when repatriating household goods and cars.</p>
<p>Back in 1994, almost 2,600 retired Jamaicans returned to their country. The number of returnees dropped more than half by the early 2000s. It has remained relatively flat every since, even though the number of Jamaicans at retirement age abroad has risen substantially. Just in the U.S., almost 200,000 Jamaican immigrants are now over the age of 60, up from 82,000 Jamaican immigrants who either were retired or were approaching retirement 10 years ago.</p>
<p>For decades, Jamaican governments have counted on money from expats working in England or North America. Eighty percent of the country&rsquo;s college graduates work abroad, according to a World Bank study.</p>

		<p>I bet just like most of those who vacation to Jamaica are American or British blacks, most of those who retire to Jamaica are American or British blacks.  They somehow get it in their heads that Jamaica is a black-run paradise, and then find out differently when they get there.  The part about relatives of returning expats sticking their hands out is the touch that gave it away.</p>

		<p> I know a number of Jamaicans, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans here in New York who tell me they&rsquo;re going to move back to their home countries upon retirement and live like kings on their US pensions.</p>
<p>Of course this is the downside: looking like a bigshot while surrounded by Third Worlders makes you a candidate for robbery or worse.</p>

		<p>This dovetails with one of my revelations and I don`t think it is strictly a Jamacian problem.  I was recently having a free Motel breakfast in what could be described as a &#8220;podunk&#8221; town. <br/>
 An older man about sixty-five was walking around each table and asking the travellers what brought them to this neck of the woods. He would actually hold his cereal moving from table to table hoping to inject himself into someones conversation. We thought it was cute as well as annoying until my little voice spoke to me. &#8220;He`s over sixty-five and broke, he wants to get out of Dodge as bad as we do and he just positioned himself next to my wife`s purse!&#8221;  I quietly took control of the purse no problem. When I got home my wife was enraged that I could be &#8220;So suspicious!!!&rsquo; <br/>
  The next night on the news was an in depth story about the new group victimizing the elderly which  was in fact, the elderly! They are already inside the circle of trust age wise, and to make a long story short those that didn`t save on retirement are now preying on those that did.. They are also ransacking their children`s accounts to keep up the meidication routine.<br/>
 I didn`t get an apology from the spouse just a grunt but I patted myself on the back for thinking like I was still in Rio.</p>

		<p>All Africans, whether they still live in Africa or elsewhere in the world, know that the only safe place to be is in a predominately White community.  They will do anything to get away from other Africans and into a White community or nation   &mdash;   they will crowd onto leaky boats, hide in airplane wheel wells, or pack themselves into shipping crates.  Some have even attempted to mail themselves inside suitcases.</p>
<p>Once safely among Whites, they spend the rest of their lives complaining about racism. </p>

		<p>If these thugs were smart, they would just shake them down for some money, instead of killing them. Once the retires are dead, no more checks coming in. Talk about killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Of course these type of people don&rsquo;t think  ahead or plan for the future. It&rsquo;s all  about them and the moment.</p>

		<p>largely fueled by narcotics trafficking</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only part of the article that is relevant (or different from the way things have been for thousands of years with this population).</p>
<p>That sentence SHOULD read, &#8220;largely fueled by welfare money, from the western world, especially the US, diverted into narcotics trafficking&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is only ONE cause for all the problems non-whites are inflicting upon the world&hellip;&hellip;welfare.  MOST welfare is used by non-whites to buy drugs.  Also, very little of the money that goes to buy the drugs non-whites use, comes from anyplace else (like a job).</p>
<p>The welfare/drug trafficking connection is the very method by which the non-white world attaches to the white world.  Whites create a producer/consumer world economy by which they produce almost every single thing of benefit to man, and fairly distribute these for consumption along the lines describe by the Austrian economists.  Non-whites do not participate in this except to the extent that they produce and consume almost all of the narcotics in the world.  Obviously, this is not a sustainable system&hellip;.so it attaches itself, tick like to the white world via welfare.</p>
<p>Before welfare, there were hardly any non-whites in the white world.  The two worlds were segregated.  There were also few non-whites&hellip;.as population growth requires the system we built and maintain&hellip;.and they do not/will not/can not.</p>
<p>Non-whites have grown to the exact ratio that whites redistribute wealth to them.  And the world they create is a horror.  That horror, mostly unknown in the white world, until the last generation, has come with them.</p>
<p>And they come for only one reason&hellip;..the welfare dollar as distributed into drug trafficking.</p>
<p>The solution is simple and direct.  And would rapidly reverse most of the damage they have caused in the last 60 years.  End welfare&hellip;&hellip;at least to non-whites. Either end all nation giving or restrict it to whites only.  It is the lynchpin upon which all the problems the white world has with non-whites rests.  If welfare ended tomorrow, by the next year, hardly a single Mexican would live in the US and few to no blacks would live anywhere that whites live.  Segregation would de facto return to what it was before the 1950&rsquo;s.<br/>

		<p>Blacks have a high murder rate wherever they live.  This is because they are closer in time than are whites and Orientals to a culture where the best hunters and warriors had the most wives.  In other words, the best killers had the most children, who inherited the desire and ability to kill.<br/>
 <br/>
Civilization selects for superior intelligence, rather than facility in killing, because intelligent men become successful merchants, artisans, artists, government officials, and so on.  <br/>
 <br/>
Hispanics are a hybrid race of Caucasians and American Indians.  This is why they tend to be more dangerous than whites, but less so than blacks. Their academic performance also tends to be between that of whites and blacks, and for the same reason.    </p>

		<p>#6 Anonymous, I must disagree that ending welfare for non-whites would drive them into segregation.  Who would underclass blacks, for instance, work for or steal from?  These people have always found most of their employment opportunities in the white community.  There wouldn&rsquo;t be enough prosperous blacks to hire all such folks for menial work, and there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough capital among blacks for criminals to get by robbing or burglarizing them.  Even during Apartheid in SA, blacks worked in huge numbers for whites.  Welfare is carried out largely to keep the underclass under control, not for any reasons of altruism.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Returnees say they often are targeted by squatters. Last year Jamaica&rsquo;s Ministry of Water and Housing formed a special anti-squatters unit to deal with the estimated 600,000 Jamaicans living on land where they have no legal right.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br/>
600,000 squatters in a pop&rsquo;n of only 2.7 million is an astounding statistic. That means nearly ONE IN FOUR Jamaicans is living in a place they neither own nor pay rent on, but merely &#8220;occupy.&#8221; In other words, &#8220;homeless.&#8221; </p>
<p>So Jamaica is a nation where almost one-quarter of the people are, for all intents and purposes, hobos and/or criminals. That alone is enough to keep the local economy shackled to Third World levels for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>And this is NOT a problem that ANY white country has ANY responsibility to address. Like Haiti, Jamaica should be isolated and ignored. We should spend ZERO tourist dollars there; we should give them ZERO international aid; and we should accept ZERO of their emigrants. Just leave these islands alone until they overpopulate to the point that they capsize and overturn under all the weight. </p>

		<p>@6,</p>
<p>If you think that narco trafficking isn&rsquo;t an -entirely- white regulated activity, which could easily be shut down in it&rsquo;s entirety -but for- the desire of rich whites to get richer off of hurting the poor and stupid of all cultures; you are entirely too innocent for your own good.</p>
<p>Similarly, while you&rsquo;re system (for ending welfare) might work in areas where there was a large percentage of whites who were trained by war and armed by heritage, as they were in the 1950s, did you turn off the tap for welfare tomorrow, those who saw freedom from work in an anonymous check would suddenly see the same opportunity in a wandering white minding their own business.</p>
<p>To be sure, no population which forms only 12% of the total could ever completely dominate a society which still had &#8216;representative&rsquo; (60-70% white) police forces.  But you start to throw in Hispanic and _gang specific_ (armed to the teeth and also trained) culturalization and the odds flip again.</p>
<p>The day that welfare ends will be the day that Devil Nights run 24:7:365 in places like Detroit, Atlanta, NOLA and other high minority leveraged, &#8216;diverse&rsquo;, cities.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t know it for sure, I suspect you also underestimate the effect of white trash criminality in the absence of a sustainment subsidy.</p>
<p>&gt;<br/>
The number stated that receive any portion of their support from from welfare assistance  &mdash;  including food stamps  &mdash;  it is 29,900,000 or roughly 8% of the total population in the United States. </p>
<p>This breaks down to: </p>
<p>39% white 11,661,000 of 29,900,000 recipients </p>
<p>38% black 11,362,000 of 29,900,000 </p>
<p>17% Hispanic 5,083,000 of 29,900,000 <br/>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_percentage_of_people_in_us_are_on_welfare" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_percentage_of_people_in_us_are_on_welfare</a></p>
<p>IMO, what you are seeing is the logical dissonance of instinct from submission.  Those who could be great HG but have low organizational or group association qualities live forever in conflict, both with themselves and with the greater societal perception of shame in their &#8216;lack of effort&rsquo; at accepting a misery of existence.</p>
<p>Since an increasing number of people are either unfit or unwilling to do the &#8216;kinds of jobs available&rsquo; (and don&rsquo;t call them honorable work if you won&rsquo;t do them to spread the load), the reality MUST BE that we:</p>
<p>A.  Look at the genetics that inhibit intelligence and group conformity in a world that no longer needs large scale warrior or HG personality types yet which is still a few ticks on the evolutionary clock away from the period when those skills were essential.</p>
<p>B.  Look at replacement labor that can sustain society without contributing to the ponzi scheme of high birthrate, high consumerism, low contributory value based &#8216;social security and welfare&rsquo; tax contributors.</p>
<p>The latter is itself the largest contributor to the OUTRIGHT LIE of a &#8216;growth economics&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What we need are slaves.  Metal ones.  Ones which are paid literally nothing but parts and electricity.  Ones whose entire _work product_ can be attributed to those who will trade reproductive access for a life of comfort without shame.  A labor force that replaces biological ditch digging with something that never grows old, never acts out, never -knows- what it is missing.</p>
<p>Only then will we be able to concentrate on just living in a way that reflects the cultural values we try to espouse as charitable in our own rights.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no other way forward from here but that we begin shifting to non-animate labor, quickly.  It is a shame beyond words that the Japanese can see so clearly what we hide behind a mask of guilt (forcing people to do jobs we won&rsquo;t and then paying them low wages) and exploitation.</p>
<p>Smart societies are innovators.  Doing more with less.  If you want to sustain that image for America, stop gloating over the genetic or social inequities between races and DO SOMETHING about the underlying technology and medical baselines that make our situation what it is.</p>

		<p>If welfare is cut, then criminality will explode and society will be hurt.<br/>
The longterm solution would be to focus on a reasonable &#8220;socialdarwinistic&#8221; approach. This situation can&rsquo;t continue in which those who even cant take care of themselves, shall have the most children. Make it illegal to have more than one kid while on social security. And if getting kids, let them pay back anything given to them previously by social security.<br/>
Also make parents economically responsible for underage kids, meaning if they destroy anything, the parents must pay. <br/>
Things like this will work silently and slowly. </p>
