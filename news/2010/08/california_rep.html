			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Simon, Los Angeles Times, August 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Even as Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California was warned by a colleague against interceding on behalf of a troubled bank with ties to her husband, her chief of staff, who also is her grandson, was &#8220;actively involved&#8221; in working to help the bank, according to a House Ethics Committee report released Monday that accuses the longtime Los Angeles political figure of three ethics violations.</p>
<p>Around the same time that Waters set up a September 2008 meeting between U.S. Treasury Department officials and representatives of minority-owned banks, her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, sent an e-mail to the staff of Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. According to the report, the subject of the e-mail was: &#8220;O[ne] U[nited] is in trouble.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Three months later, Boston-based OneUnited, with branches in Massachusetts, Florida and Los Angeles County, received $12 million in bailout funds.</p>
<p>If OneUnited had not received the aid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Waters&rsquo; husband&rsquo;s financial interest in the bank would have been worthless, according to the House Ethics Committee&rsquo;s 10-page statement of alleged violations.</p>
<p>The report accuses the 10-term congresswoman of violating three House rules: one that requires its member to &#8220;behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House&#8221;; a second that prohibits lawmakers from using their influence for personal benefit; and a third forbidding the dispensing of favors.</p>
<p>The report referred to Frank&rsquo;s advice to Waters to &#8220;stay out of it&#8221; and refrain from advocating on behalf of OneUnited because of her husband&rsquo;s ties to the institution. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Waters, who has vowed to fight the charges in a trial, has defended her efforts as in keeping with her longtime work to promote opportunity for minority-owned businesses and lending in underserved communities such as her South Los Angeles district.</p>
<p>Documents released by the House Ethics Committee on Monday also offer insight into Waters&rsquo; defense, asserting that the committee has been treating the congresswoman differently than it has treated other lawmakers for similar conduct. The documents also contend that the charges against her run counter to a precedent that &#8220;actions taken by a member that may affect her interests as part of a larger class of shareholders do not violate House rules or ethical standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her attorneys also challenged the assertion that Waters&rsquo; husband benefited from the bailout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further, although the statement of alleged violation notes that the value of Rep. Waters&rsquo; husband&rsquo;s stock was $175,000 in September 2008  &mdash;  before the TARP funding  &mdash;  it fails to acknowledge that the value was unchanged after OneUnited received the TARP funds in December,&#8221; her attorneys argued. &#8220;Thus, if TARP funding neither saved OneUnited nor increased its stock value, this committee cannot establish that Rep. Waters received any financial benefit as a result of her alleged actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waters sought the report&rsquo;s release, saying it would help her clear her name and help her constituents evaluate the case against her. The documents are on the committee website, http://ethics.house.gov.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a joke.  Congressman Waters&rsquo; constituents are illiterate, non-English speaking and largely unaware that this is even going on.  She&rsquo;ll get reelected on her black skin, unless there&rsquo;s alot of illegal aliens voting.  <br>

		<p>When will Ms. Waters come to the AmRen community demanding that we ignore her &#8220;doing the right thing&#8221; when she helped an member of an &#8220;oppressed and marginalized minority&#8221; (hubby)?  </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t we atone for the sins of segregation and hold ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privilege by moving on and rewarding her for helping push America forward by tending to some of its &#8220;unfinished business&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Remarkable how public service can be so financially rewarding. The list of beneficiaries is too long to even get into at this point. The Clinton wedding supposedly cost $3 million. Not quite what the founding fathers envisioned, is it? </p>

<p>Politicians have done an excellent job at blaming the entire financial crisis on the bankers.  But the truth is that politicians had at least as much to do with causing it by creating moral hazards, such as the GSEs that bought up billions of dollars worth of dodgy mortgages.  Here Maxine Waters joins other Democrats, including our pal Barney Frank*, in saying that Fannie Mae is just fine.  Note that at about 5:20 one of the *accomplishments* that Waters credits the GSEs for is &#8220;100% loans&#8221;, that is loans with no down payment.  You, the taxpayer, are now on the hook for the nonpaying mortgages that resulted from such foolish practices:<br>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Waters, who has vowed to fight the charges in a trial&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the charges will be racism, not financial shenanigans. Got It?  Case Closed!  NEXT</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Charges are expected to be announced next week, several Congressional officials said, speaking only on the condition of anonymity because the proceedings remained confidential&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure the officials are speaking &#8216;only on the condition of anonymity&rsquo;, they don&rsquo;t want to be vilified, excoriated and charged with racism in the national media against an &#8216;elderly black woman who&rsquo;s only trying to help her downtrodden people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In June 2005 she co-founded and chaired the Out of Iraq Congressional Caucus (OICC), an entity dedicated to agitating for a swift withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Iraqi theater of war   &mdash;   alleging that the American invasion in 2003 had been launched on a pretext of lies and deliberately manipulated intelligence. Waters&rsquo; fellow OICC co-founders included Lynn Woolsey, John Conyers, Charles Rangel, Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky, William Delahunt, and John R. Lewis&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Think anyone would dare call her on OICC, why she isn&rsquo;t still agitating obama for a &#8216;swift withdrawal&rsquo; from Iraq and Afghanistan?  Think again.  Anyone questioning her hypocrisy  is a racist.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another reason:  U.S. Troop Casualties - 74% Caucasian, 9% African-American, 11% Latino.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;She depicted the retiring moderate Republican Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, as a &#8216;plantation owner.&rsquo; On another occasion, while addressing the allegedly pervasive problem of police brutality against African Americans, Waters said that she had never seen Los Angeles police officers abuse &#8216;little white boys.&rsquo;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Care to challenge her on any of that?  You are a Racist, and a particularly evil one you worthless Kulak!</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;she praised dictator Fidel Castro and wrote that Castro had a perfect right to grant &#8216;political asylum&rsquo; to U.S. citizens fleeing &#8216;political persecution.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2dsz9fl" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2dsz9fl</a></p>
<p>Maybe, she&rsquo;ll consider this latest round of &#8216;false&rsquo;, racist accusations, &#8216;political persecution and &#8216;flee&rsquo; to Cuba.  Nah&hellip;.It&rsquo;s too easy here to bash Whites, accuse her White enemies (= all Whites) of vile racism and rake in cash via threats of accusations of racism.  She&rsquo;s got quite a racket going.</p>
<p>Maxine Waters was born in St. Louis, Missouri  &mdash;  Please take her back!!  I&rsquo;ll personally pay for the shipping costs via the cargo hold of Fed Ex or UPS.  She can be delivered as early as tomorrow.</p>
<p>We Californians have had enough.</p>

		<p>&#8221;* Why does Massachusetts keep inflicting such politicians upon us?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Northeast was inundated by the Cultural Marxist kooks when they fled Europe as Hitler came to power.  Their anti-capitalist, anti-white, tenents were scattered throughout the universities there.</p>
<p>If we go back far enough, we will note that it all began in the thirties.  Columbia University graciously&hellip;and stupidly&hellip;. gave the Frankfort School bunch a safe haven and jobs.  They showed their appreciation by poisoning our system.</p>
<p>The few radicals that embraced it were of the same variety who do so now:  White, usually high middleclass, rebellious types, who disseminated PC university newspapers at first, then expanded to community ones, eventually influencing the public and the larger newspapers who were being constantly stocked with grads from journalism schools who were tutored in the classroom to accept critical theory and all things we know now as political correctness.  </p>
<p>The kookie theories, on their own, couldn&rsquo;t acquire very many  adherents until the introduction of &#8220;love and tolerance,&#8221; right along with their other brand of propaganda.  Of course, the Vietnam war helped it all along especially when many of the Cultural Maxists relocated to California, introducing not only the love and tolerance concepts of their theories, but catch phrases like, &#8220;Make love, not war,&#8221; helped tremendously to gain more support among young minds filled with mush, and that was via the courtesy of Herbert Marcuse. </p>
<p>In short, when their theories didn&rsquo;t take hold, they altered their propaganda to include other more acceptable terms, aimed at the most gullible and naive.  The succes of it all is quite evident today, as we can all see, because their perverted thinking controls the very culture of America, especially the areas where they were most dominant, like Mass., and California.</p>
<p>Nothing will bring about change from this perverted ideology in the world today but total collapse.</p>
<p>So someone up there has taken note of that apparently, because total collapse is what we are going through right now.  Change now is inevitable.  We are witnessing a paradigm shift of huge proportions.  And, though the PC crowd are still in denial they won&rsquo;t be for much longer, and this does not involve years, but mere months.</p>
<p>In essence, with the push for sub-prime loans to the empire&rsquo;s privileged minorities, the PC bunch started the dominoes falling which will inevitably lead to their destruction.</p>
<p>Berkley and Mass. will be too busy fighting for bare survival to care one whit for political correctness.  In fact, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see many of them wearing white sheets, fighting to get their piece of the pie.  It would be the ultimate degradation for them, but it would be well-deserved.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the point of being in Public Office, unless you can steal everything that isn&rsquo;t nailed down? Waters, like Rangle, have done it in spades. I am sure &#8220;Racism&#8221; will be blamed for it, though.</p>

<p>In fact, maybe Maxine should consider going on a shooting rampage to get herself some sympathy.   That seems to be the guaranteed thing lately.  After all, shooting &#8220;racists&#8221; has now become the acceptable thing to do,  when you&rsquo;re caught and  all else seems lost.</p>
