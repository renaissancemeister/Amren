<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Telegraph Herald reported earlier this month that musician and conservative activist Ted Nugent appeared at a show in Dubuque, Iowa, and told the crowd, &#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of white people in this crowd  &mdash;  I like that! (Dubuque) is a white town.&#8221; The Telegraph Herald added that &#8220;Nugent also pointed out at least one audience member and questioned his race.&#8221; The Iowa-based newspaper also slammed Nugent&rsquo;s remarks in an editorial, and noted that Nugent has a history of incendiary remarks.</p>
<p>According to Glenn Beck, Nugent is scheduled to appear at his 8-28 rally, which falls on the anniversary of Martin Luther King&rsquo;s &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech. Beck has repeatedly talked about his rally in civil rights terms, and reclaiming the movement.</p>

		<p>Nugent it seems feels it is ok to acknowledge a positive affirmtion for whites.   This is almost revolutionary in a country, the USA, where it is only politically correct to affirm one&rsquo;s race if it is anything other than white.   In Canada Mr. Nugent would unfortuntely have his career ruined.  I hope he keeps up the good work both musically and politically.</p>

<p>Ted Nugent was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1948; he was 19-years old when the blacks began destroying that city in 1967. He has watched over the decades, as slowly but surely, the &ldquo;dream&rdquo; has vortexed into an unmanageable nightmare of blackness. Besides, who do you think goes to his concerts? I have been to a few of them at the Joe Louis and Cobo arenas in the past, they always look like a little piece of Dubuque dropped into the heart of &ldquo;Mo Town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good for you Mr. Nugent and please don&rsquo;t go into an apology and grovel frenzy, even if the mindless Comrade Beck demands it of you to appear at his &ldquo;reclaiming the movement&rdquo; freak show!</p>

		<p>Hey, it&rsquo;s free speech. So Ted Nugent openly says he likes the fact that Dubuque, Iowa is a white town.</p>
<p>I remember when ex-NBA player Lionel Hollins was traded from Portland to Philadelphia some 25 years ago. He said that he was glad he was going to Philadelphia, because there weren&rsquo;t a lot of black people in Portland. Nobody took him to task on it.</p>
<p>But because Ted Nugent is also an ardent champion of our Second Amendment rights, he gets rebuked.</p>
<p>Keep rocking, Ted.</p>

		<p>Not so sure I care to hear Beck give a presentation, but I would listen to Ted Nugent. It will be interesting to hear what he has to say at the 8-28 rally. Otherwise, it can only be expected that a liberal editorialist would slam any such White-pride type comments. Sadly, now that this is in the news, Dubuque will certainly be targeted for enrichment by the immigration crowd.</p>

<p>The Telegraph Herald fails to provide a direct quote or an explanation of context. The Telegraph Herald would like you to think that Ted stopped the show to demand that an octoroon leave because he didn&rsquo;t satisfy some racial-purity standards.</p>
<p>More than likely, some liberal whiner was fussing about the fact that a White man publicly said that it was nice to be among Whites, and Ted asked what his problem was.</p>

		<p>Okay, who got to Glen Beck and Ann Coulter?  Somebody did.  Suddenly they are for HomoPride, diversity, etc.  Guess it just goes to show you - they are ENTERTAINERS not real conservative activists.  And in the crunch, they will do as their masters say - and we know who those masters are.  Same goes for Fox News in it&rsquo;s entirety, and Rush and all the rest of the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; - who are merely your standard neo-cons with a better script to read from.</p>

		<p>I constantly hear blacks on stage saying &#8220;it&rsquo;s good to see all you black folk here tonight&#8221;, or &#8220;It&rsquo;s always good to be among my brothas and sistas&#8221;. I never hear any outcry about that. As always, a double standard.<br>
Ted doesn&rsquo;t need to grovel to anybody. There was nothing wrong about what he said. When my wife and I go out with friends and the crowd is all White, I ALWAYS make a comment about it like, &#8220;oh my, not a black face in sight, how nice&#8221;, or &#8220;what makes it even better is there&rsquo;s no blacks here to ruin it&#8221;. Nobody ever bats an eye, and will sometimes nod in agreement. Of course I&rsquo;m in the habit of being around like minded Whites. I cut those &#8216;other&rsquo; White people out of my life years ago, the aggravation just wasn&rsquo;t worth it. It even lowered my blood pressure!     </p>

		<p>I think that rather than quipping about if you should invite him to the next AR conference (implying that he is joining one of the despised but enlightened few&hellip;..separate from the unwashed and ignorant &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; masses) you should pay attention to the fact that the truth about race is becoming mainstream.</p>
<p>And prepare for the day soon coming when AR will be a mainstream source of info about such things instead of largely unknown.</p>

		<p>Predictably, the lamestream media is wringing their hands.  It&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable for black New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin to declare that N.O. is a &#8220;chocolate city&#8221; and should remain so, but let a white musician revel in the whiteness of the city he&rsquo;s performing in and it&rsquo;s 1933 all over again, and Nugent is an incarnate of Adolf the painter. </p>
<p>Say Dubuque, IA should remain a vanilla city and that&rsquo;s racism.  Is it any wonder why the days of the libtard dominated media are fast coming to an end? <br>

		<p>Nugent has reached a place professionally, were he can pretty much say whatever he wants without fear of being destroyed financially.  His base of music fans likely share his feelings about Whites and guns and the enemies of both.  As for inviting him to an AR conference, I wouldn&rsquo;t come right out and ask him straight away. Insted, I would send him a DVD of conference Greatest Hits featuring Jared and Sam and the other brother Sam and few few others and see how he reacts.  Let him know he has a lot of fans among us and give him a chance to ease in, so to speak.  I&rsquo;m a little afraid he might scare off if approached too quickly, ala Michael Savage.  I would love to know what was going on in Savage&rsquo;s head when he rejected our overture in such a nasty tone.  Then again, Savage savaged Pat Buchanan too for no justifiable reason, but I still listen to him.  The point is some people have to be brought to our higher level of racial consciousness slower than others.  I hope the Nuge can be shepherded into our fold.  He would be a great asset.</p>

		<p>No, Ted Nugent should NOT be solicited or invited to the Amren conference. Ted Nugent was arrested and convicted a couple of days ago for ILLEGALLY BAITING and killing an UNDERAGED MALE DEER. Oh I can hear some saying &#8220;no big deal&#8221;. It gets better, he had the incident filmed and the aired it on his REALITY TV HUNTING SHOW!</p>
<p>Criminal activity, the abuse of wildlife, having a film crew catch it on tape and then gleefully present with his full knowledge it on a reality tv show for the wildlife officials to see (that is how they caught him) is not something that represents the represents Amrens core values.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Come along if you care.  Come along if you dare!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Like Ted Nugent, I am a hunter; just not as big-game as he is.  While I haven&rsquo;t always agreed with some of his more outrageous remarks about animals; I&rsquo;ve always admired his stance against the Linda McCartneys and other animal-rights nutcases of the celebrity world.  He has showed nothing but guts and he calls them as he sees them.  He&rsquo;s pretty much their worst nightmare because they know they can&rsquo;t con him.</p>
<p>His remarks in Iowa might well be a challenge to the controlled media who not only provide the platform for the high-profile vegetarians; but also push the racist double standards that allow Blacks and other non-Whites to make identical statements with impunity.</p>
<p>Stick to your guns, Ted&hellip;.not that you&rsquo;ve ever needed reminding of that anyway.</p>
<p>I must now consult my music files and take a &#8216;Journey to the Center of the Mind&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>I dunno about that Beck character. He says some pretty harshly liberal things when it comes to racial matters. For example, a couple of nights ago on the O&rsquo;Reilly Factor he was going on about how much blacks suffered during the &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; era, yada yada yada&hellip; But maybe its just that thinly-veiled facade he puts on to avoid scaring mainstream-thinking Americans off the first time they hear him. You know, people who are really racists but don&rsquo;t know it hear him and think &#8220;Oh, he says some really great things! But, he&rsquo;s kinda racist, isn&rsquo;t he?&#8221; So he says some liberal racial nonsense to calm their fears, but perhaps deep down he really thinks like us?</p>

		<p>About Dubuque, Wikipedia states:<br>
&#8220;The city was the site of several disastrous floods over the years when the Mississippi River went over its banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many older residents of Dubuque remember the 1965 flood as one of the worst in the city&rsquo;s history. Many areas of downtown Dubuque were under several feet of water, which resulted in damage or destruction of homes and businesses in the path of the floods. Only sandbagging efforts of local citizens kept the main highways open to keep traffic flowing. Violence of all kinds quickly spread through the paralyzed city, where looting, robbery, rape and even murder became routine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually that last sentence isn&rsquo;t really in the Wikipedia entry for Dubuque; it&rsquo;s a description of certain other American city in the aftermath of a natural disaster.</p>

<p>AMEN, amen and amen!! I done the same thing about 7 years ago and my life has been so much better for it as well. There is nothing more embarrassing than to be in the company of a &#8216;black sheep&rsquo; of my People. They adopt the black culture in an attempt to be &#8216;cool&rsquo; and &#8216;trendy&rsquo;. To be accepted by the same very people that seek their destruction.</p>
<p>And I literally feel ill when I see that. They have no Pride, Dignity or Integrity whatsoever. They are hanging off another man to &#8216;be&rsquo; somebody. Utterly weak.</p>
<p>One day a friend (more like an acquaintance) of my son came to visit him at my house. He started to walk in and I stopped him. He had a hat sideways with big bold letters on it. Flashy letters that are so prevalent in the black culture. He had his pants down to expose his plaid black-style undies&hellip;and all that other black culture stuff.</p>
<p>I stopped him and told him no matter what clothes he wears, what music he listens to, who he &#8216;hangs&rsquo; with, how he wears his hat, or even HOW he wears his clothes&hellip;that when he woke up every morning he was STILL White, no matter what he does to change it.</p>
<p>He could tell I was calling him a cowardly fool. An insipid and ignorant wanna-be. He never breached my threshold and Ive never seen him again after that. And I refuse to let anyone in my home that absorbs that abhorrent culture.</p>

		<p>The fact is that most white people think and say, in private, the same things as Nugent did.  When blacks lament that &#8220;racism&#8221; has simply gone underground, they are of course correct in that non-black sentiments have not changed appreciably in the last half century.  The MSM exists in a rarified echo chamber that reflects an utter oblivion to the thinking of the common folk.  The media liberals, however, prove their awareness of majority thinking when they color (pun acknowledged) the news to  &mdash;  dare I say whitewash  &mdash;  non-Anglo criminals and other bad actors.  The latest Arab murderer, whom the MSM were delirious to label a &#8220;serial killer&#8221; when it was thought he was a redneck, became a &#8220;knifeman&#8221; when his ethnicity was discovered.  Knifeman?  Who ever heard of such a term?<br>
Anyway, I believe white people have finally had so much racial sensitivity shoved down our throats that we&rsquo;re spitting it out and starting to have our say.</p>

		<p>I appreciate the comments that are critical of Beck. One minute he can be right on, Truth roaring through him, and then, voila, look again  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s kowtowing to the &#8220;noble savage.&#8221; How childish are his mood swings and effusive breakdowns.</p>
<p>Moreover, will Beck be pointing out that the &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech is largely plagiarized, even though it appears in every damned high school and college English textbook in this country? Google Archibald Carey&rsquo;s 1952 RNC Convention speech.  </p>
<p>Lastly, maybe Beck will have the backbone to question why King&rsquo;s wife has had FBI surveillance tapes of MLK sealed till 2027, nearly sixty years after the phoney&rsquo;s death. </p>
<p>I feel sorry for Glenn Beck and Andrew Breitbart. They put themselves out on the front lines, and when they catch fire from the left (especially minorities), they instantly turn into Darkies&rsquo; Best Friend. They are childish and weak. </p>

		<p>Beck speaks highly of blacks and goes off the deep end, highlighting their patriotism and contributions to US History. Speak critically of blacks like we do here on AmRen and he&rsquo;ll go ballistic, and threaten to kick the host off his show. Maybe not with Nugent, but he&rsquo;s done this in the past with others.</p>
<p>Then&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll go home that night, back to that all white, affluent suburban bedroom community (Weston I think),in Fairfield County Connecticut, where about the only things black he sees, is the occasional black Lab, or an oil leak on a driveway. </p>
<p>Once he&rsquo;s done cheer leading blacks on his show and steps back into his world, it&rsquo;s all &#8220;out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>I notice the man usually wears sneakers on his show. Does this suggest he votes with his feet in his choice where to live? </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly call the northern Beck - types hypocrites, but they want the race issue both ways, as long as they aren&rsquo;t personally effected by it. This sets them up for criticism IMO. </p>
<p>The Beck - types are quite common in the greater New York area on the issue of race and can be quite an aggravating sort to deal with. These types hate - and I mean hate, to be called out on their double standards. I&rsquo;d swear an oath on that.</p>

		<p>Thursday August 19th, 2010 National Television: Ted Nugent gets on his knees and goes into detailed praise admiration and worship for the numerous blacks in music politics and entertainment that stirred and inspired his soul. Geroge Lopez calls Ted &#8220;The blackest White dude ever.&#8221; At 6:40 on in the video Ted expresses his love for Mexican immigrants and calls his Mexico-born bass player his blood brother!</p>

		<p>Some are reading way too much into this. Nugent is hardly a racially-aware white man. For heavens&rsquo; sake, he declared Rosa Parks to be &#8220;his hero&#8221; in his book, &#8220;God, Guns % Rock and Roll.&#8221; Does that sound like a man ready to speak at an AR conference? </p>
<p>While being generally PC on the race issue, he has made comments against illegal aliens and such in the past, which is at least something, but I would bet money he would be horrified by AR&rsquo;s general message! </p>

		<p>The Anti White mainstream media loves fake White folk heroes like this Ted Nugent, fake conservative right wing tough guys like Clint Eastwood, C&W; singer Toby Keith. They can all be counted on to get on TV and promote the latest Neo Con foreign war, they put out the lie that there really is &#8220;diversity&#8221; on the mainstream media MSM.</p>
<p>Lou Dobbs was one of these guys for many years and he got very rich pretending to be a voice for &#8220;our side&#8221;.</p>
<p>So many Whites fall for the fake Right Wing media celebrity that is supposed to be &#8220;on our side&#8221;.</p>

Amazingly he gets clapped and cheered all the way. If such thing been said in Britain, you would  bound to have some anti racist  moron in the audience ready to boo and hiss and bring it all down. I&rsquo;m sure some of  you are aware of Clapton&rsquo;s backing for Enoch Powell during a concert in 76, which sprung the modern &#8216;Rock against Racism&rsquo; movement over here, which in turn did more than its share in helping the anti apartheid movement and in getting the S/A terrorist Nelson Mandella into the  public eye.

		<p>With a comment like &#8220;there is a lot of white people in this crowd and I like that&#8221; I think there is no doubt where Ted Nugent stands. Some may not like his comments about animals but I think Ted likes to upset idiots like &#8220;PETA&#8221; and give them nightmares.</p>
<p>   Before people start trashing Glen Beck they need to realize that this man has single-handedly brought the Obama administration to it&rsquo;s knees exposing all the corruption, anti-white and anti-American Marxist garbage that has infested the white house and the Democratic party like some plague.</p>
<p>   Beck took a lot of heat for saying &#8220;Obama hates white people&#8221; on one of his shows.  The first time I saw the video of King Samir Shabazz shouting out to kill all white crackers and white cracker babies was on the Glen Beck show and he showed that video at least four times during the program, after which the Black Panther Party threatened to see him at the 8/28/10 rally. So nobody is going to tell me he has no courage.  They need to look at themselves and ask the question &#8220;what have I done lately?&#8221;.</p>
<p>    I&rsquo;m not crazy about the way Glen has been sucking up to MLK and has joined in the &#8220;poor black plight&#8221; thing either but he has a reason for doing so and it will be all clear to us down the road.  In the meantime we need to look at and appreciate what he has done so far to open people&rsquo;s eyes.     <br>

		<p>I know very little about Ted Nugent and his political views.  However, I distinctly recall him being referred to as a &#8220;cultural Neanderthal&#8221; on MTV several years back.  MTV would never refer to a rap or hip-hop artist, regardless of how degenerate, in those terms.  Clearly, Ted must have overstepped the boundaries of acceptable discourse at some point.   </p>

He decided that Dubuque needed more diversity and I think he did his recruiting on the S. Side of Chicago. what a pathetic clown as are they all.

		<p>Nugent definitely plays both side of the immigration invasion issue.</p>
<p>Sure, you can find videos of Ted stating 100% no nonsense policy of protecting our national borders, just as CNN TV viewers for years saw Lou Dobbs be the only one on the MSM - mainstream media to stand up for American workers and oppose cheap immigrant replacement workers, then Lou went over to the other side, sort of came back a bit and is now just not on the air much.</p>
<p>With Ted - immigration control is something his White American fans are all strongly for, so he can&rsquo;t exactly come out for open borders, though Ted Nugent definitely likes to get invited to rich Bush family events.</p>
<p>Ted Nugent also pushes the ridiculous &#8220;America is the greatest nation in the world&#8221; nonsense and Ted tells Hispanic immigrant groups: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you can&rsquo;t make it in America as long as you work hard, own lots of guns and embrace all things AMERICUUHN.</p>
<p>The last thing we should want Indians from Central America to do is to flood in to the USA and embrace the gun culture.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Iowa-based newspaper also slammed Nugent&rsquo;s remarks in an editorial, and noted that Nugent has a history of incendiary remarks.&#8221;</p>
<p>If by some magical happening we would be rid of 35 million blacks and 40 million Hispanics overnight, in just 6 short months this sycophantic yellow rag would be running editorials<br>
denouncing immigration and all non-whites in terms very close to racism.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because, after losing the vast majority of non-whites, the country would slowly return to a strong pro-white tenor as it was years ago.  I&rsquo;m sure of it, in spite of SPLC, ADL and ACLU influence.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s obvious much of what we read and hear from the politicians and the mainfringe media are simply lip-flapping the party line, because the prevailing mood right now is anti-white and pro-non-white.  Most all of these self-appointed elitists are no more than cowards who will bend whichever way the influencing winds might push them.</p>
<p>In other words, to put it bluntly, they&rsquo;re a pack of spineless cowards.</p>

&lsquo;Come along if you care. Come along if you dare!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&gt; This is a line from his 1967 &#8220;Amboy Dukes&#8221; top ten song, &#8220;Journey to the Center of Your Mind,&#8221; which advocated LSD.  Nugent may be little more than a hippie/redneck, lost in the No Man&rsquo;s Land of cultural contradiction.  Of course, people can change, and I have heard him say in the past that he never did any drugs at all.  But he also produced songs like 1978 &#8220;Wham Bang, Sweet Poon Tang,&#8221; real highbrow stuff pointing us all to the moral high ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Ted Nugent, I am a hunter; just not as big-game as he is. While I haven&rsquo;t always agreed with some of his more outrageous remarks about animals; I&rsquo;ve always admired his stance against the Linda McCartneys and other animal-rights nutcases of the celebrity world. He has showed nothing but guts and he calls them as he sees them. He&rsquo;s pretty much their worst nightmare because they know they can&rsquo;t con him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I can&rsquo;t understand why being a race realist or even a conservative Christian has to mean that one must also be cruel to animals, rather than engage in thoughtful husbandry.  I can&rsquo;t understand how regaling in wiping out species can lead to any sort of spiritual/ethnical/moral high ground.  How we care for nature reflects how we care for ourselves and our future.  </p>
<p>I grew up hunting, but no longer engage in it because it seems to be taken over by pathological killers who must have the latest &#8220;lazy boy&#8221; devices to insure another kill.  I don&rsquo;t see much sport in that.  I used to live remote in Northern California.  By that time, all I would hunt was wild boars.  It was a little scary, because sometimes they charge.  Now that is sport.  But I knew a guy who would go with his dog, into the forest, his dog would corner a boar and he would jump on its back and kill it with a knife.  Now, that is something to respect.  I&rsquo;d love to see one of these fat, so-called sportsman on these hunting programs try that!</p>
<p>I still fish, but when I do, it is with old tech gear, and no depth finder.  I can at least repsect those fishing programs where they catch and release.  That qualifies as a sport, because it is not thrill killing, where hunting as Nugent seems to enjoy seems to be nothing but a thrill kill experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad he has some race consciousness, but I don&rsquo;t think that Ted Nugent has the intellect or alignment of ethics or practices to be of any political use.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Ted Nugent should NOT be solicited or invited to the Amren conference. Ted Nugent was arrested and convicted a couple of days ago for ILLEGALLY BAITING and killing an UNDERAGED MALE DEER. Oh I can hear some saying &ldquo;no big deal&rdquo;. It gets better, he had the incident filmed and the aired it on his REALITY TV HUNTING SHOW!</p>
<p>Criminal activity, the abuse of wildlife, having a film crew catch it on tape and then gleefully present with his full knowledge it on a reality tv show for the wildlife officials to see (that is how they caught him) is not something that represents the represents Amrens core values.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ted Nugent has always been a phony, as many of the above posts recount. I&rsquo;ll add that people should remember the draft deferrment he took for Vietnam, only to come out and reinvent himself as a Reagan patriot in the &rsquo;80s (when it was safe to come out). The only thing good about what he did in Duluth was that he expressed out loud what we all think, even the libs. It is very important for public figures to make such overt statements and I predict more of them will. As for Glenn Beck, well he&rsquo;s another phony, too. But he did for a time do a public service by outing Obama for his anti-white hatred and his marxism. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter when he and others suddenly backpeddle. Once they&rsquo;ve whetted the appetite of whites to hear the whole truth and act on it another spokesman will come up who&rsquo;ll give us something stronger. We may be surprised at what follows.</p>

We&rsquo;re going to need everyone on our side that is willing to stand up, whether they&rsquo;re as committed to every single issue as much as the next guy, whether we&rsquo;d want them as a next door neighbor or not, whether we agree on every possible thing. It has to be boiled down to the biggest issues with all the lesser important individual feelings.</p>
<p>One thing I do know: people change. People (some of them, anyway) do mature and change their outlook on life; they get older, gain experience and their needs and desires change. I certainly don&rsquo;t have the same priorities and attitudes I had 30 years ago. I say sometimes maybe we need to cut someone some slack about things they did in their youth if their actions are now, for the most part, on the right side? </p>
<p>As far as Beck goes, I choose to believe that he&rsquo;s definitely on our side, but he&rsquo;s playing the game he has to play to stay on the air and not get canned outright. Do I agree with every word he says? No, of course not. And perhaps he sees the race issue as not wanting to dislike blacks outright just for being black, but hating unfairness, laziness, injustice and racism as it applies across the board - which he and the rest of us know seems to be comprised of much more black behavior than white. Sometimes you have to lose small battles to win the war; sometimes you have to kiss a little booty to advance your cause. He&rsquo;s simply in a position that the rest of whites are: having to do twice as much for blacks than for whites just to make it blatantly obvious that you&rsquo;re not doing less for them. We need him.</p>

		<p>Read the link in comment #35.  Nugent meant exactly the opposite of what is claimed.  He berated Dubuque and the crowd for being white!  Not surprising coming from someone like Nugent who expresses his love for Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, black musicians, and Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p>https://partners.dubuque365.com/photofeatures/nugent/365_Image_Vault/nugent.html</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the Telegraph Herald seemed to be reporting that Ted Nugent put on a racially biased show last night, what I head [sic] him say in his opening monologue was this: &#8216;Hey there sure are a lot of white people in this crowd. You need to do something about that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;He later said, heavy on the sarcasm, &#8216;Dubuque is a white town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything, Nugent showed how much he honored and respected black performers of the past such as Wilson Pickett, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry and James Brown among others. He said at one point that all American soul came from these black performers who gave their blood, sweat and tears to the music. He even launched into an American Soul retrospective with songs such as Soul Man and Hey Baby.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Most white and black celebrities seem to forget who butters their bread.  I went to a Iron Maiden concert and he gave the same &#8220;rock n&rsquo; roll doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re black or white&#8221; yet there were NO blacks at the Iron Maiden concert.  Why do whites keep pandering to people who will never support them and then insult the very people who made them successful?  Did I miss something in business class?</p>

		<p>Uncle Ted&rsquo;s bubble is a little off, however he would make a much better spokes person than the posters who want to see him with an arrow through his guts. Is it more humane to to be eaten alive by predators, or to die an agonizing death due to starvation? City dwellers are so far removed from reality when it comes to wildlife management there is no logic. Long live Bambi. There is a great distinction between humans and animals, at least there should be. And that thing about Nugent not entering the army, I&rsquo;m sure all his detractors have served admirably. Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>Some of those Hispanic &amp; black percentages include children.</p>
<p>And some of those minority children no doubt, were adopted by childless, affluent white couples and not exlusevely the result of black and hispanic families moving in. </p>
<p>No, the statistics don&rsquo;t lie, but are somewhat misleading when you take this probability into account. </p>

Putting your faith in such obvious self-hating white idiots, just because they happen to make a correct statement about something political here and there is pure foolishness and terribly naive. People like this do more DAMAGE than they ever will good - haven&rsquo;t some of you figured this out by now? I would really have expected more from most readers/posters here. </p>
<p>Seriously - we now listen to and admire people who adore ML King, Rosa Parks and wail endlessly about evil white &#8220;racism?&#8221; Are some really that desperate for SOMEONE to look up to or listen to? </p>

<p>I am from the tri-state area of IL, WI, and IA and have been to Dubuque a few times.  There is a section of town which has  a significant minority population; it&rsquo;s also the most run down and crime-prone section of the city.  Believe it or not, there are areas in Dubuque that are not very safe, although it&rsquo;s not quite as bad as Detroit or East St. Louis - yet.  </p>

		<p>The flack was expected, and I see where many are coming from. I will concede that Ted Nugent is certainly not the best choice, and wouldn&rsquo;t be MY choice. If I failed to research how recent his backward ravings were, that is my mistake. I should have done more examining before I fired off a reply. I&rsquo;m still not ready to throw him under the bus yet without more investigating. Maybe then. However, my opinion of Beck stands. I&rsquo;ve never heard Beck wail white racism. I must have missed that show. I HAVE heard him claiming to dislike racism across the board from anyone.) That&rsquo;s a deal breaker? I still think he&rsquo;s straddling that PC fence to get the message out without being burned at the stake.</p>
<p>But, one question, HH. I have absolutely no &#8216;adoration for King, Rosa Parks or people who wail white racism.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here. So if you choose to exclude those of us who share essentially the same cause but whom you disagree with on some opinions, just how many of you are left? The number would be miniscule - you think it&rsquo;s small NOW - and there would be absolutely NO hope rather than the less hope you now have. Who is out there speaking for you now? Anyone that large numbers of Americans are listening to? Anyone that you approve of? Aren&rsquo;t we here because there is virtually no one willing to speak outloud for us? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that some of us don&rsquo;t meet your standards, but I still respectfully disagree on some (relatively few) issues and wish you well organizing your enclave. I&rsquo;m afraid that sooner or later even there you will end up disagreeing amongst yourselves.  </p>

<p>I respectfully disagree with you. Beck has not bought the Obama White house to its knees. If anything, they have manipulated Beck, O&rsquo;Reilly, Hannity, Breibart and Limbaugh into beleiving that they have manged to best them. While in fact they have FOX, and other conservative media outlets focusing on emotional based groups and issues like the tea partiers, mosques, Shirley Sherrod (we now know that was bogus) while they move this nation closer and closer toward socialism.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at what his administration is doing, it is frightening. They are rapidly dismantling the Reagan legacy. Just look at the radical, left wing, legislation that have passed within the past 18 months! Interestingly, the media is eerily silent about this.</p>
<p>Charles Krauthmmer had a fascinating and astute article about the stealth Obama White House team.  Sad to say, it is Beck and his co-horts,not the current White House that is being played like a fiddle. </p>

		<p>I agree that Glenn Beck has not brought the White House to its knees, though I hope SOMEONE can manage it. But it has to start somewhere. How many people are now talking about Beck, and thus the issues he brings up? How many people are suddenly aware of the threat, the injustice our government is perpetrating on us? How many heretofore silent people are suddenly organizing, speaking out, voting, because he has riled them up? Admit it or not, Beck has stirred the hornet&rsquo;s nest - thank God. If you agree with nothing else, he has awakened a nationwide interest and anger about this Judas (to borrow Dennis&rsquo;s description) that is occupying that White House and the clandestine tyranny he is creating, along with the role race is being used to play in it. They are beginning to believe what I have long felt and many here agree: that Obama is part of a worldwide plan to bring this country down using every possible avenue. Beck may indeed to turn out to be that Judas goat;(Obama certainly managed to fool a lot of people - many of them supposedly &#8216;ultra intelligent&rsquo;), and if he does I will be the first to turn on him and admit I was duped. But I think on most issues he is speaking for us. And yes, HH we ARE desperate for someone to believe in. Putting faith in someone doesn&rsquo;t have to mean blind faith. It doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re blind - or stupid.</p>

		<p>To WhitePlight (post #46):</p>
<p>Your response regarding hunting is based on nothing but generalizations and ignorance.  You make it sound as if all hunters are nothing but brash, trigger-happy rednecks who shoot animals for amusement.  I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if you have been watching too much &#8216;Inside Edition&rsquo; and similar tabloid garbage which portray hunters in this fashion&hellip;and show animal-rights activists harassing Ted Nugent or other hunters in the field!  In case you didn&rsquo;t know, this kind of behaviour is now a criminal offense in virtually all U.S. states.  Just the same; Nugent&rsquo;s outlandish style does not represent me, nor does it any of the friends and relatives of mine who also hunt. </p>
<p>You refer to the Amboy Dukes hit making reference to drugs.  Well, you check the record:  Paul McCartney, Grace Slick, Belinda Carlisle, River Phoenix, etc.  All are/were militant vegetarians and all are also known drug users&hellip;and the list of these polical rebels goes on and on.</p>
<p>Look, I can&rsquo;t speak for what is going on in Northern California; but here in Canada, most of the hunters I know hunt for meat and no other reason.  Besides, where do you think the meat in the supermarket comes from, armed animals?</p>
<p>Hunting is also a prolonged nature hike.  In my many seasons of grouse hunting, I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of seeing a variety of animals, both game but mostly non-game.  Most are not hunted for food; although some may be trapped for their fur.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen fishers, beavers, foxes, river otters, bears, porcupines, along with unnumbered deer.  I once enjoyed the sight of an eagle soaring majestically above a long patch of evergreens; and even had a gray jay land in front of me and literally stop me right in my tracks&hellip;looking for a tasty handout, of course.  And six years ago, I had the rarest, most remarkable opportunity to observe a bobcat only yards away from me, on a forestry road right at the stroke of sunset.  </p>
<p>Hunters have an obligation to be conservationists.  When we see others violating regulations in the field; there are hotlines to help us turn in poachers and other spoil-sports to the proper authorities.</p>
<p>Oh, and just for an exclamation point (and a counter to your absurd claim that we want to see species wiped out); it happened to be a turkey hunter - in the spring of 1999, in a Louisiana swamp - who just may have rediscovered the long-thought-extinct Ivory-billed Woodpecker!<br>
