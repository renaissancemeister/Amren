<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two years ago, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, testified before Congress about the city&rsquo;s impressive progress in closing the gulf in performance between minority and white children. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the students in the city&rsquo;s third through eighth grades, 40 percent of black students and 46 percent of Hispanic students met state standards in math, compared with 75 percent of white students and 82 percent of Asian students. In English, 33 percent of black students and 34 percent of Hispanic students are now proficient, compared with 64 percent among whites and Asians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the latest state math and English tests show that the proficiency gap between minority and white students has returned to about the same level as when the mayor arrived. In 2002, 31 percent of black students were considered proficient in math, for example, while 65 percent of white students met that standard.</p>
<p>Experts have many theories, but no clear answers, about why national progress on closing the gap has slowed. {snip}</p>

		<p>Understanding that the problem exists is generally the first step to solving a problem.</p>
<p>Understanding the true nature of the problem is the second step to solving the problem. This too is generally accepted as being valid by the &#8220;experts&#8221;.</p>
<p>In this case I would venture a guess that the &#8220;experts&#8221; can expound on all sorts of theories as to WHY these &#8220;gaps&#8221; exist. But none of them will be able to tell you with instantaneous and absolute certitude the TRUE nature of the problem.</p>
<p>The &#8220;experts&#8221; will give you all sorts of reasons &#8220;why&#8221;, but none of those reasons will be accurate. NOT the real reason.</p>
<p>I leave it to the readers of this forum to reach their own conclusions, I know mine.</p>

		<p>Without having read the article, the best theory I can come up with is that NYC was fooling around with the test methodology somehow, or making the test so easy that virtually everyone could pass it.  Then someone on high stepped in and made them make the test as hard as it was before, or stopped the cheating.</p>
<p>BTW, on education, and this is for the regular poster &#8220;Jay&#8221;   &mdash;   I thought of you when I read this story from Dallas:</p>

		<p>I once was at a new teachers&rsquo; orientation a several years back for New York City Schools and heard Joel Klein give a short speech in which he described his growing up in a poor neighborhood of the South Bronx, and then going on to achieve educational success through hard work. His message was that if I could do it as a youngster, then the new generation of blacks and Hispanics living in the same area I used to live in can do it too.</p>
<p>All of this assumes that poverty is the only issue to overcome in order to succeed. But leaving aside the realities of the 15 point I.Q. gap between whites and Asians compared to blacks and Hispanics, as shown in &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;, there are important cultural differences. To get an idea of what schools in the South Bronx were like for Jewish kids one should read &#8220;City Boy&#8221;, by Herman Wouk, which is sort of a New York version of &#8220;Tom Sawyer.&#8221; The Jewish students going to school in the thirties, forties and fifties, before many families started to move to the suburbs, were pushed educationally by the culture they were a part of which valued education and provided a peer pressure to succeed which blacks and Hispanics living in the South Bronx do not have.</p>
<p>So in conjunction with Columbia Teachers&rsquo; College and various other institutions that try to change and perfect teaching methodology, in addition to bringing in Teach for America &#8220;whiz kids&#8221;, Klein and Bloomberg thought they&rsquo;d found &#8220;the silver bullet&#8221; to solve the No Child Left Behind mandate to bring black and Hispanic students up to the level of whites and Asians.</p>
<p>I guess with these new results just published the &#8220;experts&#8221; will maybe have to return to &#8220;the legacy of slavery&#8221; for blacks and God knows what for Hispanics in order to try to explain why all the time, effort and money has failed to really change much.</p>

<p><i>Experts have many theories, but no clear answers, about why national progress on closing the gap has slowed.</i></p>
<p>Has the closing of the gap slowed or has it stopped at a pre-determined level? <br>

		<p> Mayor Bloomberg, Mr. Klein, allow me to let you in on a little secret: Equality ain&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be!</p>
<p> As a matter of fact, &#8220;equality&#8221; as it comes to human beings, is a &#8220;social construct,&#8221; not a fact. Different races have unequal abilities in various areas, just as individuals do. World IQ tests show East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews to have the highest IQs; the fact that Asians score a little higher in math as a group, than all Whites as a group, points that up.</p>
<p> Sub-Saharan Africans, and their descendants who live in other parts of the world, consistently score lowest of all on IQ tests. Mestizos tend to score somewhat higher. It&rsquo;s all right there, in the results of your New York City Public Schools tests. Why don&rsquo;t you just admit you&rsquo;re betting on a losing horse, and move on to something else?</p>

		<p>Bloomberg and Klein know exactly what&rsquo;s necessary to close the achievement gap. First, make sure the White kids get no more than one hour of sleep a day. Put them on an 800-calorie daily diet with no protein. Force them to sniff glue. Have the football team punch them in the head for an hour every day. Then add twenty points to the black kids&rsquo; test scores. Simple as pie.</p>

		<p>Many theories but no answers.  Right.  But WE know what causes the gap, don&rsquo;t we?<br>
Difference is, we aren&rsquo;t afraid to say what it is, and they will do anything to avoid saying what it is - even dream up convoluted theories - to avoid stating the obvious.</p>

		<p>Those are terrible numbers for white students.  35% should not be failing math and English.  If your child is in a bad school you have to pick up the slack by giving them extra educational work to do and demanding they do their best.  Too many white parents have a passive approach to education and as a result their children never reach their potential which has a domino effect on the rest of their lives.</p>

		<p>I guess the liberals will keep on chasing their tails on this issue till doomsday.  The vast majority of people don&rsquo;t believe any of their nonsensical claims, so they continue to preach to the choir.  In the full article, one reads that teachers were offered incentives to see that students passed, so who wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if some teachers employed cheating to boost grades?  <br>
By continuing to blather about the desperate need to &#8220;close the achievement gap&#8221; the liberals simply keep the public constantly aware of it. </p>

		<p>These so-called &#8220;experts&#8221; have no answers for the achievement gap? Why don&rsquo;t they read &#8220;The Bell Curve&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I love it how, in two of the most liberal urban enclaves- New York and San Francisco- the achievement gap between Bantus and mestizos as opposed to Caucasians and Asians, is as pronounced there, as it is in Mississippi or Alabama. Why is that? Are they not spending copious amounts of money on Bantu and mestizo schoolchildren? Aren&rsquo;t they providing them with free school lunches so that they&rsquo;re getting proper nutrition? Aren&rsquo;t they enrolled in &#8220;Head Start&#8221; programs, which Lyndon Johnson told us would correct the problem of the gap, back in 1965?</p>
<p>These &#8220;experts&#8221; have no solutions. Or, rather, they pretend to have no explanations. They keep dancing around the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>We at Amren know the answer, don&rsquo;t we? James Watson knows the answer, and he got pilloried for it. Jared Taylor and Phillipe Rushton and Richard Herrnstein know the answer as well. They too, have been denounced.</p>
<p>Sometime in the near future, the curricula for Bantus and mestizos will be so dumbed-down, that all that will be required for a scholarship to an Ivy League school, is to recite the alphabet and count to ten on their fingers.</p>

<p>Do any of those &#8220;experts&#8221; theorize that genetically influenced racial differences in average IQ likely play a substantial role in the school acheivement gap? Of course not!! Why? Because according to the cherry picked &#8220;experts&#8221; of the MSM that&rsquo;s &#8220;pseudoscientific&#8221; nonsense that only &#8220;ignorant&#8221; racists would believe and promote. Every &#8220;enlightened&#8221; person knows that it is established scientific fact that race is a meaningless social construct! The Human Genome project established this a  long time ago. Never mind what the project&rsquo;s first president James Watson said about race, intelligence and evolution a while back. After all, he&rsquo;s just a &#8220;senile&#8221; old man who likes to promote his own &#8220;personal prejudices.&#8221;  And anyone who argues otherwise is a vile and sinister &#8220;bigot.&#8221;  End of discussion!!</p>

		<p>The answer is in the genes.  How one rears children, clean the house, go to work, approach life is all coded in the genes.  These fools keep going after the glory that they will be the one closing the racial gaps.  It should be forced upon these fools to waste their own money in chasing after their tail, round and round going nowhere.  In the mean while, China is fast pulling ahead laughing all the way.</p>

		<p>1.  Every few years the parents get dumber. The intellectual height of US blacks was in the 50&rsquo;s. Thanks to King and LBJ, black selfconfidence is in freefall because of headon competition with whites and demands to conform to civilized culture.</p>
<p>2. Black kids can&rsquo;t focus. They are mostly plugged in constantly to ipods and MP3 players, or play games on the smart phones these &#8220;deprived&#8221; youth constantly use, in class as well as at home.</p>
<p>3.  Hip hop does corrode the mind, particularly people who lack inate abilities in the areas of higher cognitive recognition and synthesis. And blacks can&rsquo;t believe that media, including the music industry, are owned by certain non-black ethnic groups and even nations (Japan), who love the profits and throw chump change to the &#8220;artists&#8221; and DJs who recite and play the monotonous and perverted lyrics designed to keep blacks in their loser place. </p>
<p>What a hoot. The people who &#8220;fought&#8221; for &#8220;freedom&#8221; under red sympathizer King are now the mental slaves of Asian, European and white American media moguls and, a few white and Jewish sports owners who provide the black masses with black role models like Kobe Bryant and Michael Vick. </p>
<p>The &#8220;gap&#8221; will widen ever more but the Obamaniks and their boosters in the Moron Media will find a way to &#8220;normalize&#8221; the tests to end the &#8220;gap&#8221;.  </p>
<p>So Mayor Bloomberg, not to worry, not to worry.</p>

<p>They need to come to this site! We don&rsquo;t have any &#8220;theories&#8221; but we&rsquo;ve got LOTS clear answers! Of course they would&rsquo;nt be the kind of &#8220;clear answers&#8221; these &#8220;experts&#8221; would want to hear. I would imagine that we&rsquo;re much more &#8220;expert&#8221; on this subject than these &#8220;experts&#8221; will ever be.</p>
<p> They included worsening economic conditions for poor families-</p>
<p>Then why is it that poor White kids out perform black kids from affuent homes?</p>
<p>  -and an increase in fatherless black households, </p>
<p>And whos fault is that? It&rsquo;s no different here than in Africa where there&rsquo;s no &#8220;White racisim&#8221; holding them down. The men have no idea how many &#8216;baby mamas&rsquo; he&rsquo;s made as he wonders the countryside, and the women can&rsquo;t remember which tribes the &#8216;baby daddies&rsquo; came from.</p>
<p>-social factors that interfere with students&rsquo; educational progress.</p>
<p>I suppose that would mean playing &#8216;bassetball&rsquo;, hangin&rsquo; with the hommies and &#8216;keepin it rreeeeaaal&rsquo;, aimlessly cruising around all night blasting rap from their car when others [ working people ] are trying to sleep etc..  <br>

		<p>Interesting how they always separate &#8220;Asians&#8221; from their concern with minorities. They can at least claim that there are &#8220;cultural&#8221; factors like 2 parent family homes, stress on education, familial expectations, and pride in the face of actual achievement. They don&rsquo;t even have to go &#8220;genetic&#8221; (although, if they did, Game Over!) I don&rsquo;t think any of these geniuses are actually so perplexed about the supposed gap. They know full well why it will never be closed unless the gap is closed from the top down. The bottom will never rise to the top.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this comparing appeles and oranges? The first statistics, the &#8220;pre-Bloomberg&#8221; numbers, are for math. The second set of statistics, the &#8220;post-Bloomberg&#8221; ones, are for English. And besides the proficiency levels they give suggest that they have DECREASED for both minorities and for whites.</p>

		<p>Articles like the one above have been appearing in one form or another for at least 50 years. At this point they come off as bad satire.</p>
<p>Still, you have to give some credit to liberals and their friends in the education business for the creativity to come up with 50 years of new excuses. </p>
<p>As initiatives and programs come into being only to fail and be replaced by new initiatives and programs - which also fail - you&rsquo;d think there would be some embarrassment on the part of the &#8220;experts&#8221; behind these efforts. But there is not. They simply march on in a circle.</p>
<p>I think everyone knows the answer - that the gap is an intelligence issue as blacks are genetically more than one standard deviation behind whites in IQ. I&rsquo;m certain those who refuse to even consider this reason know it to be true. Perhaps because it is so obvious makes it all the more frightening to some. </p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why the lie must be perpetuated. It does no one any good - or at least I first thought. Now I wonder if this is just simply a ruse to suck money out of taxpayers. This sham can keep a lot of marginally proficient individuals employed along with keeping a whole lot of unqualified blacks employed and on the education gravy train. </p>
<p>The vast majority of PhDs &#8220;earned&#8221; by blacks is in the field of education - a discipline not exactly known for its rigorous intellectual standards. Through affirmative action and hiring bias blacks have moved in and basically destroyed public education in areas of the country where they fill management roles and more than 30% of teaching positions.</p>
<p>Admitting the truth - that inherent intelligence in most blacks is lacking - would possibly shut down the gravy train and all the freebies it delivers. </p>
<p>A sad state of affairs, indeed.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, in Lost Angeles,  Mexifornia:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said Monday that parents have a right to know if their children&rsquo;s teachers are effective, endorsing the public release of information about how well individual teachers fare at raising their students&rsquo; test scores&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The LA Times is going to release the names of  individual teachers in its paper this week (unless the teachers&rsquo; union can muster up a court order) and judge teacher effectiveness via student test scores.</p>
<p>From here on in, I expect teachers to step up &#8216;cooking the books&rsquo; on state tests, ensuring that when names and student test scores are published in the paper, they will avoid transfers or firings.</p>
<p>Expect test scores in LA to start rising exponentially in the near future.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;What&rsquo;s there to hide?&rsquo; Duncan said  &#8216;In education, we&rsquo;ve been scared to talk about success.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Mr. Duncan (or is it Senor Duncan?) it is YOU who has been scared to talk about intractable IQ difference between the races and THE FACT that blacks/hispanics have an average IQ range of 80-90 vs. 100+ for Whites/Asians which vastly limits their achievement levels.</p>
<p>It is idiots such as yourself, M. Duncan, that perpetuate the myths that non-Whites with 80 IQs can be educated in the same manner, to the same extent, as White/Asian children.</p>
<p>It is you who insists on hiding reality.  </p>
<p>I am convinced you and others of your ilk, phony educational pooh-bahs reaping high salaries from the government and in the universities, well know about IQ differences (how could you not?) but march to the PC drum in fear of losing your career, in fear of ostracism, attacks in the media, loss of grants, special privileges, awards and accolades.</p>

<p>Books such as these are strictly verboten in discussions of the achievement gap.  There are only two ways a teacher could lose his/her job:  moral turpitude and defending racial IQ differences as prima facie for the achievement gap.</p>
<p>The teacher accused of moral turpitude has a better chance of returning to the classroom than does the heretic.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;These multiculturalist liberals just deny the obvious and continue to defend the undefendable&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Empirical data mean nothing.  Facts mean nothing.  Instead, the truth will be twisted and distorted to extract ever more White taxpayer monies to fund &#8216;research&rsquo;, implement a new program and, as always, bash Whites.</p>
<p>I am starting to believe that this isn&rsquo;t about closing the achievement gap at all, but rather is a part of the War on Whites, to bring down White children, another excuse to scream &#8216;White Oppression!&rsquo; and strip us of our wealth via ever more punitive taxes, more transfer of wealth to the government to fund PC lies.</p>
<p>And finally, this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;California Secretary of Education Bonnie Reiss also weighed in Monday</p>
<p>&#8216;The data is there,&rsquo; (sic) Reiss said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>HA.  That is all ye need to know.</p>

		<p>In order to close the gap, all you have to do is bring down whites&rsquo; education, and that is best achieved by mixing them with blacks in the classroom. What we need is separation of black and white to guarantee a proper white education. Most blacks in turn should have a reduced education to grade 9 with basic focus on reading, writing and basic math. Nothing else will work. Any honest teacher will tell you that.</p>

		<p>If you say the difference is cultural, that&rsquo;s racist too. At least it is if you are suggesting non-white value education differently or have a different culture - and you don&rsquo;t clearly suggest this is not racial and you&rsquo;re mostly talking about whites. This from the same people who examine nothing but race. Or perhaps I use the term &#8216;examine&rsquo; a bit loosely. Whites need to realize it&rsquo;s about nothing but anti-white propaganda - but instead of being considered &#8216;bigotry&rsquo; or racism, it&rsquo;s encouraged at every step. </p>

		<p>Poster #11 mentioned that the fail rates for whites was far too high.  What a lock of Amreners don&rsquo;t realize is that a lot of these &#8216;white&rsquo; kids are eastern European ethnics of various kinds who come from, ahem, shall we say less than advanced cultures themselves.  I am from a wasp background that goes back to jamestown.  When I see what passes for &#8216;white&rsquo; these days in urban ghettos I am appalled.</p>

		<p>I have worked in several public schools in my time.  Some have more blacks than latinos, some have more latinos than blacks.  I was always a sincere teacher and did my best to help any student improve, regardless of race.  In my time I have come to three conclusions.</p>
<p>1)  Latinos (excluding dominicans) are smarter than blacks over all, but more prone to laziness in schooling due to cultural factors that encourage &#8216;helping the family&rsquo; more than studying and leading lives that are carefree and easy.</p>
<p>2)  Black students are almost all (99%) in need of serious remediation and are usually 4-6 grade levels behind what their age says they should be.</p>
<p>3)  The Asian mental prowess is over-rated on a large scale because a small number of asians are scoring so high as to bring the entire group along with it.  There are plenty of dumb asians to go around with southern-tier asians (India to the Phillipines) being the worst and japanese being the best.  Chinese are 50/50.</p>

		<p>Steve Sailer exposed this story for a distortion.  I lost the URL, but his point was that just because the numerical percentage gap between blacks and whites was narrower in the last test compared to the second-to-last test or the current test does not mean that the true achievement gap actually narrowed or widened at any time.  The thing Sailer wants to look at as the standard deviation   &mdash;   It might be the &#8220;narrow&#8221; gap of the last test was at or close to one full SD, while the &#8220;wide&#8221; gap of the most recent and the third to the last test also was about one full SD.</p>

		<p>What abouit the &#8220;gap&#8221; between white and jewish students. Dont jews perform better than white students? Isnt there a lot of discrimination against white students,with equal or superior white students being denied entrance into elite universitites while Jews and much less qualified &#8220;minorities&#8221; are let in? lets attack the White/jewish racial gap. Its been proven that jews discriminate against whiytes. Lets spend more  &mdash;  much much more  &mdash;  money on WHITE STUDENTS!! To CLOSE THE GAP!</p>

		<p>With regard to programs that claim to reduce the race gap in education I always suspect fraud.  I once associated with a teacher at a Cleveland high school who made a startling confession to me after a few beers:  he and the principal had stayed late after school and changed answers on a state proficiency test.  This was to increase the pass rate for the school and to promote particular students they felt attached to.  The school, now defunct, was overwhelmingly black.  I thought about reporting this to some authority, but I had no proof.  Such cheating may be widespread  &mdash;  it is easy to do.  This is probably why programs that reduce the achievement gap cannot be replicated in other places.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, ETS (Educational Testing Services) now has a program that spots too many erasures and sends up a red flag  &mdash;  several school principals have been caught changing answers after school via this method.</p>
<p>Also, ETS is alerted when too many of the same wrong answers appear in a particular cluster (such as a class room or school) or the scores are very very close together, indicating the same answers (including &#8216;wrong&rsquo; answers) were given to the same students.</p>
<p>I learned about this at a &#8216;professional development&rsquo;  &mdash;  the &#8216;leaders&rsquo; inferring that if you&rsquo;re going to change students&rsquo; answers, be aware of  ETS&rsquo;s latest tactics. </p>
