<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An insurer for the Philadelphia Housing Authority has reportedly agreed to pay $250,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim against executive director Carl R. Greene, but PHA still faces a host of other controversies.</p>
<p>A women&rsquo;s rights group is calling for an investigation of Greene&rsquo;s conduct, and U.S. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) wants to know why Greene is better paid than Mayor Nutter and Gov. Rendell combined. Meanwhile, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating how PHA is using $31 million in stimulus money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I question the propriety of settling the case,&#8221; Street [PHA&rsquo;s board chairman, former mayor, John F. Street] said, while the PHA board is &#8220;in the middle&#8221; of trying to determine what happened between Greene, 53, and Elizabeth Helm, 29, a former interior decorator with PHA.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elliott [Helm&rsquo;s attorney, John M. Elliott] said his client has refused to sign a confidentiality agreement and added that she will &#8220;fully cooperate with any federal or state authorities who are investigating Carl Greene or PHA,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a four-page letter sent April 21 to Street, Mayor Nutter, Gov. Rendell and nine others, Elliott accused Greene of &#8220;serial predatory sexual misconduct&#8221; and alleged that he groped Helm at the Prime Rib Restaurant at 1701 Locust St. after &#8220;insisting&#8221; she meet him there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Helm allegation, and reports of three other sexual harassment complaints against Greene, prompted the Women&rsquo;s Law Project to call on the PHA board to investigate the allegations and publicly disclose the results.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greene was hired to head PHA in 1998 amid allegations that he had sexually harassed an employee of a Detroit housing commission that he headed. That complaint was resolved with a settlement under which the complainant was paid money and Greene admitted no wrongdoing.</p>
<p>As of now, however, Greene has decided on his own to take several weeks off to deal with what he has described as stress-related exhaustion.</p>
<p>Greene&rsquo;s troubles started ten days ago with the disclosure that he was facing foreclosure on his $615,035 townhouse in the upscale Naval Square development in the city&rsquo;s Schuylkill section. The next day, news broke that he was being dunned by the IRS for $52,000 in back taxes. Both matters have since been resolved, according to Greene.</p>
<p>After dropping out of sight for much of last week, on Thursday he announced he was taking a break, and on Friday told the Inquirer, &#8220;I have suffered from personal failings,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I offer my most humble apologies to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greene said he was emotionally undone by the lien, filed in December, which froze his bank account and meant he could not pay the mortgage.</p>
<p>The Inspector General&rsquo;s office of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has also opened an investigation into PHA&rsquo;s use of stimulus funds for renovating 340 scattered-site vacant houses.</p>
<p>The program audit, started last month, involves the spending of $31 million in federal stimulus dollars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, asked HUD Secretary Shaun L.S. Donovan why Greene&rsquo;s salary is $306,370  &mdash;  about $100,000 more than Donovan himself earns.</p>
<p>Combined with a $44,188 bonus, that is more that Gov. Rendell and Mayor Nutter&rsquo;s pay.</p>
<p>Grassley demanded to know if HUD &#8220;was aware of questionable financial activities&#8221; at PHA, and what complaints have been filed &#8220;by employees regarding problems at the housing authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also wanted to know about $2.12 weekly payroll deductions nonunion employees at PHA are required to make to a murky nonprofit Greene established called the Pennsylvania Institute of Affordable Housing.</p>
<p>PHA has received about $127 million in federal stimulus money it is using that to build or renovate 1,200 units of housing.</p>

<p>So this babby-momma won a ghetto lottery and the thug in a tie got off with no charges!!! What a scam.</p>
<p>PHA has received about $127 million in federal stimulus money it is using that to build or renovate 1,200 units of housing.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that about $105,000 per unit? For PUBLIC HOUSING??? I get a vision of a Laquisha Jackson and her babby-daddy Cedric Jones laying around in their $105,000 home complaining about those &#8216;racisss&rsquo; White folks.</p>
