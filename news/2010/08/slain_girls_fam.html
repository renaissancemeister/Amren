			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Rogers, Houston Chronicle, August 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Family members of a teen gunned down last week railed against America&rsquo;s immigration policy on Friday after learning one of the suspected gunmen was in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Melvin Alvarado, 22, and Jonathan Lopez-Torres, 18, have been charged with capital murder in the Aug. 7 shooting death of 14-year-old Shatavia Anderson.</p>
<p>Immigration officials have said Alvarado was deported in April 2008 and again in May 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two men appeared Friday in court, where relatives of Anderson donned memorial T-shirts and called for tougher enforcement of immigration laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to see what they&rsquo;re doing in Arizona done here,&#8221; Lambert [Shatavia&rsquo;s uncle, Joe Lambert] said, referring to recent laws targeting illegal immigration in the Grand Canyon state.</p>
<p>Community activist Quanell X accompanied family members to court and also took a stand on the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is time that the immigration policy in this country has more teeth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This man should not have been allowed to sneak into the country over and over again and snuff out the life of this little girl. We do, obviously, have a border problem.&#8221;</p>

								<h2>Attacks Against Mexicans Inflame Tensions in NYC</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Christian Salazar, Fresno Bee, August 16, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Residents of Port Richmond  &mdash;  where an influx of newcomers from Latin America over the past decade has transformed the community  &mdash;  alternately blame the attacks on the economy, unemployment and the debate over Arizona&rsquo;s immigration law.</p>
<p>And although most of the suspects were described as young black men and investigated for bias crimes, a grand jury has indicted only one of seven people arrested on a hate-crime charge.</p>
<p>But Isaias Lozano, a day laborer, said he knows why he was attacked and robbed in December by &#8220;morenos&#8221;  &mdash;  the Spanish word he uses to describe his black neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;They hate us because we&rsquo;re Mexicans,&#8221; he said while sitting at El Centro del Inmigrante, a center for immigrant day workers. &#8220;They aren&rsquo;t robbing just anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Across the United States, the immigration debate plays out in suspicion of outsiders and sometimes escalates into violence. Port Richmond, tucked in a corner of New York City that most visitors never see, is wrestling with the perennial question of how people from different backgrounds can live together and get along.</p>
<p>Some community leaders here blame the attacks on hoodlums preying on day laborers, who are perceived as easy targets because they often carry cash home from work. Others say the Arizona law is stirring up a climate of intolerance, even these thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of Port Richmond&rsquo;s black residents assert that newcomers&rsquo; presence touches a nerve. Mike Mason, 47, a teacher who works in New Jersey, said the arrival of Mexican immigrants had changed the texture of the community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2008, the number of Hispanics living on the island grew roughly 40 percent, according to Census bureau statistics analyzed by City University of New York&rsquo;s Latino Data Project, with much of that growth coming from the Mexican community.</p>
<p>Many of those began to coalesce around the Port Richmond neighborhood, which had long been predominantly black and low-income. The neighborhood&rsquo;s main commercial thoroughfare, once marked by empty storefronts, suddenly came alive with Mexican businesses selling pinatas, bars playing Spanish-language heavy metal, and grocers stocking chilies and tomatillos. The neighborhood developed a new nickname: &#8220;Little Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexicans soon began reporting that they were attacked by their black neighbors.</p>
<p>One organization documented 21 assaults against day laborers one summer in 2003. When a day laborer was viciously stabbed and killed two years later, neighbors quickly blamed the black community, until reputed Latin Kings gang members were charged with the man&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>In recent months, police have deployed additional foot and mounted patrols, a command post and Mexican-born officers to distribute bilingual fliers with safety tips. The FBI joined in creating a task force to look into civil rights abuses in the neighborhood. Residents have aired grievances at numerous town hall meetings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rodolfo Olmedo was beaten and robbed of his cell phone and wallet on April 5. Four suspects have been arrested and charged; police investigated it as a bias crime, but a grand jury indicted the suspects only on robbery and gang assault charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Olmedo, who was hospitalized for five days and was briefly in a coma, contends he was targeted because of his ethnicity, not because he had been involved in a related incident or because the suspects wanted to steal his belongings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; he said in Spanish, &#8220;a hate crime.&#8221;<br>

<p>Are they volunteering to defend this country from invaders and risk their lives (not mention expend some serious effort) in order to fix the problem?</p>
<p>Or is what they are really asking for here (incredibly) is for the white man, whom they despise, murder, rape, steal from and assault at every opportunity, to come to their defense.</p>

		<p>Ok, now they got that settled, isn&rsquo;t about time for Whites to do the same and demand a &#8220;crackdown&#8221; everytime a White woman is raped or a white is murdered by a black. Not enough hours in a day or days in a year for that to happen. One day the White man will wake up and start fighting back in this one sided war against Whites going on now.  Like in the movie &#8220;Tora, Tora, Tora&#8221;, they will be saying &#8220;We have awaken a sleeping giant&#8221;.  I for one can&rsquo;t wait for that.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t say! </p>
<p>For at least the last 50 years blacks have unleashed millions - literally millions - of rapes, robberies and murders upon whites and everyone else. Now they are tired of violence?</p>
<p>Sorry Quannel X. There will be no alliances with this white boy over immigration.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, &#8220;people from different backgrounds&#8221; just cannot get along with one another and live in harmony and peace. NEVER have been able to ANYWHERE at any point in time. </p>
<p>NOT just in the U.S., but ANYWHERE at ANY point in time.</p>
<p>And probably always will be that way too! Sad to say, but just a fact.</p>

		<p>Quannell X and I agree.  A broken clock is right twice a day.</p>
<p>As for their wishes happening, forget about it.  Rick Perry has already come out against SB 1070, said he wouldn&rsquo;t sign a similar bill in Texas.  Which does not surprise me at all   &mdash;   He&rsquo;s always been a big time open borders kook.  Which is also why, in spite of the fact that she likely wouldn&rsquo;t have signed a law like 1070, either, Kay Bailey Hutchinson was the least problematic of the three major candidates for Texas Governor this year (the third being Kathy Medina), so she would have gotten my vote.</p>

		<p>Finally they are beginning to get it.  But only because blacks are being killed.  When it was mainly whites, they were mum.  Hey.  Since whites are more often killed by blacks, can we demand deportation and border enforcement against blacks?  If we are going to talk about revising the 14th Amendment, let&rsquo;s go for the whole banana.  Deport the blacks back to the African culture they take such pride in, and lay claim to, out of hatred for white civilized European type culture.</p>

		<p>Off this subject a bit, but did anyone hear Rush today talk about the moron, Denise Brown, (Nicole&rsquo;s sister) setting up a MUSEUM for OJ for all his &#8220;accomplishments&#8221;?  Also she is fighting to get him released from jail!  What is wrong with Whites such as her??? We hear White families forgiving nonwhites who rape and murder their loved ones all the time.</p>
<p>We all need to denounce her and her actions and &#8220;change of heart&#8221; because it seems to me that far too many Whites have completely gone insane!</p>

<p>This &#8220;Quanell X&#8221; is, of course, absolutely right.  But a <i>White</i> man who made the same public statement would be silenced at once, demonized and persecuted into silence, if not legally prosecuted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to point out the obvious when you&rsquo;re a member of the privileged race, and permitted to speak racial realities without retribution.</p>
<p>As I have long said, the racial polarization between blacks and mestizos will soon reach critical mass.  The time that the controlled governmedia will be able to keep the lid on the obvious is drawing to and end.  And when that happens, White racial awareness   &mdash;   the deepest nightmare of the corrupt &#8220;black leadership&#8221; and our Imperial government   &mdash;   will not be far behind.<br>

<p> Yes, the Arizona law turned these law-abiding blacks into hateful, violent bigots. It must be all those white people in Arizona who want our immigration laws enforced who are responsible for this atrocity. This is another diversity liberals attempt at a flight from criminal responsibility. </p>

<p><br>
We are truly down the rabbit-hole and through the looking-glass when a black radical whose last name is &#8220;X&#8221; has a more conservative attitude to border security than the President. </p>
<p>Perhaps Obama could issue a statement saying the illegal Mexican fence-hoppers &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; when they killed young Shantavia. </p>
<p>As for the Mexicans up in NY being robbed by the local &#8220;morenos&#8221;, is there any point in reminding these people that the Af-Am&rsquo;s are merely doing to the illegal Mexicans what Mexicans do to <i>their</i> illegal immigrants who sneak in from Costa Rica, Honduras, etc? The major difference is that when Mexicans rob and beat non-Mexican invaders, they do so with the full complicity of the Mexican gov&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>I remember reading a similar article here at Amren a while back.  It told us how blacks target Asians for violent crime and how they murdered an old Asian woman.  It seems that any non-blacks who live among blacks are at high risk for violence from blacks.  Once in a while, a member of the victimized ethnicity (in this case a Hispanic) strikes back and attacks a random black.  At that point, the blacks become upset demand justice.  Although it&rsquo;s unfortunate that the young girl was murdered, I have no sympathy for the black community in general.</p>

		<p>Diversity makes this such a great country. Never mind that every group hates every other group, and that it costs us millions every year to try to prevent slaughter, yet to keep everyone together. Never mind that every single race in this country would prefer to live amongst themselves and their own kind. Diversity is our strength!</p>

		<p>From post 3: &#8220;The first time an illegal commits a crime he should be deported.&#8221; </p>
<p>Since being in the country illegally is illegal, he should be deported for that alone. No need for even <i>one</i> follow-up crime. </p>
<p>Better yet, of course, he should not be permitted into the country to begin with. </p>
<p>P.S.: The above-mentioned racial hypocrisy &mdash; that it&rsquo;s permissible to be outraged about violent crime by illegal aliens only when blacks are victims &mdash; should be obvious to all, but isn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>The average white American seems to be oblivious. </p>

<p>Yes, I noticed that too. It&rsquo;s all the fault of those racist whites in Arizona who are causing this.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible how journalists and apologists manage to twist virtually anything around so as to place the blame on whites and &#8220;white racism&#8221;. There&rsquo;s no limit to their ingeniousness in finding ways to blame whites for everthing!</p>

<p>When I visit the small town I grew up in (all white while I was living there prior to 1995) and I see black homeboys walking the streets now, I say the same thing as the black gentleman is quoted as saying above.</p>
<p>Despite the grandstanding of the self-appointed leaders of both blacks and latinos, the simple fact of the matter is that on the ground they do not get along at all.  </p>
<p>Latinos (mestizos, indians and all-whites) hate blacks and are so racist against them as to be unbelievable.  (And they get away with it.  You should see how mexicans and south americans look down on darker skinned dominicans!)  They call blacks &#8220;bruta&#8221; which translates as &#8220;savages.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only problem with the ongoing, low-level black/brown race war is that whites inevitably get affected.  Both groups seek safety and &#8216;a better life&rsquo; by moving into white areas in ever greater numbers.  Then we lose our neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>Thanks to Mexican laborer, Isaias Lozano, there is a new word to describe Bantu people:</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreno&#8221;</p>
<p>As in, 65% of the NFL is moreno, compared to 85% of the NBA being moreno. Morenos make up 90% of the population of Gary, IN and 99.9% of East St. Louis, IL is moreno.</p>
<p>Having said that, I am not surprised that Bantus would be screaming and foaming at the mouth that a Bantu girl was shot and killed by mestizos. This happens every time, in every city, whenever a Bantu is shot and killed by someone of another race.</p>
<p>If Shatavia Anderson were shot and killed white police officer named Patrick Mulligan, a Hispanic grocer Jose Delgado or Korean restaurant owner Cho Sei Sung, there would be a full-scale riot going on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Shatavia Anderson were shot and killed by Willie Kasavubu or Jamarcus Africa Washington, they would be silent. The most they do is call for more &#8220;gun control&#8221;.</p>
<p>So much for the &#8220;rainbow coalition&#8221;. Like all rainbows, they are temporary and disappear quickly, when conditions change. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Others say the Arizona law is stirring up a climate of intolerance, even these thousands of miles away.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why should Americans &#8220;tolerate&#8221; being colonized by foreign invaders? Americans all over the nation want an &#8220;Arizona law&#8221; passed. As far as the Mexicans moaning about &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, well when you colonize another country and illegally invade it, you engender hate and rightfully so. I don&rsquo;t advocate beating or attacking them but immediate deportation and control of our borders.</p>

		<p>You almost have to laugh at the cluelessness of the Federal Government. I like the sentence &#8220;The FBI joined in creating a task force to look into civil rights abuses in the neighborhood&hellip;&#8221;<br>
I have to admit I just can&rsquo;t get a handle on the relationship citizens of this country have with the Feds. One minute they&rsquo;re Albert Schweitzer, the next Benito Mussolini, the next Barney Frankenfurter.<br>
Reality keeps banging each and every one of us over the head with cast iron frying pans and you can count on them coming around afterward giving out band-aids.<br>
I say let&rsquo;s all move to Afghanistan and we&rsquo;ll get some help.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately I am quite confident that Joe Lambert votes for Democrats, as do 90% of American blacks.  So he has no right to complain about illegal immigration.  Democrats are even less willing than Republicans to enforce immigration law.  That would be racist, you know.  La Raza and Harry Reid tell us so.<br>

		<p>Well, you know what, black people?  Us whites are tired of you.  We&rsquo;re tired of your attitudes.  We&rsquo;re tired of your behavior.  We&rsquo;re tired of you forcing yourselves into our lives.  We&rsquo;re tired of you looking out for your own race, yet criticizing us for doing the same.  We&rsquo;re tired of you using lawsuits and intimidation to get what you want instead of persuading us in an intelligent and civil manner.  Now you blacks know how we feel!</p>
