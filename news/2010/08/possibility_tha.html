			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edward Nelson, New York Examiner, August 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Unfortunately, the Connecticut workplace shooting leaves more facts that have not been considered. {snip} Some people don&rsquo;t want to discuss racism as being a form of violence because it would reveal that they themselves are in fact extremely violent and in denial about it.</p>
<p>{snip} Hartford Distributors may have used racism and gradually managed to kill Omar Thornton mentally and emotionally before the killing spree via attrition. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [A] fellow co-worker who was employed with Omar Thornton at Hartford Distributors has come forward stating that he had seen the racist taunts: &#8220;Stuff on walls. Racist comments. I saw with my own eyes.&#8221; More importantly, the fellow co-worker said Mr. Thornton was hired as a truck driver; yet, he was assigned to loading boxes in the warehouse. Mr. Thornton had to fight to get behind the wheel. The co-worker then states that Hartford Distributors are lying and the evidence is in Omar&rsquo;s cell phone. These statements are serious and they are not based upon speculation. This places the co-worker in a position to be called as a key witness to racism within Hartford Distributors. Although the co-worker is no longer under the employ of Hartford Distributors, he has witnessed these incidents first-hand. These statements make it appear as if Hartford Distributors is deliberately being obtuse to shield themselves from potential liability. {snip}</p>
<p>If Hartford Distributors created an atmosphere of institutionalized racism within the workplace, then Omar Thornton&rsquo;s contributing accomplice would be Hartford Distributors who subtly enraged Mr. Thornton to kill 9 employees. In no uncertain terms am I expressing that Omar Thornton was justified by what he did. However, I am expressing that if employers are allowed to continue with business as usual without being held accountable, the contributing employer accomplice will continue its uncorrected racist practices with the result being identical to the facts currently before us. {snip}</p>
<p>If not, the subjective side of the alleged violence will continue without correction. Racist employers are in dire need help to redirect their violent tendencies in the workplace! If Mr. Thornton is correct, racism (his employer&rsquo;s racism) motivated him to do what he did. A Latin term used in the legal community is ipse dixit (he himself said it). How is it that a fair minded person can incriminate Omar Thornton for what he did; yet, absolve the Hartford Distributors for their alleged racist conduct? If there was no shooting spree, many have suggested that he could have used the administrative process to report the racism. What that indicates is that many actually believe Omar had enough to file a complaint. Otherwise, why suggest filing a complaint when you don&rsquo;t believe anything happened? That would be a futile gesture. It also suggests that a large population of people believe Mr. Thornton was subjected to racism. Normally, it&rsquo;s the employer that recommends that the employee receive help with a problem that affects his/her job performance. In this case, it could be the employer who needs help with its entrenched racist practices toward African-Americans. {snip} According to Omar Thornton, racism directly contributed to his shooting spree.</p>
<p>In a company that quickly identifies people by color, Hartford Distributors knew that its employees recognized which color was in the minority and the majority. The 911 tape is replete with descriptions of Omar Thornton being Black and one caller adds that he is the only Black guy that works there. The racism herein may have been cloaked in secrecy and a higher mind and set of eyes are reviewing the evidence in this case to find it. {snip}<br>

		<p>This whole article is a prime example of anti-white racism. It assumes without any significant evidence, other than hearsay, that because there were few black employees that the workplace has to be racist since there were a majority of whites. If the European-Americans were organized like the other minorities are, this newspaper would be boycotted and have its advertising ended until the columnist who wrote this was fired.</p>

		<p>What the hell kind of paper is the New York Examiner? I presume its main function is to line the bottom of bird cages, wrap fish or perhaps we might find it on the supermarket shelf next to the Charmin.  What passes for journalism these days?  It simply boggles my mind and if I didn&rsquo;t know any better I&rsquo;d swear I just woke up in the Twilight Zone.</p>
<p>No hard evidence of anythng yet, only the rantings of a homicidal manic on a 911 call and some half-wit decides to write a story about racism?  Good Lord.  I guess if you just use the magic word &#8220;Racism&#8221; it really doesn&rsquo;t matter what follows, it will make a headline somewhere.</p>
<p>How much you want to bet Omar decide to use the magic word as preparation for his criminal defense in case he couldn&rsquo;t fire the final bullet and made it out alive.</p>
<p>Watch for Maxine Waters and Charlie Rangel to start pulling out the magic word to make the corruption charges go away.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that people being stalked and shot by a gunman would be so utterly politically incorrect as to tell police the description of the gunman.  These people should have just told police that a human being was expressing his righteous rage against institutional racism.  </p>

		<p>This article is nuts.  The killer had many other options besides murder.  He could have terminated his employment, filed a complaint, worked to earn respect from fellow workers, seeked counseling.  The blame does not lie with the employer.  If the employer was truly racist, he did not need to hire blacks.  Omar was a criminal to start with.  He was stealing from his employer on a regular basis.  Instead of facing the music, he acted like a coward.  The employer was not going to even press charges if he would just leave.  The employer took the termination process of this character seriously enough that they did not just hand him a pink slip but had three witnesses in termination process.  The employer knew that the firing of blacks had to be handled in a careful manner otherwise there would a lawsuit seeking discrimination damages. </p>

<p>Well, that will teach them a lesson about hiring a black.  But ALL companies, plus the U.S. government, the Census, all college and universities, schools, birth certificates, etc., etc., etc., note the race of individuals and in most cases, makes a real big deal about it.  So what does a 911 description where race is used as a normal identifier prove?</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to build a case against the company through making common and institutionalized practices like racial and ethnic ID an exceptional issue because an otherwise all white company noticed he was black.  What utter trash&hellip;</p>

		<p>The worst crime in politically correct white chritian countries is to be a white male racist. Anything and everything can and will be used to used to ensure our destruction. The &#8220;precipitous decline of the white male&#8221; is trumpeted as a victory by some whites themselves. </p>
<p>Nothing is ever simple, there is always some convoluted reason that white racist men are the reason for everything bad that happens. I shoot you, I&rsquo;m bad. No wait, the evil white man made me do it. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think the United States is going to last too much longer.  When an Hispanic gets 6 votes in Port Chester, NY as another article today states, because all Whites were getting elected, and now talk of the company that Omar Thornton worked for being held accountable for his murder spree, or at least partly accountable, then we are in worse shape than I thought.  I think it was Jared Taylor who predicted that White people will become a hated and hunted minority, and now I&rsquo;m beginning to believe it, because if we project this 20-50 years down the road, it appears that as all these non-White groups gain power they are going to become more and more ruthless with respect to OUR race.  They are not going to show us the same fairness that we showed them.  And the state of White people&rsquo;s awareness of this is:  Condition-critical.  Most White&rsquo;s just go around unconscious of it all or delude themselves that everything will work itself out.  It&rsquo;s not going to work out.  They are taking our jobs, our neighborhoods, our very lives, and most Whites are in La-La land about it.  Somethings got to give.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to say the original article as quoted is unbelievable but, sadly, it is not.</p>
<p>But words like &#8220;delusional&#8221;, &#8220;hateful&#8221;, and &#8220;psychopathic&#8221; certainly apply. Also, &#8220;grammatically challenged&#8221;, &#8220;conceptually challenged&#8221; and &#8220;sub-genius [emphatically!]&#8221;</p>
<p>On one point in particular: &#8220;If Mr. Thornton is correct, racism (his employer&rsquo;s racism) motivated him to do what he did.&#8221; To author Nelson, I would say: what if he isn&rsquo;t correct? What exactly motivated him in that case?</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t rocket science.</p>

		<p>Black irresponsiblity.  Holding black people accountable for their actions is racist according to black people.  Black irresponsiblity is a major theme in black life and many times black people want to pass responsiblity on to white people.  The excuse here is white people made racist comments toward Omar so they are responsible for Omar killing them.  Remember a couple weeks ago, six black teens drowned in a river because they couldn&rsquo;t swim and neither could any of their parents.  A black commentator instead of holding the teens and parents responsible for their reckless behavior placed the responsiblity on to white people and segregation.</p>

		<p>This is incredible piece of garbage by this Nelson is all smoke and mirrors designed to conceal the fact that Omar was nothing more than a thief doing some big time beer stealing. And probably had folks in cahoots with him too. Including perhaps this person alleged to have &#8220;seen&#8221; the evidence.</p>

		<p>This is so utterly in defiance of obvious reality that it beggars belief.  I&rsquo;m sixty-seven years old and have lived my life mostly in the Northeast.  In my entire life I&rsquo;ve witnessed one racial slur directed at a black, which occurred in high school and which caused the offender to pleadingly beg the forgiveness of the victim of his racial slur.  This would have been around 1958-59.</p>
<p>Certainly, whites among themselves are not reticent about expressing less than complimentary opinions about blacks, or Asians or Jews, for that matter.  Nor they about us.  But as a matter of normal discourse between the races, racial slurs simply don&rsquo;t happen anymore in America, excepting those offered by blacks to whites, such as honkey, cracker, etc. The simple fact is that blacks and whites, in their normal interface with one another, exchange jokes and pleasantries and are in every way civil to each other.  Suggestions to the contrary are simply malicious fabrications, which all too many whites feel obligated to pretend that they believe.</p>
<p>The murderer in question in this case is simply a not-too-bright liar, seeking to capitalize on the often-accepted fabrication that racial maltreatment made him a murderous psychotic.</p>

		<p>How disgraceful is it, and how far down a country has degenerated, when a murderer and thief can kill people because he was caught in the act, yet concentration on the incident revolves around a feeble, unsupported lie that he committed murder because he was a victim, rather than a thief who was outed for his thieving ways?</p>

<p>&#8220;In a company that quickly identifies people by color, Hartford Distributors knew that its employees recognized which color was in the minority and the majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>WHAT??? Please read that one again! What does this mean exactly??? Of COURSE, people will recognize which race happens to be a minority or majority&rsquo;! That goes without saying! </p>
<p>&#8220;The 911 tape is replete with descriptions of Omar Thornton being Black and one caller adds that he is the only Black guy that works there.&#8221; </p>
<p>Again, so what? It&rsquo;s a 911 call. The caller is simply describing the attacker! </p>

<p>A &#8220;higher mind&#8221; is reviewing the evidence? Well, thank God, we don&rsquo;t want any of us &#8220;lower minded&#8221; people looking at the evidence! Only a &#8220;higher mind&#8221; will be able to properly find the racism which was &#8220;cloaked in secrecy!&#8221;</p>

		<p>As a general test for the whole tenor of this article, magine if someone wrote a piece about Charles Manson and tried to argue seriously in his article that &#8220;it was the hatred and venom of Sharon Tate directed at Charles Manson that was the real cause of the murder&#8221;.<br>
 Yes, that&rsquo;s the utterly, utterly moral sick and twisted discourse that exists in the *mainstream* American media these days, a media that is morally depraved and evil as Thornton himself.<br>
 &#8220;Depraved&#8221; - meaning that sickness and evil are not merely excused and not sanctioned, but hero-worshipped and lauded, is the right word to use.<br>
 Just what does that tell you about the general state of American society, what future can a society have if moral repugnance and evil is taken as the highest virtue?<br>

		<p>As I wrote before, if employers such as Hartford Distributors are so irredeemaibly hostile and hateful towards black employees - to the point that blacks are &#8216;justified&rsquo; in murdering co-workers and &#8216;forced&rsquo; to take their own lives, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for everyone if Hartford Distributors simply refused to hire blacks in the first place?</p>

		<p>Gee, I wonder if I could use the anti-White racism I suffered during my employment with the Postal Service as the reason I was compelled to retire earlier than I wanted too.  I missed out on a $15,000 buy-out that came 1 year after I left.  I&rsquo;m struggling financially because of the 32% cut in income resultant of my untimely retirement.  But, I doubt that I would have much of a legal case.  I&rsquo;m just the wrong color in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In a company that quickly identifies people by color&#8221;</p>
<p>As opposed to how blacks think of the world, and particularly themselves? They are consumed, eaten up by prefacing everything about themselves as black, first and foremost. Nothing they say about themselves or anyone else comes without either &#8216;black&rsquo; or &#8216;white&rsquo; in front of it. Their color is the be-all and end-all of their world, and is more important in their attitude than any other thing in existence. They are BLACK males, BLACK drivers, BLACK Americans, BLACK employees, BLACK customers, BLACK victims, on and on. Their entire vision of the world is simply black and white; or, more accurately, black vs white. Omar Thornton, the  bottom feeding, garden-variety thief&rsquo;s extensive communication about this incident was nothing BUT &#8216;race, race, race.&rsquo; Racism MADE him steal? Twisted logic, but common.</p>
<p>So you say the company he worked for quickly identified people by race?  Edward Nelson, you are as abnormally consumed by your blackness as the dead thief.</p>

		<p>We could look at this situation from a differnt perspective. What probably happened and no one is going to talk about because it would not be politically correct. </p>
<p>First Thornton was probably an affirmative action hire. He was wasn&rsquo;t qualified or couldn&rsquo;t pass a background check but the company was forced to hired him simply because he is black. They know they can&rsquo;t get rid of him and Thornton knows this to. They try to make the best of a bad situation by letting Thornton load trucks but he sees this as racism. He develops a bad attitude and doesn&rsquo;t get along with his fellow workers, they don&rsquo;t like him because he has a bad attitude but Thornton sees this as just more racism. His bad atttitude gives him the right to steal from the company and now they have this on tape and can finally get rid of Thornton and all he sees is the ultimate racism. </p>
<p>I have noticed that if a black or any other raced person goes to work with an all white crew they can normally get along pretty well if the just do their job and don&rsquo;t cause any trouble. He may not be invited home for dinner or out for a beer but he is not harassed in any way. The days of putting up nooses is long in the past, employees can be fired for such actiion and they know it. They may not like working with blacks but the keep their mouths shut and grin and bear it. </p>
<p>These days blacks are better protected by law than Bald Eagles. You can&rsquo;t legally kill a bald eagle but you can at least call it names and are not forced to work with it. </p>

		<p>I have a feeling Edward Nelson of the New York Examiner will have a different slant on the case where a white man is running around the nation stabbing and killing black men.I doubt it will be black racism and racist as an  &ldquo;accomplice&rdquo;.I don&rsquo;t think it is black racism that causes a white man to kill blacks.I think it is logical to believe it is a deranged mind or pure evil. I also think it was Thorntons twisted sick mind that caused him to kill white co-workers.Lets all stay tuned to see what the hate whitey race hucksters have to say about both cases. </p>

<p>Luckily, you don&rsquo;t have to play your hunch.  There is evidently a white or Middle Eastern serial killer running around Flint, Michigan and now Northern Virginia.  Of the 15 men he has either killed or tried to kill in Flint, all but two have been black, and 5 actually died, all of those black.  In Northern Virginia, Leesburg and Loudoun County specifically, he is suspected to have attacked three men, two blacks by stabbing and one blackish Hispanic with a hammer, but all three will survive.  Meaning his attack count is up to 18, against men between the ages of 15 and 70 who are either frail, elderly or small in stature, and by themselves.</p>
<p>And, without his being captured, without knowing his racial identity for sure (since he seems to be from Michigan, the Middle Eastern thing seems logical), without any real investigation into his life&rsquo;s history, since they don&rsquo;t have him yet, the MSM and the lefty media have pretty much declared them hate crimes and him a hate criminal, and the Leesburg cops are &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to the NAACP (which cheered on Shirley Sherrod pre-&#8220;epiphany&#8221; and knowingly cavorts with blatant anti-white bigots).  Also, since two of his victims are white, that might put a fly in the ointment of the pre-written narrative.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Belleville Bus Beatings &#8220;aren&rsquo;t hate crimes, for a lack of evidence&#8221; (that would take all of five minutes to find), the Christian-Newsom murders &#8220;aren&rsquo;t hate crimes,&#8221; (in spite of the evidence being as obvious as washed-up oil on the shore), and we could go on and on.  Law enforcement have reached out to no white advocacy groups for comfort and console.</p>

		<p>37 Interesting Times:</p>
<p>Other than the fact that the man was stark-raving mad, that was the obvious flaw in Charles Manson&rsquo;s millenarian thinking  &mdash;  On the one hand, he expected black Americans just one day all of a sudden out of the blue to &ldquo;rise up&rdquo; to commit extremely atrocious multiple and constant mass murders against whites, but then once they had successfully wiped whitey off the face of the Earth, they would come crying and boo-hooing to Manson and his &ldquo;family&rdquo; who had &ldquo;outsmarted&rdquo; the genius revolutionaries by hiding out with his 144,000-strong &#8220;family&#8221; in Death Valley, and ask him and his &ldquo;family&rdquo; to run the world because they couldn&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>First off, if the blacks were smart enough to overthrow white society and commit genocide against whites, what would they need Manson and his rag-tag band of vagabonds for?  Second, if the black revolutionaries had it in them to go to every corner of the world where there was white people and kill them all, does one honestly think they wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;clean up&rdquo; Death Valley, too?  Manson&rsquo;s thinking became even more contradictory, because the reason he ordered his minions to commit the Hinman, Tate and Lo Bianco murders is because Manson got tired of waiting on the blacks to get things started, and he &ldquo;wanted to show them how it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;  Show them how it&rsquo;s done?  And he expected THEM to take over the world?<br>

		<p>According to Edward Nelson it&rsquo;s justified to kill people if they are racist.  No doubt this is the same lunatic thinking that drove Omar Thornton to mass murder.  Writing a article this far off from any reasonable amount of sanity proves that Edward Nelson needs help before he winds up doing something really bad.  The management of the New York Examiner really needs to take a close look at this sick individual before it&rsquo;s too late.  All the warning signs are there. However if this trashy article was approved by The New York Examiner editors for publishing it would make them just as bad.  Hmmm! now that I think of it maybe they had to approve this twisted diatribe or they themselves would be called &#8220;racist&#8221;.  It would be called &#8220;affirmative publishing&#8221;.          </p>

<p>While he is a citizen of that country in question, he is not of that ethnicity.  He is described as a Christian Arab.  And now that it&rsquo;s found that it&rsquo;s not someone who looks like you and me stabbing random solitary black men in the back or arms, or hitting them with hammers, the media are downplaying everything they said before about racist hate crimes, drumming up the (true) fact that he attacked two white men in Flint, Michigan, (his current residence), and they&rsquo;re even describing him as a &#8220;serial stabber,&#8221; while yesterday he was a &#8220;serial killer.&#8221;<br>

<p>&ldquo;In a company that quickly identifies people by color&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
You mean like the 96% of African Americans who voted the &#8216;Bama way in &#8216;08? All but a measly 4% of blacks identify political candidates by color and then &#8220;vote their skin&#8221;   &mdash;   is THAT not racist also? </p>
<p>It is a sad fact of life that I&rsquo;m having to learn to accept: that blacks with normal, innocuous American names like &#8220;Edward Nelson&#8221; can be just as deranged and dangerous as those with the more, shall we say, <i>extravagant</i> monikers with the Q&rsquo;s and the apostrophes and suchlike. In short, a significant portion of Af-Ams strike me as being either (a) seriously dim-witted; (b)seriously insane; or (c) some combination of the two. </p>
