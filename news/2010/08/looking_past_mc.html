			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Wong, Politico, Aug. 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Few expect John McCain to pick up the torch again for immigration reform, especially since the Arizona senator took such a hard right turn on the issue to beat back a conservative primary challenge from J.D. Hayworth this week.</p>
<p>But Hispanic- and immigration-rights activists say McCain isn&rsquo;t the only senator who could serve as the Republican standard-bearer for immigration reform.</p>
<p>For one, they haven&rsquo;t given up on Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who endorsed a reform plan this year but recently caused a national uproar after saying the children of illegal immigrants should not receive birthright citizenship under the Constitution.</p>
<p>Activists also are continuing to court Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), who replaced the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, the liberal stalwart who had partnered with McCain on a failed 2007 reform package that included a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the U.S.</p>
<p>And they say Florida&rsquo;s three-way Senate contest between Republican Marco Rubio, Democrat Rep. Kendrick Meek and Republican-turned-independent Gov. Charlie Crist could produce a credible voice and champion for immigration issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But by McCain&rsquo;s 2008 presidential bid, the &#8220;maverick&#8221; had abandoned any talk of comprehensive reform, instead saying the federal government needed to first secure the border.</p>
<p>He returned to that message again this year  &mdash;  endorsing Arizona&rsquo;s tough new immigration law and urging Washington to &#8220;complete the danged fence&#8221;  &mdash;  as he fended off a challenge from immigration hawk Hayworth, a former congressman and conservative talk radio host.</p>
<p>The strategy worked. McCain routed Hayworth by a 25 percent margin, setting up a contest with little-known Democrat Rodney Glassman, a former Tucson City Council member, in November&rsquo;s general election.</p>
<p>McCain has shown no sign of backing away from his hard-line stance on immigration, even after dispatching Hayworth. &#8220;We will secure our borders,&#8221; McCain said at his victory speech in Phoenix Tuesday night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that has become clear about John McCain is he will say and do everything he needs to do to stay in the good graces of voters,&#8221; said Fernand Amandi, vice president of Bendixen &amp; Associates, a Florida-based Latino polling and communications firm. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While many believe McCain is a lost cause on reform, GOP strategist Ana Navarro hasn&rsquo;t written off one of the senator&rsquo;s closest allies, Graham, who rolled out a reform proposal with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in March that included a path to citizenship for the nation&rsquo;s estimated 12 million illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maine&rsquo;s two Republican senators  &mdash;  Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins  &mdash;  remain possibilities as well, though Conda highlighted a political reality: &#8220;The universe for supporters of immigration reform is pretty small.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said he expects Republicans  &mdash;  even McCain  &mdash;  to soften their stances on immigration as the November general election approaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are open to additional conversations with adults in the Republican Party who want to find an immigration solution,&#8221; Noorani said. &#8220;The [political] environment and their positions will continue to change over the next four to six months because all of these candidates are looking at a completely different voting population than they were yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>That may be most apparent in the Senate race in Florida, where Latinos comprise about 13 percent of voters, according to a recent study by America&rsquo;s Voice. More than 1.2 million Latinos cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election, an 80 percent increase from the 2000 election.</p>
<p>Meek, a four-term Democratic congressman, has been a staunch supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Crist, the former Republican running as an independent, backs a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, saying it will keep Social Security solvent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rubio, the Cuban-American tea party darling, is harder to read on immigration. He&rsquo;s said he had concerns about Arizona&rsquo;s hard-line immigration law and does not support changes to the 14th Amendment, but he opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>I think they&rsquo;re dead wrong about McCain and that he&rsquo;s just waiting to be safely reelected before coming back over to the dark side.  However, if they can&rsquo;t pass a &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; bill with a majority Democrat Congress and a Democrat President, the prospects of doing it with an expected Republican majority, with many of the Bush era politicians being flushed down the toilet, are dim.  </p>

		<p>Whites would be foolish to cross their fingers and wait for something sensible to come out of this crowd. Just in case, it would be better to help advance the modern white movement. Support white organizations and try to introduce whites you know to our cause. Growing pressure from whites might get politicians to do the right thing, otherwise whites will be better positioned to become our own ethnic group to help us deal with the coming deluge.</p>

		<p>McCain is 74 years old and this is probably his last term, or at least last full term, in the Senate.  He knows this. He will do what ever it takes to screw the Amercan people for not making him President.  This is the revenge term.  Teddy K was extra awful during his final run and from what I have read, in private he admitted he knew exactly how bad his policies were for white America but did it anyway. Men like Kennedy, McCain and the Bushes have a pathological hatred for America and her people.  The question is &#8220;why&#8221;?</p>

		<p>A message to the voters of Arizona - and to every other state that is cursed with one of these RINO, white genocide promoting weasels: Start immediately to prepare and organize for a recall and at the first sign of ANY treachery out of these flip-flopping, arrogant, backstabbing politicians - begin the recall process and throw them out of office.  McCain is not to be trusted; the guy is one of the most treasonous and treacherous creeps in the entire nation and he needs to be kept in a constant state of fear of voter backlash.    And, I agree with the other poster - he will revert back to his pro-amnesty treason, because the money behind this fink is bound and determined to complete their genocide of the European majority and the destruction of white, Western civilization.  This is clearly a race war being waged against the white majority and these forces are not about to abandon their &#8216;Final Solution&rsquo; for our people simply because we are starting to wake up to their agenda.  If anything, they see us waking up - and therefore will likely try to increase their efforts before we can vote out these traitors and replace them with pro-White Nationalist leaders.   Hence, the key word is:  vigilance.<br>

		<p>The Republicans need a presidential candidate who has a clear, consistent stand on driving out illegals and preventing the entrance of more.  Most, if not all, of the pols mentioned in this article have waffled or have proposed solutions like &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; that could mean anything in the crunch.  Our number-one priority should be illegal immigration.  If it continues, we will become a third-world nation, and then nothing we do will remedy any other problems.  <br>
The recent election shows the power of the people when they simply vote.  Let the MSM howl that we&rsquo;re hateful, that we&rsquo;re racists, Nazis, or whatever they want.  Let them paint Tom Tancredo or any other hardliner as a nut.  We can elect him or anyone else we want!</p>

		<p>The Republican Party exists in order to advance the economic interests of the richest ten percent of the population.  If you keep that in mind, you will never be surprised by what Republican politicians do.<br>
 <br>
A high rate of immigration means more consumers and more job applicants.  By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits.  <br>
 <br>
In his book What is the Matter with Kansas? Thomas Frank said Republicans love to lose on social issues.  Such defeats anger lower income whites, and reinforce their loyalty to the GOP. </p>

		<p>@6,</p>
<p>You are so right Mr. Engelman.  Which is why the real &#8216;reform&rsquo; must begin politically:</p>
<p>1.  All candidacy outside financial support must _stop_.<br>
2.  All candidates must issue a basic platform statement which <br>
    is argued _specifically_ against by other candidates in not <br>
    less than three public debates.  It might be nice if at <br>
    least half of the platform issues are dictated by the <br>
    constituency.<br>
3.  No candidate may vote on any issue which involves his own <br>
    state.  For or against.  Let the commercial interests revert <br>
    to state only control.<br>
4.  Instead of recall, every candidate must be held accountable <br>
    to the platform promises he/she agreed were &#8216;mine&rsquo; to <br>
    advocate or rescind.  In the form of a yearly vote of <br>
    confidence.  If they fail to hold to their promised <br>
    standards, they must be disallowed to vote on that subject, <br>
    more than 30% disagreement with their planned initiatives <br>
    should lead to automatic impeachment.<br>
5.  All specific legislation must be voted on individually.  OR <br>
    line-item veto must be made Constitutionally viable.  Also, <br>
    all legislative motions must be _specifically_ identified <br>
    with their supporters on a weekly basis, with online updates <br>
    of the Legislator&rsquo;s &#8216;opinions&rsquo; on their own websites.  So <br>
    that amendments can be tracked back to their specific <br>
    supporters, early on.<br>
6.  We must make anti-deficiency a high felony with the <br>
    immediate goal of bringing debt spending under control.  At <br>
    least seven years per offense.<br>
7.  Every damn one of these yahoos had better be in their chairs <br>
    debating on every single piece of legislation for which they <br>
    cast a vote.  If 90% of the Senate&rsquo;s bill signings go <br>
    through without debate or personal vote, then THAT is the <br>
    source of your pork.  Attendance should also be mandatorily<br>
    reported on the website.  Is this high school?  Do we have <br>
    to have truancy officers?<br>
8.  Every national representative should be paid equivalent to <br>
    their roles in the civilian economic world.  At least 2-4 <br>
    million a year.<br>
9.  At the same time, it should also be a high felony (10 years, <br>
    at least) to be caught accepting ANY kind of gratuity, job <br>
    offer or &#8216;speaking tour&rsquo; ANY -interested party- for the <br>
    duration of the Legislator&rsquo;s career in office and at least <br>
    ten more years afterward.<br>
10. The President should not have to beg.  If he believes in <br>
    something, he should be flat out given a small budget to <br>
    instigate whatever program or effort he feels this nation <br>
    needs to better itself.  As research.<br>
11. Lame Duck mulishness must go.  Either return to the <br>
    President full powers of reelection to the limit of his/her <br>
    fitness.  Or make sure that the ENTIRE government suffers <br>
    the same term limit restriction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the people we have to worry about folks.  It&rsquo;s the issues they champion and the legal environment they operate in.</p>

		<p>Arzonans had a chance to get a true pro-white candidate in.  Hayworth is the kind of politician we need throughout the country.  He&rsquo;s fearless and he&rsquo;s not afraid to tell it like it is.</p>
<p>Putting McCain back in to continue to work against us tells us that the whites in this country are too naive and spineless to elect strong white leaders.  This is the same man who wants to ban all herbs and vitamins, but was forced to withdraw his support of the bill in order to get re-elected, the same reason he has pretended to be a non-supporter of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>These McCain voters deserves EXACTLY what they&rsquo;re going to get.</p>

<p>HEADLINE: Looking Past McCain on Immigration</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m confident most readers of AR have long been in the habit of looking past Juan McCain on just about every subject. </p>
<p>RINOs like McCain are Yesterday&rsquo;s Men. Who Tomorrow&rsquo;s Man (or Woman) is, has yet to be determined. But the fact that Juan McCain is Yesterday&rsquo;s Man is irrefutable. </p>
<p>So just run out the clock on your final term, Senator   &mdash;   and then it&rsquo;s <i>adios</i> to you and everybody who thinks like you (including your bimbo RINO daughter)!</p>
<p>Arizona Rising   &mdash;   Like a Phoenix!</p>
