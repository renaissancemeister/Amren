			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dennis Prager, Townhall, August 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The title of this column seems unbelievable, but it is in fact what happened in America this past week. And almost no one has noticed.</p>
<p>After 50 years of being inundated with stories of white racism, and being taught in college that in this white-dominated society, only a white can be a racist, the American public has been properly brainwashed into accepting the otherwise incredible: A black man murdered eight white people at his place of work because they were white, and the media story is about the murderer&rsquo;s alleged experiences of racism.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Associated Press Report from Aug. 7, four days after the murders. It was reprinted in The Washington Post and throughout America:</p>
<p>&#8220;To those closest to him, Omar Thornton was caring, quiet and soft-spoken.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But underneath, Thornton seethed with a sense of racial injustice for years that culminated in a shooting rampage Tuesday in which the Connecticut man killed eight and wounded two others at his job at Hartford Distributors in Manchester before killing himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know what pushed him over the edge was all the racial stuff that was happening at work,&rsquo; said his girlfriend, Kristi Hannah.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He always felt like he was being discriminated (against) because he was black,&rsquo; said Jessica Anne Brocuglio, his former girlfriend. &#8216;Basically they wouldn&rsquo;t give him pay raises. He never felt like they accepted him as a hard working person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thornton changed jobs a few times because he was not getting raises, Brocuglio said.&#8221;</p>
<p>The New York Times Aug. 3 headline read: &#8220;Troubles Preceded Connecticut Workplace Killing,&#8221; and in the second paragraph, the Times reported:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Aug. 7, 2010, The Washington Post headline read, &#8220;Beer warehouse shooter long complained of racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, Thornton was fired for stealing beer, and there was video proof of him doing so. But this fact  &mdash;  the one indisputable and most pertinent pre-murder fact  &mdash;  got lost within the larger context of Thornton&rsquo;s claims of being a victim of whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [T]he liberal media, i.e., almost all news media in America, does not brand these Connecticut murders for what they are: racist. That is why Thornton told the 9-1-1 operator, &#8220;I wish I could have gotten more of the people (i.e., whites).&#8221;</p>
<p>We are repeatedly told by liberal whites and blacks that America needs an honest dialogue on race. Needless to say, they don&rsquo;t mean it because the moment a white or black says anything critical of black behavior, he is labeled racist or Uncle Tom. So most non-liberal whites and blacks just keep quiet.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One terrible consequence of this liberal attitude toward black violent crime is that too many blacks come to believe that less is expected of them morally than from whites. And the truth is that most Americans on the left do expect less from blacks.</p>
<p>But saying any of this gets us nowhere because it is simply labeled racism. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, check leftist reactions to this column on the Internet.</p>

<p>Less <i>is</i> expected of blacks, but it&rsquo;s not because of some &#8220;liberal attitude,&#8221; pernicious as liberal attitudes generally are.  It&rsquo;s because of the <i>actions</i> of blacks themselves.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;And the truth is that most Americans on the left do expect less from blacks.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So do amerikans on the right.  But unlike the hand-wringing left, we aren&rsquo;t afraid to admit it.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But saying any of this gets us nowhere because it is simply labeled racism.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Then stop living in fear of being called a Racist, and accept reality.  <i>Then</i> and only then can we begin to make some progress.</p>

		<p>Prager is always right-on.</p>
<p>He is not a Christian; he is jewish.</p>
<p>That shows me that there is something BEYOND religion that makes for righteousness and common sense. </p>
<p>Or, conversely, that becoming a Christian, or a member of any religion, does not give one rightness, or righteousness.</p>
<p>No, it is hard-earned.</p>

		<p>There was no hard evidence for anti-black racism yet the media takes it and runs with it. There is simply no solution to our racial problems with the current establishment in the media, academia, politics, courts and schools. Whites - and others - are always blamed for the failings of blacks.</p>

		<p>In Rochester, New York, last night, a 30 year old black guy, a  passenger, jumped out of a van at an intersection, and punched a 50 year old white motorcyclist in the face, taunting and threatening him.  The white guy pulled out his licensed pistol and shot the black guy.  Guess who got arrested.  (The white guy, in case you didn&rsquo;t figure it out.) Guess who is being portrayed as the aggressor.</p>

		<p>It seems that Thornton, the poor discriminated against Black man had not just one White girlfriend, but TWO.  If the name &#8220;Jessica Anne Brocuglio&#8221; is any indication then she is White.  In all my life I&rsquo;ve never seen such miscegenation going on.  And it always seems to be White women with Blonde hair WITH Black men.  And they almost always have &#8220;bleeding hearts&#8221;.  It is unbelievable how this media conditions the minds of young impressionable White girls and women to date men of other races, especially Blacks.  </p>

		<p>The left needs to experience black racist, anti-white violence every day for years, before it would ever sink in to their Neanderthal-type brains that they might have been wrong all along.</p>
<p>I can visualize a situation where aware whites who have been well-armed and prepared, are in an enclave where they are numerous enough and militarily strong enough to repel bands of marauding blacks, looking to loot from and kill whitey. And, at some point, they are confronted with desperate pleas by leftist journalists to be allowed into the protection of the white enclave, because their numbers have suffered so many attacks by blacks they know full-well it&rsquo;s only a matter of time, before their eliminated to the last person.</p>
<p>And I can visualize them being turned away and spat upon with curses, letting them know they brought the situation on themselves, so it is only fair they deal with it on their own.</p>
<p>They would not get entry from many of us, but I would be in favor of giving them signs to appeal to the black gangs making their positions known before the balloon went up:  &#8220;I was a Huffington Post Subscriber;  I worked for MSNBC;  I was a regular poster on the Daily Kos, Move On.org, etc.; I was a loyal Obama supporter; I was always a self-hating white; I always hoped the perp in all bombings was white so non-whites wouldn&rsquo;t be thought to be bad people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, if they evaded blacks for long enough they could always sit around a campfire at night and eat their signs.</p>

		<p>I strongly suggest people here take a basic, fair, no nonsense approach to Black crime.</p>
<p>Most Whites in America do not hate Black people, or other non Whites. They can&rsquo;t much understand all the intellectual division or wild conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>But, the can understand good and bad, right from wrong.</p>
<p>Black criminals are bad  and bad doesn&rsquo;t mean good.</p>
<p>Most White Americans will oppose the anti White MSM - Mainstream Media attempts to spin terrible Black on White crimes.</p>
<p>In this instance, we made a music video on the Thornton murders of 8 of his White co-workers.</p>
<p>The theme is basic, easy to understand:</p>
<p>Black criminals are Bad- no good.</p>
<p>Stop making excuses for bad, no good Black criminals.</p>

		<p>If I may, just a few points to consider:</p>
<p>1.  I really hate to think what the families of the murdered victims are going through, not only due to their tragic losses of loved ones but also because of the lies spewed forth by the lame-stream-media.  Does anyone in the so-called MSM have anything to say about those who were murdered?</p>
<p>2. I don&rsquo;t think Whites are going to turn and fight (literally or figuratively). I&rsquo;d like to think we would, but I&rsquo;m not optimistic.  We&rsquo;ve become so brainwashed by more than 50 years of liberal nonsense that it may be hopeless for us.  The liberals have achieved many of their goals. Among these, they have taken public education so low that a populace dumbed-down big time can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s going on in time to oppose it. </p>
<p>3. Many of us posting on AmRen can&rsquo;t agree; we can&rsquo;t even agree to disagree.  How are we going to stick together and fight, in conference rooms or on the battlefield, if it comes to that?  This isn&rsquo;t 1861 folks.</p>

<p>Like I always said, there are many Jews in America so you could blame them.<br>
But here in Europe there are nearly no Jews at all! And the politicians and the media are much worse than in America. The only Jew in a big position is Sharkozy and he was frequently called far-right and racist because he wants to fight criminal immigrants.</p>

		<p>  To German #6. I don&rsquo;t know which Europe you live in but let me give you a few examples.In Britain there is Mendelson, Straw and others,France has Sarkozy,Kuchner,Veil and many others,in fact France has 700,000 Jews.The ex  socialist prime minister of Hungary was a Jew.In Greece there is George Papandreou,Kostas Simitis an ex prime minister and a few others. There are plenty of examples in Germany and other countries. So to say there are few Jews in Europe is quite ludicrous.</p>

		<p>Prager&rsquo;s column is of course accurate. It may be &#8220;too little, too late&#8221; but at least someone outside of Amren is publishing such thoughts. The mainstream media has a template which they will not stray from. In this template, blacks must always be portrayed as victims. Any news event which does not fit the template, is either ignored or grossly distorted, in order to make it fit. All readers of Amren know this. It is our job (as readers of Amren) to make everyone we know, similarly aware (our relatives, friends &amp; neighbors). These circumstances embolden black criminals to commit crimes against whites. It is going to get worse&hellip;much worse. In many parts of this once great country; it already is like a Somali war zone. Take heed and be prepared.</p>

<p>Having been part of the great academic brainwashing machine, I totally agree with Dennis Prager. Whites are so afraid of being labeled racist that they will put up with any indignity or absurdity. College educated whites are a very sick, self-hating class.</p>
<p>Will we ever wake up? I guess we here at AR just have to keep trying to wake the sleep-walkers.</p>

<p>Jack, <br>
Good video but you should have included the pictures of the Karr brothers, the killers of Channon and Christopher, the murderer of Anne Pressley etc. <br>
We have got to awaken the &#8221; Sleeping Giant&#8221; (as Admiral Yamamoto said) that IS  the White people of the US. We lost hundreds of thousands in a Civil War for the  purpose of  ending slavery (according to the left),  we struggled through the Civil Rights era to ensure equal opportunity and we&rsquo;ve scacrificed tens of thousands of our own on the PC altar of murder, rape, rape AND murder and various other forms of violence; all to absolutely NO avail.<br>
I think one of the main things that needs to be done is an all out assault on the MSM.  They need to be made to tell the truth about what&rsquo;s going on in this country. Every White person in the US needs to stop watching the Big 3 and any of the other so  called news networks who constantly sweep the truth under the carpet. Our clock is ticking.<br>
I send AM to every person I know. Everyone who reads this should inform  the networks that we&rsquo;ll  stop supporting them them.</p>

		<p>The public has NOT been &#8220;properly brainwashed&#8221; into believing liberal hocum, as this article states!  Get a bunch of non-black working-class folks around the water cooler and see just how much of the leftist swill they buy!  People of any class, in their workplace or in a very public arena, are careful about making race-realist remarks, for fear of being fired or accosted or sometimes of simply giving offense to blacks.  That does not mean a tiny group of pundit silly-nillies has convinced them of anything!  </p>

		<p>A reply to Anonymous, #10  &mdash;  In Christianity, righteousness may be imputed, but it does not necessarily follow that rightness is. </p>
<p>Prager and other men of common sense believe that it is RIGHT to stop illegal immigration, to not tolerate crime, to pay your mortgage, to not live on the public dole, etc. In other words, it is right to be a person of noble character.</p>
<p>I see a few Christian leaders espousing these positions. </p>
<p>Not many,  but a few.</p>
<p>It is the same in every religion and denomination  &mdash;  only a few are right.</p>
<p>I find myself agreeing with Prager more than with, say, Richard Land, or any of the other &#8220;conservatives&#8221; in favor of amnesty. There are other issues as well.</p>
<p>That is why I say that, although &#8220;righteousness&#8221; may be imputed (whatever that could mean), common sense and rightness are NOT!</p>
<p>So where does it come from?</p>

		<p>I wonder how many of those white people that Thornton shot and wounded or murdered has ancestors that fought in the Union Army during the Northern War of Aggression against the South? I can imagine too that either they themselves, or they had relatives that participated in civil rights demonstrations for blacks. After all the majority of whites have always supported blacks and the idea of civil rights for all. <br>
I have told my son as a warning, I know you are not a racist, but blacks don&rsquo;t care. You are a white male, to blacks and others like them, you are a racist. </p>

		<p>This article makes a few things perfectly crystal clear.</p>
<p>Many places in the US, murder of whites is no longer considered much of a crime or even a crime at all.  Authorities will only reluctantly prosecute the blacks.  The media will actively cover up the crime.  Liberal whites who live in the area do not care unless it is one of their family&hellip;even then, any mention of the fact that it was black on white racist violence is not welcome.  They are so crazy in the head that they would rather desecrate the memory of their lost loved one, or simply forget about them, then address the issue of racial violence directed toward them.  If a racialist wants a true lesson in this, simply attempt to post on a victims facebook. Truly, they are fools of they don&rsquo;t immediately pick up and leave the area to protect what is left of their families.</p>
<p>Many areas of the country feel&hellip;..differently.  This is made obvious by the self-defense laws that are passed and how they prosecute black crime.  The best areas make it easy (for a white person) to obtain and carry firearms, have wide latitude for self-defense, and actively shield against lawsuit&hellip;&hellip;meanwhile, criminals are given extremely stiff prison sentences.</p>
<p>This is very important information to know and act on.  If you do not live in such an area&hellip;..move.  This may be difficult.  But it&rsquo;s a priority.</p>
<p>You know what is not a priority?  Protecting white people from black crime, on a federal level and in many states.  Nor is it a priority to organize and manifest white outrage over such things.</p>
<p>Our laws and institutions will not protect us, so we MUST do so ourselves.  In order to do that, you have to live where such behavior won&rsquo;t be actively punished.</p>
<p>Eventually, the US will split along this issue.  You definitely don&rsquo;t want to live in the wrong place when that happens.</p>

<p>Have any of you seen the dietary supplement commercial where a white woman identifies three white men as nasty dietary problems and then identifies the big black man as the fiber solution and she orders the white men out supported by the black man, leaving two white women with the one black man?  My wife and I howl everytime we see this one. <br>

&#8220;The public has NOT been &ldquo;properly brainwashed&rdquo; into believing liberal hocum, as this article states!&hellip; That does not mean a tiny group of pundit silly-nillies has convinced them of anything!&#8221;   &mdash;   oldwhitelady<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I wish I could agree, but I can&rsquo;t. Sorry.  What you say may be true in certain parts of the country or with certain social classes, but not the  country as a whole, regrettably. </p>
<p>As Sardonicus said,  &#8220;College-educated whites are a very sick, self-hating class.&#8221;  Exactly! And that is the result of &#8220;proper brainwashing&#8221;.  But not only the college-educated! Take a stroll through your local Walmart and see all the white women with black men, or single white mommas stuck with with screaming mulattos and NO black daddies anywhere around. The two white girlfriends of this black psychopath provide further proof of this fact. Do you think they are imaginary?  </p>
<p>That &#8220;tiny goup of pundit silly-ninnies&#8221; that you scoff at and disparagingly dismiss as irrelevant constitutes the avant garde of the Frankfurt School in action. They are among those leading the &#8220;long march through the institutions&#8221;. They have made themselves the effective rulers of America. And this is no exaggeration! Do you think their cultural deconstruction has been unimportant?  You think you can laugh them off?  Do you think this social transformation is all uncoordinated and purely by accident?  If so, YOU are the silly one!  </p>
<p>A war is being waged against us, and we are purposely kept in the darkness about it.  In the past 40 years, they have been reconstructing America right under our eyes, to a new Marxist model, and this is everywhere to be seen right in front of us. Just turn on your TV and have a look.  Oh, that&rsquo;s only fantasy, you say?  Well then, take a  good look at the White House!  What do you see there?  Do you think THAT is only fantasy too? </p>
<p>It is the end result of media manipulation and massive  national &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; which has been very thorough and very effective. It is always dangerous to under-estimate your enemy.  Whatever you think of them, these people are not to be dismissed or scoffed at. </p>

<p>When you say &#8220;howl&#8221; I hope you don&rsquo;t mean laugh.  That commercial is actually nothing to laugh at.  It is part of the most insidious race-mixing agenda designed to destroy our race by creating relentless imagery where White men are portrayed as incompetent, untrustworthy, scatter-brained, un-masculine and less intelligent than Blacks and others.  Not only does it condition the minds of young impressionable White girls to bed down with non-White men, but it also conditions young White guys to behave in the pathetic roles that they see not only on TV, but in the movies and advertisements.  I believe that over 95% of the White population are not even aware that they are being subtly conditioned for their own destruction.</p>
