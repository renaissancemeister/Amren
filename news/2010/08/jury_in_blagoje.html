<h1>Jury in Blagojevich Corruption Trial Only Agrees on 2 Counts Out of 24: Judge Says Keep Deliberating</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meena Hartenstein, New York Daily News, August 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Elvis look-alike Rod Blagojevich may soon have a message for the jury in his corruption trial: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>The former Illinois governor was all smiles Thursday as jurors on day 12 of deliberations announced they have hit a wall and can agree on only two out of 24 counts against him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The jurors did not disclose which two counts they did settle but said they haven&rsquo;t even addressed the 11 counts of wire fraud at issue in the case. That implies they are stalled on the remaining 11 counts they have discussed.</p>
<p>Many of the wire fraud charges hinge on phone calls taped by the FBI in which the conversations relate to charges Blagojevich tried to sell or barter President Obama&rsquo;s vacated Senate seat for personal benefit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Judge James Zagel praised the jurors for their work so far but said he would be sending them back to continue deliberations.</p>
<p>If jurors ultimately cannot break their impasse on most counts, prosecutors likely will retry Blagojevich on the charges that left the jury split, Chicago attorney Mark Helfand told The AP.</p>

								<h2>Blagojevich Trial Stalls Jackson Jr.&rsquo;s Aspirations</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Sophia Tareen, Google News, August 5, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Jesse Jackson Jr. once possessed the makings of a political star. Son of a civil rights leader and a Democratic congressman with a strong base of support on Chicago&rsquo;s South Side, he set his sights on becoming the city&rsquo;s mayor, or a senator from Illinois.</p>
<p>Those dreams of higher political office have been dimmed  &mdash;  perhaps irrevocably  &mdash;  by Jackson&rsquo;s association with the corruption case of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. One damaging detail to emerge is that Jackson may have known about supporters&rsquo; plans to raise at least $1 million on the condition that Blagojevich appoint him to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s former Senate seat.</p>
<p>Of all the public figures whose names came up during the trial, Jackson has suffered the most political fallout. These days he keeps a low profile in his district, rarely appearing in public and avoiding the media  &mdash;  especially when it comes to questions about Blagojevich.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no doubt that his ambitions have taken a hit,&#8221; said Roosevelt University political scientist Paul Green. &#8220;Right now all his options are on hold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson, 45, has not been charged and denies wrongdoing, but there&rsquo;s little doubt he remains on the radar of federal prosecutors. A House ethics investigation of him, delayed at prosecutors&rsquo; request, was scheduled to resume after the trial.</p>
<p>While his congressional seat appears safe in the November election  &mdash;  he has won it since 1995 with more than 80 percent of the vote each time  &mdash;  even Jackson&rsquo;s staunchest allies agree his reputation has suffered.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson admitted he was &#8220;Senate Candidate A,&#8221; one of several people Blagojevich considered appointing. According to the criminal complaint, Jackson&rsquo;s supporters were willing to raise more than a million dollars for Blagojevich if he named Jackson to the seat. Jackson denied knowledge of the alleged offers.</p>
<p>At the trial, however, prosecutors said the state&rsquo;s former international trade director, Rajinder Bedi, told them Jackson was present at a meeting when Bedi and a businessman discussed fundraising for Blagojevich and Jackson&rsquo;s desire for the seat. During testimony, when prosecutors indicated Bedi was about to describe the incident, the judge cleared jurors from the room.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since the latest associations with Blagojevich, there are inklings that enthusiasm for him is waning in the district. For the first time, the black-owned Kankakee City News has chosen not to support Jackson and instead endorsed his Republican opponent. The publisher cites the Blagojevich association.</p>
<p>However, many believe Jackson won&rsquo;t be permanently tainted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bottom line, I would not take Jesse Jackson out of the calculation,&#8221; said Alan Gitelson, a Loyola University of Chicago political science professor. &#8220;These are the kinds of things you can overcome. Time passes and people change their opinions.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Illinois is my current state of residence, and Blago is the second straight Illinois Governor to be faced with corruption charges.  So, I want to ask the AR community something that is being discussed on various Illinois message boards and Southern Illinois Statehood Movement websites and blogs:  Is having that much power too much for one person?  Should the executive powers of a given state be divided up among several people elected at staggered intervals?  For instance, in a given three-person executive board of the state government, one would have the power to sign or veto laws, one would have the power to grant pardons/commutations, and one would have the power of law enforcement that a given Governor has now.  Each sub-Governor would get a six-year term, one of the three sub-Governors would be up for election every two years.  Additionally, the duties of the various sub-Governors could be rotated among the sub-Governors at given intervals in exchange for longer terms. And of course there would be term limits.</p>

		<p>The investigation may have been ended abruptly due to the fact that JJ Jr was falling into the net. It appears he had an interest in being appointed senator and was in negotiations for it even though, in private, Blagojevich expressed a distaste for him. The federal prosecutor may have saved him from further incrimination. The prosecutor also has only allowed some portions of the secret recordings of the governor to be used in this case despite the public pleadings of Blagojevich for all of them to be publicly aired. I wonder what&rsquo;s there. The case also has some connection to Tony Rezko, who is connected to Obama. Perhaps the prosecutor will get some reward down the road for his sense of discretion.      </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t the U.S. Attorney on that case Patrick Fitzfong, a Republican appointee?  Though a &#8220;Republican&#8221; in Chicago is a Democrat in almost any other place anyway, so the wheeling-dealing you describe might not be in spite of that.</p>

		<p>I believe Blago is being singled out as a &#8220;target&#8221;.  Another White man being targeted because he&rsquo;s White.  The media and government have been demonizing Whites.  This is no surprise.  Selling &#8220;King&#8221; Obama&rsquo;s seat.  Now that&rsquo;s an image of an &#8216;evil White man&rsquo; that they can sell and are selling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not buying though.</p>

		<p>The prosecutor was originally a Republican appointee, but Obama renewed his appointment when it would have ordinarily expired. The Federal prosecutor (Fitzgerald) has been bending over backwards to accommodate Obama and the leaders of the Illinois Democratic Party during this case and withheld testimony from many anticipated witnesses and opted for a minimalist approach to the case in chief. Had the prosecution pressed its case, it should have been a slam dunk. If Blagojevich skates away free, it will because Fitzgerald was reluctant to implicate Obama and his cronies in Chicago and Illinois corruption. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Is having that much power too much for one person?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question seems to imply that good people or at least normal people are somehow corrupted by power and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the way it works at all. Politics has always been corrupt in the United States and it has always drawn the worst elements from the population. In many ways, we are living under a Kakistocracy, i.e. &#8220;government by the least qualified or most unprincipled citizens.&#8221; Blago&rsquo;s just another example of the typical American politician. That&rsquo;s all. If you set up a system of sub-governors, all you&rsquo;re going to end up with is a bunch of corrupt sub-governors. The only solution that I can see is to get rid of these offices altogether. Just do away with them. Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t even notice the difference if we didn&rsquo;t have a president or if my state didn&rsquo;t have a governor. If anything, my financial situation would probably improve without all these bloodsucking politicians taking a cut out of everything I earn.<br>
