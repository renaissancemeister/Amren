			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Fitzgerald, WTTG-TV (Washington, D.C.), August 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck is planning a big rally at the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday. But a Tea Party blogger is drawing critics tonight after his &#8220;Visitors Guide&#8221; to D.C.  &mdash;  warned people to stay out of certain neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods it turns out, that also happen to be home to many African Americans.</p>
<p>Conservative blogger Bruce Majors says he was trying to help. &#8220;I wrote a little blog telling them where it&rsquo;s safe to go, where it&rsquo;s cheap to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that &#8220;little blog&#8221; has created a big controversy  &mdash;  with Majors now facing accusations of racism. Majors says when it comes to his critics these people are &#8220;absolutely insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>At issue is Majors&rsquo; &#8220;Guide to DC Blog &#8221; written for Tea Partiers who&rsquo;ll be going to Glenn Beck&rsquo;s, &#8220;Restoring Honor&#8221; rally Saturday at the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
<p>But along with restaurant and hotel tips Majors says &#8220;it had a list of Metro stops I don&rsquo;t think you should get off on unless you&rsquo;re from D.C.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the blog, Majors wrote that DC has &#8220;refugees from every country&#8221; and that Tea Party visitors who use Metro should stay &#8220;between Union Station and Shady Grove.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People who commented on the blog referred to &#8220;ghetto neighborhoods&#8221; and called D.C. &#8220;more dangerous than Bagdad.&#8221; The neighborhoods mentioned in the blogs are predominately African-American.</p>
<p>Majors denies any racial motive saying, &#8220;In this climate anytime you mention race, if people don&rsquo;t like your politics they&rsquo;re going to call you a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>But some D.C. leaders say they have concerns about the tone of Majors blog and the Tea Party itself. D.C. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton [who is black] says the blog is telling people to stay away from black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week Norton joined other Civil Rights leaders who criticized Glenn Beck for holding a rally on the anniversary of Martin Luther King&rsquo;s &#8220;I Have a Dream Speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were the tea party movement,&#8221; Norton says, &#8220;I&rsquo;d be very careful about what you say given the fact that at least at one time racists have been identified was within the movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing people with these views into our city is extremely bothersome given the fact that this is a peaceful, multiracial city where everybody gets along,&#8221; continued Norton.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Bruce Majors says he knows there was no racial message in his blog and stands by what he wrote saying &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a deliberate political ploy by people who are desperate and who don&rsquo;t have any other ammunition.&#8221;</p>
<p>FROM BRUCE MAJORS BLOG:</p>
<p>Safety and Mores</p>
<p>DC&rsquo;s population includes refugees from every country, as the families of embassy staffs of third world countries tend to stay in DC whenever a revolution in their homeland means that anyone in their family would be in danger if they went back. Most taxi drivers and many waiters/waitresses (especially in local coffee shops like the Bread and Chocolate chain) are immigrants, frequently from east Africa or Arab countries. As a rule, African immigrants do not like for you to assume they are African Americans and especially do not like for you to guess they are from a neighboring country (e.g. Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia) with whom they may have political or military tensions. It&rsquo;s rare to meet anyone who gets really offended, but you can still be aware of the issue.</p>
<p>Many parts of DC are safe beyond the areas I will list here, but why chance it if you don&rsquo;t know where you are?</p>

<p><br>
As a local, let me confirm this - I&rsquo;ve never seen a waitress in my local Bread &amp; Chocolate that wasn&rsquo;t from Ethiopia or a neighboring East African country.  </p>
<p>They often don&rsquo;t speak much English, either.  I had to send a overpriced goat cheese omelet back 4 times in a row because the African waitress thought I was saying &#8220;no cheese omelet&#8221; (there was NOTHING inside).  Finally, in exasperation, I said, &#8220;Why on Earth would you think I&rsquo;d order a &#8216;no cheese omelet&rsquo;, and then keep sending it back for lack of cheese?&#8221;  She looked at me like I was a Martian and said &#8220;No understand.&#8221;  Needless to say, I left and never went back.</p>

		<p>Another example of why the term &#8220;racist&#8221; means NOTHING.  Example #3,234: staying away from violent ghettos is racist.  </p>
<p>Yes, those neighborhoods are violent and dangerous, and yes, it is precisely because they are overwhelmingly BLACK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not poverty, folks.  West Virginia is one of the poorest states, but it&rsquo;s extremely White, so it is not as dangerous as Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Anyone with a lick of sense knows to stay away from black &#8216;hoods.  Even blacks know this to be true!<br>

		<p>Well, gee whiz&hellip;.Doesn&rsquo;t Beck and all his supporters deny they are &#8220;racists&#8221; and welcome blacks into their fold?  Doesn&rsquo;t Beck elevate blacks on his programs and speak highly of the Black Founding Fathers?  Did not the Tea Party say there is no room for WHITE &#8220;racists&#8221; at their rally?  To them any White who is savvy on the race issue and wants to preserve the White race is a &#8220;racist&#8221; and a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; to these dim-witted fools.</p>

		<p>What does it say when Washington, DC, the captial of the American Empire is populated by people from Africa and the Middle East who do not even speak English, share few if any of its cutural values and history, and contains Black &#8220;neighbor&#8221;hoods that are unsafe? Is there any better example why an America founded and built by people from Europe is in precipitous decline. And how appropriate that this growing alien and hostile underclass should share DC with the traitors in the Congress, Whitehouse and Supreme Court.   </p>

<p>Now that is priceless!  Yep, everybody gets along&hellip;.sure they do. As for the &#8220;racists&#8221; (White ones, that is) that the Tea Partyers do not want in their movement, then I suggest they go right ahead and go all over D.C. and mingle amongst all those nonwhites they love so much.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of what I mean when I say the right should learn&hellip;and have the cajones to use&hellip;&hellip;psychological ploys, just as the left does in abundance.</p>
<p>The response by this blogger to charges of racism is to respond with charges of his own, pointing out that whites cannot safely travel in most all black neighborhoods throughout the country without being assaulted or killed.  This is a golden opportunity to get in some really big punishment.  Instead this guy and others meekly attempt to defend themselves against outrageously bogus charges for pointing out how racist most blacks are, so racist in fact they&rsquo;ll attack whites who venture into black neighborhoods for no provocation at all.  </p>
<p>Talk show hosts should bring up whether these charges are true or not.  &#8220;Can whites walk through black neighborhoods without being attacked?&#8221; That should reverberate throughout the country from Rush Limbaugh to Glenn Beck and everybody on Fox News.  </p>
<p>If they want to be stand offish about the topic, they could ask callers to call in with their opinions.  There would be so many instances of blatant black racism blacks would never raise the issue again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really pitiful situation.  Blacks are beating, raping, and murdering whites at unprecedented rates, but to speak of it results in being shouted down as a racist.  It only works on those who are too spineless to stick by their guns and reveal the truth and put the black criminals on the defensive.</p>
<p>The cowards who are applying pressure to avoid the subject are the money mongers behind the conservative media who are fearful they will lose money and audience over sticking up for what is right.  That&rsquo;s really nonsense, because the listening audiences would love it.</p>
<p>Too, politically, the Republican power behind the scenes puts a damper on such tactics, because they&rsquo;re afraid of losing votes.</p>
<p>Rush, Glen, Gordon Liddy, Sean, and most all the rest would let it all hang out if they were not constrained by the cowards behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Conservative power and money influences need to grow a pair and quit inhibiting themselves with the desire to be managers instead of attackers and winners, using as many psychological ploys as they can.</p>
<p>What a BIG difference it would make.</p>
<p>I will say this, however, as the situation gets into out and out vicious beatings and killings, even the power brokers won&rsquo;t be able to hold everybody in check from speaking their minds. </p>
<p>In the end, it looks like the big shots will have to turn off their lights in their gated communities and hide under their beds once the balloon goes up.  </p>

		<p>Bruce Majors apparently is far to insensitive to comprehend the great disservice he has done to the residents of the African-American neighborhoods that he advised visitors to avoid. There are crack dealers in those neighborhoods who have car and child support payments to make who rely on fresh victims for their customers to rob. There are rapists who count on out-of-town visitors to spice up their sex lives. There are prostitutes who can no longer get local business because the neighborhood folks all know that they are carrying the package. Did you think about these people at all before you deprived them of their livelihood?<br>
Is it any wonder the Black D.C. leaders are angry?<br>
Think about all of the people you are going to hurt before you play tour guide again, Mr. Majors. </p>

Have the Black males in Washington D.C. have a criminal record, and most likely a good portion of the remainder are criminal waiting to get caught.  You can&rsquo;t even warn people not to go into unsafe areas and you&rsquo;re labeled a racist.  How much worse is it going to get?</p>

		<p>It is not anyone&rsquo;s business when it comes to telling people where to go. I&rsquo;m sorry Rep. Norton is bothered by the fact that some of her fellow citizens mapped out a visit to DC that excludes certain neighborhoods. What makes her, all of the sudden, the new fascist travel agent?</p>
<p>In any event, the Metro stations to avoid were most likely based on crime statistics rather than race. That they happened to be in black areas, well, that&rsquo;s the way it goes.</p>
<p>Norton should shut her mouth. Why is she so concerned about where Tea Party activists go? She&rsquo;s a moron to begin with but the real issue here is an effort to (again) paint the Tea Party activists and, by extension, Republicans, as racists. It really has become the last refuge of scoundrels when they resort to the racism card.</p>
<p>Lastly, it seems that some blacks don&rsquo;t like the fact that white people are congregating on a day that MLK made a speech. They sound like they &#8220;own&#8221; the day so they get to dictate who does what. Wrong. </p>
<p>I think more and more blacks are seeing whites push back now. They fear a change in government not because of any intelligent political beliefs but that their government giveaways may be cut.</p>

<p>The only problem with Mr. Majors blog is that the thugs will now know where to go to assault the White &#8216;racisss&rsquo;. The new black panthers will see to that. </p>

		<p>Eleanor Norton Holmes would rather not have this rally in D.C. at all.  One of the bloggers who is part of the rally is telling people coming to it to avoid certain D.C. neighborhoods and public transit stops populated by people who look a lot like Eleanor Norton Holmes.  She should actually be happy about this development, for the people she dislikes so much will be nowhere near the thriving black ghettos.</p>

		<p>My mother lived in the Anacostia area of SE DC in the mid to late 50s when my grandfather was stationed at Andrews AFB.  She remembers the first day her junior high was integrated: there were maybe two blacks.  They moved in 1959 but my grandfather died of a heart attack in &#8216;72 and was buried in Arlington.  After his funeral they drove through the old neighborhood and by her old school.  Every child on the playground was black.  An amazing transformation in little over a decade.  And the first blacks to move into the neighborhood did it by getting whites to sign the papers for them.</p>

<p>I bet representative &#8220;Homes&#8221; would not even go into any of &#8220;those&#8221; neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Unless you are familiar with the place, be very careful. Like in Chicago, those folks taking the Dan Ryan expressway north into the downtown area. A local would know that if your car breaks down while you are driving on the expressway, DO NOT GET OUT OF YOUR CAR AND TRY TO WALK INTO THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD TO GET HELP! The only &#8220;help&#8221; you will get is an instantaneous beating or worse.</p>

		<p>I saw Beck today on Fox euligizing MLK, kissing up, etc.  He emphasized that he will not be speaking from as high a step at the Lincoln Memorial as MLK did,&hellip; blah, blah, blah,&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tuned in on Glen Beck several times in the past two weeks.  Everytime he presents often good information, but comes to a conclusion that not just hurts racial realism, but actually serves to purvey misinformation.  Glen Beck is a throw away.  And until the Tea Party(s) have the guts - or at least the political opportunity to state the reality of racial realism and the real harm it denial is doing to not just whites, but the entire coutnry, the Tea Party is pretty useless itself.  <br>

		<p>In younger days, I was stationed in DC with the military. Being young and stupid, I figured I could go anywhere in our nation&rsquo;s capital and deal with anyone I encountered in a rational way. It WAS the capital of the United States of America afterall, right?</p>
<p>Taking a bike ride east of the Capitol Building, I cruised along unconcerned through a black neighborhood. People looked at me as if I were nuts; blacks afterall are perfectly aware of the behavioral tendencies of the &#8220;black community&#8221; even if a young white kid of the seventies like myself wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>At some point, a barechested young fellow with a beard came running at my bike, snarling like an animal. I caught him in the solar plexus and rode away from the area as fast as I could. I don&rsquo;t know whether he was just trying to scare me or whether he actually intended to pull me off my bike, and I didn&rsquo;t bother asking him.</p>
<p>It still took most of the rest of my tour in DC to get it through my thick skull that our nation&rsquo;s capital is a very dangerous place, especially for white people who wander into the wrong parts of it.

		<p>I was born in DC, grew up in neighboring PG County, and settled for a few years in (at that time predominantly white) Montgomery County. About 8 years ago my wife was expecting our first child. There was NO WAY that my kids were going to grow up in an overpriced, crime-infested, majority black town like I did! I moved my family to Seattle and never looked back!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s laughable that showing concern for another person&rsquo;s safety is now racism. Growing up, you avoided DC east of 16th street, and you also avoided at least 80% of PG County unless you had a death wish. The sad part is that you had the largest concentration of affluent blacks in the area, and it was still a ghetto! Let&rsquo;s not forget that all of those left-wing lobbyist and politicians DON&rsquo;T LIVE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS! They usually live uptown or in the affluent (read white) suburbs of DC. Sometimes we had the do-gooder whites teachers from New England come to our schools, thinking they were going to help the blacks, and by the end of the year they had enough racial epithets to make any of us blush. </p>
<p>That city is a joke. The only good things I got out of a childhood spent as the token white is the fact that it&rsquo;s easy to communicate with blacks, and that I learned something that these do-gooder whites will never understand: you can only reason with a non-white so much, and a few exemplary non-whites does not excuse a race of criminals. </p>

I didn&rsquo;t care what the offWhite doorman thought, I broke into the conversation and told those people in no uncertain terms, they had no business going up there.

<p>Beck is nothing more than a White executioner. He has no Pride. As soon as the blacks started hollering, like they always do, that he was a (RACIST!!!) the first thing he done was pandering. Totally embarrassing. Totally cowardice. Hes a joke to me.</p>

		<p>Norton and her political cronies are attacking the Tea Party movement for one reason:  it&rsquo;s threatening the power of Obama and the whole pro-black agenda.  The fact is that almost all American whites know D.C. is, in many ways, as dangerous as a hot war zone.  Three-fourths of its males will be adversely involved in the criminal-justice system at least once in their lives.  There are plenty of places in the District where Holmes herself wouldn&rsquo;t go without armed escort.  Americans KNOW that low-class blacks are the most dangerous group of people in the nation, and, furthermore, folks of every ethnicity  &mdash;  including other blacks  &mdash;  acknowledge it.  People identified with the Tea Party want to be seen as a legitimate grassroots movement and not as some fringe group on par with neo-Nazis.  Liberals are already foaming at the mouth in their zeal to discredit the movement, and establishment conservatives are just beginning to realize that they must either accomodate it or face a Republican-splitting third party.  </p>

Even our local &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show hosts will NEVER ever tell the truths about race and if a caller happens to mention anything negative or crime stats of NONwhites then they are all of a sudden cut-off. Then the host has to mention the (White) racism that is still prevelant in our country! Oh, and the inevitable, &#8220;I have black friends&#8221; or &#8220;all races have criminals&#8221;!!</p>

		<p>Anonymous#7, I agree!  Since DC is a &#8220;multi-ethnic city where everybody gets along&#8221;, I think someone should do a blog for &#8216;Non-Racist Tea Partiers&rsquo;, with a &#8216;Rainbow Experience Map&rsquo;, listing all the high-points, where Diversity is exceptionally thick and tasty.  Maybe there can be a Diversity Parcours that people can walk or take public transit to navigate.  Half an hour, lolling about at each extra-diverse point should be enough, both to allow the Non-Racist Tea Partier to soak up the salubrious atmosphere generated by the multi-ethnics &#8220;getting along&#8221;, and for the multi-ethnics present at each stop to fully &#8220;interact with&#8221; the Non-Racist Tea Partier.</p>
<p>Any survivors can trot up to the head of the class, and get  Gold Stars on their report cards.  For they truly will have proven themselves to be good little ideologues.</p>
<p>Alternately, &#8216;evil Racists&rsquo; can use the Rainbow Experience Map in a reverse and perverse way, as a guide for discovering new places to avoid.</p>

Things are slowly getting better, but it is still best to avoid black neighborhoods, especially after dark.  Capital Hill is fairly safe.  So is North West Washington west of 16th Street.  Even there, I carry pepper spray.  <br>

When liberals present facts like this, they expect whites to be ashamed.  Nevertheless, the rise in the prison population is a major reason for the decline in the national crime rate since 1980.  In 1980 the national crime rate was 5,950.0 per 100,000 inhabitants.  By 2008 that had declined to 3,667.0 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to FBI, Uniform Crime Reports.<br>

According to Justice Policy Institute of U.S. Department of Justice Data, in 1980 there were 315,974 convicts in American prisons.  By 2000 that had grown to 1,428,187.<br>

<p>Recently, I myself had the misfortune of switching to his show on television late one night, where I observed how he felt the need to spend an hour if not more, going into how the Native Americans were NOT s  &mdash;  -ges, and that they were actually either related to the Chinese or the Egyptians and Hebrews, and they had very advanced cities.  </p>
