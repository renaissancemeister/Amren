			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elisa Crouch, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stacey Wright had more than a dozen choices when it came to enrolling three of her children in an elementary school, from charters to magnets to traditional public schools in every corner of the city.</p>
<p>She chose Jefferson Elementary School, the brick St. Louis public school across the street. And for that, she may get $900.</p>
<p>For the first time, a local organization is offering parents a cash incentive to enroll their children at Jefferson. The money is limited to students who didn&rsquo;t attend the school last year. To get it, the kids must finish this semester with near-perfect attendance and receive no out-of-school suspensions; the parent must attend three PTO meetings. The program is being offered to families in three mixed-income housing complexes surrounding the school, where most of the students live.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paying families for their children&rsquo;s behavior and attendance is part of an ongoing debate in a half dozen cities. Kids themselves also have been paid for everything from grades on tests to the number of books they read. A Harvard University study in July showed that such incentives improve classroom behavior  &mdash;  but they don&rsquo;t necessarily raise test scores. {snip}</p>
<p>Proponents say the cash rewards are no different from offering college scholarships to top achievers at a high school, and that low-income families need the extra help. Critics counter that the cash prizes fail to address problems that lead to truancy and poor test scores, such as bad teaching or a dull curriculum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Jefferson Elementary, the $300 incentive per child is offered by Urban Strategies, a nonprofit organization based in St. Louis. For years, it has partnered with McCormack Baron Ragan Management, the development company that manages Murphy Park, The Brewery and O&rsquo;Fallon, the three housing complexes surrounding the school.</p>
<p>In 1998, Urban Strategies raised money for renovations at Jefferson. This year, it&rsquo;s paying to train teachers in how to conduct at-home visits. The organization is offering $250 to the four teachers at Jefferson who make the most of them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this month, parents got letters informing them that the school fell short of annual progress goals in the Missouri Assessment Program. Less than 15 percent of students passed the reading and math sections on last year&rsquo;s statewide test. The letter offered parents the option of transferring to other schools in the district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rewards in schools are nothing new. Suburban districts for years have offered pizza coupons, tickets to amusement parks and baseball games for those who make the honor roll or read a certain number of books over the summer.</p>
<p>In St. Louis Public Schools, the district has rewarded kids who attend the first day of school by entering them in drawings for tickets to sporting events. Until recently, Maritz Inc., the motivational and corporate travel company in Fenton, gave students at school the first week chances to win a big screen television, stereo equipment, T-shirts and rulers.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The money is limited to those who didn`t attend the school last year&#8221;. Yeah, that dog won`t hunt. Not for long. And frankly they should have seen that coming. It`s like the phone companies who &#8220;give&#8221; 400 dollars to new customers, while  offering the long termers nothing. <br/>

		<p>Most teachers who teach in the St. Louis City Public Schools are graduates of Harris-Stowe State &#8220;University&#8221; in St. Louis.  While &#8220;Harris-Slow,&#8221; as we call it, is not officially an HBCU, it is that functionally.  It has the lowest admissions standards of any institution of higher learning in the state that claims to have admissions standards, and its coursework is only slightly easier than that of an average high school.</p>
<p>Because my high school did not have math classes beyond what would be the rough equivalent of first semester college calculus, and I did that course during my junior year, this meant that I had to take second-semester calculus in a college setting.  (I didn&rsquo;t want to stay away from math for a whole year, as I was planning on majoring in it in college.)  At first, I enrolled in H-S&rsquo;s Calc II.  Amazingly, Calc II was the highest level math class it offered, and for an institution which produces most SLPS teachers, I thought that was odd.  But two days before the course was supposed to start, I get a call stating that the class was canceled.  Next day I went for my tuition refund, and the registrar said that I was the only person who signed up for the course   &mdash;   None of H-S&rsquo;s &#8220;regular&#8221; students did.  I wound up being able to register for Calc II and take it at St. Louis City&rsquo;s junior college.  There were enough registrants to justify it having Calc II, but again, they offered nothing higher than Calc II.  </p>
<p>I can ill imagine that giving money to the low IQ parents to make sure their low IQ children have near perfect attendance at a school with almost as low IQ teachers, and have the parents attend a few PTO meetings a year with said teachers, will make a bit of difference.</p>
<p>The only positive I can take from this article is that it&rsquo;s not our tax money being used for this program.  I&rsquo;ll say that today, then it&rsquo;ll be just our luck I find out tomorrow that Urban Strategies is swimming in Federal or state taxpayer grants.  Then I&rsquo;ll look like a fool.</p>

It never worked and it never will work.</p>
<p>Achievement comes from an internal drive to want to improve your life. You can&rsquo;t bribe people to improve themselves; they have to want it.</p>
<p>Social science experiments have proven this. Motivation HAS to come from within.</p>
<p>The question is why do we have to bride kids today when in the past we didn&rsquo;t? What changed?<br/>

		<p>White kids get SMALL rewards for outstanding achievement. Mostly just recognition is enough. White kids never get dollars for going to school. </p>
<p>What they are proposing here&hellip; is to give financial awards just for showing up. Not for achievement. Not for trying. Just for breathing. What nonsense.</p>

		<p>This has been tried a hundred times and has failed 100% of the time.  If a sub-group of America thinks getting an education is &#8216;acting white&rsquo;, then they are a lost cause.  Ban welfare for 3 generations and make them learn the hard way. It will be successful and cost the tax payer less.</p>

		<p>#4 is correct.  Most ghetto dwellers are absolutely incapable of doing anything that requires even semi-sustained effort.  I&rsquo;ve read where some wouldn&rsquo;t even take their child to the dentist for a payoff.  But the liberals will continue with their foolhardy efforts.  That way, they don&rsquo;t have to face the truth.</p>

<p>Would that White kids receive recognition by their own schools and communities for outstanding academic achievement.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for non-Whites, there is every kind of medal, accolade, school- and district-wide honor, scholarship, grant and recognition imaginable for the most banal &#8216;achievements.&rsquo;  Showing up for school for a month (whether on time or not) merits special acknowledgement. Dressing for PE for a week earns special honors.  The kid &#8216;reads&rsquo; two books and gets a $50 gift certificate.  Graduating with barely a B-average in a dumbed down educational system garners offers of full rides from prestigious universities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attended these special assemblies replete with medals, trophies, certificates, scholarships, cash gifts, reporters and photographers from the local paper, and &#8216;dignitaries&rsquo; giving speeches (That often go thus:  &#8216;Despite extreme hardship, despite great odds, Sheddrick has managed to overcome adversity in a racist, oppressive system that tried to crush him and succeeded at&hellip;.)  You&rsquo;d think you were at the ceremony for Nobel Prizes the way school officials carry on.</p>

		<p>This is worse than Africa or any black majority nation.  At least those kids fight to go to school.  And if they cannot afford to go, they work!  This country&rsquo;s cult like thinking in how to deal with black/hispanic issues are beyond reality.  Folks, this country act like it is rich but actually is living on credit cards.  The credit card limit is fast approaching.  We, the average taxpayer is getting very tired and worn out from being forced to support a cult (mindless) like reality.</p>

		<p>This won&rsquo;t work. If they pay the parents the first day of school, they have the green, they will then slack off. If it is to be paid at the end of the school year  &mdash;  that is nine months away, too far for most of these types to sustain effort. The ones who can and will are the ones who would have stayed in school all year anyway. </p>

		<p>Wow!  So now we have to pay parents to get their kids to go to school.  This will backfire because another &#8216;entitlement&rsquo; mentality will set in and in the future ALL children in the majority black/latino future amerika will DEMAND payments to go to school.</p>
<p>As the whites dwindle away and retreat to isolated corners here and there, the gov&rsquo;t will print money like water and one day our currency will be next to worthless, propped up only by chinese raw materials companies who will eventually own all our mines, remaining forests and other valuable assets.</p>

<p>I am forced to attend these also.  My first year in public school teaching we had a graduating class that was so unprepared for the real world, so coddled and overconfident, so lacking in personal discipline and even manners that I was in shock.</p>
<p>Every other word they would utter was a curse or the &#8220;N&#8221; word.  95% never did hw for any teacher.  We all would complain every day about what Marisol or Dequan was doing.</p>
<p>We all knew the score from the principle though (a left wing social justice advocate): pass them or get harrassed out of a job.  So come graduation day, everyone was beaming with happiness as the &#8216;graduates&rsquo; were serenaded in song, poems and acolades.  Our young lefty female teachers were in tears of joy.  And on it goes.  20 more years&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Giving money to non students to behave in ways that actual students do for free contributes to the utter confusion of non-students and their families.  If the students don&rsquo;t fulfill their commitments and the money is taken away, the students will go after the teacher, administrator or other person they blame for loss of their funds.  A community college teacher told me of a colleague who was confronted and threatened by a student for the grade they received when that grade jeopardized the student&rsquo;s grant/scholarship money.  If one has no regard for the intangible, abstract value of education, that regard cannot be bought. </p>
