			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Budoff Brown, Politico, August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama has lost the most trusted man in the Hispanic media.</p>
<p>Univision&rsquo;s Jorge Ramos, an anchor on the nation&rsquo;s largest Spanish-language television network, says Obama broke his promise to produce an immigration reform bill within a year of taking office. And Latinos are tired of the speeches, disillusioned by the lack of White House leadership and distrustful of the president, Ramos told POLITICO.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a credibility problem right now with Latinos,&#8221; Ramos said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ll see what the political circumstances are in a couple of years, but there is a serious credibility problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramos has been called the Walter Cronkite of Spanish-language media, an unparalleled nationwide voice for Hispanics. {snip} Ramos may be on the leading edge of a movement within the Hispanic media to challenge the president on immigration  &mdash;  a shift that some observers believe is contributing to Obama&rsquo;s eroding poll numbers among Latino voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The editorials and commentary from the Spanish-language media have been brutal since April, when Arizona passed its controversial immigration enforcement law  &mdash;  a moment that crystallized a sense of urgency among Latinos but also underscored how little progress the White House had made on reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Words matter,&#8221; Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz-Balart said in April on NBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221;  &mdash;  adding that Obama&rsquo;s campaign promise, known as &#8220;La Promesa de Obama,&#8221; has gone unfulfilled. &#8220;We haven&rsquo;t seen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Obama announced his decision to send 1,200 guards to the U.S.-Mexico border in May, an editorial in El Diario La Prensa of New York asked: &#8220;Who&rsquo;s in charge in Washington?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unprecedented what Spanish-language media has been doing over the past several months,&#8221; Cancela said in an interview. &#8220;Many in the administration thought there was a cozy relationship and the Spanish-language media would play the role of quiet cooperator. It has been a wake-up call.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Latinos voted overwhelmingly for President Obama, and they expected him to keep his promise and he broke his promise,&#8221; said Ramos, author of the recently released book &#8220;A Country for All: An Immigrant Manifesto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was able to get 60 votes for financial reform, if he can get 60 votes to extend unemployment benefits, how come he can&rsquo;t get 60 votes for immigration reform?&#8221; Ramos asked. &#8220;So many Latinos feel there is a lack of leadership, and he is not fighting for immigration reform with the same intensity that he fought for health care reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The swing in opinion couldn&rsquo;t come at a worse time for Democrats, who need a strong Latino turnout in November if they hope to maintain control of Congress. That voting bloc could be decisive in dozens of competitive House, Senate and gubernatorial races across the West, according to a report by America&rsquo;s Voice, an immigration reform advocacy group.</p>
<p>But polls show signs of trouble. Obama&rsquo;s approval rating among Hispanics dropped from 69 percent in January to 57 percent in May, even as his support among black and white voters remained stable, according to the Gallup Poll.</p>
<p>In a Univision/Associated Press poll released last month, only 43 percent of 1,521 Hispanics surveyed from March 11 to June 3 said Obama is adequately addressing their needs.</p>
<p>Ramos places blame on Republicans as well  &mdash;  as do the editorial pages of the country&rsquo;s largest Hispanic daily newspapers  &mdash;  for doing nothing to resolve the immigration issue. But these papers say they never expected much from the GOP. Democrats, in their view, are a different story.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Editorial page editors and Spanish-language journalists told POLITICO that their coverage reflects rising frustration in their community. For years, they said, Democratic leaders told Hispanics to be patient; now, their patience has run out.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Obama administration is set to deport more illegal immigrants this year than during the last year of the Bush administration, expelling otherwise law-abiding workers and tearing families apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a disappointment of a promise that has not been fulfilled,&#8221; said Henrik Rehbinder, La Opinion&rsquo;s editorial page editor. &#8220;More than disappointment is some anger, some resentment, over the fact that this administration was going to be sensitive to family separations, and they really are not.&#8221; The critique from Ramos could prove particularly damaging to the White House.</p>
<p>A Mexican immigrant and Univision anchor for more than 20 years, Ramos carries such weight with Hispanic-Americans that his commentary is viewed as the definitive take on an issue  &mdash;  &#8220;kind of the final word on it,&#8221; said America&rsquo;s Voice Executive Director Frank Sharry.</p>

		<p>The immigration problem has been ignored far too long. And now Obama is being forced to do a little something about it-very little. Let us hope that if and when this is properly addressed, the illegals will not like it at all. </p>

		<p>Jorge Ramos is a joke. He is personally responsible for spreading the falsehood that the U.S is a country of immigrants, therefore anyone who walks across the border is entitled to a Green Card, a house and a job. Univision&rsquo;s message to the illegals in the U.S is that they have the right to be here and demand legalization because they too pay taxes through their jobs (acquired by using false documents) and when they buy a soda pop at the store. He has written some books on his personal life story, and on immigration related issues thus multiplying his fortune by giving false hope to illegals while selling them his rags. I&rsquo;ve seen him debating Lou Dobbs in the past and he can&rsquo;t even speak decent English after more than 20 years in this country, not to mention Lou Dobbs shut his mouth in no time..</p>

		<p>Just in: &#8220;The white press announced today &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Seriously, it is ironic that when reporting on the &#8220;Spanish-language media&#8221; and the &#8220;Spanish-language journalists&#8221; one never seems to hear about those representing Spain. Not pro-illegal enough? Speak Spanish with a strange accent? Wore out their welcome with the Aztecs? Or maybe just too darn European? (I know how they must feel.)<br>

Border Enforcement + Immigration Moratorium = Job, Crime and Eco Sanity.  </p>

		<p>The illegals are trying to bring this to a head and I think that&rsquo;s GREAT! It won&rsquo;t help the democrats and the backlash will force the gop to &#8220;get tough&#8221;. With a bad economy there is just no need for 20 million extra workers doing menial labor. And there is no way the government will amnesty them and let all those people on welfare. They&rsquo;re already costing us an arm and a leg as it is. So if the illegals try to bring this to a head at a time when the US doesn&rsquo;t need the cheap later then they ~might~ end up getting booted.</p>

		<p>The only &#8220;path&#8221; for illegals should be the one back to where they came from. Jorge and others like him put it all right on the table. The MOST important thing to these people is amnesty and unrestricted access to our country, Not healthcare, not the economy, and certainly not respect for the law. When Jorge Ramos talks about reform he means open borders, or maybe he really didn&rsquo;t mean to title his book A country for All ( illegals ). When anyone speaks of &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; ask these simple questions. <br>
Who grants you permission to enter? The United States.<br>
Where did you get the idea that anyone has the right to come here? The United States grants that right.<br>
If part of the reform is to secure the border, wouldn&rsquo;t you do that first? <br>
If there is a way to secure the border once &#8220;reform&#8221; is in place, why hasn&rsquo;t it been done already?<br>
Once the &#8220;pathway to citizenship&#8221; is granted, what will stop more illegals from coming?<br>
Why can&rsquo;t we arrest and deport illegals? You can, MILLIONS of criminals are arrested and incarcerated every year.<br>
The last question is the most important one. The amnesty crowd says that it is impossible to stop illegal immigration. How many people sneak across the border from North Korea into South Korea? NONE. The border is secured. Bring the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as alot of other places and close the border. Then send some of them to the next amnesty protest. Have them look for mestizos waving mexican flags. You ask how can we find and deport all the illeagals? That would be a great place to start.</p>

		<p>Typical political spoiling and entrapment tactics.</p>
<p>Deny your Democratic opponents the policy leg up that will give him political dominance for the next umpteen years until &#8216;Spanish Media&rsquo; and &#8216;Spanish Government&rsquo; no longer need them and the reality of multicult society sets in.</p>
<p>Use that /apparent/ paladinism to be cheered back into Congressional voting balance against a hostile black White House that has socialization advantagement for 12% of the population on it&rsquo;s mind rather than &#8216;best for most&rsquo; of the rest of us.  Effectively killing the possibility of doing -anything- in this administration that might be useful in transforming the nation towards (for instance) a green electric society.</p>
<p>Rah-rah-A-meri-ca.  More Of The Same.</p>
<p>What a lot of white Americans need to be mindful of is that if there is no -actual- movement, en-masse, against these people, they will still represent an untapped resource for -someone- to pick up on.  And no advantage lasts forever.</p>
<p>The GOP, deluded as ever on the value of the Hispanic vote and it&rsquo;s &#8216;potential loyalty shift&rsquo;, will see that windfall as a trophy right.  Even as they steer clear of anything that seems Hitlerian in it&rsquo;s forced exodus potential for backdraft.</p>
<p>Because, to them, no issue has any moral meaning beyond the leverage it brings in the time that that leverage can net them more power.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect the Republicans to follow through on &#8216;the will of the people&rsquo; folks.  They, like the Democrats (or at least their fellow traveller money men), are a society unto themselves with a motto that comes down to: &#8220;Is it good for the Republicans?&#8221;</p>

<p>Far from &#8220;forcing it to get tough,&#8221; I&rsquo;m afraid the backlash will give the useless GOP a free pass, and they&rsquo;ll dredge up some nullity who makes John McCain look like Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>I wonder how much it cost to try to prevent two white people from crossing the border?</p>

		<p>I wanted to share this video from Anderson Cooper 360.Notice how the white mother is accused of not being diverse enough and her little boy gets labeled with &#8220;racial bias&#8221;. As usual, the black families are made to feel like victims. Typical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also noticing a trend where half blacks are the only ones that get a place on t.v. I hardly ever see dark blacks in commericals and other media.  </p>

		<p>This situation is so amazing.  I work around a lot of latinos, and they are totally ANGRY with Obama.  To hear them bad mouth him is incredible.  (They use a lot of curse words in their normal discourse, and they have very choice ones for Obama).</p>
<p>Funny thing is, when he was a candidate, the Latinos I know were hailing Obama as a savior who would give citizenship (and a free job, house, etc) to all latinos.  Now they curse him because he can&rsquo;t fulfill their wishes.  The good thing is that it&rsquo;s because a lot of Democrats are not going along with his agenda.</p>
