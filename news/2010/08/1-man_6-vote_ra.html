<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=188173">1-Man, 6-Vote Racial Plan Used to Choose Board&rsquo;s 1st Minority</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Unruh, WorldNetDaily, August 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A bloc of Hispanics, estimated at a little over 20 percent of the voters, successfully installed a candidate of its choosing on a city council after a federal judge ordered the traditional one-person-one-vote system altered because the majority continued to prevail in election after election.</p>
<p>The situation developed in Port Chester, N.Y., where a majority white population continued to choose white candidates for the council, outvoting the estimated 21.9 percent of the voting population that was Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson, noting there were many more Hispanics who were not voters, demanded a change and approved the city&rsquo;s plan that gave each voter six votes  &mdash;  with permission to concentrate them in any fashion in the recent council election.</p>
<p>The result was that instead of having voters cast one vote in each of six council races this summer, they were allowed to cast up to six votes for a single candidate.</p>
<p>Activists who oppose illegal immigration condemned the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;It encourages racial voting,&#8221; said William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. &#8220;It works only when a minority votes in a racist fashion .&nbsp;.&nbspp;. instead of choosing candidates on their qualifications.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan approved by the judge in a lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department over the town&rsquo;s election procedures was aimed at reducing the one-person-one-vote system&rsquo;s effect of &#8220;illegally&#8221; diminishing Hispanic influence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit claimed the village&rsquo;s at-large system in which all voters voted in the race for each open seat on the board let majority white voters prevent minority Hispanic voters from electing their candidates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine [a federal program that turns] 12 million illegal aliens into voters,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Envision a future of when that happens. A lot of people aren&rsquo;t really thinking about [when the U.S. would] suddenly have a new voting bloc of 12 million illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Council elections previously were staggered, with two candidates selected each election and an at-large winner-take-the-seat voting procedure. The procedure imposed under the federal government&rsquo;s lawsuit had all six council seats filled during the same election  &mdash;  with each voter given six votes to use any way he or she chooses.</p>
<p>The result, as reported by The New York Times, was the election of Luis Marino, a Latino candidate who ran as a Democrat. Also elected was the first black on the board, Republican Joseph D. Kenner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Council elections previously were staggered, with two candidates selected each election and an at-large winner-take-the-seat voting procedure. The procedure imposed under the federal government&rsquo;s lawsuit had all six council seats filled during the same election &mdash; with each voter given six votes to use any way he or she chooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, what was done by USSA District Judge, Comrade Stephen Robinson, yet again demonstrates just how foolish Reds like him are. They have no concept of moderation and for a sociopolitical group that traditionally prides themselves on, &ldquo;long term planning,&rdquo; they really do miss the Pandora&rsquo;s Box they have opened in so many instances, and not just with this case. Often, I reflect on how easy it would be through existing entities like the EEOC or HUD, to reverse everything that revolves around &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; and &ldquo;integration,&rdquo; and impose the exact opposite; the power is there, just not the political will, yet! </p>
<p>They always take things way too far, thus setting a precedent of future political surrealism. Look Comrade Judge Robinson may have thought this move &ldquo;clever,&rdquo; but it is hardly so; it would have been enough to simply order that all council elections be held with all candidates on the ballot for a single election, with voters allowed only one vote per candidate. By not doing this, he risks future legal challenges at best. At worst, he invites electoral irregularities and malfeasances that he never dreamed of. </p>
<p>Say things like possible pro-white legal rectifications (for lack of a better word) of diversity&rsquo;s &ldquo;enrichments,&rdquo; in all US elections in the near future?</p>
<p>Enough said, other than, may God let it be so!</p>

		<p>Two points:</p>
<p>First, if our Judicial Branch knows what the most desirable outcome of elections are, then why permit them at all? The Judge should simply appoint &#8220;representatives&#8221; and be done with it. I would rather put an end to the charade of elections if the Judicial Branch is going to keep gaming the system to thwart the popular will. At least it&rsquo;s more honest.</p>
<p>Second, until there are enough Hispanics to make this a majority-minority country, Hispanics simply need to accept that they are a minority. It&rsquo;s not the end of the world - there are plenty of small interest groups with a great deal of influence who get much of what they want and need.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if that is unacceptable to them, I know a perfect solution to the problem. There are many, many countries that have big Hispanic majorities.</p>
<p>They should go there.</p>

<p>However, U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson, noting there were many more Hispanics who were not voters.</p>
<p>Hmmmm - - I wonder why they were&rsquo;nt voters? Ya think that maybe they are illegals and should&rsquo;nt be here to begin with? This &#8220;judge&#8221; basically gave illegals the right to vote.</p>
<p>-aimed at reducing the one-person-one-vote system&rsquo;s effect of &ldquo;illegally&rdquo; diminishing Hispanic influence.</p>
<p>Should&rsquo;nt that read &#8220;diminishing illegal Hispanic influence&#8221;? </p>

		<p>What a great idea! I propose this be extended to white aborted fetuses as well, so we can overpower the 6 votes each illegal is allowed to have.  You know, why should we stop there? Let&rsquo;s also get some more votes considering that the white soldiers who died should be worth a vote as well, and the white people killed well that should be worth at least one vote, perhaps two for their pain and suffering and, well being dead and all.  I would like to meet the judge that thought this was a good idea so I can shake his hand and thank him for such a wonderful idea.</p>

		<p>Interesting thing about this is, like a heck of alot of things in the past year&hellip;&hellip;.whites are having the fact that other races are racist IN THE EXTREME, being rammed down our throats.</p>
<p>The only way this happened is because whites will split their vote to reflect the person that will do what they want&hellip;&hellip;while hispanics only care about one thing&hellip;.race.</p>

<p>Democracy is, in fact, the problem.  Nothing more than a euphemism for communism, it is rapidly being shown to be the joke that it is.  One man, one vote&hellip;.ONE TIME.</p>
<p>There has never been a multi-racial society built around &#8220;democracy&#8221;.  It doesn&rsquo;t work.  Each race simply rebuilds a race based dictatorship or oligarchy of one form or another.</p>
<p>Whites need to do this&hellip;..and soon.  One way or another, we will be forced to do it because that is the way it is done, no exceptions&hellip;.even America (especially America).  Without our oligarchy, whites are being displaced.</p>

		<p>This could backfire on them. Suppose a Latino candidate needs 100 votes to win, but gets 600 because 100 Latino voters cast all six of their votes for him. Obviously, he got 500 more votes than he needed; these votes were wasted which otherwise could have been used to help other liberal non-Latino candidates. This is how Newt Gingrich got elected. Democrats gerrymandered essentially a 100% black district in Georgia so blacks could have one of their own in Washington. This sucked Democrat votes away from Newt&rsquo;s opponent, helping Newt get elected.</p>
<p>And here is an explanation of why it will backfire on them .</p>

		<p>   So the Judge has concluded that the &#8220;white folk&#8221; are voting for candidates solely because they&rsquo;re white instead of voting for them because they&rsquo;re the best qualified?&hellip; and therefore we must install minorities whether or not they are the best qualified?  What kind of idiot judge came up with that illogical non-democratic un-constitutional&hellip;..oh? The judge is black? </p>

		<p>Back when this was set down by the judge, it was reported that this same thing has happened in other parts of the country. Always a blind, liberal judge legislating from the bench. I believe it was Patrick Henry that warned the greatest threat to the new nation was the judicial branch.I hope and pray our country wakes up before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
