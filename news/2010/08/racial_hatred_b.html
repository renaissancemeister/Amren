<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What led to the 2006 death of Cheryl Green was not a calculated crime but an indiscriminate racial hatred that has long plagued a narrow strip of Los Angeles squeezed between Torrance and Carson, known as the Harbor Gateway area, a prosecutor said Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was a world in which intimidating and killing blacks was a &#8220;full-time enterprise&#8221; for powerful Latino gangs, and walls covered in graffiti with racial epithets made it abundantly clear that blacks were not welcome in the area, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gretchen Ford told jurors.</p>
<p>Jonathan Fajardo, now 22, faces the death penalty if convicted of [Cheryl] Green&rsquo;s murder. Fajardo and a second defendant, Daniel Aguilar, 23, are also accused in the stabbing death of a potential witness, a fellow gang member whom they suspected of talking to the police shortly after the shooting. Aguilar is not charged in Green&rsquo;s killing.</p>
<p>Ford said the chain of events began with a black man driving up in an SUV to a market in the area that members of the 204th Street gang frequented. When Fajardo and others approached the car, the man flashed a gun, and the gang members, who were unarmed, fled.</p>
<p>Fajardo, angry over the confrontation, retrieved a gun from a friend&rsquo;s apartment and later opened fire on Green and her friends because they were black, Ford alleged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police, suspecting that the 204th Street gang was involved because the shooting had targeted blacks, served search warrants on known gang hangouts, one of which was the apartment of Christopher Ash. When Ash was arrested but released later the same day, the gang began &#8220;gossiping&#8221; that he might have been cooperating with the police, Ford said.</p>
<p>Gang members lured Ash to a garage, where they took turns stabbing him, Ford told the jury.</p>
<p>Ash&rsquo;s body, stabbed 80 times and with his throat slit, was found on the side of a road in Carson two weeks after Green&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Ford said Fajardo, in a lengthy statement to police, admitted to Green&rsquo;s killing and to suspecting Ash of being a snitch. He believed that Ash, the only non-Latino member of the gang, kept a diary about the gang&rsquo;s dealings, Ford said.</p>

		<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>This article contains nothing of merit or any real evidence of hispanic on black ethnic cleansing.  But it does show something not so obvious about our racial enemies&hellip;..they are incredibly unstable and incohesive&hellip;..and paranoid.  Paranoia is fear.  Their fear was so great that they killed on of their own.  Their lack of cohesiveness so obvious that they had no problem doing it.</p>
<p>My point is a &#8220;gang&#8221; is not a group.  They do not organize and use violence as a means to an end.  It&rsquo;s a manifestation of pathology with ties that don&rsquo;t go beyond the very most surface level.</p>
<p>Which raises some interesting possibilities should any &#8220;organized&#8221; conflict develop between the US and mexico.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;corridor&#8221; the prosecutor mentions is not an isolated part of town where the inhabitants are anti-black.  Although jumping out of vehicles and randomly shooting into crowds is unusual,  black/Hispanic killings, attacks and assaults are very common between the two groups.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t we often read of schools, jails and prisons placed on lockdown in mostly black/Hispanic jails, and the same is done in mostly black/Hispanic neighborhoods quite frequently, with the violence spreading out into the street and the surrounding neighborhood?  </p>
<p>I know on at least one occassion, black Muslim adults were patrolling around an area school, looking for Hispanics to even the score on a matter where Hispanics totally devestated a mob of blacks that jumped a couple of Hispanics, because they were alone.  Then, other Hispanics joined in and beat the black attackers badly.</p>
<p>THe black mammys were screeching, because they said the school wasn&rsquo;t protecting their little darlings.</p>
<p>Sheriff Baca admits there is an ongoing intense racial war in the LA area, but the whites there all deny it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same spineless types in the white power structure who childishly believe that covering up the problem will give them more time to correct it; however, they are never able to correct violent racial animus no matter what they do, but it doesn&rsquo;t keep them from continuing to lie about the situation.</p>
<p>A lot of people are voicing concern about whites having to defend against both blacks and Hispanics in any societal upheaval that breaks out due to the deteriorating economic conditions; however, it will be the black/brown war that will be on the boob tube first for all to see.  </p>
<p>While there will be street demonstrations and tax rioting by whites, they won&rsquo;t enter the racial conflagration until long after the black/brown fighting is well under way.  It will spread from coast to coast also.</p>

<p>Speaking to whites who live in or around LA, I don&rsquo;t get the impression that they are in any sort of denial about this. They simply don&rsquo;t care, because it doesn&rsquo;t affect them.</p>

		<p>Poster #2 is right.  The downfall of this country will begin with interracial warfare of Mexicans versus blacks.  Whites, even liberal whites, are generally smart enough not to live in areas dominated by either group.  </p>
<p>Eventually, it will engulf us until we get a backbone and form our territories and defend them.  Asians will be a large group of splinter gangs at war with everyone and each other. </p>

<p>Your comment, and the article itself lends credibility (as if any were needed) to my comments in the past that neither blacks nor hispanics can organize, develop AND execute a plan with any long term goals. The instant gratification is all they can focus on. Africans are especially prone to this, as are Arabs. Those peoples lack cohesiveness and a willingness to take orders from anyone NOT of their tribe. So as Lawrence of Arabia said, they will always be a small people. I said before and now again, NO ONE is better at genocide than whites when we are pissed enough to begin its&rsquo; execution. Whites are able, ready and willing to make a plan, subordinate units, follow orders and execute said plan and move on to the next phase of said plan as opposed to the blacks/hispanics inclination to stop, loot, rape, burn and pillage.</p>

		<p>Christopher Ash was an Anglo, the only non-hispanic member of the &#8220;gang&#8221; and probably not fully a gang member either, given his race since gangs are race oriented 1st of course. I suspect his race played a major part in being suspected of a &#8220;rata&#8221;. </p>

		<p>As with any vicious killing by anyone, outside of war or immediate self-defense, a premeditated murder should be severely punished, usually by the death penalty administered promptly. That of course is not the case in the Due Process of USA. So let&rsquo;s as the social scientists say, get at the &#8220;root&#8221; of the problem.</p>
<p>So  let the liberal sociologists, many of whom work in the California state university system, figure out what drove these frustrated &#8220;young people&#8221; to such a dastardly act. Let them get on TV and make the same excuses for these homicidal Latinos often made of youths in the black &#8220;community&#8221;. BTW, how is it that blacks live in THE community, but no one else in the world does?</p>
<p>I suggest the US govt offer to intervene and send the perps to Afghanistan to slit a few Taliban throats. I wouldn&rsquo;t make this offer to black gang members who would last about an hour in Central Asia. Two years of honorable service ( overlook pot, opium and hashish smoking in that drug infested rathole)and wipe their records clean. </p>
<p>Oh yes. Deport the suffering Latino &#8220;youth&#8221; then back to whatever Central American problem nation they or their parents came from. They won&rsquo;t complain. Better than jail or the death penalty. And they&rsquo;ll be back soon thanks to the pro &#8220;immigrant&#8221; Dept of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Or let Al Sharpton &#8220;demand&#8221; a federal civil rights investigation to find justice for the dead blacks. He won&rsquo;t. Killers of blacks have to be white to trigger that demand and a response from Eric &#8220;Unequal Justice for Some&#8221; Holder.</p>
<p>Yuck. </p>

		<p>I disagree, conceptually, with the idea that these are non-cohesive crimes.  Because all violence is constructive in terms of motive.</p>
<p>WWII: One Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor leads to a war in which 400,000 Americans are killed or wounded and as many as 2 million Japanese lose their lives.  For what?  Islands which are so useless and inhospitable that they are not held onto for one year after the war ends, despite the gallons of blood spilled in capturing them?</p>
<p>AfG:  Bombing begins almost a month after the Sept. 11 attacks.  Invasion takes place in January.  We are so contrived in our desire to _end the fight_ that we allow tribal Afghan forces KNOWN to have long been paid off by UBL, to form part of the defensive perimeter around Tora Bora.  And the big sleeze gets away.</p>
<p>Iraq:  After two years spent trying to get our ducks in a row, we invade.  Nothing there in the way of WMD.  If it ever -was- there, it was shipped out to Syria (who have an ENORMOUS chemical program) no more than six months after 9/11.</p>
<p>The point being that people contrive hatred by steps.  It may or may not serve an overarching purpose but the notion that: &#8220;If threatened by a black man, you go out and shoot someone totally unrelated and _helpless_ as being &#8216;non-cohesive&rsquo; as a strategy is to completely ignore the reality of building a polar power block by individual acts as exactly the kind of stupidity that whites also engage in.</p>
<p>Only on a larger scale.</p>
<p>Without the &#8216;us first&rsquo; determinism to stand by their actions (112 billion barrels of justification in Iraq, plus another 20-40 more in unexploited reserves).</p>
<p>In this it is CRITICAL to acknowledge that, from seemingly random acts, a consensus can and will be built.  And once a given blood-inertia has built up, anyone who is seen as not suffering enough in a common blood war can and will be engaged, secondarily, either as the first pop group is finished off.  Or as a means to expand the racial conflict and thus hope to dilute it&rsquo;s intensity at the existing combatant parties.</p>
<p>There are examples of this in history as well.  WWI.  And the Persian Gulf War where Iran started mining outside the straits of Hormuz, specifically to get Lloyds to shut down the defacto support of Iraqi goals via the Earnest Will reflag/escort efforts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think that random initiatives can&rsquo;t have organized outcomes.  The tendency of human reason to apply weighting to things almost always assures that interpretive psychology assigns meaning to what didn&rsquo;t originally have it.</p>

		<p>This unprovoked murder was not a means to an end, such as part of a drug sales operation; the murder was itself an end.  This was territorial aggression.  Mexicans have been permitted to tell themselves that southern California and the once-nice cities we Anglos built there is &#8220;theirs&#8221; and that they are entitled to ethnically cleanse their chief competitors for government services and handouts: the blacks, whom they will either kill or terrorize into leaving.  When this group of thugs was unable to intimidate one black guy by simply outnumbering him, since he was armed, they gunned down the first unarmed black they could find.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The problem with your analysis is you identify specifically WHITE tendencies and behaviors as HUMAN and then generalize them to non-whites without looking at their behavior.</p>
<p>Both whites and non-whites can be incredibly violent.  However, there are some major differences that can be observed in behavior.</p>
<p>Whites almost always have a reason behind violence&hellip;..either a goal in mind or a specific grievance or pattern of grievances the violence seeks to address.  Almost always these are positive in nature, but even when they are negative, this pattern holds.  You did something I don&rsquo;t like so I hit you.  You have something I want, so I take it.</p>
<p>Non-whites are different.  This is more or less obvious depending on the non-white group.  The most obvious group is Africans.  War, for them, is rarely about a goal.  Rarely a reaction to something.  Crime for them is almost never utilitarian.  They do it because they are bored.  They do it because they have a pathological impulse and they just go with it.</p>
<p>Violence is not directed at &#8220;enemies&#8221; or even &#8220;others&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s just directed at whomever happens to be around.  And even those who have gathered together to victimize someone else will fall on eachother with the very slimest of excuses, as this article shows an example of.</p>
<p>Racial conflict gives a handy excuse for what white people view as ethnic cleansing and conflict.  But this assumes racial solidarity.  The truth is, if you forced the two groups to separate, they would fall on themselves.  If you started offering tiny rewards (like a vial of crack and a sandwich) these people would hunt each other to extinction.</p>
<p>That is the point.  Something to keep in mind if war breaks out between them and us.  They won&rsquo;t fight for each other.  In fact, they will run&hellip;.every man for himself.  MANY can be bribed to destroy each other.</p>
<p>In fact, US war tactics revolve around this fact.  Something else to keep in mind.  The supposed goal is to stabilize the middle east and create sane, cohesive governments friendly to the US.  All that is lies.  How can any group, the larger part of which can simply be bribed to destroy their own, ever hope to achieve anything even remotely like that?  They cannot.  The goal is to destroy them.  Ramp up the lack of cohesiveness and sow chaos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been very successful.  Which begs the question, why are we doing it?</p>
<p>When it becomes necessary to do this to the Mexicans, the reasons will be obvious.  Not so obvious why we are doing it elsewhere.</p>
<p>But we are doing it.</p>

		<p>The only thing unusual about this article is that it was reported at all.  Generally the controlled governmedia prefer to ignore racial violence for which White people can&rsquo;t somehow be blamed.</p>
<p>I believe it was Tom Chittum who predicted long ago that widespread racial violence will begin with open warfare between blacks and mestizos, probably in the southwest.  The Ruling Elite seems to know this as well, and tries hard to keep knowledge of black/brown hatreds under the radar.<br>

		<p>This is no organized warfare,race war,blah blah blah! What nonsense! This is a pack of stuid people who have united,based on race, to get money and girls w/o working attacking another group of stupid people. When the Stupid organize,violence is sure to follow. There is not going to be any race war twixt the two beloved minorities,(whom,I might add, like the Muslems, acc. to our dear president,have made ENORMOUS contributions to America,lol) but never ending crime and competition for drug money. In Chicago,black gangs routinely shoot each other,black &#8220;yoofs&#8221; daily killing each other,mexies killing each other all the time,too. One young chico was shot to death and his body burned(!!)by his fellow &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; for gang reasons. That happebed across the street from where I used to live,btw. Not war,just crime. Endless crime,endless programs,endless education,endless reforms&hellip;</p>

<p>I agree with Sonya that Hispanic/black crosses often tend to go with the Hispanic side and reject their blackness.  This is very true with Arab/blacks as well. They would be highly insulted to be called black.</p>

___</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that black/brown violence will be first to appear  on the boob tube.  As you already said above, the Powers That Be  in the media are desperate to cover up any black/brown friction, because it doesn&rsquo;t fit into their Marxist  matrix of happy folks &#8220;of color&#8221; all getting along together, united in their common struggle against the evil, oppressive White Man.</p>
<p>And incidently, we should take note that just as Hispanics show no hesitation about attacking blameless groups of blacks who have done nothing to them, they could just as easily be attacking whites too, if given the motive and the accessibility.  We are generally just farther removed from them (geographically) than blacks are. So blacks, at least for now, get the brunt of it. But we can&rsquo;t take that always for granted. </p>
<p>Ultimately, you have what they want (blacks don&rsquo;t); and they&rsquo;re going to try to take it. If they can!</p>
