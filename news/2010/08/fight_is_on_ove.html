<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=192765">Fight Is On Over <em>Another</em> Arizona Immigration Law</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Unruh, WorldNetDaily, August 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The superintendent of the Arizona Department of Public Education says his agency will consider a refusal by the school district in Tucson to videotape its &#8220;Raza studies&#8221; classes as evidence the district is &#8220;deliberately&#8221; concealing its agenda.</p>
<p>The state had asked Tucson, in view of a new state law that takes effect at the end of this year that bans promoting to students &#8220;the overthrow of the United States government&#8221; and other issues, to record its &#8220;Raza&#8221; classes this fall to document what is being taught.</p>
<p>No, said Tucson officials.</p>
<p>So the state, which starting Jan. 1 can withhold 10 percent of the district&rsquo;s state funding, confirmed it would cite that refusal when the dispute comes up for judicial review.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new law was adopted this year by the legislature and signed into law by Gov. Jan Brewer. But it largely has been overshadowed by the international furor over the state&rsquo;s plan to make illegal under state law what already is illegal under federal law  &mdash;  being in the state without permission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly said the crackdown on illegals &#8220;may not be the most controversial Arizona law about illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The additional law, Schlafly wrote, &#8220;bans classes that &#8216;promote the overthrow of the United States government&rsquo; or &#8216;promote resentment toward a race or class of people&rsquo; because schools should treat all pupils as individual Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Horne [Tom Horne, Superintendent of Public Instruction], who also is running for attorney general, and Deputy Superintendent Margaret Dugan had asked Tucson to videotape its &#8220;so-called &#8216;ethnic studies&rsquo; classes during the upcoming fall semester to provide important evidence as to whether those courses are in violation of H.B. 2281.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Though we are pleased the legislation passed, it is very unfortunate that it will not take effect until January of 2011. Margaret Dugan and I are asking the Tucson district to videotape the classes to provide evidence for an expected appeal to an administrative law judge, as to whether these courses violate H.B. 2281,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ethnic Studies curricula that will be prohibited by law are designed to promote ethnic chauvinism and there is never a time or place for that in the classroom,&#8221; Dugan continued. &#8220;The lessons divide students on the basis of their race and ethnicity, instead of promoting the fundamental American value that we are all individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Horne&rsquo;s recent letter to Carroll said that teachers and former teachers have reported the &#8220;whole inference and tone&#8221; of the &#8220;Raza Studies&#8221; was &#8220;anger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(They taught students) that the United States was and still is a fundamentally racist country in nature, whose interests are contrary to those of Mexican-American kids,&#8221; the letter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Individuals in this (Ethnic Studies) department are vehemently anti-Western culture. They are vehemently opposed to the United States and its power. They are telling students they are victims and that they should be angry and rise up,&#8221; the letter continued.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state officials charged that Tucson &#8220;has hired a group of radical socialist activists who promote an anti-capitalist and anti-Western Civilization ideology. They use ethnic solidarity as their vehicle of delivery. A climate of outright intimidation has stopped many from standing up to this group for fear of being labeled racists. &#8220;</p>
<p>Further, &#8220;Impressionable youth in TUSD have literally been reprogrammed to believe that there is a concerted effort on the part of a white power structure to suppress them and relegate them to a second-class existence. This fomented resentment further encourages them to express their dissatisfaction through the iconoclastic behavior we see  &mdash;  the contempt for all authority outside of their ethnic community and their total lack of identification with the political heritage of this country. &#8220;</p>
<p>The letter also cited a statement from Augustine Romero of the district&rsquo;s Ethnic Studies program on a television interview about why the course uses the word &#8220;Raza.&#8221;</p>
<p>His response, according to the letter, was, &#8220;So that our students could recognize and connect to their indigenous side, just like the word &#8216;dine&rsquo; for the Navajo translates to &#8216;the people,&rsquo; like the word &#8216;O&rsquo;odham&rsquo; for the Tohono O&rsquo;odham translates to &#8216;the people.&rsquo; The word &#8216;Yoeme&rsquo; for the Yoeme people translates to &#8216;the people.&rsquo; It was an attempt to connect to our indigenous sides, as well as our Mexican side. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;This would appear,&#8221; Horne wrote, &#8220;to us to be an admission, not only that the course violates the provisions of H.B. 2281, but that it was intended to do so by those who designed and implemented it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he expects that when the law takes effect after Dec. 31, the state will announce it is withholding 10 percent of its allocations for Tucson, as allowed under the law.</p>
<p>The Mexican American Studies page on the Tucson school website boasts it advocates for curricula &#8220;that is centered within the Mexcian American-Chicano cultural and historical experience,&#8221; and &#8220;promoting and advocating for social and educational transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a report in the Tucson Sentinel, one of the books in use for the classes has been &#8220;Occupied America: A History of Chicanos.&#8221; The report also cited Tucson board president Judy Burns saying, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t teach all those ugly things they think we&rsquo;re teaching.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is nothing new or shocking about the nature of the ethnic studies courses in Tuscon.  What is shocking is that in Arizona there are actually politicians who will do something about them.</p>
<p>If you want to see me have a heart attack, induced by sheer and utter surprise and amazement, have the New York state legislature pass a similar law.<br>

		<p>This kind of course is, of course, offered at the university level under such titles as &#8220;Understanding Whiteness&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;whiteness studies is &hellip; taught in 30 universities around the country from Princeton to San Francisco State. It is based on the idea that whites are born to privilege, a position used to oppress blacks, Hispanics and native Americans &hellip;&#8221; (Fox News, Feb. 15, 2006) </p>
<p>Harvard University is a pioneer: </p>
<p>&#8220;Make no mistake about it: we intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as &lsquo;the white race&rsquo; is destroyed  &mdash;  not &lsquo;deconstructed&rsquo; but destroyed,&rdquo; says a scholar at Harvard&rsquo;s W. E. B. Dubois Institute (Harvard Magazine, September-October, 2002). <br>

		<p>What could they do if they overthrew the white power structure? Institute nationwide affirmative action for both government and private business? Fill the schools with anti-white and pro people of color propaganda? Distribute government aid exclusively to non-whites and non-white special interest groups while banning white interest groups. Send foreign aid exclusively to non-white nations? Place entire areas, even entire cities now, off limits to whites, while no similar areas for who whites don&rsquo;t exist, they must always must embrace &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, they&rsquo;re just too evil.</p>
<p>Wait&hellip; those things are already happening. </p>
<p>Frankly, the only ones who stand to lose from a non-white takeover are the few remaining white liberal civil service members and diversity &#8216;experts&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>State legislatures should be more concerned about what is going on in the mainstream classes. Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza pointed out in his book &#8216;illiberal education&rsquo;, the activist agenda of the 1960&rsquo;s eventually became the real agenda of the university and a part of the curriculum. Less distressing, university administrators will invite these activist groups to help form the diversity agenda, and the school paper will report on all of their events as &#8216;news&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s no word from white student groups on campus because they don&rsquo;t exist, whether the campus is 99% white or 1% white. </p>

		<p>Well, Judy Burns, if you&rsquo;re not teaching &#8220;all those ugly things they think we&rsquo;re teaching&#8221;, then why not let them videotape? What is the big deal if there is nothing to hide?</p>
<p>Anti-capitalist and anti-Western Civilization ideology is being pushed through out this country, from the majority of our media all the way up to the highest office. Do we really need it taught also? I for one do not want to live in a socialist country. Good job, Gov.Brewer. </p>

		<p>It might be tempting to just blame this on &#8216;leftists&rsquo;. After all, there must be conservatives in Mexico who disagree with La Raza just as much as conservatives do in the US. And they remember that the United States enforced the Monroe Doctrine for much of it&rsquo;s history (something unlikely to be taught in this ethnic studies class for sure) but there&rsquo;s something going on here larger than just left and right. This course is about &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; or as it was known before, anti-colonialism. Or as black activist Eldridge Cleaver described it, &#8220;I felt there was something blind and indiscriminate about his total condemnation of the white race and total absolution of people of color&#8221;. </p>
<p>The total condemnation of the white race and total absolution of people of color is called by them &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo;. It generally goes a long way toward getting you an A on your paper. </p>

		<p>These absurd La Raza classes are the logical outcome of public education&rsquo;s embrace of diversity as a &#8220;value&#8221; worthy of primary importance in education. Do these kids recite the Pledge of Allegiance, and more importantly, do they understand the words?<br>
(Rhetorical questions).  </p>
<p>Test these kids on the key events of US history, i.e., Plymouth, Jamestown, the development of the West, the railroads, industry and virtues of capitalism, famous inventions of Americans,WWII and the Cold War, and you&rsquo;ll get a &#8220;Huh?&#8221;, or whatever &#8220;Huh&#8221; is in Navajo.</p>
