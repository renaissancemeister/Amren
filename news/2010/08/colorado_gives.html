<h1>Colorado Gives Illegal Immigrants Unemployment Benefits</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>JudicialWatch, August 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Colorado pays illegal immigrants unemployment insurance because a director at the state agency that cuts the checks eliminated a key tool designed to prevent payments from going to unqualified residents.</p>
<p>As a result the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) regularly makes unemployment insurance payments to illegal aliens and other citizens who don&rsquo;t qualify for the taxpayer-funded benefit. {snip}</p>
<p>The CDLE&rsquo;s unemployment director (Mike Cullen) actually issued an official work order in early 2009 to shut the system down. The order, which was given &#8220;top priority,&#8221; forced the agency&rsquo;s information technology department to reset the software so that it stopped questioning the immigration status of applicants.</p>
<p>{snip} The move violates a 2006 state law that mandates that certain government benefits  &mdash;  including unemployment insurance  &mdash;  be denied to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>A few days after the story hit the internet, the head of the CDLE said that state lawmakers were actually notified earlier this year that the department shut down the immigration screening tool because it was causing a backlog. With a record number of unemployment claims, the screening tool was &#8220;holding everything up,&#8221; according to the agency&rsquo;s director.</p>
<p>It appears that many at the agency knew they were violating state law. {snip}<br>

		<p>Who&rsquo;s behind this? Follow the money.</p>
<p>The chief beneficiaries would be landlords and developers, into whose pockets most of the social welfare benefits end up.</p>
<p>Property holders are the keenest when it comes to influencing public policies which indirectly effect their revenue streams.</p>
<p>Slumlords love social welfare, because it facilitates the transfer of large sums of tax-payer money into their pockets.</p>

		<p>Criminal prosecution is in order for violating that law.  Moreover, a second charge should be added as to aiding and abetting fraud for each and every person given unemployment compensation who is an illegal and by law not entitled to it.  IF there was a genuine backlog, and that&rsquo;s IF, then that backlog came about by workplace slowdown - meaning a deliberate policy of dragging feet to create the backlog.<br>

<p>Colorado is one of the 46 states that is on the verge and cannot meet budget figures for the coming year.</p>
<p>If they think they have money to give away to foreigners, go for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be playing taps over their dead state as soon as it rolls over and dies for lack of revenue and irresponsible spending.</p>

		<p>It is easy for a State Agency to verify the validity of an SSN through the SSA.  If the name, DOB and sex do not match the applicant should be asked for secondary verification of their identity.  Most SSN verifications will go straight through with no problem.  Occasionally the SSA messes up (I saw a case where the SSA had a man down as a woman).  When the entire nation is crumbling under debt it is time to strictly enforce eligibility regulations.</p>

		<p>As a Colorado man of several decades, I gotta&rsquo; say it&rsquo;s been heartbreaking to see the Mestizo invasion turn this place into what it has become.</p>
<p>It was so clean, open, free, safe and beautiful two decades ago.</p>
<p>Then One day I saw a load of Mestizos in a pickup truck in Colorado Springs in the mid 1990s. Flashback (traumatic) to my visits to Smell-ay in the 90&rsquo;s. It was creepy, foreboding. </p>
<p>Then in the discount stores, in the mid 2000s, nothing but Spanish spoken all around. And the blind-drunk Mexican men brandishing open bottles in BROAD DAYLIGHT, driving down the street. The bullets flying across whole neighborhoods filled with 100% illegals. The apartment buildings turned into barrios.</p>
<p>The Tamale saleswomen parked on the sides of the roads.</p>
<p>The South American Gangs roving the streets.</p>
<p>And now I fear the hordes are headed this way due to the implementation of part of SB1070.</p>
<p>Already, even in this mid sized town, you go to a stoplight, and count 3 of five around you are Mestizo. Latino illegal men the age of thirty practically turn their heads 180 degrees to gawk and drool at twelve year old white girls (little children!) walking down the street. Ah, DIVERSITY! It is sickening!</p>
<p>And The Mexican drug cartels are trashing our Pike national Forrest, poisoning the ground and the water, with extremely dangerous chemicals, toting machine guns, to grow dope RIGHT HERE IN OUR BACK YARDS, at least five hundred miles from the border!</p>
<p>And Denver? It&rsquo;s worse than Smell-Ay was in the 1990s.  A perfect dump.<br>
America, Colorado, R.I.P.</p>

		<p>What exactly is &#8220;immigration status?&#8221; Immigrants are people who come to another country legally, and with the full blessings of that country. Thus, we aren&rsquo;t talking about immigrants here at all. And therefore the &#8220;status&#8221; of invaders can only be one thing&hellip;trespasser and law-breaker! And they should be rewarded with benefits? </p>
<p>Only a sick, decedent people would allow such madness to go on in their midst.   </p>

		<p>Please AMREN, post this. The following is the ugly truth.</p>
<p>I live in a large apartment complex in a fashionable area of Tucson, Arizona. The complex is owned by Humberto Lopez and HSL Properties, the largest holder of rental properties in Tucson and one of Tucson&rsquo;s largest employers. Humberto Lopez is a RINO who is proactively sympathetic to the cause of La Raza. He contributed big bucks to McCain.</p>
<p>This company boldy and blatanty hires Mexican illegals for manual labor positions. No housekeeper, painter, electrician, or other day laborer speaks English, and they drive cars with Mexican license plates with two and three year old Mexican registration tags. Since SB1070 was defanged, my apartment complex has been flooded with illegals. Typically, a FRONT  moves in. He provides a face and name. He signs the lease. </p>
<p>Last week, a twentysomething couple with a baby moved in next door to me. They brought no furniture, only supermarket shopping bags and pillowcases filled with belongins. They came and went late at night, always in the dark. Visitors were innumberable. Doors slammed incessantly, and stairways rattled and wobbled under constant foot traffic. </p>
<p>Then two days ago, a group of about ten youths were bold and showed themselves and made one hell of a racket. I asked a teen if they would keep the noise down. He couldn&rsquo;t speak Engligh. Another young man walked out and shouted at me and threatened me as I stood in my own doorway. I asked if everyone in the ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT was a citizen, and I told him, after he stood inches in front of me, gesticulating violently, that I would call the police. I shut the door.</p>
<p>Very soon thereafter, a mass of folks (seniors, twentysomethings, teens, kids) filed out while toting their supermarket shopping bags and pillowcases. When the police arrived, they were all gone. </p>
<p>Here is the relevant point: This is nothing. I can relate perverse stories to you about Humberto Lopez&rsquo;s aid to the Invasion. This morning, I reported a most grave occurence involving many young twentysomething illegal Mexican males and a twelve year old White American girl. I was mocked by the officer. This officer was the second to ridicule me as I reported the questionable behavior of an illegal Mexcian twentysomething male toward a little White American girl.</p>
<p>Many elderly Whites live in this complex and have for decades, long before RINO Humberto Lopez&rsquo;a HSL Properties bought the property. Since Lopez purchased the property and added it to his scores of other very large properties, it has gone to pot! The elderly are harassed by the hispanic staff. One octogenarian neighbor who is so crippled that he can barely shuffle along with a walker was threatened with eviction by HSL because his lap dog was off leash. I asked another 75 year old vet who has lived at this property for 35 years why he feels he has been grossly abused and mistreated by Humberto Lopez&rsquo;s HSL Properties. He said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m White!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday, although I have alwasy paid my rent 3 weeks before its due date and although I am clean and neat and quiet, I was served an eviction letter which offered no explanation for the eviction  &mdash;  just 30 days and get out!</p>
<p>Since SB1070 fizzeled away, this place is filling up with large Mexican Spanish-speaking families. I asked one close to the situation what is going on. He said, &#8220;Section 8&#8221;.</p>
<p>Has Obama already made us a lawless anti-White and anti-American communist state, and are we like the frog who is unaware that he is dying in slowly boiling water?</p>
<p>I repeat, Humberto Lopez is one of the most powerful RINO&rsquo;s in Arizona. The BBB of Tucson has issued HSL a grade of &#8220;F&#8221;. Lopez recently led a &#8220;recall movement&#8221; against the mayor of Tucson. And this fellow who was born a poor Mexican peasant somehow managed to get his hands on enough dough to buy the majority of rental properties in a city of 1,000,000-plus people. Does anyone else smell the rotting stench of stinking Mexican drug cartels right in front of our naive American noses?</p>

<p>How do you like that, your tax dollars at work. Colorado has gone way downhill since the California invasion.</p>
<p> Re William:  Colorado thrived with the influx of California money William.  The building industry boomed and fed a lot of families because of it.  What your short sighted and opinionated comment doesn&rsquo;t address are the REASONS those folks left California and relocated to Colorado in the first place.  And that&rsquo;s the utter collapse of California from rampant unchecked illegal immigration. Minority gangs terrorizing communities, wages being depressed, and a shattered school system where White children are victimized on a daily basis.</p>
<p> Now the shoes on the other foot and Colorado has become a favorite destination for those same illegal immigrants and the underlying social problems they bring with them.  Colorado has become a haven for illegals wishing to escape law enforcement scrutiny in the Southern border States.</p>
<p> The Californication of Colorado as many of you deem it is nothing but a symptom of the underlying illness.  An illness wholly created by the United States Government and it&rsquo;s inability and refusal to secure our Southern border.  Colorado is just another victim, and it certainly won&rsquo;t be the last. Unless something is done now all the States will fall into Third World status from invading hordes of Illegal South American immigrants.    </p>

		<p>Years ago, (though not in Colorado) I worked for a while at a State Unemployment Office. One of our daily responsibilities was to call the Federal Gov. to confirm verification of claimant alien status. </p>
<p>If there was a problem with alien verification, no unemployment benefits were paid to the claimant until an investigation was done - which could take months. Illegal aliens - at that time - were considered to be a very serious matter as it was a rip-off to the taxpayers if they collected government benefits.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>

		<p>Frank - I can only go by the regulations in my state but I believe you are right.</p>
<p>The former employer is charged for a major amount of a claimant&rsquo;s regular UC benefits but the extensions are completely financed by state and federal taxpayers.</p>
<p>UC staff is paid by the federal government.</p>
<p>This brings up the reason I left - 15+ years ago. The big cities in our state had huge minority staffs which had an enormous backlog of work. </p>
<p>Rather than firing the inner-city dead-beats and hiring competent employees, the powers-that-be decided to send the non-whites&rsquo; undone work to our suburban offices (majority white) to be dealt with in addition to our own job duties.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t going to get any more money for doing their jobs - nor were they going to get any less. </p>
<p>That cured me of ever working another government job, again, and opened my eyes about how pro-minority the government had become. </p>
