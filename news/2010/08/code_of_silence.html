<h1>Code of Silence Corrodes Morality, Puts Blacks at Risk</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Maxwell, St. Petersburg Times, July 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For committing an act of pure decency, three black women are being ostracized by many other black people. On the night of June 29, Delores Keen, Renee Roundtree and Rose Dodson rushed outside Keen&rsquo;s apartment after they heard gunshots. They discovered two Tampa police officers, David Curtis and Jeffrey Kocab, lying together on the ground. The officers had been shot. Dontae Morris, a 24-year-old black ex-convict, would be charged in the shootings.</p>
<p>Roundtree checked the officers&rsquo; pulses, and Keen dialed 911. The three women stayed with the dying officers until others arrived. The Hillsborough County Commission honored the women for trying to help the officers.</p>
<p>Since their identities were made public, the woman have been criticized by fellow blacks almost everywhere they go, walking down the street, at local social clubs and in stores.</p>
<p>Their sin, considered by many to be perhaps the worst in American black culture, was helping &#8220;the enemy&#8221;  &mdash;  the police. You are guilty of helping the enemy in two main ways: You give the police, or another authority, information about a black person who has committed or is suspected of having committed a crime, which is &#8220;snitching.&#8221; Or, as is the case with the three women, you physically aid and comfort police in distress, which is treated the same as snitching.</p>
<p>By trying to help the officers, Keen, Roundtree and Dodson showed, in the eyes of many, that they are not &#8220;authentically black.&#8221; They are traitors to their race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The snitching ethos, or code of silence, runs so deep that many blacks who snitch or assist morally struggle with their decisions. Many apologize, while others, having acted, offer history and background as to why blacks see the police as the enemy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The code of silence has coarsened black culture, especially in low-income communities, both rural and urban. It has created an acceptance of deception, divided loyalties, made pseudo-enemies, pitted neighbors against neighbors and turned criminals such as Dontae Morris into folk heroes.</p>
<p>One of the ugliest public displays of the snitching ethos occurred last year when Anderson Cooper interviewed rapper Cam&rsquo;ron for 60 Minutes. Cooper asked Cam&rsquo;ron what he would do if he knew he was living next door to a serial killer. Cam&rsquo;ron said he would move away rather than snitch on the killer.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials agree that the code of silence is the main reason they have not solved the murders of, among others, Tupac Shakur, the Notorious B.I.G. and Run-DMC&rsquo;s Jam Master Jay.</p>
<p>In an article for New York magazine, writer Stanley Crouch, who has been condemned for advocating snitching, nicely summed up the lunacy of the code of silence: &#8220;The greatest threat to black life and limb is not the police; it&rsquo;s criminals in our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is right. Black criminals victimize their own people. And we help them. If we do not call the police, we deserve the mayhem and dysfunction we suffer. When we conceal the identity of a murderer, we endanger everyone. When we turn our backs on drug deals near our homes, we cheapen the rule of law and destroy social values. In addition to its self-destructiveness, the snitching ethos alienates us from others, putting us at odds with normal behavior.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks have only themselves to blame for giving other people good reasons to hold them in contempt. The code of silence is corrosive in every way.<br>

		<p>Blacks beg everyone else not to judge them as a group, but then most of them turn right around and engage in groupthink   &mdash;   promulgating the &#8220;no snitching&#8221; mentality through social ostracism or worse, jury nullification, etc.</p>

		<p>Why does Mr. Maxwell object to the taboo on snitching?</p>
<p>Because he thinks it&rsquo;s bad for blacks.</p>
<p>Even if blacks did not have this taboo, why should whites police or fund the policing of black neighborhoods?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in it for US?</p>

		<p>&#8220;To some Tampa blacks, women who helped dying cops &ldquo;traitors to their race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;Since their identities were made public, the woman have been criticized by fellow blacks almost everywhere they go, walking down the street, at local social clubs and in stores.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their sin, considered by many to be perhaps the worst in American black culture, was helping &ldquo;the enemy&rdquo; &mdash; the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wrong in one respect.  They don&rsquo;t consider just the police, &#8220;the enemy.&#8221;  They consider &#8220;whites&#8221; to be the enemy.  </p>
<p>If it were a group of white civilians that were shot down they would feel the same way.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that most blacks utterly despise white police for arresting them when they commit crimes, this hatred extends all the way out into the white community.  Just listening to their messages via rap tells us that.</p>
<p>People like the community organizer want people to think all that is necessary to bring about a better feeling between blacks and whites is for whites to behave better towards blacks, moronically refusing to admit any racism and hatred nowadays is exclusively owned and operated by blacks&hellip;and especially their leaders.</p>
<p>Blacks will never reach the level of proficiency of whites&hellip;or any other race for that matter&hellip;.and their inability to compete will constantly be blamed on white oppression and racism even though whites are hiring and schooling blacks who are unqualified in order to try to improve their hate-filled anti-white attitudes.</p>
<p>But all the effort is in vain.  Blacks will continue to fail, and most certainly they will continue to hate&hellip;.and they will continue to use whitey as a scapegoat for their incompetence.</p>
<p>The alternative is to admit they just can&rsquo;t cut it as a group.  But they&rsquo;re far too arrogant to EVER do that.</p>

		<p>Most blacks feel the police are &#8220;the enemy&#8221; because they are either involved in crime or closely related to criminals.</p>
<p>Recently 76 people were killed when the Jamaican police tried to arrest crimelord Christopher Coke. A US newspaper termed Coke &#8220;Jamaica&rsquo;s Evil Hero&#8221; but I wondered whether most Jamaican blacks were not also evil given that this thug was their idol? </p>

		<p>All people, races or groups who believe in this &#8220;code&#8221; need to go back to Africa. The police are not the enemy if you obey the law. Doesn&rsquo;t take long to figure why there is a division in economic or education standards amoung races. Grow up people.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s REALLY needed is a no-snitchin&rsquo; rule for white people when dealing with black behavior. A big crowd in a public place, the usual contingent of &#8220;youths&#8221; suckerpunching and intimidating everyone, and nobody sees a thing when the thugs go down bellowing and grasping their private parts.</p>
<p>Turnabout is fair play!</p>

		<p>Before you condemn the Black community, let&rsquo;s transpose the situation. Suppose someone belong to a governmental police force or NGO was attempting to disrupt and destroy a group fighting for White survival. Let&rsquo;s say this agent started a fight and was seriously injured by a member of this group who was only trying to defend himself. How much sympathy would you have for someone who helps to imprison the groups member? How much sympathy would you have for someone who endeavours to give assistance to the injured agent?  </p>

		<p>I laughed hard when I read the part about the Black code of silence. Anytime several Blacks commit a crime and one of them gets caught, the cops always announce that more arrests are pending. The reason for that is that Blacks ALWAYS snitch on their crime partners. The old joke that cops tell is that you have to slap a Black one time to make him start snitching and you have to slap him three times to make him stop.<br>
The behavior that Blacks are exhibiting in the case of these three compassionate women is nothing but typical chicken yard behavior. On a chicken yard one chicken will peck another chicken on the butt, and every other chicken who saw the chicken get pecked will also peck it on the butt. This behavior will continue until the pecked chicken has its guts dragging on the ground.<br>
Chicken yard behavior is common among Blacks. They are just bored, just like the chickens. It has nothing to do with a non-existent code of silence. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Cooper asked Cam&rsquo;ron what he would do if he knew he was living next door to a serial killer. Cam&rsquo;ron said he would move away rather than snitch on the killer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was just talking to a friend of mine the other day about a similar item. These Lane Bryant murders, six women shot, five dead, in Tinley Park, IL., have not yet been solved. Over forty cops working on the case, no suspects, no leads. And the problem is a lack of cooperation from the &#8220;community&#8221;. The &#8220;community&#8221; is a code work for black folks. They have a very good description of this evil doer. Had braided hair with green beads or something like that. Probably professionally done. The bad guy should be easy to find? But NO, the &#8220;community&#8221; is resisting.</p>

<p>This is the mistake of the &#8216;upstanding&rsquo; members of the black community. . and their white &#8216;enablers&rsquo;. Until the real problem is addressed. . the mindset that it&rsquo;s Ok to victimize whites. . black will continue to also be victims of crime. Of course, that&rsquo;s all that matters to the media and blacks themselves - a vicious circle?<br>

		<p> A wise ruler of America could rid the country of a lot of this nonsense rather quickly. He would cut all welfare to able bodied adults and women who reprodude for a larger welfare check. All these jobs illegal aliens do would be taken by these lazy drones. All criminals in prison would be forced to work at hard labor. After a hard days work, their minds will not be troubled with snitching and concern about helping the enemy. But the people who rule this country want to destroy it, so they do the opposite of what should be done.</p>

		<p>Its behavior like this that proves that blacks and Hispanics have no place in white nations, other than that of criminals, terrorists and troublemakers. That is why a white defending himself will find a whole gang of these dirt bags after him. They will always aid and abet the non-white whether he&rsquo;s instigated the violence or not. They look at everything through the prism of race, and the opportunity to hurt or kill white people. Non-whites are full of hatred towards us, much of which is unjustified, unlike the hatred I and many other whites harbor towards them. Our hatred is more than justified, it&rsquo;s with good reason.Such people are a very threat to the rule of law, and our lives. Imagine what life will be like if whites are disarmed by a non-white tyrant like Obama. We would be slaughtered without weapons with which to deter them from full scale orgies of racial violence.</p>

		<p>The code of silence is the very reason some ethnicites of peoples have never built a cohesive society.  The law and order of the law must stand over color or religous persuasion.  The blacks will never know law and order&hellip;they are tribal by color.</p>

		<p>I read an interesting article on the taboo against snitching from a Neo-Darwinist position. Suffice it to say the investigator said the ethnic payoff from increased black collective awareness of their own community- even given its criminality- and the hostility of the police is such that snitching makes biological sense. Fewer snitches means more young men, all potential breeders, still on the streets and a more discouraged police presence which means increased economic activity (drugs primarily).  More victims of crime, yes, but on balance the black community must feel it is worth it. Victimized children can always be adopted out or taken care of by extended family. Abandoned women will mate again. It takes a village, ya know.<br>
Personally, I don&rsquo;t know why the larger law abiding community pays for anything beyond a minimal police presence.</p>

<p>Clever theory, but I think the main flaw relates to a story a non-racial right-winger told me a long time ago:  If the world&rsquo;s population were 10, all were capable of reproduction, and there were 9 women and 1 man, you could have (not counting multiple births, too rare for the purposes of discussion) 9 new people every 9 months.  Reverse the scenario:  9 men and 1 woman.  You can only have one new person every nine months.  Point being, the greater % your population is women of reproductive age and ability, the faster % your population growth can be.  Conversely, the only real way to crash a population long-term is to &#8220;delete,&#8221; shall we say, women of reproductive age.</p>
<p>Apply this to our racial way of thinking, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why black violence cannot possibly lead to black self-genocide. (In spite of our hopes.) It&rsquo;s almost always man-on-man.  </p>
<p>Apply this to the theory you relayed, even if blacks start snitching and this leads to the incarceration or execution of many more black men, it won&rsquo;t lead to the incarceration or execution of black women (in fact, it might actually preclude/deter the murder of a few black women of reproductive age), and therefore not impact the black population growth rate.</p>

		<p>As several have noted in this and other article comments, blacks will never ever be able to compete on an intellectual level with whites, on average.<br>
Most blacks are almost like another species in the way they keep themselves and their communities clean.  They lack emotional maturity as well.<br>
I have friends and relatives who are cops.  Most of them are saints for going in day after day to these black neighborhoods who view any whites with a kind of open hostility one rarely sees outside a gorilla exhibit.<br>
It isnt getting better friends; it is getting worse.<br>
I am growing so weary of being blamed for their evil actions and their culture of decay.</p>
