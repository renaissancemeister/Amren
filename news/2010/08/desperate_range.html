<h1>Desperate Rangel Wraps Self in Civil Rights</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sally Goldenberg, New York Post, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Charles Rangel played the race card yesterday as he entered the final stretch of his renomination campaign before the Sept. 14 primary.</p>
<p>Speaking to scores of supporters at an outdoor celebration organized by church leaders in Harlem, the embattled Democrat described himself as a &#8220;foot soldier&#8221; in African-Americans&rsquo; struggle for equality, and urged everyone to vote for him to keep the fight alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of you remember that this fight is never, never going to end. I&rsquo;m just one of the foot soldiers; just one of those [who] fought in the march so that one day our kids [will] be able to say, &#8216;Do you remember when there was bigotry and prejudice in this country? Do you remember when there wasn&rsquo;t fairness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel faces five opponents as he battles a slew of ethics charges in Congress, including failing to pay taxes on property he owns in the Dominican Republic and not declaring investments on his tax returns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very difficult to understand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when the commander-in-chief is leading our great nation involved in two wars for people to be so overtly critical of him knowing, knowing, that the enemies of democracy are listening to that  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just not right,&#8221; Rangel said after the rally.</p>
<p>Comparing African-Americans&rsquo; gains in politics to being allowed into a meeting, Rangel said, &#8220;It won&rsquo;t be long now before they&rsquo;ll be telling our president, &#8216;You can&rsquo;t attend the meeting.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>

<p>What makes the difference whether this black liar or another black liar gets into office? </p>
<p>Crooked white politicians are rife within the system, but percentagewise blacks out num ber them shamefully.</p>
<p>With a black politican, it isn&rsquo;t a question of whether or not he is going to do something crooked, it&rsquo;s will he be able to get away with what he&rsquo;s doing until he elects to quit running?</p>
<p>A great number of them are caught and n every instance they were charged due to racism.  Amazing isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Well, of course!  We knew that was coming all along. What else, when he has no other card left to play?</p>

<p>The evasions and excuses are what never end. Remember Adam Clayton Powell?  While stuffing his pockets, he sang the same tune too.  Just a poor, persecuted black man trying to make good and help his people, being kept down by the White Establishment.  </p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve heard it all before. It&rsquo;s a broken record by now.</p>

		<p>Samuel Johnson famously said, &#8220;Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that may have been the case in England a couple of centuries ago. They didn&rsquo;t have race as an excuse, back then.</p>
<p>But in America today, race has become the last refuge of the scoundrel&hellip; certainly if you&rsquo;re non-white, that is. (As with everything else, whites are not allowed the same privilege.)</p>

		<p>Aside from the stupidity of that, there is another primary race on Sept. 14 in New York that&rsquo;s catching my attention.  Rick Lazio, long presumed Republican nominee for Governor, is now facing a hard challenge from a Buffalo businessman named Carl Paladino.  He evidently wants to repurpose abandoned state prisons so that welfare recipients can learn basic life skills.</p>
<p>My question is this:  Sbuffalonative, is this Paladino for real?</p>

		<p>I predict Rangel will win his nomination.  Blacks just LOVE when blacks rip off the system and stick it to &#8220;the man&#8221;.  They are cultural heroes.  Why would they care?  THEY don&rsquo;t pay taxes.  At all.  It all gets payed by the White Man.</p>

		<p>Milking the system.  Who is he kidding.  Pretty pathetic.  Future generations will have the job to stop this nonsense if there is a US left.  Actually, the blacks will have to milk the hispanics in the future since they are the future of this country.  Good Luck.</p>

<p>Palladino is closing the gap w/Lazio but both men are still way behind Democrat Andrew Cuomo in the polls.</p>
<p>Although Cuomo has been hurt by his support for the Ground Zero Mosque, the sad fact is that NY remains a Koolaid-guzzling Blue State.</p>

<i>My question is this: Sbuffalonative, is this Paladino for real?</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve long since given up believing what politicians say to get elected and what they do in office. </p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ve never thought much of Paladino. He defines problems in odd terms and brings up issues that just don&rsquo;t seem relevant to most people. The best he ever did for Buffalo was get rid of a couple NYS toll booths that charged people to enter the city. Other than than, he has no track record of accomplishments and he&rsquo;s running on a campaign, &#8220;I&rsquo;m as mad as hell&#8221;. How far can a trite slogan get you? </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been condemned as a racist by blacks for opposing black dominated groups such as the public school board. They mockingly refer to him as &#8220;King Carl&#8221;.</p>
<p>He never struck me as very smart or savvy. Before running for office, he sent out emails and web chain postings that showed women having sex with horses (not very smart for someone planning to run for governor). When that was reported, I thought he was unelectable. </p>
<p>New York is a blue state so Cuomo wins.</p>

		<p>Charlie Rangel may use the race card. He doesn&rsquo;t have to worry though. He like white and blacks who live high off favors from lobbyists, have little to worry if they have already been reelected many times. Harlem isn&rsquo;t going to toss him out, nor is the highly white and Asian liberal affluent West Side that he represents.</p>
<p>In fact, one thing I do like about Charlie is that over a long career he comes across as a liberal congressman who delivers for his constituents, plus for the NY Wall St financial sector. He speaks in a pure NY accent. If you heard him on the phone, he&rsquo;d sound like a Jewish politician from Queens or Long Island. I suspect he has nothing but contempt for most of the Black Caucus crowd, especially for the Southern blacks.</p>
<p>However, the problem here is not race and &#8220;I&rsquo;m above the law because I&rsquo;m black&#8221;, as is usual with a Black Caucus member. </p>
<p>Charlie is a favorite of the white liberal leadership of the House, because he&rsquo;s one of them, They have distanced themselves from him for political reasons because his pride stands in the way of his resignation. But Nancy Pelosi probably wouldn&rsquo;t resign in similar circumstances either. She comes from an Italian political machine in Baltimore and now repesents the left elite of the Bay Area. She is pretty bad at admission of error too.</p>
<p>Our Congress in general is corrupt, lives off lobbyist payoffs and payments in kind. It travels incessantly on the taxpayer dime, without tangible benefit to the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Rangel is the exception to the rule that most blacks, whether or not they get freebies from folks with business before Congress, shouldn&rsquo;t be in Congress. Blacks generally, with the very limited exception of a Clarence Thomas or Thomas Sewall, don&rsquo;t understand the purpose of limited government and liberty established in 1787. Indeed, they don&rsquo;t want to understand what American liberty is about, because it doesn&rsquo;t include massive federal freebies. That&rsquo;s why they love Prez Hussein.</p>
<p>Finally, unlike today&rsquo;s young black men, Charlie did his youthful killing in Korea as a Marine in the service of his country. Unlike the late murderer Ted Kennedy, Charlie killed Commie Reds, not naive young women entranced by that ultra-liberal Kennedy &#8220;magic&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Rangel is just another black thug that got caught with his hands in the cookie jar.  After years of stealing from American tax payers along with all his criminal and corrupt activities he now has the nerve to blame it all on whitey. On top of all that he is now running once again for Congress when he should be in jail.  Really nothing new here, just more of the same old &#8220;help me because I am being oppressed&#8221; garbage that we have heard a thousand times before when it is in fact idiots like Rangel that oppress themselves. </p>
