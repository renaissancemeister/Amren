<h1><a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/south_brunswick_school_board_a.html">South Brunswick Schools to Close for Two Muslim Holy Days</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Haydon, Star-Ledger (Newark), August 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As a Muslim growing up in East Brunswick, Atiya Aftab missed classes and had to make up school work to be with her family on two important holidays: Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, and Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a decision that sent ripples of hope across the Muslim community well beyond New Jersey, the South Brunswick Board of Education has approved school closings in the 2010-11 school year for two Islamic holy days.</p>
<p>To Aftab, it was an acknowledgment Muslims &#8220;are part of the community fabric.&#8221;</p>
<p>To South Brunswick school board president Matthew Speesler, it was time the district needed &#8220;to recognize&#8221; the two Muslim holy days and the Hindu new year, Diwali.</p>
<p>About 10 of the nearly 600 school districts in New Jersey acknowledge Muslim holy days as official school holidays, according to the New Jersey School Board&rsquo;s Association. Paterson&rsquo;s school calendar recognizes them. Passaic&rsquo;s calendar includes Diwali, but not the Islamic holidays. Atlantic City lists Ed al-Fitr but not Eid al-Adha. Other districts that have closed for the holidays include Irvington, Prospect Park, Cliffside Park and Plainfield.</p>
<p>The school calendars in Woodbridge and Edison, which have large Asian populations, make no mention of the Muslim holy days.</p>
<p>In New York City, the issue of honoring Muslim holidays is political and controversial. Last month, the City Council passed a non-binding resolution calling for school closings on the same two Muslim holy days, but Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who controls the school district, has opposed the closings for reasons he said have nothing to do with Islam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two holy days this year fall on dates convenient for schools to close. Eid al-Fitr is Sept. 10, a day many schools will close for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year. The other Muslim holiday, Eid al-Adha, is Nov. 16, and will be scheduled as a staff development day.</p>
<p>The district also determined it had a large enough population of Asian Indians that the holiday would affect many of the district&rsquo;s children. While not all Asians are Muslim, many do adhere to the faith. Middlesex County has the state&rsquo;s highest concentration of Asian residents  &mdash;  151,160 or 19 percent of the total population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. New Jersey is also home to an estimated 100 mosques and between 400,000 to 600,000 Muslims, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p>

		<p>&#8220;While not all Asians are Muslim, many do adhere to the faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The majority of the world&rsquo;s people  &mdash;   nearly 3.8 billion out of nearly 6.8 billion  &mdash;   live in Asia, with nearly two thirds of those Asians living in just the world&rsquo;s two most-populous countries, China and India. Even overlooking the plain idiocy of using &#8220;Asian&#8221; in this and other Western nations as a racial or ethnic indicator, the fact remains that only about a quarter of Asians in the world profess the Muslim faith. The make up of so-called &#8220;Asians&#8221; in this country is much more heavily East Asians and Southeast Asians than South Asians, who predominate as &#8220;Asians&#8221; in Britain. Among the former, Islam is not worth mentioning as a religious phenomenon. Among the newer influx of South Asians, Indian Hindus probably far exceed Muslims, be they from India or, more likely, Pakistan, or elsewhere. To close down the schools  &mdash;   and, eventually, all of government  &mdash;   just to appease every tiny demographic minority that is being foolishly admitted into this country will eventually make running our necessary public institutions impossible altogether.</p>

		<p>Even though this Arab guy (oy, a doctor, no less!)keeps showing up to the Baltimore County school board meetings, we aren&rsquo;t closing for Muslim &#8220;holy&#8221; days yet. This Arab doctor just doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand that Baltimore County closes for the Jewish holidays beause 1) lack of students in certain high schools and 2) not enough substitute teachers to cover other absences in high schools. It&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re playing favorites  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s because they can&rsquo;t get coverage.</p>

		<p>In muslim countries, it is virtually impossible to get anything done that needs to be done in a government office for the entire 30 days, and for some days after during the post ramadan recovery days&hellip;With all the  blacks converting to muslims in the U.S. and most governments at ANY level being mostly, if not all, black, look for the increased level of ineptitude and slothfulness indemic to blacks compounded by the muslim ideaology now.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see a problem. If enough families want to take a specific day off, then it should be a holiday. Personally, I&rsquo;m willing to go fishing on the religious holiday of every ethnicity from the Ashanti to the Zapotec. Got to admit, though, I would rather go fishing in honor of George Washington than Martin Luther King&hellip; but haven&rsquo;t been given that choice&hellip;</p>

		<p>Maybe next they can close on L. Ron Hubbard&rsquo;s birthday in order to appease Scientologists.  And then a day off in honor of Hawaii&rsquo;s volcano deities.</p>

		<p>Despite what our President thinks, the US is NOT a muslim country. It is based on Judeo-Christian ethics, not a religous philosophy whose Koran demands death for the infidel. This outrageous belief is wholly incompatible with Christianity. Muslims have built mosques all over this nation. Why not keep muslim students there and they can take all the holidays they want? Just look at Europe, especially England and see what has happened with the flood of muslims there. That is our fate unless we stop their advances. If not, the will impose sharia law on this country. People like Bloomberg in NY aid and abet them. It&rsquo;s sad to see so many leaders pander to those who serve no interests except their own.</p>

		<p>So Christians get one holiday off and Muslims get two.  I loved the United States of America.  Too bad it&rsquo;s gone.  So, when are schools going to close for Samhain, Yule, Bridgid, Eostara, Beltane, Litha, Lammas, and Mabon?  We wouldn&rsquo;t want to discriminate against Wiccans, after all.<br>

		<p>&#8220;a day off in honor of Hawaiian volcano dieites&#8221;-anon<br>
uh&hellip; that would be Pele and her thirteen sisters. She also has the thunder and lightning racket sewed up. Intersting story about a man who ran a hotel on the Volcano`s rim being chastised by National Park Police. Seems he would offer a sacrifice to the goddess every day about happy-hour to amuse the tourists. Too many empty gin bottles were being hurled into the crater&hellip;.</p>

<p>Note to all controlled governmedia propaganda stooges: there is no such race as &#8220;Asian.&#8221;  Asia is a geographical location   &mdash;   and a very large and variegated one   &mdash;   not a race.  If you&rsquo;re talking about Orientals, say so.  If you mean East Indians, say so.  If you mean Arabs, say so.</p>
<p>The manufactured PCspeak term &#8220;Asians&#8221; is designed to blur racial categories, not to describe anything.  <br>

<p>What is so unusual about people who serve nothing but their own self interests, pandering to people who serve nothing but their own self interests? NYC will be the first U.S. city to feel the bite of muslim persecution of non muslims.</p>
