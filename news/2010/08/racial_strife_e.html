			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tina Susman, Los Angeles Times, August 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt in Christian Vazquez&rsquo;s mind why he was beaten up as he headed home from work late one night, and it wasn&rsquo;t for the $10 the attackers stole from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were after me because I was a Mexican,&#8221; the 18-year-old said, his left eye still swollen shut from the assault July 31 while he was walking through Staten Island&rsquo;s Port Richmond neighborhood. As his attackers punched him, they yelled, &#8220;Go home!&#8221; and anti-Mexican slurs, according to the police report, which had a familiar ring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Vazquez was the 10th Mexican victim of a suspected hate crime in the neighborhood since April. &#8220;Why this is happening? If you ask 10 different people, you might get 10 different answers,&#8221; said Ed Josey, president of the Staten Island branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, during a march Aug. 6 led by religious and civic leaders to condemn the violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Borough President James Molinaro has attributed the violence to criminals looking for easy prey, not ethnic violence. &#8220;It could have been anybody,&#8221; he said of the victims.</p>
<p>But police say that of 11 assaults on Mexicans in Port Richmond since April, 10 are considered bias-related, and those 10 involved blacks attacking Mexicans.</p>
<p>Citywide so far this year there have been 222 suspected hate crimes, compared with 125 by this time last year, according to the New York Police Department. The Borough of Staten Island has accounted for 26; there had been 11 by this time last year.</p>
<p>Ana Maria Archila said the officials&rsquo; comments point up the challenge of tackling an ugly issue that some in the so-called forgotten borough, where leaders have been struggling to increase tourism, would rather see played down.</p>
<p>Archila is a co-director of Make the Road New York, one of several groups involved in efforts to resolve the problem. &#8220;It&rsquo;s extremely insular and it&rsquo;s extremely isolated,&#8221; she said of Staten Island, a mostly suburban island of 491,000. Best known for the orange ferry that carries commuters and tourists the five miles between Lower Manhattan and the borough, its population is overwhelmingly white  &mdash;  75%  &mdash;  but it has a growing Latino population now estimated at about 15%.</p>
<p>Archila [Ana Maria Archila, co-director of Make the Road New York] and Jacob Massaquoi, a leader in Staten Island&rsquo;s African immigrant community, said tensions had grown along with anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States, something they blame on Arizona&rsquo;s crackdown on undocumented residents and conservative commentators {snip}.</p>
<p>It probably doesn&rsquo;t help that some of the people leading reconciliation efforts have sparred publicly. In a Wall Street Journal interview last month, Josey said Mexican-owned businesses in Port Richmond were failing to hire blacks, sparking a retort from Molinaro, who accused the black leader of being biased himself. When the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., led a march for black-Latino reconciliation through Port Richmond earlier this month, Assemblyman Matthew Titone and Savino accused him of using Staten Island for personal publicity.</p>
<p>And after the Aug. 6 rally, Josey questioned why the Mexican consul general felt it necessary to weigh in on the situation. &#8220;Historically speaking, black-on-black crime has been something that happens and doesn&rsquo;t raise much attention. Now it&rsquo;s blacks attacking others, and a government representative from another country shows up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And on Wednesday, in a Staten Island neighborhood a few miles from Port Richmond, a Mexican teen-ager was robbed by a young black man armed with a knife who used racial slurs, police said. A 17-year-old was arrested.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Port Richmond has long been a gathering spot for Mexican day laborers, who would spend part of the year here before returning to Mexico. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a German bakery last year,&#8221; she [the Rev. Terry Troia of Project Hospitality] said, pointing at the Cafe Con Pan bakery on Port Richmond Avenue, one of several businesses with signs in Spanish. The elementary school&rsquo;s Latino population has boomed to nearly 70%. {snip}</p>
<p>Troia said with rising numbers of other immigrants  &mdash;  the area just got a Halal pizza joint catering to Muslims  &mdash;  thugs could find new scapegoats if the current tensions are not tamped down. &#8220;If people can get angry at Mexicans coming here, people can get angry at the next group coming here,&#8221; Troia said, &#8220;and then, nobody is safe.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The governmedia and the ruling elites are in a cold sweat over black/brown racial violence, and are desperate to cover it up and play it down wherever it occurs.  They know well that these are the opening skirmishes in a war that will sooner or later involve Whites   &mdash;   a war that will spell the end of the Great Multicultural Experiment.<br>

		<p>What, you mean the blacks themselves don&rsquo;t espouse &#8220;All Men Are Created Equal?&#8221;  Then why have we sacrificed so much for them?  </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, now I remember.  We sacrificed for them because they are Jesus and through our suffering for their sake we begin the process of atoning for our sins of segregating ourselves away from our eventual redeemers of our racism.</p>
<p><br>
They are sinless. We are sin. We need them and must overlook anything they do that makes us wonder&hellip;</p>
<p>Because while we are wondering, we are not praising the &#8220;historic, heroic, iconic, esteemed, wonderful, courageous, pioneering, trailblazing, transformative&#8221; Rosa Liar Parks and Michael King Rev., yeah, that one, who beat up women in his hotel rooms during the Civil Rights movement.</p>
<p>White must always regard blacks as victims and through that regard Whites are taught that we are the oppressors.  We need salvation through our victims.   We are all guilty of MLK&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Whites must never have White heroes, only black heroes of the Civil Rights Struggle, that is, the struggle against White racism.</p>
<p>We should never revere Robert E. Lee, because he was White and reminds us of White heroes, and give us hope that we will one day again become heroic.</p>
<p>Whites should never be allowed to develop any social identity at all that is independent of Diversity. Whites must be surrounded and infiltrated by blacks so that Whites will think Diversity is normal and non Diverse all White gatherings are Nazi rallies. </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t watch TV any longer, because the all White shows are perverted porno, and the rest are full of blacks.</p>
<p>Can you imagine just how bad life will be in America by April 2015?<br>

		<p>Why does everyone equate the value of cultural diversity with their stomachs?  The sheer insanity of the concept that &#8216;what was a German bakery last year&rsquo; somehow equates to halal pizzas today as a sign of progress is just&hellip;unbelievable.</p>
<p>I find it amazing that a black man wonders why &#8216;his people&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t coming to defend him for being a Predator when the Mexicans illegally send law enforcement personnel and mediators to fight for &#8216;their&rsquo; own.</p>
<p>Guess voting democrat doesn&rsquo;t buy as much as he thought?</p>
<p>If you want a true sign of the times, look at all those Mexican &#8216;temporary workers&rsquo; who are bringing 70% demographics change to a U.S. elementary school.</p>
<p>And I bet maybe 1 in 10 of those &#8216;only illegal for a little while&rsquo; folks speaks English.  Which is of course the real reason why there is no ethnic brother hugging.</p>
<p>Immigration Idiots to the left, Socialist Morons to the right and Conniving Neocons ahead.  And not a single bullet for any of the three.</p>

		<p>&#8220;this year there have been 222 suspected hate crimes&#8221;</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t count whites being attacked as hate-crimes, there probably have been only 222 hate crimes. Blacks are around 16 times more likely to murder whites, 30 times more likely to assault whites and over 100 times more likely to rob whites than the other way around, and yet blacks are only 2 1/2 times more likely to be charged with officially designated hate crimes. Really, when you think of those statistics, it&rsquo;s likely phony statistics account for the white crimes - er, hate crimes. Cases where the white victim wins could account the few cases of &#8216;white on black&rsquo; crime. It appears in these assault, robbery and murder rates, sometimes the &#8216;bean counters&rsquo; take a holiday. They just can&rsquo;t keep track of everything!</p>

		<p>Seventy-five percent is &#8220;overwhelmingly white&#8221;?</p>
<p>In 1965 the United States was around 90 percent white with blacks being the largest racial minority at around 10 percent.</p>
<p>When the new 1965 Immigration Act was being debated, the Americn people were assured by Senator Ted Kennedy and every editorial I could find that the new law would not change the racial or ethnic balance in the U.S.  The purpose of the law, it was said, was to eliminate some minor injustices and make it easier for families to be reunited.</p>
<p>Just like affirmative action was originally intended to favor a black applicant over a white applicant for a job only if the black were equally qualified.  That quickly changed to proportional representation, quotas, and &#8220;race norming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like there were &#8220;weapons of mass distruction&#8221; in Iraq.</p>
<p>I called Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s office at the Capitol several years ago and asked the man who answered the phone if Senator Kennedy had ever apologized for misleading the American people.  The man said race didn&rsquo;t make any difference, one person was just like another, and no one really cared about it any more.</p>
<p>He was right about no one really caring.  That&rsquo;s why 75 percent is now considered &#8220;overwhelmingly white&#8221; with much further to fall.  </p>

		<p>I live in this area and Blacks have been attacking whites there for 20 years. Of course nobody cared about that. It&rsquo;s only now that Blacks have started to attack a race of people who are just as racially conscious as they are that we hear about it. Also, don&rsquo;t let these stories fool you. Many of these Mexicans are drug dealers and all around bad people themselves. The fact that these articles keep portraying them to be the embodiment of &#8220;the Huddled masses&#8221; is such a lie.  I predict that gangs such as MS 13 and the Latin Kings will increase due to this and then Staten Island will be FINISHED&hellip;a No Go Zone.</p>

Mexicans on average have lower IQ&rsquo;s when compared to blacks but<br>
have built a track record of reliability as slave laborers<br>
to international corporations.<br>
So as the Mexican population rises over time, corporations will replace blacks as a worthy minority garnering further entitlements in both business and politics.<br>
Since Mexicans do not view themselves as Americans, perceive blacks as unstructured, and view the corporation as the actual government, Mexicans do not have a moral issue in the colonization and displacment of blacks in areas of Mexican colonization.   <br>

		<p>We haven&rsquo;t SEEN &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; yet. Staying with one&rsquo;s own kind is human nature (except for what part has been bred out of whites), so  soon it will be every different faction against every other faction. The more ethnicities the more competition, the more friction, the more resentment, the more violence. The world will evolve into what it used to be - and what worked - smaller groups living within your own kind. All this turmoil to find out the very thing we were trying to change was what was best.</p>

		<p>As other posters have said, I just can&rsquo;t feel sorry for blacks in this case.  They have self-righteously condemned us, regardless how much we&rsquo;ve bent over backwards for them.  They attack whites because we&rsquo;re white, yet accuse us of being bigots and are wanting us to feel sorry for hispanics attacking them because they&rsquo;re black.

		<p>An interesting statistic related to poster #8&rsquo;s comment would be that in inter-racial crime between whites and blacks, the government is X times more likely to charge a white with a hate crime when he commits a violent crime against a black, than when a black commits a violent crime against a white.

		<p>I doubt that this trend will get very far.  Mexicans generally aren&rsquo;t people who take abuse lying down.  My guess is that after a couple more such instances the Mexicans won&rsquo;t retaliate in kind; they&rsquo;ll simply start killing black gang members.</p>

<p>Too bad it&rsquo;s not broken down by ethnicity and religion.  It might open a few eyes as to how White Staten Island really is.</p>

		<p>So the guy in the article complained that mexicans &#8216;don&rsquo;t give blacks jobs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So these blacks should call the Equal Employment Opp. Commission.  Get a federal lawsuit going.  Force latinos to hire blacks, because, as many of us know who live around both groups, latinos DO NOT HIRE BLACKS for anything.  For that matter, Asians don&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>Why the white conservative movement doesn&rsquo;t make a mountain out of this is beyond me.  It could kill affirmative action because the hypocrisy of it all would be exposed when latinos and asians (and arabs) steadfastly refuse to hire blacks even under court order.</p>
<p>Hey, latinos don&rsquo;t hire white people or Asians, either, even though the reason is that no self-respecting white or asian person would want an illegal immigrant boss.  There are unwritten caste systems in america today.</p>
<p>Do black owned businesses provide jobs for latinos, whites or asians?</p>

		<p>&#8220;An interesting statistic related to poster #8&rsquo;s comment would be that in inter-racial crime between whites and blacks, the government is X times more likely to charge a white with a hate crime when he commits a violent crime against a black, than when a black commits a violent crime against a white. Can somebody please figure out what the value of &ldquo;X&rdquo; is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible to assign a numerical value to X. The probability that a white will be charged with a hate crime is 100%, even if it is only a minor or perceived crime. The probability that a black will be charged with a hate crime is 0%, even if it is brazenly hateful and obvious (i.e. Newsom murders). Maybe an actuary or mathematician could assign some imaginary infinite number to X. I don&rsquo;t have that ability, I only studied statistics and five levels of calculus.</p>

		<p>A few days ago there was yet another prison riot in a California prison  &mdash;  one so large and vicious that reinforcements had to be called in to quell the violence.</p>
<p>The local papers reported it in a very small blurb buried in the back pages, races not mentioned.  The local news channels reported nothing.</p>
<p>I would bet my paycheck that it was a hispanic-on-black riot.</p>
<p>Which brings me to this (from White is Right):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.[Blacks] have self-righteously condemned us, regardless how much we&rsquo;ve bent over backwards for them. They attack whites because we&rsquo;re white, yet accuse us of being bigots and are wanting us to feel sorry for hispanics attacking them because they&rsquo;re black&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks are only doing what the government and media have allowed them to do since the &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; Act, which I believe was not about black empowerment at all, but rather a frontal attack on White America, to weaken and destroy us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working, just as planned.</p>
<p>Blacks have been unleashed upon us by the government  &mdash;  to brutally attack, rape, and rob  us, been moved into our neighborhoods and children&rsquo;s schools specifically to destroy these White safe havens, not to &#8216;raise up blacks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hypocritical media and government have looked the other way while blacks have been allowed to commit every form of racial hate crime against Whites   &mdash;  up to and including murder  &mdash;    and publicly vilify us with complete impunity.</p>
<p>Yet the hammer comes down hard upon any White who dares to criticize blacks, including pointing out massively disproportionate black-on-White crimes such as torture-murders.</p>
<p>Is ignoring massive black-on-White crime part of black civil rights? Is allowing blacks to get away with murderous hate crimes directed at Whites part of &#8216;redressing past grievances?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Or is it part of a hidden agenda.  A well-funded, well-planned, subversive war to destroy Whites, White Culture and White America with blacks in the role of useful idiots, used as a murderous assault wave against White Americans.</p>
<p>I see it no other way.</p>
<p>Again, ask yourself:   Cui Bono? Cui Bono?</p>

		<p>I left New York City in 1989. I don&rsquo;t recall their being any Mexicans in NYC at the time. It&rsquo;s scary how rapidly areas can change. Years ago, Staten Island was a nice middle class Italian area.   </p>
