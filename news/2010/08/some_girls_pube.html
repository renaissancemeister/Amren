			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shari Roan, Los Angeles Times, August 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the paper, which appears in the journal Pediatrics, almost 25% of African American girls have reached a stage of breast development marking the onset of puberty by age 7, as had almost 15% of Latina girls and more than 10% of white girls.</p>
<p>Those percentages are significantly higher than in 1997, when a landmark study first reported that girls were beginning puberty much younger than they had in the mid-20th century. In that study, the rate of girls who had begun puberty at age 7 was, on average, 5% for whites, compared with 10.4% in the new study.</p>
<p>In other words, the average age of puberty onset still appears to be in flux.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Biro&rsquo;s [Dr. Frank M. Biro, director of adolescent medicine at Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s Hospital Medical Center and the lead author of the new study] study included 1,238 girls ages 6 to 8 who lived in one of three regions: Cincinnati, East Harlem, N.Y., or San Francisco. Puberty was determined by two examiners who worked independently to assess the girls&rsquo; breast development. By age 8, 27% of the girls had begun puberty: 18.3% of whites, 42.9% of blacks and 30.9% of Latinas.</p>
<p>Compared with data from the 1997 study, the age at which puberty begins did not fall for African American girls, although they still mature at younger ages than white or Latina girls. It&rsquo;s not clear why there was no change for black girls. &#8220;Perhaps black girls have approached a biologic minimum,&#8221; Biro said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are numerous potential explanations for why puberty is starting earlier. Chief among them is the increase in average body weight among children over the last three decades, Lee said. Excess body weight, especially body fat, is thought to increase the blood levels of estrogens that promote breast development. Earlier studies, including one by Lee, have linked early puberty to higher body mass index as far back as the toddler years.</p>
<p>But other studies suggest that body fat may not be the only cause. A Danish study released last year in the journal Pediatrics found puberty occurring earlier in children regardless of body mass index at age 7. Factors may include a diet that is increasingly high in sugar and fat, declining physical activity and exposure to endocrine disrupters, chemicals in the environment that act on hormones.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Biro said that his study would continue to follow the girls&rsquo; development, and that blood and urine samples were being collected to look at biomarkers that reflect potential environmental exposures.</p>

<p>All kidding aside, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve read the really elite mainstream media broach the race taboo when it comes to the slow decrease in the average age of puberty onset in girls.  (And boys, too, though this research doesn&rsquo;t cover them).  I have always thought that obesity and toxins are very small factors, and that the way more important factor for the decline is merely a function of race, that so many &#8220;American&#8221; girls of that age are black and Hispanic.</p>

It is interesting in regards to culture, not pure biology I&rsquo;ve met some Indian folk who will not let their teenage even young adult daughters to date. They seem to think a delay to adoloscence is beneficial in the grand scheme of things.</p>

		<p>Obesity is unhealthy and unattractive.  White parents have to stress that with their children and provide proper nutrition.  Overweight white adults need to stop making excuses and actually lose weight.  Americans are the fattest people on the planet.  Because American media is so influential, white Americans are sending a very bad message to other white people around the world.</p>

		<p>What I want to know are the answers to three questions:</p>
<p>1.  Is the breast budding issue a function of dumping excess body fat where it would naturally go or is the full range of associated physiology and behavior changes also accelerated?</p>
<p>2.  IMO, the loss of science and math interests seen in the 12-14 year old period in a lot of females is directly linkable to the estrogen plateau of menarche and is associated with the development of Corpus Callosum switching issues between hemispheres (whether inhibitory or excitative) as a function of &#8216;risk checking&rsquo; in social rather than literal intelligence interpretation.  In particular, I think that female sexual maturation reflects a deliberate, genetic not cultural suppression of literal rationalism as left side dominant expression of self vs. group identity.  If so, will this become an issue even earlier and will it correspond with decreased MA factors in exacerbating teen behavioral rebellion or have a larger role in IQ development overall?</p>
<p>3.  Does earlier puberty map out to a switch to the &#8216;live fast, breed young, die poor.&rsquo; survival moding as possibly relevant to stressed-population response to limited resources when other ethnies begin to exceed our own population numbers?  Clearly this behavior is noted, probably with evolutionary driver effects, for African groups.  But if it is present in whites does it signal a possible change in balanced (replacement level) K-breeding strategies and are there any predictable demographics shifts which could effect population numbers or cohort age ranges as a function of SES changes overall?  Not just between races but within racial subgroups?</p>
<p>Given we are putting more and more power into female demographies in terms of prestige job positions and social influence/entitlements, anything which could negatively effect mental aptitude or behavioral maturity as a function of access to these entitlements needs to be adjusted for in the social reengineering of our society.</p>

		<p>And this at a time when maturity levels seem to be on a downward trend as related to numerical age, at least in some cases.<br>
Young people shouldn&rsquo;t think because they have the accoutrements of an older person they get a pass in their own behavior.<br>
I think the job of being a parent is getting harder than it has to be, partly due to popular culture.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet an even smaller percentage of Asians than Whites reach puberty at a young age, once again reinforcing J. Phillippe Rushton&rsquo;s r/K theory that Asians are always at one end of the maturation, fertility and IQ scale, blacks at the other.</p>

		<p>Good grief, what are they putting in the water these days?  (This is not entirely a joke, there is a problem with certain chemicals that are estrogen mimics persisting in surface water.)</p>
<p>Whatever the cause is, nobody here is surprised that its consequences differ in degree among the races.  It&rsquo;s hard to find any physiological, cognitive, or cultural attribute that <i>doesn&rsquo;t<i> differ across races. </i></i></p>

		<p>This is scary not because of the racial aspect, blacks have always matured earlier, but the reasons why.  Childhood obesity is one and the other may very well be all the hormones pumped into our farm raised animals.  This may lead to health issues in later life.  I think it may also lead to a intellectual retardation.  It is well documented that some things are easier learned in youth than in adulthood.  It is impossible for humans to learn speach after puberty yet easy for toddlers to become mulitlingual.  If a child physically matures too early that may mean that the brain also physically matures, lessening its ability to learn new tasks.  It becomes less &#8220;plastic&#8221;. </p>
<p>Blacks have enough trouble learning as it is without having the handicap of physically maturing too soon.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In an evolutionary, biological perspective I wonder why this is happening&#8221;</p>
<p>This process has been in the works ever since the late 1960&rsquo;s. That is when they began routinely and to this day putting animal growth hormone in all the feed of the farm animals. Anytime these kids eat eggs, butter, cheese, milk, meat, etc., they absorb a small amount of the animal growth hormone. This all accumulates over time and only means more rapid growth in some kids of a type never seen before. Did not occur in those persons born before the late 1960&rsquo; who had already matured.</p>
<p>NOT ONLY developing breasts in girls but being able to have babies too. And WANTING to have babies as early as nine years old!</p>

<p>You misinterpret the reasons for this. The reasons are that a pretty daughter is used as a potential step in the social climbing ladder in a seriously class conscious society such as India. Most marriages are arranged, as one of my employees is on his way to India to meet his arranged bride this very week! No, social climbing is why the daughter is saved and a virgin daughter is especially valuable, as it is in the Muslim world.</p>

		<p>#8 Tim in Indiana, this has been the case in everything I&rsquo;ve read.  Note that in this LAT article, it&rsquo;s acknowledged that blacks have always been known to mature earlier than other groups.  Black babies can usually hold up their heads within 2 days, while white infants take 6 to 8 weeks to master this ability!  It&rsquo;s long been said in the South that black children reach an age at which white kids begin to pull ahead and leave them behind intellectually.  <br>
Hormones fed to meat-producing animals could certainly be a contributor to lower-age puberty onset.  Note that the article cites a &#8220;biologic minimum&#8221; below which puberty is unlikely to occur.  Blacks seem to have been, at least in modern times, at or near this minimum.<br>
What is the most dismaying thing to me is the fact that our culture, rather than our biology, is sinking down to the level of the black underclass.</p>

		<p>To #9, #11, and #12: Yes, there certainly is something in the water, and as the other two Posters have mentioned, there are plenty of homones in cattle and chicken feed, as well as cattle being injected with growth hormones, to provide more beef, and milk. </p>
<p>Now, all Whites, or at least he most intelligent of our Race, should stop buying these hormone-laced products, and actually read the labels of what they are purchasing for their meals. </p>
<p>There is no way that hormone-laced beef would end up in my Refrigerator or Freezer, nor would treated milk, cheese, heavy cream, or eggs. We buy only Organically raised beef, chicken, pork, buffalo meat, as well as dairy products. The same goes for our produce purchases. </p>
<p>We also have a garden, and several trees that produce fruit. </p>
<p>Parents need to stop taking their children to McDonald&rsquo;s and Burger King, which buys their meat at the cheapest margins, since they can, do to their buying power, much the same way that Wal-Mart does, which in turn passes the lowest quality of food on to their Consumers. Is there any wonder why children and adults are obese? Couple this with inactive children sitting in front of video games, and you could certainly be looking at a 200 pound 10 year old, which was unheard of, when I was growing up. </p>
<p>Buy a good water filter, such as an Aquasana, or other direct filtering device, and use it to remove the chlorine, sediments, heavy metals, as well as bacteria and viruses from your drinking water.</p>
<p>Remember to wash all of your produce, organic, or not, in salt water, with lemon juice, or apple cider vinegar, to kill any germs that may be on the produce, from when it was being packed for shipping, or handled at the Market.</p>
<p>Spend a little more, and buy organic food from the Farmers that take the time to grow it. You will support them, and enhance your own lives by doing so.</p>

<p>That was an unnecessarily long way of stating that women are crazy (excuse me, irrational) and naturally docile. Their minds are not made to do the same things as men. All obvious, all natural.</p>
<p>And for the record, I, a white male, entered puberty around age 8. Some folks just develop earlier than others. I also have a somewhat higher than average testosterone level, which may have been a factor in my early development.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve connected the early onset of puberty at least in part to the sexualization of little children.  We know of the Mind-Body connection.  Early sexual education and exposure to sexually provocative media programming could be exciting the body to produce hormones that cause development.  At a younger and younger age, little ones are expected to understand about sex and even mimic the behavior of those who are alrady mature and sexually developed.<br>
Of course, I could be wrong.</p>

		<p>I have always believed the onset of earlier and earlier puberty is directly linked to the rise in hormones and additives in the mainstream food supply, especially in poultry, eggs, and beef.  </p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that eating organic food and drinking truly clean water is usually only done by families with more income and education should offer no surprise to the statistics shown by this paper.  <br>

		<p>Also, if you have ever wondered why, for the first time in US history, people are actually getting SHORTER, this is one of the reasons.  (the other being that Hispanics are shorter).  Girls are at about 80% of their adult height at their first period.  In other words, once you get your period, you are not going to grow that much more.  For example, obesity in girls results in a shorter overall adult height. Any phenomenon which is making people smaller, needs to be investigated much more thoroughly.  </p>

		<p>While we&rsquo;re on this subject, one of the blogs I read on a daily basis is called Shorpy, it is basically a blog of old photographs.  A recent post a few weeks ago was showing high school students in 1920 looking at a public health booklet about &#8220;the birds and the bees,&#8221; and the booklet was mainly a circumlocution about syphilis and gonorrhea avoidance, which I imply was a bad problem in the U.S. in the post-WWI years, probably because of American soldiers bringing it home from Europe.</p>
<p>Anyway, on two of the pages, it said that the 15-17 age range was when almost all young men would start getting those involuntary nightly emissions.  Now, every illustration and photograph in this booklet were of white people, so it must mean that young white men hit puberty in the 15-17 range circa 1920.  It seems that, today, even among whites, it&rsquo;s 12-14 when that happens.  Therefore, nutrition, toxins and obesity could be playing a role, but over a long period of time.</p>
