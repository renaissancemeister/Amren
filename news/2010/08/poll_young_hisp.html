<h1>Poll: Young Hispanics Less Likely to Be Catholic</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Trevor Tompson, Saramento Bee, August&nbsp;10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An Associated Press-Univision poll finds that younger Latinos, as well as those who speak more English than Spanish, are much less likely to identify as Catholics than older Hispanics who mostly speak Spanish.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,500 Latino adults also found significant divisions on social issues such as same-sex unions and abortion, along lines of age, language and whether one is Catholic or Protestant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, 62 percent of Hispanics identify as Catholic, but that includes only 55 percent of young adults 18 to 29, compared with 80 percent of elders 65 and over.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Protestants are twice as likely to attend weekly services, according to the poll, also sponsored by The Nielsen Company and Stanford University. Many worship in evangelical or Pentecostal churches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy percent of Hispanic Protestants said the Bible is the actual word of God, to be taken literally, compared with 46 percent of Hispanic Catholics. Just 26 percent of Protestants said abortion should be mostly legal, compared with 41 percent of Catholics. And 59 percent of Protestants said same-sex couples should not be allowed to marry, compared with 29 percent of Catholics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poll found a large generation gap on same-sex marriage, with 46 percent of Hispanics ages 18 to 29 saying same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, compared with less than one-third of those in older age groups.</p>
<p>Same-sex marriage seems to be gaining acceptance in Latin America. Last month, Argentina became the first South American nation to allow it. Gay marriage is also legal in Mexico City, while same-sex civil unions granting are allowed in Uruguay and in some states in Mexico and Brazil.</p>
<p>On another divisive issue, the poll found markedly less support for legal abortion among Latinos than among Americans overall. Thirty-nine percent of Hispanics said abortion should be mostly legal, compared with 51 percent of the general population in a 2009 AP-GfK poll.</p>
<p>But there are big disagreements among Latinos. Forty-nine percent of those who speak mainly English said abortion should be legal in most cases, about the same as the proportion of the general U.S. population holding a similar view. Hispanics who mainly speak Spanish were far more conservative, with only 31 percent saying abortion should be mostly legal.</p>

		<p>Immigrants moving from an overwhelmingly Catholic country and culture into an overwhelmingly Protestant country with a secular culture are likely to become both more Protestant and more secular as a result. Those who were already more religious are more likely to be conservative; and, thus, they also are more likely to gravitate to fundamentalist Protestant groups, meaning evangelicals and Pentecostals, than to mainline Protestantism. Older people are less likely to learn a new language, and are also more conservative by nature; but, they are less likely to leave a religion that they have belonged to throughout both their childhood and a longer adulthood. Religious affiliations otherwise, however, have a great deal to do with the orthodoxy instilled through family and community; and, once an immigrant leaves both behind in the old country, he or she is under far less influence and pressure to maintain that old-time religion. &#8220;When in Nova Roma&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>A few years ago I watched a television report about prisons in South America(Brazil and Peru in particular).The gist of the report was that the authorities were encouraging the conversion of the inmates to protestantism,as were perceived as less likely to re-offend.Are there any statistics regarding the Hispanic population of the USA to support this?.</p>

		<p>These Mexican illegals do not practice Catholicism in Mexico! Their version is much different than what we are led to believe. As for these mexican immigrants being &#8220;conservative&#8221; is another misnomer. Their idea of &#8220;conservatism&#8221; is not our idea of conservatism.</p>

		<p>There seems to be a trend where Catholic nations, notably in South America, are becoming less Catholic, while Protestant nations like England are becoming more Catholic. </p>

		<p>Mexico isn&rsquo;t even a Catholic Country. The Catholic Church lost two civil wars against a revolutionary socialist government. The first was against Benito Juarez on the part of Maximilian Hapsburg in the 1860s, and the second was the Cristero Rebellion of the late 1920s who were sold out by the Vatican and their own bishops. The border should be shut to stop future liberal voters from entering the country. Most Mexicans are Revolutionary and Communistic, not Catholic. </p>

		<p>In my voluminous experience with latino youths of all stripes, here are my on-the-ground observations:</p>
<p>1) Rural mexicans tend to be more catholic by verbal profession, but just as likely to violate catholic teachings as anyone else.  Most gangabangers are more Indian in their mestizo-ness.</p>
<p>2)  Latinos who are protestants ARE actually more responsible and lead more moral lives.</p>
<p>3)  The average Latino from the Caribbean has nearly zero knowledge or practice of Christianity of any kind, despite what they say.</p>
<p>4)  There is a significant number of latinos who profess to be athiests.</p>
<p>5)  95% of all latinos, regardless of faith expression, see no problem with sex outside of marriage, selling illegal things, working under the table, getting &#8216;free&rsquo; things or using racial prejudice to their advantage.</p>

		<p>Primitive people tend to pervert Christian teachings. Just go to Africa, and try to find good Christians there. You will be going on a wild goose chase (unless of course you stumble across some Afrikaners in Johannesburg). Blacks in the Caribbean, and darkies in South America, also tend to be religiously deficient, or so are my observations. For example, the Catedral de la Nuestra Senyora in Acapulco, Mexico, has - brace yourself - a GIFT SHOP! I&rsquo;m not kidding, it seriously has a gift shop at the front of the narthex or nave (I always get the two confused)! Also, despite the fact that its a Catholic Cathedral, it is designed like the Church Of Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) in Constantinople (Istanbul), a Greek Orthodox Church. Now of course, the archbishop is white (Spanish), but if the people were good Catholics/Christians, then they wouldn&rsquo;t accept such nonsense as a gift shop in a church. I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re all heathens, I mean I did see one Zapotec nun who looked like she truly understood her religion - but most just sat there like dazed, uncaring zombies.</p>
