			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Farhi, Washington Post, August 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Laura Schlessinger, the blunt-spoken, sometimes controversial radio talk-show host whose racially charged comments drew widespread condemnation last week, said Tuesday that she will end her radio career at the end of the year.</p>
<p>The announcement by the host of the &#8220;Dr. Laura&#8221; program was a stunning denouement after a week in which Schlessinger was widely criticized for describing an African American caller to her program as &#8220;hypersensitive&#8221; for taking offense at a neighbor&rsquo;s racial taunting. To illustrate her claim of a racial double standard, she said that black comedians often use the N-word on TV without criticism, but the word is forbidden for white people. She used the racial epithet, unexpurgated, 11 times in five minutes, despite her caller&rsquo;s protests.</p>
<p>Schlessinger later apologized for the remarks, saying she said &#8220;the wrong thing&#8221; on the air. On Tuesday she went further: During an interview on &#8220;Larry King Live&#8221; on CNN, Schlessinger said, &#8220;My contract is up for my radio show at the end of the year, and I&rsquo;ve made the decision not to do radio anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;The reason is, I want to regain my First Amendment rights. I want to be able to say what&rsquo;s on my mind and in my heart and what I think is helpful and useful without somebody getting angry, some special-interest group deciding this is the time to silence a voice of dissent and attack affiliates, attack sponsors. I&rsquo;m sort of done with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although she said her sponsors and affiliates have backed her, Schlessinger, 63  &mdash;  who holds a PhD in physiology from Columbia University  &mdash;  told King that she lived in &#8220;constant fear&#8221; that critics would attack them for her remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never called anybody a bad word. I was trying to bring  &mdash;  and obviously it has become a national discussion now  &mdash;  I was trying to make a philosophical point,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And I made it wrong, but I wasn&rsquo;t dissing anybody. {snip}&#8221;<br>

		<p>I listened to Dr. Laura for a little while, at about the point when she was actually beating Rush Limbaugh in the ratings for one ratings period.  But I gave her up for good when she started preaching about how horrible it was for people to oppose interracial marriage.</p>
<p>IMHO, she had this coming.</p>

		<p>I have to disagree here with Laura Schlessinger.  Quite a few years ago she made a comment that homosexuality was a &#8220;biological mistake&#8221; and was hounded off the New York airwaves for that comment.  Although calling homosexuality a &#8220;biological mistake&#8221; may have been an &#8220;indelicate&#8221; way of stating her point of view, in that instance she was denied her first amendment rights.  Why?  Because she was stating her view of why or how a small percentage of people turned out to be gay.  The &#8220;born that way&#8221; view is held by both many scientists and doctors as well as the majority of gay people themselves. The criticism of her remark was unjust because she was stating a widely held view in a &ldquo;politically incorrect&ldquo; manner.  In this case, however, the criticism is justified for a couple of reasons.  The first amendment does not protect vulgar or obscene speech.  The &#8220;N&#8221; word is generally considered vulgar.  Regardless of one&rsquo;s opinions of blacks using the &#8220;N&rsquo; word is coarse and crude and society has become coarse enough without a so-called professional moralist adding to it.  Secondly everyone knows that only a member of the group in question can use a disparaging term about that group.  There are blacks who do not approve of the use of the &#8220;N&#8221; word by other blacks let alone non-blacks.  </p>
<p>If she truly thought using the N-bomb eleven times in five minutes was OK she is either incredibly naive or incredibly stupid.  This isn&rsquo;t about first amendment rights this is about common sense and good taste, neither of which the good &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; has.<br>

		<p>Well, some will accuse Schlessinger of caving in because she apologized, but I respect her for bringing the issue out into the open. Although some would argue that it is possible to challenge racial orthodoxy and still keep a radio show, resigning from her show is a strong form of protest, and if more public figures spoke out about our loss of freedom of speech and association, the public might finally start to notice what has been going on in this country for so long.</p>

		<p>Laura did the response to the listener with tact and poise. She used the words in a polite and respectful context but the Left and African American community see it as their constitutional right to control the use of this word.  Unfortunately this is just the FIRST of many words that will be controlled by the Left. </p>

If her point was to re-gain her 1st amendment right of free speech, she gave away all her integrity by apologizing.</p>

<p>Look, that gutless idiot Dr. Laura&rsquo;s first mistake was to apologize at all; next, as is expected, she compounds her problem by deciding to cut and run from it following the apology. If she honestly thinks that this will &ldquo;regain&rdquo; her &ldquo;First Amendment rights,&rdquo; then gutless idiot is far too optimistic description of her. It would be something more like mindless and drooling zombie, that would best illustrate her feckless wretchedness.</p>
<p>Well, I hope this fool enjoyed fame while she had it, because now she will be in a Dante&rsquo;s Inferno of the multicultural elitists&rsquo; excommunication, and the white middle class&rsquo; disgust or outright indifference toward her from this point forward.</p>
<p>Maybe she will get a guest spot on &ldquo;Dancing with the Stars&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prancing with the Bizarre&rdquo; in the future, but that is likely (and thankfully) where it will all end for her?</p>

		<p>It seems safe to say that a large cross-section of America is getting completely fed-up with all this hypersensitivity and politically correct nonsense. Even among those who would never intentionally utter an unkind word about a non-white, we see a frustration with all of this foolishness. That doesn&rsquo;t do much for our cause, but at least it&rsquo;s a start!</p>

<p>The only &#8220;types&#8221; of speech not afforded First Amendment protection are those words or statements directed at a particular group of persons present, wherein the speech is intended to incite immediate criminality or behavior likely to result in injury (such as the famous quote from Justice Holmes about falsely shouting &#8220;Fire!&#8221; in a movie theater).</p>
<p>The First Amendment also excludes any speech considered to be &#8220;fighting words,&#8221; such as words directed at a specific person, who is present, and wherein the words, when spoken, are plainly meant to induce a physical altercation or other immediate breach of the peace. <br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be a smart aleck, the &#8220;N&#8221; word was a racial eptithet 50 years ago when I was a little kid.  My mother would have washed our mouths out with soap for using that word.  That was well before political correctness came on the scene.  In post-war America that word has only rude, vulgar connotations and should not be used on the public airways by anyone.  Just because blacks use the word doesn&rsquo;t mean we, as whites, should debase ourselves by using no-class language.</p>
<p>Using the &#8220;N&#8221; word just accelerates our societal race to the bottom. And the good &#8220;Doctor&#8221; should have known better!</p>

<p>Perhaps legally I am wrong but morally I am right.  I don&rsquo;t want to hear the &#8220;N&#8221; word, or the &#8220;F&#8221; word or any of the other vulgarism which have become part and parcel of third world America.  </p>
<p>I want the &#8220;white bread&#8221; America of my youth back. I want good manners, safe public schools and a common culture of decency to return.  Dr. Laura does not deserve to be defended by any decent white American for her vulgar out burst.</p>

		<p>Are there words and phrases that some people use or have used in reference to white people that we are absolutely forbidden to utter in public? I can think of several derogatory terms, but they&rsquo;re hardly off-limits. In fact, I&rsquo;ve seen some of them used casually in comments on this site. </p>
<p>If derogatory racial references are wrong, they&rsquo;re wrong no matter which race they refer to or which race uses them. Otherwise, we have yet <i>another</i> racial (and racist) double standard. </p>
<p>This &#8220;N-word&#8221; business is an example of a double standard. </p>

		<p>Dr. Laura is wrong for apologizing and wrong for leaving the airwaves.  As long as Blacks continue to toss the &#8220;N word&#8221; around like they do, Whites should reserve the equal right to use that word wherever and whenever they feel it appropriate.  That being said, I would also say indescriminate frequent use of that word by anyone of any color, only serves to lower their own image.  My feeling is, if certain Blacks think certain other Blacks are deserving of that word, then why shouldn&rsquo;t I also be able to think so.  Who knows better they they what descriptive noun best fits certain of their own?  I hear Blacks using the &#8220;N word&#8221; all the time, in their every day conversation and especially in their music, and I use the term &#8220;music&#8221; loosely.  Whites have allowed this word to be used as a weapon against them to the point of insanity.  O.J. got away with murder, partly because the &#8220;N word&#8221; was used to establish to a certainty that Mark Feuhrman was a racist.  The prosecution should have put their Black lawyer, I forget his name, on the witness stand and asked him under oath if he had ever used the N word to describe any Black.  His answer would have been yes and at least some of the steam would have been left out of that issue.  Feuhrman, on the other hand, should never have denied using it.  His cowardly lie helped do him in. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve drifted a long way from Dr Laura.  I wish she would hang in there.  I wish she would fight for her first amendment rights on the radio, her battlefield, where her army of supporters can stand up with her.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between choosing not to use a word and being forbidden to use a word.</p>
<p>Anyone who finds a word offensive or distasteful needn&rsquo;t use it. It&rsquo;s completely different to demand others not use a word you may dislike.</p>
<p>Some may consider it an ugly word but I don&rsquo;t agree that we should give that word such power that it can destroy people who may use it under any circumstance.</p>
<p>Dr. Laura was trying to point out the obvious double standard we find ourselves in; he can use a word that I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If blacks can say it, Dr. Laura and I can say it without PC repercussions.<br>

		<p>I admire Dr. Laura for her being a children&rsquo;s advocate. All day<br>
day-care is not good for children, for instance, and she has the<br>
guts to say so. She also advocates that women be better wives; in<br>
this age of women&rsquo;s liberation run amuck, it is certainly a<br>
politically incorrect stance to take.<br>
 <br>
Concerning homosexuals, to her credit, she has since come around.<br>
 <br>
I did not hear the whole incident with the &#8220;N&#8221; word. Anything I<br>
read is out of context. I don&rsquo;t have an opinion. I can see her<br>
point of being fed-up with blacks having privileges that whites<br>
don&rsquo;t have (because then we are labeled racist), and I can see<br>
the other side, that the &#8220;N&#8221; word is vulgar  &mdash;  just because some<br>
blacks use it, we should not stoop to their level. <br>
 <br>
I am saddened that she will be leaving radio; I hope she reconsiders. Even though I don&rsquo;t always agree with her, she has<br>
helped a lot of people.<br>
          <br>
Was it wrong for her to apologize? Again, I just don&rsquo;t know, but<br>
I&rsquo;m enjoying reading your opinions.</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s leaving? I didn&rsquo;t know she was still around. She struck me as some awful holier than thou fraud, dispensing platitudes for a living. Having had a dysfunctional relationship with her own mother, I feel she wasn&rsquo;t in a position to advise others on how to handle their lives. She was selling voyeurism on the pretext of giving advice. No great loss to the culture, she certainly was no ally of ours.</p>

		<p>This whole thing smells like a hoax to me.  It may be another way for the powers that be to intimidate ol&rsquo; Whitey, to keep him/her from speaking out, or standing up for White people.  Why, look at what happened to Dr. Laura.  She said da N-word on the radio, and now she is going down for it.  We gotta watch what we say/do.  We  can&rsquo;t speak out, especially about blacks.</p>
<p>Think about it.  How do you suppose this incident will affect those who may be inclined to stand up for themselves, especially if they are White?</p>

		<p>The matter that I find disturbing is that an educated person, like Dr. Schlessinger does not understand what is in the constitution in a matter that affects her so directly as freedom of communication. The first amendment puts restrictions on governments, not private entities (actually it only restricts the federal government). The FCC effectively does impose some control over broadcasting by its ability to revoke licenses, and impose fines. However it does not appear to have taken any action against the Laura Schlessinger program. So why is she blathering about her first amendment rights?  Either she is ignorant or she assumes her audience is. </p>

<p>Unless your mother would have similarly washed your mouth out for saying &#8220;hillbilly&#8221; or &#8220;redneck&#8221; then spare us the lectures. And spare us the idiocy of saying it&rsquo;s not the same. It is the same. It&rsquo;s just not the same to you.</p>
<p>Personally, it irritates me that anyone would be fired and dragged through the dirt for saying any of them. They&rsquo;re all rude and better left unsaid. But not any more than the &#8220;F&#8221; word.</p>

<p>Dr. Laura was discussing the use of a word that was brought up by the caller. In cases such as this, where you are talking about the word itself and how it is used, it is fine to actually use the word even in polite conversation in public, because it should be understood that it is not being used to insult.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a celebrity  &mdash;  an intelligent professional  &mdash;  who&rsquo;s finally willing to make a case for the First Amendment&rsquo;s application to speech deemed offensive to someone else&rsquo;s  sensibilities (you&rsquo;d almost imagine that melanin causes thin skin).</p>
<p>This simply isn&rsquo;t the same as yelling &#8220;fire!&#8221; in a crowded theater.  I don&rsquo;t mind being called a &#8220;cracker&#8221; or a &#8220;redneck&#8221; (though I do resent being the brunt of Dick Gregory&rsquo;s jokes at Tavis Smiley&rsquo;s State of the Black Union forum every yesr), and most blacks aren&rsquo;t offended at being called &#8220;n***er&#8221; by other blacks; all this feigned outrage is a matter of them &#8220;playing&#8221; us.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to lighten up a bit (or a lot), and quit trying to censor the dictionary.  What&rsquo;s next?  Burning Mark Twain books?  How about Dr. Albert Sweitzer&rsquo;s or David Livingstone&rsquo;s writings? </p>
<p>I think the term &#8220;African-American&#8221; is a tedious, awkward, and pathetic expression of a dignity that&rsquo;s rarely reciprocated toward us generic &#8220;whites.&#8221;  And I think Dr. Laura deserves our respect for taking a stand against PC totalitarianism.  You go, girl!   </p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they can say it and white people can&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>When will they ever learn? Once you have to clarify your statements you are a goner. People in holes have to learn to stop digging. The worst spectacle though is that of all of her so called peers dumping on her. Lou Dobbs, what a disaster, had on his radio show the other day another female, white, radio shrink who tried to out do Dobbs in attacking &#8220;Dr Laura&#8221; for her choice of word&rsquo;s, going so far as to say that this is an anti black racist country. Say what you will about them but you will rarely if ever see or hear black professionals act this way towards each other.</p>

		<p>I used to listen to Dr. Laura some years ago, admired her show but she was always jumping people for being against interracial marriage, using &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;bigot&rsquo; very freely.  Also, I noticed her mother died and lay dead in a room for a week before someone discovered her. Dr. Laura is also estranged from her sister. For someone who is always giving heavy advice on relationships, she seems to have trouble following it.</p>
<p>That being said, I think she used &#8216;N****r&rsquo; in a way to make a point, and she didn&rsquo;t need to apologize, nor announce she&rsquo;ll retire&hellip;unless she was ready to quit radio, anyway. That&rsquo;s always possible.  It&rsquo;s understood that the use of nigger is for blacks only, and they use it as a point to destroy any white that is perceived as being racist, although they do use the word ALL the time.  Yesterday I was in the gym jogging, and some blacks said n****r while they played, and a black woman also jogging shouted at them to not use the word. Blacks are torn&hellip;a part of them want to be &#8216;civilized&rsquo;, but the other part can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t. They also are unable to understand any use of irony.  Dr .Laura&rsquo;s use was like that of Lenny Bruce years ago when he included saying &#8216;n****r&rsquo; several times in a monologue. However, we live in repressive times, and in a multicultural state like ours that is openly dedicated to ending the white race, a dictatorship of thought is necessary to cow the (slowly shrinking) white majority.</p>
<p>As for me, once I got into an argument with a black and he screamed at me, calling me &#8216;n****r&rsquo; twice, like an animal out of control.  &#8216;I&rsquo;m a honky, not a n****r,&rsquo; I replied. </p>
<p>As Dr. Laura unintentionally demonstrated, to attack one of the pet minorities is to bring doom. Whites need their own country, and the rest can have America. It isn&rsquo;t ours anymore. Who&rsquo;s with me?</p>

		<p>Istvan, I agree: the word &#8220;n****r&#8221; is indeed a vulgar racial epithet, and I think many on this site would agree.  As a matter of taste and propriety it should not be used on the airwaves.  However, what we have going on here is much more than that.  What we have is an exercising of muscle by the politically correct, turning a vulgar epithet into something far worse  &mdash;  so bad that you will be censored on &#8220;conservative&#8221; Sean Hannity&rsquo;s radio show if you should use it in ANY context&hellip;or perhaps struck down by the wrath of God!  One cannot even say &#8220;the word &#8216;n***r&rsquo; is in the dictionary&#8221; without risk of ostracision.  The end goal is to maintain a racial reign of terror.  This &#8220;n-word&#8221; business is pusillanimous and mealy-mouthed.  Civilized adults know the proper and improper use of epithets, and what I believe Dr. Laura, as well as Michael Richards (Kramer of &#8220;Seinfeld&#8221;) were doing was voicing objection to the sacrosanct posing of those who would destroy individuals on the basis of this one word.  Not long ago a Washington, DC employee was fired (or nearly so) for using the word &#8220;n*****dly,&#8221; a word of Middle English derivation that has no relation whatsoever to the similar-sounding epithet.  It all amounts to an enforcement mechanism of the PC totalitarians and we need to treat it and them with the contempt and ridicule they deserve.</p>

Come on, Whitey keep on apologizing when you &#8220;offend&#8221; any black no matter how much they offend you!

<p>Yeah, no one is being fired for using the word &#8216;red-neck&rsquo; the nearest corollary to the &#8216;N&rsquo; word. In fact, the word &#8216;redneck&rsquo;, a racial slur, is normally used by the speaker in an effort to show everyone else how enlightened he is. Just the same, since the effort is about roping in whites, it would be wise to know those in charge, whether they are conscious of it or not, are on the looking for a chance to make an &#8216;example&rsquo; of any red-neck around. Adjust your vocabulary as if your job depends on it. Actually, everyone already seems to do that. It&rsquo;s not such a dumb precaution.</p>

		<p>We should remember that Dr. Laura is not a race realist and does not oppose interracial marriage. </p>
<p>Dr. Laura attempted to point out to this black caller that the N word is just a word, that blacks find it offensive when whites use it but use it among themselves freely. The problem is with the blacks themselves who have such a blatant double standard.</p>
<p>The fact is the N word controversy is solely about blacks attempting to obtain power over what whites can and cannot say. Blacks want to be able to use the N word freely but to attack and destroy any white who ever dares to use it. It is all part of the current system of racial double standards.</p>
<p>Frankly, I never thought Dr. Laura&rsquo;s advice was all that good. She would often let moral reprobates off the hook for misconduct while forgiving people for unforgivable acts, and sometimes she&rsquo;d attack people for nothing at all. I also don&rsquo;t care for Dr. Laura&rsquo;s rude, sarcastic and condescending tone when dealing with callers. To quote Mr. T &#8220;I pity the fool&#8221; who calls Dr. Laura. </p>
<p>Dr. Laura would no doubt attack me if I expressed my views on her show as a &#8220;racist&#8221;, simply because I would like for my culture to survive. I have no use for Dr. Laura and in my opinion she&rsquo;s getting what she deserves. </p>
<p>Even Anti-racists and political moderates will increasingly find that they too can incur the wrath of the thought police for uttering even minor statements that border on race realism or expose racial double standards. The race problem will only grow over time because over time minorities will obtain more and more power over what we can and cannot say. </p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>
<p><br>
Government, in this case, has nothing to do with it.  Government has not dictated anything. Government has not fired her. </p>
<p>As poster   said above, &#8220;The First Amendment puts restrictions only on government, not private entities?&#8221;    Her &#8220;First Amendment rights&#8221; only apply to what powers the GOVERNMENT has to control or punish speech. They do not apply to a private employer or corporation (such as a radio station)  who can make whatever rules it wants   &mdash;   if you want to work there, that is. You don&rsquo;t have to abide by their rules, of course, but you don&rsquo;t have to work there either. </p>
<p>If I hire a maid, and I make it clear that I do not allow curse words in my home, I am not interfering with her First Amendment Rights.  I am just upholding the rules in my house.  If she doesn&rsquo;t like my rules, she can go work somewhere else and curse all she wants, but not in my home. This has nothing to do with the Constitution or government.</p>

<p>They can have the N word. I am not jealous.  I do not envy them.  They can use all the other vulgar words too that they are so free with. I don&rsquo;t want any of them.  They can curse all they want.  Let them show the world how vulgar they are.  I don&rsquo;t need anyone to tell me I can&rsquo;t use it.  I have never used it anyway and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to.

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to hear the &ldquo;N&rdquo; word, or the &ldquo;F&rdquo; word or any of the other vulgarism&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine, but protecting YOU from speech that is unsettling is YOUR responsibility. It is not accomplished by a blanket restriction on everyone else, who would then essentially be doing the work for you. </p>
<p>Moderate what discourse you&rsquo;re exposed to by carefully selecting and controlling the public situations you participate in. Avoid certain TV shows and radio broadcasts. Yes, it&rsquo;s HARD work to tune out the flood of obscenity this country accepts in public interaction. </p>
<p>Fragile sensitivities and &#8220;delicate ears&#8221; are exactly what&rsquo;s led this country to become - as you so accurately described it - a third world America.</p>
<p>Whites are constantly doing the intellectual equivalent of curling into the fetal position and whimpering for someone else to do the hard part. We pout our lips out, stick our thumbs in our mouths, and stammer &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like it! Make it stop!&#8221;</p>
<p>You know what? Look the problem in the eye, stand your ground, and confront the matter head-on. YOU do the work. It may lead to bruised egos and broken furniture, but whites need to stop being a race of snot-nosed crybabies.</p>
<p>A lack of morality and common decency is not a cause for endorsing the &#8220;filtering&#8221; of public speech. If you hear it and it bothers you, stay off the soap box and address the speaker directly. </p>
<p>Your aversion to &#8220;vulgarity,&#8221; though understandable within the context you&rsquo;ve described, is exactly the &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; that could one day land organizations like American Renaissance on the &#8220;prohibited list.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happens if a majority of &#8220;enlightened&#8221; Americans decides race-based discussion is vulgar and therefore forbidden?</p>

		<p>Whether hypocritical or not (and I tend to think she is) Dr. Laura IS an anti-feminist, believing, as I do, that the feminist movement has done much to destroy the traditional White American family, which is the glue that holds together White civilization. </p>
<p>I well remember the messages of feminist radicals, their hateful doctrine ingrained in the curriculum and media during the 70s and 80s  &mdash;  a family is anything we say it is!  Children don&rsquo;t need fathers and grow up just fine without them!  A woman&rsquo;s place is in the boardroom not the bedroom!  If a woman insists on having children (which interferes with her self-fulfillment) instead of an abortion, they should be placed in day care immediately all day!  Who needs marriage or men?  They are stifling!  Marriage is just a meaningless piece of paper!  If you want a relationship with a man, live together, that leaves you free to leave at anytime to pursue your own interests!</p>
<p>Traditional marriage, men and motherhood were mocked, scorned and impugned.  I cannot think of a worse message to relate to young females than this one and I believe now it is a part of the larger War on Whites and Traditional White American culture executed by egalitarian marxists to reduce White numbers.</p>
<p>As a veteran teacher, I have seen the effects the destruction of the traditional family has had on children  &mdash;  the effects of divorce, now at 50+ percent, the effects on boys from fatherless families, the effects on children who spend or spent long hours in day care, the utter dysfunction of broken families, the rise of violent gangs that provide a &#8216;family structure&rsquo; to fatherless boys, the nihilistic attitude of high school students, illegitimacy rates of 30% in the White community, 75% in the black community.</p>
<p>Dr. Laura is a champion of  Traditional Marriage and Traditional Family, believing divorce and single parenting have wrought havoc on the well-being of children.  She advocates for stay-at-home mothers and home schooling as she feels the K-12 curriculum is poisonous to young minds and that children do best in stable, two parent households.</p>
<p>She promotes women treating men, especially in marriage, with kindness and respect, not as objects of ridicule or scorn (See:   &#8216;The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Because of her advocacy for children and having had first-hand experience with dysfunctional families, I changed my work location and hours so I could be at my son and daughter&rsquo;s school house door every day when their school day ended.  I have NEVER EVER seen my children happier than that first day, and have the image to this second in my head of my son bursting through the front doors of the school running as fast as he could across the lawn, with the biggest smile on his face, holding onto his lunchbox and backpack, seeing me and knowing that he never again had to go to a day care center.  </p>
<p>I have Dr. Laura to thank for helping to free me from the evils of feminism and decades-long  brainwashing I received.</p>

<p>I am not black, but I like black people because they&rsquo;re different and offer unique views.  But race hustling won&rsquo;t stop until whites ignore it, the media stops benefiting from it, or until every black goes back to Africa.  Not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Should Americans regret slavery?  Yes.  Do blacks prompted by media race huslters want the country to melt down in a race war?  I don&rsquo;t think so, but I say it already is a race war, only fake one.  Blacks want what everybody wants, power.  It is for this reason, that for five thousand years, race segragation brought peace.  Music, Art, Literature, and culture show that the races are distincly different, but equally human.  It is greed, globalism, and the new world order that will bring in the utopian night mare aparently on the horizen until people can understand that there are no equals outside of the grave.</p>

		<p>OCCAM, spot on with your comment. <br>
You are EXACTLY right about the origin of the word.<br>
Frankly, I don&rsquo;t use it casually myself, but there have been a handful of times in my life when I felt the need to use the word in a hostile situation, and was ready and willing to move beyond mere words.<br>
Having said that, if I had a mere penny for everytime I THOUGHT the word when I encounter N-type behavior, I would be a very rich man indeed!<br>
Talk about reparations: the NAACP should be paying me for having to put up with such jungle/ghetto behavior in our otherwise civil society.</p>
