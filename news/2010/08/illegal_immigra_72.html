	<p>One in 12 babies born in the U.S. in 2008 were offspring of illegal immigrants, according to a new study, an estimate that could inflame the debate over birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants make up slightly more than 4% of the U.S. adult population. However, their babies represented twice that share, or 8%, of all births on U.S. soil in 2008, according to the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report, based on Pew&rsquo;s analysis of the Census Bureau&rsquo;s March 2009 Current Population Survey, also found that the lion&rsquo;s share, or 79%, of the 5.1 million children of illegal immigrants residing in the U.S. in 2009 were born in the country and are therefore citizens.</p>
<p>In total, about 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the U.S. Latinos account for 75% of undocumented U.S. immigrants and about 85% of the births among that population.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a national group that lobbies for curbing immigration, said Wednesday its studies have yielded numbers similar to those estimated by Pew.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Proponents of amending the 14th Amendment, which was enacted in 1868, say it was intended to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves after the Civil War, not the offspring of illegal immigrants. Their proposals are expected to appeal to conservative Republican voters as immigration emerges as a central issue in November&rsquo;s elections.</p>
<p>GOP opponents of repealing birthright citizenship say it undermines the party&rsquo;s electoral prospects among Hispanics, the nation&rsquo;s largest minority and fastest-growing group. Generally, Democrats are strongly opposed to repeal.</p>
<p>Mr. Passel said that the Pew analysis found that more than 80% of the undocumented immigrant mothers who gave birth in the U.S. had been in the country at least a year, and that many had been here about a decade.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Jeffrey S. Passel and Paul Taylor, Pew Hispanic Center, August 11, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>An estimated 340,000 of the 4.3 million babies born in the United States in 2008 were the offspring of unauthorized immigrants, according to a new analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>Unauthorized immigrants comprise slightly more than 4% of the adult population of the U.S., but because they are relatively young and have high birthrates, their children make up a much larger share of both the newborn population (8%) and the child population (7% of those younger than age 18) in this country.</p>
<p>These figures are based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s March 2009 Current Population Survey, augmented with the Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo;s analysis of the demographic characteristics of the unauthorized immigrant population using a &#8220;residual estimation methodology&#8221; it has employed for the past five years. (For a description, see Appendix B in the full report.)</p>
<p>The new Pew Hispanic analysis finds that nearly four-in-five (79%) of the 5.1 million children (younger than age 18) of unauthorized immigrants were born in this country and therefore are U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>In total, 4 million U.S.-born children of unauthorized immigrant parents resided in this country in 2009, alongside 1.1 million foreign-born children of unauthorized immigrant parents.</p>

		<p>When did we first begin to read and hear about the dire forecast of &#8220;latinos&#8221; becoming the majority in this nation by something like 2050? </p>
<p>I recall first reading this in the MSM about 25 years ago, when the libs were claiming that Ronald Reagan wanted to blow up the world, when in reality he wanted to destroy global communism, which he did. </p>
<p>I was a bit alarmed then. But I questioned the claim: how can anyone tell what will happen in 75 years? Too many unpredictable variables are involved. Yet I sensed then what I know now: the left has for decades wanted a non-White majority whom they could play like puppets. </p>
<p>If 340,000 non-Americans (which is legally what they are) were born in this nation last year, and the left has been &#8220;foretelling&#8221; a non-White majority since at least 25 years ago, doing the math is a sobering and formidable task. </p>
<p>The left got their wish &hellip; I mean &hellip; the left made a fairly accurate prediction. </p>
<p>However, they failed to tell us decades ago that in their predictions they were including the tens of millions of illegal breeding invaders who would comprise this majority. And how could we have known that leftist liars would wield the ellipses (&hellip;) on the 14th Amendment of our Beloved Constitution and employ a childishly dishonest interpretaion of that Document to wipe out the White Americans who wrote the blessed thing. </p>
<p>God help us! </p>

		<p>Roughly ten percent of public school enrollment is a direct result of illegal immigration. Six percent of enrollment is due to births to parents of illegal aliens.</p>

https://tinyurl.com/4y2gls </p>
<p>Note: Estimates of public school enrollment due to illegal immigration: pp. 7-8 (2 million illegal immigrant children plus 3 million children born to illegal immigrants = 5 million children, or about 10 percent of total enrollment of 53 million).</p>
<p>Estimates for the costs of educating students who do not speak English fluently: 20 to 40 percent higher than the average student (p. 2 of CBO study); </p>

		<p>And the insanity of illegal births just keeps perpetuating itself, aided and abetted by obtuse white liberals for what purpose. What nation on the face of this planet would actively work towards its own demise except our own? Parts of Europe aren&rsquo;t far behind, but we&rsquo;re leading the pack. For the record, Jacob Howard, the author of the 14th amendment is on the record regarding its meaning:</p>
<p>This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the family of ambassadors, or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>How could anything be more clear? What could possibly be misinterpreted from that statement? It will NOT include foreigners. NOT, NOT, NOT. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll retire to Bedlam. </p>

		<p>There is talk now about how Middle Easterners are coming here to give birth to Anchor Babies, so in 20 or 25 years they can as citizens have all the freedom to stay here and commit terrorist acts against us.Did you hear it?It might be a blessing in disguise, and help us to stop the insane abuse of the 14th amendment.</p>

<p>And what percentage of immigrants flatly refuse to send their children to school?  This stat might vastly underpredict the population because it relies on a value we have that they do not share&hellip;&hellip;a value of education.</p>

		<p>Three solutions. </p>
<p> Enforce current restrictions on welfare and medicaid applied to illegals. </p>
<p>Make E-verify national, uniform, and enforced on every employer who files a tax return. For those who don&rsquo;t and use illegals in landscaping, construction, etc., maximum tax fraud and evasion penalties. </p>
<p>Eliminate student visas for foreigners, cut off all fed aid to colleges that harbor illegals and overstayers, and ban H-1 so called skilled workers who never leave. Americans may have to do without their Indian doctor or wait for an American to be trained to fill a high tech position, but we either want an American/European heritage nation or we don&rsquo;t. (Many whites don&rsquo;t give a damn). Try to describe your problems to an Indian or Chinese born doctor. They are so &#8220;caring&#8221; and can&rsquo;t speak English in any intelligible accent that resembles the clarity of even the least educated white in America). We don&rsquo;t &#8220;need&#8221; anyone who is not part and parcel of the culture that did just fine until King, hapless LBJ and the Kennedys began to bestow the virtues of diversity upon us.</p>

		<p>That means that if 51% of newborns are White then the actual percentage is 59% excluding illegals.  I wouldn&rsquo;t do cartwheels over this fact but it&rsquo;s better than originally thought.  I wonder if it occurs to the average stupid White voter that these children are being born on their dime and as an added bonus be able to vote in 18 years.  Not only vote but out vote them and give states with heavy illegal populations extra electoral votes to skew any Presidential election.  </p>

		<p>Revising the 14th Amend. is the way to go, but there is almost no chance of getting 2/3 of congress to go along, even after the Republicians gain some seats this November.  There is possibly a way to get the job done through a bil in congress.  But that is unlikely also.  Until we get the traitors out of congress we are stuck.</p>
