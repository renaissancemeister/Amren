<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=191941">Ending &#8216;Discrimination&rsquo; Results in Totalitarianism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Grey, WorldNetDaily, August 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its most basic form, discrimination is simply freedom of choice by an individual or group. Any expression of preference for one person or thing over another is a form of discrimination. The only way completely to eliminate discrimination would be to take away the rights of people to make choices.</p>
<p>This obviously is not consistent with living in a free society. Politicians and the courts have tried to dance around this conflict between freedom and anti-discrimination by making choices for people about which forms of discriminate are allowed and which are not allowed, but the list of choices (or discrimination) that is not allowed keeps getting longer.</p>
<p>That list of government-prohibited forms of discrimination now includes race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, disability, and in some cases even weight. {snip}</p>
<p>However, there are many situations in which even these prohibited forms of discrimination may be entirely appropriate. Is it really a good idea for a jockey to be fat? Or for a lifeguard to be 80 years old? Or for a firefighter to be a paraplegic? {snip}</p>
<p>These may be extreme examples, but the point is that in a free society, no matter what the government tries to do, people still need to make choices about what they believe is right and wrong. Trying to take those rights away from people leads the government to be more and more involved and ultimately in control of private life. This is the definition of totalitarianism.</p>
<p>In practice, what really happens is that the government instead of people starts to make decisions about which forms of discrimination are allowed and which are not allowed. Discrimination still is happening, but now the government is in control of it rather than individuals.</p>
<p>A classic example of how this works is affirmative action. {snip}</p>
<p>Basically, the government has decided that it&rsquo;s appropriate and even necessary to discriminate against certain people to make up for past discrimination against other people. Although this possibly could make logical sense for a period of time, it&rsquo;s equally logical that if it goes on forever the group that supposedly was victimized by discrimination in the past almost certainly would end up eventually in a superior position. How long that reversal of fortune would take to happen cannot be determined, but affirmative action typically does not have an expiration date on it. This basically guarantees that at some point the group receiving preference actually will be the advantaged group and the group being discriminated against actually will be the disadvantaged group. This would basically amount to discrimination on top of discrimination or kicking people when they&rsquo;re already down.</p>
<p>Arguably, this reversal of fortune already has happened at most top universities. Specifically, the most underrepresented group in most top universities in this country is white conservative Christians. This group represents nearly 50 percent of the U.S. population, but at most top universities less than 20 percent of the students (and less than 10 percent of faculty and staff) identify themselves in this category. This is an extreme disparity that if it applied to any other group would be cause for government- or at least school-mandated affirmative action. Similarly, Asians and Jews are extremely overrepresented in most top universities. This is because they tend to have much better qualifications than other applicants.</p>
<p>However, the groups receiving preferential admission are still African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and to some extent those with disabilities, gays and lesbians, and athletes. None of these groups receiving preferential admissions is nearly as underrepresented (and some actually are overrepresented) at these top universities as white conservative Christians, yet they continue to receive preference. What is the explanation for that except the obvious political bias of the universities?</p>
<p>As a concept, affirmative action often is applied very selectively and arbitrarily, but this is how government and totalitarianism usually operates. Governments make decisions based on politics, not fairness. Affirmative action has been applied aggressively to university admissions and staffing, public sector jobs, government contractors and programs, finance and lending, and graduate schools. It has not been applied at all to areas such as professional sports and entertainment. Why not? The superficial explanation is that there is not a political objective in applying affirmative action equally across different sectors of the economy. At a deeper level, it&rsquo;s equally apparent that the overriding objective of affirmative action is to disadvantage whites and males and to advantage minorities and women. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other forms of affirmative action, such as for African Americans, may have more of a rational economic basis. Nevertheless, the reason for it is still the same. Politicians want to buy votes and this is an easy way to do it. The people who benefit from the preferential treatment or feel that they might benefit from it are much more motivated to support the politicians who favor it than the people who are disadvantaged by affirmative action. It&rsquo;s a good political calculation.</p>

<p>Wrong; it is a very bad political calculation, Mr. Grey!</p>
<p>It is not only shortsighted and stupid, it is also the hallmark of a death wish that the elites in both dominant political parties seem to dance and prance after, like whores toward an indifferently protective pimp. There will be no protection, so long as money and power are accumulated at their questionably &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; usefulness to that pimp, in other words.</p>
<p>The socioeconomic system of this country, and the West in general, allows for white sociopolitical elites because there is an assumed &ldquo;common interest.&rdquo; These &ldquo;common interests,&rdquo; are based upon a physically strong and emotionally invested white middleclass believing in the elites&rsquo; ability to willingly and forcefully protect their interests. Once that erodes, which is exactly what multiculturalisms&rsquo; point and purpose is for existing, the system begins to collapse. There are no amount of laws that can be passed, to realistically replace the white middleclass with Third World entitlement zombies and maintain socioeconomic stability; there are no amount of laws that can be passed, to realistically reduce &ldquo;white privileges&rdquo; and the resulting sociopolitical order it fosters, and expect a Western society to not devolve into Mexico or Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The worthless and gutless fools above us don&rsquo;t realize this, in their collective diversity stupor now. However, they eventually will.</p>
<p>But by then, who will care about them?</p>
<p>After all, the most destructive class with &ldquo;white privileges&rdquo; today, will only have their tolerance hangovers and no allies at all to offer them even the most basic analgesic comforts: </p>

		<p>The reason that we, as a society, are vulnerable at all to this totalitarianism is because we refuse to admit that discrimination is a good thing&hellip;..or at least utilitarian in nature.</p>
<p>The absolute bottom line.  You can&rsquo;t live with blacks unless there are a group of two or three armed police on every corner.  Since, most places can&rsquo;t afford that, most people live segregated and hypocritically give lip service to living together.</p>
<p>The trouble starts when one group decides to force another to do as they say and not as they do.  That&rsquo;s basically what has been going on in the US for the last 40 to 50 years&hellip;..and it&rsquo;s hurt alot of people.</p>
<p>But people are waking up.  Specifically, they are waking up to the fact that they have a strong grievance against those forcing them to live as they themselves never would&hellip;&hellip;.and that those people have neither a mechanism of enforcement nor one for self defense (after all, those who live in THEIR neighborhoods rarely cause trouble of any kind).</p>
<p>It should be interesting how this plays out&hellip;.especially since the primary antagonist (the federal government) is bankrupt.  Not only bankrupt but nobody has even an ounce of faith (or even respect for) in them anymore.  It&rsquo;s a little late to be hiring jack booted thugs.  And no one is willing to take on the role because they believe in the cause, so to speak.</p>
<p>As I said, it should be interesting how this plays out.</p>

<p>Now, that sentence is clearly a Grand Slam Home Run, with all bases loaded!   While the writer didn&rsquo;t mention The Frankfurt School of Cultural Marxism directly, it is the foundation for everything that has happened in our nation and in Western civilization since the early 1960s, and which can be summed up in this simple fashion:  An ideological, cultural, and yes, racial war - has been declared and waged upon primarily White males and the ultimate objective of this war is to destroy the White race, since only white men can father white babies with white females. </p>
<p>The Cultural Marxists certainly have studied their targeted victims well, and have decided that if they can disenfranchise white males from as many areas of our society&rsquo;s infrastructure as possible - from academia, from media, from employment, from political influence, from government, etc., this will effectively deny white men the opportunity to use their natural talents, abilities and work ethic to seek and obtain well paying positions of employment that provide them with attractive qualities to offer a white female in a marriage-husband-father and provider role.  For those white men who are already married, putting up as many roadblocks and discriminatory hurdles as possible in front of him - retards his ability to advance, as the lesser qualified minorities are boosted over him on the ladder of promotion and hiring.  Since the goal of Cultural Marxism is to destroy Western Civilization, and since the White male is the architect of that civilization, he is in the cross-hairs.</p>
<p>An example in my own personal life - I once worked for a US Navy Captain who was apparently a Naval Academy Graduate.   Early into his tour of duty at the government agency where I worked - he scheduled a series of meetings, in order to meet and greet the roster of people he had on the payroll.  This fellow had a slide show and when he got to his slide on &#8216;Diversity&rsquo;, for the first time during the otherwise boring discussion - his eyes seemed to light up, and he began to salivate and excitedly assure us how much he loved diversity and how important diversity was going to be during his reign of authority. He then began to tell us how &#8216;concerned&rsquo; he was, when he roamed the hallways of his organization, because he saw &#8216;far too many faces of White males&rsquo;, and he saw that as a serious &#8216;problem&rsquo; that he intended to try to &#8216;fix&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Now, I would like to ask the AR community a question.   Had that bigoted, anti-white, Cultural Marxist trained U.S. Navy Captain substituted any other race in the place of White males, and had<br>
he told an audience of his organization that he was &#8216;concerned&rsquo; because he saw far too many black or Asian or Hispanic any other ethnic group&rsquo;s faces when he roamed the halls of his organization - how long do you think that fellow would have remained the leader of that organization?    How long do you think he would have remained in the Navy?    Not long, is my<br>
best guess.   But, you see - the Cultural Marxism ideology is waging an openly declared war on White males in America - and this guy obviously knew who he could express bigotry towards without being fired.  </p>
<p>Recently, we all may have seen the announcement by the U.S. Navy that they are planning on establishing a special team to &#8216;coach&rsquo; and &#8216;groom&rsquo; and pour copious amounts of fertilizer on minorities, in order to boost them up the ladder into the officer and leadership ranks in the Navy - and no white males need apply.  So, the bigotry that I personally saw from one U.S. Navy Captain is about to go Navy-wide.<br>
 <br>
This needs to change.    Immediately.   And, these Cultural Marxist subversive enemies need to be identified, rooted out, exposed, and then cut out of our society - because they are a cancer tumor and their intended goal is to destroy White Western Civilization.    </p>

		<p>#2:  you are 100% correct.  Strom Thurmond&rsquo;s main argument was that the Civil Rights bill would create socialism and would tell people who they had to associate with.  Here&rsquo;s a question: if it&rsquo;s unlawful to not hire someone or rent to someone because they are black, what if, let&rsquo;s say, I don&rsquo;t want a black boss or a black landlord?  How come nobody will sue me for that?</p>

<p>Maybe the answer lies in math. A system that oppressed 600,000 blacks for one year results in 600,000 people-years of oppression. The antidote (actually revenge, but let&rsquo;s not get into that) should be a system that oppresses 200,000,000 Whites for (600,000 / 200,000,000 = 0.003) times as long, or 26 hours and 17 minutes.</p>

		<p>Re [from the original article]: &#8220;&hellip;discrimination always will be with us. It&rsquo;s part of the human condition, and a necessary part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is correct. Here is a more every-day example of why: I over-heard one of our secretaries complain about discrimination, and I asked her if she DID NOT want me to discriminate between her excellent work performance and some other secretary&rsquo;s poor performance. &#8220;Well, no.&#8221; she sheepishly said.</p>
<p>The word has gotten a bad rap ever since it was shortened from &#8220;racial discrimination&#8221; to just &#8220;discrimination&#8221;. In the &rsquo;50s, there was a TV commercial that advertised &#8220;the cigarette for the discriminating smoker.&#8221; Needless to say, an ad touting discrimination, the ability to observe a difference, as a desirable trait could not be used today.</p>
