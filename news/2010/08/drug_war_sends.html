<h1>Drug War Sends Bullets Whizzing Across the Border</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alicia A. Caldwell, Yahoo! News, August 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first bullets struck El Paso&rsquo;s city hall at the end of a work day. The next ones hit a university building and closed a major highway. Shootouts in the drug war along the U.S.-Mexico border are sending bullets whizzing across the Rio Grande into one of the nation&rsquo;s safest cities, where authorities worry it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone gets hurt or killed.</p>
<p>At least eight bullets have been fired into El Paso in the last few weeks from the rising violence in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, one of the world&rsquo;s most dangerous places. And all American police can do is shrug because they cannot legally intervene in a war in another country. The best they can do is warn people to stay inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s really not a lot you can do right now,&#8221; El Paso County Sheriff Richard Wiles said. &#8220;Those gun battles are breaking out everywhere, and some are breaking out right along the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police say the rounds were not intentionally fired into the U.S. But wildly aimed gunfire has become common in Juarez, a sprawling city of shanty neighborhoods that once boomed with manufacturing plants. It&rsquo;s ground zero in Mexico&rsquo;s relentless drug war.</p>
<p>More than 6,000 people have been killed there since 2008, when the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels started battling each other and Mexican authorities for control of the city and smuggling routes into the U.S. Nationwide, more than 28,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon launched his offensive against the cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006.</p>

		<p>All the US has to do is end the insane drug war, then the Mexican drug lords would be out of business. Those who favor the drug war profit from it, either the police, the courts, the prisons, or being a drug dealer. Both sides depend on laws making drugs illegal to thrive.</p>

<p>T&rsquo;was a time when cross border raiding or shots from banditos out of Mexico brought the U.S. Cavalry down south to find and hang some examples.</p>
<p>Now we can do it without people at risk using an MQ-5 Hunter<br>

<p>Which don&rsquo;t have the same high visibility profile as the MQ-1 Predator as they are little bigger than sport radio control airplanes and can be launched from any straight stretch of road, inconspicuously.</p>
<p>Messr. Calderone needs to be told that before he makes another bold announcement in Europe about the United States being his bitch, he&rsquo;d better have his house in order or we will come down there and severely embarrass the Mexican Macho Muchacho pride he operates under by planting a few corpses ourselves.</p>
<p>Let it also be added that if this place is a hole without jobs, then there is nothing to be lost in forceibly deporting the shanty dwellers and leaving ONLY the drug dealers and the cops in play.</p>
<p>Nothing except free sheep-from-goat herd cover for those civilians who are about to try to run&rsquo;fer&rsquo;d&rsquo;border! that is.</p>
<p>If we had any testicular fortitude at all we would be so seriously making this OUR fight.</p>
<p>And the Republicans in particular couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better platform to begin the &#8220;See, they can&rsquo;t even keep the druggies at bay&hellip;&#8221; anti-democrat legislation with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also find and interview a few ex-mil types who don&rsquo;t have to worry about losing their careers as they describe what isn&rsquo;t being done vs. what could be, at-cost.</p>

		<p>The Anschluss of America by Mexico continues apace.  what a sad and pathetic nation we are, with troops in every corner of the world except the corner that is truly being overrun.  Our troops die (7 today) in Afghanistan to make us safe, but safe from what?  Muslims that we could easily exclude from our borders if we had the will.  Muslims who never should have never been let in and even now pose little real threat.  But the real fifth column marches across our borders bringing their lawless, backward culture with them.  We are truly a sad nation.  At least the Germans and Japanese went down fighting.  We just gave up.<br>

		<p>Like I said on another post watch the documentary &#8220;Gangland&#8221; on Spike TV. The MS-13 and their coming to the USA from El Salvador by the tens of thousands after the Iran/Contra affair&hellip;Why do we sit and allow these &#8220;refugees&#8221; from all our wars, conflicts etc. into our nation? We and THEY know what we will get! They are the most savage of them all. Yet our government will never close the border or deport these thugs and when they do deport some after they commit certain crimes, they come waltzing right back in&hellip;</p>

		<p>Sounds to me like we need to invade and establish a 20 mile buffer zone between us and the Mexicans.  Level everything inside the buffer zone, build two razor wire fences, mine the middle ground, and authorize deadly force for those intruding into the no man&rsquo;s land.  What&rsquo;s the Mex govt gonna do?  God to war with us?  What a joke.<br>
If they DO, we&rsquo;d win, but it would sure give us an excuse to round up all illegals, term them enemy combatants or spies, and either put them in POW camps or hang them.<br>
It IS going to come to that, eventually.  Way things are going.  The stinking Mex illegals and gangs have killed many times more Americans on our soil in the last ten years than the Taliban and Al Queda have.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Nationwide, more than 28,000 people have been killed since&hellip;December 2006&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 28,000 killed in a drug war.  That is a stunning statistic.  What is the solution?  We have a huge market for illicit drugs here in the US, thanks in large part to our rapidly expanding underclass (courtesy of our social and immigration policies since the 1960s).  </p>
<p>Contrary to what many liberals believe, I don&rsquo;t think relaxing our drug laws will solve the problem.  Since a nation obviously can&rsquo;t legalize cocaine and other heavy drugs, I don&rsquo;t see the US as being capable of significantly reducing the demand side of the equation, short of full militarization of the border.<br>

		<p>Legalize the drugs and put the governments in control&hellip;take the profit away from criminals and gangsters.  </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t win a drug war, we couldn&rsquo;t win prohibition, we can&rsquo;t win a drug war.  Jail, you can get any drug you want in jail, the number one place you would assume contraband would be just that, contra.  It&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>Legalize and despense all drugs to all addicts, and hope the OD.  They are dregs anyhow, just move them aside and stop the madness of drug lords, guns violence, and robberies.</p>
<p>The productive members of society would be exalted, the dregs would be shown for what they are, impediments to civilization.  Druggies ruin families, cities, and countries.  Not to mention the bankers making profits from money laundering and such.</p>
<p>Legalize now.  </p>

<p>I too am disturbed by this racial-revenge movie  &mdash;  with Whites receiving their &#8216;just due&rsquo; at the hands of  aggrieved hispanics:</p>
<p>&rsquo;Machete&rsquo; appears to be a Catholic hit man who was double crossed by white racists and so goes on a racial-religious, vengeance-driven killing spree against Whites, and becomes a kind of legendary Zorro-Jesus figure.</p>
<p>Alex Jones (love him or hate him) reports that &#8220;this film is a rallying cry for race war in America. Later, he claimed that two anonymous Hispanic crew members alerted him to the extent of the anti-White scenes in the film. &#8216;Further, two individuals who were privy to early screenings of Machete have warned that the film is far more racially inflammatory than either the trailer or leaked script have indicated.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor MacDonald writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The idea that Western culture and White people are uniquely evil have been common among the intellectual activists of the left that now dominate in the academic world, beginning with the Boasian anthropologists who dominated anthropology for most of the 20th century. The Boasians created an imaginary past expunged of ethnic violence and warfare. Non-Whites were portrayed as gift-givers and myth-makers, not at all prone to ethnic warfare&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, just like the movie Avatar.</p>
<p>And this from Istavan:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Anschluß of America by Mexico continues apace&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Only because the government allows it, as part of its War on Whites and White America.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;What a sad and pathetic nation we are, with troops in every corner of the world except the corner that is truly being overrun&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.  And it is also sad and pathetic that so few White Americans realize what is happening to us, having drunk the Kool-aid of the government/media/academia complex that dictate to us that handing over our homeland and wealth to non-Whites and destroying our own culture are in our best interests  &mdash;  that sacrificing our precious children into a hopeless, useless, Middle Eastern, Fourth World meat grinder while our borders remain wide open to violent predators, pedophiles and drug gangs is to &#8216;preserve and guarantee&rsquo; our own safety in America because if we &#8216;don&rsquo;t fight them there, we will fight them here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Who should we be fighting? Who are the true enemies of White Americans, those who work to strip us of the fruits of our labor, flood our country with hostile non-Whites and welfare dependents, have their boots on our White necks like Nazi overlords, make sure we&rsquo;re individualized and atomized while encouraging non-Whites to maintain their language and culture and promote hatred and historical grievances against Native-Born, White Americans?  </p>
<p>Know your enemy.  </p>
<p>And then Spread The Word and Tell Everyone You Know and Care About.</p>

		<p>Charles Marlow (#7) said: <i>Contrary to what many liberals believe, I don&rsquo;t think relaxing our drug laws will solve the problem. Since a nation obviously can&rsquo;t legalize cocaine and other heavy drugs, &hellip; </i></p>
<p>FYI, cocaine and heroin (among other now-outlawed drugs) were perfectly legal 100 years ago. A trace amount of cocaine was in the original formula for a certain soft drink. Ever hear of &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8221;?</p>
<p>This idiotic &#8220;war on (some) drugs&#8221; is Prohibition on steroids (no pun intended). That era was by far the most violent in our history. When the 18th Amendment was repealed in 1933, the violence instantly stopped because the black market for liquor instantly disappeared. Cogitator (#1) is 100% correct about the &#8220;judicial-industrial complex&#8221; that profits from the drug war even more than the gangs do. Ending the war will end the violence <i>and</i> end the militarization of law enforcement that has trashed so much of the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are signs the people are waking up to this scam. Several states have either legalized medical marijuana in defiance of the feds, or are considering it. Three hundred cheers for states&rsquo; rights!</p>
<p>This article hits close to home as I was born &amp; raised in El Paso. It used to be a nice place to live. And to anonymous #3,  several buildings there still sport bullet holes from the 1910 Mexican revolution, just as places in and around Pearl Harbor still show pockmarks from the 1941 attack.</p>
