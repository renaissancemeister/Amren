<h1>School&rsquo;s Race Rule Prompts Mom to Pull Kids Out</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Holbrook Mohr, Google News, August 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A policy intended to achieve racial equality at a north Mississippi school has long meant that only white kids can run for some class offices one year, black kids the next. But Brandy Springer, a mother of four mixed race children, was stunned when she moved to the area from Florida and learned her 12-year-old daughter couldn&rsquo;t run for class reporter because she wasn&rsquo;t the right race.</p>
<p>The rules sparked an outcry on blogs and other websites after Springer contacted an advocacy group for mixed-race families. The NAACP called for a Justice Department investigation  &mdash;  not surprising in a state with a history of racial tension dating to the Jim Crow era.</p>
<p>By Friday afternoon, the Nettleton School District announced on its website that it would no longer use race in school elections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Springer, who moved to Lee County from Florida in April, said her daughter was told the office of sixth-grade class reporter at Nettleton Middle School was available only to black students this year.</p>
<p>Her anger grew when she saw school election guidelines that allowed only whites to run for class president this year. In alternating years, the positions would be reversed so blacks could run for president and whites could hold other positions, district officials said.</p>
<p>Even if the rule is an attempt to ensure black and white participation, Springer said diversity is no longer a black and white issue, with a growing number of mixed-race children, Hispanics and other ethnicities attending school together.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Springer is white. Her two older children, including the sixth grader, are half Native American. Her two younger children have a black father.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The changes in school elections may have come too late for Springer. Springer said she moved to another school district last week and pulled her kids from Nettleton Middle School.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nettleton is a town of about 2,000 people with a population that is about 66 percent white and 32 percent black.</p>
<p>Springer&rsquo;s plight demonstrates the complexities faced not only by interracial families, but by school officials trying to achieve racial equality in a state known for tensions between blacks and whites. The school district also manipulated prom and homecoming elections so that the outcome is an equal division of blacks and whites.</p>
<p>Springer and others worried that could leave out Hispanics, Asians or any other student from another race or ethnicity, Springer said.</p>

<p>How laughable, the chickens are certainly coming home to roost here for multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Even for this wretched harlot and feckless race-traitor, Brandy Springer, &ldquo;social progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;racial tolerance&rdquo; have begun to become simply new areas of escalating conflict rather than rainbow harmony; that is all they will ever or can be, end of story. </p>
<p>If every white in this country were to marry outside of our race and willingly exterminate themselves in a generation, these problems will remain. The white-hybrid: Asians, Hispanics, and blacks would now be fighting for dominance with their non-mixed rivals or worse. </p>
<p>What else can be expected?</p>

		<p>Unlike many public schools in the south, the demographics of the student body are essentially identical to those of the town:  <a href="http://www.greatschools.org/mississippi/nettleton/669-Nettleton-High-School/" rel="nofollow">GreatSchools.Org demographic profile</a></p>
<p>Given a white majority and the presumption of racial voting, I think its reasonable to infer that the alternate-year practice was to elect black students who otherwise would have lost.</p>
<p>The policy was probably a relic anyway if the purpose was to elect blacks. Young white people seem more than willing to elect a charismatic black to class president or homecoming queen. </p>

		<p>One way or another, it will get worse for them and for us.  Either anti-miscegenation instincts will hold true and these hybrids will find no home among -any- of their home races.</p>
<p>Forcing them to choose among an ever narrowing neck of other peopleless souls which, IMO, is the real reason for racial solidarity the world over, in the face of deluge invasion as rape or forced integration.</p>
<p>Or the mix of colors will become so extreme (and the outbreeding depression so severe) that being of one race will itself be seen as &#8216;selfish&rsquo; because we get the full compliment of both useful and deleterious genes which gave our people their uniqueness as survivors.</p>
<p>The one thing we must guard against is the impression that being white is being socially introverted vs. socially repressed as an excuse to continue the &#8216;all colors but one color&rsquo; ideal of further blending without acknowledgement of exactly what the genetic gifts each race is give truly are.</p>
<p>Hiding these specializations when we know Hap Map and other programs are studying long sequence DNA and finding what are most likely significant ability related differences in the &#8216;we&rsquo;re all human&rsquo; population is going to become it&rsquo;s own damning proof of the wrongness of this as a blindfold experiment in genetics.</p>

		<p>If I had to guess, this school&rsquo;s policy on alternating the races eligible for these school offices on a yearly basis grew out of a lawsuit heard in the Federal judiciary in the 1970s.  That decade was perhaps the worst when it came to the Federal courts forcing schools to do insane things for the purpose of forced deseg.</p>
<p>For example, in 1978, a Federal judge in Cleveland ordered a high school in Cleveland to have a quota for whites on the basketball team and blacks on the baseball team.</p>

		<p>&#8220;She was stunned and it &#8220;sparked an outcry&#8221;. &#8220;Springer said diversity is no longer a black and white issue&#8221;&hellip; &#8220;Springer is white. Her two older children, including the sixth grader, are half Native American. (Does she mean indian? Because real &#8220;Native American&rsquo;s are White.) Her two younger children have a black father.&#8221; (She sounds like a real proud mother). What a can of &#8220;confusion&#8221; opened for this &#8220;family&#8221;.<br>
&#8220;Springer&rsquo;s plight demonstrates the complexities faced not only by interracial families, but by school officials trying to achieve racial equality&#8221;&hellip; (equality is not going to happen, but they can &#8220;try&#8221; all they want.) (It&rsquo;s all about Springer here). &#8220;Springer and others worried&#8221;&hellip; With the name &#8220;Springer&#8221;, no wonder.</p>

<p>I have a hard time believing this (probably) white trash woman (based on two separate fathers/races for all of her mixed race kids) is really losing sleep at night over the rights of latinos and asians.  She was mad her daughter was excluded and by throwing in names of other groups she hoped to increase the odds of sympathy in her favor.</p>
<p>I do, however, find it puzzling that this school district had this policy.  If it was intended to alleviate race inequalities, by focusing so much on race, it defeated the purpose!</p>

<p>Nettleton is a town of about 2,000 people with a population that is about 66 percent white and 32 percent black.</p>
<p>Springer&rsquo;s plight demonstrates the complexities faced not only by interracial families, but by school officials trying to achieve racial equality in a state known for tensions between blacks and whites. <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Why are they even trying to create racial &#8220;equality&#8221; in the first place? There is no such thing. That was their first mistake. The small town is 66% WHITE and 32% black, making them 98% of the population. Since the White population is DOUBLE the black pop. then Whites should be running the show, period. But no, they had to give concessions to the the black demands so all will be &#8220;equal&#8221;..</p>
<p>Now here comes some stupid White mother with mixed race kids and throws a hissy fit wanting &#8220;equality&#8221;. (meaning that the WHITES will have to be the ones to cave in, as usual)&hellip;.then she moves out!  She and her type are the reason the White race will soon be extinct. </p>

		<p>So, this white woman has two kids by an American Indian.  She then has two more kids by a black father.  And she&rsquo;s offended because the kids are OUTCASTS that don&rsquo;t really belong in either world?????   WE are offended that she betrays her race with singular regularity, and dooms her kids to a life of never really belonging, because she has some selfish mental defect.   She likes to mate with darks - damn the consequences.<br>

		<p>Hello Amren. I read Amren on a daily basis but I rarely ever post. Anyway, I find this story to be a perfect illustration of the effects the government/school boards/etc trying to mandate equal outcomes of all the races. To add to that, the more &#8220;diverse&#8221; the USA becomes the more there will be lunatic like mandates passed. LOL!!!</p>
<p>On a side note, while I personally don&rsquo;t believe in inter-racial marriage for myself, I beleive in a free country where people have a right to marry whom they want. That being said, I notice of all the inter-racial pairings I have come across, the most dysfunctional are when the mother is white and the father is black. </p>
<p>In Australia here we have many white Anglo men that have Chinese wives. (Again, I am not advocating this, just illustrating a point with like minded people)The children from these relationships are generally well behaved, clean, intelligent, and well mannered. The fathers from these unions often coach the little league rugby team and lead other similar activities. This holds true for most white male non-white female parings that I see. </p>
<p>On the flipside, while very very few Auzzie girls have African babies, the few that do are in complete chaos. All appear to be single moms (without exception) and all mad at the world. (without exception) Not sure what my point was in saying all that. But this article was kind of a microcosm of what I witness with my own eyes in regards to such pairings. </p>

<p>EXACTLY! Mixed race kids do not have an identity. They &#8220;belong&#8221; to 2 different races. This is why they always identify with their darker side. The darker side has more advantages for them and they are more entitled to &#8220;things&#8221; than their White side ever will be. Easier also because the darker side can always SUE!</p>

Not just your eyes, James.  That&rsquo;s exactly what we see here too. It seems to be the pattern everywhere.  Those girls are mad at the world and their lives are in complete chaos.  I could add that they are often obese, frequently drug addicts, and probably mental cases. (What woman in her right mind would get into that situation?)  That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Springer is white. Her two older children, including the sixth grader, are half Native American. Her two younger children have a black father.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is a heifer, http://www.wtva.com/news/local/story/Nettleton-School-Board-takes-race-out-of-student/9zjvb5GGWk-S5n8qlqJwCA.cspx</p>
<p>and I suspect not exactly white either.</p>

Well put, Frank.  <br>
Additionally   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s a small thing, but worth mentoning   &mdash;   momma&rsquo;s name is &#8220;Brandy&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s hardly better than a black name&hellip; not much better, but not even a real name at all. That indicates that her own mother was probably an unwed, uneducated teenager, and didn&rsquo;t have much sense either. Like mother, like daughter.</p>
<p>I wonder what her own kids&rsquo; names are. Probably some winners!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I have to agree with poster #16.</p>
<p>White father + non-white mother usually means a stable, intact family (I say usually because there are always exceptions).  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why in the dating and marriage race, white men are always out-preferred by women of all races hands down.  (There was a study from one of those dating sites recently that confirmed this.)</p>
<p>However, I have rarely seen a white mother/non-white father turn out well, and I&rsquo;ve seen tons of such situations where I&rsquo;m at (though there are a few exceptions and some relationships work out despite the challenges).  </p>
<p>Where I work, there is a white women who had a fling with some dominican dude.  Guess what, he&rsquo;s gone and she&rsquo;s a single mom.   </p>

		<p>I have nothing against Amerinds, but when you&rsquo;re half one race and half another, you really have nowhere to belong.</p>
<p>This pretty much drives that point home.</p>

		<p>That being said, I notice of all the inter-racial pairings I have come across, the most dysfunctional are when the mother is white and the father is black. </p>
<p>Black women have noticed that when the father of their children is black,  they are also dysfunctional.</p>

<p>My goodness, so much diversity! <br>
Some Questions: Does this mother of four have any husband?  Where is he? Has she EVER been married?  Who supports her/them?  Do her four children have four different fathers?  Does she even know who they are/were?</p>

		<p>The ironic thing about this policy of only letting blacks run for class president one year and whites the next is that these kind of policies are always based on the idea that race isn&rsquo;t important.</p>
