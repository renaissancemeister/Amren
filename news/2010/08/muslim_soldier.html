<h1><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2010/08/muslim_soldier_refuses_deploym.html">Muslim Soldier Refuses Deployment</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Selwyn Duke, American Thinker, August 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Twenty-year-old Naser Abdo joined the U.S. Army more than a year ago. Now that it&rsquo;s time to be sent to Afghanistan, however, he&rsquo;s having second thoughts. He is refusing deployment, claiming conscientious-objector status.</p>
<p>Has Pfc. Abdo suddenly developed an aversion to all war? Hardly. Here are his reasons, as reported by WSMV Nashville:<blockquote>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he said he now believes Islamic standards would prohibit his service in the U.S. Army in any war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;According to documents provided to The Associated Press, Abdo cited Islamic scholars and verses from the Quran as reasons for his decision to ask for separation from the Army.</p>
<p> &#8220;I realized through further reflection that God did not give legitimacy to the war in Afghanistan, Iraq or any war the U.S. Army would conceivably participate in,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;This is not about proving a point; it&rsquo;s about maintaining true to my Islamic faith and maintaining true to the American values,&#8221; said Abdo.<br>
</blockquote>Now, I would have a bit of a problem with any soldier who, after enlisting in the military, using resources during the course of his training and collecting a salary, suddenly has pangs of conscience when it&rsquo;s time to do the job for which he voluntarily signed up. But, as Fort Campbell (where Abdo has been assigned) representatives have said, they &#8220;recognize that even in our all-volunteer force, a soldier&rsquo;s moral, ethical and religious beliefs are subject to change over time.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Since Muslims have been known to war against and kill one another, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that the problem is simply a matter of fighting other Muslims. Rather, it appears it&rsquo;s a matter of fighting Muslims on behalf of America, our little corner of Dar al-Harb. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Common sense dictates that Abdo should not be deployed to a war zone, as someone harboring his beliefs would be a danger to fellow soldiers, if only because he cannot be relied upon to execute his duties. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}<br>

		<p>The question everyone is forgetting is this:  Did Allah approve of Pfc. Abdo taking the infidel Army&rsquo;s paychecks and other free stuff?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably just as well that he doesn&rsquo;t go.  I have him figured for another Asan Akbar or Nadal Hasan.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s ludicrous to be recruiting practicing muslims into our armed forces anyway, black or semitic or white.  Period.  Tell this guy he gets his wish.  He&rsquo;s out.  AFTER prosecuting him for refusing a lawful order.  Then take NO MORE MUSLIMS.<br>
Any black with one of those NOI (nation of islam) arabized names - tell them no thanks.  You are a practicing muslim, or thought enough of them to take their name, and we are at war with Islamic jihad.  We don&rsquo;t need you or want you.</p>
<p>Why should we give free training to those who would use it against us in future????</p>

		<p>Im certain that the muslim soldier could be reassigned to weather station duty in Greenland or similar. Surely mohammad has no problem with that! </p>
<p>If the Army was to release him, make sure that he is allowed to resign, waiving ALL VA benefits and future claims at the very least. </p>

<p>This highlights the fact that this empire&rsquo;s multicultural army is one that lacks the cohesive unity to be an effective fighting force, since there are MANY enlistees who hold allegiance and loyalty to their home countries and religions over and above loyalty to the US.</p>
<p>Do the foolish multicults also think the tens of thousands of Mexicans in the US military would not fight for their home country if a highly probable war with Mexico were ever begun?</p>
<p>Only a mentally challenged diversity dog could expect that crossing a border would guarantee loyalty by an emigre in all respects to his new country.</p>
<p>This empire was cracking badly before now, but this just highlights one more aspect of the degeneration taking place that will guarantee a shattering of a badly damaged nation that is beyond repair.  It&rsquo;s too late to change the overall situation.</p>
<p>The sub-prime crash was the result of catering to multicultural hordes.  The destruction of this empire will be due to the same reason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just surprised this man didn&rsquo;t frag or machine gun the people he serves with, similar to what occurred to another diversity enlistee whose first loyalty was to his people and religion and not his adopted country and countrymen.</p>
<p>Even an idiot would eventually see the danger of multiculturalism, but a diversity fool is blind to his own stupidity and would himself be destroyed before understanding the error of his perverted belief system.</p>

		<p>Abdo should be dishonarably discharged and fined for being a conscientious objector and a freeloader.<br>
But in todays multicultural imperial empire government and the international corporations who have billions invested in Iraq and Afghanistan will stop at nothing short of national protest to take anyody off of the street and keep them bogged down on the battlefield.<br>
If Americans were educated and patriotic Abdo would not be on American soil and our sons and daughters would not be engaged in the ruling classes corrupt war-for-profit adventures.<br>
Major General Smedley D. Butler once stated that War is a Racket.<br>
Americans must wake up and protest the will of the military industrial complex and an out-of-control government bent on enlisting non-white foreigners and foreign nationals at constitutional expense.<br>

		<p>If we could go back to the Roman Empire, I wonder if we would be reading similar stories of how well their &#8220;multicultural&#8221; military performed in the 50 years before Rome was sacked? </p>
<p>What is wrong with our military? It is not the grunts on the ground, it is the higher command who do not care to win anything but promotions. Just think of the final battle for the bridge in &#8220;Saving Private Ryan&#8221; in 1944, we would have given everyone there a medal, now with CNN on the scene, they would court-martial the survivors. </p>
<p>Imagine if George Patton were serving now, he would bail out as a Captain and go to work for Blackwater. </p>
<p>Deploy this guy - to Antarctica. But then again, the Penguins might be haraam (unclean) and he couldn&rsquo;t go there either. </p>

		<p> The fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan has been going on for years. So he cannot say that he did not realise the chance of being deployed to a combat area. I agree with  ProudtobeWhite; you can learn a lot of with the military training which then can be used against them.</p>

		<p>Efficency and qualified personnel are a thing of the past in the US military.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the muslim who fragged his comrads, or the one who gunned down several others, or the appointment of unqualified blacks to leadership positions to quiet their squeaky wheels, or women in roles they shouldn&rsquo;t be in, the deterioration of the armed forces is indeed a spectacle to behold with utter amazement.</p>
<p>In the past, the US military budget larger than the entire world combined and an insistence on impeccable effeciency and qualifications, made it the 800 pound gorilla that no one dared to confront.  Against other nations, it was always the football team with 600 pound linesmen against other teams that could bring to bear no more than small males with much less than half that size, but no more. </p>
<p>The military budget is shrinking under Obama&hellip;.and by public support&hellip;and it is rapidly deteriorating to a point that will insure its defeat against many second rate powers in the world today.</p>
<p>The day of reconing is near.  The multicults brought the world economies down by giving mortgages to third world hordes and blacks who couldn&rsquo;t pay them, then packaged them and sold them as prime securities worldwide which were bought and held by the hundreds of billions by every country in the world.  When the mortgages holders defaulted by the tens of millions, the US financial system collapsed creating a domino effect worldwide, and it is still running full steam through the system weakening every other financial aspect as well.  Soon it will bring us to the greatest depression the world has ever seen and the greatest civil war in the history of mankind in every nation of the world, some worse than others.</p>
<p>As if that were not enough to caution every multicult to pull back on his desire to continue his agenda, he continues on pushing his agenda everywhere, including Western societies and the military as if he has realized unchecked success instead of abject failure that is bringing us to ruin.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the economic collapse will soon reach critical mass, and the politically correct military will be overwhelmed by 200 million armed citizens who are going to be in the streets, roads and highways.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m betting the ranch that the multicults and the white do-gooders won&rsquo;t realize the horror they have caused and will be calling for more of the same to correct the situation.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t possible to create a solid, strong nation that contains do-gooders and naive fools. If they&rsquo;re not culled the next time around, that too will fail.</p>

		<p>The Army is about to court-martial a lieutenant colonel (doctor) for refusing orders to go to the middle east because he wants proof that Obama was born in th U.S.  Let us see how this loser Abdo is treated.  My guess: he will get a general discharge and may be eligible for some VA benefits.  After all, we have to be P.C. when it comes to minorities.  I hope AR will keep us posted on this story.</p>
