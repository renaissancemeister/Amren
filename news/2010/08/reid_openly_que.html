<p>Reid Openly Questions How Hispanics Can Be in GOP</p>
<p>Speaking to Hispanic supporters last week in his home state of Nevada, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) openly questioned why Hispanics would be Republicans. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know how anyone of Hispanic heritage could be a Republican, OK?&#8221; Reid said. &#8220;Do I need to say more?&#8221; (Politico, Aug. 11, 2010). The next day, Senator Reid&rsquo;s office stood by the statement and used the opportunity to go after his opponent in the November election, Sharon Angle, accusing her of having an &#8220;extreme and dangerous agenda for Hispanic Nevadans.&#8221; (Politico, Aug. 11, 2010). Id.) Reid then sought to shore up his credentials with Hispanics by pointing to Republicans as the reason amnesty legislation did not pass, even though many Democrats continue to oppose such legislation. His campaign spokesman said: &#8220;Despite the efforts of Republicans like Sharron Angle to change the U.S. Constitution and block comprehensive immigration reform,&#8221; a campaign spokesman said, &#8220;Sen. Reid will continue to wake up and fight every day for the interests of Hispanic Nevadans.&#8221; (Id.)</p>
<p>Republicans reacted sharply to the Senate Majority Leader&rsquo;s statement. Sharon Angle, Reid&rsquo;s opponent in the November election, told reporters that &#8220;Harry Reid cannot give any good reasons why people should vote for him, so now he is turning to race and ethnicity.&#8221; (Politico, Aug. 11, 2010). Marco Rubio, the Republican candidate for Florida&rsquo;s Senate seat and the son of Cuban immigrants called Reid&rsquo;s comments &#8220;outrageous&#8221; and &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221; (Politico, Aug. 11, 2010). Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, also objected to Reid&rsquo;s statement, calling them &#8220;extremely condescending and are insulting to all Latinos.&#8221; Aguilar said, &#8220;Hispanic voters don&rsquo;t have a &#8216;herd mentality. They have shown that their vote cannot be taken for granted by any party and that they will support candidates who will defend the principles they believe in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; (Id.)</p>
<p>To many observers, Reid&rsquo;s claim that Hispanics could only rightfully belong to the Democratic Party is further proof of the growing politicization of the immigration debate. In April, when Senator Reid was suffering in state polls, he announced to Hispanic supporters that he would bring up amnesty legislation immediately after the Easter recess. Reid quickly backtracked when he realized many of his Democratic colleagues were not on board with his promise, and there has been little movement on amnesty legislation since. (See FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Update, Apr. 19, 2010). As a result, Democratic leadership is coming under increasing pressure from powerful pro-amnesty forces within the Hispanic community who have run out of patience when it comes to passing &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; immigration reform. (Politico, Aug. 11, 2010). How Democrats will juggle competing interests between pro-enforcement and pro-amnesty constituencies as the election nears remains to be seen.<br>

		<p>Reid&rsquo;s son, Rory, (who, judging from his NV media buys, doesn&rsquo;t have a last name), is facing former Nevada AG and former Federal judge Brian Sandoval for Governor.  Sandoval is apparently Hispanic.  Harry Reid&rsquo;s snark might be more of a matter of circling the wagons around his son than anything.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Sandoval toppled incumbent Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons in the primaries a few months ago.  It&rsquo;s rare that a sitting Governor loses in his/her own party&rsquo;s primaries.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, Harry Reid might be right.  Most Hispanics are welfare-dependent, and the typical Democrat can out-promise almost all Republicans (even the most liberal Republicans) any day of the week when it comes to spending government money for welfare.</p>

		<p>Reid makes an interesting observation, to wit, how can anybody looking to cash in on enormous redistribution programs, which he assumes includes all Hispanics, be a Republican.  It&rsquo;s a most revealing assessment of his true attitude toward Hispanics, that they&rsquo;re just a bunch of free-loading deadbeats who should thus all be reliable Democrat voters, seeking to feed at the government trough would have no place in America. Were it not for this too-often true dismal fact he&rsquo;d leading the charge to have them routed out of the country at the point of a bayonet.</p>

<p>Too bad he won&rsquo;t do the same for white Nevadans.</p>

<p>Yes, they do have a herd mentality. They vote in benefits for themselves, always. The same with blacks. Always at the expense of Whites. Race is first and foremost in their minds and anti-White policies is their game. So-called Hispanic Republicans, are for the most part NOT conservative. Even if a hundred were that leaves tens of millions who are not. How do we fight those numbers? We can&rsquo;t. Converting them is useless, but that is what the neo-cons continually try to do at our expense.</p>

		<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know how any white Americans can be Democrats or, for that matter, Republicans either.  We whites should all be members of the &#8220;American Third Postition&#8221; Party or &#8220;Constitution&#8221; Party.<br>

		<p>Sharon Angle&rsquo;s extreme and dangerous agenda for Hispanic Nevadans is to enforce immigration law.  God bless her.  Yes, we&rsquo;ve come to the point where a leader of the Democratic party can accuse his opponent of extremism for wanting to enforce the law.</p>
<p>I openly question how any white person can be in the Democratic party.  While it is difficult to muster up any enthusiasm for the Republicans, who mainly just care about more tax cuts, funded by borrowing more money rather than by cutting the budget, the Democrats have become virulently anti-white.<br>

		<p>Reid is right, considering most blacks and most hispanics like big government and want to &#8216;stick it to whitey&rsquo; any chance they get.  James Edwards was right in Racism, Schmacism when he said it was a waste of time for Republicans to ignore their white voting base (who are the ones that elect them) in favor of blacks/browns who aren&rsquo;t conservative and who love big government.  Whites and non-whites, for the most part, don&rsquo;t have the same goals and values when it comes to politics and government.  We just don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>Reid may just be referring to his future constituents, the ILLEGAL Hispanics.  While his statement can be accurately applied to Hispanic and black groups and their voting trends, it&rsquo;s obvious he&rsquo;s speaking to the Hispanic groups who advocate illegal immigration/amnesty.</p>

		<p>Reid just gave us a proof why the Democratic Party leadership pushes so much for mass importation of Hispanics: they (the Dems) consider it a strategy to seize a monopoly on political power.</p>
