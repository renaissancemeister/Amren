			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allan Hall, Daily Mail (London), August 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A singer in a girl band is facing the threat of a long jail term for having unprotected sex with several men without telling them she was HIV positive.</p>
<p>Nadja Benaissa appeared in court yesterday charged with grievous bodily harm for allegedly infecting one of her lovers with the virus.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old has also been charged with attempted aggravated assault for allegedly having unprotected sex with two other men who did not contract HIV.</p>
<p>Sorry with all my heart: Nadja Benaissa, singer of German girl band &#8216;No Angels&rsquo;, sits in a courtroom in Darmstadt, Germany, today</p>
<p>&#8216;I am sorry with all my heart&rsquo;: Nadja Benaissa, singer of German girl band &#8216;No Angels&rsquo;, sits in a courtroom in Darmstadt, Germany, today</p>
<p>Benaissa, who is a member of Germany&rsquo;s most successful girl band, No Angels, and has performed in the Eurovision Song Contest, denies infecting anyone deliberately.</p>
<p>But she told the District Court of Darmstadt she was &#8216;careless during those days&rsquo; and admitted she did not tell her sexual partners about her condition, adding tearfully: &#8216;I am sorry with all my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A 34-year-old former lover, who is now HIV positive, claimed the singer&rsquo;s management tried to buy his silence after he became infected.</p>
<p>Brief encounters: Benaissa had a small smile on her face throughout much of the proceedings this morning</p>
<p>The man said he slept with Benaissa five to seven times over a three-month period in 2004.</p>
<p>He maintained a platonic relationship with her after the affair ended, and said it was the star&rsquo;s aunt who told him in 2007 that her niece was HIV positive.</p>
<p>He told the court: &#8216;My quality of life has shrunk enormously. I cannot travel to many countries.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have been told by my doctor my condition can become full-blown Aids at any time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added that Benaissa&rsquo;s management had offered him a deal to remain silent, but claimed he told them he wanted her to go public about her condition and pay 100,000 euros to an Aids research charity.</p>
<p>If she had done this, he insisted, he would not have gone to the police.</p>
<p>Benaissa&rsquo;s lawyer read a statement from her, saying: &#8216;It was said to me that the probability of me passing on the virus was practically zero.</p>
<p>&#8216;Therefore I also concealed the fact that I was infected to my acquaintances.</p>
<p>&#8216;I did not want my daughter to be branded by this. I told the band members because I trusted them. I never made it public because I thought that would mean the end of the band.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In her statement, Benaissa told the court she became addicted to crack cocaine at 14 and that during her pregnancy at 16, she found out that she was HIV positive.</p>
<p>The court heard she had sexual encounters with the three men between 2000 and 2004.</p>
<p>If found guilty, she could be jailed for up to ten years.</p>
<p>No Angels were discovered in 2000 during the TV talent show Popstars.</p>
<p>They are Germany&rsquo;s most successful girl band and sold five million albums from 2000 to 2003.</p>
<p>They reformed in 2007 and competed in the 2008 Eurovision Song contest but only came in 23rd.</p>

		<p>Well she is not Marlene Dietrich that is for sure. The mystery is how easily it appears she got Aids. I think she is being untruthful in her synopsis of her life on the wild side during her early teen years.</p>

Here is a picture of your  &#8216;New German&rsquo;.  Hardly a Brunhilda that Wagner would recognize! But this is Germany now.<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/296skxp" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/296skxp</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia has an article on her.  She is a Moroccan-Serbian (Bosnian?)  with German citizenship; and her long-time boyfriend  and baby-daddy (who gave her AIDS?) is a Senegalese with French citizenship.   The New Europeans!</p>
<p>&#8220;Born in Frankfurt, 1982,  and raised in a Muslim home,  Ben Aissa is the second child born to a Moroccan father, Muhamed Ben Aissa, and a Serbian-German mother.&#8221;   </p>
<p><br>
In 1999, at the age of 17,  Benaissa gave birth to a daughter, Leila Jamila,  which she describes as &#8220;the proudest moment of my life&#8221;.  She was diagnosed with HIV  during a routine screening after becoming  pregnant.  She had been in a relationship for a long time with a Senegalese footballer of French citizenship, Abdou Mbodji, although they have since ended their relationship.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>But there is more!   Aids campaigners are finding fault with the German authorities for their handling of this case! Why prosecute cases such as this? This only causes stigma. According to the BBC:</p>
<p><i>Risk of stigma:<br>
 Aids campaigners have been critical of the  [German] authorities for their handling of Miss Benaissa&rsquo;s case, and warned against a rush to criminalise the transmission of HIV. <br>
Edwin Bernard, a writer and advocate specialising in HIV prosecutions, believes that prosecutions and laws on HIV transmission may do more harm than good in terms of reducing the spread of infections.  &#8220;By singling out HIV, it really promotes fear and stigma,&#8221; Mr Bernard added.</i><br>

<p> I would say it is likely that she caught AIDS from the Senegalese and passed on the &#8220;diversity&#8221; to foolishly infatuated Germans. It is interesting her band was called No Angels  &mdash;  a great understatement.</p>

		<p>It hadn&rsquo;t occured to me at all. I would never have thought of it. (I&rsquo;m rather slow about these things.) But #1 asked a very pertenent question about what she was doing that got her this infection. Yes, under &#8220;normal&#8221; intercourse, for a male to contract HIV from a female is an unlikely thing. But Muslims do like to experience variety. And also, she may have excused her philandering with various boyfriends, because with Muslims (just as with Bill Clinton) if it&rsquo;s not viginal sex, it&rsquo;s not considered sex.  [That will answer #8&rsquo;s question about why wasn&rsquo;t there an honor killing?] </p>

<p>Supposedly you have less than in a one in a thousand chance.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the people who have sex with pop stars probably live very different lives than normal people, the &#8220;victim&#8221; was probably &#8220;partying&#8221;, using needle drugs having orgies/multiple sexual partners (probably men).  Also the odds increase if you have sores or lesions on your genitals from other STDS.</p>

		<p>Whenever something positive is said about a nonwhite citizen of an historically white nation, they always hyphenate their ethnicity such as &#8220;African-American&#8221;  &#8220;Indian-British&#8221;  etc.</p>
<p>But when it is negative news, they label the person by the historic white designation, even though the person in question is not really white.</p>
<p>A &#8220;German&#8221; did it, or a British man (even if he is of Pakistani heritage) etc.</p>
