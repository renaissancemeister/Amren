<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=189965">When American History Is Un-American</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phyllis Schlafly, WorldNetDaily, August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Gov. Jan Brewer signed another law this year that bans schools from teaching classes designed to promote solidarity among students of a particular ethnic group.</p>
<p>{snip} The issue arose because the Tucson School District offers courses in Mexican-American studies (known locally as Raza studies) that focus on that particular group and its influence.</p>
<p>The law doesn&rsquo;t prohibit these classes so long as they are open to all students and don&rsquo;t promote ethnic resentment or solidarity. However, Arizona&rsquo;s superintendent of public instruction, Tom Horne, says the basic theme of the Mexican-American studies program is that Latino students &#8220;were and continue to be victims of a racist American society driven by the interests of middle- and upper-class whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tucson also offers courses especially for African-American and Native-American students. These classes obviously divide the student population by race, a practice we thought was not supposed to be tolerated anymore.</p>
<p>Greta Van Susteren interviewed former Tucson high-school teacher John A. Ward, who was removed from teaching the class for Mexican Americans and reassigned because he questioned the curriculum. For raising concerns, Ward was called a racist. And since he is of Mexican heritage, Ward was also called a vendido (Spanish for sellout).</p>
<p>{snip} Ward said the course {snip} focused solely on the history of the Aztec people, which is the group to which Mexican-American activists ascribe their lineage.</p>
<p>Others who have looked at the books used in these courses say they refer to Americans as &#8220;Anglos&#8221; or &#8220;Euroamericans&#8221; rather than as &#8220;Americans.&#8221; The books do not recognize the United States as a country, but claim Arizona is part of &#8220;Aztlan, Mexico&#8221; (even though the Aztecs never lived in what is now the United States).</p>
<p>{snip} Five chapters promoting Islam were inserted in a world history textbook that is authorized and recommended for seventh-grade students by the state of California.</p>
<p>This world history textbook, called &#8220;History Alive! The Medieval World and Beyond,&#8221; gives the history and beliefs of Islam lengthy and favorable treatment far above and beyond what is given to every other religion, according to Stephen Schwartz in The Weekly Standard (Aug. 9, 2010).</p>
<p>The textbook uses what he calls a &#8220;sanitized vocabulary&#8221; to conceal Muslim practices that are criminal in the United States. These include forced marriage, forced divorce, marriage to children, polygamy and punishments imposed by Shariah law, such as public beheadings, amputations, cruel floggings and stonings.</p>
<p>Muhammad is the only person in this world history textbook who rates an entire chapter. Jesus gets only one sentence {snip}.</p>
<p>The book gives an entirely positive account of Muhammad&rsquo;s teachings, saying, for example, &#8220;He preached tolerance for Christians and Jews as fellow worshipers of the one true God.&#8221; It says nothing about Jesus&rsquo; teachings, but it does describe examples of Christian persecution of non-Christians.</p>
<p>This textbook tells students that the first year in the Muslim calendar is &#8220;the year of Muhammad&rsquo;s hijrah&#8221; (his escape from Mecca to Medina in the year 622). The book doesn&rsquo;t say from what event our Christian calendar dates, instead replacing A.D. with the trendy term &#8220;C.E.&#8221; (Common Era).</p>
<p>William J. Bennetta, editor of The Textbook Letter, published a detailed analysis of this book&rsquo;s distortions, which he calls &#8220;pseudohistory.&#8221; Bennetta documents how it was influenced by a Muslim pressure group, the Council on Islamic Education, which boasts of successfully &#8220;collaborating&#8221; with &#8220;K-12 publishers&#8221; to present a benign view of Islam to impressionable American schoolchildren.</p>

In the mid 1960s, China had their cultural revolution, physically destroying the monuments of past along with their history.</p>
<p>In 1960 America, there was little physical destruction of the past but the groundwork to destroy American history began.</p>
<p>The practice of &#8220;Marxist Deconstruction&#8221; was applied to American history and icons. Our Founding Fathers became little more than slave owners. Our Constitution became, not a document of freedom, but an example of codified oppression.</p>
<p>Marxist Deconstruction is still all the rage on college campuses and new punished works on history. Everyone it seems is trying to redefine the American past as something so evil that it needs to be destroyed so we can create and great, fair, just, and equal society.</p>

		<p>A paragraph below from THE LANGAUGE POLICE: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Know (2003) by NYU education historian Diane Ravitch describes the process by which the distorted history to which public school students are subjected is created:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world history textbooks consistently shade or omit facts that might offend any racial, ethnic, or religious group.  This does not occur by happenstance.  Most of the books prominently identify an advisory board that includes representatives of religious and ethnic groups.  Three publishers  &mdash;  Glencoe, Houghton-Mifflin, and Prentice-Hall  &mdash;  rely on the same individual from the Council on Islamic Education to review their Islamic content.  This may account for the similarity of their material on Islam as well as their omission of anything that would enable students to understand conflicts between Islamic fundamentalism and Western liberalism.  Some textbooks have multicultural advisory committees that include representatives of Jewish, Ukranian-American, Native-American, Asian American, and Afrocentric organizations.  Publishers that invite representatives of religious and ethnic groups to review their materials before publication are practicing self-censorship.&rdquo;  p147</p>
<p>Is your ethnic group represented by an &#8220;advisory group&#8221;?  If not, your children are out of luck.</p>

		<p>As the Arizona governor proceeds with her campaign to enforce laws against illegal immigration, she might want to tackle what is being taught in her state&rsquo;s universities. She&rsquo;ll find that many professors teach that it is unnatural, unethical, and unscientific to control immigration. Governor Brewer could convene a symposium of university deans and department chairmen to find out the extent to which this is happening. Propose a list of a few dozen questions about the problem and give each invitee 20 minutes to talk about them. Many of these professors believe that knowledge is socially constructed, so it is high time that the democratic wishes of the majority of Arizona&rsquo;s people be used to construct some new knowledge. </p>

		<p>So contentious were the textbooks for these &#8220;courses&#8221; they had to be kept unde lock and key when not in use and parents could not obtain the titles of the &#8220;textbooks&#8221; it was such a secret!!</p>
<p>ONLY by court order [??] and freedom of information requests did the titles of the &#8220;textbooks&#8221; become apparent. Then the content.</p>
<p>These are &#8220;hate whitey&#8221;, &#8220;get whitey&#8221; type of material. ONLY encourages division and hate. Very marxist and NOT really textbooks.</p>
<p>I can only imagine at the caliber of the &#8220;teachers&#8221; using these books as instructional material.</p>
<p>This whole subject only became an issue when the parents of white and black kids began complaining that their kids were being attacked without reason on a clockwork basis at school.</p>

		<p>This article brings home the importance of why we need to start running for seats on our local school boards, alla Frank Borzelarie (sorry Frank, I know I spelled that wrong).  Our schools are the front line in this racial/cultural war.  Very few of us like-minded people ever think about running for political office, partly because it&rsquo;s difficult to get on the ballot for state and national offices, but these school board positions are a little easier to take, especially if you&rsquo;re a parent who knows a few other parents that are fed up with the brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in our schools.  There was a situation in a Chicago suburb recently which involved a school banning its girl&rsquo;s basketball team from going to Arizona for the finals.  Sarah Palin commented on it at a rally she headed here around that time.  Many of the parents were upset about their girls being denied a once in a lifetime experience to compete in a sport they had worked so hard at.  I think that situation would have been a perfect oppertunity for someone to take one of those board positions.  We can&rsquo;t wait around for a savior to win the presidency.  We have to start ceasing power from the ground up wherever we can.  Union steward positions are another avenue we need to consider.  I was able to accomplish more than I would have imagined while serving as union steward, and eventually president of my local.  Yes, I sometimes had to represent people I didn&rsquo;t like who deserved worse than management was dishing out to them.  But I learned a lot about politics and law and human nature, all things that made me more effective at standing up for the things important to me.  It&rsquo;s all about power.  You have to take it where you can.</p>

		<p>This is not surprising-the scope of it is, which just shows how far anti-white sentiment has progressed.</p>
<p>The Black Panther Party of the 1960&rsquo;s(remember them?-militant anti-white terrorist organization?)handed out cartoon like literature to young black children portraying police officers as monsters along with other extremely negative portrayals of white society.</p>
<p>Trying to push this benign view of Islam is truly despicable considering their deplorable treatment of woman. TIME magazine&rsquo;s Aug.9th,2010 front cover shows a young Afghan woman with her nose and ears cut off on orders from the Taliban, simply for running away from her husband&rsquo;s parents who beat her and almost killed her. Her brother-in-law held her down and her husband did the cutting. Disgusting bevavior. Disgusting religion.</p>

		<p>This is just another reason why many white Christians send their children to private schools.  Of course, this may often leave the running of public schools in the hands of those who hate Christians and mainstream American culture, but one can hardly blame parents for not sacrificing their offspring to a radical agenda which will push anything, including Islam, that opposes the American way.  </p>

<p>Yeah, those much taller terracotta statues and people with blue eyes, etc. might cause one to question the official account of Chinese history.</p>
<p>There are many examples in human history where the extreme racial minority eventually overtook the majority of the population and created a new population which was a mix of the two. The original people are forgotten.</p>
<p>Asia was once very different than it is today, as was Africa. Pygmies don&rsquo;t create impressive civilizations. </p>

		<p>Fritz: In San Francisco, the majority of white children are sent to private schools that their parents pay big money for,while their huge property taxes support a public school system that is afrocentric and caters the most to black children. A big reason for this is the school board, which is almost all white liberal Marxists and &#8220;people of color&#8221;, however that is defined. When it is election time for the school board, very few of them pay much attention to the candidates.Over the years, we have had way more than one candidate that is a Frank Borzelleri type, but none of them were ever elected.Nothing will improve until we start taking the election process more seriously.</p>

		<p>As to re-writing history to bring it into closer accord with unearthed facts  &mdash;    &mdash;  A bit tangential to this topic, perhaps, but several aspects<br>
of $PLC&rsquo;s &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; have merit.  It would appear<br>
that if legally advised, there is little risk, and much<br>
much potential gain, from re-working/ re-writing / this<br>
&#8220;Teachingt Tolerance&#8221; program ( used widely in schools ) so<br>
as to bring it into accord with the realities faced by such<br>
scholars as Jensen, Brand, Rushton, Gottfredson, Lynn, and <br>
such excellent commentators as Jared Taylor and Steve Sailer.<br>
Legally advised, an effort to make adaptations ought to be safe and dramatic as long as the elements generic to what $PLC has<br>
produced are acknowledged as such and the elements basic to a realistic reworking are identified as such.  <br>
The difference would be a &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; that had the sound efficacy of the Mechanical Engineer rather than the pie-in-the-sky Utopianism turned into failure that characterizes mere<br>
Verbal Engineering.  In prisons there may well be aspects of <br>
untutored, crude self-make &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; that would be<br>
at root consonant with a scientificaly informed effort at friction reduction, etc. Obviously, in prisons breakdowns of tolerance are &#8220;man bites dog&#8221; newsworthy;  successes are muted. By its very nature, a science confronting such troublesome realities as that served by Jensenm, Rushton, et al.  is far more easily assimilated at the practical engineering level of efficacious  &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; in schools (and prisons ) than it is<br>
initially at the conceptual level ( So frequently presenting the<br>
dismissive question:  &#8220;Where will this science lead us?&#8221;) $PLC<br>
has been permitted to gain high ground with a widely popular<br>
&#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; program that can be turned to advantage by<br>
realists to the practical benefit of everyone (except Morri$<br>
Dee$ ).  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Sellout&#8221; a word I heard used in South Africa by the African National Congress to force blacks to join their murdering mobs.  The West never reported on the more bizarre actions of this group.  One day at a meeting called and addressed by the ANC, a black woman asked a question about the ANC&rsquo;s intentions and how they planned to govern the &#8220;New South Africa&#8221; when they won the terror and propaganda war.</p>
<p>The answer was the she was loudly called a &#8220;sellout&#8221; and dragged to the front, beaten and a car-tire put around her neck, petrol poured in and it was lit.  She died in agony.  The black crowd got the message.  &#8220;Do not question the motives of ANC&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was pictured in the south African Press but not the overseas papers or reported on radio/TV out side of South Africa.  That is when the South African government realised they were going to lose any political argument.</p>
<p>The opposition is absolutely ruthless in their quest to win so be warned and ready.  Anything goes and propaganda is important so engage the best to fight those who want to rule the USA.</p>
<p>It is time to regularly broadcast that Islam is NOT a religion, it is a system of government of ignorant peoples just like Marxism.  Do not be afraid to regularly tell this to all and sundry for eventually others who are currently dis-interested spectators will listen and believe the truth.</p>
<p>I am not afraid to be called a racist by the ignorant because when they do I know I am winning any discussion and tell them so.</p>
