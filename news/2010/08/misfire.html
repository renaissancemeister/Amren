<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The New York State Task Force on Police-on-Police Shootings recently concluded that black police officers who wield a gun out of uniform face an elevated chance of getting fatally shot by their fellow officers because of those officers&rsquo; racial bias. The report, publicized by the New York Times and embraced by the Obama administration, is a classic example of fitting nonexistent evidence to a predetermined conclusion. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} What typically happens in such tragic incidents is that an officer in street clothes, his gun drawn, accosts a criminal. He is observed by other officers and fails to comply with their commands. Fourteen of the officers slain since 1981 were white, ten were black, and two were Hispanic. Most of the minority officers have been killed since 1995, and most were off duty. The white officers, by contrast, were almost all killed while on duty in plainclothes assignments. Among officers killed since 1995, minorities outnumber whites more than two to one, whereas whites outnumbered minorities five to one from 1981 to 1994.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the sum of the evidence that the task force offers for its thesis that minority officers who wield their guns while out of uniform are shot because of police bias, while white officers are shot because of nonracial mistakes. The task force rejects the growing racial diversity of police forces nationwide as a possible explanation for the increasing proportion of minority officers among those killed in friendly-fire incidents, though without explaining its reasoning. The report never reveals what being shot while off duty (as opposed to being shot while working in plainclothes) has to do with police bias, though it places great emphasis on the off-duty status of the slain minority officers. It notes the possibility that minority officers are more likely to witness criminal activity in their home communities  &mdash;  and thus more likely to take police action when off duty  &mdash;  than white officers, but declares that the sample of off-duty officers killed since 1981 is too low to hazard any hypotheses on that score. In the next sentence, however, the report concludes from the same small sample that &#8220;regardless of location, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. off-duty officers of color [are] more likely [to be] mistaken for a criminal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when they display their weapons.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} The task force fails to analyze the behavior of the slain officers, though it delicately acknowledges that &#8220;many of the victims failed to comply with commands to freeze or drop their weapons.&#8221; That&rsquo;s an understatement. The brief synopses of the off-duty shooting cases show serious tactical deficiencies on the victims&rsquo; part  &mdash;  and sometimes bad tactical decisions by the confronting cops on the trigger side as well  &mdash;  that have nothing to do with race.</p>
<p>During their training, officers learn: When you&rsquo;re off duty, you&rsquo;ll be mistaken for a crook if you behave like a crook. Never pull your gun unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. If you do pull your gun, make sure that you have your badge in hand. If you take action off duty, identify yourself as a cop and keep your distance from the perp. Few of the victims in the study followed these rules, much less the commands from confronting officers to freeze and drop their weapons, as the task force admits. To make its case that racism lies behind the black officer victimization rate, the task force would have to show that white off-duty officers who made similar tactical errors did not get shot. This it has not done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also troubling that the report frequently acknowledges huge inadequacies in existing data, yet proceeds full speed ahead with its conclusions. For instance, in the New York Police Department  &mdash;  the only department to have collected data on nonfatal shootings  &mdash;  there were four nonfatal shootings of white officers from 1995 to 2009, but none of black officers. Had the task force been able to analyze nonfatal shootings nationwide, it might have reached a different picture of both the incidence and causes of friendly-fire shootings.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe not. {snip} The report places great weight on a single experiment that found that officers in a video simulation took a few microseconds longer to decide not to &#8220;shoot&#8221; an unarmed black suspect than to decide not to shoot an unarmed white suspect. The fact that officers using the video simulation did not shoot unarmed black suspects any more often than unarmed white suspects  &mdash;  a finding that undermines the biased-shooting theory  &mdash;  is acknowledged by the task force only in passing.</p>
<p>The New York State Task Force on Police-on-Police Shootings has not done the law enforcement profession any favors with its incomplete study. {snip} Above all, its message that black officers are at risk from the prejudices of their fellow officers is unjustified and poisonous.<br>

		<p>The details escape me, but I think the Rampart Crash scandal in Los Angeles blew open because a white on-duty LAPD officer had to use lethal force against a black man who flashed gang signs and pointed a gun at the cop, from the black&rsquo;s own SUV.  The black turned out to be an LAPD cop, and was essentially a gang banger in his own right.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone like AmRen can make this investigation, after a generous financial grant towards this endeavor.</p>

		<p>Black off duty officers get shot for the same reason black armed criminals get shot.<br>
Failure to obey commands.  Root cause of the failure to obey commands in a deadly situation?  Lower intelligence and higher levels of &#8220;attitude&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Resisting arrest is the standard for black people.  Watch any police show and you will see black person after black person resist arrest and many times violently.  Black people bring violent interactions with the police on to themselves because they resist arrest and act violently.</p>

		<p>To be brutally honest with all of you and myself too, if I did hear a car alarm or a bank robbery alarm and the hue and cry issued, and did see a black man running away from the scene of the crime, I would instantly think the running black man was the perp. NOT always understanding that could be an off-duty or plainclothes cop chasing the bad guy. Just the way it is.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The number of blacks elected as police chief in Florida and black cops in general, commit crimes at a far greater degree than whites per their portion of the population.</p>
<p>Katrina was not an anomaly.  It&rsquo;s how black cops behave when they think no one is watching and society breaks down.</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m not aware of any police officers being killed off duty in this area, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department has certainly had its share of bad apples. One of the more notable cases involved an AA hire by the name of Myron Powell. Even after several recommendations that he should have been terminated during his probationary period, the Chief overrode those and kept him on the force. Powell is currently incarcerated for murder, attempted murder, and robbery. (Google Myron Powell IPD and the first article should be an archived copy from the Indianapolis Star.) Powell&rsquo;s stepson was another high profile failure that resulted in jail time. To be fair, there have been white officers who were screw ups, but there tends to be a much higher percentage of black officers whose careers end up being shot down in flames. I don&rsquo;t know if Indianapolis is still under a &#8220;consent decree&#8221; to hire otherwise non qualified minorities. </p>
<p>The following comes from &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;. It would be curious to see what would happen if IMPD were allowed to follow an example that the NYPD used in 1939. In April 1939, the NYPD hired 300 new trainees out of an applicant pool of 30,000. The test was weighted 2/3rd mental and 1/3rd physical. Out of the this pool, not everyone accepted the offer, but everyone in this candidate class was in the top 350 out of 30,000. As a group, they had an exceedingly high number of officers who held high ranks in the department. A number of those who left the police force ended up being very successful in business, law, industry, and other areas. I suspect that if you had a few candidate classes full of people with IQ&rsquo;s that would qualify them for Medical School that it would seriously upset the balance in most police departments.  </p>

		<p>When will all people, especially blacks, admit to the fact that when law enforcement officers of any race confront a young black male in possession of a firearm they automatically believe they are dealing with a criminal, and with good cause. This comes from years of observing the news and on the job and real life experience. The tragedy of plain clothes black cop&rsquo;s being shot will go on until the black community gets it house in order and puts an end to the imbecilic mind boggling amount of crime committed by blacks. It has become a reflexive reaction to think this way when dealing with black males.</p>
