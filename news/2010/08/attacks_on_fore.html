			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Mundy, Financial Times (London), August 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bright Magomora took no chances when a crowd gathered outside his small shop, hammering on the walls with sticks and shouting that he should go home to Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran away,&#8221; says Mr Magomora, who had spent five years in the South African shanty town of Kya Sands, north of Johannesburg. &#8220;They wanted to beat me up or kill me, saying that we foreigners should go back to our place. Then they took everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Troops were deployed in South Africa&rsquo;s townships last month as the government sought to avoid a repeat of the anti-foreigner bloodshed in May 2008 that left 62 people dead and displaced about 100,000. The renewed tension followed reports that migrant workers from African nations were being threatened with violence if they stayed in South Africa after the football World Cup.</p>
<p>Several immigrants were murdered in the weeks following the tournament and many foreign-owned businesses looted or destroyed, particularly in townships around Cape Town, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth. Many foreigners are believed to have left the country in fear of their lives.</p>
<p>But experts have praised the government&rsquo;s speedy response. Soldiers and police largely restored calm to the affected areas.</p>
<p>The fear of a post-World Cup embarrassment has focused attention on a problem that never went away, says Loren Landau, director of the Forced Migration Studies Programme at Witwatersrand University. &#8220;May 2008 represented a peak of violence that we haven&rsquo;t seen since. But there are attacks every week,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>In a country where unemployment officially stands at 25 per cent, many South Africans blame foreign workers for taking valuable jobs and driving down wages.</p>
<p>Mr Landau says that unscrupulous politicians often exploit these tensions and encourage violence. In particular, they play on the caricature of migrants as criminals. &#8220;Getting tough on foreigners can show you&rsquo;re active in combating crime. And you can then distribute their property to your associates,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Businessmen who feel threatened by foreign competitors also organise violence, according to Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh of Lawyers for Human Rights. &#8220;Somali, Ethiopian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi shopkeepers in townships often band together, which gives them increased purchasing power. South African businesses typically haven&rsquo;t done the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Ms Ramjathan-Keogh rejects suggestions that a sense of superiority over other Africans lies behind the attacks. &#8220;Many poor South Africans are unhappy with service delivery and a number of other issues. It&rsquo;s convenient to direct that dissatisfaction at foreign nationals because they&rsquo;re vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Campaigners believe the recent security operation has weakened the &#8220;climate of impunity&#8221; that prevailed in 2008, when people attacked foreigners with little fear of consequences. Twelve arrests have been made in Kya Sands alone.</p>
<p>But the government has been criticised for refusing to accept anti-foreigner violence is a specific problem. Nathi Mthethwa, the police minister, has described these attacks as &#8220;purely criminal activity&#8221;. He denied that fear explained the departure of migrants since the World Cup, claiming they were seasonal workers who had simply reached the end of their employment.</p>
<p>But Jacques Kikonga Kamanda, secretary of the Co-ordinating Body of Refugee Communities, insisted the outflow was &#8220;because of the threats  &mdash;  many of our community members have told us they were warned to leave, or they would be dealt with&#8221;.</p>
<p>The police are often unpopular in the townships, partly because of memories of apartheid repression. But sometimes they are complicit in harassing foreigners, says Abdul Hakim Mohamad, chairman of the Somali Community Board. He says 66 Somalis were unlawfully arrested in May in the township of Etwatwa, when at least one shop was looted by police.</p>
<p>In Kya Sands, however, Zimbabweans credit the police with restoring calm. &#8220;It&rsquo;s fine now, because they are here,&#8221; says Nomsa Ndlovu. But the threats have not stopped.</p>
<p>Ms Ndlovu predicted: &#8220;When they [the police] leave, the violence will continue.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I hope they realize that, under Apartheid, the identities and lifestyles of ALL tribal groups native to South Africa were protected, because the white government understood the idea of pride in one&rsquo;s people. Nowadays, the black (Zulu or Xhose dominated??) government ignores the rights of the people to protect their identities, even though they give them the &#8220;rights&#8221; which the former Apartheid government denied them.</p>

		<p>In a country where unemployment officially stands at 25 per cent</p>
<p>I wonder how far the U.S. REALLY IS from this % of unemployment, Germany went to war with, if I recall, a 30% unemployment rate and they were happy to do so. This is coming to the U.S. too and I seriously believe, as do many, that it is gonna be, as the black Rev. James David Manning says, UGLY!</p>

		<p>Currently nearly the complete civil service is on strike.</p>
<p>Blacks have attacked white schools in some instances.</p>
<p><a href="https://afrikaner-genocide-achives.blogspot.com/2010_08_25_archive.html" rel="nofollow">https://afrikaner-genocide-achives.blogspot.com/2010_08_25_archive.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;The strike has seen the near-total collapse of public hospital services â€“ causing scores of deaths. Schools are closed down, law-courts and other essential public services have been disrupted for over a week now as the country&rsquo;s civil servants are waging warfare on the country&rsquo;s taxpayers, demanding an 8.6% salary increase and a R1 000 monthly housing allowance. The civil servants have rejected the ANC-regime&rsquo;s offer of a seven percent salary increase plus a monthly R700 housing allowance&#8221;.</p>

		<p>During the FIFA Soccer W.C., masses of police were moved from their normal areas to make sure that the football went off well for far too many people had invested much money into its success with the rewards that would come afterward.  But no reports have been forthcoming about the increases in crime in the vacated areas where ordinary South Africans would be left at risk, many being of course, black South Africans many more who now live in squatter camps (some being moved or cleaned up for FIFA) under the new ex-terrorist government.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that many South Africans now accept the high levels of crime and have adjusted to it, an odd human trait.</p>
<p>There was one interview on Euro TV where a South African black squatter camp citizen remarked on the thought that he may be dead very soon with the high levels of violent crime there.</p>
<p>Of course the SA Govt. smooths over the levels as tourism is a major industry there.</p>
<p>Most at risk are the foreigners from Zimbabwe who have moved to SA as they were starving in Zim which when it was called Rhodesia, was the bread basket of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Watch out for much begging for AID when the solar global warming really hits Africa and we are all blamed for it with our man-made CO2 gases.</p>

		<p>Most American media NEVER reports the real truth about South Africa. For one thing, Mandela is their hero, especially the neocons hero. In fact, they ignore the crimes against Whites just as they do here in America, for fear of waking up the White slumbering masses. Can&rsquo;t have them wake up to their own genocide, now can we?</p>
<p>Do you see the connection between there and here? </p>

		<p>Inter-ethnic violence? Another sign that South Africa is becoming your typical majority rule African country. Of course, this will be ignored in the Western media, or be blamed on &#8220;apartheid.&#8221; </p>

		<p>When Henry Kissinger went to South Africa in 1976 and threatened<br>
then prime minister John Vorster with the cut-off of South African oil supplies from Iran, world sanctions, and the devaluation of South Africas gold supplies, for supporting the war in Rhodesia, America did nothing to stop it.<br>
The American people stood by unattended while Washington and London then forced the ANC regime on South Africa.<br>
Today Rhodesia is long dead and its successor Zimbabwe has crumbled to the ground over black crime while Zimbabweans flee to South Africa to endanger the South African economy.<br>
Americans, in part, owe South Africa its freedom from black rule for being dispondent while international socialists continue to drive down their government only to get to ours.<br>
America must make its voice heard and enforce the constitution before the bell of tyranny tolls against God and country.</p>

<p>Well, the blacks in Zimbabwe are seeing the result of parasitic encroachment from outside their area, which is what they were guilty of when they came in droves, seeking handouts from the white population who settled the land and built a beautiful civilization on the unoccupied area and called it Rhodesia.</p>
<p>Like do-gooder fools in the US, some whites in the population supported the incoming hordes and others wanted them for cheap labor, because they were too lazy to do the work themselves.</p>
<p>Non-white hordes cannot provide for themselves and seek white handouts the world over.  The do-gooder whites in the population should be forced out right along with the tribesmen.</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t have said it better myself.  Self serving white do-gooders of all political persuasions will have a lot to answer for when the economic bell tolls.  It&rsquo;s getting closer.  Please, do-gooders&hellip;don&rsquo;t ask me for help when the do-do hits the fan.  You have been warned.</p>
