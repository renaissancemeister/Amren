<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/nyregion/26names.html?_r=1">New Life in U.S. No Longer Means New Name</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Roberts, New York Times, August 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For many 19th- and 20th-century immigrants or their children, it was a rite of passage: Arriving in America, they adopted a new identity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The New York Times examined the more than 500 applications for name changes in June at the Civil Court in New York. {snip}. Only a half dozen or so of those applications appeared to be obviously intended to Anglicize or abbreviate the surnames that immigrants or their families arrived with from Latin America or Asia. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sociologists say {snip} that blending in by changing a name is not as effective for Asians and Latin Americans who, arguably, may be more easily identified by physical characteristics than some Europeans were in the 19th century and early 20th century.</p>
<p>Also, at least in certain circumstances, affirmative action and similar programs have transformed ethnic identity into a potential asset.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>

		<p>Bravo to the New York Times for reporting, &#8220;Also, at least in certain circumstances, affirmative action and similar programs have transformed ethnic identity into a potential asset.&#8221;</p>
<p>How much of an asset is clinging to one&rsquo;s ethnic identity? In admissions to elite universities, belonging to a favored ethnicity counts very much indeed. All other qualifications being equal, </p>
<p>&#8220;When lower-class whites [who can&rsquo;t pay tuition and don&rsquo;t increase diversity] are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Non-white people should keep their names because they bring associations to white names that are unattractive.  Latinos have Spanish or Portuguese names.  Spain and Portugual are European countries.  Yet when most people hear these Spanish or Portuguese names think of bean pickers, drug kingpins, welfare, gangs, high school dropouts and all the other associations with Latinos instead of white Europeans.  White people avoid naming their children Tyson or Terrell because it&rsquo;s now associated with black people therefore would be a burden for the child.</p>

<p>Right. Easier now to get entrance into Harvard if your first name is Chong or Amari. You no longer have to call yourself Charles or Adam or such.</p>

		<p>Indeed, that is true BlueBlood. I have no children but if I ever do, I will give them Slavic or Celtic names that are not associated with blacks. I have yet to meet any of them with names such as Vika or Meav. It pains me that Obama named one of his kids Sasha, a very common but good Russian name for either a boy or a girl&hellip;&hellip;:-(<br>

		<p>Sasha is a short form of Alexander/Alexandra.  My name also reflects my heritage.</p>
<p>One set of great-grandparents, Michel and Maria Omelianchik, changed their names to Michael and Mary Omell.  I saw this in the census records.</p>
<p>Who remembers seeing An American Tail, that Don Bluth cartoon from 25 years ago?  I remember the little girl mouse, Tanya, asking her father why they changed her name to Tilly.  My guess  &mdash;  so they would assimilate.</p>

		<p>Sam Francis developed this topic very deeply about 20 years ago.  His point, which was based on a book by an author whose name I don&rsquo;t remember, is that, aside from the fact that immigrants in the past were almost all white, the reason why the new largely non-white immigrants aren&rsquo;t assimilating (other than the fact that they can&rsquo;t) is because the informal societal mechanisms which compelled earlier waves of immigrants to assimilate are now thought of as illegal civil rights violations.</p>

		<p>Maybe times have changed and the ethnic composition of immigrants have changed. But if we must have immigrants, and we will, regardless of logical objections to further immigration, we ought to pressure if not require immigrants to adopt English or Scots-Irish surnames. If the immigrants are afraid of discrimination, they should favor this. If I see a six syllable unspeakable African name on a job application, it might find its way to the &#8220;out&#8221; file very quickly. Also those Chinese names that begin in X have no place here. There is a reason X is not used as a name beginner by Americans, unless they are Black Muslims. </p>
<p>If a job applicant&rsquo;s name is Joe Smith, assuming he&rsquo;s smart enough to omit the fact on his resume that he graduated from the University of Lagos in Business Administration, I&rsquo;ll see him for an interview assuming he went or claimed he went to a relevant US school and has suitable job experience(or so he claims).</p>
<p>Then, after the interview, phone or personal, he goes into the out file.</p>
