<h1>Statement by the President on the Occasion of Ramadan</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, The White House, August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Office of the Press Secretary<br>
For Immediate Release<br>
August 11, 2010</p>
<p>On behalf of the American people, Michelle and I want to extend our best wishes to Muslims in America and around the world. Ramadan Kareem.</p>
<p>Ramadan is a time when Muslims around the world reflect upon the wisdom and guidance that comes with faith, and the responsibility that human beings have to one another, and to God. This is a time when families gather, friends host iftars, and meals are shared. But Ramadan is also a time of intense devotion and reflection  &mdash;  a time when Muslims fast during the day and pray during the night; when Muslims provide support to others to advance opportunity and prosperity for people everywhere. For all of us must remember that the world we want to build  &mdash;  and the changes that we want to make  &mdash;  must begin in our own hearts, and our own communities.</p>
<p>These rituals remind us of the principles that we hold in common, and Islam&rsquo;s role in advancing justice, progress, tolerance, and the dignity of all human beings. Ramadan is a celebration of a faith known for great diversity and racial equality. And here in the United States, Ramadan is a reminder that Islam has always been part of America and that American Muslims have made extraordinary contributions to our country. And today, I want to extend my best wishes to the 1.5 billion Muslims around the world  &mdash;  and your families and friends  &mdash;  as you welcome the beginning of Ramadan.</p>
<p>I look forward to hosting an Iftar dinner celebrating Ramadan here at the White House later this week, and wish you a blessed month.</p>
<p>May God&rsquo;s peace be upon you.<br>

<p>No, Big Chief, it&rsquo;s the world that <i>you</i> want to build, and the changes (or is it &#8220;transformations?&#8221;) that you demand we make in <i>our</i> hearts.  I want no part of your Jihad Amerika.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d certainly be interested in a printed breakdown of that &#8220;role&#8221; in &#8220;advancing justice, progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.&#8221;  So far, I can&rsquo;t think of any examples off the top of my White Racist head.</p>

<p>Aha!  The Big Chief exposes the <i>real</i> reason he&rsquo;s so in love with the Sons of the Prophet!  What a perfect model for the Brown Amerika he and his fellow conspirators have planned for us!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Islam has always been part of America&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Pity no one told George Washington and Ben Franklin.  Imagine their surprise to discover that they were really fighting for a mosque on every block.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m beginning to suspect that the Big Chief actually <i>believes</i> this drivel.  He&rsquo;s not just malicious, he&rsquo;s borderline insane.<br>

<p>Well, I wonder what would happen if Obama while visting the mideast gave a speech reading as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;And here in Saudi Arabia (or Iraq, Iran, etc.), I&rsquo;d like to remind you that Christianity and Judaism have always been part of the middle east and that Christians and Jews have made extraordinary contributions to this part of the world.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Obama portrays Ramadan as just a lovefest. Well, it hasn&rsquo;t been too successful. Islam is a bigoted, intolerant religion that revels in violent suppression of its religious rivals. Hussein Obama however just can&rsquo;t get enough of Ramadan. Is he going to fast like his fellow Muslims? No he&rsquo;s hooked on Five Guys Burgers and Michelle on gourmet food.</p>
<p>But he sure is a good PR flak for these intruders.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;These rituals remind us of the principles that we hold in common, and Islam&rsquo;s role in advancing justice, progress, tolerance, and the dignity of all human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seriously General Secretary BO, since when does: gang rapes, honor killings, female genital mutilations, terrorism, homicide bombings, and self-immolating fanaticisms, have anything to do with, &ldquo;&hellip;advancing justice, progress, tolerance, and the dignity of all human beings?&rdquo; Perhaps, in comparison to the greater atrocities of multiculturalism and its cherishing of these Islamic barbarities that are but a component of its vaster and more abominable depravities, there could be some leeway, but not much.  Or put another way, Islam in the West is but a parasitical sub-cult, to a larger and infinitely more malignant cult, diversity worship. </p>
<p>Next: &ldquo;And here in the United States, Ramadan is a reminder that Islam has always been part of America and that American Muslims have made extraordinary contributions to our country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed they have, from the Barbary pirates&rsquo; attacks on our shipping in the 1800s straight up to 9/11/2001 and beyond, &ldquo;extraordinary contributions&rdquo; have been directed toward this country by the &ldquo;Religion of Peace,&rdquo; endlessly. However, most of these are hardly what could be called advancing civilization or elevating humanity to universal dignity. They are almost totally acts of debased and greedy anti-Western hatred and savagery. </p>
<p>Of course, with a Muslim converted to multiculturalism occupying the White House, what else would be expected, right Comrade Obama?</p>

		<p> So is Obama going to also issue a humble pie, &#8220;We&rsquo;re all Muslims now&#8221; proclamation for Diwali, the major Hindu festival? There are probably as many Hindus in the U.S. as Muslims.</p>
<p> How about Buddhist, Sikh and Shinto holidays? Or does he only get all misty-eyed about the religion that many still suspect he grew up in   &mdash;   one way or another? The only one that has been an excuse to murder thousands of Americans? The only one that has made mass murder while committing suicide, an express pass into heaven?</p>
<p> Think about this: Obama&rsquo;s mealy-mouthed statement implies that we must be &#8220;tolerant&#8221; of all faiths   &mdash;   especially Islam, which he laughably insists that Islam has always been &#8220;a part of America.&#8221; Ha! DOUBLE Ha! Christianity says, &#8220;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&#8221; Hinduism says, &#8220;There are many paths to God.&#8221; But Islam says, &#8220;There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his prophet.&#8221; Who is tolerant, and who is rigid and implacable? Who has made converts among those who were truly persuaded   &mdash;   and who has converted by the sword? Anyone able to read and reason should be able to answer that question, and in short order.  </p>

And just what EXTRAORDINARY contributions have muslims made to this country? I personally can&rsquo;t think of any, unless Obama thinks that 9\11 was a muslim &#8220;contribution&#8221;.

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised there&rsquo;s not a special greeting from the most prominent Amerikan muslim, Major Nidal Hasan, who did his islamic duty to advance justice, progress, tolerance, blah, blah, bah&hellip;</p>
<p>How about this piece of a bad satire:<br>
&#8220;And here in the United States, Ramadan is a reminder that Islam has always been part of America and that American Muslims have made extraordinary contributions to our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really? I majored in American history and political science - I must have missed that class. Perhaps the Revolutionary War would have ended sooner if Washington&rsquo;s army didn&rsquo;t have to stop for prayers every 3 hours.</p>
<p>This is really a disgrace. It sends the wrong message to our enemies, and our friends.</p>
<p>If he wants to say a simple &#8220;Happy Ramadan&#8221; - fine. But all the flowery double-talk and Orwellian linguistics tells me that 2012 can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p>

		<p>What?  The rookie-in-chief&rsquo;s statement is outrageous and full of bald face lies.  Clearly the president does not know American or world history and is equally ignorant of Islam.</p>
<p>First, most Muslims have been recent arrivals, post 1965.  To date they have not assimilated into American society nor have they shown any interest in doing so.  Quite the opposite, they demand that America treat them special and according to their Islamic culture.</p>
<p>In the good old days immigrants were expected to assimilate into American culture.  The Muslims have not done so and they frequently thumb their nose at America culture.  Interesting, since they enjoy the benefits of our freedom and openness.</p>
<p>America society is a stark contrast to Saudi Arabia, Iran and other Islamic republics.  Makes one wonder, why are they here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering, did the president make any statements regarding Christianity this past Christmas season?</p>
<p>While this ignorant president makes extremely foolish statements, his wife and friends vacation in Spain.  While there, maybe the first lady should ask the king and queen over lunch about parts of Spain being conquered by the Muslims and the hardship required to recover their land.  A learning opportunity!</p>
<p>The current occupants of the white house demonstrate that elections have consequences.  I do hope &ldquo;we the people&rdquo; have awakened and in the future will cast a more considered vote.</p>

<p>First, before we get too carried away, this suspect is a Christian Arab who is a citizen of the certain country to which he tried to flee.  So he wasn&rsquo;t Muslim   &mdash;   We know that, if any libs try to catch us on a technicality.</p>
<p>The main point here is that two days ago, cops in Northern Virginia were so sure that this was a white man.  Heck, he had to be white, because professional profilers with fancy titles at Whatachamcdoogle State University said so!  All I know is that the last time D.C. cops were so sure that a serial killer running around town was a white man, it turned out to be two black men.  As we recall, among those cops that assured us that they were seeking a white man in a white van was that illustrious Dr. Moose of Montgomery County, Maryland.  (Wonder where he is now.)  </p>
<p>Rule of thumb:  When D.C. cops say a serial killer is a white man, it&rsquo;s not a white man.</p>

		<p>This statement by Obama is patently ridiculous.  The simple truth is that if Muslims had tried to settle in America in 1800 they&rsquo;d have been hounded, stoned, and run out of the country.  America then was an overwhelmingly Protestant Christian nation, with an uneasy tolerance for Jews and Papists, both groups of which made it a point to maintain a low profile and not offend the majority.</p>

Geez, that is not a group of people I want voting in the next election or any election for that matter.  What the heck is wrong with white Americans these days?

		<p>A silly statement, but he was just trying to be nice. Truth has never been an essential ingredient in his speeches (nor in that of any other recent President). Anyway, Muslims must know by now that he doesn&rsquo;t really care about them: as has become painfully obvious, all that he genuinely cares about is the African-American agenda (i.e., increasing the flood of money that isn&rsquo;t called &#8220;reparations&#8221; but really is).</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;On behalf of the American people, Michelle and I want to extend our best wishes to Muslims in America and around the world. Ramadan Kareem.<br>
I look forward to hosting an Iftar dinner celebrating Ramadan here at the White House later this week, and wish you a blessed month.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This White House statement, issued on 8/11,2010, is simply astounding in light of the fact that it is exactly 9 years short by one month since the attacks of 9/11/2001. </p>
<p>Considering the intense emotions that gripped the nation on 9/12/2001, who would have believed, back then, that just nine years later we would have  a  (crypto?)-Moslem president   &mdash;   the son and step-son of Moslems, educated and raised in a Moslem home   &mdash;   sitting in the Oval Office, issuing Islamic holiday greetings?  And holding Ramadan dinners in the White House???  </p>
<p>Have we been conquered without a shot, or what?  </p>
<p>He speaks of a religion of &#8220;Wisdom and guidance&#8221;.  He refers to the &#8220;Responsibility of human beings to one another&#8221;.   Whatever can this man be talking about, in light of the series of FURTHER ATROCITIES that have been committed SINCE 9/11?  Have the lessons of 9/11, and everything thereafter,  been forgotten so quickly?  Or is &#8220;glossed over&#8221; the better term? </p>
<p>In every case   &mdash;   from Pres. Bush in the US, to Queen Elizabeth in Britain, to Queen Juliana in the Netherlands, the President of Spain, the Queen of Denmark   &mdash;   we have seen heads of state rush to praise and pacify the Moslems after every Islamic-committed atrocity, as well as to warn and chastize the angry citizenry from reprisals. Can this uniform response be coincidence?  After a continuing series of shootings, bombings, beheadings, plane attacks, riots, assassinations, death threats, we are constantly preached to by those on high about &#8220;the religion of peace&#8221;.  Simply incredible!  Those fools who preach such deception should be booed out of the public arena, and never given a public hearing again. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;These rituals remind us of the principles that we hold in common, and Islam&rsquo;s role in advancing justice, progress, tolerance, and the dignity of all human beings.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>And just what are those principles that we hold in common? Can anyone be specific?  And just what has been Islam&rsquo;s role in advancing &#8220;tolerance, dignity, and progress&#8221;? Please tell! We&rsquo;d like to know.  This little sermonette is a monumental piece of babble and vagueness that sounds great but says nothing. It&rsquo;s backed up with no facts, no reality, just a lot of good-sounding euphemisms that pander to the Islamic mass.</p>
<p>(Btw, since when is it necessary for an American president to pander to the Islamic mass?  When did that come about?  Like so many other things, all of a sudden it&rsquo;s there and we never knew about it before.)  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Ramadan is a celebration of a faith known for great diversity and racial equality.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>Aha! I suspect that here we have the real key to his enthusiasm   &mdash;   the racial indifference of Islam. Regardless of whether Obama remains a practicing Moslem or not, it is less the religious but more the racial aspect that would (for obvious reasons) appeal to a mixed-breed such as he. Finally, something makes sense.</p>

In this article the author also complained about the Arab racism against blacks.<br>
What kind of diversity and tolerance is Obama talking about   &mdash;   the kind of &#8220;if you don&rsquo;t believe what you&rsquo;re told you&rsquo;ll be stoned to death&#8221;?<br>
The tolerance which the Quran means when talking about a stone which says &#8220;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&#8221;<br>
The sharia type diversity-tolerance-progress? The equality one can see in the Muslim states where the &#8220;average Ali&#8221; and the Sheik have the same wealth and opportunity?</p>
<p>Of course we have to understand that this is not the real Islam &hellip; which seems to by very shy and hiding.</p>

<p>Paisan, at first glance Obama&rsquo;s statement about &#8220;Islam always being a part of America&#8221; sounds preposterous on the face of it, but, upon closer examination, it is true. Martin Luther King liked to brag that, &#8220;before the Pilgrims were here, we (Bantus) were here&#8221;. Some of the slaves sold by African tribal chieftains to Arabs, probably made their way to the U.S.</p>
<p>In view of Obama&rsquo;s statement, I &#8216;d like to see Jared Taylor stand up and say, &#8220;Yes, Mr. President, let us not forget it was Muslims who imported slaves from Africa to the harems in the Middle East, and also sold some to the European colonial powers, to bring to the New World. Let us not forget that in Muslim nations like Mauritania and Sudan, slavery is still practiced to this day&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Obama didn&rsquo;t write this nonsense. He&rsquo;s just a puppet for the Goldman Sachs crowd. In reality, one of his speech writers cranked it out, then his staff propped him up behind his desk and he read it off his teleprompter. Speeches like this are completely meaningless ceremonial gestures to our glorious multiculturalism. Maybe Obama believes it. Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t. Maybe he isn&rsquo;t even conscious. There&rsquo;s really no way to tell. One of the other posters was absolutely right when he said that GW Bush could have delivered the same speech. In fact, Bush DID deliver speeches like this on Ramadan. For example, check out this speech Bush delivered at the Islamic Center of Washington in 2002:</p>

		<p>The problem here is that Obama doesn&rsquo;t really know America. His early years were all spent outside this country. He was educated in non-us schools. His history of America comes from non-US sources. As someone who is married to a non-us person, I can tell you what the other world thinks America is .. I don&rsquo;t even know the word to use here. Sometimes they portray America as a gold city where people fly around in jet packs. Sometimes they portray America as ghettos with gang warfare every night. Sometimes they portray America as mindless idiots making moonshine. All of these images come from popular media. And everyone who lives in America knows popular media is as accurate as a drunk reciting the alphabet. But that&rsquo;s just one of the problems with Obama. The other problem is his parents. He&rsquo;s totally surrounded by American bashing communists who abandoned him. His crusading communist father abandoned him, his world traveler mother abandoned him, grand parents pawn him off to a self admitted communist pedophile to mentor him. It&rsquo;s no wonder he has an incomplete education and distorted view of our country. How could Americans elect a man who has no idea what being an American is, I do not know, but you are seeing the results of it now. I think that you can see this in the polls. People like the man, his personality, but he&rsquo;s clueless about the facts and lives in a bubble. Not unlike Carter. Nice guy, but totally w/o the skill set needed to do the job. Or I could be wrong and Obama could be a marxist economic terrorist with narcissistic personality disorder bent on destroying this country at all costs. Either way, not good for America.<br>

		<p> &#8220;Is it just me, or does Ramadamadingdong seem to get earlier and earlier every year?   Now, it&rsquo;s starting in early August. What gives? Is it an issue with the Muslim luni-solar calendar?&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;  QD</p>
<p><br>
Yes, it is. It&rsquo;s the Moslem calendar.</p>

&#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it turned out that Obama actually assumed that Muslims in fact were passengers on the Mayflower. After all, many blacks believe that &ldquo;black people built America&rdquo;<br>
  &mdash;  John<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Yes, built it and  discovered it too.   We often read claims that there were Moslems and Africans on Columbus&rsquo; ships.  That&rsquo;s probably part of Obama&rsquo;s reasoning.  In fact, I believe I have read the assertion that it was a Moorish lookout (allegedly) who was the first of Columbus&rsquo; crew to sight America.  There is no documented record of this   &mdash;   so obviously Columbus cheated the man and doctored the records, in order to grab the credit and glory for himself!</p>
<p>Thus, they &#8220;discovered&#8221; America! </p>
<p>Any bare facts (if they are even that) can be manipulated to prove whatever the revisionists want.  And so, the great Crispus Attucks (not Paul Revere or George Washington) was responsible for bringing about the American Revolution. </p>
<p>Ah, yes,  more black history that whites have been suppressing all these years. But the truth will come out!</p>

		<p>&#8220;African-Americans were instrumental in the American Revolution in spite of George Washington&rsquo;s attempt to ban them from the Continental Army. <br>
Even Washington eventually had to face up to the fact that African-Americans were the best soldiers in the army. The Revolution itself began with a black man, Crispus Attucks, the first martyr of the war.&#8221;<br>

<p>Stop this constant bickering about your pimp being less dangerous than anothers pimp.  They are all pimping our country to the world, the third world.  We are destroyed in the name of diversity and one world government with just a few being left wealthy and powerful.</p>

		<p>&#8220;These rituals remind us of the principles that we hold in common, and Islam&rsquo;s role in advancing justice, progress, tolerance, and the dignity of all human beings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, Islam has done a really great job in advancing the dignity of women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ramadan is a celebration of a faith known for great diversity and racial equality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t the Obama administration recently say that al-Queda was &#8220;racist&#8221; because they only allowed blacks to be suicide bombers and didn&rsquo;t give them leadership positions?</p>

		<p>What is comical in all of this is how easily official,liberal,  media-savvy America has been misled into thinking the world is going their way. It is not. It is coming their way, and that is all.<br>
Multiculturalism is a myth, and false, and the people who know this most clearly are the residents of the fractionated, warring, ethnically divided &#8220;Third World&#8221;; you know, the same people who will do anything to get to the USA where of course they then claim we should celebrate multiculturalism and warmly and expensively welcome them. To do what when they get here? Of course, fractionate and form enclaves where they will feel comfortable, and can speak their language, and perhaps laugh at the stupidity of the people who let them in.<br>
So, then, you ask how can the Democrats keep claiming, apparently correctly, theirs is the party of the immigrant? It is the party of the immigrant, but once they have arrived do they want more of their fellow Third Worlders, in the millions, to be here and to compete with them for what remains of American largesse and bounty? Guess again.<br>
America is the country of the enclave and will be so for many generations to come. Of course this will be the subject of media derision when whites circle their wagons; mocking &#8220;Whitopias&#8221; is a common theme. But it is a one-note song and tires intelligent listeners pretty quickly when the complete lack of irony becomes apparent.<br>
My solution is to shut them out of your consciousness and act as if they don&rsquo;t exist. Don&rsquo;t visit their restaurants, don&rsquo;t tour their ugly countries and draw Muhammed daily.</p>

		<p>I think the White House should be rebuilt into the form of a gigantic Mosque.  This way Muslims would not have to desecrate the 9/11 site and Obama could celebrate Ramadan with his Muslim buddies all year long without ever leaving the grounds.  The official Ramadan celebration could include anti-American anti-white hate speeches by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright,  how to destroy American culture by William Ayers, the best ways to collapse the American economy by George Soros, and the most effective and efficient ways of killing white crackers and white cracker babies by King Samir Shabazz. These are just a few of the guest speakers that would fit right in with the Obama agenda.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Correct, Jody.  And Islam has never been part of British history or  culture either. </p>
<p>Although there are large numbers of Moslems in Britain today, their settlement in Britain is entirely a very modern development, which has NOTHING to do with British history or culture.</p>
<p>But in another generation of historical revision they will be saying (as the blacks are already) that blacks came to Britain with the Romans, that blacks have ALWAYS been part of the British scene. Don&rsquo;t be surprised to learn about the (hitherto unknown) Moslem advisors who helped Queen Elizabeth to fend off the Spanish Armada and make England a great sea power. Don&rsquo;t be surprised to start learning about the tremendous contributions that blacks and Moslems have made to British culture.</p>
<p>After all, Britain (like America) was built by the sweat of blacks and Moslems, don&rsquo;t you know?  All of this information has previously been suppressed because of racism.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;And here in the United States, Ramadan is a reminder that Islam has always been part of America and that American Muslims have made extraordinary contributions to our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, really? Could you please provide an example, Mr. President?</p>
<p>When I read that I was initially left puzzled and confused. This quickly tranformed into heavy disgust and uncomfortable stomache pains. I don&rsquo;t believe there were any Muslims at all in this country until the late 1800&rsquo;s, when a few blocks of Manhattan became a predominately Turkish and Syrian Arab neighborhood. Muslim &#8220;Americans&#8221; CERTAINLY did not make a single contribution to anything until very recently, for sure. The only thing an American Muslim has ever doen, that I can think of, that can be considered a &#8220;contribution&#8221; of any sort, is when that Muslim lady from Michigan become Miss America (or, as I like to call her, Miss Arabica).</p>
