<h1>10-Year-Old, Two Half-Brothers Charged in Robbery Try</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Sullivan, Seattle Times, August 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 10-year-old boy, who has been investigated numerous times by Seattle police since he was 8, was charged Friday in connection with a botched robbery aboard a Metro bus and an unrelated theft of a bicycle in June.</p>
<p>The boy and his two half-brothers, ages 12 and 14, were charged in King County Superior Court with first-degree attempted robbery in connection with Tuesday&rsquo;s incident aboard the bus, in which the younger boy accidentally shot himself in the arm during a scuffle. The 10-year-old also was charged with second-degree robbery and intimidating a witness in connection with the theft of a bicycle June 24 in downtown Seattle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the 10-year-old has been investigated 13 times for crimes that include theft, robbery with assault and robberies with a weapon, according to police. {snip}</p>
<p>Police say the three boys belong to the Down With The Crew gang in Seattle&rsquo;s Rainier Valley.</p>
<p>According to Seattle police, the 10-year-old and his half-brothers confronted a 17-year-old boy on Metro&rsquo;s Route 7 shortly before 8 p.m. Tuesday. The 10-year-old ordered the older boy to empty his pockets while his half-brothers surrounded the victim, police said.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old told police the 10-year-old unzipped the older boy&rsquo;s backpack and reached inside, where he carried a .22-caliber semi-automatic handgun. The 17-year-old later told police he was afraid the younger boy was reaching for the gun.</p>
<p>The older boy grabbed the 10-year-old in a bear hug, and during the struggle a gunshot went off inside the backpack, wounding the younger boy in the arm, police said.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old was not arrested, and prosecutors say no decision has been made on whether he will be charged for having the handgun.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old and two other boys  &mdash;  not his half-brothers  &mdash;  also are accused of stealing bicycles from a group of youths outside the Levi&rsquo;s Store in downtown Seattle on June 24.</p>
<p>According to police, the three boys told the victims they could have their bikes back only if they went into the nearby Macy&rsquo;s store and stole some polo shirts, charging papers said.</p>
<p>When the victims refused, they were told that if they did not steal the shirts they would be beaten up, charges said. {snip}</p>
<p>The victims notified Macy&rsquo;s store security, and Seattle police were called. The three suspects were arrested. In addition to the 10-year-old, the other two boys, ages 13 and 11, also have been charged with second-degree robbery and witness intimidation, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Details of the 10-year-old&rsquo;s remaining five cases referred to prosecutors have not been released by authorities. {snip}</p>
<p>Though the boy has been charged for the incident on the bus, there will be a special hearing to determine whether he will stand trial in that case as well as for the June robbery.</p>
<p>According to state law, children between the ages of 9 and 11 &#8220;are presumed to be incapable of committing crime&#8221; unless a judge determines the youth has the &#8220;sufficient capacity to understand the act or neglect, and to know that it was wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Right. When these juvenile &#8220;justice&#8221; laws were written, NO ONE ever conceived of a situation where a &#8220;child&#8221; that young would even perpetrate crimes of this magnitude, much less do so with intent and malice. </p>
<p>What was once only read about in Ripley&rsquo;s Believe It or NOT and maybe not believed is nowadays not common, but not that rare!</p>

		<p>Never a word about the DNA donors for these &#8220;honor roll&#8221; students   &mdash;   they should be held equally responsible for their behavior.  This is one of the reasons why I want draconian welfare reform   &mdash;   not a dime for children born after a recipient is in the program.  We need to stop paying these people to breed!!!</p>

		<p>Is there any proof the child was black (or other non-white)? If not, I don&rsquo;t think it has a place on amren. Whilst supporters may think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that it was a black child, others may see this as an opportunity to attack the site&rsquo;s integrity, including accusing (rightfully I might add) the site jumping to conclusions. After all it isn&rsquo;t hard to twist the story&rsquo;s appearance on the site against this site. Maybe other stories could be found? Given the beliefs this site holds about black people, more disturbing/stupid crimes shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to come by.</p>

		<p>Well, here is another case where society(White people) have once again failed.  We made that poor 10-year old lad what he is today.  A product no doubt of poor schooling and a single mom who has had to depend upon the charity of the tax paying citizens to feed her brood.  No time to bring them up right.  Maybe the kids were hungry and that&rsquo;s why they decided to rob the 17 year old boy. Hey, every ten year old boy should have a bike.  Share the wealth.  See some kids with bikes, just take&rsquo;em.  (I wonder what race the victims were?)  Hmmmmm, I&rsquo;d take a guess and say &#8216;White&rsquo; for sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame the seventeen year old for carrying a piece.  We&rsquo;ve had over 300 shootings here in Chicago last month alone.  Two coppers killed.</p>

		<p>Does anyone notice the confusing syntax in this article? </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s deliberate or the writer is just an idiot. But in one sentence, the 17 year old victim is described as &#8220;the older boy&#8221; and in the next sentence the perpetrator is described as &#8220;the older boy&#8221;. </p>
<p>How are we supposed have a clue what&rsquo;s going on?</p>

<p>Um&hellip;a belief is something you feel without evidence.  It&rsquo;s an assumption.  We don&rsquo;t &#8216;believe&rsquo; these negative things about blacks.    We speak from personal experience.  We look at statistics.  Just because feel-good people like are abhorred and offended by our views doesn&rsquo;t mean we are ignorant or wrong.  We live on a place called Earth.  Where do you live?</p>

		<p>Reference the comments of Poster #5 ( Rational Thinker):  The local TV media has shown time and time again video of the child&rsquo;s(?) arm and the color is black certainly not white.  Seattle/Tacoma has a bad race problem with blacks that the city and county leaders try to hide.  Blacks cruise the streets in cars and on foot looking for trouble and this problem seems to have gotten worse since the last presidential election.  Fence building on private property has expanded greatly in Western Washington along with installation of home alarms.                         </p>

		<p>Anon #5 - This story about a murdered black 16-year old &#8220;affiliated&#8221; with Down With the Crew suggests that the subjects of this story were indeed black.</p>

		<p>In response to &#8216;Rational Thinker&rsquo;, no, there is no proof in the news stories of the race of the boys; their age makes it impossible to name them, and if they were over 18, their racial identity would probably be obscured by the &#8216;news&rsquo; media.</p>
<p>But it can be inferred that they are likely black because of the gang they are involved with, Down With Crew. Most if not all of the urban gangs are ethnically/racially based, and this is true in Seattle as much as in other areas.</p>
<p>As for this site being &#8216;discredited&rsquo; because of posters&rsquo; jumping to conclusions, I think that the Politically Correct can and will condemn sites like this one simply because of the pro-White viewpoint, which is not allowed. To worry about what those who already condemn us are going to say or think is rather pointless.</p>

<p>Yes, there have been pictures of his hands on the news (handcuffed at his court appearance).  He&rsquo;s a dark skinned black.  </p>
<p>Besides, did you really think anything other than &#8220;black&#8221; when you first read this headline?  There is a reason we all correctly guessed his race - headlines like these are 95% black-caused (although they&rsquo;re only 13% of the population).  Even liberals heard the word &#8220;black&#8221; in their heads upon picking up the paper&hellip;then spent the rest of the day feeling guilty for their shameful inner racism.  </p>
