<h1>Some 200 Women Gang-Raped Near Congo UN Base</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Faul, Google News, August 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rwandan and Congolese rebels gang-raped nearly 200 women and some baby boys over four days within miles of a U.N. peacekeepers&rsquo; base in an eastern Congo mining district, an American aid worker and a Congolese doctor said Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At U.N. headquarters in New York, spokesman Martin Nesirky said Monday that a U.N. Joint Human Rights team verified allegations of the rape of at least 154 women by combatants from the Rwandan rebel FDLR group and Congolese Mai-Mai rebels in the village of Bunangiri. He said the victims are receiving medical and psycho-social care.</p>
<p>Nesirky said the U.N. peacekeeping mission has a military company operating base in Kibua, some 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) east of the village, but he said FDLR attackers blocked the road and prevented villagers from reaching the nearest communication point.</p>
<p>Civil society leader Charles Masudi Kisa said there were only about 25 peacekeepers and that they did what they could against some 200 to 400 rebels who occupied the town of about 2,200 people and five nearby villages.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the peacekeepers approached a village, the rebels would run into the forest, but then the Blue Helmets had to move on to another area, and the rebels would just return,&#8221; Masudi said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Four young boys also were raped, said Dr. Kasimbo Charles Kacha, the district medical chief. Masudi said they were babies aged one month, six months, a year and 18 months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Survivors said their attackers were from the FDLR that includes perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide who fled across the border to Congo in 1994 and have been terrorizing the population in eastern Congo ever since, according to Cragin. The Rwandans were accompanied by Mai-Mai rebels, he said, quoting survivors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rape as a weapon of war has become shockingly commonplace in eastern Congo, where at least 8,300 rapes were reported last year, according to the United Nations. It is believed that many more rapes go unreported.</p>

I find it odd that people will write about how horrifying it is that blacks rape 200 women and four baby boys but no one seems to interested in talking about the 90,000 White women in S. Africa that blacks rape, let alone all the savage murders they commit against Whites there. How about the 30,000 or so a year they rape in the USA?</p>
<p><br>
I guess when Whites are the victims of blacks no one gives a darn. The media sure doesn&rsquo;t. </p>

And in other news, a black women working for the US Dept of Agriculture was wrongly accused of racism. The story was repeated, debated, and denounced for weeks.</p>
<p>Blaak Obongo: I agree. When it comes to blacks and muslims (particular muslim (mis)treatment of women), the feminists are silent. It seems as long as a woman is paid the same as a man, a woman doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Pay equity, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.<br>

		<p>In answer to Blaak Obongo: The National Violence Against Women Survey:Acts of sexual violence against women since the age of 18: 100% of rapes,92% of physical assaults and 97% of stalking acts were perpetrated by men. Sexual violence against men is also mainly perpetrated by men:70% of rapes,86% of physical assaults and 65% of stalking acts.</p>
<p>With those kind of stats in this country alone, do you really think it&rsquo;s possible to keep those poor Congolese women safe in that third world country? Yeah right. </p>

		<p>&#8220;A Feminist&#8221; completely dodged the issue with irrelevant statistics and a straw-man insistence that it&rsquo;s impossible to &#8220;keep these poor Congolese women safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one is suggesting that we can or should charge into the Congo to &#8220;keep them safe.&#8221;  Nor was anyone suggesting that the majority of rapes anywhere are not committed by men.  I&rsquo;m asking <i>where is the public feminist outrage</i> over these <i>100% black</i> rape atrocities.</p>
<p>And while you&rsquo;re at it, what percentage of the &#8220;men&#8221; in your rape statistics are black?  Do you know?  Do you care?  </p>
<p>The point of the article was that blacks are behaving in a clearly bad manner.  My own point was that none of the feminists who claim to be so disturbed by rape are even interested in calling attention to it.  Like yourself, they are satisfied to growl at &#8220;men&#8221; as a group, and ignore the racial component altogether.<br>

		<p>When they&rsquo;re in their countries, I simply no longer have the energy to care what happens or what they do. Yes, I know behavior in many countries and continents is vile and horrendous and I despise it. When they bring it to MINE, especially when encouraged, fostered and protected is when I voice my outrage. I don&rsquo;t have much power here, but I have none- and little interest - outside my borders any longer.</p>

		<p>The end of European colonialism in sub Saharan Africa was unfortunate.  Many European imperialists were predatory when and soon after they conquered Africa.  By the 1950s and 1960s they had evolved morally the benevolent paternalism most black Africans seem to benefit from.  </p>

In the mid-80s the price of tantal skyrocketed over tenfold, and that´s when the troubles in the region started (meaning North and South Kivu and neighboring Rwanda and Burundi). Before, it had been of interest only for surgical steels and certain hard metals, but they discovered they could make much smaller and lighter capacitors from it. For reasons I will not bore you with, the ore there is much richer (about 100 times the worldwide average).<br>
As a result, if you have 25 yoofs with guns you are a mining entrepreneur.<br>
It is sad that mineral wealth should have such consequences instead of lifting up what used to be a backwater - but think of the history of US gold rushes for comparison.</p>

		<p>Why is it the pseudo-intellectuals do not seek out the facts about black Africans and their ways.  Having lived in Africa for 23 years, when I opine my experiences fools here think I am a racist and call me so.  The black Africans must be kept out of the West at all costs for maybe 100 years until they become civilised up to our standards.</p>
<p>Blacks in Africa have been raping babies since they were told it cures HIV-AIDS and that is about 10 years now, but not in the old South Africa.  Paint a woman on a door with a knot hole in it and it will get raped.</p>

		<p>In WW1 there was a general mutiny in the French trenches.  It came from the blind abuse of the French soldiery by the out of touch general staff who flatly believed and stated that the French soldier would win by his superior courage.  So they wasted millions, feeding them into machine gun fields with no tactical plan attached.  When this mutiny took place, a large contingent of African troops took part, not just striking on the line, but retreating from the line and never fired one shot, having just arrived. When they poured into the field camps, they attacked the hospitals, raped the nurses en masse and wrecked encampments, killing unntold convalescents.  This is included in any detailed history on The Great War.  However, I recently saw a history channel version that made it sound like White French troops did it, and never mentions the Black troops. </p>

		<p>In answer to Blaak Obongo: I have a hard time finding statistics on sexual violence in this country broken down by race. Oh, what a shock! And no, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to be a feminist to be disturbed by sexual violence. Just a decent individual. Which is becoming a lot harder to find in this country, I&rsquo;m sure, due in large part, to the invading hoards who view women and children as property, coming from lawless countries as they do. Those cowardly men who hide behind religion or what ever excuse to inflict harm and injury should just stay in their own countries. We have enough home grown sociopaths here. But a jewel is a REAL man who does not think or act that way. A lot of men fought and died for this country which is how we women in America are able to live as freely as we do, in a much better situation than other women the world over. And to them I am truly grateful. So no, I don&rsquo;t &#8220;growl&#8221; at men. But I will always stand up for myself. Because I am just as good as a man.<br>

<p>Where were they when those things were handed out?</p>
<p>&#8220;A Feminist&#8221; is silent on the matter of Bantu-on-Bantu rape because it&rsquo;s not Caucasian men who are raping, but black Mau Mau types, who are doing it. This flies in the face of everything &#8216;A Feminist&#8221; has been indoctrinated about. Only White men rape, Bantu men and others are merely having &#8220;rough sex&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I find it interesting to note that liberal feminists ignore these sort of things,I can only suppose because it would upset their idea of the &#8220;white devil&#8221;.If one looks at interracial sexual assault it is almost exclusively black on white,John Grisham notwithstanding.Colonialism did a great service for the Africans and they were better for it.Witness Sierra Leone where a white led Private Military Company with 125 men shut down a blood soaked orgy of rape and murder in days.When they were forced to leave by the UN and the World Bank,hostilities recommenced.Let us not forget that these mind numbing reports of horrible violence do not in fact constitute war.They are banditry nothing more and business as usual on the dark continent where the bizarre and horrible is a daily occurrence.Some of the comments remind me of an article a woman wrote after allegedly being raped(We are Women Not Weapons of War)on a rooftop in Haiti.The crux of the article was that whitey was more to blame than the black man that attacked her while she was asleep.How that works I have no idea.</p>

		<p>If you read the original article it has a link that has related stories informing us that our Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is &#8220;deeply troubled&#8221; by this. Well thank God she weighed in with that damning opinion! Seriously, this world is half-way downstream when a story like this hits the wire and our political leaders can only muster up a catch phrase of deeply troubled??? </p>
<p>No matter the country, no matter the race, 200 plus rapes including babies is an abomination. Should we commit troops? No. Should we send taxpayers dollars? No. However, what we should do as country is have alittle more condemnation than &#8220;deeply troubled.&#8221; As many have posted already all this country needs is the whiff of racism or supposed unfairness and the media will run with the story all week(or months) long. How pathetic and low this country has fallen when the leading story is another supposed race slight verses this barbaric action. </p>

		<p>Rapes in the Congo by &#8220;rebels&#8221; are frequently done with gun barrels, bayonets or other blunt instruments. Many of the unfortunate women gang raped by the militias/rebels develop fistula &mdash; a medical condition where the wall between the bladder and vagina are destroyed. Fistula leads to both incontinence and sterility. This certainly adds an extra dimension of horror to the already dastardly and ugly crime of rape. See the excellent documentary called &#8220;Lumo&#8221; for some of unfortunate survivor&rsquo;s stories.</p>
