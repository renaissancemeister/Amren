<h1><a href="https://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/22/local/la-me-refugee-assistance-20100823">Elderly and Disabled Immigrants May Lose Financial Aid</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexandra Zavis, Los Angeles Times, August 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some of the poorest elderly and disabled people admitted to this country on humanitarian grounds will lose their cash assistance in October unless they have naturalization applications pending, federal officials say.</p>
<p>Letters have been sent to 3,800 recipients of Supplemental Security Income, including some in California, warning them that their eligibility for the federal program could end Sept. 30, said Lowell Kepke, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration.</p>
<p>The deadline has caused concern among refugee advocates, who point out that some of these legal immigrants aren&rsquo;t able to pass the citizenship exam or can&rsquo;t yet apply because of delays processing their green cards.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most immigrants are required to show that they have a job, family or other means of support in the U.S., but that is not the case for people admitted through humanitarian programs. They were once offered unrestricted access to the Supplemental Security Income program, which provides monthly checks to elderly, blind and disabled people with little or no income.</p>
<p>That access was reduced to seven years when Congress decided in 1996 to require citizenship for many federal benefits. Supporters of the change argued that it would encourage humanitarian immigrants to become citizens.</p>
<p>A two-year extension was approved with bipartisan support in 2008 for those who had already been in the country seven years without becoming citizens. They can receive one more year of benefits if they have an application pending or are waiting to take the oath of citizenship, Kepke said.</p>

		<p>For years elderly immigrants, who never paid a dime in taxes, have been collecting SSI, Medicaid and Food Stamps, who have sons and daughters who are employed as doctors and engineers here in the US who should be supporting them!  Let them go home.  8 or 80 I am tired of taking care of them!</p>

		<p>Why are US Tax dollars supporting non citizens? And why should we allow citizenship just so someone can go on the dole? </p>
<p>The system is broken. We need a full moratorium on all immigration. Illegals should be deported. Anchor babies should be stripped of their ill-gotten citizenship and deported. Legal immigrants who commit crimes should be stripped of their citizenship and deported. American safety and security comes first. It&rsquo;s high time we stop allowing others to dictate US policies.</p>

		<p>Send them all home. Then send those who brought them here back to live with and support these &#8220;refugees&#8221;. Next go after the Congress Reps who okay&rsquo;d this in the first place! I know of many Hmong refugees that came here and then brought in all their elderly parents and took them down to Social Security asap to sign up for their &#8220;benefits&#8221;. In fact, I know for certain that an elderly man and wife(refugee) together draw darn good BENEFITS and who NEVER ever worked and paid a dime into our system. They only come to TAKE, never give.</p>

		<p>This is one of the scandalous things in America few know about: elderly parents of immigrants living off the public dole. There are entire books written in Chinese telling how to get to America and file for SSI. I personally know of parents of an Armenian family that have been getting $2,000 a month (tax free) for many, many years now. When they came, their son was supposed to be supporting them, but they knew how to game the system. They have never contributed one red cent to the public coffers, but take everything. They get food stamps, free medical care, and every kind of public assistance possible, including subsidized utility bills.</p>
<p>They are getting far more money than I will ever recieve in Social Security when I retire, and I think our country is beyond redemption when they allow such people to leech off the system. One more thing, they keep their nice apt. in Moscow (now worth several hundred thousand $$) and constantly bitch about how bad the US is. It&rsquo;s nauseating when you know people like this personally and see it in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sick, it&rsquo;s sad, and there&rsquo;s not a thing we can do about it. </p>

		<p>Sitting in the SSA office one day, an elderly Muslim couple came in with their son. She could barely walk or stand. The 50ish son was dressed VERY nice. I saw many elderly NONwhites in that office and most not speaking English of course. Many Asians and Mexicans. These people never paid a dime into our system or paid any sort of taxes throughout their lives. It really hit me hard when I found out the small amount I would be getting after working for 40 years and paying into that system, worrying how I was going to live and pay the bills the rest of my days.</p>
<p> Walking out the door, I saw the elderly Muslim couple get into their sons car and you guessed it, a Lexus. I slowly walked to my 12 year old car and looked around at all these foreigners and felt like an outcast and stranger in my own country. When they talk about social security going broke we NEVER hear about who is really milking the system (besides our government), do we?</p>

		<p>The Mennonite church was really bad for bringing in indigent aliens for a while until people in this area pretty much got fed up and threatened cutting business ties with them and they suddenly got the message. Anyone who brings in these leeches should be held financially accountable for the maintence and care of their charges &#8220;forever and ever amen&#8221;. That would end this foolishness quickly.</p>

		<p>Is there any way to find out what foreign elderly folks are bleeding us dry? Has anyone heard of a FOIA request for this sort of information? I realize that names may need to be redacted, but is the summary information available? </p>

		<p><i>Carey said some people had tried repeatedly to pass the citizenship exam, but were too elderly or traumatized to learn English. They include some of the Vietnamese people who fought alongside Americans in the Vietnam War and were held for years in &#8220;re-education camps.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>Ha!  They&rsquo;re pulling out the stops here.  The utter contempt (deserved, really) that the media has for Joe Freepin Sixpack.   &#8220;Why, they fought for &#8216;Merica!  Denying them bennies is just like steppin&rsquo; on Ole Glory!&#8221;  Even Freepers probably wouldn&rsquo;t fall for it in this case, though.  Still it&rsquo;s a classic example of how the left uses utterly shameless but generally successful appeals to the patriotic pride or vanity of conservatives as a weapon to destroy them.    Mr. Liberal: &#8220;These foreigners only want to live the American Dream,  isn&rsquo;t the American Dream wonderful,  you do believe in the American Dream, don&rsquo;t you?  Being against mass immigration is like being against the American Dream!  It&rsquo;s unAmerican!&#8221;   J.F.S.:  &#8220;Uh, uh, uh, I&rsquo;m only against ILLEGAL immigration!&#8221;</p>
