<h1><a href="http://grandrants.wordpress.com/2010/08/27/heirloom-diseases/">Heirloom Diseases</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"Stoutcat," Grand Rants, August 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
</blockquote>Typhoid, leprosy, tuberculosis, scarlet fever, bed bugs. All thought to be afflictions of previous generations, rendered harmless by better sanitation, better technology, better medical treatment. All alive and well here in America. Why?
<p>There are many reasons for the resurgence of these diseases, but I believe one main factor has facilitated this deadly resurgence: open borders, which let in more than just illegal aliens. They also allow in the third-world diseases that some border-crossers carry. Close the borders, and you begin to control the diseases that piggyback in with the illegals.</p>
<p>This seems to be a microcosm of our national outlook  &mdash;  our government is not making the hard decisions, it&rsquo;s making the politically correct ones. And until we change that, we&rsquo;d all better get accustomed to bedbugs and the occasional outbreak of a long-forgotten heirloom disease.<br>

		<p>Just a short 30 years ago, when the USA was still overwhelmingly White, we had virtually eliminated all of these maladies.  All of these alien diseases and pests begin to reappear in America after the beginning of massive immigration from the Third World. </p>

<p>as the hordes of descendants from the Mayans, Aztecs, Inca&rsquo;s and many other tribes from south of the border stream across our borders, they bring lots of stuff&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..  when it becomes a news item, you notice for a minute, but this is in every community where the hordes settle.  Yes, in your town too.</p>

		<p>I am sure the Government will put a far more positive spin on this development. After all, using hard earned taxpayer money to threat those diseases that were nearly eradicated in America will &#8220;help the economy&#8221;. </p>

		<p>One of the biggest reasons immigrants used to have to come into this country legally through Ellis Island was to not introduce the diseases mentioned in this article. Of course now they publish articles of how they&rsquo;re making a comeback because they no longer can hide the obvious. But TB has been wide spread in America&rsquo;s jail populations since President Jimmy Carter was in office. You didn&rsquo;t hear about it, they were able to keep it quiet. And in a show on Discovery Health they featured a parasite that invades the brain that is passed from hand to food contact from infected people who do not wash their hands after a BM. A teenage boy had this in California and it took the doctors a while to figure out that it was a parasite transmitted by their Hispanic helper in their kitchen. Since this population lives with this in their bodies, they are immune to the harsher effects. Before they could tell her, she had left their employ but the CDC could follow her trek north in America due to her spreading this parasite. With the way this country likes to keep us in the dark I&rsquo;m amazed but glad they let Dis.Health channel show this. But other than this I have never read or heard anything about it since.</p>

		<p>Of course these infestations and diseases all have to do with third-world immigration, and the elites know it!  Some probably believe that, by staying far from the great unwashed, they can avoid the scourges.  But even those who acknowledge to themselves that their Guatamalan maid may be carrying bedbugs in her clothing cannot bring themselves to admit the same to the nation at large.  If poor, migratory white hillbillies were causing the problem, the elites would be howling that such people had to be either banned from upscale urban areas or swept up into paddy wagons to be disinfected at huge camps.  But the ivory-tower liberals have strapped themselves into a mindset in which any whiff of suspicion against a non-white would be (gasp!) RACIST.</p>

		<p>I stayed in a building infested with bedbugs thanks to immigrants.  Terrible experience.  They should all be screened before being allowed into the country.  The usa has become an open air insane asylum/flophouse for all the world.</p>

		<p>Immigration is a public health issue, as this commentary demonstrates. </p>
<p>But not to worry!  With Obama&rsquo;s health care plan, we&rsquo;ll all be able to get the care we need when we start coming down with once-obscure contagious diseases! (Sarcasm intended.)</p>

		<p>We also banned DDT. Bad idea. Look for malaria outbreaks in the South - it used to kill/torture God only knows how many people down here prior to the widespread use of DDT.</p>
<p>And now doctors/biochemists are creating more and more wonderful products to kill off the natural flora within our intestinal tract, leaving us subject to infection by the so-called superbugs. Every thing we have in us was there for a reason and usually that reason is to keep us alive.</p>

		<p>All true.  But this is the price you pay for a &#8220;gorgeous mosaic,&#8221;<br>
a phrase coined by former washroom attendant (AKA mayor of New York) David Dinkins to refer approvingly to the results of mass immigration.</p>
<p> But cooties in the skin, brains and lungs are the least of the pestilences these people bring to us.  Their criminality, second grade educations, and acquiescence with third world kleptocracies will do us much more harm.</p>

That is SO, SO true!  That is the ideology of the committed Diversitarian in a nutshell. And, to such a person, ANYTHING is worth the attainment of that wonderful, utopian goal. It&rsquo;s their pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the fulfillment of their lifelong dream,  and ANY sacrifice is worth making.</p>
<p>(Too bad, if YOU just happen to be the sacrifice.)</p>
