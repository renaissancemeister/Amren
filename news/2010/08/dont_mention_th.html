			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Wilkes, Daily Mail (London), August 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For Basil Fawlty, it would have been the final straw. Britain&rsquo;s most hopeless hotelier, who failed so miserably to avoid mentioning the war to his German guests, would have apoplexy confronted by the latest demands of tourism chiefs.</p>
<p>A catalogue of obscure and demanding dos and don&rsquo;ts to be observed when dealing with foreign visitors is issued to the hopitality industry today by VisitBritain, the national tourism agency.</p>
<p>As far as war is concerned, it&rsquo;s the Mexicans that they should avoid raising the subject with  &mdash;  in this case, the bloody 1846-48 conflict with the U.S.</p>
<p>You should never pour wine back-handed for an Argentinian, the guide says, as this indicates hostility.</p>
<p>Similarly, people from Hong Kong often consider winking to be rude rather than friendly or flirtatious.</p>
<p>VisitBritain hopes workers, from cab drivers to hotel managers, will master the cultural tips in time for the 2012 Olympics to ensure overseas visitors receive the warmest possible welcome  &mdash;  and unfortunate misunderstandings that could cause offence are avoided.</p>
<p>The guide, Delivering a First Class Welcome, was written by natives of the countries featured who work for VisitBritain. But it doesn&rsquo;t mention the war in its section on German tourists.</p>
<p>Instead, it advises that they &#8216;love &#8220;insider information&#8221; such as tips on events, pubs, restaurants.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. things that aren&rsquo;t necessarily found in a travel guide&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Britain comes 14th out of 50 in the Nation Brands Index for the quality of welcome would-be visitors believe they will get.</p>
<p>Sandie Dawe, VisitBritain&rsquo;s chief executive, said: &#8216;Overseas visitors spend more than Â£16billion a year in Britain, contributing massively to our economy and supporting jobs across the country. So giving our foreign visitors a friendly welcome is absolutely vital.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fawlty, the Torquay hotelier played by John Cleese in Fawlty Towers, tells his staff &#8216;Don&rsquo;t mention the war&rsquo; when a group of Germans come to stay. But he then takes their order as &#8216;two egg mayonnaise, a prawn Goebbels, a Hermann Goering and four Colditz salads&rsquo;.<br>

<p><b>Your Checklist of Behaviour Likely to Offend a Foreigner <br>
<small> The advice to those in the hospitality industry includes:</small></b></p>
<p>MEXICO</p>
<p>It is best not to discuss poverty, illegal immigrants, earthquakes or the Mexican-American war of 1846-48. The U.S. had annexed Texas, which Mexico considered part of its territory. Mexico lost.</p>
<p>HONG KONG</p>
<p>Avoid winking  &mdash;  it is often considered rude. Pointing with an index finger is not advisable as this is generally used only for animals. Point with your hand open.</p>
<p>INDIA</p>
<p>Avoid physical contact when first meeting someone. Be tolerant if Indians at first seem impolite, noisy and impatient. This is partly the result of living in chaotic cities and environments.</p>
<p>BELGIUM</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t snap your fingers as it could be interpreted as impolite.</p>
<p>ARGENTINA</p>
<p>Pouring wine backwards into a glass indicates hostility. Don&rsquo;t be offended by Argentinian humour, which may mildly attack your clothing or weight.</p>
<p>CHINA</p>
<p>Avoid saying &#8216;thank you&rsquo; to a compliment. Instead, politely deny it to show humility. If you compliment a Chinese person, expect a denial.</p>
<p>JAPAN</p>
<p>A smiling Japanese person is not necessarily happy. They tend to smile when angry, embarrassed, sad or disappointed.</p>
<p>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</p>
<p>Arabs are not used to being told what to do. Visitors from the UAE can take great offence if you appear bossy. They appreciate being looked after by staff who understand Arab culture.</p>
<p>SOUTH AFRICA</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed if South Africans say they were held up by &#8216;robots&rsquo;  &mdash;  to them it means traffic lights. Don&rsquo;t place your thumb between your forefinger and second finger, as it&rsquo;s seen as obscene.</p>
<p>BRAZIL</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask a Brazilian personal questions, especially about age, salary or marriage. And don&rsquo;t talk about Argentina  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s Brazil&rsquo;s fiercest sporting rival, especially in football.</p>
<p>SOUTH KOREA</p>
<p>When accepting thanks Koreans will typically say &#8216;No, no&rsquo;. This means &#8216;You are welcome&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to politically correct, but I&rsquo;m always bothered by the incorrect and continued usage of &#8220;Chinaman&#8221;. It&rsquo;s Chinese man. You wouldn&rsquo;t say Franceman or Englandman. The term &#8220;Chinaman&#8221; is archaic and derived from the broken English of Chinese immigrants. </p>

<p>My sentiments exactly.  No one is worried the least little bit about offending Americans or British.  That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re mostly White racists anyway.</p>

		<p>Its pointless to have such guidelines. Most tourists or foreign visitors expect something different when they visit another country and read up on their destination before setting off. After all they go to Britain to experience another country, and are braced and even enjoy the prospect of customs and habits not familiar to them. Why deny them such an experience?</p>
<p>Some observations on the sidebar though&hellip;<br>
The Belgians consider snapping your fingers rude? That applies almost everywhere.<br>
Hong Kong has been singled out for finding winking vulgar. But in many Southern European countries (Italy comes to mind), the taboo also applies.<br>
What can be said for one East Asian country on this list can be said for all. Thus in Japan it is expected that compliments are denied, and pointing with a finger and winking are rude, as well as the smiling while angry habit.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I disagree.  I think you are trying to be  overly Politically Correct, even if inadvertently.   You certainly WOULD say a Dutchman, an Irishman, a Welshman,  or a Frenchman (and so would I)&hellip; and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Neither is there anything wrong with Chinaman - except in the ear of an overly sensitive &#8216;beholder&rsquo; - if that person is on the alert and looking for slights.  We have become just too touchy as of late; and there is no sane justification for seeking insults where there are none. </p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s somewhat antiquated, but not necessarily  pejorative. Nor did it come from the &#8220;broken English of Chinese immigrants&#8221;.  In past centuries, even even a Japanese was often known as a &#8220;Japan man&#8221; when they were still very rare and people had a hard time finding the right word.  Personally, I find &#8220;Chinaman&#8221; more precise because &#8220;Chinese&#8221; can refer just as well to the language or culture as  to the people or a person. </p>

		<p>As Rational Thinker has said,  &#8220;Most foreign visitors expect something different when they visit another country, and  [they]read up on their destination before setting off. After all, they go to [another country] to experience its customs and habits.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that I would add that it is not the obligation of the country visited to change or taylor its behavior to suit its visitor(s), but rather the reverse. If those visitors can&rsquo;t deal with &#8220;strange&#8221; foreign behavior and customs, then they would would do best to stay at home where they will be most comfortable.</p>
<p>We have become much too concerned with fawning over foreigners! (Especially if they are non-western and non-white.) Incidentally, I write this as an American presently in a foreign country myself. I am fully willing to accept their laws and customs, and I expect no special favors,  so I am not being a hypocrite. That&rsquo;s the price you pay for being in someone else&rsquo;s home. It&rsquo;s entirely reasonable.</p>

<p>This is a complete upending of a wise piece of advice that we all grew up with: &#8220;When in Rome, do as the Romans do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, apparently, the advice is, &#8220;When in Rome, force the Romans to do as you do. And if the Romans resist in any way, then scream and cry and stomp your feet and accuse them of racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a (say) Korean is visiting England, it is not the responsibility of the English hosts to keep in mind that Koreans find finger-pointing rude. It is the responsibility of the Korean visitor to keep in mind that the English do NOT find finger-pointing rude. </p>

		<p>For those who wrote that the article didn&rsquo;t seem concerned about offending Americans, you&rsquo;re more right than you realize - only not in the <i>way</i> that you realize. There actually was a brief summary on Americans&hellip;</p>
<p><i>Americans can appear &#8220;informal to the point of being very direct or even rude&#8221; and won&rsquo;t ever hesitate about complaining, the guide says</i></p>
<p>If their goal was to give guidelines on how <i>not</i> to offend people then they missed by a mile.</p>

		<p>Well I don&rsquo;t call them Chinamen, I call them something else&hellip; But you know something, they call you FAR worse. There are something like 30 differant slang words for whites in China, none of them complimentary. In their native language they are extremely racist.</p>

<p>Probably because there are not many actual Americans anymore, just a whole lot of crazy statists/socialists/internationalists who live here and may or may not be considered citizens. Said people gladly denounce their own nation, race, religion, culture, etc.</p>
<p>The more you listen to what people want, or will settle for, the more it will break the heart of any patriotic American who believes in the original idea of the Founders. What we have now is the complete opposite.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, no one worries about offending Americans because we are the most culturally enlightened in the world.  When a foreigner does a gaffe or something that looks silly or inappropriate to us, we are understanding and laugh it off.</p>
<p>Less developed cultures get all serious about it when someone makes a mistake to them.  That is why in the U.S. every non-white group has no qualms about moving into a white neighborhood, but among themselves, minorities don&rsquo;t prefer to live among other minorites.  (Blacks don&rsquo;t move into mexican areas of town.  Asians don&rsquo;t move into black areas of town, etc.)</p>
