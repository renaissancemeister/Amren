<h1>Did Environmentalist Back Arizona&rsquo;s SB1070?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Giblin and Kelly Virella, City Limits, August 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New York-based community groups have taken up a national campaign to fight Arizona&rsquo;s controversial anti-illegal immigration law by targeting a local foundation that they say backs groups supporting the law. About 40 protesters gathered in front of a midtown office building on 3rd Avenue last week to draw attention to ties between the Weeden Foundation, a major supporter of global land and wildlife conservation efforts, and the organizations, which the protesters consider racist, anti-immigrant hate groups. Protesters based their allegations on Apply the Brakes a report by the Chicago-based Center for New Community that explores the relationship between certain anti-immigration groups and environmentalists.</p>
<p>In 2010, Weeden made a grant to Californians for Population Stabilization, a group that supports Arizona&rsquo;s new anti-illegal immigration law, SB1070  &mdash;  a law immigration activists said threatened, before a federal judge intervened last week, to subject people of color in Arizona to racial profiling.</p>
<p>Protesters also accuse Weeden of financially supporting the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which helped craft SB1070. However, according to Weeden&rsquo;s website, Weeden hasn&rsquo;t given any grants to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), in the past ten years.</p>
<p>In 2010, Weeden also made grants to Center for Immigration Studies and NumbersUSA, groups opposed to increasing U.S. immigration.</p>
<p>Protesters said Weeden justifies its opposition to immigration by blaming immigrants for America&rsquo;s rising consumption and pollution levels. &#8220;It&rsquo;s sad that companies like BP can have a huge oil spill, ruin the environment and the focus is still on immigrants,&#8221; said protester Adama Foneh, a leader of Sistas and Brothas United (SBU), one of the organizers of the event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Weeden spokesperson said the organization&rsquo;s executive director was traveling abroad and unavailable to comment. Nor did the Center for Immigration Studies respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what we&rsquo;ve descended to in this immigration argument,&#8221; said Rick Oltman, national media director of Californians for Population Stabilization. &#8220;They cannot say mass-illegal immigration will help the country, they cannot say it will decrease crime, all they can say is that the opposition is racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Weeden was founded in 1963, according to the mission statement on its website, and &#8220;embraces the protection of biodiversity as its main priority.&#8221; It also focuses on over-consumption and over-population. On the website of an organization called Apply the Brakes, a group that advocates for a halt to &#8220;unsustainable U.S. population growth,&#8221; Don Weeden, the foundation&rsquo;s executive director, explains the connection he sees between over-consumption, over-population and immigration. &#8220;America&rsquo;s ballooning population, unique in the developed world, is largely driven by historically high immigration numbers&#8221; he says. &#8220;Prescriptions for reaching a population-environment balance need not be anti-immigrant: The U.S can still accept immigrants, just not at the current rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2010, the Weeden Foundation gave a $25,000 grant to NumbersUSA and $20,000 to Californians for Population Stabilization, according to the foundation&rsquo;s website. NumbersUSA&rsquo;s 2010 grant was their seventh consecutive annual grant from the foundation, totaling $185,000 since 2004, according to Weeden&rsquo;s website. The foundation also gave a grant  &mdash;  whose amount the website does not disclose  &mdash;  to the Center for Immigration Studies in 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greg Costello, executive director of the Oregon-based Western Environmental Law Center, another Weeden 2010 grantee, said in an email that he didn&rsquo;t know Weeden made grants focusing on immigration and human population. But now that he knows, he doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all of my dealings with the Weeden Foundation, and Don Weeden specifically, I have found the organization and the man to be highly professional, extremely well prepared and knowledgeable about the regions we were working to protect, the conservation issues involved and the nature of our work as an organization,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Based on my personal interactions I have the highest regard for the foundation and for Don. And as a private foundation they can choose to support whatever and whoever they like. We are thankful they support out work.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s protesters, comprised primarily of youth organizers from SBU and organizers from NWBCCC, two Bronx-based social justice organizations, shouted chants at the rally. A sign read, &#8220;Weeden populates the world with Hate and Racism. We are not the problem. We are the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group blocked a good portion of the sidewalk in front of the building, but the event was peaceful, with no Weeden representatives present..</p>

		<p>These New York based community groups are racist organizations that want to race-replace the Native Born White American majority with high fertility Asians,Muslims,Caribbeans,Africans and Hispanics. You can&rsquo;t get more racist than this. Of course, this New York based community group are a gang of post-1965 nonwhites who are demanding that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide within the borders of America. I mean it&rsquo;s really outrageous. What is even more outrageous is that they are urging environmental organizations to simultaneously encourage out of control population growth in the US and the race-replacement of the Native Born White American majority with post-1965 nonwhites. &#8220;Environmental&#8221; only in name. Environmentalism now means race-replacing the Native Born White American majority. </p>
<p>Folks, this is how you fight back:  direct .. get right the heart of the issue.</p>

<p>Oh, I see   &mdash;   one really nasty oil spill and now we must stop worrying and love the population bomb.  Well, Adama, the more people we have the more oil we&rsquo;re going to have to pump.</p>
<p>I am pro-environment and always have been.  I quit the Sierra Club several years ago after its leadership carried out a vicious smear campaign against a slate of pro-population stabilization, immigration reduction candidates for the board.  They even ran Morris Dees, a man who made his fortune by turning perfectly good trees into junk mail, as a fake candidate to draw votes away from the real candidates.  I realized that in most major environmental organizations today political correctness trumps any real concern for the environment.</p>

<p>Oh, I see.  A bunch of over breeding blacks and Hispanics is the solution.  Now that enforcement of immigration law is deemed to be hate, I&rsquo;m all for hate.</p>

		<p>Opposition to mass immigration is NOT RACIST! It&rsquo;s simple common sense! What&rsquo;s so hard to understand here?</p>
<p>Just suppose next month a billion Africans, another billion Asians decide to come here. Their excuse: &#8220;You had no problem allowing 30 million illegal Latinos into your country.&#8221; I mean it don&rsquo;t get no crazier! We can&rsquo;t afford to support half of Mexico along with whoever else (millions of third-worlders) who decide they want a &#8220;better life&#8221;, courtesy of the American taxpayers.</p>

<p>Since immigration is the main reason for US population growth no honest, consistent environmentalist can possibly support open-borders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agree with your last statement, but would like an explanation for your claim that the &#8220;truth&#8221; about exploding population = more pollution is &#8220;more complex&#8221; than that.  Tell us how.  </p>
<p>It is really the simplest of all statistics to compute;  Quantity vs. Quality.  When quantity exceeds certain definable limits (as has been shown in repeated lab tests of populations from bacteria, to rats, to monkeys, and even human habitation zones, over population is a finite statistic.  Over population produces many problems with overuse and ruin of natural resources at the top of the list of those things easiest to quantify.</p>
<p>I tend to view resistence to ideas like over-population and enviromental problems to a far right, Christian Conservative mindset that is just as dangerous to White Survival as those who would replace us with burgeoning populations of non-whites.  Lockstep conservatives play into the hands of big business that could care less about the color of the skin of their slaves, as long as they get the labor done cheap by manipulating the far too easy and well known political/religious triggers Christian Conservatives have embedded in their psyches.</p>
<p>Most enviromentalists are well educated whites, who having attended liberal dominated educational institutions are imprinted with beliefs and attitudes about equality and justice that are every bit as out of place as the distain that Christian Conservative so often emit apparently reflexively in a reactive fashion.  They seem to simply be the sons of those who did know about junkyards, so they parked their abandoned cars with everything else no longer useful in their front yards, and they are still smarting from the criticism of the kids whose parents knew enough to tow those cars away.  Their lifestyles were vindicated every Sunday at church because God doesn&rsquo;t appear to care about how people handle their trash.  But maybe he gave us brains so that we could figure it out.</p>
<p>It is time to step &#8220;outside the box&#8221; if you really wish to save the white race.  At some point, those of us who value things like whales and dolphins, all of the natural world, will be forced into an alliance with hopefull forward thinking conservatives in order to &#8220;Save the Whites,&#8221; and perhaps because they will finally recognize that they are on the list for immediate racial cleansing.  I think many are beginning to see this as a certainty.  There is another article about sex slavery in England on today&rsquo;s list of items on Amren.  At some point, feminists will be forced to admit that they need protection from men through their active place in families, and even a return to a more chivalric culture.  When people need eachother to survive, common sense provides the most expedient courses of action.  There is nothing wrong with such alliances since it is certain that many interests will at some point, coincide.</p>
<p>On the other hand, straining logic in order to adhere to a 19th century slash and burn mentality of utility again, is NOT going to provide an enviroment that Whites can survive in.  That just happens to be something all humans have in common.  But why would Western, educated whites want to mimick Africans who poach protected wildlife and destroy their enviroment?</p>

		<p>Something not listed surprisingly to me, is the impact on enviromentalist opinion due to the destruction of National Forests, Wild Areas, and parks due to illegal immigation camps, the use of those lands by drug producers for producing not just marijauna, but meth labs that dump their toxic waste directly into the enviroment, etc., etc.  The transient illegals in Arizona have dumped tons of waste onto the land and disrupted the habitat of many wild animals in the region.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be so skeptical, enviromentalists are beginning to see the light.  Soon, they will be looking over their own shoulders when they realize that they themselves are targeted for elimination by these same invaders and the groups that support them.</p>
<p>White Realists must make themselves flexible enough to accept new converts without insisting on lockstep mentality.  No true intellectual will ever be held by dogmatic processes.</p>

		<p>Although there are some well-intentioned (albeit naive) people involved in environmentalism, the movement is essentially a Marxist fraud.  The single greatest danger to the human race is the exploding third-world birthrate around the planet.  Only a fool would believe that whites constructing a few wind farms or solar power stations could offset the incredible strain placed on limited natural resources by the rapidly increasing third-world hordes.    </p>

		<p>To population reduction enthusiasts</p>
<p>I understand your concern. But consider this. Liberal immigration reformers and Liberal immigration reform organizations come at the issue in a nonracial way. They lecture-for at least 30 years-millions of Native Born White Americans about lowering their fertility and at the same lecture them that this has to be done so the environmental will be protected for future generations of Asian,Muslim,Hispanic and Caribbean Americans. They really do say this. It is really disgusting when you think about it. What must struggling Native Born White Americans think when they hear this nonsense from liberal immigration reformers. It surely must come across as very weird stuff.</p>
<p>You know, Native Born White Americans like babies also. But they have seen their jobs stolen by post-1969 non-whites along with wage theft and criminally high property taxes-because of Asian youth in the school systems - that reduces homeowners to renters renting from the County. Having more than two children is not economically viable. And this is a direct consequence of importing high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. I gotta tell you,I have really grown to dislike ZPG-NPG liberal immigration reformers. I am all for Native Born White Americans having lots of White babies. Expel the post-1965 nonwhites to make room the White babies. This is the really fundamental issue.</p>

<p>&#8220;More people = more pollution&#8221; is simplistic in the sense that many of the worst causes of pollution have been and will be ameliorated by white scientists and inventors. There is certainly no reason to dread an increase in white birthrates.</p>
<p>Practically every anti-&#8220;overpopulation&#8221; prophet of doom (Malthus, Erlich, Gore) has been wrong about their doomsday predictions. But they have convinced numerous whites to forego having children in a tragically misguided attempt at &#8220;saving the planet&#8221;.    </p>

<p>The Native Born White American population brought its fertility down to the ZPG level starting back in 1973-almost 40 years ago. So let&rsquo;s say this was good for the environment. However, for doing the right thing for the environment, they have been severely punished. While Native Born White Americans have brought their fertility down, Liberal Environmentalist have been cheerleaders for importing massive amounts of high fertility asians,hispanics,muslims,carribeans and africans-while at the same time stating that population growth was bad for the environment. The knew full well that Native Born White Americans had brought their fertility down to the ZPG level. In other words, they are demanding that Native Born White Amerians bear the full burden of population reduction-to the point of below replacement fertility level which would result in th racial extinction of the Native Born White Majority. Paul and Ann Ehrlich have publicly advocated this..down at an environmental conference in Washington DC a few years back. Disgusting isn&rsquo;t it. Native Born White American families should live it up and have large families. Of course,liberal immigration organizations such as numbersusa.com are openly opposed to this. </p>
