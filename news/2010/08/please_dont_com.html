<h1>Please Don&rsquo;t Come Back to New Orleans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ken Foster, Salon, August 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last October, while running an errand, I made the mistake of thinking that I could walk four blocks on a sunny Saturday afternoon in New Orleans. I was in my old Bywater neighborhood and inevitably found myself stalled by spontaneous conversation with my former neighbors; this camaraderie is what I missed about the neighborhood, but it was also why I should have driven. I didn&rsquo;t have time for it, and in the years since Katrina I felt burned by what I now felt was a false front that we were all in this together.</p>
<p>My neighbors and I parted ways, and within half a block everything changed. I saw a group of kids on bikes ahead of me and turned to avoid what looked like trouble. Two stray dogs came charging toward me, but I was too slow to realize it was because someone was about to club me from behind. Because it was from behind, I never got a good look at who it was, but he probably used a two-by-four to hit me, a popular weapon in New Orleans these days. I hit the pavement and skidded across. {snip} They took my iPhone, left the cash, and then they were gone.</p>
<p>Now, as I picked myself up from the street, I scolded myself for being so stupid. I should have driven. I found my glasses where they had landed across the street. The skin on my knuckles was scraped off and bleeding. Someone called the police, {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I gave the detective a list of witnesses and names of other people who had encountered this gang  &mdash;  a journalist who had seen the gang just before they got to me, a man who had their photos on a cell phone they had stolen and returned. I even learned their approximate address and that, like many New Orleans children, they had no parents in the city. They were on their own. There was even a video of them causing trouble at a local convenience store  &mdash;  a video the police didn&rsquo;t know about until it aired on the news. But the police did nothing with this information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This crime was classified as a simple robbery.</p>
<p>In fact, it had been six months since I&rsquo;d taken a walk on these streets, after a bunch of kids shot 16 rounds in front of my house; {snip}. A few months later, I found myself running through my dark yard to retrieve my dogs while someone in the yard behind me fired a machine gun into the air. This is the New Orleans I now know.</p>
<p>If you are looking for drugs, you have a wealth of opportunities for comparison shopping on my little block. There are gangs selling from half the stoops, although they don&rsquo;t actually live here. They drive in to do business, taking over the stoops of the elderly, who are too frightened to report anything. Early in the morning, you can watch people picking up their stash for work, and then again in the evenings on the way home. Sometimes, passage through the block is impossible, due to the stalled vehicles hoping for their dealer to return. {snip}</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always this way. Three years ago, when I moved from a rental in Bywater to purchase a renovated house in the Holy Cross neighborhood in the Lower Ninth Ward, there was no crime here. There were virtually no people. Friends expressed their concern at my living in a completely abandoned neighborhood, but I quickly grew used to the glorious quiet. The silence was broken by tour buses, hoping to survey the destruction that still hadn&rsquo;t been cleared, surprised to see that there were actually people living there again, stopping to ask which way it was to the Brad Pitt houses they&rsquo;d seen on CNN. In the mornings I could walk my three dogs past block after block of empty housing, the doors still standing open with debris visible inside. The last time I walked my dogs, one of the dealers outside the bar on the corner said he&rsquo;d shoot my 10-year-old mastiff if he ever looked at him funny again.</p>
<p>Whenever I call the landlord of the house next to mine, to let him know about the guns, or the constant drug dealing, or the dirty diapers tossed from his property onto mine, he says he is powerless to take action. After all, he left the city to avoid dealing with people like the ones to whom he currently rents  &mdash;  and with Section 8 paying a premium, he&rsquo;s just one of dozens of slumlords who have poisoned the neighborhood for all the true neighbors who have returned.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So five years after Katrina, I find myself longing for those early, golden, empty days, when the streets were barren and we could find parking anywhere we went. Back then, I took great offense at the people who voiced their hope that many of the displaced might never return. Now, in spite of my better judgment, I&rsquo;ve become one of them.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m always amused by White Humanity&rsquo;s addiction to New Orleans, inspite of the dangers.  They all acutally think the situation will improve in the future and they won&rsquo;t be in such constant danger. Probably the booze is to blame for such insanity.   </p>

		<p>What kind of simpleton would buy a house in the Lower Ninth Ward and expect it to be any less than a Somalia-style hellhole?  A White liberal journalist, that&rsquo;s who!  </p>
<p><i>A few months later, I found myself running through my dark yard to retrieve my dogs while someone in the yard behind me fired a machine gun into the air&hellip;one of the dealers outside the bar on the corner said he&rsquo;d shoot my 10-year-old mastiff if he ever looked at him funny again&hellip;</i></p>
<p>I notice that he makes no mention at all of owning or carrying a gun himself.  He complains about all the other guns in his neighborhood, but doesn&rsquo;t have a brains to buy one for himself.  The vicious drug dealer who threatened his dog clearly knows where Mr. Foster lives, as do the thugs that hit him from behind with a board.  And yet he hasn&rsquo;t even considered getting the means to defend his own life.  Is he planning to rely on the mercy of black thugs?  Such despicable weakness!  </p>

		<p>Most libs I&rsquo;ve encountered usually were quite careful to steer clear of minorities except under controlled conditions.Safe, middle class nonwhites are of course preferred, usually in a majority white setting. To be avoided are representatives of the vast majority of the minorities, about 90% of them. The libs have usually found the money to isolate themselves in housing, schools for their children, areas of travel, etc. Watch what they do, not what they say. That the writer had some awakening is nice, but he&rsquo;s just now finding out what others have known all along. Of course, he might just decide to run for it, as they all do, all the while being dishonest about the reasons for it. But at least for now, while he&rsquo;s still reeling, some of the truth comes out.  </p>

<p>This article has much in common with the AR cover story, &#8220;The Wages of Idealism&#8221; (Sept. 2010).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often said that liberalism is a form of mental illness characterized by an inability to see reality. The question is why is this condition so pervasive among whites? Why do whites blame themselves for the brutality of blacks? Why do whites blame themselves for black failure? Why do whites beat themselves up after they themselves have been beaten by blacks?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any hope for Mr. Foster. It&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;ll spend the rest of his life (and career) pondering what he and society have done wrong. Institutional racism? White neglect? White indifference? White malice? All the above and more?</p>
<p>Mr. Foster does end the piece with this:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This is New Orleans five years after the storm   &mdash;   not so different, after all, from what it always was.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Even before this attack, Mr. Foster knew what the population of New Orleas was like but he made the effort to keep the truth even from himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Foster includes a snail mail address on his blog. Perhaps AR can send Mr. Foster a copy of the Sept. 2010 issue cover story &#8220;The Wages of Idealism&#8221;. I&rsquo;d like to believe he might learn something though I doubt he will.</p>

		<p>The writer skillfully leaves out the race of the criminals and low-lives but it has black written all over it.  Only a black man would say &#8220;he&rsquo;d shoot my 10-year-old mastiff if he ever looked at him funny again.&#8221;  Black people bring a certain atmosphere wherever they go with struggling with everyday tasks at the center of it.  The writer got stuck in the black atmosphere where he couldn&rsquo;t even walk four blocks without being attacked and couldn&rsquo;t get his dog from his backyard without being threatened.</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.  Liberalism/progressive-ism truly is a mental disorder.  More of his &#8220;wisdom&#8221; from his blog, regarding the publication of this article at Salon:</p>
<p><a href="https://kenfoster.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://kenfoster.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I also decided not to read any of the idiotic comments that were likely to follow. But a few people have filled me. Apparently I deserved it. Because I moved to a black neighborhood, and I should have known better than that. Aside from the fact that this theory actually ignores the specifics of the story (the mugging didn&rsquo;t happen in my neighborhood), it is also a mortifying racist suggestion in response to a story that doesn&rsquo;t once mention race. But that&rsquo;s the internet for you, isn&rsquo;t it? &#8220;</p>

		<p>What I found most interesting was the message boards on Salon for this article.  This magazine has a pretty liberal orientation but based on the comments I saw on the message board it felt like I was reading posts on AmRen.  Most of the comments were negative about New Orleans and the author.  No one, not even Salon readers are fooled by the PC nonsense anymore; it&rsquo;s gone far too long and grows more absurd by the day.</p>

		<p>Mr. Foster sounds like an idealistic fool. He bought a house in the lower ninth ward of New Orleans?! And what makes him sound even more crazy is his disbelief at the gun-toting, drug dealing scum he&rsquo;s surrounded by? Unfortunately, this is the problem with a lot of people in this country. They have to practically be hit over the head (or shot) with the truth to admit the deplorable conditions that exist in this country. I wasn&rsquo;t raised in a country like what it&rsquo;s turning into and frankly I&rsquo;m tired of it and the namby pamby Mr. Fosters. I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t make excuses for people like him anymore. From now on I only make time for people who have pride in themselves and are not afraid to stand up for and protect themselves!</p>

		<p>We all know that liberals either learn the hard way before becoming race realists or they never learn at all.  So cut this guy some slack.

		<p>The fact that you don&rsquo;t mention race doesn&rsquo;t make the story non-racial,  it just makes it dishonest, assuming your assaulters were black.  It&rsquo;s worse than that: it makes it brutally racist.  It is lying in support of black on white racist violence, it isn&rsquo;t racially neutral, it&rsquo;s murderously anti-white, typical white-hating liberal racism of precisely the sort that caused the ethnic cleansing of New Orleans in the first place.  </p>
<p>&#8220;[N]ot so different, after all, from what it always was.&#8221;  No,  liberal, not what it always was,  but what your hate made it. </p>

		<p>  These journalists are definitly not the brightest stars in the universe,but sometimes their stupidity takes your breath away. But the sad thing is they sit like judges from their newspapers or TV stations passing judgement on everybody else. A particularly disgusting episode was the lynching of Nobel laureate Dr. Watson (who discovered DNA}  back in 2007. They crucified one of the top scientists  for an opinion about Africa,even though they know nothing about the subject.</p>

<p>Although SALON readers are probably more likely to be liberal than conservative, they&rsquo;re smart enough to read between the lines and grasp that Ken Foster was not assaulted by Amish or Jews or Japanese-Americans. Some even spelled it out clearly.</p>
<p>Unhappily, most SALON readers, like even smart Jews and well-educated Asian-Americans, persist in voting for candidates whose interests and sympathies are wholly antithetical to theirs.</p>

		<p>Most white liberals come into contact with few blacks.  Most of these are either exceptional, or they are in subordinate positions that they accept without resentment.  From their sheltered positions liberals condemn the &#8220;white racism&#8221; of white blue collar workers who have learned to fear black crime.  <br>
 <br>
White liberals call for &#8220;a dialogue on race.&#8221;  If there is to be a real dialogue one of the topics needs to be black social pathology, especially black crime.  As Jim Crow drifts farther back into the past, it becomes increasingly difficult to blame black social pathology on the legacy of racial discrimination.  </p>

		<p>Most liberals know that low-class blacks are dangerous, and they avoid them.  To remain PC, however, or to stay in particular jobs or social circles, they will pretend to think and do otherwise.  The danger is that young, naive people will believe their nonsense and become victims of all the crimes and life disruptions that characterize the ghetto.</p>

		<p>I think is inevitable that gene mapping and decoding will reveal a specific or more likely a very complex interaction of genes that are responsible for faith and religous belief. <br>
Our lineage gradually encounterd the basic drawback of self- awareness and evolved the ability to dampen reality.  This ability had remarkable survival advantages and was selected.</p>
<p>Liberal thought has all the hallmarks of religous belief, with  adherance to seemingly irrational and contradictory dogma that becomes stronger under attack. This may be a consequence of their widespread sucularism, forcing them to a cause they can really belive in, although that seems like a simplistic conclusion.  I hope that they will not be as resiliant as conventional religion, but I suspect that rationality will not be their downfall.</p>

<p>Hence, if something untoward happens (to them), it must have been THEIR FAULT, in some strange way. After all, when you&rsquo;re the center of the universe, nothing can happen without your involvement, your permission &hellip;. right?</p>

		<p>This guy&rsquo;s a literal example of how some people refuse to wake up to reality even when it sneaks up behind them and whacks them over the head with a two-by-four.</p>
<p>For a minute there, it sounded like he was starting to suspect that the world doesn&rsquo;t actually work the way he thinks it works, but he started back-pedaling almost immediately, putting the blinders back on. It&rsquo;s classic denial.</p>
<p>If he has any brains at all, he&rsquo;ll move out of that neighborhood, but he&rsquo;ll rationalize his reasons and it won&rsquo;t be long until his old mindset has completely reasserted itself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known a lot of people like this. They can be liberals or conservatives; it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter. THey all have one thing in common: a refusal or inability to see the world the way it really is. </p>

		<p>Some interesting reading can be found by clicking on sbuffalonative&rsquo;s link in post #5. Foster&rsquo;s short follow-up to this article has 9 comments on it. He argues with a poster claiming to be a race realist. </p>
<p>When the poster argues that blacks are violent because it is part of their primitive nature instead of some magically inflicted poverty, Foster replies with &#8220;So how do you explain all the black populations around the world that aren&rsquo;t violent?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. My jaw dropped. </p>
<p>Then the poster asked for examples. Foster replied with a list that included S. Africa and Zimbabwe close to it&rsquo;s top. Actually, it looked like a list of any country that has any black population at all. But since Foster insinuated in his earlier post that this sort of black ghetto crime must be uniquely American, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he really thought that all those places must peaceful and happy and at-one-with-nature and all that happy garbage.</p>
<p>Amazing. Pathetic, but amazing.</p>

		<p>As Frank Rizzo the former police commissioner and Mayor of Philadelphia once said &#8221; liberals are conservatives who have not been mugged yet&#8221;,.Rizzo is also the same guy who responded to black panthers threatening the police force asking them if they would like to have a shoot out near Philadelphia city hall. Real men like Rizzo have been replaced with bureaucratic politically correct wimps who give in to thugs and shrink when threatened.</p>

		<p>I enjoy and learn a lot from reading these posts. #25 used an interesting phrase &#8220;race realist&#8221;. With Foster stating &#8220;so how do you explain all the black populations around the world that aren&rsquo;t violent?&#8221; I believe this proves the man is delusional. There is no such thing as peaceful black populations - just delusional people like him who distort or even lie to perpetuate the myth that black people live like white people. Now, it&rsquo;s true, more and more white youth are emulating black behavior and dress, but that only proves what fools they and the media are who push this myth. Any one who is honest with themselves and has eyes in their head can see the truth. Which is why these fools like to call us racist. We are not. We are RACE REALISTS.</p>

<p><i>Violent victimization of whites by blacks is modeled in a racially mixed inner-city neighborhood. Its evolution is traced from the first black to move in, to the last white who moves out. The probability of a white being violently attacked is developed as a function of a neighborhood&rsquo;s racial composition.</i></p>

 <i>&#8220;Most liberals know that low-class blacks are dangerous, and they avoid them. To remain PC, however, in order to stay in particular jobs or social circles, they will pretend to think and do otherwise. The danger is that young, naive people will believe their nonsense and become victims of all the crimes and life disruptions that characterize the ghetto.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>__   __   __   __   __   </p>
<p>True. And that truth carries over into all aspects of life, including into social/professional areas and the workplace where PC  often reigns supreme.  On the job, we are all expected (indeed, required) to pay lip service to  obligatory Political Correctness and to the various shibboleths of the new secular religion of Equality/Diversity.  No questioning of this &#8220;cult&#8221; is allowed.  Doubters are not tolerated. </p>
<p>Thus, everything in life   &mdash;   everything within that matrix   &mdash;   becomes dual.  It operates on a dual level:   there is what is OFFICIAL, and there is what is  REAL.   You have to juggle the two.  It&rsquo;s up to you to figure out the difference (but not to let on that you know).  And it&rsquo;s up to you to play along with the game  and do it skillfully.</p>
<p>Some of us are gifted with being able to see through this transparency right away.  I envy them.  Those lucky, perceptive persons see the hypocrisy all around them and know how to play along with it.  It does not seem to faze them.</p>
<p>I was someone, however, who takes everything very seriously and very literally.  I grew up believing what I was told.  Therefore, as a naive and sincere young liberal, I had a harder time figuring out that this was all just a game    &mdash;   but that you&rsquo;re not supposed to believe it or take it seriously&hellip; (although you&rsquo;re supposed to pretend that you do).</p>
<p>That makes it much harder for us who really do believe in the system and trust what we&rsquo;ve been taught.  Thus,  we can&rsquo;t understand why it isn&rsquo;t working out the way it&rsquo;s supposed to.  This isn&rsquo;t what our clergymen and teachers told us!  Could it be our fault?   Have we done something wrong?   It takes us longer to wake up and finally  realize that not everything we were taught is really so, and that a lot of it is just nonsense,  but that we are required to pay lip service to it anyway   &mdash;   if we want to get along and hold a job.</p>
<p>I imagine it&rsquo;s a lot like being raised a good Moslem in Saudi Arabia, and beginning to open one&rsquo;s eyes and have doubts, but not daring to open one&rsquo;s mouth!  Here, the official cult is just a different one. And here it is secular. No matter! </p>
<p>As a consequence of this hypocritical education, I (and I&rsquo;m sure many of us)  went through some harsh life experiences that we could have avoided if only we knew that this PC &#8220;religion&#8221;  was a false cult, so to speak.  After a number of such experiences, it&rsquo;s quite a jolt when you finally begin to open your eyes and realize that we&rsquo;ve  been lied to all our lives.  Lied to by respectable people, authorities,  people whom we trusted!  Some of us realize  this jolting fact  sooner than others.  And some others never do.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to reconcile it   &mdash;   the &#8216;cognitive dissonanace&rsquo;, I believe it&rsquo;s called. It requires a re-adjusting of one&rsquo;s values and one&rsquo;s life-view. </p>
<p>I hope Mr. Foster opens his eyes and realizes it sooner than later, for his own sake.  Or perhaps he already has, but cannot say so &hellip; because, as you said,  as a journalist he is in a job where clear and realistic vision (at least on race) is not allowed.    As Bon has said here repeatedly, most of us have families to raise and bills to pay; we do not live in a vacuum where we have complete freedom to do as we choose.   And so she is forced into the unpleasant position of being a hypocrite (like many millions) and paying lip service to this &#8220;false cult&#8221; if she wants to keep her job and his paycheck.  The choice is hers.</p>

		<p>Mr Foster mentions CNN in passing. My wife likes to watch CNN International, and their pandering to the non-white, non-Christian world is amazing (while they&rsquo;re not busy smearing whites and Christians and true Conservatives).  Just an hour ago they were showing some white woman blubbering about how the blacks in a hospital in New Orleans were singing some Kumbaya-like song in the days after Katrina.  As well, they ran a series on children being accused of being witches in Nigeria, without ever coming to the conclusion that this is, if not solely, a overwhelmingly black phenomenon (a newsreader actually said &#8220;this happens all over the world&#8221;!&hellip;where, I would like to know, other than black Africa).  It&rsquo;s really maddening to have to listen to.</p>

		<p>My take on Ken after scanning his blog is that he is hooked on dogs, their &#8220;psychology&#8221;, and dull - witted. I mean, I like dogs for the fun they have running around my living room (dachshunds) but I don&rsquo;t confuse them with truly significant events in my life, like what&rsquo;s going on with my human neighbors, relatives, and friends.<br>
This guy seems to have checked out humanity and found it wanting. <br>
His blog is a pile of indifferent comments. I suspect chronic depression is his lot.</p>

		<p>  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve often said that liberalism is a form of mental illness characterized by an inability to see reality. The question is why is this condition so pervasive among whites? </p>
<p>sbuffalonative</p>
<p>Because of the way reality has been presented to them via K-12 government schools and media, both of which present an upside down world where blacks are perpetual victims of White brutality and therefore cannot be racists  &mdash;  the implicit message being that Whites, because of &#8216;past sins&rsquo;, deserve whatever brutality is inflicted upon them by blacks or any other non-White race.</p>
<p>As Professor MacDonald writes:  &#8220;most Whites are used to seeing themselves as the bad guy and have internalized that attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3xr4nm7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3xr4nm7</a></p>
<p>Whites (and blacks) have been steeped in media/academic White-hating propaganda and lies, started at a very young age, for four decades now.  As jewamongyou perfectly and succinctly states:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I might feel sorry for the guy, wallowing in his own ignorance - but since he is a journalist, he is responsible for poisoning the minds of others. Who knows how many whites have died because of journalists like him&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Asians and hispanics are jumping on the victim bandwagon as well, as evidenced by the new textbooks I received for the coming school year.  But to be sure, Whites are still portrayed as genocidal colonists and bloodthirsty racists, just as they are on TV and in movies, of which the hugely popular Avatar is a recent example.</p>
<p>Joe Webb reports this in his review:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the battle, the chief Bad Guy is a jarhead (Marines) colonel who wants to kill all the Good Natives. Blue eyes and a very White Marine, he of course, is beaten by bows and arrows and big scary animals (a la Tarzan). </p>
<p>The movie ends with the animals and the natives driving the White Imperialists off their planet&hellip;the Forest is saved, unobtainium is left in the ground, and the White Men discover that the spirit of the natives is greater than the White man&rsquo;s technology. Like Bladerunner&rsquo;s replicants, the natives are more human than homo sapiens  &mdash;  Whites that is. The few other folks who help the natives are Earthlings  &mdash;  Blacks and browns, who of course, side with the natives. They recognize a brother when they see one&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/38w8r62</p>
<p>I takes decades of reality for the brainwashing to wear off, if it ever does.  Whites have been known to rationalize and forgive the most brutal attacks by blacks upon themselves and their loved ones.  I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope this will change.</p>

<p>Recently re-watched Avatar (something I never thought I&rsquo;d do) with my stepchildren. Had to make a point of highlighting the absurdity of the plot, and how the All-Peaceful-Righteous-&-At-One-With-Nature-Primitive is really a myth created by white folks. The two little ones are still too young to grasp anything more than pretty colors on a screen. The oldest though, I was pleasantly surprised, seemed immediately skeptical of the whole thing. Even without my help. </p>
<p>And as we all know, the only reason they called it Avatar was because there may have been legal troubles if they had actually gone ahead &amp; called it &#8220;Dances with Smurfs.&#8221;</p>
