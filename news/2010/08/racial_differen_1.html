<h1><a href="/ar/1993/01/index.html#cover">Racial Differences  &mdash;  Why They Matter</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Robertson Boggs, American Renaissance, January 1993</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The previous two issues of <cite>American Renaissance</cite> have taken up what is probably the most forbidden subject in America today: racial differences. The subject is forbidden for good reason. A frank acknowledgement of racial differences destroys the basis for policies that are central to American society. It may even destroy the basis for thinking that a multi-racial society is desirable or even possible. The reasons for which racial differences are suppressed are therefore <em>precisely the ones for which they must be recognized,</em> for America&rsquo;s collective position on these questions affects the nation&rsquo;s very soul.</p>

</table><p><b>Who Promotes Equality?</b></p>
<p>The idea of racial equality  &mdash;  even of racial <em>equivalence</em>  &mdash;  now dominates public discourse in America, but who promotes it and why? The most ruthless egalitarians are Marxists. They stand for an almost nihilistic rejection of every distinction among people: rich and poor, stupid and smart, male and female, ugly and beautiful, healthy and perverse. Despite Marxism&rsquo;s collapse in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe, there is still a small but influential contingent of American intellectuals who believe that wealth is illegitimate, nationality is spurious, intelligence is an accident of environment, and race is meaningless.</p>
<p>These ideas are now part of the air Americans breathe. They have enormous built-in momentum and for most people it is easier to believe an old lie than to understand a new truth.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the subject of racial differences is so disagreeable and sordid that decent people should leave it alone.</p>

</table><p>However, an increasing number of Americans oppose the investigation of racial differences because they are afraid of where it might lead. Herbert Spencer wrote that the greatest of infidelities was the fear that the truth may be bad; today one of the most common reasons for opposing discussion of racial differences is the fear that the truth may be very bad indeed.</p>
<p>The most simple and common form this infidelity takes is the view that the subject of inherent racial differences is so disagreeable and sordid that decent people should leave it alone. Today it is probably the people who think this  &mdash;  the well  &mdash;  intentioned obscurantists  &mdash;  who are the greatest obstacle to free discussion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in a society that prides itself on the First Amendment, there should be a presumption at all times in favor of the truth. Democracy is said to <em>require</em> the truth. Therefore, the questions that must be answered are: What is the cost of concealing the truth, and what would be the cost of revealing it? The price paid for the truth must be enormous in order to justify ignorance and lies.</p>
<p><b>The Price of Ignorance</b></p>
<p>What is the price of refusing to acknowledge racial differences? It is as simple and as staggering as this: America will <em>never</em> solve its racial problems.</p>
<p>The most immediate problem is that blacks and, to a lesser extent, Hispanics are failing in disproportionate numbers. If we are to believe that all races are equally talented and hard-working then the failures of blacks and Hispanics cannot be their own fault. They can only be the fault of white people. Therefore every time a non-white takes drugs, goes on welfare or commits a crime it is a silent indictment of &#8220;racist&#8221; white people, past and present. It cannot be otherwise if all races have the same natural potential.</p>

</table><p>Because our society has turned its back on the real causes of black failure, it must devote itself to searching for and &#8220;eliminating&#8221; spurious causes. If the theory is that blacks fail because they do not have proper &#8220;role models&#8221; we hire unqualified blacks and put them in positions of authority. If white society has destroyed black self-esteem we promote grandiose fantasies about African history. If segregated schooling is bad for blacks we send them to white schools. If we then find that black children get the worst grades, we devalue the curriculum so everyone can get &#8220;A&#8221;s. If standardized tests discriminate against blacks we do away with them. If &#8220;racist&#8221; employers prefer not to hire blacks, we force employers to hire them. If a &#8220;racist&#8221; society still manages to impoverish blacks we give them welfare and food stamps.</p>
<p>When one grand project to lift up the black man mysteriously fails, America embarks on yet another, but each successive failure is taken only to confirm the terrible truth: Whites must be even more viciously racist than anyone had thought possible. Therefore, each new experiment is launched with more denunciations of white wickedness and appeals to white guilt. No opportunity is lost to invoke the memory of slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, and the lynch mob.</p>
<p>The effect on some whites of these constant denunciations of &#8220;racism&#8221; is an exaggerated eagerness to submit to every black demand. At the least threat of violence, college presidents promise to build blacks-only dormitories and hire more black professors. Race riots are solemnly searched for &#8220;root causes.&#8221; Every silly version of African history and every improbable theory of &#8220;black genocide&#8221; gets a respectful hearing. The media&rsquo;s willingness to bow to film-maker Spike Lee&rsquo;s demand that he speak only to black reporters is only the latest capitulation.</p>
<p>The other direct effect on whites is that they suffer the very racial discrimination that civil rights laws were supposed to prohibit. The injustices of affirmative action are visited on every new generation of white Americans that applies to college or needs a job. The burden falls on young whites who have grown up since the abolition of legal discrimination against <em>blacks</em> and who by no moral legerdemain can be held responsible for whatever wrongs may have been done to blacks in the past. The meekness with which young whites accept discrimination and the diligence with which their elders mete it out to them are among the wonders of our era.</p>
<p>Clearly, if it were recognized that inherent limitations rather than white &#8220;racism&#8221; were the cause of black failure, young whites would not be saddled with hereditary guilt. Today&rsquo;s orthodoxies require that they be sacrificed to the dogma of equality, while the nation suffers from wasting thousands of university places on blacks who will drop out and from hiring untold numbers of blacks for jobs for which they are not qualified.</p>
<p>Finally, recognition of racial differences would be a vital first step toward removing the debilitating burden of guilt that so many whites appear to carry. Today&rsquo;s whites need feel no collective guilt because of the status of blacks. Never in the history of the world has a group of blacks enjoyed as high a level of material prosperity as do American blacks. It is a level they would certainly never have achieved on their own.</p>
<p>As research by Linda Gottfredson at the University of Delaware suggests, affirmative action may have pushed black Americans into even higher incomes than would have been possible on ability alone. To blame whites for not promoting blacks even further beyond their natural capacities is ridiculous.</p>
<p><b>The Effect on Blacks</b></p>

</table><p>And how does constant tub thumping about &#8220;racism&#8221; affect blacks? Naturally, they begin to believe what they are told about white wickedness. Blacks might have hated whites for their successes even if they were not always told that whites are conspiring to oppress them; fulminations about imaginary &#8220;racism&#8221; only make their hatred burn hotter.</p>
<p>The black rap singer Sister Souljah recently told blacks that they should leave off killing each other and kill white people instead. She need not have bothered. When blacks commit crimes of violence they already target whites more than half the time (while whites choose black victims only 2.5 percent of the time). A black man is several hundred times more likely to rape a white woman than a white man is to rape a black woman. According to the statistics that are beginning to trickle in, more whites than blacks are victims of &#8220;hate crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black hatred has even reached the following incongruous climax: One third of all blacks think that the government  &mdash;  the same government that devises one minority preference program after another  &mdash;  has invented AIDS as part of an attempt to exterminate them. If ten million blacks actually think that the government is trying to kill them, how are they likely to feel about individual whites?</p>
<p>This march of folly cannot go on much longer. Even the white man has a limited capacity for excusing the failures, hatreds, and delusions of blacks. Even the most mulish liberals are beginning to realize two things: First, no matter how many schemes they try, the racial achievement gap only widens. Second, whites who tell blacks how evil whites are are not repaid with the love and gratitude they expected. They feel the sting of black venom along with everyone else.</p>
<p>Eventually, the dogma of racial equality will founder on the facts. But until it does, our country will waste its wealth and its moral energy on &#8220;solutions&#8221; to imaginary problems. Blacks will continue to blame their failings on whites and to vent their hatred in increasingly terrible ways. Whites will try to convince themselves that mounting black mayhem is &#8220;legitimate rage&#8221; in the face of entrenched white racism. There can be no end to this madness as long as our nation refuses to recognize the inherent, genetic factors that limit black success.</p>
<p><b>Other Costs</b></p>

</table><p>Although a continuation of the vicious cycle in black-white relations is the single most obvious cost of suppressing the truth about race, there are other costs that may be even more important in the long term. Our current welfare policies ensure that the unintelligent and irresponsible have more children than the intelligent and responsible. This means that the average intelligence of the American population  &mdash;  of all races  &mdash;  is falling, by about one IQ point per generation, according to a very conservative estimate by Prof. Richard Herrnstein of Harvard.</p>
<p>The way to stop the genetic decline is to reduce the number of births to the unintelligent and incompetent. Any plan to do so would run headlong into the fact that blacks are vastly overrepresented in the ranks of such people (see book review, <a href="/ar/1993/01/index.html#article1" target="shockley" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>page 6</b></a>). Racial differences are a serious obstacle even to the study of the extent to which intelligence is inherited. It stops any talk of eugenics dead in its tracks. If America is not to sink slowly into genetic mediocrity, it will some day institute eugenic  &mdash;  or at least anti-dysgenic-policies. This will not be possible until racial differences in intelligence are understood and accepted.</p>

</table><p>Immigration policy is another area in which willful ignorance exacts a high long-term cost. Although there are other decisive reasons to manage immigration so as to ensure homogeneity rather than diversity, when the United States accepts immigrants from Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, it is likely to be lowering the genetic quality of its population rather than improving it.</p>
<p>Americans are notorious for short-term thinking. Our budget deficit  &mdash;  a crushing financial burden that we seem happy to pass on to our children  &mdash;  is an example of inexcusable irresponsibility. Current immigration and demographic policies ensure even worse horrors. How long will it take before an increasingly non-white, genetically disadvantaged population pushes its way into every corner of the country? Do we not already glimpse the future in the unspeakable practices that flourish among the underclasses? As the ghetto and the barrio expand, they will cease to be unfortunate enclaves; they will become the United States.</p>
<p>The price we pay for dismissing genetic and racial differences is therefore immense. In the short-term, whites are punished by affirmative action policies because of imaginary &#8220;racism,&#8221; while black hatred grows with every year. In the long term, we have set a course towards decline and barbarism.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Racism&rsquo; and Wounded Feelings</b></p>
<p>What, on the other hand, are the costs of recognizing racial differences? Obscurantists generally cite two. The first is that public acknowledgement that blacks are, on average, less intelligent than whites would justify &#8220;racism.&#8221; Since there is no telling where &#8220;racism&#8221; might lead-slavery? genocide? Nazism?  &mdash;  society must be willing to lie in order to combat these evils. The other is that public acceptance of racial differences would be an intolerable psychological burden to blacks who are already burdened by failure, &#8220;racism,&#8221; and the legacy of slavery.</p>
<p>The &#8220;racism&#8221; argument is usually made by people who seem to think that whites are only waiting for a pretext to wreak anti-black terror. History suggests otherwise. For most of the period during which blacks and whites have been in contact, whites have thought that blacks were inferior. This never led to genocide. Nor does the belief that blacks are less intelligent than whites necessarily lead to slavery. Slavery was <em>abolished</em> both in the United States and in the British Empire by people who were convinced that blacks were less intelligent than whites. There would be consequences to the public acknowledgement of racial differences, but not the orgiastic blood-letting that obscurantists predict.</p>

</table><p>Some misguided whites might use public recognition of racial differences as a pretext to vent prejudices and hatreds of their own. However, would they not be the same people who do so today? The tiny number of whites who commit irrational acts of violence  &mdash;  and a great many other people as well  &mdash;  are already convinced that blacks are, on average, less intelligent than whites. People are driven to violence in part by the profound frustration of believing that their nation is deliberately ignoring crucially important facts about race. Public acceptance of these facts and sensible policies based on them would relieve much of that frustration.</p>
<p>What might these policies be? First of all, quotas and set-asides would not be defensible in a nation that accepted black limitations rather than insisting on white wickedness. The immediate cost to blacks would therefore be the end of unearned benefits. Theoretically, the abolition of affirmative action might be the sole change in policy. The nation might reconcile itself to the inevitability of a black/white performance gap and otherwise continue as before.</p>
<p>However, it is likely that an acknowledgement of racial differences and the genetic laws that underlie them would lead to a revision of immigration, welfare, and even population policies. The consequences of dysgenics are so stark that their public recognition would probably lead to some call for action.</p>
<p>Immigrants would therefore be turned back. Babies likely to be public charges would not be born. Would this be so horrible? In both cases, the &#8220;victims&#8221; would be denied something to which they had no right. Society would benefit immeasurably, and the United States could once more look forward to progress rather than decline.</p>
<p><b>Blows to Self-Esteem</b></p>
<p>The other cost of recognizing racial differences is said to be the psychological damage it would do to blacks, and to a lesser extent, to Hispanics. Strictly speaking, that is their own concern. However, there is reason to think that the truth would hardly be devastating. Each of us, for example, knows people more competent and intelligent than himself. Are we &#8220;devastated&#8221; by this? More to the point, there is evidence that the average North Asian is more intelligent than the average Caucasian. If this were formally demonstrated to be true, would white people be &#8220;devastated&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is gratifying to think that one&rsquo;s group is best in everything but this is hardly necessary for mental health. When they are not starving or slaughtering each other, even Somalis and Ethiopians have managed to rub along without obvious signs of pathology.</p>

</table><p>If anything, an acceptance of racial differences might be <em>good</em> for blacks. The nineteenth century free person of color was certainly not &#8220;devastated&#8221; by general assumptions about black inferiority. Not even slaves showed signs of the degeneracy that freedom subsequently brought to some of their descendants.</p>
<p>Surely, the assumption of inferiority made it <em>easier</em> to accept meager circumstances. Surely, a great deal of today&rsquo;s black hatred stems from the belief that blacks are being cheated out of success that should by rights be theirs. This is a dangerous, embittering state of mind. In all of life&rsquo;s competitions, peace comes only with the maturity to recognize that one has not been cheated by an inferior but bested by a superior. It is therefore a terrible disservice to blacks to tell them that they are the white man&rsquo;s equal. This only sets up expectations that are sure to be disappointed and the resulting hatred could well be much more damaging than would be the acceptance of genetic differences.</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike the search for imaginary &#8220;racism,&#8221; which solves nothing, there actually is a long-term solution for genetic deficiency. If they wished, blacks could embark on an aggressive, sustained eugenics program to narrow the intelligence gap with whites. It is frequently said that the first step towards reform that an alcoholic must take is to recognize his condition. If blacks are to improve, they too must recognize their condition.</p>
<p>But what if blacks refused to accept the verdict of biology? What if they found it impossible to live side by side with a race that was superior both in numbers and in ability? Race is, after all, more than differences in average intelligence. Like all other human groupings, races have many deep-seated reasons to be conscious of how they differ from each other and to wish to preserve those differences. Sometimes separation is best for everyone. There is no theoretical or moral obstacle to separation, and many a marriage has broken up over differences less remarkable than those that distinguish the races.</p>
<p>These, then, are the choices we face with respect to racial differences. We can continue to build our nation upon a biological falsehood and condemn future generations to permanent racial conflict and to the dysgenic consequences of that falsehood. Or we can accept that the laws of heredity that we so profitably apply to animals apply equally to ourselves. Only then will we be able to look forward to progress rather than to retrogression.</p>
<p>Whatever we choose, the laws of nature will not change. Eventually, our perverse decision to reverse the course of evolution will again be reversed. A society that forces the competent to support a growing army of incompetents will some day come crashing down, and in the ensuing chaos it will be the fit who once again survive. &#8220;Drive out nature with a pitchfork,&#8221; wrote the Roman satirist Juvenal, &#8220;and it will nevertheless return.&#8221;

<p><b>The Price of Ignorance</b></p>
<p>The San Bruno jail, in San Mateo County just south of San Francisco, is the oldest operating jail in the state of California. It is also vastly overcrowded, so county authorities plan to expand and modernize it. A prison reform group called the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice has just released a report in which it claims to show that greater prison capacity is not the right solution to the crime problem.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s prize fact is that in San Francisco, blacks are 16 times more likely than whites to be imprisoned, and that though they are only 11 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, they make up 50 percent of the prisoners. This apparently &#8220;proves&#8221; that the criminal justice system is at fault and that prison expansion will only make things worse. The solution, says the protest group, is to solve &#8220;underlying social problems&#8221; rather than arrest malefactors. [Yumi Wilson, Protest Over S.F. Jail Expansion, SF Chron, Oct. 14, 1992.]</p>
<p>Misguided thinking of this kind is inevitable as long as our society refuses to accept racial differences. If the races are equal, disproportionate arrest rates can only reflect social ills. The search for imaginary evils must go on.</td>  </tr></table></div><br>

		<p>I disagree with the author that the acceptance of &#8216;racial differences&rsquo; would end the demonization or at least the restrictions placed on whites. It would provide another rationale in favor of affirmative action. I think affirmative action is doomed, though, in either case. Or at least it can be kept away for a good length of time. The day white men are denied, &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, too, that&rsquo;s the day the hate whitey train will have a hard time keeping it&rsquo;s momentum going. </p>
<p>This article is more relevant than ever, though. It&rsquo;s been my observation that the more a school or workplace engages in &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; and &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; training, the more the public face put forward is that it is whites who are discriminating, and that this is wrong and evil. That is, they demonize whites at the same time they are discriminating against them. Perhaps the demonization, similar to the focus on &#8216;hate-crimes&rsquo; (as if this is normally done by whites), serves to keep whites down so they can be discriminated against in the first place? However, this &#8216;inverted world&rsquo; we live in could be due more to a kind of arrogance than anything else? It&rsquo;s simply the result of there being no white special interest groups speaking up?</p>

		<p>The reason why Whites and other races will always be in contention was touched on early in the article.  Marxism.  It is the INTENT of Marxists to keep the classes at war with each other, and race is a class as much as employer and employee.  Moreover, part of their campaign was and is to gain power over all the educational institutions and poison the minds of all the classes with marxist, utopian, socialist and racial garbage so they become good little socialists always at each other&rsquo;s throats and begging the elites to &#8220;save&#8221; them through more government, more programs, more power to the elites and the government.  Mao and the Soviets achieved their goals relatively quickly through bloody revolution and genocide.  We are going more slowly due to our innate embrace of freedom and individuality.  Hence, the frog in the water approach, and genocide is committed not overtly by the Government, but by their surrogates the blacks and browns against the whites&hellip;.the &#8220;flyover&#8221; - so called - whites who just refuse to &#8220;get it&#8221; and continue to resist and impede the greater socialist utopia.  The thing all these folks seem to forget is that we white Americans are not slavs or chinese or blacks.  We have innate goodness and a sense of fair play so seem to be easy victims - tolerating much.  But what they forget is that once aroused by the realization that war us upon us, and only warfare in return can end it - Americans becomes as single minded, ruthless, efficient, organized and violent as any people on earth.  More so than any people on earth.  In such arousal, NO nation, people, or traitorous fifth column  can expect anything but bloody defeat.  With a vengeance.  The reason the war between the States was so horrible was because it was white American fighting white American.  We breezed through the Maori, the Mexicans, the Indian nations, the Arabs, and any other non-white enemy.  It&rsquo;s our history.  We tolerate much, but when the limit is reached, we become the berserker.<br>
But a berserker with intelligence, organization, direction, and ruthlessness.</p>

		<p>I have been on the scientifically supported side of this argument for 40 years. The proof is in the tests and the proof is in the pudding. Those who score low on IQ tests score low on the job.</p>
<p>Before I retired and sold my engineering company to my employees I based my hiring policies almost entirely on IQ and personality testing. As a result, I was sued twice by unqualified Blacks who apparently made it through college as the result of a social engineering scheme and not because of any effort or aptitude on their part.</p>
<p>I won both lawsuits, if you define &#8220;winning&#8221; as throwing $70K out the window each time to convince a judge to use common sense. </p>
<p>During the time my children were growing up I sold two homes at great loss to keep my children away from the tide of our &#8220;legal equals&#8221; who rapidly turned our former neighborhoods into unlivable war zones.</p>
<p>I know that I am not the only White guy with stories like this to tell. Since the 1960&rsquo;s our misguided politicians have tried to force the historical majority of America to sit in the back of the bus as some form of social justice. Why is it that so few White Flighters are willing to speak up to force the federal government to return our society to one in which rewards only come as a result of merit. </p>

		<p>When will this madness over IQ equality end?  This country started on that path in the late 1950&rsquo;s and have not stopped since.  China and Russia had their madness which lasted about 45 years  &mdash;  the social experiment with Communism.  It led to no where because it was against Nature.  Communism was a fight against human individualism.  This craziness on trying to pretend the majority of blacks and hispanics are on par with whites and Asians IQ&rsquo;s will also eventually burn itself out.  But will it end before it destroys this country?  Education, job performance, etc everything has been dumbed down to accommodate this misguided belief/cult.  It went as crazy as to elect an inexperienced black man as president.  This country knew so little of his background except as being a community organizer.  What the heck was that and how does that qualify him to be in Congress and now president?  But graduated from Harvard, you say, but that was due to affirmative action.  Harvard needed blacks for political reasons and appearance sake.  This country is set on a wrong course.  Hopefully, it can be saved without it crashing completely.</p>

		<p>One thing the article fails to point out is the utter hypocrisy of the arrogant, self-righteous marxists in the media, academia and intelligentsia. </p>
<p>*The most ruthless egalitarians are Marxists. </p>
<p>Egalitarianism is for you, not them.  </p>
<p>These evil hypocrites continue to insist on promoting the joys of multi-culturalism, busing of urban blacks into your White child&rsquo;s school in the name of &#8216;equal access&rsquo;, placement of Section 8 apartments in your neighborhood, wholesale importation of welfare dependents from the Fourth World into the US  &mdash;  yet hold themselves above and apart from the hell they create by living in exclusive, 95+% White, gated neighborhoods and sending their precious children to exclusive, often ethnic-based schools.</p>
<p>*They stand for an almost nihilistic rejection of every distinction among people: rich and poor, stupid and smart, male and female, ugly and beautiful, healthy and perverse. </p>
<p>While holding themselves separate, of course, believing themselves to be much smarter, more enlightened, more educated, more evolved than you, the average White Kulak.  To them, you are expendable  &mdash;  and they&rsquo;ll pit black/hispanic against you to achieve this end, their Prime Directive.</p>
<p>*Despite Marxism&rsquo;s collapse in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe, there is still a small but influential contingent of American intellectuals who believe that wealth is illegitimate, nationality is spurious, intelligence is an accident of environment, and race is meaningless.</p>
<p>This is straight out of the Frankfurt School and Boasian Anthropology, two &#8216;schools of thought&rsquo; that have had deleterious effects on Whites and White American Culture.</p>
<p>Our marxist masters claim &#8216;wealth is illegitimate&rsquo;  &mdash;  but only for you, not them.  The purpose of this lie is for Whites to hand over their &#8216;ill-gotten/stolen&rsquo; wealth, land and any other property they might own  &mdash;  satanic taxes will take care of anything left. &#8216;Nationality is spurious&rsquo; they say  &mdash;  but it is only Whites who must deracinate themselves  &mdash;  blacks, hispanics, Asians and all other non-Whites are encouraged to keep their languages and celebrate their cultures,  and to look upon Whites as evil, racist oppressors, deserving to be stripped of their culture and heritage.  </p>
<p>&#8216;Intelligence is an accident&rsquo; they claim, which claim should be mocked, laughed at and ridiculed as mountains of hard, irrefutable scientific data exist to disprove this specious, stupid lie.  And they advocate &#8216;race is meaningless&rsquo;, pushing this lie on the rest of us while surrounding themselves with those exactly like themselves.</p>
<p>As M. Taylor has written and said:  If Multiculturalism were so wonderful, people would be rushing toward it rather than doing everything in their power to avoid it.</p>
<p>*What is the cost of concealing the truth, and what would be the cost of revealing it? The price paid for the truth must be enormous in order to justify ignorance and lies.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the cost of the truth:  62 million dead in the Old Soviet Union by the time the egalitarian lies inevitably crashed in upon themselves</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t agree more with #3. Even Professor Watson, one of the two scientists who discovered DNA, has publicly spoken about hard facts that confirm innate inequality of races.  But he was told to pipe down by Cambridge University or face expulsion. In the US and UK, no research can even be performed on the subject of racial differences out of fear of what it will show. I know this because a good college buddy of mine did a PhD in biology at Princeton and was told he could not do such research. </p>

		<p>I was born into the milder form of Jim Crow that existed in the border states and have seen the whole evolution of the civil rights revolution.  In my youth, I absorbed the liberal arguments so popular among intellectuals, while almost everyone else around me held race-realist views.  Finally, through my own research, I found that I had been wrong for decades.  <br>
Like many Southerners, I tend to like friendly, law-abiding black people.  I&rsquo;m glad they now have equal opportunities.  But the latter is all society can really do for them.  No one of any ethnicity can be anything he wants unless he has the ability and drive.  Society only hurts blacks when it tells them the opposite and blames it on racism.  Many become frustrated and resentful.<br>
In my opinion, however, there is no necessity to tell blacks that, statistically, they fall below whites in average IQ.  Believe me, they already know this.  We should take away the race-based perks, and allow everyone a level playing field.  Allow private enterprise to discriminate racially as well as by gender, class, or anything else.  The liberals will continue to wail in their echo chambers, of course.  Ignore them.</p>

Very few of these &#8220;American intellectuals&#8221; are Marxists.  I have known Marxists.  They do not hide what they believe in.  Those on the right do not enhance their credibility by calling everyone they disagree with a Marxist.  <br>
 <br>
Any political thinker should be studied for insight rather than doctrine.  Karl Marx did not claim infallibility.  When he learned that others did on his behalf he said, &#8220;I thank God that I am not a Marxist.&#8221; </p>

		<p>there is evidence that the average North Asian is more intelligent than the average Caucasian. If this were formally demonstrated to be true, would white people be &ldquo;devastated&rdquo;?<br>

- William Robertson Boggs<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The different races have evolved in response to different population pressures.  For nearly two thousand years Chinese men who were intelligent enough to pass the Imperial Exam joined the Scholar Gentry.  They were expected to have multiple wives and many children.  Because they were well paid, they could provide well for these children, and most survived and reproduced.  This may explain the higher average IQs of Chinese, although not those of Koreans and Japanese.<br>
 <br>
While this was happening, American Indians and African blacks lived in cultures where the best hunters and warriors had several wives.  Consequently, the best killers had the most children.  This may explain why American Indians, Hispanics - who are part American Indian - and blacks have higher murder rates everywhere in the world they live than whites and North Asians.<br>
 <br>
Intelligence is important in hunting and warfare.  Otherwise most of human evolution would not have happened.  Nevertheless, urban society, and especially a meritocracy, places more of a premium on superior intelligence than a Paleolithic or Neolithic society.  </p>

New Deal reforms reduced economic inequality without reference to race or sex.  Blacks and women benefited.  So did white male blue collar workers.  Consequently, most white male blue collar workers supported the Democrat Party until the late 1960s.  <br>
 <br>
Affirmative action policies reduce opportunities for white men.  Those most negatively impacted are not rich white men, for they already have it made, but white male blue collar workers.  Affirmative action policies are a major reason white male blue collar workers have become a Republican constituency.  </p>

		<p>I can think of no other universally understood truth so hotly denied than the reality of known and quantified differences in intelligence among the races, particularly the substantial deficit between black Africans and all other races.  Even the most devoted liberal knows the truth but will lapse into near-hysteria in his denials of what he knows but doesn&rsquo;t want to believe.</p>
<p>The real tragedy of this perverse refusal to acknowledge reality is that blacks themselves are the most damaged by it.  There are plenty of productive and rewarding occupations that don&rsquo;t require lofty intellectual gifts, though people taught from birth that their failures result from their victimization by others are unlikely to exploit them.  They&rsquo;re mired in hopelessness and smouldering resentment.  Perversely, it even damages blacks who have succeeded on the basis of innate talent and hard work but find themselves regarded with suspicion and resentment by those who assume that they were nothing more than the beneficiaries of forced affirmative action.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s going to face this problem someday without flinching.  My guess is it won&rsquo;t be whites but most likely Northeast Asians, who have fewer childish and sentimental illusions about racial differences.  Of course, it&rsquo;s always possible that Americans will wake up abruptly one day and stagger out of the intellectual fog they&rsquo;ve created on matters of race and simply repeal the Civil Rights Act and all the monstrous programs and distortions that have flowed from it.  But I doubt it.</p>

		<p>The UN has recently criticised Australia for &#8220;Racist&#8221; treatment of the indigenous population here. But first please note:</p>
<p>The Aboriginal population in Australia receive free medical services, free education to tertiary level, generous social welfare, special housing, job creation and educational programs. Yet most aboriginals live in sub-third world conditions, low live expectancy, low employment levels,low school attendance, high imprisonment rates and suffer from widespread alcohol and violence problems. The reasons are fairly obvious but it is &#8220;racist&#8221; to say it.ie. Simply, one has a stone age race of hunter-gatherers who find themselves part of the 21st century and they do not fit in. It is tragic but what are the answers? (Race is definitely an issue)</p>
<p>But Back to the UN, the Australian Government is being &#8220;racist&#8221; because it has replaced part of indigenous people&rsquo;s welfare payments with food vouchers to stop it being spent on alcohol.</p>
<p>Has the UN got any better ideas, perhaps they should look at the similar plight of the Bushman race in Namibia, they cant blame the white man there.</p>
<p>As for the UN being little more than a Marxist think tank, this becomes more and more obvious every passing day.</p>

<p>WE dragged their ancestors here by force (later black immigrants have no special rights, africans should be shipped home directly), and we owe them special treatment of some kind. </p>
<p>Every black should have a job suited to his abilities, adequate minimum living standards, dignity, respect, and equal treatment under the law. </p>

<p>Focusing on the differences dilutes the main problem here: maneuvering the U.S. into the Malthusian trap by &#8220;empowering&#8221; and promoting (by menas of favorism, double standard, and intimidation) the less productive but more assertive and quickly multiplying segments of the American population.</p>

Look into the history of the NAACP!  Those early black protesters only expected what their &#8220;white&#8221; managers and puppeteers told them to  demand or expect.  In point of fact, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any black protesters without sympathetic whites guiding them, funding them,  and managing them from behind the scenes.   That&rsquo;s why there was no NAACP in Brazil or Honduras or Colombia. Only here. A Brazilian NAACP  would never have gotten an inch off the ground.<br>

		<p>Considering that access to the Interent is near universal in the US, (public libraries offer it if you don&rsquo;t have a home computer) there&rsquo;s simply no excuse for any white person to be in the dark about racial differences. For the time being, the first amendment allows sites like Amren.com and VDARE to dispense a near treasure trove of acticles just like the one above which contain compelling evidence that racial differences in average IQ (as well as a host of other traits) are mostly genetic in origin. In 1993 when this article first appeared that was not the case. But as to why so many whites remain so terribly uniformed is something of a scandal. If they knew the truth, all the madness of affirmative action, 12-20 million illegal aliens living here, birthright citizenship, massive legal immigration from the third-world and so many other dispicable realities would come to a screeching halt. </p>

 As much as possible Australian aborigines should be able to live as they always have: that is to say, as stone age hunters.  How possible is that?  Is there room for them to live in reserves?  <br>
 <br>
Australian aborigines fascinate me.  By studying them we can learn how our ancestors lived over 10,000 years ago. <br>
 <br>
Also, how many of them are able to cope with modern white Australian society?  I read that one was recently elected to parliament.   <br>

<p>I think it goes deeper than that. What I mean to say is that I think the differences found in IQ by race go back even further in history. A society smart enough to establish schools and place a premium on intelligence (aside from the kind used to snag an animal) has already demonstrated a greater capacity to think in the long term than the cultures we all know to suffer from an intelligence deficits today.</p>
<p>I also think Europeans and Northeast Asians could kill far better than the other races if they decided to kill for some reason. No other race seems to demonstrate the pioneering spirit that Europeans (and Northeast Asians to a lesser extent) seem to have demonstrated throughout history. I just think Europeans and Asians were in environments were being &#8220;cool&#8221; was favored as a result seem to be less temperamental on average than the races we associate with lower IQ. I think empathy and the ability to think in terms of what Kant called &#8220;the categorical imperative&#8221; (as in, if I throw trash on the ground that&rsquo;s bad b/c society will be bad if everyone acted like that) is what mainly separates the races. I still don&rsquo;t think the average ghetto black even comprehends this basic idea. And again, I think this trait of &#8220;higher thinking&#8221; that separates the races evolved even earlier than you&rsquo;re making it sound.</p>
