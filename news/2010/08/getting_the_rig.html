<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Roughly half the 50 million Americans who suffer from hypertension don&rsquo;t succeed in keeping their blood pressure under control, often because they haven&rsquo;t been prescribed the drug that would work best for them. Now, three new studies are suggesting ways to help make sure patients get the right medications.</p>
<p>Five types of drugs are commonly used for treating hypertension, or high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart attacks and stroke. Doctors often choose among the drugs by trial and error, prescribing several of them in turn to see which works best for a particular patient. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Doctors have known for decades that patients with different physical characteristics respond differently to various hypertension drugs. But little research has focused on matching specific pills to specific patients. The new studies, which appear in the latest issue of the American Journal of Hypertension, represent efforts to provide scientific guidance for doctors treating high blood pressure.</p>
<p>One of the studies, for example, shows that some drugs work better in certain ethnic groups than in others. Two other studies point to the importance of testing patients&rsquo; levels of renin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, as a guide in prescribing blood-pressure medicine. Researchers in each of the studies emphasized that larger-scale trials would be necessary before the findings could become part of official treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the studies, co-authored by Ajay Gupta of Imperial College London, looked at drug responses among 5,425 patients in various countries and across different ethnic groups. For example, in the U.K., south Asians are often given ace inhibitors as a first-line treatment, though the effectiveness of such prescriptions isn&rsquo;t based on any hard evidence. Dr. Gupta&rsquo;s study, for the first time, confirms that south Asians respond especially well to such drugs.</p>
<p>U.K. medical-treatment guidelines say that first-line drug therapies should be guided by a patient&rsquo;s age and race. (Guidelines in the U.S. don&rsquo;t include such suggestions.) Dr. Gupta and his colleagues showed that the same guidelines might also apply for second-line treatments. For example, if a black patient is given a calcium channel blocker or diuretic as the first drug, U.K. guidelines recommend adding an ace inhibitor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nonetheless, one of the new studies, involving 363 patients, confirmed the 1970s finding, showing that measuring the renin level can be an effective method for selecting a blood-pressure medication. The research, by a team led by Stephen Turner of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., found that a patient with a higher renin level probably should not be treated with a diuretic. The patient would probably respond better to a drug, such as a beta blocker, that functions differently in the body.</p>
<p>The predictive effects of renin activity &#8220;were statistically independent of race, age and other characteristics,&#8221; the team&rsquo;s paper concludes. It found that renin levels could also serve as a guide for prescribing add-on therapies for some patients.</p>

		<p>Just yesterday I was rereading Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s comments about blacks.  He stated that, because they sweat more than whites, they urinate less.  I checked this on the net and found a site concerning hypertension meds that claims that they actually do urinate less than whites do.  Of course, anyone who makes this claim to the general public risks being branded a racist.  No matter what the medical community says about blacks and medicine, someone will find fault: either not enough concern is being demonstrated to discover biological differences, or the very assumption that biological differences exist is hateful.</p>

		<p>&#8220;U.K. medical-treatment guidelines say that first-line drug therapies should be guided by a patient&rsquo;s age and race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently race is not a social construct when it helps minorities. If race is really a social construct, and &#8220;experts&#8221; say it is so, then the practice of medicine should not be guided by race. But denying a minority member the benefits of proper health care by denying racial differences would of course be racist. Get it?</p>

		<p>Lol&hellip;..or&hellip;..doctors can continue what works best and is cheap and cost effective&hellip;..which is selecting drugs by trial and error.  Which they fully intend to do, since insurance most definitely will not pay for anything even remotely like what the article suggests.</p>
<p>This is a red herring issue.  And the article lies (by omission) about the most basic issue of all.</p>
<p>The REASON roughly half of people on hypertensive medications do not control their blood pressure is NONCOMPLIANCE.  High BP meds can only lower your blood pressure if you take them.</p>
<p>Guess what factor is most likely to predict compliance?</p>

		<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be that they continue to eat, smoke and drink against their doctors guidlines while thinking the magic pill will cure them could it? <br>

		<p>I have read that ACE inhibitors (and possibly ARBs, another related class of hypertension drugs) do not work well in blacks for some reason. They can also produce a serious side effect called angioedema in them more often than in other ethnic groups.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know these days, like I did years ago, what the British eat on an everyday basis. The working class used to eat high fat, but delicious, fish n chips. Of course that&rsquo;s when there was a white working class in Britain.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if Dr.Gupta took diet into account. I assume Dr Gupta&rsquo;s diet is quite admirable. Not so however the diet of our ever munching African Americans. Beyond the endless chips the young uns devour during a six hour school day, including during all classes, the &#8220;family&#8221; of these kids offers a wonderful choice of dietary cuisine when Shaquana brings in the residence for &#8216;dinner&rsquo;. </p>
<p>KFC, Popeye&rsquo;s (a favorite based on my own extensive conversations with African American youth) or McDonalds. And if that don&rsquo;t kill ya, there is Sunday dinner at Grannie&rsquo;s, where there is such a person and event. Well meaning as Grannie may be, she is killing many more blacks than any overseer or allegedly bigoted employer ever did.</p>
<p>Pour on da gravy!</p>
