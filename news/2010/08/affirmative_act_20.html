<h1><a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129216337">Affirmative Action: How Far Have We Come?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>National Public Radio, August 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As students flock back to America&rsquo;s colleges for the fall semester, commentators across the political spectrum have been debating what&rsquo;s become a lightning-rod issue in the admissions process: affirmative action.</p>
<p>And one of the key figures in that debate made her debut in the public eye as a name on a Supreme Court case.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s Jennifer Gratz, and in 1995 she applied for admission to the University of Michigan. With a 3.8 grade-point average, she thought she was a lock. But the school rejected her.</p>
<p>Gratz remembers getting her rejection letter. &#8220;There were rumors in high school that the University of Michigan used race in their admissions policy,&#8221; she tells NPR&rsquo;s Guy Raz. &#8220;I remember hearing that and thinking, &#8216;There&rsquo;s no way  &mdash;  that can&rsquo;t be true.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Two years later, she sued, claiming she was unfairly denied admission because of the school&rsquo;s affirmative-action policies.</p>
<p>The case eventually was paired with a similar suit against the University of Michigan Law School, and in 2003, the Supreme Court issued its decision on both.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor said a diverse student body did, in fact, represent a &#8220;compelling state interest,&#8221; which the University of Michigan was well was within its rights to pursue. What it could not do, however, was use an automatic race-point system to achieve that diversity.</p>
<p>Justice O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s decision concluded with a prediction: &#8220;The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>A Quarter-Century Is a Long Time</b></p>
<p>Just seven years later, a number of commentators are ready for change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Affirmative Action&rsquo;s Time Is Up,&#8221; Gregory Rodriguez writes in the Los Angeles Times. He argues &#8220;white racial anxiety&#8221; will be &#8220;the most significant and potentially dangerous trend of the coming decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>New York Times columnist Ross Douthat strikes a similar tone in his essay &#8220;The Roots of White Anxiety.&#8221; He writes: &#8220;Among the white working class .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. alienation from the American meritocracy fuels the kind of racially tinged conspiracy theories [Glenn] Beck and others have exploited.&#8221;</p>
<p>Douthat traces the origin of that racial tension back to college campuses: &#8220;The most under-represented groups on elite campuses often aren&rsquo;t racial minorities; they&rsquo;re working class whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Inside the Numbers</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wise [writer and essayist Tim Wise] cites employment data that reveals 1 million black job seekers each year face discrimination. &#8220;We know that job applicants with white-sounding names are 50 percent more likely to get called back for an interview than applicants with black-sounding names, even when all the qualifications are the same,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a misuse of relevant data, Wise says, to suggest working class whites from the heartland are being left out of elite schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet the people who complain about so-called racial preference say nothing about the geographic preferences that actually do work sometimes to the benefit of often-times rural and outlying white folk,&#8221; Wise says.</p>

<p>Somehow there is no &#8216;compelling state interest&rsquo; in maintaining diversity at America&rsquo;s Historically black colleges or at majority black colleges or at women&rsquo;s colleges. Well, the calls for diversity are just as impassioned there too but when they say diversity they also mean more black and women students. </p>

		<p>Notice how to provide balance the author gives Tim Wise equal if not more prominent coverage in the story. Why don&rsquo;t we hear from white student groups at our diversity obsessed universities? Could it be because there are none on the same school grounds where minority activists are paraded about as the embodiment of diversity?</p>

		<p>Working class whites are the ones paying the price for affirmative action, busing, section 8 ghettoization, all the rest. The feel good, elitist whites have more money and always put some distance between themselves and the results of their do-good projects. The less affluent end up living in the deteriorating neighborhoods; having to put their children in the public school system and getting short shrift as resources are drained by the unteachable; if they aren&rsquo;t stellar students, but just fairly good, they get elbowed aside for college admission by poorer performers who are minority. The majority of poor people in this country are white, yet the white do-gooders never care to steer anything towards them. It&rsquo;s always blacks and other non-whites; that&rsquo;s always their pet project.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;The idea that colleges have to have a certain number of black students and certain number of Latino students just isn&rsquo;t true,&#8221; he (Wise) says. &#8220;But the overwhelming majority of white folks in all the research I&rsquo;ve seen believe those lies  &mdash;  believe those myths</p>
<p><br>
Perhaps that isn&rsquo;t true, but should debunking these myths really calm our anxiety? The goal of these folks isn&rsquo;t a certain number, it&rsquo;s to get as many blacks and latinos as possible. Blacks and Latinos seem to feel the same way. There are entire cities now black or Latino. If there is a white city left somewhere you can bet all the sensitive people are doing all they can to end that unpleasant oversight.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t trust any statistic that comes from Tim Wise.  Most of his allegations are so outrageous that they cannot be believed.  What point is he trying to make by putting &#8220;so-called&#8221; in front of racial preferences?  That racial preferences aren&rsquo;t preferences at all?  That there is no discrimination against whites?  </p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet the people who complain about so-called racial preference say nothing about the geographic preferences that actually do work sometimes to the benefit of often-times rural and outlying white folk,&rdquo; Wise says.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of &#8220;geographic preference&#8221; and suspect that Wise made it up on the spot to counter actual discrimination faced by whites but it if does indeed exist then look for the leftists and their government to wage war against it, especially if it benefits the white middle class.</p>

		<p>What?  No story in today&rsquo;s AmRen about Dr. Laura Schlessinger having dropped the &#8220;n&#8221; bomb during one of her radio programs last week?  She must have been suffering from some of that &#8220;white racial anxiety&#8221; when she offered her obligatory apology the next day.</p>
<p>From the censored sound bytes I caught on TV, it seemed like she was making some valid points.  But, of course, to blacks, these were overshadowed by her actual use of the word she was talking about.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Stick it to the white male&#8221; is an excellent shorthand way of understanding the how the diversity ideology translates into admissions policies at elite universities:</p>
<p>&#8220;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wise has no concept of principals. He, (and many others) assumes that if he can convince us &#8220;white trash&#8221; that we are entitled to some type of &#8220;political victim identity status&#8221;, we will support these failed programs.</p>

		<p>Credit Rodriguez and Douthat with not blaming whites for taking their own side in this fight. If the proportions of egalitarians versus conspiracists (pro-affirmative action) is rightly portrayed in the above piece, then there is hope that elite opinion will yield to pressure when push comes to shove over the glaring disparity in treatment between NAMS and the rest.</p>

		<p>I remember  the News coverage of the Jennifer Gatz&rsquo;s case. The day day the Supreme Court decision came out, CBS nightly news had coverage of the reaction on the University of Michigan campus. Young hindu &#8220;American&#8221; women from the student goverment were very vocal in their support of affirmative action for nonwhites. If you ever voted Republican,you voted for the importation of a rapidly growing hostile hindu population in America. This is an indisputable fact. They are not our kind.</p>

		<p>Oh, Mr. Tim Wise.  It&rsquo;s a shame you use your obvious intellect for the sole purpose of apologizing for the white race.  Is there anything that White&rsquo;s have done right in your eyes?  is every single person with light complextion guilty of the systemic and institutional racism that you claim?</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already heard the amazing debate between Mr. Taylor and Mr. Wise, i suggest you seek it out.  It is very interesting.  Two equaly matched intellects with two VASTLY different world-views.  Tim Wise makes it very apparent that he hates his own race&rsquo;s achivements and claims it&rsquo;s due to white supremecy.  If you look up &#8220;apologetic liberal&#8221;, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll see Mr. Wise.  </p>

		<p>It would be more accurate to say that white gentiles of European ancestry are the most underrepresented group at elite universities.  About a third to a half of &#8220;white&#8221; students at Ivy league schools identify as Jewish.  A smaller but still significant number are Arab, Persian, Turkish or other Middle Eastern peoples.  Some students who are half Jewish or other Middle Easterners will also identify as white too, further muddying the waters.  Real European white people are small minority as most elite colleges.  </p>

		<p>The sad fact is that Affirmative action is here to stay for at least another 25 years. The reason being is that the White elite, colleges and univeristies, corporations, the mainstream media and other institutions in America have a vested interest in maintaining the policy.</p>
<p>Simply put, there is money to be made in manipulating racial issues and they are not about to forfeit such a lucrative opportunity. </p>

		<p>Western civilization was founded on white brain power.  Everything else is a bother.  Minorities are guests in white founded societies allowed in by grace.  Whites are being heavily brainwashed to steal from them.  How else that present Western society is massively being invaded by non-whites which will eventually cause it to descend into a third world demise.  This is exactly what happened in the Indus Valley, Greek, Egypt, Roman civilizations.  These whites from the heartland is heavily needed in the colleges.  From them, come the work ethics and innovations not from the blacks and hispanics.  How arrogant and foolish.  </p>

<p>As for PBS what would you say they do that is harmful to the White psyche?  I have noticed that much of their programming is more favorable to multiculturalism and programming our young to embrace it. Also I had many problems with Ken Burns and his &#8220;factual&#8221; Civil War series.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the media&rsquo;s reporting of events exist in order to create &#8216;anxiety&rsquo; in whites in the first place? Or in other words it is &#8216;oppression&rsquo; designed to keep us from talking about violence and discrimination and our dispossession from our own country - or to keep us from not even noticing at all.

		<p>I &#8216;woke up&rsquo; only about five years ago when I took a look around and noticed some of the following things:</p>
<p>1) That I am the only white person to be found throughout a large part of my day in this major urban area that used to be all white 60 years ago.  I feel like such a foreigner sometimes in my own country.</p>
<p>2)  I almost never see any white children anymore, even when I pass through a white area.  All the school children, everywhere, even in white areas, are black, latino or asian.</p>
<p>3)  All my bosses at my various jobs have been non-white and all of those but one was an obvious affirmative action hire due to their extremely low intelligence and ability.  They can discriminate against any white workers as they please.</p>
<p>4)  For the first time, I am actually seriously thinking that my children will HAVE TO learn Spanish just to get a job when they grow up.</p>
<p>5)  I see now there is a glass ceiling against whites in this urban area for most managerial positions in city government depts.</p>

		<p>NPR felt it was obligatory to quote Tim Wise.  But they&rsquo;d never invite Jared Taylor to give an opposing point of view.  It has come to the point where the best broadcast news in America is Russia Today.</p>
<p>Every now and then I get some junk mail from the local NPR station begging for money.  It goes straight into the circular file.  They don&rsquo;t even play classical music anymore.  Too elitist.  Too white.</p>
