			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Markon, Washington Post, August 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department filed another lawsuit against immigration practices by Arizona authorities, saying Monday that a network of community colleges acted illegally in requiring noncitizens to provide their green cards before they could be hired for jobs.</p>
<p>The suit against the Phoenix area Maricopa Community Colleges was filed less than two months after the Justice Department sued Arizona and Gov. Jan Brewer (R) over the state&rsquo;s new immigration law. It also comes as the department is investigating Joe Arpaio, the sheriff in Maricopa County, who is known for tough immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>In Monday&rsquo;s lawsuit, Justice officials said the colleges discriminated against nearly 250 noncitizen job applicants by mandating that they fill out more documents than required by law to prove their eligibility to work. That violated the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, the department said.</p>
<p>The law&rsquo;s anti-discrimination provision &#8220;makes it unlawful to treat authorized workers differently during the hiring process based on their citizenship status,&#8221; said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for Justice&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division. He said the government &#8220;is acting now to remedy this pattern or practice of discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is the latest example of stepped-up enforcement by the department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division, which has been reshaping itself after an exodus of lawyers during the Bush administration. It filed a similiar lawsuit in April against John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.</p>
<p>The lawsuit {snip} filed on behalf of Zainul Singaporewalla, a U.S. permanent resident who was offered a math teaching position at Glendale Community College, part of the Maricopa network.</p>
<p>After filling out a federal form attesting to his immigration status and producing a driver&rsquo;s license and Social Security card, he was told to complete another form with more immigration-related information, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>That form required other documents and his green card. When he couldn&rsquo;t present his green card, the suit said, the college would not process his paperwork and would not let him work.</p>

		<p>I simply do not get the whole &#8220;you may not discriminate based on nation of origin&#8221; bit.  Any moral country would, at the very least, give government jobs to citizens FIRST.  In fact, government jobs, whether federal, state, county/parish or municipal should only go to citizens.  And at that there should be a pecking order, natural born citizens get first shot, naturalized citizens only if no natural borns are available.  Only under extraordinary circumstances, say in the case of a Werner von Braun, should non-citizens be hired and in those cases it should require either legislative or executive (governors or presidents only, no mayors or county managers) approval.  We need foreign born child welfare workers, prison guards, postal clerks, highway workers, train conductors and court employees like we need more cases of STDs!</p>
<p>Immigrants, we are told, contribute to our economic growth.  If that is the case then they certainly do not need to be employed by government, which rarely, if ever, contributes to economic growth.  We have more than enough net-tax consumers and have no need to import more.</p>
<p>On a second note why doesn&rsquo;t the federal government just revoke Arizona&rsquo;s statehood status.  Then the president can fire Governor Brewer and appoint a territorial governor who will rule according to Obama&rsquo;s wishes rather than the wishes of those pesky voters.<br>

		<p>Someone correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but don&rsquo;t legal permanent residents have green cards?  So the issue isn&rsquo;t about Singaporewalla&rsquo;s citizenship, it&rsquo;s about his status as a legal resident of the United States.  Now the federal government is essentially saying that you&rsquo;re <i>required</i> to hire illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Please wake me up when the Obama nightmare is over.<br>

		<p>&#8220;At least 2.2 million migrants will arrive in the rich world every year from now until 2050&#8221;, the United Nations announced in March 2007.</p>
<p>The U.N. dictates to the governments of the Western world, who treat this as a royal decree that they must facilitate.</p>
<p>Arizona is upsetting the program.  The pressure is on Obama to reign in Brewer, before the citizens realize their power.</p>

<p>Mr. Perez is simply watching out for his people.  If we (European Americans) think individuals like Perez, Holder, Honest Ob., etc. care one iota about us, then, we are kidding ourselves.  Sadly, the federal government consists of these Perez and Holder types.  The &ldquo;Tea Party Whites&rdquo; need to become White (European American Supporters) Nationalists.  The &ldquo;Tea Party Whites&rdquo; should realize that the federal government happens to be totally against them.  Time happens to be running out for the &ldquo;Tea Party Whites&rdquo; to realize their dilemma and organize for their race.       <br>

		<p>Make no mistake about it, this community organizer, the incompetent blacks, and the white self-hating sychophants in his administration have some screwy idea that all they have to do is work fanatically toward flooding the country with non-whites from all over the world, and things will automaically improve to their advantage, because the white power base will be neutralized.</p>
<p>As the conservative talk show hosts allege, all this immigration is to get more votes, but it&rsquo;s plain hogwash to even remotely consider that these morons are working so dilligently in order to increase the Democrat voting base.  Anybody that comes in now wouldn&rsquo;t be qualified to vote for years.  It is tribalism they seek above all else, stupidly seeing blacks as being able to become more inclusive in every aspect of society once the society is a mish mash of aliens of one sort or another.  </p>
<p>The fools don&rsquo;t understand that flooding the country with non-whites means they will excel far beyond blacks and blacks will still be at the bottom of the American totem pole, because they are less intelligent, as a group, than ALL THE OTHER RACES.</p>
<p>No matter what these leftist fools do or their black co-horts, blacks will REMAIN in last place.  The damage they do in keeping the borders open, however is immeasurable.</p>
<p>And the more fractious we become, the more certain we are to  erupt into large scale civil conflict that will divide this country along race, politics and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Even Bernanke has given up trying to create the impression we will not go into deep, deep depression.  Street riots will follow, then the situation will become racial, and the armed racial fighting will begin in California between blacks and Hispanics, then spread to the rest of the country, which CANNOT be controlled by the meager&hellip;.by comparison to the armed masses&hellip;.military and police, especially since both organizations will break along lines of race and ethnicity themselves.</p>
<p>Keep in mind ALL OF THIS is being brought to us through the courtesy of the multicults who insisted on &#8220;giving&#8221; away mortgaged homes to third world hordes who couldn&rsquo;t pay for them.</p>
<p>Diversity is not only a weakness it is down right deadly, as we shall see VERY CLEARLY later this year, and especially, the next.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to BOLD the word AUTHORIZED in this sentence, but I think it is a key word in the hiring practices. Also, maybe now these places will start thinking twice about hirees with names like Muhammad, Faisal and,Zainul Singaporewalla..the get what they deserve.</p>

		<p>Maybe this and all the other attacks on Arizona by the Obama administration has nothing to do with immigration. Maybe Obama really hates McCain and is taking it out on McCain&rsquo;s home state of Arizona.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t the end. I see where the ACLU is suing Sheriff Paul Barbeau and Sheriff Larry Devers for doing their jobs. I&rsquo;m glad Arizona has Gov. Brewer and not one of the three wimps who are governors of the other border states (mine included). Perhaps the complaints of Arizona&rsquo;s &#8220;terrible&#8221; law that were turned over to the UN should have been directed at our own government and the harrassment they&rsquo;re dealing Arizona. I call that a human rights violation!</p>

<p>Ever visited California?  Except for a few black americans they are forced to hire to keep the EEOC off their backs virtually every government employee at city, county, state and federal level is some kind of non White immigrant.  Many do not speak enough English to function.</p>
