<h1><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/08/19/qt#235925">Appeals Court Rejects Speech Code</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Inside Higher Education, August 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on Wednesday rejected as unconstitutional several parts of the code of conduct for students at the University of the Virgin Islands. Specifically, the court rejected bans on &#8220;offensive&#8221; speech and on language that causes &#8220;emotional distress,&#8221; finding that such regulations were far too broad, and could easily limit legitimate freedom of expression. The ruling was consistent with other federal appeals courts rulings, which have generally barred public universities from regulating similar categories of speech.</p>

		<p>Let the court say what it likes, universities will simply find less obvious ways to ban &#8220;offensive&#8221; speech.  Marxists feel no need to be constrained by any court rulings that aren&rsquo;t in their favor.<br>

<p>Well, here is a rare moment of sanity in a sociopolitical universe gone floridly psychotic!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, I find any use of speech to promote Marxism or multiculturalism both offensive and the cause of emotional distress. That never stopped such nonsense from being spewed at the universities I have attended, despite their &ldquo;speech codes.&rdquo; After all, these issues and my concerns over them were never even considered in such codes. Thus, neither should such utterances that promote Apartheid or other reactionary solutions to these outrages, be banned. </p>
<p>In fact, prohibitive speech codes that do so, are in of themselves offensive and emotionally distressing to many. So, why allow them?</p>
<p>Kudos and applause to The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Thank God this case went to the 3rd Circuit Court rather than the notoriously left wing 9th Circuit Court.  We can be sure that the now moot ban on speech that causes emotional distress was never enforced when the distressed person was a heterosexual white.  After all, all of the diversity programs, ethnic studies programs, and &#8220;Whiteness studies&#8221; programs do their best to belittle whites and encourage hatred against them.<br>

		<p>Rejected by the court or not, the &#8220;code&#8221; is being and will be enforced by means of peer pressure and intimidation.</p>
<p>If you are a conservative faculty or student and would like to exercise your free speech rights of some taboo issues (like those discussed in &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;) you may basically kiss your academic career goodbye.<br>

		<p>A most excellent ruling by the Court. Now black youth in the sunny isles as well as in the hoods of LA and DC can continue to spout n&hellip;..h as every other word in its sparkling, bon vivant discourse. </p>
<p>As Chairman Mao once declared, in a crafty ploy to catch and slaughter the bourgeoise in his perfect paradise, let a thousand flowers bloom!  Of course today, those flowers are Weed. Another favorite noun of vivacious black &#8220;youth&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Of course sane decisions in the federal courts will be fewer and fewer as Obama repopulates the federal judiciary. If he serves two terms, the incubation stage shall begin of the 2039-2045 holocaust against whites. </p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t need to regulate ANY kind of speech.  If they concentrated on their jobs, and taught the subjects they&rsquo;re supposed to they wouldn&rsquo;t have time to play social engineer.<br>

		<p>The University of Virginia had a massive campaign against discrimination using the slogan &#8220;We will not tolerate intolerance.&#8221;  (Yes, this is not a joke.)</p>
<p>This is a poignant glimpse into the illogical and intolerant ideology of egalitarians and Cultural Marxists.</p>
<p>They say they are for tolerance; they are really in favor of shutting down all debate in favor of Cultural Marxism.</p>
<p>Can you really say egalitarians and Cultural Marxists are tolerant of *real* Christians, conservatives, libertarians, race realists, or patriots?  </p>

		<p>The university at Santa Cruz tried this when I was a student there in the late 1980s.  I was hauled into an office to face the music and told them to eff the effing eff off.  University officials bully what they like to think are children, but the &#8220;kids&#8221; they enjoy intimidating are free, white and 18.  Some of us enjoy firearms and explosives, and know how to follow someone home from work.</p>
<p>When I was told my &#8220;punishment&#8221; would not be official, I read off the woman&rsquo;s home address.  That was the end of the discussion.</p>

		<p>So the universities can&rsquo;t regulate offensive speech, eh? I guess they&rsquo;ll just have to talk PoliSci students into slashing their opponents&rsquo; tires.</p>

		<p>This issue came up over 20 years ago when I was a student at UC Santa Cruz.  University officials there seemed honestly confused about whether the First Amendment to the US Constitution also protected university students.</p>
