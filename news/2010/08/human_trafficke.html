<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38770090/ns/world_news-africa/?GT1=43001">Human Trafficker Jailed for Trying to Sell Albino Man</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fumbuka Ng&rsquo;wanakilala, MSNBC, August 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Kenyan man has been sentenced to nine years in prison for trying to sell an albino man to witchdoctors in Tanzania, local media reported Thursday.</p>
<p>A magistrate&rsquo;s court in northwest Tanzania sentenced 28-year old Nathan Mutei on Wednesday, after he pleaded guilty to charges of human trafficking and abduction with intention to sell an albino man, also Kenyan, for 400 million Tanzanian shillings ($263,000).</p>
<p>At least 53 albinos have been killed since 2007 in the east African nation and their body parts sold for use in witchcraft, especially in the remote northwest regions of Mwanza and Shinyanga, both gold-mining regions where superstition is rife.</p>
<p>The victims&rsquo; blood and body parts are used for potions. Witchdoctors tell their clients that the body parts will bring them luck in love, life and business.</p>
<p>There are around 170,000 albino people, who lack pigment in their skin, eyes and hair, living in Tanzania.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tanzania is due to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in October. The Tanzania Albino Society fears there could be a new wave of killings in east Africa&rsquo;s second largest economy ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>It is common for some politicians to visit witchdoctors during elections in belief that their powers will boost their chances of victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is talk around the country that the entire albino population could be wiped out by the time the general election is over. We don&rsquo;t know whether or not to believe these stories, but albinos are now certainly living in fear,&#8221; Msembo said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In neighboring Burundi, at least 11 albino people have been killed since last year. So far 13 people have been convicted, including one who received a life sentence.</p>

		<p>Kenya, hmm?  Isn&rsquo;t that where Obama is from?  My, how proud he must be of his heritage!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;.we brought blacks, who had been captured by other blacks who then sold them to muslim slave traders, who then sold them to New England sea captains, to our shores.  We then trained them in farming, crafts, manners, and various trades.  We supplied them with better housing than they had where they came from, protected them from each other whenever possible, and clothed them better than they had been.<br>
We gave them Christianity.  And WE are called evil, and 200 years later we are reminded daily that &#8220;we be slaves&#8221; and &#8220;you be evil&#8221;.</p>
<p>Over there, they are still buying blacks (who lack pigmentation) so they can be killed for their body parts and blood TO THIS DAY.  They are still forcing other blacks into slavery over there TO THIS DAY.  They are murdering each other for being from the wrong tribe, or for no reason at all.  TO THIS DAY.  They are starving because they have not learned to farm efficiently, or because they just don&rsquo;t want to work unless forced to.  Rape is a right of passage for young black boys to &#8220;man up&#8221;. And they don&rsquo;t much care if the unlucky girl is their sister, or somebody else&rsquo;s sister.  Pretty much all aid we send is taken by the dictators and corrupt gang leaders and sold to buy guns, drugs, slaves, or even albino body parts for &#8220;luck&#8221;.  Yet we are to celebrate their rich heritage and culture - and OUR blacks invent a bogus heritage linked to imaginary lineage back to Africa our of racial pride.  The White Man is Evil and the Black Man is noble.  Right.  In a sane world that would be laughable.  But we are no longer in a sane world.</p>

		<p>Those kids are praying? In some sort of church run orphanage?</p>
<p>An orphanage run by some foreign group of whitey do-gooders?</p>
<p>They have to be kept separate from the rest of their society or they will be killed and their body parts used for juju? In some parts African black magic is called, juju, other places, muti.</p>
<p>[in this particular instance, the whitey do-gooders are doing good!]</p>
<p> &#8220;I told you that once the glare of the World Cup spotlight would leave the new South Africa, the continent would go back to business as usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>They kept flashing that message at the start of each World Cup game, &#8220;NO racism&#8221;. Seems the only ones that need a lecture about racism are the black Africans themselves.</p>

		<p>The most important thing to pay attention to is the price offered for this human sacrifice.</p>
<p>Africa, supposedly, is poor.  Kenya is supposedly more poor than usual.  Yet, a significant sum by first world standards and a king&rsquo;s ransom by third world standards is offered for one person.</p>
<p>How many ritual sacrifice items can be harvested from this one person?  A couple hundred?  A thousand?  My point is that in order for this to be profitable in relation to the risk (which is a grisly death at the hands of an enraged mob&hellip;.never mind the authorities) each &#8220;muti&#8221; must be fabulously expensive by the standards of the people who live in kenyan and demand must be quite high.</p>
<p>For poor people, they sure do have a lot of money to waste on worthless, heinously evil, ignorant acts.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the stiff penalties against marketing albino parts serves to drive up the price so that abducting/killing them becomes even more lucrative.  It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle and it&rsquo;s a similar dynamic to the war on some drugs that the U.S. government wages.  I do not claim to know the solution but nine years in prison is not enough.  Public executions might succeed in dissuading would-be trafficers.</p>

		<p>I can understand why albinos are so ostracized that people in africa want to kill them for &#8216;mystical&rsquo; qualities.  I was at an airport not too long ago, and a crowd, and I&rsquo;m not making this up, of at least 15 + albino blacks walked by with their luggage.</p>
<p>I did a double and then a triple take as they literally looked like aliens or something.  Here in the West they&rsquo;re safe, but to the eyes of a voodoo practioner, they&rsquo;re dinner and potions.</p>

<p>According to my (White) South African co workers, business as usual never stopped, the MSM is just not reporting it AS USUAL!</p>

		<p>If this was going on in America or Europe or any white nation and they were treating non-white kids this way, Martial Law would imposed.  However, since the victims are white, it doesn&rsquo;t get much coverage or public outrage.</p>
