<h1>Bernice King Breaks Silence, Asks SCLC to End Rift</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Errin Haines, Google News, August 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After nearly 10 months of silence, the Rev. Bernice King urged the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on Tuesday to end the bitter infighting that has split the group she was elected to lead.</p>
<p>King said at a news conference she still plans to lead the civil rights group but declined to say when she would take the post. She has indicated she would wait out the bickering and legal wrangling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shortly after her election in October by a unified SCLC, the leadership of the group co-founded by her father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., split into two factions that have since met and made decisions separately. The SCLC is awaiting a decision from a judge as to which faction controls the group.</p>
<p>As the factions prepare to host dueling conventions in the next week, King says she will lead a prayer vigil for the SCLC on Friday at Ebenezer Baptist Church  &mdash;  where her father preached from 1960 until his death in 1968 and across the street from where her parents are buried.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tuesday, King  &mdash;  who is also a lawyer  &mdash;  said she had originally intended to take office in April but waited because of the ongoing court battle. Meanwhile, King said she has been meeting with her transition team and preparing for her eventual role as head of SCLC.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s has opted to stay out of the fray in the wake of investigations into charges of financial mismanagement by the group&rsquo;s ousted chairman and treasurer. Those allegations are at the heart of the SCLC split.</p>

The sad fate of the SCLC is that their turmoil has taken them out of the shakedown business for so long that they may need to hire outside consultants just to revive the mission and relearn the old tricks.  The consultants will sue them for unpaid invoices, and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Why has Bernice been so slow to act on behalf of SCLC?  Because she pocketed about $10,000,000 when the Atlanta business community was shaken down for $30,000,000 to buy Michael King Rev.&rsquo;s papers a few years ago.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t need the job or hassle.<br>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the group was still around. It figures, fighting over the money. If they revitalize themselves then they can get back into the race racket and extort more money. I suppose they&rsquo;ll be in competition with the other acronym groups for more government largesse, a form of high end welfare for the upper rung blacks. For the rest of you, keep working; the many millions out there need your money.</p>

		<p>As the first poster &#8220;Odinistic&#8221; notes, a number of successful companies like Coca Cola and Home Depot were shaken down into shelling out $32 million for King&rsquo;s plagiarized speeches.</p>
<p>Even worse, the greedy King family retains the copyright so how can the buyers ever turn a profit on their investment? And according to MLK biographer David Garrow the archive is incomplete and only consists of 1% of King&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<p>What a ripoff! <br>

White infighting might lead to schisms but splinter groups are generally strong enough to take on a life of their own.</p>
<p>Black infighting leads to devastation and destruction.</p>
<p>This group has long since lost its&rsquo; alleged civil rights patina and is nothing but about trying to make money off of Kings&rsquo; copyrights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought it was beyond shameless that the alleged most important &#8216;civil rights speech in world history&rsquo; (I Have a Dream) is copyrighted and is not seen as freely belonging to all mankind. Crass and shameless don&rsquo;t begin to describe such actions and motives.<br>

		<p>Aside from the typical black incompetence, nepotism, and infighting, this organization is doomed largely because it&rsquo;s no longer relevant.  The Civil Rights struggle is long over, and blacks have not only equal opportunity, but unequal perks to take into their present-day &#8220;struggle&#8221;.  The SCLC is like a bunch of old Civil War vets still parading around in moth-eaten uniforms during WWI, declaring  &mdash;  either for North or South  &mdash;  that the struggle is not yet over.</p>

<p>That speech was nothing but Marxist dribble to enslave the White masses into believing MLK was a saint and that all men are created equal. That &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221; pertains only to Whites.  Amren has in it&rsquo;s archives much more about this so-called &#8220;good man&#8221; and his speech.</p>

		<p>I think it is about time that the masses be clearly told the whole truth about MLK, form the fact he cheated to write he so-called thesis, to his troubled ideology, etc.</p>
<p>The man was no saint. He was a good public speaker, yes. But he wasn&rsquo;t much more.</p>
