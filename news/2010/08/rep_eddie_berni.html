<h1>Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson Violated Rules, Steered Scholarships to Relatives</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Todd J. Gillman and Christy Hoppe, Dallas Morning News, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Longtime Dallas congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson has awarded thousands of dollars in college scholarships to four relatives and a top aide&rsquo;s two children since 2005, using foundation funds set aside for black lawmakers&rsquo; causes.</p>
<p>The recipients were ineligible under anti-nepotism rules of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, which provided the money. And all of the awards violated a foundation requirement that scholarship winners live or study in a caucus member&rsquo;s district.</p>
<p>Johnson, a Democrat, denied any favoritism when asked about the scholarships last week. Two days later, she acknowledged in a statement released by her office that she had violated the rules but said she had done so &#8220;unknowingly&#8221; and would work with the foundation to &#8220;rectify the financial situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, she said, &#8220;I recognized the names when I saw them. And I knew that they had a need just like any other kid that would apply for one.&#8221; Had there been more &#8220;very worthy applicants in my district,&#8221; she added, &#8220;then I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have given it&#8221; to the relatives.</p>
<p>Her handling of the scholarships puts a rare spotlight on the program and how it is overseen. Caucus members have great leeway in how they pick winners and how aggressively they publicize the awards. Some lawmakers promote the program online, for instance, while Johnson does not.</p>
<p>Philanthropy experts said such lax oversight of scholarship money doesn&rsquo;t match the standards for charities.</p>
<p>The foundation  &mdash;  which is supported by private and corporate donations, not taxpayer money  &mdash;  provides $10,000 annually for each member of the Congressional Black Caucus to award in scholarships. Each gets to decide how many ways to split the money and whether to create a judging panel, choose personally or delegate the task.</p>
<p>Johnson, a former chairwoman of the caucus who has served on the board that oversees the foundation, said she wasn&rsquo;t fully aware of the program rules and emphasized that she didn&rsquo;t &#8220;personally benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The program &#8220;operates on an honor system,&#8221; so the foundation hadn&rsquo;t known that money went to Johnson&rsquo;s relatives, she [Amy Goldson, the foundation attorney] said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is inappropriate for a lawmaker to certify the award of a scholarship to a relative in a situation where the lawmaker or their staff is involved in the selection of the recipient,&#8221; she [Goldson] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson awarded nine to 11 scholarships a year from 2005 to 2008, the most recent years for which information was available. Each of those years, three or four winners were related to her or her district director, Rod Givens. Johnson said she divided the available funds equally among recipients, and every qualified applicant got a scholarship.</p>
<p>The foundation asks applicants to certify that they aren&rsquo;t related to those associated with the caucus or the foundation, but it does not specify which relationships that includes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. proper&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Daniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, said that {snip} Johnson&rsquo;s system &#8220;is not an appropriate or proper way to distribute scholarship funds,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s totally fine if the congressman or -woman wants to reach inside their own pocket and give, but to use money that people got tax deductions on to then benefit their family  &mdash;  it would just be setting up nonprofit organizations to get tax benefits to put their kids through college. It would wreck the whole system if that kind of thing were allowed,&#8221; Borochoff said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson, in the interview Wednesday, dismissed concerns about the propriety of giving to her relatives or her staffers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The congresswoman, 74, who is expected to handily win a 10th term this fall over a relatively unknown Republican, said flatly that there was no favoritism for her aide&rsquo;s children or for her grandsons or great-nephews.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Rules clear, lawyer says</b></p>
<p>The Congressional Black Caucus consists of one U.S. senator and 41 House members  &mdash;  among them Johnson and two other Texans, Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee and Al Green, both of Houston. All are Democrats.</p>
<p>The foundation is a separate, nonprofit charitable organization whose board at any time includes only a few caucus members.</p>
<p>The foundation, which awarded $716,000 to 556 students last year, has been criticized for spending less on scholarships than on galas and conferences that allow lobbyists to rub elbows with influential lawmakers. Fundraising for the caucus itself and its members is tightly regulated, but the closely related foundation faces few restrictions.</p>
<p>In 2002, Johnson chaired the caucus and served on its board.</p>
<p>She continued to serve on the foundation board through 2005  &mdash;  a year when both great-nephews and grandson Kirk Johnson received scholarships through her office, despite a rule explicitly forbidding awards to relatives of foundation board members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;As best I could&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>But the Johnsons, Moores and Givenses weren&rsquo;t eligible under other foundation rules requiring recipients to reside or go to school in a congressional district represented by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
<p>None of the six lived or attended school in Johnson&rsquo;s district. They lived in districts represented by white Republicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even though her grandchildren grew up near Austin, she added, there was nothing untoward about giving scholarships to students outside her district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If there had been very worthy applicants in my district, then I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have given it&#8221; to relatives, she [Johnson] added. &#8220;But, when you have enough money to give one additional scholarship and that person&rsquo;s well-qualified, I have never considered it a violation of anything to give a little help.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Ferris, director of the Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy at the University of Southern California, said most nonprofits seek to avoid even the perception of conflicts of interest by establishing review boards to help make selections on scholarships or grants.</p>

<p><b>AT A GLANCE: FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIPS</b></p>
<p>* In 2009, the foundation  &mdash;  a nonprofit entity that technically is separate from the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of 42 federal lawmakers  &mdash;  gave out $716,000 in scholarships to 556 students. Similar sums were given out in previous years.</p>
<p>* Corporate donors provide most of the scholarship funds.</p>
<p>* The foundation sets aside $10,000 for each member of the caucus to distribute to college students, under the main scholarship program.</p>
<p>* Each lawmaker (or an aide or screening committee of his or her choosing) reviews applications and selects winners. There are no specific judging criteria.</p>
<p>* Each lawmaker can decide how many winners to pick. That determines the size of each award.</p>
<p>* To be eligible, a student must have a 2.5-grade-point average and must live or go to school in a district represented by a member of the caucus.</p>
<p>* Students must certify that they satisfy the residency requirements and aren&rsquo;t related to any caucus member.</td>  </tr></table></div><br>

		<p>Oh, come on now, we all know she didn&rsquo;t know. That should be good enough to get off on this one, I wonder what else she has done that she &#8220;didn&rsquo;t know&#8221;. Black corruption run rampant &#8220;didn&rsquo;t know&#8221; any bounds again.</p>

		<p>I am curious about the nature of the scholarship applicants acceptability to the various institutions if the only GPA requirement is set to 2.5.  My understanding is that anything in the range 2.5-3 is a high C to a low B and those should not be the kind of people we put through higher education, no matter what the color of their skin.</p>
<p>If there is damage to the institution&rsquo;s selection freedoms then there is indeed something wrong.</p>
<p>On the other hand,  I doubt seriously if blacks giving &#8216;corporate donations&rsquo; to their own kids as well as whooping it up at functions and dinners designed to let those very companies whisper little vote wishes in their ear is any different from what whites do.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t get caught as much.</p>
<p>So the real question is what their voting agendas are like and the kinds of legislation that gets passed through the Caucus as a votes-r-us form of vote block advertising.</p>
<p>I seriously wish that someone with some morals would simply pay for quality (4-6 million, 3 term limit) in our national legislatures and then OUTLAW this kind of correlated &#8216;oh but they are on  a /charity/ board&rsquo; crap.</p>
<p>Because corruption isn&rsquo;t worth a damn unless it&rsquo;s by consensus and the only way to remove the temptation from the group as the individual is to make it ANY financial &#8216;assistance&rsquo; illegal with 7-10 year terms for each instance caught.</p>

		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t against &#8220;black rules.&#8221;  Blacks have their own morality that is based upon their weakness for immediate gratification and minimal impulse control, both factors that create all that we know of &#8220;black arts and culture,&#8221; i.e. essentially voodoo fetish.</p>
<p>White Humanity makes a profound and fundamental miscalculation when it assumes that the blacks even understand the rules as written. Whites simply do not comprehend the blacks. We must look at ghetto life and then interpolate that environment as a true expression of the black internal identity, all blacks.</p>
<p>Everywhere blacks aren&rsquo;t living in abject and disgusting ghettos, White Humanity has sacrificed far beyond reason.</p>
<p>Every educated, articulate black got that way because hundreds of Whites were denied their rightful Destinies so that White Money could invest in him through Affirmative Action, Diversity and Inclusion, and Social Justice.</p>
<p>A black will not advance unless White Humanity is restrained and forced to pay for the black&rsquo;s privileges.</p>
<p>Whites suffer when blacks advance, which was the purpose of the Civil Rights Struggle. </p>
<p>If you are White and Happy, then you are living proof that inequality is a shameful burden upon society and demands from us that we &#8220;do more to atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your misery is required before the Civil Rights leaders another claim another milestone on the long march toward Equality. </p>
<p>If blacks breaking the &#8220;White Man&rsquo;s Rules&#8221; means blacks advance while White Humanity freezes or slides, then the rules were just obstacles to the forward march of History.<br>

<p>Outstanding, I should say   &mdash;   That&rsquo;s getting half Cs and half Bs from a ghetto high school.  Meaning that you have a pulse and a few brain cells.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big deal? To the blacks, the reasons for seeking puiblic office are: loot the Treasury, pad the payroll with relatives and friends and pay off supporters while punishing opponents. This practice is not exclusive to blacks, but they will support the crooks with rheir votes more than others. The only fatal mistake is to appear to be insufficiently anti-white. <br>
All the black crooks run on the theme that &#8220;whites are out to get me&#8221;. Works every time! </p>

		<p>The number of scholarships handed out by this corrupt legislator is now over 20. Even the dimmest of politicians knows that such behavior is clearly an ethical and perhaps legal violation. </p>
<p>What is it with blacks in any position of power? It&rsquo;s like the law of the jungle - they feel they can do as they please and apparently think there is nothing wrong in doing so.</p>
<p>In this case it is disgraceful that it went on for so long. </p>
<p>Worse, when blacks complain and whine about not making any &#8220;progress&#8221; this again shows they only have themselves to blame. Since Johnson was going to award the scholarships to blacks anyway she could at least have given the money to the truly deserving. </p>
<p>Instead she passed out the cash to her family like Halloween candy leaving that one black in ten who can benefit from an education out to dry. </p>
<p>What other group would show such blatant disrespect for education? And this from the people who are always screaming about education in the first place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if you expect this horrid behavior from blacks and up until now you didn&rsquo;t give it much thought aside from saying to yourself, &#8220;Typical.&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, the typical period is over. The Beck rally in Washington is the first step in saying enough is enough. </p>
<p>Blacks cry for equality but seem unable to function in the society which they demanded entry. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke but it&rsquo;s no laughing matter.</p>

		<p>A minor, though perhaps significant point, is that when Whites get caught, they usually resign where blacks hang on denying any wrong doing and throwing down the race card and sadly, it usually works and the miscreants remain in office and are usually re elected by the blacks.</p>

		<p>In a sane rational political system, there would be no Black Caucus. You know, the system Madison and Jefferson created. That system was created by wealthy white guys. A good system.</p>
<p>All men are not created equal. Nor women. Jefferson had that principle wrong, but I don&rsquo;t think he really meant it, at least for African slaves and their descendents.</p>
<p>Why are these unqualified students in these universities at all, with or without the congressional slush fund? Because the majority of the American people do want it this way. Because the universities, community colleges and high schools overwhelmingly want &#8220;diversity&#8221; and will dilute standards and misspend money as much as possible to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>We need a totally new education system. We need a new Constitution. The American people overwhelmingly, as it grows darker and less literate, could care less about &#8220;original intent&#8221;.  They (including most whites) are indifferent to, or supportive of, the triumph of diversity and income redistribution, regardless of talent.  The public ignores the futile efforts of Robert Bork,Antonin Scalia, or Clarence Thomas to his credit, to cry out about the destruction of our original constitution by politicians and judges.</p>

		<p>Yeah, all those low GPA&rsquo;s getting college money, and I have a kid with a 5.0 who will probably not get any of that money handed out just because he&rsquo;s white.  Somehow, that just ain&rsquo;t right.</p>
