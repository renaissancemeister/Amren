			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Bresnahan and Jonathan Allen, Politico, August 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The controversy over the cases and the prospect of the first simultaneous ethics trials for multiple members in more than 30 years mark the biggest challenge for the ethics committee&rsquo;s and the House&rsquo;s ability to police its own members since the mid-1990s, when then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and leaders from both parties found themselves hauled before the secretive panel.</p>
<p>The question of whether black lawmakers are now being singled out for scrutiny has been simmering throughout the 111th Congress, with the Office of Congressional Ethics a focal point of the concerns. At one point earlier this year, all eight lawmakers under formal investigation by the House ethics committee, including Rangel  [Rep. Charles Rangel] and Waters [Rep. Maxine Waters], were black Democrats. {snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a &#8220;dual standard, one for most members and one for African-Americans,&#8221; said one member of the Congressional Black Caucus, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel made his own referral to the ethics committee after news reports in 2008 that he improperly controlled four rent-stabilized units in a luxury Harlem building and had used official congressional letterhead to mail donor solicitations for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York. That case later expanded to include Rangel&rsquo;s failure to pay taxes on rental income on a Dominican Republic resort home, failure to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars in income on his annual disclosure form and his intervention on a tax break for a million-dollar donor to the Rangel Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Waters&rsquo;s case was referred by OCE to the ethics committee for further investigation as well, and a special four-member investigative subcommittee has found that the California Democrat violated as-yet-unspecified House rules.</p>
<p>While the Statement of Alleged Violation against Waters has not yet been released, she has been under investigation by the ethics committee regarding reports that she intervened with the Treasury Department during the 2008 banking crisis on behalf of a minority bank in which her husband owned more than $250,000 in stock. The initial probe into Waters&rsquo;s case was launched by OCE, which recommended that she undergo a full investigation by the ethics committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another black lawmaker, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.)  &mdash;  a close Rangel confidant  &mdash;  has been caught up in an ongoing Justice Department criminal probe involving some of Queens&rsquo;s most powerful politicians. Meeks has denied any wrongdoing, and, like Rangel, blamed his problems on the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative watchdog group.</p>
<p>And Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) has come under Justice Department investigation over his role in the Rod Blagojevich scandal. {snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Roland Burris (D-Ill.), the only African-American in the Senate, was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee last November for &#8220;incorrect, inconsistent, misleading or incomplete information&#8221; over his appointment by Blagojevich to Obama&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>Other black Democrats who have found themselves in ethics or legal trouble in recent years include: former Rep. Frank Ballance of North Carolina, who went to federal prison in 2005 after being convicted on federal fraud and money laundering charges; former Rep. Earl Hilliard Jr. of Alabama, who was found by the ethics committee in 2002 to have improperly used campaign funds and Rep. Corrine Brown of Florida, who was investigated but cleared in 2000 over the gift of a car to her daughter and other allegations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In May, Rep. Marcia Fudge, a black Democrat from Ohio, and 19 additional members of the CBC introduced a resolution to rein in the office, created in 2008 as part of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s (D-Calif.) drive to reduce corruption in Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fudge&rsquo;s chief of staff, Dawn Kelly Mobley, was admonished by the ethics committee earlier this year for &#8220;improperly communicating&#8221; with Carib News during the investigation into whether the organization used corporate funds to pay for Caribbean trips by CBC members, including Rangel in 2007-08. The investigation was led Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), a member of the caucus.</p>
<p>&#8220;House Democrats are paying a price for OCE&rsquo;s focus on black lawmakers,&#8221; added a Democratic insider close to House leaders. &#8220;But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that voters are going to see two African-Americans on trial in the House while they see no action against white members with ethical problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The racism charge, though, was rejected by Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an ethics watchdog group, even as she acknowledged the current situation is bound to anger black lawmakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sloan noted that several white lawmakers, including Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) and Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-Ind.), are currently under investigation by federal and congressional investigators. Ensign is being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department over the fallout from an extramarital affair he had with the wife of a top aide, while Visclosky and his former chief of staff are being probed over their ties to a now-defunct lobbying firm raided by the feds last year.</p>
<p>Two other white lawmakers, Reps. Eric Massa (D-N.Y.) and Mark Souder (R-Ind.), resigned this year under ethical clouds. {snip}</p>

		<p>This hardly seems a remarkable development.  When one looks at American national politicians one is observing a group of criminally inclined individuals, who routinely lie, deceive, make shady deals to attract campaign funding and just plain bribes, and in general are drawn from an ethically challenged strata of society. The Founders realized that any political class degenerates thusly and at least gave us a constitution that severely curtailed their ability to do damage.</p>
<p>When you then note that black pols seem more criminally inclined than those of other races, you&rsquo;re just making an observation true of blacks in general - they virtually comprise the criminal class in America.  This is a surprise?</p>

		<p> It is typical that Politico&rsquo;s story suggests, in the very first paragraph, that black legislators are being &#8220;targeted&#8221; more than White ones in ethics probes. The truth   &mdash;   which is that various, and numerous, White legislators have been forced to resign, censured, charged criminally during the last few years, and that their predicaments were reported heavily in the press   &mdash;   is buried way, WAY down toward the end.</p>
<p> It is also typical, of prominent blacks, that they play the race/victim card every time as a diversionary tactic, to muddy the waters. They hope people will not notice how likely black &#8220;leaders&#8221; are to fall afoul of the law, and that instead the public will buy their arguments and blame &#8220;White racism.&#8221; What a transparent, used-up, pathetic tactic!</p>

Do all of these people REALLY think that they should not be held to the same standards as others are? Or are these charges - whether of racism, antisemitism, sexism, or name-your-ism - mere ploys to avoid paying the penalty for their actions?</p>

		<p>The notion that blacks are being attacked unfairly is incredible.  I am using that term in its original, literal and correct sense.  The charge is not to be believed. </p>
<p>AR readers probably need little convincing, but anyone can see that the liberal Democrats are in charge; that to a significant degree they are reliant on the black Democrats to maintain their large majority; that going after blacks is AGAINST THE DEMOCRATS&rsquo; POLITICAL INTERESTS.</p>
<p>To believe that blacks are being treated unfairly one must believe that the liberal white Democrats who run the show are racists and that they persecute blacks without cause even though such action hurts them politically.  No serious person can buy this</p>

<p>There are a lot of crooked white politicians, but, per their percentage of the population, blacks far and away surpass whitey in crookedness.</p>

		<p>When blacks&rsquo; only power was in the ghettos, they regularly fleeced one another, and whites generally ignored them.  Then, after the civil rights revolution, whites usually bent over backwards trying to ignore their fleecing of whites.  Now, many whites are sick and tired of this stance and are demanding a change.<br>
It&rsquo;s amazing to me to see how many black criminals, from the lowliest burglar up to Rangel, behave as though there is nothing condemnatory about their illegal actions.  They behave as though they have a recognized right to take from whitey whatever they can get away with.  They still have the mentality of field slaves who believe it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to steal watermelons and chickens from massa.  <br>
We need to get rid of gerrymandering.  Then the only blacks in state and national office will be those who can impress voters of all ethnicities.</p>

<p>Then he needs to be laughed at and ridiculed for suggesting such a stupid notion that a &#8216;dual standard&rsquo; exists  &mdash;  one for Whites, another for blacks.</p>
<p>Just as a White would be ridiculed, mocked and debased by the national propaganda media if he were to make such a stupid statement without an iota of proof.</p>

I would argue that you people are missing the boat on high crimes and misdeamors.  The most aggregious and largest crimes occured during the TARP bailout.  The most well known was AIG.  James Dimon of JP Morgan sat on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of NY, whose job it was to determine whether or not AIG should be bailed out.  Incidently Dimon&rsquo;s company bought billions of dollars worth of of Credit Default Swaps from AIG.  The government was in a very strong position to negotiate, these companies would have gotten NOTHING without a government bailout.  A situation where the government paid out 60 or 80 cents on the dollar would have very fair and very generous, compared to receiving nothing.  Instead they received 100% bailouts,including Dimon&rsquo;s company JP Morgan.  What a coincidence Dimon sits on the Federal Reserve Bank of NY&rsquo;s board and his company gets a huge bailout from the government on the order of billions of dollars?  Rangel and Water are bit players compared to the professionals.   The sort of crimes that politicans could commit would be trivial in comparison to the sort crimes commited by powerful and well connected financial institutions.  </p>

<p>When will we get our Ethics Hearings for the Atlanta Journal Constitution?</p>
<p>Whenever the perp and victim are black, they post the race description of the perp, but never when the victim is a member of our White Community.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s with the &#8220;black&#8221; description?  Everything else is &#8220;African American,&#8221; and so should the crime reports. If African American gets the credits for being an oppressed minority, then African American should get the debits for criminality, also.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they treat Whites for White Privilege.  We must learn from them.</p>

		<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a &#8220;dual standard&#8221;. They like it like that, and mean to do everything in their power to keep it, too. The only real question is how long Whitey is going to let them get away with it? The way things are going, looks like forever. </p>

		<p>Anyone attempting to paint those with the most ethic problems as hardly ever white will not win a true debate.  Those with power always end up with ethics problems because power corrupts.  The Founding Fathers knew this and attempted to set up a governing system that would be most likely to prevent this problem, and provide tools for continuing the battle against corruption.  There was plenty everywhere in the White world (and elsewhere before the current epic of black presence in U.S. government.</p>
<p>My sister was a California Senator&rsquo;s (a conservative one) secretary for years in the 1970s until his retirement.  I have lobbied for my profession on at the capital.  I have known many people, including former high school classmates who worked at nice restaurants in Sacramento, and later even a some prostitutes who related details of their encounters with elected (and white) Assemblymen and Senators.  Believe me, power does corrupt.  I think the main difference is that blacks, and other minorities have the view that they are there to represent their own racial or ethnic group where whites have usually been the most color blind.  They have a culture of &#8220;sticking it to the man&#8221; even when they get into office.  They seem to excell in short, very short term goals, like the drive to a basketball hoop.  They seem to have cultural (and perhaps a natural) tendancy to grab what they can while they can because they don&rsquo;t really believe their present success is permanent.  Let&rsquo;s hope that last idea is true.</p>

<p>No description of perp!  He wore a ski mask. No mention of gloves.  Black hands?  Black eyelids?  No mention.  Mike Morris at AJC has disturbing weakness for not telling us that blacks are perps.</p>

		<p>What this illustrates is that the high crime rate for Blacks isn&rsquo;t about class, or income level, as is often argued by Liberals.  It&rsquo;s simply about being Black.  And whatever level of social-ecconomic stratum Black criminals happen to be, they all cry &#8220;racism&#8221; when they have to answer for their misdeeds.  They do that because it works.  And it will continue to work for them as long as Whites fail to ask the simple question.  Why are you people in trouble all the time, no matter how well off you are?  Look at the percentage of criminals among Black-dominated professional sports.  Look at the percentage of discipline problems in schools that have a mixed race.  Look at any workplace that keeps accurate records on attendance and work performance.  Insted of playing defence against charges of racism, Whites need to start asking Blacks why it is they&rsquo;re so disfunctional.</p>
