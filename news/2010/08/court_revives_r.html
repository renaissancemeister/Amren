			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John O&rsquo;Brien, Post-Standard (Syracuse), August&nbsp;8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s 1980, a dozen years after American cities erupted in race riots.</p>
<p>In Syracuse, there&rsquo;s outrage over black-white disparities: Just 1 percent of the city&rsquo;s firefighters are black  &mdash;  far less than the 10 percent in the city&rsquo;s labor pool.</p>
<p>Syracuse is among the first cities to find a remedy. City leaders go to court and file a document that makes it OK for them to hire contrary to the law, by picking black firefighters and police officers who score lower than whites on civil service exams.</p>
<p>The document is essentially a license to racially discriminate, with justification. A federal judge in Syracuse says it is a means of guaranteeing &#8220;that America&rsquo;s promise of freedom and equality is more than just a dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirty years later, that document, called a consent decree, is at the center of a civil rights lawsuit against the city. It&rsquo;s been blocking David Vivenzio, Scott Wilkinson and John Finocchio from their lifelong dream of becoming a professional firefighter. They say the time has come to get rid of it.</p>
<p>The fire department now has 59 black firefighters, or 16.6 percent of the 355 total.</p>
<p>A federal judge in 2008 threw out the lawsuit, but an appeals court last month overturned that decision and revived it in a lower court in Syracuse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Such decrees are being thrown out across the country, as are other affirmative action policies, said University of Michigan law professor Richard Primus. The movement stems from a Supreme Court that&rsquo;s become increasingly intolerant of any form of race-conscious decision-making by government, Primus said.</p>
<p>In 2007, the court struck down a quota requirement for the number of black and white students in Seattle&rsquo;s public high schools. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a line that could be the battle cry for the anti-affirmative action side: &#8220;The way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a flip side to that argument, said Primus, a leading expert on employment discrimination law whose work the Supreme Court has cited.</p>
<p>Both sides are working to figure out what the Syracuse labor pool looked like when the 2005 lawsuit was filed. Five years earlier, it was 21 percent black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city has asked the appeals court to reconsider the case, with the entire panel hearing arguments instead of only three judges.</p>
<p>The two sides are tussling over the language of the 1980 decree. It lays out two goals for the city: blacks should make up 10 percent of each rank in the department, and the percentage of blacks in the department should match the percentage of blacks in the Syracuse labor pool.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decree is an important tool in recruiting black firefighters  &mdash;  especially with the department losing some of its African American members to retirement, Fire Chief Mark McLees said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a constant effort to maintain a diverse fire department,&#8221; McLees said. &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t happen by itself. Just this year, two African American firefighters are retiring. That&rsquo;s a number that affects the whole percentage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed five years ago by Vivenzio, Wilkinson, Finocchio and nine other white applicants who were denied jobs as firefighters because of the consent decree.</p>
<p>Six of them were hired a year later and three others dropped out of the case. The city&rsquo;s lawyers said in court papers that the department didn&rsquo;t hire Vivenzio and Wilkinson because their civil service scores of 95 were too low  &mdash;  although higher than the African Americans who were hired. The department didn&rsquo;t hire Finocchio despite his score of 105 because he did not reveal that he had a driving-while-ability-impaired conviction 15 years earlier, court papers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The legal battle comes down to an interpretation of the decree&rsquo;s intended goals. Here&rsquo;s the language from the 1980 decree:</p>
<p>&#8220;The city desires to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. achieve the long-term goal to utilize blacks in all ranks within the fire and police departments in numbers approximating their representation within the labor force,&#8221; the decree said. &#8220;Subject to the foregoing sentence, the parties agree that the long-term goal for blacks in each rank is approximately 10 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goals of the decree have not been met in Syracuse&rsquo;s Police Department, where 7 percent of the 489 officers are black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fennell wants the city to reassess the need for the decree. The state police were under a similar consent decree in the 1980s and they put on a statewide push to hire black troopers, he said. When they hit the decree&rsquo;s goal soon afterward, the agency went back to court and got the decree terminated, Fennell said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the decree&rsquo;s original intent is still needed, Johnson said. That&rsquo;s especially true because many of the African Americans hired 20 years ago are starting to retire, he said.</p>

		<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m all for diversity.  Let&rsquo;s let majority black neighborhoods have their own fire departments.  They can affirmative action them as much as they want.  Majority white neighborhoods can have their own departments to do with as they please.  Any neighborhood without a majority of any race can choose which departments serve them or try to set up a numerically *correct* department.</p>
<p>Then let&rsquo;s compare the success rates of those departments.  Of course there is a reason this won&rsquo;t happen: even those judges ordering affirmative action know they still need whites there to pick up the slack, so everything must be &#8220;integrated&#8221;.  Look at what happens to the black-run hospitals, schools, and cities.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile in inner city firehouses that are almost all black, there&rsquo;s a curious silence. Or there would be, if they weren&rsquo;t busy celebrating their &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, seemingly as job one. It has &#8216;extra-special&rsquo; meaning for them.  </p>

		<p> Firefighters of Color United in Syracuse?! In other words, not only are blacks given a special, lower threshold for competency in order to get hired, than White applicants, but they&rsquo;re allowed to form an exclusive, non-Whites only organization once they&rsquo;re in! Maybe there&rsquo;s some planet in the Universe where that makes sense, but it doesn&rsquo;t on Earth!</p>
<p> I agree with Chief Justice Roberts: &#8220;The way to stop discriminating by race, is to stop discriminating by race.&#8221; It sounds like White applicants Vivenzio, Wilkinson and Finocchio were victims of just that   &mdash;   racial discrimination. The city of Syracuse can torture logic and language all it wants to in trying to justify this determination to push the percentage of black firefighters higher and higher, but Occam&rsquo;s Razor says this is really just bald racism, applied against White men.</p>

		<p>Having once worked in a pure affirmative action environment, I can attest to the absurdities it brings forth.  Low-level white employees with high school educations having to EXPLAIN THE VERY MEANING OF COMMONLY-USED WORDS to supposedly &#8220;college-educated&#8221; black supervisors&hellip;and the examples abound from there!</p>

		<p>Can we be honest here?  Blacks are woefully behind whites on average in IQ (and something more nebulous, but just as real, their emotional maturity).  Without government help to get into jobs and schools, blacks on average cannot make the grade.  <br>
But everytime the government chooses an inferior black for a career job or for a place in a classroom, the white guy who deserved that place gets screwed.<br>
He did nothing wrong.  He studied when he could have been playing basketball or baseball or watching TV.  And the black who may be barely literate beat him out, all because of skin color.  Hard to blame the white guy for being bitter.<br>
Affirmative Action isnt fair.  And it needs to stop.</p>

		<p>Because of the vast media enterprise that exists in the world today, meaning limitless reporting and interpretation of issues once sacred cows to the mainstream media and their one sided analysis, it&rsquo;s obvious that public opinion has been altered to reflect the changes which have transpired in our world.</p>
<p>Since Obama entered into office, never has it been so transcending about minorities and the reality of affirmative action, shifting from a grand notion to an abstruse interpretation of true equality.</p>
<p>Yes, times have changed. Everyone wants a job now. There&rsquo;s over three hundred million in the US, compared to something like one hundred seventy million (as in my younger days) back in the Sixties. With illegal immigration blazing in the headlines, the influx of countless thousands entering the country legally from foreign lands each year, and the abysmal economic conditions the nation is facing &mdash; not including the loss of so many industries, and the abuse of government aid, it&rsquo;s time to reconsider the entire spectrum of civil rights laws. For now, court battles like this are the means to such reconsideration.<br>

		<p>Is there any evidence that Blacks study as hard in school as Whites or Asians? Is there any evidence that they have the same work ethic? Is there any evidence that they are even capable of meeting the standards that Whites put in place? No.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that Blacks want what Whites have without having to do what Whites have to do to get it.</p>

<p>When exactly did the Civil Rights Movement change from equal opportunity for all to forced equality for mentally inferior blacks?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer to Robert&rsquo;s question:  Since the very beginning.    Prior to 1964/1965, there had already been enormous piles of easily available, bullet-proof, scientific evidence compiled that clearly proved that these Communist originated ideas of &#8216;egalitarianism&rsquo; and the &#8216;equality of all human races&rsquo; were nothing more than baldfaced, devious lies and wishful thinking. </p>
<p>However, since the objective of the Cultural Marxist Communists was to weaken, break down, and destroy White Western Civilization - the biggest obstacle to achieving this goal was the natural talents, ingenuity and productivity of White Western people. </p>
<p>The Cultural Marxists are not stupid; they know the real score when it comes to racial realities.   And, that is why they decided that productive, talented, highly productive and efficient whites (white males, most especially) had to be somehow removed or have roadblocks placed in front of them - in order to allow the less talented, less productive, less intelligent minorities to jump over them and take their places in as many areas of employment as possible.   Since the mid-1960s, it has been a non-stop war being waged on whites and white males, and disenfranchising white men from all walks of life is Prime Objective Number One.  </p>
<p>I ask my fellow AR readers to look over their shoulders, survey what has happened to the productivity and prosperity and efficiency of Western civilization here in America since the passage of the Civil Rights Act?  Are things better or worse?</p>
<p>Survey what has happened to the quality of education in our public schools since the forced integration of them occurred?  Are the academic standards better or worse?   In fact, I seriously doubt that anyone could pick any area of our society today, and compare it to that same area of our society in the 1950s or before - and with a straight face, tell us that today is better.    </p>
<p>Diversity is a strength, is what the Cultural Marxists tell us?  Oh yea?  Then why has America declined in every conceivable area that one might measure, as we got more and more &#8216;diverse&rsquo;?   </p>
<p>The truth is this:  Diversity is a weapon of the Cultural Marxist left and it&rsquo;s purpose is to destroy White Western civilization and to justify waging open warfare on white males, the architects of Western civilization.  </p>
<p>So, the next time anyone tries to spring that &#8216;Diversity is a strength&rsquo; line of baloney on you, tell them the truth - that I just outlined above.    </p>

		<p>In the mid 20th Century, many people could have conceivably believed that blacks had just never been given a chance to show that they could succeed at jobs historically denied them.  After it became obvious that many would NOT succeed or that whites would still best them in positions that called for top scores, affirmative action and quota systems came about.  Such perks have obviously resulted in lowered expectations, white resentment, and lack of motivation and frustration on the part of many blacks.  </p>

<p>Thats a pdf file so I hope that it opens. It shows how it was systematically implemented in the schools years ago, the year I was born.</p>
<p>Affirmative action put this foolish clown in office. The guilt that the Young Whites possess is astounding. They have totally adopted this insipid and repulsive culture of the blacks, because in their eyes, as they have been taught at an early age, Whites are the perpetrators of all the worlds evils. When in fact without the Whites this world would be Hell on Earth.</p>

		<p>Affirmative action hurts blacks as much as it hurts whites. I will not go to a black doctor, for instance, because I do not know if this doctor got into medical school because s/he studied hard, or got an easy pass due to AA. Were some of these doctors fine doctors  &mdash;  oh assuredly, but who wants to take the chance with their or their children&rsquo;s health and/or very lives? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that different from thousands of other white people who feel the same way. Multiply that by the hundreds of occupations and specialities that incompetant blacks get into due to AA and that are then shunned by whites, and you can see that this lessening of standards is not good for ANYONE. The only way to put an end to this is to totally shun ANY and ALL black practioners, till it becomes very clear to them that this AA is cutting off their noses to spite their faces. There are enough intelligent blacks out there to eventually see the light.  </p>

		<p>Clearly, in the name of diversity this should be carried to its logical conclusion, to wit, all trades, occupations, and professions in America should have at minimum thirteen percent black participation.  Aeronautical engineering, medicine, banking, all the sciences, teaching, manufacturing, commercial and military pilots, and retail operations should be covered by this requirement.  At the same time the total US prison population should be reduced to a maximum of thirteen percent blacks.  Those released could immediately find employment in all the afore-mentioned fields.  Only then will America begin to live down its racist past. </p>

		<p>Yes, I once taught that there were no racial differences in intellectual ability. But that&rsquo;s what I had been taught in graduate school.</p>
<p>Also, virtually all the textbooks say there are no such racial differences. But, when you look at the research reports, virtually all of them say that those differences are there and they are not getting smaller.</p>
<p>I once saw a black woman apply for a position for which she lacked the credentials. However, the company wanted to increase diversity so they created a special position for her. (They still had to hire someone with credentials for the original position.)</p>
<p>You have to jump through hoops at my place to hire a white man. You have to show that there is no qualified black or Hispanic, which is usually the case. So we end up hiring white men (and women) anyway.<br>

		<p>To poster #20, you&rsquo;re so right!</p>
<p>I teach in an urban environment where whites are only about 25-30% of the population.  The population of EVERY school is Hispanic/Black and Asian, even in the few white neighborhoods that are left. (The few white kids often go to private schools).</p>
<p>Funny thing is, nearly 90% of the teachers are white, and this goes for new hires, year after year.  The barrier of education credentials is still operating as it should, weeding out substandard applicants.  (This is a job where you have to know certain things, for crying out loud, and this implies the ability to read, study and synthesize on a high level.)</p>
<p>There has been some Affirmative Action assaults but it is mostly as the Admin level.  This is funny, because the minorities are not smart enough, generally, to be teachers, but they can be put in positions of authority because it doesn&rsquo;t require as much rigor or coursework.</p>
<p>Now it is common in my urban area to see an almost all white teaching force with an almost all non-white leadership and support structure.  And the admins are the ones who get the big bucks.</p>
<p>A big downside, among many, is that these minority admins oppress the white teachers when DeQuan and Shanita can&rsquo;t read, no matter how hard many teachers have tried to get them to.  The call is still going forth that they need &#8216;teachers like them&rsquo; to inspire them to study, and there have been programs to dumb down the requirements to get more non-whites into the teaching force.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, the minority teachers either leave after 1-2 years or are - get this - PROMOTED to leadership positions!  By the way, Oriental teachers are almost never seen, because the blacks and latinos ARE SO RACIST against them as to be obscene!  Another issue that is never addressed in our multicultural wonderland. </p>
