<h1>Maine Ballot Initiative Seeks to Extend Vote to Legal Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Douglas Kennedy, FoxNews, August 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Will] Everitt is from the Maine League of Young Voters, a group that&rsquo;s sponsoring a ballot initiative to give non-citizen legal immigrants the right to vote in Portland City elections. &#8220;They&rsquo;re sending their kids to our schools,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And they should be able to have a right to vote for say the school committee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Portland is a city of 65,000 and currently has about 10,000 legal non-citizen immigrants, mostly from African nations like Somalia.</p>
<p>One of the petition-signers is Alfred Jacob, who came to Maine from the Sudan in the mid-90&rsquo;s. For eight and a half years he worked jobs and paid taxes but had no say in how Portland city government spent his tax money. &#8220;I had no say whatsoever,&#8221; he said earlier this week as he walked past the sites of some of his former jobs including a restaurant and a museum. &#8220;I was not part of the process at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everitt calls that a blatant case of taxation without representation and he says it&rsquo;s clearly not fair. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not fair because these people are here legally,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They&rsquo;re living in our community .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they should have a say in how their tax dollars are being spent.&#8221; He says the whole point of the initiative is to make Portland more democratic.</p>
<p>Anti-immigration activists contend it will make it less so. &#8220;It devalues democracy,&#8221; says Bob Dane. &#8220;And in a way, it&rsquo;s watering down the very thing immigrants want the most, and that is the gift of American citizenship. &#8220;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Handing out instantaneous voting rights,&#8221; says Dane, &#8220;to people who still have not taken the requisite citizenship exam, is really just demeaning citizenship and it&rsquo;s setting us back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everitt disagrees. &#8220;I think this is all about democracy, &#8221; he says. &#8220;This is about diversity and I think diversity equals democracy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It seems the agenda is to make citizenship meaningless. What is the purpose of being a citizen if aliens will have all the same rights? If this law passes, it will spread from state to state and then be extended to illegals. </p>

		<p>Trying to get citizens to feel they have something worthwhile to vote for is already a hard sell. Why bother extending the vote to resident non-citizens? The only reason would be for some demagogue to pander to them on some single issue. As if the vast majority of these resident aliens would have any real idea of what they might be doing in a voting booth trying to use a ballot that has no pictures.      </p>

		<p>Taxation without representation happens all the time. People can own property in other counties or states from where they reside, and they are not allowed to vote there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a citizen from a family that can trace its roots in this country back almost 400 years. I owned property in both another state and another county, and I paid taxes on those properties, but I was not allowed to vote there. I was taxed, but I had no vote. There are probably hundreds of thousands of people in that same situation.</p>
<p>People who get caught up in that old Revolutionary War sound bite, just show how stupid they are.</p>

		<p>Next, it will be &#8220;democracy demands diversity!&#8221;</p>
<p>Read William Gayley Simpson- he makes the case the White Civilization will not survive democracy.  We aren&rsquo;t surviving Diveristy.  You know what happens when democracy and diversity join together against us, don&rsquo;t you?</p>

		<p>One would think that given the evidence of the past thirty years the utterly illogical and specious argument that diversity in racial and ethnic relations yields a positive social result would have died a well-deserved death.  Yet this ninny Everitt continues to trumpet this absurd falsehood, clearly because he&rsquo;s a Democrat who wants their votes.</p>
<p>Racial and ethnic diversity is potential trouble - too much is pure social poison.</p>

		<p>Diversity does NOT equal democracy. The old Soviet Union is a salient example of this. It had dozens of diverse races and ethnicities living within its borders, and was pulled apart like taffy, even after the collapse of communism.</p>

<p>By this logic, illegal aliens with kids in school should be allowed to vote as well.  And I&rsquo;m sure Everitt would have no problem with that at all.</p>

		<p>Wait a second, of Portland&rsquo;s 65,000 population, 10,000 are immigrants, mostly from Somalia???  That can&rsquo;t be right.  The 2000 census found Portland to be over 90% European American.  Maybe they mean all of Cumberland County? </p>

		<p>I would vote against the ballot initiative, but I am glad that this issue is being decided by ballots, and not by a judicial ukase.  </p>

		<p>What a great idea. Give Somalis,the most dysfuntional and least self-reliant people on earth, a vote in a state founded by English and French people who carved civilization from a harsh wilderness and from an often fatal sea. Maine has inexorably over the past 40 years become more and more like Massachusetts, from which Maine was carved in 1820.</p>
<p>Perhaps the two states, along with Vermont, should reunite, and secede.  Cuba could send experts to help them set up the &#8220;socialist democracy&#8221; that these betrayers of the great traditions of all three states so obviously crave. </p>
<p>Indeed, with its still large uninhabited areas, Maine could simply absorb the entire population of Africa within its area. Then it could change its name to &#8220;Maine, the AIDS State&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The left&rsquo;s real goal here is to make citizenship absolutely valueless.  What happens when the rest of us agree that US citizenship is, in fact valueless?</p>
<p>I could renounce my citizenship and still spend six months out of every year right here in the US without having to pay any income taxes at all; why should the hyper-wealthy have all the fun in this respect?</p>

		<p>Could Everitt please quote the data that supports the notion that this population in any way contributes to a net positive with regard to the flow of $$$ in the federal, state, or local tax base?  I challenge him or anyone else to honestly collect income and tax information from this population.  Guess what; it&rsquo;s going to be a net negative.  Stop pandering to people who should simply thank God for being here.  Shut up and do something to erase the trade deficit, the budget deficit, or your emotional deficit.<br/>
