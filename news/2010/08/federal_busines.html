<p>Interestingly, these first five categories could, with a bit of imagination and a little alteration, be confused with pornographic media titles.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, this nonsense yet again has its roots in the 60s and 70s. Native Americans and &ldquo;Islamic&rdquo; blacks figured out that their alien religion in the case of the former and their fabricated one in the case of the latter, could be used to gain special &ldquo;rights&rdquo; and force prison administrations to grant them. It is the typical mindset of the antisocial deviant to do such, as it allows them to manipulatively exercise power over others and circumvent &ldquo;the man&rsquo;s system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughably, many groups like the Aryan Brotherhood (ABs) have started playing the same game, and demand the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to worship Odin and seek Valhalla through foolish hybrids of Nordic paganism. This is much to the dismay of &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; prison officials and &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; religious staffers, who just can&rsquo;t fathom why the courts back such &ldquo;racist&rdquo; folly up.</p>
<p>Might that not be answered with a similar question, often isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;Red Road&rdquo; best not taken?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Well, in all fairness Christian, Jewish, and Muslim inmates can have their spiritual needs attended to by a priest, minister, rabbi, or imam, so I don&rsquo;t find it shocking that some of those American Indians who wind up in prison would want a medicine man.</p>
<p>It may seem a bit goofy, but there are vastly more egregious wastes of my tax dollars carried out by the federal government.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have any objections to prisoner&rsquo;s practicing their religions. But prisons should not be required to <i>accomodate</i> them. It is prison after all. The disturbing aspect to this story is that it sounds like the GOVERNMENT is actually hiring some kind of &#8220;medicine man&#8221;. Where are all the liberals screaming &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221; on this one?</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t the 1971 Attica Prison riots start because some black Muslim inmates charged that the prison refused to allow them to practice their religion?</p>
