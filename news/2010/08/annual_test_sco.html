			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Blume, Los Angeles Times, August 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite thousands of teacher layoffs and shrinking school budgets, Los Angeles Unified, the state&rsquo;s largest school system, posted gains on annual standardized tests. Schools statewide also posted overall gains in results released Monday.</p>
<p>The rising scores brought generally good news concerning various reform efforts underway in L.A. Unified, including at Locke High School and at 12 schools overseen by L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Schools still under direct district control also showed gains, some of them larger than the higher-profile efforts touted as superior to what the district could accomplish.</p>
<p>As in past years, the local and statewide gains are incremental. For the most part, low-performing schools are still low-performing and vast achievement gaps remain between low-income black and Latino students and their white and Asian counterparts. Black students are faring the worst.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black students in California improved their proficiency rates but remain the lowest-scoring racial group, with 32% proficient in math and 39% proficient in English.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been unsuccessful in narrowing the achievement gap as much as we really have to,&#8221; said Deb Sigman, the state&rsquo;s deputy superintendent of schools. &#8220;We must do a better job.&#8221;<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but the only thing the above tells me is that there is more cheating going on by teachers, or standards have been lowered or altered in order to get higher scores.</p>
<p>L.A. is especially corrupt, but cheating goes on all over the country sporadically.  The left wing crazies are capable of altering any grade system or tests to get the grades and scores they want.</p>

		<p>If LA&rsquo;s &#8216;improvements&rsquo; are anything like those in NYC, they are due to the following factors:</p>
<p>1)  Very dumbed-down tests.<br>
2)  White liberal teachers who are VERY easy graders.<br>
3)  Outright fraudulent action on the part of Admins<br>
4)  A LOT of teaching to the test and test prep, and little enrichment</p>

		<p>My concern is for the white students.  Have they learned on their own or from parents or friends not to follow black people into failure?  Are they trying their best and getting the encouragement they need or do they already have the attitude &#8220;as long as I&rsquo;m not doing as bad as black people everything is ok?&#8221;</p>

		<p>So they&rsquo;ve lobotomized the curriculum to make <i>everybody</i> score higher, but the blacks and mestizos still can&rsquo;t catch up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same old story, every couple of months, each time in a new place.  You&rsquo;d think that even governmedia flunkies like &#8220;Howard Blume&#8221; would start to notice the pattern here.  Certainly the rest of us out here in flyover country are catching on quite nicely.<br>

&ldquo;We have been unsuccessful in narrowing the achievement gap as much as we really have to,&rdquo; said Deb Sigman, the state&rsquo;s deputy superintendent of schools.</p>
<p>If you read that closely it is almost an admission that IQ differences exist among the races. The key word is &#8220;narrowing.&#8221; </p>
<p>If, as liberals state, there is no difference whatsoever among blacks and whites then the quote should read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been unsuccessful in ELIMINATING the achievement gap as much as we really have to,&rdquo; said Deb Sigman, the state&rsquo;s deputy superintendent of schools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what does &#8220;as much as we really have to&#8221; mean? How much is enough? That&rsquo;s like saying &#8220;as much as is possible considering the fixed 15-20 point IQ difference.&#8221; </p>

		<p>These periodic announcements of improvement of this subgroup or that in education standardized tests are meaningless.  The tests don&rsquo;t measure what students know about customs and manners of Western civilization over the past ten thousand years, they don&rsquo;t measure math ability by sheer reason since calculators are used for math problems, and the tests continue to be diluted by the elimination of expository or persuasive writing sections. Moreover few school systems employ writers or English teachers who are apt writers and masters of grammar themselves.</p>
<p>A better test would be to have spot inspections by traditioally trained math and English teachers of the classroom, combined with questions on the spot to the young scholars of what they are learning at the moment and why and how they respons the way they do. &#8220;I dunno&#8221; would be marked as an incorrect answer. Also any student plugged into a MP3 type device or attached in any way to a cell or smart phone would likewise fail for year.</p>
<p>Another way to measure whether these cellular masses occupying expensive public space ought to be allowed to continue to breathe oxygen in public spaces, or be allowed to graduate any high school in the United States, would be ask them to explain in five paragraphs, well-written, diverse in description and diction(pun, diverse!) and demonstrative of mastery of US History and social thought, of why the phrase &#8220;all men are created equal is utter nonsense&#8221;. That&rsquo;s right: why the phrase IS utter nonsense. </p>
<p>Grading and evaluation of course to be done by non-residents of the state where test is done and by non-residents who are neither federal bureaucrats,public school teachers, consultants nor officials.</p>

		<p>Have a care people.  Hispanics are not blacks.  They have a very intimate family environment, supplying many of the directed learning experiences whites used to, from both parent and grandparental levels in huge households, to their very youngest.</p>
<p>This stimulates active minds, no matter what later happens in their tween/teen years.</p>
<p>Hispanics are also slow to follow a herd path but tend to &#8216;get it right&rsquo; more often once they have committed to a given course.  Which means if they notice their little Juans and Rosalitas are doing poorly in school &#8216;because of X factor&rsquo; they will undertake to act upon it.  Whereas blacks may not even show up to hear about it.</p>
<p>-Some- Hispanics are inhibited by language and background.  -Many- have cultural and family expectations which can tend to dwarf any belief in a higher educational achievement.  But their intelligence norms are closer to white than black IQs and their TFRs (particularly in California, 4.4 at one point) -dwarf both-.<br>
A worrying trend in teen illegitimacy also supports rapid cohort building and narrow overlaps which means huge workforce and voter group entries on much shorter &#8216;wave&rsquo; driven basis than ours.</p>
<p>OTOH, where white elites who could expect to go to college on pure brains from both above and below (i.e. parents pay for it, student earns good loans on GPA) are themselves a small proportion of our culture, the majority are those who are NOT 15-20 points above the hispanic mean but rather only about 5-10.</p>
<p>Those people will struggle at college like anyone else in the 97-103 range, they will not have all the AA bene&rsquo;s that other races accrue.  And so they will most likely either choose not to go at all.  Or to fail within a year, as many other race groups do.</p>
<p>This places them square in the middle of a competitive job group wage-dominated by hispanics who are also very network savvy.</p>
<p>As the pace of any army is set by the slowest marcher, we must avoid the temptation to compare our elites to other group&rsquo;s norms.  Or those norms will swarm our own base population and create the very social inequities that do in fact undermine our society as a whole, just like blacks always scream about.</p>

		<p>&#8221;.&rsquo;..The tests don&rsquo;t measure what students know about customs and manners of Western civilization over the past ten thousand years&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That is because the customs, mores and manners of Western Civilization are not only not taught in the government schools, they are scorned, mocked and vilified.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you know that Western Civilization is one of slavery, colonialism, genocide, spread of disease, oppression of people of color and theft of native lands (strictly perpetuated by Whites, of course)?</p>
<p>Are you not aware that Western Civilization was built upon the backs of downtrodden, enslaved &#8216;natives&rsquo;?  That the Whites who created Western Civilization forced people of color into poverty by stealing their wealth, land and inventions and continue to keep them oppressed to this day?</p>
<p>This is all due to Unearned White Privilege which must be STOPPED!</p>
<p>This is what is being taught in a modern American K-12 government school.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Moreover few school systems employ writers or English teachers who are apt writers and masters of grammar themselves&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What would it matter, especially in a place such as Los Angeles, where the school population is overwhelmingly brown or black (10.8% black, 74.2% hispanic) with attendant IQs in the 80-90 range?  Most of that particular demographic tops out around third grade in reading and math because that is about as far as their innate abilities take them.</p>
<p>Standardized tests have been repeatedly dumbed down, especially the math sections which measure easily taught math concepts, not math application.</p>

		<p>One study I would like to see is how white test scores are suppressed by having to be taught at the same pace/level as the minority under-achievers.  </p>
