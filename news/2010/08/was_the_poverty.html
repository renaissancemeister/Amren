<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The usual development conversation about determinants of per capita income revolves around modern choices of institutions or economic policies. But what if history is the main determinant of development today?</p>
<p>A paper by Diego Comin, Erick Gong, and myself was just published in the American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics. We collected crude but informative data on the state of technology in various parts of the world in 1000 BC, 0 AD, and 1500 AD.</p>
<p>1500 AD technology is a particularly powerful predictor of per capita income today. 78 percent of the difference in income today between sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe is explained by technology differences that already existed in 1500 AD  &mdash;  even BEFORE the slave trade and colonialism.</p>
<p>Moreover, these technological differences had already appeared by 1000 BC. The state of technology in 1000 BC has a strong correlation with technology 2500 years later, in 1500 AD.</p>

<p>&#8220;History&#8221; seems to be this brief article&rsquo;s dainty way of saying &#8220;race.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;1500 AD technology is a particularly powerful predictor of per capita income today. 78 percent of the difference in income today between sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe is explained by technology differences that already existed in 1500 AD &mdash; even BEFORE the slave trade and colonialism&hellip; Moreover, these technological differences had already appeared by 1000 BC. The state of technology in 1000 BC has a strong correlation with technology 2500 years later, in 1500 AD.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And what races are responsible for those &#8220;technological differences?&#8221;  Why, the same ones   &mdash;   Whites and blacks   &mdash;   who were responsible for the technological differences of 1000 BC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a short leap of logic to see that <i>race</i> was and is the determinant factor.  We can at least hope the authors of this paper realize that, and are expecting their readers to draw the obvious conclusions without their having to state it openly.<br>

		<p>Notice how they chose the term &#8220;technological differences&#8221;?, as if technological differences were determined by geographic location. If they were serious scientists they would have recognized that technology is simply an extension, a product of innate intelligence. It&rsquo;s almost as if they believe tools and inventions grew on trees in 1000BC. The authors made a conscience decision to use the term &#8220;technological differences&#8221; instead of intelligence for obvious reasons</p>

		<p> Can&rsquo;t you imagine sub-Saharan Africans reading that report and saying, &#8220;Oh, that explains why we&rsquo;re still the world&rsquo;s basket case. Guess &#8216;slavery&rsquo; and &#8216;colonialism&rsquo; and &#8216;White racism&rsquo; had nothing to do with it after all.&#8221;</p>
<p> Ha! Dream on! Does anyone think that Africans, and for that matter their distant cousins in America, will ever give up the slavery-colonialism-White racism card, when it&rsquo;s proven so profitable for them for decades now? Of course not. They&rsquo;ll continue to shuck and jive us to try to stir up our &#8220;White guilt,&#8221; and the feeling that we &#8220;owe them&#8221; something. And unfortunately, with a lot of stupid Whites, they&rsquo;ll succeed.</p>

		<p>The handbook of civilization has been written by Whites and Asians.</p>
<p>Anyone who is smart enough can simply do what has been done before. That some people can&rsquo;t grasp basic concepts like roads, irrigation, and sanitation speaks to their level of intelligence.</p>
<p>I was watching a report on an African city (I&rsquo;m sorry but I don&rsquo;t recall the name). This was CITY in which they couldn&rsquo;t get people to understand that they shouldn&rsquo;t DRINK the water from the open sewer waterways.</p>
<p>Another report showed a rural tribe that walked long distances to scoop water from a shallow natural collecting pool. No one thought to dig a deeper hole to make it easier to scoop clean water without stirring up the dirt. No one thought to clear a path and to make a community cart to carry water in larger quantities faster. No one thought to dig trench to re-direct the water to the village. No one thought to move the village closer. No one thought to use the water for irrigation.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Africa was well behind Europe even before slavery and colonialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Africa was well behind the entire world at any point in history with the exception of the stone age.  When the rest of the world was in the hunter/gatherer level, that&rsquo;s probably the only time blacks were on a par with the other races.  And of course evolution seems to have stopped for them at that point, while the rest of mankind was continuing to advance at least to some degree, with the possible exception of Australian Aborigines. </p>
<p>These excuses of colonialism and other nonsense had absolutely nothing to do with black backwardness.  They stayed behind everybody else because they were less intelligent and had fewer abilities.</p>
<p>All of the usual baseless assertions are absurd.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t this paper originally published in 2007? Maybe this was just an update.</p>
<p>Regardless, I can&rsquo;t help but laugh at the absurd comment from Lucas. Whatever one thinks of blacks, this commentary is completely unfounded and extreme.</p>
<p>&#8220;sub-saharan Africans would still be in the stone-age as they were in 1500 AD. &#8220;</p>
<p>The vast majority of SS africans used iron age technology prior to european contact. While they probably got it from elsewhere, who hasn&rsquo;t gotten iron technology from external sources? The only ones still in the stone age were pygmies and khoisan. This is so easy to confirm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Few tools,&#8221;</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>&#8220;no agriculture,&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh please- while much of it probably came from external sources, the high rates of polygamy in most of SS africa and the bantu expansion were spurred by agriculture.</p>

		<p>&#8220;no written language,&#8221;</p>
<p>Written language has only arisen in a handful of areas. Regardless, there was arabic in west african and the ge&rsquo;ez script in the east, though derived from middle eastern alphabets.</p>
<p>&#8221; cannibalism,&#8221;</p>
<p>This was mainly limited to central africa.</p>
<p>&#8221; wars, disease, slavery,&#8221;</p>
<p>Wars, disease, and slavery around 1,500 AD? Who could have engaged in such things but africans and nobody else?</p>
<p>&#8220;no domesticated animals&hellip;shall I go on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cows and other milk-rich animals were widely domesticated in SS africa prior to european contact. That&rsquo;s attested to well by the overwhelmingly frequencies of lactose tolerance in west and central africa. Regardless, the only animal that seems to have been domesticated in SS africa was the guinea fowl.</p>

		<p>I was forced to take an African history class in college a few years ago.  I remember it being so different from any other type of history class.  Previously I had classes in the history of Asia, Central Asia, Meso America, Europe, the Middle East, India and America.</p>
<p>What made the African class so different were these factors:</p>
<p>1) The teacher was a total liberal flake who seemed to have little content knowledge herself.  (She had us doing touchy feely exercises a lot!  &#8220;How do we feel about Africa?&#8221;</p>
<p>2)  Unlike all other civilizations, there was almost a complete lack of names, dates, famous events, architecture, etc.</p>
<p>3)  The only real African achievements were in West Africa when the Arabs came and brought Islam (i.e. literacy, centralized government, etc)</p>
<p>4)  My prof. spent many hours playing up the significance of &#8220;Great Zimbabwe: which was a glorified cattle pen made of stone with a couple of cone shaped towers.  Again, no names, no histories, no real knowledge other than speculation.</p>
<p>5)  We spent at least four classes dissecting how peaceful Africans were before the Europeans came because they apparently had these interconnected trade networks where everyone bribed those above and below them in the chain of command.  No one ever fought.  There were no wars.  I am not making this up.  This is what the prof. was pushing.</p>
<p>There was an actual African man in the class, and he spoke up one day about how magic and witchcraft and such were real and that the people of africa practice it and make it work for them.  The prof. was eating it up.  Curiously enough, even though this college has a lot of black students, the majority were white.</p>

In north China the earliest iron artefacts appear to be from the late fourth century B.C., but by this time the spread is quite rapid, and by the early third century B.C. iron has become the metal of choice for all implements and edged weapons. An important piece of evidence here is a mass grave of fallen soldiers of the state of Yan in Yixian County, Hebei (Liu Shishu 1975; KG 1975.4: 241-243). The date given by its excavators, the early third century B.C., appears to be very reliable. The soldiers were buried with their weapons, and we thus have a less biased sample of weapons of the time than graves normally give us (cf. Trousdale 1977). Very nearly all of the weapons are of wrought iron or steel;<br>

Africans did have agriculture, though it was not as widespread as in Europe. Most of the things you cite were already present in Africa before colonisation.</p>
<p>BlueBlood:<br>
You sound like you&rsquo;ve just been to whitehistory.com :D The &#8220;Tocharian&rsquo;s founded Chinese civilisation&#8221; theory has long been debunked. The fact that the white mummies upon which its credibility depends are found in Xinjiang, a province 3-4 thousand km away from the heartland of Chinese civilisation renders it unable to be upheld. Not to mention the difference in social organisation (how their leader was chosen) and language (polysyllabic for tocharians vs monosyllabic for chinese).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been browsing this site for a while, but I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of it. It offers some convincing arguments. And its obvious to all that it was Africa&rsquo;s technological backwardness that allowed it to be dominated. The roots of this are still unclear to me (although likely clear to all others on this site). Intelligence might come into it but I&rsquo;m not 100% certain.</p>

		<p>Rational Thinker:</p>
<p>Intelligent people learn. Either they learn through their own discoveries or the discoveries of others. It takes intelligence to recognize what works and incorporate those ideas for yourself.</p>
<p>Whites and Asians have written the handbook of civilization. Africans saw what Europeans brought. If they had even average intelligence as compared to whites, they would have adopted what Europeans showed them.</p>
<p>I was watching a report about a rural African community that had to travel long distances to get water from a naturally occurring shallow pool. No one thought to deepen the hole to make it easier to scoop water without scrapping up sediments. No thought to clear the path of rocks and build a community cart with wheels to transport water faster and in large quantities. No thought to dig a trench to divert the water or use it for irrigation.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you go in the world. Black behavior and black outcomes are universal. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a nation in Africa or neighborhood in the US, when left to their own devices, black Africans sink to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Whites have been offering black uplift programs for years. As long as whites are the majority or remain in control, some blacks appear to flourish. Left alone, they simply fail.<br>
 <br>
I believe intelligence is largely genetic. I speculate that whites went through some sort of environmental, ecological bottleneck eons ago which resulted in only the smartest surviving. This didn&rsquo;t happen in Africa. The continent never appears to have weeded out the less intelligent. Africans simple appear to reproduce in large numbers without selection for intelligence. Hence they have only ever achieved a level of intelligence that allows them subsistence living.</p>
<p>Africans don&rsquo;t seem to have created anything that advances them or civilization and they don&rsquo;t appear to have the capacity to learn from others. </p>

		<p>Dear Rational Thinker: &#8220;Intelligence might come into it but I&rsquo;m not 100% certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is now overwhelming, irrefutable evidence that average African IQ is about two Standard Deviation below that of Ashkenazim Jews, and about one Standard Deviation below that of Europeans.  Furthermore, IQ correlates with everything else, from national wealth, historical scientific and agricultural accomplishments, level of society &amp; culture, crime rates, etc.  There is no place on Earth where Africans settle that is not a disaster.  It is true that when Africans are embedded in European societies, and given special care (Head-Start, welfare, free college, special tutoring, affirmative-action programs, etc.) that individual Africans can perform at a moderate level.  This is especially if African children are removed from their biological parents and raised by White parents in White communities.  However, when left to their own &#8220;creativity&#8221; they quickly dismantle civilization and revert back to their natural state.  There is also the problem of regression to the mean:  the children of high-IQ, high-performing Africans have lower IQ&rsquo;s than their parents.  Hence, any &#8220;gains&#8221; are temporary.   </p>

		<p>I think the defining difference between black and white is the reasoning ability. Deductive reasoning ability enables one to choose the most likely relationship, e.g cause and effect, from ALL available observaions and evidence. Blacks only have one explanation, viz. racism, in spite of the glaring contradictions obvious to more intelligent observers.<br>

<p>Africans had agriculture, written language and iron? They had to discover it. Now we gave them this discovery for free. They don&rsquo;t even need to think anymore but just use it.</p>
<p>But they can&rsquo;t! <br>
Even after reading is so important for our society and after we showed them how to do it, they have so many problems especially in Africa to learn reading and writing. So how do you think they could ever discover and develop it on their own when there was no need of it 2000 years ago?<br>
Why could they done it then but can&rsquo;t do it now? </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not pretty rational thinking! </p>

		<p>John Engelman, iron smelting began in the Middle East or South East Europe first and then radiated outward.  Caucasians brought iron smelting to China.  More information has gone into East Asia just like Africa than has come out.  BTW, scientists a couple years ago found at least one worker buried in Qin Shi Huang&rsquo;s tomb (Terracota Army) is Caucasian.  Another ancient Caucasian man named Yu Hong from 1,400 years ago was found in Eastern China.</p>
<p>Rational Thinker, the vast majority of ancient Chinese capitals were located in what is now modern day central China which happened to be the Eastern most location of the Silk Roads.  It wasn&rsquo;t until the collapse of trading on the Silk Roads and the emergence of sea trade by Middle Easterners to China when most Chinese capitals were located on the East Coast.  I&rsquo;m sure East Asians developed their own way of organizing their societies since it seems to be largely genetic.</p>

<p>Wrong.  The anti-colonialist movements that liberated many peoples from foreign conquerers in the 20th Century were often communist.</p>

I merely dispute the fact that Whites brought civilisation to China (civilisation meaning a large agricultural society that has sufficient resources to create a complex society). The theory that the iron age radiated from the middle east has quite a bit of evidence and I look forward to more evidence being uncovered (especially in Sri Lanka where there are promising excavations).</p>
<p>On a side note, the works of Confucius refer to the Chinese as the &#8220;black haired race&#8221;. It only stands to reason that there would have been people with lighter coloured hair in modern China as well to allow for using black hair as a symbol of identity. Though they weren&rsquo;t held in high esteem as sources show.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I was forced to take an African history class in college a few years ago. I remember it being so different from any other type of history class. Previously I had classes in the history of Asia, Central Asia, Meso America, Europe, the Middle East, India and America&#8221;.</p>
<p>Actually, when I was in college, the textbooks we had on Latin and South America held the most bias. They were a blatant liberal and marxist orgy-fest. Guevara himself could not have done a better job for the cause writing the books. It seems the farther back in history the era one studies, or the farther away a region is geographically, the more it becomes distorted. Finally becoming a complete falsehood. AmRen magazine had an interesting story in a recent issue about an American scientist of only 50 years ago who&rsquo;s sciences has been completely rewritten to serve a multicultural agenda. Not that present day events can&rsquo;t be distorted, it&rsquo;s just more blatant usually when the subject is far back in history or from a geographically isolated part of the world.  </p>

<p>White people ought to mind their own business. It is whites who have messed up black people, by trying to force civilization on to a people who are not capable of it. About 100 years ago, all whites were race realists, who knew that blacks were radically different from whites. But even in those days, whites were still trying to shove civilization down the throats of black people, by trying to turn blacks into white people. Don&rsquo;t you consider this to be cruel?</p>
<p>Whites should never have gone into Africa in the first place. They should have built a wall around the continent, to keep non-black people out of the continent. Blacks are happy living in the backward tribal environments that they create for themselves. Arabs and whites have made blacks miserable, by trying to force them to accept religions and cultures that are alien to them.   <br>

		<p>The  article  in itself is  just  silly.  Africa  is  a  huge  place  with  cultures  and  peoples spread  over  its  4  corners.  The  authors of the  article  don&rsquo;t seem  to  know  that  by  1500 AD Africa  had  long entered  the  Iron Age  &mdash;  with  its  iron smelting  technologies mainly  of  indigenous  origins.  There  were  also towns  and  cities  mainly  in  Africa  north  of the  equator.  Africa  had  also long  practiced  agriculture  and  long  had  domesticated  animals  &mdash;  such  as  cows, sheep, goats, camels, horses,  etc.</p>
<p>The article, as  I said, is  just  silly  and  even  more  silly for  the  editors  of Macroeconomics  to  have  published  it.  </p>

<p>Did those technological advances take place anywhere outside the North and East of Africa? That is the places that now speak Semitic languages, show Semitic admixture and form the area that is rightly called Africa? Ancient Europeans used to refer to everything below that area as &#8216;Sima&rsquo;</p>

		<p>When Romans went North Africa, they draw a lot of pictures of the people there (their enemies). Most of them have very clear blond hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>It is like saying in 50 years that all achievements of South Africa was actually made by black Africans. Or blacks enabled whites to go to the moon.</p>
