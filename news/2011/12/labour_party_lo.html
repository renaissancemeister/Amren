<h1><a href="http://www.thelocal.no/page/view/labour-party-looks-to-slash-oslo-immigrant-dominance">Labour Party Looks to Slash Oslo Immigrant Dominance</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local, December 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Leading Labour Party politicians in Oslo believe voters have too much influence in the city and are calling for changes to the country&rsquo;s election laws after immigrant candidates snagged eleven of the party&rsquo;s 20 seats on the City Council.</p>
<p>Among those backing legislative change is Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, who sits on the board of a local Labour committee that wants parties to be able to present voters with a list of 15 hand-picked candidates.</p>
<p>In accordance with current rules, the party populated its list with ten names in this autumn&rsquo;s city elections</p>
<p>This left voters with plenty of scope to select their own preferred candidates, enabling seven politicians with immigrant backgrounds to sail into winning positions after managing to secure enough personal votes for a seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve now got three representatives from Somalia and Somaliland. That&rsquo;s in excess of what one might expect,&#8221; party veteran Rune Gerhardsen told newspaper VG.</p>
<p>Gerhardsen stressed that his desire for a rule change did not stem from any sense of dissatisfaction with the current councillors, but he did argue there was a need for greater balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comparatively small pressure groups can make relatively large gains when they apply enough resources. Ethnic groups have shown themselves to be good at mobilizing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Abid Raja from the Liberal Party (Venstre) said he found the comments alarming.</p>
<p>&#8220;What he says about his own party colleagues with Somali backgrounds is way beneath his dignity,&#8221; Raja told news agency NTB.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of increasing the number of set candidates we should be going in the opposite direction and getting rid of it altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raja pointed out that ethnic Norwegian candidates had also harvested their fair share of personal votes, with Rune Gerhardsen himself the main beneficiary. Of the Labour Party&rsquo;s candidates, Gerhardsen and Libe Rieber-Mohn attracted the highest number of personal votes, followed by Abdullah Alsabeehg.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old Alsabeehg, whose family came to Norway as political refugees from Bahrain when he was very young, denied his election success had stemmed from a recruitment campaign targeting voters of the same ethnic background as himself.</p>
<p>Instead, he attributed his large personal vote haul to the backing he received from the Labour Party&rsquo;s youth wing (AUF).</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the AUF&rsquo;s youth candidate in the election and was supported by young people of various ethnic backgrounds from around the city,&#8221; he told NTB.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s wrong to make a distinction between minority politicians and other politicians. Nobody uses the term minority footballer to describe Moa or Carew,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Among representatives of Norway&rsquo;s other main parties, there was no support for the idea of lengthening pre-populated electoral lists.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see that the Labour Party&rsquo;s City Council group in Oslo is skewed, both from an ethnic and geographical perspective, but that just shows that party democracy is more or less dead within the Labour Party beyond the group of active immigrants,&#8221; said Conservative Party (Høyre) MP Per-Kristian Foss to politisk.no.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a problem for Oslo&rsquo;s Labour Party; I don&rsquo;t think parliament should change the election law,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Anders Anundsen from the Progress Party said Labour would be better advised to move in the exact opposite direction, a view supported by the Centre Party&rsquo;s Per Olaf Lundteigen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust in politicians and political parties is dropping. That means voters should be given more of a say as to who gets elected in parliamentary, county, and municipal elections,&#8221; he told politisk.no.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ethnic groups have shown themselves to be good at mobilizing&#8221;</p>
<p>This is happening in many places, notably in Canada. In accordance with multicultural policy, most ethnic groups maintain a political center of gravity around their local &#8216;community leaders&rsquo; and &#8216;ethnic community centers&rsquo; or temples.</p>
<p>Anyone seeking elected office must present themselves for community approval. Once chosen, the supporters are mobilized to take party memberships.  The anointed one wins the party candidacy because the caucus was stacked with his people.</p>
<p>In the Toronto area, an unusual event occurred. Two Muslim candidates cancelled each other out, and the white candidate won.  One of the two Muslims complained that he was attacked afterwards by his own community, because he split the Muslim vote and allowed the white candidate to take the seat.</p>

		<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s questionable why a &#8220;political refugee&#8221; from Bahrain is in Norway. If you are a genuine refugee, you will go to the next safe country and not to some country in the farthest north.</p>

		<p>#1 makes an excellent point that applies in many places. I laugh when I try to imagine the look on the faces of the long-time lefty council members when they saw the election results come in. &#8220;I fought so hard to get these people in the country and this is what they do&hellip;.?&#8221;</p>
<p>Norwegians, like Swedes, are comically naive about the ways of the world. They think Somalis and other global trash will wash up on their shores and become just like them and adopt their ways. Only slowly and reluctantly are they recognizing how wrong they are. Somalis stay Somalis in every way except now they have a nice fat check from the good Norwegian people. And when Muhammad al Muhammad comes around to tell them that he&rsquo;s running for city council and will make sure life continues to get better for all the Muhammads, well, he can count on their support. </p>
<p>Imagine the pathetic spectacle of white native Norwegians making appeals for political support from immigrant populations. </p>

<p>This statement is more proof that whites do not understand what is going on or who is doing it. Vidkun Quisling was not a traitor to his country, he was loyal to his race &amp; his country. Those that fought against him were and still are the traitors. </p>

<p>I understand your point but disagree vehemently on some specifics in your criticism of my post.</p>
<p>Vidkun Quisling enabled a foreign invader, the Nazis of Germany, to invade his country of Norway. I see your point. You see the Nazis as some sort of defenders of whites. But the Norwegians had made their own decision not to support the Nazis and they were right. Quisling imposed a foreign military dictatorship upon his own people. A foregn army was brought in to mistreat and lord it over the Norwegian people and to impose a dictatorship over the Norwegians. That is unforgivable.</p>
<p>Ironically, and as an aside, the Germans were really jsut Nordic wannabees. Take a look at the high staff of Germany, a bunch of alpine type, fat, dark haired Nordic wannabees!  English people are more Nordic than the Germans. Only the Germans from the areas in Germany (Angeln, Schlesvig-Holstein, Saxony) from which the Anglo-Saxons invaded England are very Nordic. That is the humerous irony of the Nazis.</p>

		<p>P.S. I do know who is doing it and I do not appreciate it. But plenty of Nordic liberal idiots support multiculturalism and Quisling immgration attacks. That does not mean that the antidote is the Nazis.</p>

		<p>OSLO</p>
<p>Demographic disaster in the making as is typical in major European cities</p>
<p>City population Oct. 2011 <br>
611,491</p>
<p>Includes (not all groups) as of 1/1/11 (Statistics Norway)<br>
Pakistanis 21,629 (group rank 1)<br>
Somalis 12,248 (group rank 2)<br>
Swedes 12,088 and Poles 10,430 (group ranks 3 and 4)<br>
Sri Lankans 7,238<br>
Iraqis 7,100<br>
Turks 6,130<br>
Moroccans 5,993<br>
Afghans 2,741</p>
<p>from wikipedia</p>
<p>An estimated 28 % of Oslo&rsquo;s residents are of an immigrant or non-Norwegian background (about 170,000 inhabitants),<br>
predicted to increase to between 44% and 51% around 2030. </p>
<p>In 2008, the immigrant population accounted for about 82% of the population growth of the city. </p>
<p>From 1970 to 2007, the ethnic Norwegian population decreased by 10.1% while the immigrant population increased by 823.6%.</p>
<p>Pakistanis make up 20,812 of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants, followed by Somalis (10,780), Swedes (9,250), and Poles (8,854)  &mdash;  these being the four largest ethnic minority groups. </p>
<p>Other large immigrant groups are people from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Turkey, Morocco, Iraq and Denmark.</p>
<p>By June 2009, more than 40% of Oslo schools had a majority of people of immigrant backgrounds, with some schools having up to a 97% immigrant share.</p>
<p>Schools are also increasingly divided by ethnicity, with white flight being widespread. In the borough Groruddalen in 2008 for instance, the ethnic Norwegian population decreased by 1,500, while the immigrant population increased by 1,600. From 2000–2007, 7,250 ethnic Norwegians moved out of the city, while 32,700 persons of immigrant background, mostly non-western, moved out.</p>
<p>The population of Oslo is currently increasing at a record rate of nearly 2% annually (17% over the last 15 years), making it the fastest-growing Scandinavian capital.</p>
<p>The increase is due, in almost equal degree, to high birth-rates and immigration, though both is largely due to immigration, seeing that the ethnic Norwegian population is actually decreasing. In particular, immigration from Poland and the Baltic states has increased sharply since the accession of these countries to the EU in 2004.</p>
<p>Oslo is a city with various religious communities. The city has a low percentage of Christians in contrast to other parts of the country. </p>
<p>As of 2009, 11% of the population of Oslo are Muslim, but just 3.59% are registered Muslims.</p>

<p>I know exactly what&rsquo;s going on and I&rsquo;ve know it for a long time. Vidkun Qusling enabled the Nazi invasion of Norway. The Nazis, a foreign, non-Norwegian nation, took over Norway, forced Norwegians to obey Nazi laws and mistreated and even killed Norwegians in their own country. He was anything but a champion of his people. There were Norwegians who opposed him and the Nazis enough to risk their lives in the Norwegian resistance. </p>
