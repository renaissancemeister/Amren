			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jake Crates, All Hip Hop, December 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Over $7.2 million in drugs and 161 weapons were confiscated after a year long investigation by the Washington D.C. Police and the Bureau the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which operated as fictional rap label.</p>
<p>According to Washington D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier, D.C. police and ATF agents acted as undercover officers and &#8220;music industry insiders&#8221; during the year-long sting.</p>
<p>The police created the &#8220;Manic Enterprisess&#8221; studio in Northeast Washington, for fictional rap artist Richie Valdez in November of 2010.</p>
<p>Agents then told the underground world and black market that they were seeking to purchase weapons and drugs.</p>
<p>Over the course of the year, agents confiscated 161 firearms (including a rocket launcher), 29 assault weapons, 80 pounds of methamphetamine, 21 pounds of cocaine, 1.25 gallons of PCP, 24 pounds of marijuana, heroin and Ecstasy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This was an extremely dangerous operation. These suspects had bragged about other violent crimes they had committed and had no qualms about killing police officers, guards and other innocent people,&#8221; Chief Lanier continued. &#8220;All the law enforcement members involved in this operation are to be commended for their bravery.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the seizures of drugs and weapons, police said many of the 70 suspects detained bragged about other crimes and reportedly stated they would kill police officers or other innocent people if necessary.</p>

		<p>Police confiscated &#8220;80 pounds of methamphetamine, 21 pounds of cocaine, 1.25 gallons of PCP, 24 pounds of marijuana&#8221; and a partridge in a pear tree.  One hifi buddy of mine, a lawyer, advocates giving these addicts whatever drug they want in copious amounts for free.  After a few months and thousands of body bags, he says, the problem will be solved. </p>

		<p>Geeze louise, Mabel.  The cops went to the hip hop industry and found a bunch of drugs and guns.  What were the odds, right?  In related news, cops raid a haystack and find hay.</p>
<p><i>Over the course of the year, agents confiscated 161 firearms (including a rocket launcher), 29 assault weapons, 80 pounds of methamphetamine, 21 pounds of cocaine, 1.25 gallons of PCP, 24 pounds of marijuana, heroin and Ecstasy.</i></p>
<p>Rocket launcher and meth are really interesting items to find in the ghetto.</p>
<p>When St. Louis had black talk radio, that&rsquo;s all their drone regular callers could talk about, was all the meth that white people do.  This being St. Louis talk radio, the phrase they often used was &#8220;white hoosiers,&#8221; and trust me, you Indiana residents, that wasn&rsquo;t a term of endearment.  And, as far as I have been able to discern from afar, meth is not really a drug that blacks either do or deal.  So how did 80 pounds of meth wind up in black D.C. drug dealers?  Maybe the blacks are distributing, while whites or Chicano Hispanics in D.C. are the users.</p>
<p>And a rocket launcher?  I never knew that a rocket launcher was a necessary accessory of the ghetto thug life.  What are we doing, hawking black market rocket launchers to Al Qaeda sleeper cell types laying low stateside?  Where&rsquo;s their precious PATRIOT Act now when you need it?  Where&rsquo;s the call to send these black hoodlums to Gitmo indefinitely without a trial (NDAA) because they were giving material support to terrorist boogie woogies?</p>

		<p>Question Diversity,</p>
<p>Yes it&rsquo;s possible that blacks are involved in distribution of meth, but it&rsquo;s also possible (or likely) that the FBI is adding some information to be PC and keeping details to themselves. Sort of like when police &#8220;gang units&#8221; crack down on skinheads and K members.  Skinheads pose no real threat to anyone, but the FBI must continue to be PC about crime statistics.</p>

		<p>4 Paul:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not grokking.  Your theory is that they didn&rsquo;t find any meth, but are putting &#8220;80 pounds of meth&#8221; in the press release so the media copy about the story doesn&rsquo;t come off racially stereotypical?  I doubt the Feds would do that, because it would mean that blacks are into meth, and that would destroy the &#8220;only white hoosiers do meth&#8221; narrative that professional black excuseologists love so much.</p>
<p>Maybe your theory is that they put meth in there wanting people to think that it wasn&rsquo;t just blacks that were lassoed in as a result of this sting operation.  Maybe they want people thinking some doped up Eminem types were a big part of the D.C. hip hop scene.</p>
<p>The original article does say further down that:</p>
<p><i>The depth of the investigation went one step further, when officers ventured to Atlanta with suspects claiming to be associated with the Mexican Drug Cartel &ldquo;La Familia&rdquo;.  The Mexican cartel members unknowingly introduced agents to the source that was supplying guns from Georgia.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably where the meth came from, provided they actually did find meth.</p>

		<p>Blacks do indeed do meth. Remember that heroin was extremely popular with them back in the 70s. Which was upstaged by crack in the 80s. </p>
<p>It may be argued that most of the meth heads arrested for possession and manufacturing are indeed White. It takes some intelligence after all to be able to make it without blowing yourself up.  </p>
<p>I may also be the case that the meth was acquired in all one load. It is very common for most drug dealing black to smoke PCP/crack and weed as they push other drugs they consider &#8220;evil&#8221;.</p>
<p>But this is just real life observations.</p>

<p>Yes, at one time, Indiana had its share of Meth addicts. Indianapolis was overrun with crack about 10-15 years ago, but the Meth problem tended to be concentrated around Terre Haute. If I were forced to live in Terre Haute, I might do meth to relieve the pain. It was so bad there for a while that places like Cincinnati, Cleveland, etc. would send their drug task forces to Terre Haute to learn the latest tricks of the trade. </p>
<p>Around 1998 or 99, there was a case in Indianapolis where a white guy with two kids was a crackhead and tried to rip off a dealer (who was black). The street name for the crackhead was &#8220;White Mike&#8221;. The dealer opened fire and killed White Mike&rsquo;s 6 year old son. I&rsquo;m guessing both dealer and addict are still incarcerated. </p>

<p>We are all waiting for the backlash focusing on the the hateful stereotyping that blacks can&rsquo;t spell enterprises, and that the rap artist has an Hispanic surname.  Someone will point out how shameful this is, and unfair to the majority of minorities that don&rsquo;t deal drugs and weapons.</p>

<p>I came to the same conclusion years ago, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t like thinking outside of the box.  To them the idea that the DEA could be making the problem worse, well it creates blue screen errors in people&rsquo;s minds.  Similar to how Ron Paul perplexes insider Republicans and their supporters.  </p>
<p>Americans have always glamorized the criminal, remember gangsters at one point in time didn&rsquo;t make people think droopy pants and gold teeth.  Due to the criminalization of the drugs, the government inadvertently romanticizes the inner city hood.  With today&rsquo;s instant and omnipresent media the message is delivered with almost perfect efficiency where it is picked up by those least likely to resist the message, namely our youth.  They then go to the local government run degeneracy generator, I mean school, and the next thing you know everyone from Philadelphia, PA to Podunk, SD is doing the same drugs, wearing the same clothes, using the same slang, and aspiring to be the same criminal gangsters.  </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the black gangster that brought himself into your life from his lowly existence in some hood.  No, it was the system, a system you support with your tax dollars, and if you support the status quo with votes or charitable donations to political parties, you are supporting, albeit unwittingly, that which you hate.<br>

		<p>9 Ex-Indy:</p>
<p>There was a little bit of actual white meth violence in St. Louis in the last decade, the worst being when a lovely pair of meth heads trying to steal cold pills out of a supermarket were being chased by a store security guard, the meth heads ran him over with their car and killed him.  Now that the state and Feds have cut the flow of cold pills, the trailer park operations are dead.  So the meth heads are turning to Mexican gangs for their fixes, ergo meth violence has migrated from white to Hispanic.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make had nothing to do with Indiana having a meth problem, it&rsquo;s the semantics of the word &#8220;hoosier.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s a compliment in Indiana, a slur in St. Louis.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve reached the conclusion that we might be better off legalising drugs and letting nature take its course. It would be cheaper treating addicts than chasing dealers. We could tax it to pay for treatment and the drug dealers would be out of business.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to start a World Star Hip Hop-type page, where idiots posted their racist attack videos, then the police used them to track down the criminals? </p>
<p>Every video uploaded would have an associated I.P. address or mobile device I.D. associated with it. Track it back to the general area the video was uploaded from, or to the individual mobile device. In the case of a stolen smart phone, at least you&rsquo;d get them for possession of stolen property. Then, pull on the thread and see what unravels.</p>
<p>Allstarhiphopworld.com and rappersplanet.com were available as of the time I typed this post. To be continued&hellip;</p>

<p>What makes you think that World Star Hip Hop isn&rsquo;t already that?  Think about the Sherlock Holmes story &#8220;Hound of the Baskervilles.&#8221;  Why aren&rsquo;t there any serious calls to take down WSHH?  Answer:  It might have been a sting effort from the beginning.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m quite confident that the &#8216;rocket launcher&rsquo; is a spent LAW tube.  The tubes are useless but make great press copy.  Aside, the whole grenade thing that gets a lot of comical coverage too because they never mention the &#8216;grenades&rsquo; are inert empty surplus items that are always (okay, almost) missing the key ingredients.</p>

<p>Of course, you may be right. While checking your comment, I found this: </p>
<p>ARIN Details | Network Solutions</p>
<p>I found this block of text most interesting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Abuse@noc4hosts.com might be interested to know what one of their clients is doing, if this <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> a sting site. After all, if WSHH advocates killing White folks and it actually happens, a civil suit could be brought against noc4hosts.com for advocating criminal behavior. That sort of thing probably violates their terms of service, also.</p>

		<p>I personally find any laws prohibiting ownership/use of guns and drugs offensive in a free society.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of blacks/Hispanics, however, do not show the maturity necessary with such items.</p>
<p>The only positive aspect of the drug war/gun control are that they lock up a lot of violent blacks.</p>

		<p>A broader issue in all this is ATF itself.  A few years ago the<br>
internal inspection function (has there ever really been one, <br>
as distinct from an &#8220;image maintenance&#8221; function? ) was transferred to DoJ. However, ATF has long been regarded by<br>
seasoned FBI agents, for example, as being  a rogue agency that is most often answerable to no one.  This is conducive to<br>
AFT having an undly large number of agents and supervisors who are cop proficient but intellectually short-sighted.  Any self<br>
appointed &#8220;non-governmental&#8221; entity o$ten$ibly $truggling against hate, bigotry, etc. can easily spoon feed such people.  </p>
