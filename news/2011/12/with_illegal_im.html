			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Rubin and Paloma Esquivel, Los Angeles Times, December 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Unlicensed drivers without prior convictions would be given the chance to avoid having their vehicles impounded under new rules outlined Tuesday by the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>
<p>The proposed changes to the impound procedures are a potentially explosive issue because LAPD Chief Charlie Beck designed the reforms to remedy what he believes is the unfair burden that impounds place on illegal immigrants. Since immigrants who are in the country illegally cannot get driver&rsquo;s licenses in California and most other states, they make up the majority of the drivers who have their cars impounded for the infraction.</p>
<p>Beck contends that the hundreds of dollars in fees and fines that must be paid to retrieve an impounded car and the disruption to illegal immigrants&rsquo; often tenuous hold on jobs deal a disproportionate blow to people &#8220;who are a valuable asset to our community and who have very limited resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview Tuesday, Beck amplified his position: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a fairness issue. There is a vast difference between someone driving without a license because they cannot legally be issued one and someone driving after having their license revoked.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s influential police union, which is leading the opposition to the plan, has criticized Beck and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for trying what they see as an effort to score political points through reforms that the union warns could hurt public safety.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the new rules, police would let an unlicensed driver who has not been convicted previously of driving without a valid license summon someone with a license, who would then be allowed to drive the car away.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beck assured the board that he would not put the changes into place until hearing concerns from commissioners, immigration advocates, opponents of the plan, and the public. He gave no firm timeline.</p>

<p>Beck just admitted that a Federal crime is taking place.  Either someone knowingly hired these illegal aliens, or they used fake SS numbers and identities to get the jobs in case the employer did check.</p>

		<p>There is a vast difference between someone driving without a license because they cannot legally be issued one and someone driving after having their license revoked.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
This is one of the primary lies that needs to be confronted.  There is almost NO difference among this population between someone who disrespects our laws by coming here illegally and someone who is caught and had their license revoked.  Both groups drink and drive with impunity, kill people constantly, cause billions of dollars in liability they do not bother to cover with insurance.</p>
<p>Not mentioned is the large number of legal immigrants driving without a license.  Why bother.  They will just be pulled over in a few weeks drinking and drugging and driving and have it revoked.  These people aren&rsquo;t concerned with establishing identity as they are in hiding it, as they commit one crime after another.</p>
<p>There is NO difference between a legal, an illegal, licensed or unlicensed, identified criminal vs those who haven&rsquo;t been caught yet.</p>
<p>This is the primary issue with regard to immigration.  Prior waves of immigrants came here to leach off our society.  Most left, some stayed and integrated.  It has not been a very positive thing for America.  But the current immigrants who come here are almost all criminals.  They come here to rape, rob, murder and steal.  They fill our prisons to overthrowing and bring literal warfare to many cities as they commit gross ethnic cleansing of blacks.  All the money they steal from us via welfare, slavery and the drug trade goes back home to enable mass beheadings, overthrow of entire sections of Mexico, demon worship and worse.  Mexico has become a place where psychopaths kidnap hundreds, tear out their hearts and cook them up on a hibachi in a good old fashioned cannibalistic satanic ritual.  People ripped open and their intestines used to write threatening messages.  Buses hijacked and the people on board forced to fight to the last survivor who gets to live as a slave.</p>
<p>This is what &#8220;immigration&#8221; is responsible for.  It&rsquo;s more than enough reason to wage war on mexico and execute every last enabler of the drug/slave/welfare state in the US.</p>

		<p>Fairness issue Beck?  </p>
<p>How about a <i>safety</i> issue?  More innocent Americans will be vulnerable, endangered and killed by YOUR pandering to unlicensed, illegal alien drivers. But what does that matter to LAs Mexican mayor or to YOU, the appointed lapdog?</p>
<p>The LAPPL, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, opposes this plan warning that <i>lenient rules allow dangerous drivers to remain on the road.</i></p>
<p>But what do FACTS matter to you, Beck?  Your job is to make life as comfortable as possible for LAs massive illegal alien population.</p>
<p><i>A pair of studies in the 1990s that found unlicensed drivers were nearly five times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than licensed ones. Impounding vehicles, the study concluded, was an effective way to keep unlicensed drivers off the road.</i></p>
<p><i>Two nationwide studies by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety concluded that 13% to 14% of drivers involved in fatal crashes did not have a valid license at the time.</i></p>
<p>Why should YOU care about the carnage and damage caused by unlicensed, uninsured drivers on California&rsquo;s highways?</p>
<p>Santa Ana California, 11/2011:</p>
<p><i>An unlicensed, uninsured Southern California teenager has been charged with vehicular manslaughter for the death of a passenger killed when his pickup truck hit a tree.  18-year-old Francisco Jesus Ochoa of Lake Elsinore was swerving on Ortega Highway before the Friday morning crash that killed his friend Margarita Gutierrez.</i></p>
<p>Bell, California, 11/2011:</p>
<p><i>An unlicensed, drunken driver is in jail after crashing a van into a Southern California furniture store&hellip;The driver, whose name is being withheld, tried to run away.</i></p>
<p>What is the purpose of having police force if the CHIEF of Police aids and abets lawbreakers?</p>

		<p>    What if a an American citizen fails to renew their registration? Will they get the same treatment that an illegal will? I think not. So if you encounter a police checkpoint and two cars are pulled over, one driven by a citizen and the other by an illegal; the Mexican ( likely) will be set free, while the citizen(white)will have his car impounded and possibly jailed&hellip;. Unfreakin&rsquo; believable.</p>

		<p>Here in Washington state illegal aliens are allowed to obtain legal drivers licenses. But they rarely bother, and as a poster above noted, neither do half or more of the legal immigrants. When one of these insane drivers hits you, you sit in your car and watch as the driver (usually a man) gets out of his car, followed by his mother, his wife (girlfriend, baby momma, whatever) [i]her[/i] sister, their mother, and anywhere from seven to fifteen kids of varying sizes. He takes off running and the rest of them all stand around waving their arms and wailing and chittering in Spanglish till the cops get there. Then the cops have to call an interpreter, then 5 or 6 ambulances to treat them on the spot or take them to the hospital. Eventually the cops will get around to you, if you haven&rsquo;t died by then. Naturally there is never any insurance on the car that hit you so you have to pay all your own bills, and your insurance costs go up when you eventually recover and get a new car. If the driver is caught by some miracle, it will be discovered that he has nine previous DUIs. He will either be bailed out or let go on a promise to appear in court, and no one will see him again till the next time he almost kills somebody, again driving drunk, still without license and insurance, and on and on and on. <br>
But by all means we must not do anything that will inconvenience these &#8220;valuable asset(s) to our community&#8221;. </p>
<p>What about our inconveniences/injuries/deaths?</p>

		<p>They have already committed a crime by being here illegally in the first place and 10% of illegals come here with felony records and are running from the law in their own countries.  We have become the hide out nation for the worlds criminals.  We welcome the rapists and murders with open arms as valuable assets willing to work for $5/hr for the rest of their lives and meanwhile they are laughing at us for being so stupid.</p>

		<p>Shift to robotics.  Take the &#8216;value&rsquo; (10-20 billion transfered to Mexico while we pay for social welfare, every year, just about balances out the consumer gains) of the cheap labor out of the picture and make it FREE labor through anthropomorphic robotics.</p>
<p>Force the owners of said robots to pay 1/3rd of their unit&rsquo;s annual wage equivalencies (as profits) to a common program to support illegal immigrant social welfare and watch how fast the wealthy decide that maybe it&rsquo;s for the best that we stop being a catch basin for the Third World&rsquo;s unwanteds.</p>
<p>Attack the root cause, don&rsquo;t poison the leaves.</p>
<p>To support this program, I would make getting licenses simple and the penalties for not having a license severe.  Mail in a request for it and you shall have one, complete with unified insurance, supplied by the federal government.</p>
<p>All for the purposes of making sure that if immigrant X is driving with a &#8216;free&rsquo; license they are untraceable by residency.</p>
<p>If they are (illegally) using a residency where they do not in fact habitate, shutting down that mailing address altogether and possibly arresting the owner of said home for &#8216;aiding and abetting&rsquo; (hit and run, vehicular homocide, whatever) the criminal would in turn make it possible to put ALL drivers registered to that address on an arrest list.</p>
<p>Look folks, the time has long since come to write off Mexifornia if not the West Coast and move on to saving whiter fields.  But we can teach ourselves valuable lessons on controlling the outbreak and reversing it when the time comes that whites must inevitably take their own destinies in hand and act to secure another, separate, homeland within an inland set of borders.</p>
<p>Wake up.  It&rsquo;s come to that point.</p>

<p>Total costs to medicare and the supplemental insurance so far, about $700,000.  Projected life span is about 25 more years. I need more surgery, MRIs every few months and monthly visits to 3 Drs and lots of meds.</p>

		<p>It might be that LARAZA, MALDEF, ACLU, ADL, AJC, Holder&rsquo;s DOJ and Mulatto Kamala Harris&rsquo; California DOJ threatened a lawsuit if the policy did not change.</p>
<p>Knowing the city would lose, the city just capitulated.  One funny thing about the traffic and parking fines in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>They are extremely high, for instance almost $400.00 for running a red light.  It is the main job of the police.</p>
<p>But the city gets very little money from the fines because most of the people who are ticketed are Hispanics who just ignore the fines and would be hard put to pay them out of their welfare and minimum wage checks.</p>

Yet, just because illegals are NOT suppose to be here in the first place and are NOT suppose to be driving our roads, you say it is &#8220;unfair&#8221; to impound their cars that they are not suppose to have or drive in the first place? What about the INSURANCE they cannot get also? WHO pays for all the accidents they have caused which maim and KILL Americans? These ILLEGALS get off scot free on every law and rule we HAVE to abide by? </p>

<p>People such as him sure will not claim exemption to the law for ANY poor White citizen, now would he? Because WE are NOT valuable ASSETS to our community and have limited resources?</p>
<p>I detest that traitor!</p>
<p> My son cannot get his drivers license because of arrears in his child support payments! They took his license. What has not paying child support (being poor and out of work, and his 2 kids are now 21 and 23 years old) have to do with one&rsquo;s ability to drive?   He has no way to go to work (as his old job requires a valid license) so I guess it was okay to impound his car and he had to pay huge fees to get it back and is afraid to even drive because of our insane drivers license laws FOR American CITIZENS.</p>

<p>Los Angeles Daily News<br>
Mayor Villaraigosa&rsquo;s policy to end seizure of vehicles of unlicensed drivers panned<br>
By Dana Bartholomew, Staff Writer <br>
12/19/2011 </p>
<p>Last weekend, an unlicensed driver ran down a 60-year-old woman trying to cross the street in Panorama City, killing her. </p>
<p>The death renewed calls Monday to reverse a pending city policy to go easy on unlicensed drivers - many of them illegal immigrants - by not immediately impounding their cars. </p>
<p>&#8220;The tragic accident in Panorama City shows how the mayor&rsquo;s new policy can result in innocent people being injured or killed,&#8221; said Paul M. Weber, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, in a statement. </p>
<p>&#8220;The mayor&rsquo;s directive puts politics above public safety and should be rescinded.&#8221; </p>
<p>Responding to pressure from immigrant-rights groups, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck have created a new policy to lift a 30-day impound for cars of unlicensed drivers. </p>
<p>The policy, expected to be enacted in January, would only impound the cars of drivers whose licenses were revoked or suspended, or who have a prior conviction for driving without a license. </p>
<p>The remainder - including the cars of illegal immigrants - would not be towed. Instead, they could be picked up by the registered owner or another licensed driver. </p>
<p>This could save the drivers thousands of dollars in impound and towing fees, which many poor families can&rsquo;t afford, defenders say. </p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of drivers can&rsquo;t get their licenses because they&rsquo;re undocumented, not because they don&rsquo;t know how to drive,&#8221; said Gilbert </p>
<p>Peter Sanders, a Villaraigosa spokesman, did not return numerous calls for comment. </p>
<p>Protecting public safety </p>
<p>It was before dawn Saturday when Patricia Ellen Riedy of Wildwood, Mo., was killed by an unlicensed driver in Panorama City, police said. </p>
<p>Martha Cruz, 36, of Panorama City, was driving a black Ford Explorer and struck the woman outside a crosswalk on Woodman Avenue, police said. </p>
<p>Cruz was not arrested, but she was given a citation to appear in court. Her car was impounded during the investigation, police said. The Los Angeles police union said the accident underscores the danger of allowing unlicensed drivers to escape car impounds. </p>
<p>Of the 40,000 fatal car crashes across the nation each year, one in five involve an unlicensed driver, according to an American Automobile Association Study cited by the union. </p>
<p>In addition, unlicensed drivers are nearly five times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than licensed ones, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. </p>
<p>Weber with the police officers&rsquo; union said that is precisely why the state enacted the 30-day impound law for unlicensed motorists. Opponents, however, maintain it was to punish drunk drivers. </p>
<p>Weber said the mayor ignored that law - giving free reign to unlicensed drivers and illegal immigrants, rather than enforce impounds designed to protect public safety. </p>
<p>&#8220;An unlicensed driver willing to ignore the law is, at least temporarily, less likely to further violate this law because he or she will not have access to the impounded vehicle,&#8221; Weber said. &#8220;The cost and inconvenience of recovering an impounded vehicle discourages people without licenses from driving.&#8221; </p>
