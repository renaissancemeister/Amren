			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mashaun D. Simon, The Grio, December 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Was Jesus black?</p>
<p>It is the age old question that has generated years and years of debate. But according to most scholars, the answer is not a difficult one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesus was definitely a person of color,&#8221; said Rev. Dr. Mark A. Lomax, pastor of First Afrikan Presbyterian Church in Lithonia, GA.</p>
<p>The question has been discussed for centuries. And it prompts another debate: Why does Jesus&rsquo; race matter?</p>
<p>According to Lomax, who is also an Associate Professor at the Interdenominational Theological Center, there is no historical matter that gives a clue of Jesus&rsquo; phenotype.</p>
<p>&#8220;But one thing that is known for sure, Jesus was not European. His people came from Egypt. Egyptians are dark skinned,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It cannot be argued that these people were African, said Reverend Derrick Rice, founding pastor of Sankofa United Church of Christ in Atlanta, GA.</p>
<p>&#8220;As contrite as this statement has become, we have arrived at a point where anthropological evidence shows these people were definitely African,&#8221; Rice said.</p>
<p>He references John&rsquo;s description of Jesus in Revelations as substantial support to the argument of Jesus&rsquo; race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been conditioned to water it down. But you get these descriptions of wooly hair and feet of brass,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It might not hold up to scholarship, but what John dreamt was clear. You must wrestle with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The debate over Jesus&rsquo; race dates back to the late 60s, around the civil rights movement, according to Lomax. He said individuals like James Cone and other liberation theology architects began a &#8220;Jesus is black&#8221; push, but they were not referring to his phenotype.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were suggesting that Jesus is where black people are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cone, former AMEchurch Bishop Henry McNeil Turner, and Marcus Garvey began asking &#8216;where is our black God?&rsquo; when whites were saying their God is white and Asians were saying their God is yellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But should we care? Should it matter what Jesus&rsquo; racial identity was?</p>
<p>The experts say yes.</p>
<p>Lomax suggests knowing Jesus&rsquo; race helps all of us, not just members of the black community. Possessing this truth, he believes, allows the black community the freedom to see that their skin color is not an issue for God.</p>
<p>&#8220;So why is it for us?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Rice said he cannot &#8220;hate on those&#8221; who don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s important, but thinks we all should.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vincent L. Wimbush, professor of religion at Claremont Graduate University and director of the Institute for Signifying Scriptures, suggests something more. He thinks it is important, but also believes the focus should be shifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes without knowing it, we project our own collective selves on a figure, whether it is a religious deity or even a heroic figure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Projection has always been a part of human history.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the sake of peace, he said, it is important for us to understand what we are doing. Projection and mirroring is perfectly okay and psychologically healthy, he argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;If something is more like you then you feel better about yourself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The problem would be when one community&rsquo;s image is forced upon every other community.&#8221;</p>
<p>As is the case of Jesus&rsquo; racial identity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lomax believes the truth is simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesus was minimally a person of color,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s just the reality.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Yes, Jesus was black. Along with Hannibal, the ancient Chinese, Egyptians, Greeks and Israelites, and Beethoven. I&rsquo;m so proud to have such a great race with not only such current great intellectual presence in our communities but also with such great past accomplishments as well. Articles like this continue to reaffirm my non-biased liberal mind of both their past and present importance.</p>

		<p>Why do blacks care what color was Jesus? Because everything is about color to them - they have race consciousness <i>ad absurdum.</i> Like the notion of &#8220;class&#8221; to the Marxists, there isn&rsquo;t a single issue of more than individual interest into which they can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t inject some theme of race.</p>

		<p>Jesus is clearly not a Northwestern European. The real question might be, did Jesus ever truly exist. See here, <a href="https://www.truthbeknown.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.truthbeknown.com/</a> </p>
<p>In this current age making Jesus a non-white is just a means of supporting white genocide. That area of the world was the crossroads of the nations, Jesus could have been anything, if he even existed. </p>

		<p>All of this is absurd:</p>
<p>1) Egyptians were not universally black (some were, including some minor Pharaohs, but not the most important and intelligent people); </p>
<p>2) the Revelation of John says that, in the vision, Jesus&rsquo; hair was &#8220;white as wool,&#8221; not &#8220;wooly.&#8221; I suppose if he had said, &#8220;white as snow&#8221; that these blockheads would be saying that Jesus was a snowman?</p>
<p>But, as a moral pagan, I must point out that all of this shows how easily, and seemingly without a fight, Christianity can be co-opted by &#8220;the least of these.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Christianity caters to the least capable, the least intellectual, the least imaginative, the least feisty, the least romantic. It is a fall-back position for the un-achievers, and actually consoles them for being such; blesses them for being such, and offers eternal rewards for being such.<br>
 <br>
Europeans need a religion of us, by us, and for us. I find the seeds of this in rigorous, moral paganism. Even C.S. Lewis felt the romantic ethos of European paganism when he read the words, &#8220;Balder is dead; Balder the beautiful is dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides, Jesus (as portrayed in the gospels) never existed. </p>

		<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think Jesus was black and here&rsquo;s why. Of course I could be wrong.I believe in the Garden of Eden Cain, brother of Abel, and son of Adam and Eve, killed his brother Abel. And God was displeased with Cain and cursed him and his desecends with black skin. It is a fact all blacks have usually had a hard life with slavery, generally low intelligence, etc. I guess I&rsquo;m citing something I believe is in the bible, or certain versions of it. But I&rsquo;m not sure. But that is what I believe, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure others believe the same thing. </p>

		<p>An additional thought: I believe Christ was a white Jew and Jews are God&rsquo;s chosen people. Einsien, the smartest man who ever lived was a Jew. The men who created the atomic bomb, like Teller, were largely Jews. Meyer Lansky, the math genius, although a mobster was a Jew. Many, if not most of the richest and most successful people have been Jews. It&rsquo;s a matter of record. Yes there have been some successful blacks, but none have ever achieved what so many, and successful Jews have achieved. Jews always top I.Q. tests, even besting Asians. It&rsquo;s simply a fact. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;But one thing that is known for sure, Jesus was not European. His people came from Egypt. Egyptians are dark skinned,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans inundated the entire Mediterranean area and beyond for thousands of years, and there existed also Semites and Arabs as well, but the majority of the population in Egypt <br>
during the early and mid dynasty era were Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>There is so much evidence verifying that to claim otherwise is nonsense.  For example, King Tut, the pharoah these afro-centrist blacks like to claim is black, was DNA tested as having DNA in common with 70% of Brits and 50% of other Europeans.</p>

Ra-nofer, High Priest  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/3au6cue" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3au6cue</a></p>
<p>Blacks were restricted to the southern Nile Valley in what is now Sudan, and Ethiopa and points south.  The ones in Egypt during the dynasty era were marched there as slaves after being defeated many times by the Egyptians. Multiculturalism bred the mostly white population to the tan or brown look it has today. In its final years Egypt had high officials who were mulatto with a pharoah or two, but it was at a time when it was in serious decline with its glory days far behind.</p>
<p>These afrocentrists are grasping at straws trying to co-opt a history that isn&rsquo;t theirs, because they haven&rsquo;t any real accomplishments they can truthfully lay claim to, so, very simply, they&rsquo;re stealing someone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Historian Mary Lefkowitz, in her essay, Not Out of Africa, describes academics who sit and listen to afro-centrist speeches without bringing up the blatant lies connected to it or challenging the speaker in any way although they all know it is pure nonsense.  It&rsquo;s as if they are induging a child whose feelings can&rsquo;t be hurt by revealing his pretentions and lies, so they quietly listen.</p>
<p>The entire claim by these black charlatans about Egypt, Greece, Africa, and their roles in the histories of those countries, is really amazing, mostly because it reveals a truly moronic attempt that is so far-fetched and illogical only a fool would try to pass it off as the truth.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/7e8ppyo" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/7e8ppyo</a></p>
<p>Too, on another note, the group I.Q. average of Sudan is 72 and its neighbor, Ethiopia, is 63, and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe the ancient inhabitants of either area were any smarter. (I.Q. and Wealth of Nations)  I&rsquo;ve asked myself how these Afro-centrists can expect to be believed on that basis alone.  Are we to believe people who are mentally retarded built the pyramids?</p>

<p><br>
Doesn&rsquo;t that phrase just annoy the hell out of you? We are ALL people of color. White people are not really White and black people are not really black. We all have a color. But the context that this phrase is always used in is to be exclusionary of White people. I wonder how blacks would like it if a phrase was coined that represented all the worlds peoples, except for black people? </p>
<p>On the subject matter, I would say the only way to be 100% sure of the racial makeup of Christ, would be to do dna testing. And since no one knows where his body is, if it even exists, then the answer will remain unknown, maybe forever. If a black reverend wants to tell his congregation that Jesus was black, who really cares? blacks will just accept this and not require any proof. Just like in any number of other topics. Regardless they probably couldnt care less right now. Air Jordans are now in the stores. </p>

		<p>Notice the not-so-subtle &#8220;bait and switch&#8221; in this article. The headline reads &#8220;Why Do We Care If Jesus Was Black?&#8221; (Apparently, anyone who believes that Jesus was white is  petty and shallow). </p>
<p>Then it quotes several black preachers  who insist that Jesus was indeed black (Hispanics, who probably outnumber black Christians, may not be happy to hear this either, but they are ignored in this article). Notice that no alternative viewpoints are given. </p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;re told that it&rsquo;s important for all of us to believe this &#8220;truth&#8221; because &#8220;it allows the black community the freedom to see that their skin color is not an issue for God.&#8221; </p>
<p>In other words, it should not matter to whites what skin color Jesus was, but it should matter very much to blacks.</p>
<p>Bait and switch.</p>

- Mashaun D. Simon, The Grio, December 25, 2011</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
A craniofacial study by C. Loring Brace et al. (1993) concluded that: &#8220;The Predynastic of Upper Egypt and the Late Dynastic of Lower Egypt are more closely related to each other than to any other population. As a whole, they show ties with the European Neolithic, North Africa, modern Europe, and, more remotely, India, but not at all with sub-Saharan Africa,<br>

Jesus was a Jew. The Jews are Semites. The Semites are Caucasians. Artists who portray Jesus as a Nordic err, but they would err more if they portrayed him as black. </p>

		<p>There is absolutely no evidence that the historical Jesus was anything but a Jew, a member of a populous, probably Semitic, race or tribe centered in the middle East during the reign of August Caesar, who lived from 63 B.C. - 14 A.D.  There were distinctive communities of Jews throughout the Levant, Greece, and much of Roman Asia Minor, including Rome itself.  They were NOT Egyptians, who were a melange of Arab and Greek peoples at that time. Cleopatra herself, who died in 30 B.C., was the last of the Ptolemaic (Greek) line of pharaohs who had ruled Egypt for almost 300 years, and Alexandria was a Greek city, as were many other large cities in Egypt at the time. There is no evidence that blacks were even or ever a large minority within Egypt at any time.  In other words, even if Jesus&rsquo; forebears were Egyptian, he would still not be black.  Moreover, the biblical tracts trace Jesus&rsquo; origins back to the House of David, he was born and raised in Judea among Jews.  This is a canard that has been around, and unconvincing, for 50 years.  (Just like Hannibal being black, which he was not.) </p>

		<p>&ldquo;But one thing that is known for sure, Jesus was not European. His people came from Egypt. Egyptians are dark skinned,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>The misinformation proffered by this statement is that &#8220;Jesus&#8221; was an Egyptian, because Jews came from Egypt.  Today Egyptians are dark skinned, but they were a different people 2,000 years ago, so saying &#8220;Egyptians are a dark skinned people&#8221; ought to sound in the &#8220;so what?&#8221; register.  Anyway, the best archeology to date shows that Jews were likely Canaanites that rebelled against a bad ruler, and the entirety of Genesis and Exodus were likely written when they were in captivity in Babylon.  The books were written to bind the people as an ethnic group, giving them a stronger identity.  Modern archeology also shows that there were few is any slaves involved in building the pyramids or monuments of Egypt. They were build by regular people who dedicated part of their lives building as their religious service, much the way it was done in other places in the world, such as Stonehenge.  So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if Egyptians were dark or not because Hebrews/Jews didn&rsquo;t live there in any large portion, and they did not take their belief system from Egypt.  It is important to remember that primarily, Jewish is a religion.</p>
<p>It is true however, that &#8220;Jesus&#8221; could not have been a European, and the representation of him as a European is as erroneous as a black one.  Jesus would have been a Semite, related to Arabs in looks.  Genetic research has been done and it has been demonstrated that he would have been Middle Eastern in stature, hair color, eye color, and bearing.  The early Church knew this, but the transformation of a typically Hebrew looking Jesus changed over time to look more like Northern Europeans.  This may be what is actually behind some old Protestant beliefs that attempt to assert that Jesus wasn&rsquo;t a Jew.</p>

		<p>&#8220;His people came from Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong, of course; Joseph and Mary fled INTO Egypt to escape Herod. The genealogy of Jesus (actually, the Gospels provide two accounts) is completely non-Egyptian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus was minimally a person of color,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Minimally a person of color:&#8221; a weasel phrase if ever there was one. Kim-Jong Il was a &#8220;person of color. So were Sitting Bull, Chairman Mao, and Genghis Khan. That does not mean any of them was black.</p>

		<p>The article contains Scripture that has been grossly misused. I will provide more of the verses and it does not help the Afrocentrists&rsquo; case.</p>
<p>The verses he is talking about are Revelation 1:14,15. Anyone can read these verses and see that they say:</p>
<p>&#8220;His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow, and His eyes were like a flame of fire. His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>1. Blacks are never described by people as having white heads, whatever color their hair is.</p>
<p>2. The comparison to wool being followed with snow means that the verse is plainly emphasizing the color white. Wool and snow do not have a similar texture, so it seems clear that the verse is not saying the hair was woolly (read: Afro-textured hair).</p>
<p>3. Black people do not have bronze skin. No humans who have ever lived have skin that looks like bronze glowing in a furnace.</p>
<p>4. The book of Revelation has a lot of figurative language. While walking around on Earth, Jesus was a Semite of the Middle East, not from Egypt or sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

		<p>I once saw a chinese jesus painting.  It is sort of like how the Buddha, who was an Indian from India, was turned chinese by converts in china.</p>
<p>Everyone wants a hero who looks like them.  As poster #2 noted, jesus was semitic, which however is not exactly &#8216;caucasian&rsquo; in the sense of say a nordic blond, which is how most of think when we hear the word &#8216;caucasian&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>The caucasians are a very diverse bunch and contain subgroups from places as far flung as northern India, the arab word an on into europe.  Many caucasian populations on the fringe zones have intermingled with other races and so you find black arabs, brown jews, &#8216;latino&rsquo; mestizos and even white/asian hybrids in places like the ukraine.</p>
<p>I think it is very wrong to have the jesus images and paintings showing some white dude with white skin and chestnut or blond hair.  But for people to claim he was &#8216;african&rsquo; that&rsquo;s just way off the mark.</p>
<p>The reason is because when they say &#8216;african&rsquo; what they mean is the kunta kinte, west african, bantu type of person, which no one north of the sahara is.</p>

		<p>No, Jesus wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;white&#8221; like a Swede or Norwegian is white, but he certainly wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;black&#8221; either. </p>
<p>Jesus was a Caucasian of Semitic extraction - probably baring somewhat of a resemblence to a modern-day Palestinian or Syrian. </p>
<p>Blacks were (and still are) a primitive culture. The cold, hard truth is that they were worshipping fire and snakes when Europeans were debating philosophy and theology within the Church. </p>
<p>Getting to a deeper issue, however, this is a major reason why I have an issue with Christianity, despite being raised a Christian and still considering myself a nominal Christian. I am comfortable with the notion of Jesus being a dark-skinned Semite, because the reality is that is most likely what he was. But he was by no means a sub-Saharan African! </p>
<p>I have an issue with the fact that blacks, who are relatively recent converts to Christianity (300 - 400 yrs. ago), are trying to tell the rest of us who have been Christians for thousands of years that our holy figure, Jesus Christ, is &#8220;one of them&#8221;.  </p>
<p>As I said, blacks were worshipping fire and snakes a mere 400 years ago and would still be doing so had the Arabs not brought Islam to Africa and the Europeans not brought Christianity to Africa. </p>
<p>The blacks try to claim Jesus as one of them because the passive nature of Christianity has allowed them to do so. Let them try to claim that Muhammed was black and see what reaction they get from the Arabs. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Jesus was minimally a person of color,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Person of color&#8221; is an umbrella some blacks have created, which indicates they believe&hellip;.or want to believe&hellip;or want others to believe&hellip;&hellip;that all people of color are the same, and all of them are the polar opposites of whites.</p>
<p>However, the fact is that blacks have less in common with  people of color than they do whites.  And, &#8220;people of color&#8221; themselves, besides blacks, are also very much unlike one another in many ways.</p>
<p>Do blacks really have anything in common with Amerindians? Asian Indians?  Latins? Middle Easterners? Pakis? North, East or South Asians?  Do these groups have much in common with each other?  The answer of course is &#8220;no.&#8221;  And every one of them would be insulted if it were ever suggested they are in the same category in every way as blacks.</p>
<p>If there were no whites at all in this country, these same groups would be fighting and hating each other and blacks would be fighting with everybody.  In fact they do just that wherever they live in close proximity to one another in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;People of Color&#8221; is a political category concocted by mostly blacks, with far left radicals taking up the mantra from time to time.  It&rsquo;s just as big a lie as claiming Jesus was black or that the Egyptians were as well.</p>
<p>Too, it should be noted that by putting themselves under this umbrella, the black leadership hopes black lack of achievements and numerous failures won&rsquo;t be as noticeable, especially since they lag behind all the other &#8220;people of color&#8221; in everything.</p>

		<p>Egyptians were a Berber people and were Caucasian. Arabs are Caucasian, Berbers are Caucasian, the ancient Phoenicians and Carthaginians like Hannibal were Caucasian, the people of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India are mostly Caucasian. They are a different branch than we are but they are Caucasian, not black. The ancient Egyptians were in the unenviable position of living along the only real corridor from Sub-Saharan Africa the the blacks were capable of traversing. I feel for them having to have that thorn in their side. COLOR IS NOT THE PRIMARY DETERMINANT OF RACE! Only ignorant idiots rely on that phenotypic trait as the main sign. Caucasians and Asian Mongoloids run from completely pale white in color to quite tan indeed. That does not mean that they are black!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough when those blacks are trying to claim geniuses like Hannibal as their kinsmen but now they claim that Jesus was one of them, too. Impossible!</p>

Pontius Pilate wrote a letter to Emperor Tiberius the time that Jesus Christ was crucified.

It seems that the more learned you become, the more you become a communist.<br>
There were no such thing as &#8220;jews&#8221; in the time of Pontius Pilate. <br>
Jesus Christ was not a jew, He was a Judean. Read the dissertation of Benjamin Freedman.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Jesus was a Jew. The Jews are Semites. The Semites are Caucasians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The classical definition of Caucasian is for those living (originally North of the Caucasus Mountains), and West of the Urals.  Semites are only more closely related to them because of a very long history of slave trading and abduction.  The modern trend to call Semites Caucasians is a political one used for example, by Turks in their argument that they ought to be allowed into the EU.  (Turks in fact are not even Semites, they are Turkic, whose tribes extended (and still do) all the way to Northern China and are Central Asian, not Middle Eastern.  Also, the region of the Caucasus have been invaded and ravaged/settled so many times in the past 1,000 years that we can effectively count the inhabitants as more Semite than European.</p>

		<p>As a Jewish geneticist all I can state is that Yeshouah ha-Notzri ( Jesus of Nazareth in Hebrew)was a brown-olive complexioned dark haired, dark brown eyed Semitic man from the middle east ( west Asiatic)- Jesus was a Mizrahi Jew.<br>
Jesus would more accurately resemble someone from the Middle east, Iran or North Western India. One thing for sure, he was Caucasian ( more like Arabs, Jews, East Indians, Iranians), but by no means was he a blonde blue eyed white skinned European and there was not a chance that he was black! The Afro-centerists are deluded!</p>
<p>This is what Jesus would have looked like, according to leading experts in Archaeology &amp; Anthropology in the western world.</p>

		<p>The Bible was translated, and then re-translated again, and then once more, to the point where scholars and theologians debate about whether or not Moses encountered a burning &#8220;bush&#8221; or a &#8220;beard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;hair of wool&#8221; and &#8220;feet of bronze&#8221; debate has been there at least since Malcolm X brought it up as proof positive that Jesus was black. Let&rsquo;s start with the hair. Recall that two-thousand years ago there was no hair conditioner. If you bathed frequently, that meant once a week. Sand storms were a constant burden, and most travel was done by foot or pack animal. Even if you were born with the straightest, fine blond hair, in a couple of months it would be of &#8220;wool.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the feet of bronze, if you&rsquo;ve ever looked at suntan products, the word &#8220;bronzing&#8221; invariably is used somewhere in the product. Black people are not bronze. People who are of a lighter complexion who spend time in the sun become bronze.</p>
<p>This is very simple. Human races evolved many millenia ago. No new races were created within the last couple of thousand years. If you want to know pretty much what Jesus looked like, go to the Middle East and see for yourself. He probably wasn&rsquo;t black or white. He was swarthy and semitic looking. </p>
<p>Most overly-Anglo looking depictions of Christ are based on one of the Pope&rsquo;s nephews who sat for a commissioned portrait and agreed to stand in for Christ.</p>
<p>And can somebody please explain this statement to me: <br>
&#8220;As contrite as this statement has become, we have arrived at a point where anthropological evidence shows these people were definitely African.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I thought this was already figured out. Jesus may have been a man of &#8220;color&#8221; but his color was not black. Egyptians were not black. Not white, but certainly not black. Just because Egypt is a country in Africa does not make the people black. Look at the Egyptians now for instance. </p>
<p>Jesus wasn&rsquo;t some  long, blond haired, blue eyed, white hippie, no. But he was also not some cotton haired black guy. Jesus would have been arab in color, tannish skin tone. Short hair, perhaps curlyish(1 Corinthians 11:14),  with dark hair and eyes, most likely. He would have been nothing special to look at because he did not wish that people follow him for his looks, but for his message as being God in the flesh. Not that tall. He might have even been considered ugly by today&rsquo;s standards. He would most likely have been a rugged looking man as a carpenter in that time period. Not some effeminate hippie like in today&rsquo;s pictures. (Isaiah 53:2-5)</p>

		<p>Does it really matter? To some yes and to others no. But I would have to agree that in the region where Jesus was born, yes, he was a man of color. There&rsquo;s no way a European could live in such a hot region and not have color. Jesus features weren&rsquo;t european either. In America, Jesus has been seen as white with white features to reflect the majority of the country, but Jesus wasn&rsquo;t White. Of course,even if he was there wouldn&rsquo;t be anything wrong with it. It&rsquo;s like 30 years from now they would try to state that &#8220;whites started hip-hop.&#8221; Obviously it isn&rsquo;t true, but if those from the past aren&rsquo;t alive to refute it, a new generation may believe it.

		<p>JESUS was a Jew, that is clear, and the Jews have an amazing racial continuity, over 3,300 years and even more perhaps. So it is reasonable to assume the Jews of the time of JESUS looked more or less as the Jews today. And the Jews today are generally categorized as a white race so the chances are that JESUS would probably be best defined as white, as we understand that term to mean today.</p>
<p>And OF COURSE to some folks this is a subject of major proportions BUT not so to almost anyone else. Those folks that it is a subject of major proportions to have esteem issues big time and need a boost, even if it is totally fiction and a fabrication.

		<p>how is it that blackies put so much effort into taking credit as well as everything else that is White? Do they really believe they have earned these right&rsquo;s, are they really that stupid or are we that ignorant to cater to them? Now having said that, I&rsquo;m sure the next headline will be from la raza claiming Jesus was hispanic.<br>
MY Father,why has thou forsaken me?</p>

		<p>The shroud of Turin gives us the best example of what Jesus may have looked like. Since no one has disproven it&rsquo;s miraculous creation. I would say that Jesus was definitely not black. </p>
<p>Perhaps somewhat darker than some depictions of him but definitely not black. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood this worship of Jesus. Ok, the guy tried to get people to be nice to one another and got nailed to a tree for his trouble. But to take that and figure that Jesus and a belief in God will some how bail you out of a bad situation is not logical and defies all evidence that in a bad situation you are on your own.</p>

		<p>I am a black man who was born in Africa during my five decades on earth, I have enjoyed elements of modernity like planes, medicines, transport, education courtesy of white discovery for the most part. I love and respect my race. We all agree that most inventions by white people have made life easy for everyone and are not seen as a &#8220;white&#8221;. Jesus might have been white or black or green but it does not matter. The message of Jesus and Christianity is Universal in almost all cultures even if we have defaulted at times: Thou Shall not steal, Love one another and LOVE your neighbor as yourself. What has color got to do with this salient philosophy of salvation, meditation, exhortation, wisdom and even daily living?</p>

		<p>The Romans had described the man that was to be scourged and crucified by the demand of the Jews, under Pilot, and they don&rsquo;t describe a black man. </p>
<p>Jesus was an Israelite Preacher, and the Romans had nothing to gain from HIS being described as a White man, or black man, since they were Pagans. </p>
<p>The Shroud of Turin clearly shows a White man who was scourged, and whose likeness was imprinted on the burial cloth. </p>
<p>I read that HIS people were to have come from Egypt, according to the article. Well, it was recently shown through DNA testing, that the Pharohs were of Celtic lineage, so here again, we can assume from this that HE was also a White man. </p>

		<p>je suis paganisme: <i>&#8220;Europeans need a religion of us, by us, and for us. I find the seeds of this in rigorous, moral paganism </i>&#8220;</p>
<p>Which is primarily why I have begun to explore Taoism. Even though I know that Taoism is Asian, much of my ancestry is Ashkenazic Jewish and the Ashkenazic Jews originate primarily in Asia with some Middle Eastern DNA infusion.</p>
<p>Taoism lets me continue to believe in a God/Greater Force &#8220;the Tao&#8221; but I do so in my own terms and through my own understanding without all of the guilt-laden doctrine of Judaism and Christianity. Also, the Taoist view of a higher being is more spiritually mature and advanced as Taoists do not believe in an anthropomorphic deity who is vengeful, jealous and embodying all of the worst qualities of man.</p>
<p>When I hear blacks talk of God, it is almost as if they think God is literally some Santa Claus-looking man figure who will give them what they want, when they want as long as they go to church and scream his name, yell at the top of their lungs and roll on the floor. </p>
<p>I thought about converting to Christianity from Judaism for a time, but then I thought about how Christianity turns its followers, particularly men, into castrated little boys who are supposed to do what their pastor tells them, believe every bit of doctrine they read, embrace egalitarianism and hand over their money to the &#8220;starving children in Africa&#8221; or the &#8220;underprivileged children of Detroit&#8221;, etc. etc. </p>
<p>Christianity is literally being used by blacks to transfer money from whites and white families to themselves and it goes on all of the time. Further, white Christians are never supposed to ask any questions because it to do so would &#8220;offend Jesus&#8221;.</p>
<p>If I ever do embrace Christianity, it will be with the still somewhat nationalistic Eastern Orthodox churches.  </p>

<p>&#8220;This tendency to depict a revered figure as one of one&rsquo;s own race is very common and also very human. It shouldn&rsquo;t bother us so much that Blacks want to depict Jesus as a Black man, Northern Europeans tend to depict Jesus as a Nordic man, which for him being a Jew is also wrong. East Asians usually depict the Buddha as a Mongolian man,while in fact he was an Indian.It&rsquo;s a human thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely. There is nothing wrong whatsoever about blacks depicting Jesus as a black man. Our brains (like those of all pack animals) are hardwired to divide people into our own kind and aliens, and differences in appearance are used as perceptive guidelines in that. Clothing and other such things are obviously important (which is why subcultures tend to develop their own distinctive fashions), but nothing really beats skin colour and facial structure. It is not good that a Christian, looking at a picture of differently coloured Jesus, has a part of his brain screaming &#8220;alien!&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, not being content with depicting Christ as a member of one&rsquo;s own race, and actually claiming that he was, objectively, one of your race, goes way beyond the understandable reaction of human beings to their own frailties. It is a symptom of racial monomania. It crosses the line between racial consciousness and pathological racism.</p>

		<p>Everything that can reasonably be surmised about Jesus indicates that he was a Galilean Jew.  Galilee was not known as a place of black habitation in his time, just as that area is not known for having a black population today.  He was very likely a Semite, neither European nor African in appearance.  Mark Lomax&rsquo;s assertion that Jesus was black is transparently self-serving.  I could also say that it shows he is not a careful scholar, but I honesty don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a scholar at all, just a racial polemicist.</p>

		<p>The important thing to know about Jesus, perhaps the most important is that we are all related to him and to God, by adoption.  That means anyone, ANYONE can choose to follow Jesus and become of him&hellip;..related to him by blood.  That&rsquo;s the real meaning of communion that Jesus changed it to.</p>
<p>Christianity is all about what is in your heart rather than legalisms.  Remember what Jesus called those with supposedly the proper blood lines but who secretly worshipped bhall murdering babies in his name and doing all matter of evil while wearing the right clothes and giving lip service to belief in God.  He called them the synagogue of satan.</p>
<p>It does not matter what &#8220;race&#8221; Jesus was.  Probably the only person besides Adam and Eve where race is literally not an issue because of the purity of the humanity he is and the relationship between him and God and us.  All others, race is just another word for family.</p>
<p>And the purpose of asking this question is rooted in evil, at least in this case.  The ones asking the question hate Jesus, hate God and serve satan.  Their goal is one of denial.  Denial of the divinity of Jesus.  Denial of salvation through loving relationship with him.  And an attempt to deny access of people to salvation by inappropriate claiming ownership of him not out of love but out of sick perversion.  They do not worship Jesus&hellip;.they want a basis to call us &#8220;white devils&#8221;&hellip;that is the bottom line.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that you can say that Jesus didn&rsquo;t look the way he is depicted now and he certainly wasn&rsquo;t black! It is a huge assumption that an ancient middle easterner couldn&rsquo;t look Nordic. </p>
<p>Some of the tribes of the middle east, even some of the Semitic tribes like the Amorites, believed to be close relatives of the ancient Hebrews, as were the Aramaeans, were described in terms that make them sound Nordic. </p>
<p>The Amorites were tall and were often blond and blue-eyed. Even the 1967 World Book Encyclopedia (before the political correctness police completely took over scholarship) article &#8220;Race&#8221; says the the Amorites and Kurds of the middle east are Nordics. The Jews may have picked up a lot of Armenoid, Alpine, and Iranian Plateau local race phenotypic characteristics over the millenia. This seems to be the case for some Jews.</p>
<p>King David was 1/4 Moabite and part Hittite and had some other mixture in him. The Hebrews were a mixed people from early times. They probably originated as a people and had long resided in what is now Syria. </p>
<p>The Khazars were a bi-racial confederation that may have included both Mongoloid and Caucasoid Turks, Iranian speaking Caucasian nomads (Scythian and Sarmatian peoples), and even Caucasian Finnic speaking nomads (similar to the early Magyars, Hungarians).  They may have included people of Nordic, Cro-Magnon,  Mediteranean, Armenoid, Alpine, Iranian Plateau, Uralic type Caucasians, and Mongol type Mongoloid (the Baikal types A and B).</p>
<p>Linguist and scholar Professor Wexler of Tel Aviv University applies linguistic detective work along with other methods to state that modern Ashkenazi Jews are a mixture of mostly ancient Balkan Slavs, the Sorbs (related to the Serbs, who moved northwest into close proximity with Germanic people later), Balkan and Anatolian converts (who are known to be a mixture of Mediteranean and Armenoid with some Nordic), and Avar Mongols of the Balkans (who came from Mongolia and were known by the Chinese as the Juan Juan) and hardly any ancestry from the ancient Hebrews. </p>
<p>Wexler said that Jews descended from these peoples in the following order: Balkan Slavs (Sorbs), Avar Mongols, Anatolian converts, other Balkan peoples, other Europeans. Wexler says that the Sephardic (Spanish and Moraccan) Jews are mostly descended from Berbers and Arabs (in that order) from the Maghreb, North Africa, mainly Morocco. </p>
<p>Modern Jews are certainly not 100% middle eastern! But the Hebrews and Jesus were without a doubt Caucasian! Jesus could very well have looked exactly like the depictions of him (or even more Nordic). </p>

<p>Jews of the Bible do NOT have to resemble Jews today! The Jews you are referring to are Ashkhenaz Jews - the original Mizrahi Jews mixed with Eurasian Jews who settled in central Europe, I happen to be one of them. However, the Biblical Jews known as &#8220;Mizrahis&#8221; were dark complexioned semitic people (which includes Jesus Christ). Mizrahi Jews still make up the majority of Israel&rsquo;s population are often mistaken for Arabs, North Indians or Iranians.</p>
<p>This is what Mizrahis ( original Biblical Jewish people) look like:</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before. Please refrain from looping Jews with whites. We bear no ill-will towards any race. We just want to maintain our distinct ethno-racial identity. Verdict: Jews are NOT white! Neither are Arabs or Persians or Latinos! The United States Population Census is nonsense&hellip;it loops Arabs, Jews, Persians, Central Asians etc as white. The only whites are indigenous people of ANY European ethnicity. Case closed. Period</p>

Plus, I did not have to wimp out and turn the other cheek, give to whomever asked of me (even if I knew I was being taken advantage of), love my enemies, etc. Plus Steinberg pointed out reasons why the Jesus of the gospels was not really such an admirable character.</p>
<p>I also read the Analects of Confucius, in which he said, &#8220;If we love our enemies, how will we show affection to our friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>But yes, in the end, who needs a jealous, vengeful psycho for a God? </p>
<p>Or all that namby-pamby Jesus-freak contrived fake-love?</p>

<p>Tacitus, Pliny the younger and Serotonius, all respected Roman historians wrote the there was a Jewish heretic who founded a new sect, was executed in the reign of Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor and that his followers spread the new religion and caused a lot of trouble in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>He was a Jew and Jews are White.  Of course the religion he created is now a major enemy of Whites with its suicidal tendencies of giving everything we have to the blacks and browns.</p>
<p>Maybe he was an Obama Manchurian candidate all along and it took 2,000 years to reveal his White genocide program.</p>

		<p>The previous posts contain some sense and much contradictory nonsense.<br>
I am working on an academic study of the ethnic identity and probable appearance of Jesus of Nazareth, hopefully to be completed next year with extensive documentation.<br>
No firm indications of his appearance exist in the NT, but he was quite certainly not a black African, and the Popular Mechanics &#8220;reconstruction&#8221; of his physiognomy lacks scientific merit. It is sometimes suggested that he was small in stature because of a response by Origen to the pagan critic Celsus and of a misreading of an incident where someone has to climb a tree to observe him among his followers, but the overall gospel impression is that of a leader of majestic stature.<br>
The Letter of Pilate (quoted above) and the Letter of Lentulus are not authentic, but blue eyes were not rare in Palestine at that period, and hailed as a &#8220;son of David&#8221; he might be expected also to have a noticeably fair complexion like his OT &#8220;predecessor&#8221;.<br>
Anyone interested in the actual arguments used by NT scholars like Walter Grundmann that Jesus may have not have been a Jew should begin with Peter Head&rsquo;s article, &#8220;The Nazi Quest for an Aryan Jesus&#8221;, in the Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus, in 2004.</p>

<p>I have noticed that modern geneticists have thrown all previous physical anthropology, history, and archaeology regarding human variation in the dustbin. They often do not even know a thing about those disciplines. That is sheer hubris. I have also noticed that studies by Jewish gentecists tend overwhelmingly to show a near 100% descent to a very high percentage descent from ancient Hebrews which is laughable but some deluded people think that that is important for a claim to that little piece of the middle east which is such a thorn in the side of the American people. </p>
<p>History, anthropology, and archaeology show that there was an immense mixture of peoples in the ancient Fertile Crescent. King David, an ancestor of Jesus according to the Bible, had red hair and was part Hittite (an Indo-European poeple who&rsquo;s original pre-Anatolian population was Nordic), part Moabite, and had further admixture with other nations.  The Amorites were semitic but were widely reported to be very tall and to have blond hair and blue eyes. There were many Indo-Europeans who at least had many individuals of Nordic type among them in the Fertile crescent, too. I believe it was Isaac Asimov in his guide to the Bible who explained King David&rsquo;s ancestry and who showed how mixed it was.</p>
<p>In fact, physical anthropologist Carlton C. Coon showed that many of the Bedouin are of Nordic type (surprisingly) and he produced many photographs that showed Nordic type Bedouins. </p>
<p>As for the appearance of Jesus, who drew that picture?!!! It is very unflattering! I have suspicions about the motives of the artist or group that produced that drawing. There are many Mediteranean and Armenoid or Iranian Plateau types who are much more handsome than that. That guy is much homelier than the average Mediteranean. He might make a good comedian, though. Many Meditaranean men are handsome. It seems like a subconcious or a concious attack on Jesus. I suspect that Jesus might have been more handsome than that. The average man is.  Jesus might have had a Meditaranean appearance but many, many inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent were of various other types. Jesus as a black man, that is deluded. We are in agreement on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make you a gentleman&rsquo;s bet that you could not look at my DNA and say how I look and you probably could not tell what my complete ancestry is. You might be able to make some rough guesses about parts of my ancestry but you couldn&rsquo;t pin it down very accurately, I suspect.  Just following one x chromosomal line and one y chromosomal line doesn&rsquo;t cut it for me. </p>

<p>Nestor, I really don&rsquo;t know where you learned your anthropology. What do you think that &#8220;white&#8221; means? If you mean Nordic, then please say so. Otherwise, you are using the term incorrectly and imprecisely.</p>
<p>I studied human heredity and physical anthropology and the most logical and traditional approach is that it means the entire Caucasian Race which includes most Europeans and their descendents and also Arabs, Jews, Berbers, Iranians, most of the people of India, and others. I have seen some of those people with the bright and rather strangely shaded red hair in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I have read that some of them apply henna to make their hair red because Mohammed was supposed to have had red hair. Also, Pashtuns are Caucasians! They are Indo-European speakers and their remote Indo-European ancestors were of Nordic type but they mixed with a lot of non-Nordic Caucasians and their genes eventually got swamped by South Asian Caucasians of Mediteranean and Iranian Plateau type. You should read the article in this sites archives about the race of the ancient Greeks. This is the same thing. Any red or blond hair among them was likely inherited from their ancient Indo-European ancestors. If you think that those people prove that red hair is common among non-whites I say it is just the opposite, it means that besides being white in the sense of being Caucasian, they probably have some Nordic type ancestors and there are people right there in that region who are of that type and they confuse the less educated. Case in point, the Nuristanis! Their ancestors were Nordic and they are still largely Nordic. They are apparently another branch of the real Aryans, the Aryan tribal cofederation that conquered India in 1500 B.C. Up until recently, they still worshipped the same Aryan gods that the first Aryan conquerors of India worshipped.https://www.google.com/search?q=nuristanis+pictures&hl;=en&prmd;=imvnsfd&tbm;=isch&tbo;=u&source;=univ&sa;=X&ei;=paf6TpnoHY_tggeMt-yiAg&sqi;=2&ved;=0CCkQsAQ&biw;=1280&bih;=587 <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nuristani_people" rel="nofollow">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nuristani_people</a></p>
<p>In the pre-1492 world the center of dispersion of red hair was the British Isles and Norway and it radiated out in frequency from there (like weather isotherms but caused by genetic relationship). That also means that those areas have a high incidence of strawberry blond hair. The area with the highest incidence of blue eyes was Ireland and it radiated out in diminishing fruquency from there. The highest frequency of platinum or ash blond hair was on the East Baltic shores. That include people of the Nordic local race in Sweden and those of the East Baltic local race in Poland and Byelorus (White Russia, named after the blondness of the people). </p>
<p>But there were Indo-European dispersions throughout Europe and Asia starting about 3,000 B.C. or earlier. Those people were initially Nordic but mixed and sometimes eventually became genetically swamped by the local population (which was usually also white, Caucasian, but not always Nordic). There are also Cro-Magnon remnant populations in many regions. They were often rufous (red haired) or blond, just like Nordics. They were slightly different physically from Nordics. They had a heavier bone sturcture, higher more prominent cheekbones, heavier and very powerful musculature, a shorter and wider face, slightly more prominent brow ridges than most people now but much less so and different than Neanderthal, a dolichocephalic but somewhat pentagonal shape of head, and a very large cranial capacity (and brain!) of 1600 c.c. Some areas still have mostly Cro-Magnon people like Dalarna, Sweden. There are known to have been largely Cro-Magnon populations in parts of England, France, and Spain, too. We also know what their coloring was like because the original Guanches, natives of the Canary Islands, were pure Cro-Magnon and living off of the coast of North Africa! There are also mummies of some of the original Guanches. They had blond or red hair often and the blond ones also tanned well (also common among some of those ash blonds of the East Baltic). Some groups have thought that they were descendents of Atlanteans!  They were quite a good looking, intelligent, and athletic folk. Later the Guanches got mixed with other races and were no longer very Cro-Magnon. Some Nordics have mixed with them to some degree. Look up Cro-Magnon in an old Ecyclopaedia Britannica. The cultural marxists have mudied the waters and lied about Cro-Magnon and do not allow Cro-Magnon to be discussed now.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the terms ruddy, rufous, and red-haired are redundant when used together. Skin color is a poor designation of race as the Caucasian or white race actually ranges from pale white to pinkish to dark brown but they are all caucasians. Many Nordics tan quite well, too. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no expert but the first thing I would ask is what do we know about Marys&rsquo; race? For those that believe that he is the son of God, and God, you would be hard pressed to convince me that her race,people,and place in life weren&rsquo;t part of Gods plan. </p>
<p>What do we know about Mary? Seems odd to me that her name isn&rsquo;t mentioned in any of the above posts. At Least I didn&rsquo;t see it. Sorry to anyone that did mention it and I failed to see it. </p>
<p>Also like I said I&rsquo;m no expert but what clues does Luke 1 30-32 tell us? I really am looking for answers from some more biblically knowledgeable then I am. </p>
<p>The argument that because we don&rsquo;t have a DNA sample we don&rsquo;t know anything about his race seems stupid. </p>
<p>Of Course the premise of the articles writer (Mashaun D. Simon), that we should base the race of Jesus on a vague, selective passages describing how he looked in relative terms at moment in time is over the top stupid.      </p>

		<p>In response to #73:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noticed that modern geneticists have thrown all previous physical anthropology, history, and archaeology regarding human variation in the dustbin. They often do not even know a thing about those disciplines. That is sheer hubris.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolute balderdash! No they have NOT! Please show me clear evidence to support your claim! I&rsquo;m a geneticist in a reputed lab in the North east, I know what I&rsquo;m talking about, sir!  </p>
<p>&#8220;I have also noticed that studies by Jewish gentecists tend overwhelmingly to show a near 100% descent to a very high percentage descent from ancient Hebrews which is laughable but some deluded people think that that is important for a claim to that little piece of the middle east which is such a thorn in the side of the American people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did make it clear, that many modern day European Jewry may or may not claim genetic descent from the original Biblical Jews of Israel. That is because the very Jewish identity, especially in the western world is a complex one. </p>
<p>The original Biblical Jews were dark complexioned descendants of Hittites, who were an Asiatic race ( NOT white)- they are Semitic descendants of the ancient Hittites. <br>
The Hittities may have been a Bronze age Indo-European people just like the Persians, Bactrians ( Afghans) and Indians, but that still does NOT make them white or European! If what you claim was even remotely true, than one should see clear evidence, for which there is NONE! And if you are so willing to call Hittites &#8220;white&#8221;, you might as well include other Indo-Europeans like Indians, Persians &amp; Afghans as white too!</p>
<p>Western Jews today include Askhenaz Khazarians who were mixed race group between the original brown skinned Mizrahi Jews &amp; olive complexioned Eurasians of the Caucas region of Eurasia. In time many Khazarian Jews who settled in Europe mixed with white gentiles to create more European looking Jews which you find today. That still makes them non-white or mixed race. In addition, there are quite a few white European gentile neo-converts ( mostly through marriage with Jews) who assume the Jewish identity. Thus it can be argued that Jews are both a race and a religious identity. Either ways, that still implies that the ancient Jews of Biblical times i.e. Mizrahi Jews ( from Abraham,David to Jesus) were dark complexioned brown skinned men who would most probably resemble a common man from modern day Israel, Arabia, Northern India or Iran!</p>

<p>Actually the &#8220;Indians&#8221;never invented the wheel as well. There were some toys found in either Aztec or Inca ruins. They represented little animals that were pulled along on strings. They had wheels yet it never occurred to them that they could use them for practical purposes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Linguist and scholar Professor Wexler of Tel Aviv University applies linguistic detective work along with other methods to state that modern Ashkenazi Jews are a mixture of mostly ancient Balkan Slavs, the Sorbs (related to the Serbs, who moved northwest into close proximity with Germanic people later), Balkan and Anatolian converts (who are known to be a mixture of Mediteranean and Armenoid with some Nordic), and Avar Mongols of the Balkans (who came from Mongolia and were known by the Chinese as the Juan Juan) and hardly any ancestry from the ancient Hebrews.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When most ancient writers wrote of &#8220;red&#8221; hair I&rsquo;m fairly sure they were referring to reddish-brown which is regarded as red, not the carrot top look.  Reddish-brown hair is not uncommon even today in the Middle East and surrounding areas.  That coloring is mostly common within Caucasoid groups, though their skin might vary from white to a tan color.  There have been found, however, Egyptian mummies with reddish-blond hair which is of a lighter hue than &#8220;reddish,&#8221; which is more a shade of medium brown.</p>
<p>In considering everything about the region in question, take note that the origin of Indo-Europeans was between the Caspian and Black seas, in the Caucuses Mountains area, not far from the Mediterranean or Iran/Persia, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, etc.  </p>
<p>Credible evidence indicates the area was flooded at one time rendering it uninhabitable, causing the Indo-European migration to occur, contrary to what some claimed to be a migratory trek for the purpose of military invasion.  Most of the migration occurred as expansionism seeking new farmlands.  </p>
<p>The speed and breadth of expansion was facilitated by the horse and the use of the wheel. Horses were domesticated in the Caspian/Black Sea area for quite a long time before the floods occurred. </p>
<p>Since DNA evidence has now verified many Egyptian mummies as having common DNA with various European groups, it is obvious Indo-Europeans migrated into Egypt, also and it is reasonable to believe they also could have inhabited some Middle East areas as well, which is believable since it&rsquo;s logical to assume their migratory trek could also have followed the lines of the Mediterranean.  They went as far southeast as India, as far north as Northern Europe and as far West as the Atlantic, and south into Mesopotamia and Persia, which were closer to their area of origin.</p>
<p>Let me depart a bit here to offer information that might seem to be on the fringe, but is not.  Most of it can be authenticated. </p>
<p>The very accurate medical/historical clairvoyant, Edgar Cayce, who described the Essenes before the Dead Sea scrolls were found and named them as the sect Jesus belonged to, and also correctly placed the age of the Great Pyramid at a different date than was originally thought, which proved to be correct also, described Jesus&rsquo;s hair as &#8220;red,&#8221; and his eyes as grey or, perhaps, blue.  Before dismissing this as new age balderdash, I would suggest anyone wanting to verify the accuracy of this man to investigate him thoroughly as I have done.</p>
<p>On the Essenes/Dad Sea Scrolls     https://tinyurl.com/d5nmm7c</p>
<p>First read the reading: </p>
<p>Cayce reading:</p>
<p>&#8220;4.The Master&rsquo;s hair is &#8216;most red, inclined to be curly in portions, yet not feminine or weak, STRONG, with heavy piercing eyes that are blue or steel-gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;5.His weight would be at least a hundred and seventy pounds. Long tapering fingers, nails well kept. Long nail, though, on the left little finger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Addendum to reading:</p>
<p>&#8220;Few people are aware, that there is in existence today, in the Archives in Rome, a description of Christ. It is contained in a report written nearly two thousand years ago, by a Roman, Publius Lentulus, to his Emperor, Tiberias. It reads:</p>
<p>&#8220;There has appeared in Palestine a man who is still living and whose power is extraordinary. He has the title given him of Great Prophet, his disciples call him &#8216;Son of God&rsquo;. He raises the dead and heals all sorts of diseases. &#8220;He is a tall, well proportioned man, and there is an air of severity in his countenance which at once attracts the love and reverence of those who see him. His hair is the colour of new wine from the roots to the ears, and thence to the shoulders it is curled and falls down to the lowest part of them. Upon the forehead, it parts in two after the manner of Nazarenes.</p>
<p>&#8220;His forehead is flat and fair, his face without blemish or defect, and adorned with a graceful expression. His nose and mouth are very well proportioned, his beard is thick and the colour of his hair. His eyes are grey and extremely lively.</p>
<p>&#8220;In his reproofs, he is terrible, but in his exhortations and instructions, amiable and courteous. There is something wonderfully charming in this face with a mixture of gravity. He is never seen to laugh, but has been observed to weep. He is very straight in stature, his hands large and spreading, his arms are very beautiful. &#8220;He talks little, but with a great quality and is the handsomest man in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/dyk5lsg" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/dyk5lsg</a></p>
<p>Note: After reading the above, do the investigation of Cayce regarding medical diagnosis and an ability to ACCURATELY diagnose ailments in complex medical terms with the patient thousands of miles away, although he was just a common man and not a doctor.  Read the information regarding the Essenes and the age of the Great Pyramid, plus other historical information he revealed which can be verified.</p>
<p>While many will doubt ANYTHING coming from a person with ESP, and many want to claim findings they feel don&rsquo;t fit their prejudices as hoaxes, I don&rsquo;t see how they can deny giving great weight to the consideration that the letter to Tiberias as being an accurate description of Jesus.</p>
<p>Do I believe it?  I&rsquo;m inclined to since the description in the letter and the clairvoyant, Edgar Cayce is about the same.  But I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind yet.  I&rsquo;m still investigating and will consider any info somebody else might have, and I might add that I&rsquo;m an agnostic right now.</p>

		<p>The archaeologist A.H. Sayce may shed some light on this issue. In his book Race in Ancient Egypt and the Old Testament, Sayce maintains that there were there were different racial strains among the Israelites.</p>
<p>The Assyrian relief carvings of Northern Tribe members, he says, depict what today we would regard as typical Jewish features. Nevertheless, Sayce also notes, Egyptian artists portrayed men of Judah captured by the Pharoah Shishak as European types of fair complexion. He identifies them as being &#8220;Amorite in race, though not in name&#8221; and says they were &#8220;the bulk of the population in southern Judah.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Ice, there are some things you need to understand, at least regarding fundamental anthropology:</p>
<p>1. Indo-Europeans &amp; Caucasian are NOT interchangeable with &ldquo;white Europeans&rdquo;. A group of people can be wholly Caucasian ( Europeans, Arabs, Jews, East Indians, Sri Lankans, Pakistanis, Iranians, North Africans, Turks, Central Asians) and YET not related to each other. They are still distinct ethno-racial groups which would be mere intellectual dishonesty to loop them all as one group, which you and some others seem to promulgate.</p>
<p>Thus Jesus Christ was a non white, because he was a Mizrahi Jew.</p>
<p>2. As an earlier poster stated, red-hair has nothing to do with being white. Having &ldquo;red hair&rdquo; does not automatically make you an Irish! Many people from the middle east &amp; south Asia have red hair.</p>
<p>3. Your inaccurate quote of the supposed white skin &amp; blue/ grey eyes of Yeshoua ha-Notzri ( Jesus) by using paltry evidence and worse quoting a C graded Psychic ( neither a Historian nor an Anthropologist/ Scientist or scholar of any sort) like Edgar Cayce. The man should have been dismissed as a mordacious crank. Here&rsquo;s more about the psychic you quoted. Please refrain from using such crack pots as your reference to make a point, it makes your argument look weak!</p>

		<p>Reply to #88. Thank you Ice for illucidating some of this. <br>
I would say, however that it is not only pluasible that Indo-Europeans were in the middle east, it is quite well established and uncontested, even without DNA evidence.</p>
<p>While it IS contested that there were Indo-Europeans among the Hyksos confederation (a semitic group that may also have contained Indo-European tribes) ruling the Nile Delta, it is uncontested that there were Indo-European peoples all over the Middle East. Such groups included but were not limited to the rulers of the Kingdom of Mitanni who were Aryans proper and spoke what you might call Sanskrit and worshipped the Veddic gods, the Hittites in Anatolia (Asia Minor) who had invaded from the Balkans and Thrace, other Indo-European groups throuhout Anatolia and including Thracian tribes (and in 279 B.C.the Galatians, the tribes of Tolistobogii, Trocmi, and Tectosages who were Celtic tribes who invaded Anatolia and settled the central plateau of Anatolia and who are famously mentioned in the Bible), the Cassi or Kassi who are sometimes called the Kassites or the Kasdim and who ruled part of Mesopotamia for a time, the Medes and Persians of Iran who went to Iran from the Eurasian Steppes and who created a large empire and were closely realted to Scythians and Sarmatians, and others.  </p>

<p>The above link is to a facial composite of the Apostle Paul. Based on the fact that both Jesus and Paul were born to the same Judaean/Israelite ethnic group, they very likely had a similar appearance. </p>
<p>Considering the most common traditional depiction of Jesus Christ is of a man with light skin, a long face, and wavy brown (somewhat reddish-brown) hair, that will always be what I consider his true likeness. Note that those features are ones that are fairly common across central Europe and the British Isles, and reflect neither the extremes of a round skull dark Arab or an extremely light Nordic.</p>
<p>I believe that the Mid-East phenotype, especially of Muslims, has been greatly altered because of interbreeding during the slave trade, which added both more Negroid and more Nordic/Slavic features (Europeans were frequently enslaved by Muslims). However, the ancient Semitic race was not less white than the ancient Greeks or Romans. </p>
<p>Was Jesus &#8220;European&#8221;? No, strictly speaking he was not. But was he of the same race as the Europeans? Yes, I would say so. </p>
<p>Note that I do not consider modern Jews to necessarily have the same precise phenotypes of the ancient Judaeans. </p>

<p>I am surprised, Sir, that a geneticist who does include and consult previous anthropological and archaeological work in his own work would apparently use the current English Vulgate and very imprecise and incorrect use of the term &#8220;white&#8221; as meaning only Northwestern Europeans or Northern Europeans or very pale people (or just indigenous Scandinavians?). </p>
<p>It is well accepted, for good reason, and established that the Indo-Europeans of ancient and later times were of the Caucasian Race and even that they were originally of a Nordic type but that they mixed with the indigenous populations in the areas in which they invaded (but who were mainly Caucasian themselves). It was thought many, many, many decades ago that the Hittites were of the Mongoloid Race but that theory was long ago discarded, even before the wonders of tracing the X and Y chromosomes. They almost certainly mixed with the Armenoid, Mediterranean, and Indo-European local races already in Anatolia.</p>
<p>As for proving my statements about geneticists, it would require an extensive statistical analysis, a Herculean task which I will not undertake to prove it to you. This is the impression that I have from having read many of the studies of population movements and genetics. </p>
<p>Again, without statistical analysis to prove it, I cannot prove my further observation that many of the social and related portions of harder sciences have been polluted by Marxist and other ideologies. </p>
<p>It is well established that there is a Marxist Archaeology, for example. There is even a book on the subject. It is called, Marxist Archaeology. </p>
<p>&#8220;Climategate&#8221; and the more recent &#8220;Climategate II&#8221; and many scientists have evidenced, for example, that there is a great deal of leverage applied to the sciences nowadays to get desired political results. </p>
<p>Is it such a stretch to believe that some scientists are motivated by fanaticism or profit and politics like the Anthropogenic Global Warming crowd? Is it far-fetched to believe that there are some geneticists who are quite devoted if not fanatical Zionists who wish to prove a genetic &#8220;claim&#8221; on the &#8220;ancestral homeland?&#8221; Is it impossible that there are some who are honest but quite prejudiced by their ideologies and beliefs? </p>
<p>I never said that there were no exceptions whatsoever. I will take your word for it that you are one of them. I never named names but there is a preponderance of names like Cohen among the scientists showing a large genetic heritage among Jews that is directly traceable to what is now called Israel. It seems like a conflict of interest and that one would recuse oneself from an investigation like that. You obviously are an exception and consider the immense contribution and heritage from the host peoples of the Diaspora. Of course, it is well-known that there were many conversions up until about the year 1,000 A.D. but not many afterword.</p>
<p>Those issues were only an interesting but important aside to me. </p>
<p>I am mainly espousing the points here that the ancient Fertile Crescent and its peoples were of various types of Caucasoid peoples and that there were many local races of the Caucasoid Race mixing together in the ancient Middle East but that it is ridiculous to claim that Jesus was black! </p>
<p>I am also making the point that political correctness and Marxist and Zionist ideologies have no place in such investigations. </p>
<p>Also, the term &#8220;white&#8221; as a description only of pale people but used as a racial descriptor is very imprecise and incorrect and that is another point that I am trying to make here. From a physical anthropology and human variation standpoint, the term white should only be applied to the entire Caucasian Race, even the multitude of brown-skinned Caucasians. The Mediterranean Local Race is a branch of the Caucasian Race, for example. They are white even if brown.</p>

<p>Pretty handy! All you have to do is explain that you are a geneticist. We are not allowed to question the priestly caste.</p>
<p>What kind of work does your reputable Northeastern lab. do? Are you specialists in ivestigations of ancient population movements, ancient migrations?</p>
<p>It seem absolutely untenable to me that a scientist would espouse the current Vulgate use of the term &#8220;white&#8221; in such a way as to claim that Persians, Afghans, and Indians are not &#8220;white,&#8221; Caucasian. It stretches credulity to think that one who uses terms in such a way has ever studied traditional Human Variation as a branch of Physical Anthropology. </p>

<p>I have never seen the theory before that the ancient Hebrews or Isrealites were 100% descended from the Hittites. A very interesting and romantic theory! The Hitttites were a very interesting and powerful people. It is well accepted that the Hittites contributed.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Was Jesus &ldquo;European&rdquo;? No, strictly speaking he was not. But was he of the same race as the Europeans? Yes, I would say so.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Oh so when I get back to Afghanistan, I guess using your logic, I should call all the &#8220;Hadjis&#8221; as European. Why not? After all they are all Caucasian too. And in some cases even have red hair! Who would have thought? Jesus was definitely Caucasian. Jesus was definitely not white and neither was he of the same race as Europeans. No different from Abdul the Pakistani cab driver or Sureesh the Indian poster on Amren just because they maybe Caucasians like us Euro Americans! </p>
<p>Note that I do not consider modern Jews to necessarily have the same precise phenotypes of the ancient Judaeans. <br>

<p>Who cares about the red hair? You have to admit that most redheads are Caucasians and are very white, too! The red hair is a red herring though. Yeah there are some Mongols with red hair and some tan skinned Caucasians with red hair but it is usually because they have some descent, even if only partial, from Caucasians and sometimes Nordics in particular. </p>
<p>But as I said, the red hair is a red herring. I can&rsquo;t speak for the others but my arguments do not rest on the red hair!</p>

&#8220;Reply to #88. Thank you Ice for illucidating some of this. <br>
I would say, however that it is not only pluasible that Indo-Europeans were in the middle east, it is quite well established and uncontested, even without DNA evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, thank you for the information.  I&rsquo;ve been reading of other verification, since the above post, that tracks IE, and it appears as if they have been tracked by agricultural implements and tools used only by IE&rsquo;s and also by language, as well as other bits of evidence.

		<p>Reply to Aaron from Rhode Island: I guess that you are not older than 30. I base that unscientific guess on your tenacious use of the term &#8220;white&#8221; as a racial descriptor that excludes most of the Caucasian Race. This incorrect usage has grown from all sides of the race issues during the age of political correctness (cultural Marxism) in which it is not politically correct to study or even understand the discipline of Human Variation as a branch of Physical Anthropology. The term is based on using the red herring of skin color (and the consequent marginalization of the people of Northern Europe and their descendants) by cultural Marxists and other hostile groups. </p>

<p>Obviously I had to denote the term &#8220;white&#8221; to specify Europeans ONLY! I cannot make profound anthropological arguments on a forum where not everyone would comprehend the complexity of races. However, what baffles me even more is your incredulous claim that ALL Caucasians should be classified as &#8220;white&#8221; ? On what basis can you assert your claims? Show me ONE text book or ANY established nomenclature that would imply your ridiculous assertion! Caucasians are a race, white Europeans are part of this family and so are brown complexioned people from the middle east &amp; India. However, to loop Indians, Arabs, Jews along with white skinned Europeans as ONE single entity using the nomenclature: white ( simply because they all happen to fall under the Caucasian family) is preposterous!</p>
<p>Mizrahi Jews are the same Jewish ethnicity which include King David, all the prophets down to Malachi and then Jesus. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Some of their ruling elite were described as red haired, blue or green eyed, white skinned and were probably descended from ancient Indo-European peoples. The bulk of the Kirgiz were, however, Turco-Mongol.&#8221; Scholar David Nicole in his book, Atilla and the Nomad Hordes (1990 Osprey Publishing, Ltd., p. 50).</p>
<p>I use this quote to show some of the more stalwart promoters of inflexibility that these features are sometimes an indication of some intermarrriage and that it is commonly taken to indicate mixed ancestry with Indo-Europeans and Nordics. It also shows that the Caucasians, and indeed the Indo-Europeans, were spread all the way through Mongolia at one point. In this case, Nicole is speaking of the mostly Mongoloid Kirgiz when they were still in their seperate Baraba Steppe, surrounded by the Siberian Taiga. </p>
<p>I have a personal hypothesis, never substantiated, that red hair occurs often in populations in which a blond group mixed with a dark haired group. I have noted from observation that this is common in such groups. Note the Irish, the Scots, and others.</p>
<p>There has been intermarriage, the Indo-European Nordics were wide spread across Europe and Asia, and fair hair and other usually Nordic features can reasonably be taken to indicate admixture.</p>

&#8220;1. Indo-Europeans &amp; Caucasian are NOT interchangeable with &ldquo;white Europeans&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In ancient times there were indeed other peoples which have been classified as having non-white skin coloring, but all had enough similar characteristics to be classified under the racial description as Caucasoids.  </p>
<p>The evidence I wrote about has to do with white IE&rsquo;s, and it was these people who either pushed out, lived with, or interbred with the existing populations.</p>
<p>The reddish hair you refer to is the carrot color.  I think you misread my description of &#8220;reddish hair. </p>
<p>&#8220;Thus Jesus Christ was a non white, because he was a Mizrahi Jew.&#8221;</p>
<p>It has never been established that Jesus was truly Mizrahi nor has it been established that Mizahi Jews did not interbreed at some point with white I.E.&rsquo;s, who were throughout the entire area for quite a long time, so your generalized assertions can&rsquo;t possibly be taken as fact.  Better do a bit more research.</p>
<p>Too, for some reason you seem to blindly want to believe that the evidence within the quote I offered of Jesus depicts him as having white skin.  It did not.  Better read it again.  You seem to be burdened with some kind of anti-white angst.</p>
<p>But, after having asserted that, let me say that Jesus could well have been white.  You certainly don&rsquo;t know for certain one way or another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having &ldquo;red hair&rdquo; does not automatically make you an (sic) <br>
Irish! Many people from the middle east &amp; south Asia have red hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought that&rsquo;s what I wrote, except I don&rsquo;t agree that &#8220;many people&#8221; from South Asia have reddish brown hair and the people of the Middle East who do have that coloring usually have a lot of white European blood.  A good example are Lebanese.  Many of them have white skin, and if we look a bit further east we&rsquo;ll note that there are many in Afghanistan and Iran who do also, as well as many others throughout the entire area.  Much interbreeding has occurred from the first IE migrations up through the Crusades and into modern times.</p>
<p>As regards your references denigrating Edgar Cayce, it&rsquo;s all nonsense.  I&rsquo;ve read that junk before.  It is as a drop in the ocean compared to the millions who have studied the man and know him to be an honest person in search of the truth.</p>

<p>Aaron, I have explained my position perfectly and thoroughly! As for books, there are innumerable books that explain that the term &#8220;White&#8221; when applied to race is commonly used as a name for the &#8220;white&#8221; or Caucasian Race.  This is common knowledge to well-read people over the age of 30 or 40. Your rigid adherence to the claim that brown people belong to a different, brown, race is absurd and no anthropologist has made such an assertion.  </p>
<p>When I feel like accepting your orders to perform tedious chores who&rsquo;s outcome is a sure vindication of my assertions, I will do so. It is easy to find such books, especially among older volumes from before the political correctness movement started by Soviet Communists took over our country. You can start with the article &#8220;Races of Man&#8221; in the 1967 Worldbook Encyclopedia (from before you were born, I&rsquo;d guess). It was common knowledge. </p>
<p>The argument over the nomenclature &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;brown&#8221; is not that important (and I think that you know this but you wish to impose your unscientific nomenclature unworthy of a geneticist upon the rest of us no matter what!) except to dispel the immense salient ignorance on the subject. </p>
<p>Suffice it to say that there is a Caucasian Race and it includes most of the people of Europe and their descendents, Arabs, Jews (even the Khazar descendents are primarily Caucasian, Caucasoid), Persians, most Afghans (although the Hazara are Persian-speaking Mongols), most of the people of India and Pakistan (although some of the people of the region are Australoids), and others. The Caucasoid Race includes people who range from very white to almost black in color. The Caucasoid Race also includes truculent Mizrahi. Brown as they might be (or perhaps grayish when they are deprived of a descent amount of sunlight in a cloudy, short-day, low altitude, cloudy and northern place like Rhode Island). I shudder when I think of what that sun-deprived place does to the brown skin (or is it gray now?) and the mood and intellect (deprivation of full-spectrum light can result in a massive serotonin deficit) of a normally healthy and intelligent brown person.  Not to mention the vitamin D deficit!</p>
<p>Speaking of serotonin and intellect,  it is well-known that many IQ test investigations have shown Jews at the very top, above the Chinese! The results show that the Ashkenazim score much higher than other Jewish groups. Very interesting. Are those Ashkenazim white or brown? That is the terribly important question, worthy of a knock-down-drag-out fight. Well, I told you that I do not wish to engage in tedious chores whos outcome is assured.</p>

		<p>P.S. Also, Aaron, I do not lump them together completely, they are different branches of the Caucasian Race. I&rsquo;ll accept that the Mizrahi are in my major Race but I do not have very much of that specific local race in my ancestry, maybe a little for some reason. If you look at the cover of the Time Life book, The Celts, I look almost exactly like most of those guys except with blue eyes and less of a tan. But even guys like that are somewhat related to the Mizrahi. Perhaps you think that you are superior to such men but I assure you that you are not.</p>

		<p>Reply to #98. You make a very good point. </p>
<p>I suspect that most Americans are rather neutral on the subject of the ancestry of Jews or Zionism, but I suspect, based only on experience and reading, that most American Jews are Zionists. </p>
<p>However, there are many American Jews who cricize many aspects of curent Israeli policy, thank God. I suspect that most American Jews steadfastly support Israel&rsquo;s &#8220;right to exist&#8221; and feel that it is good that it was founded in 1948. I could be wrong. </p>
<p>I suppose that many ardent Anti-Zionists should also recuse themselves from such research. I would not do such research because I am biased. I am interested in the subject, however, because Jews have such an apparently mixed and a much more interesting history than the official versions of it. </p>
<p>Although it is irrational, many believe that if most Jews have a lot of Middle Eastern ancestry, they are entitled to that land after 2,000 years, not me. </p>
<p>There was a recent snafoo in a major journal that retroactively tried to censor the work of a notoriously biased non-Jewish geneticist so you can rest assured that this is a contested issue and there are people who should recuse themselves on both sides. </p>
<p>Also, the &#8220;chosen people&#8221; dogma is quite dear to the heart of many Jewish people, right up there with the cherished and much nurtured and enjoyed history of persecution that is constantly nursed to greatest effect and thoroughly enjoyed by some. It would sure be funny if it turned out that the ancient Hebrews were really &#8220;chosen&#8221; by an extraterrestrial malefactor who was overbearing, murderous, and jealous and who had some strange motivations.</p>
<p>As for milking the millenial worldwide persecution one can easily imagine converstions in the family. </p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was terrible when the Weismans were in Pharoah&rsquo;s land making mud bricks to build the pyramids.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, the suffering that they endured when the Shapiros were in Babylon!&#8221; &#8220;Oh, it was so horrible when the Cohens were forced to exercize by the Seleucid Hellenistic kings! They fought a bloody war against the gymansium physical culture!&#8221; Oh the humanity. Nude discuss throwing!<br>
&#8220;The Czar made all of us Wolfowitzes go to the front of the army as cannon fodder.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, it was so horrible when the Goldbergs were wandering in the desert for 40 years. And those Mandlebaums were worshipping the golden calf!&#8221; It seems to be savored by some people. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care if he was purple with yellow stripes.  Jesus didn&rsquo;t develop Christianity - Christians did.  And Christianity (the religion, its morals and values) is and always was (until the Second Vatican) a WHITE religion imparted to brown, black and yellow peoples to civilize them.  If there WAS a Jesus (a topic on which I keep an open mind) it makes sense that an All-Powerful-Being would send His son in the disguise of the people he was trying to influence.  Which is to say that if Jesus had been born in the Roman province of Germania,  I presume he would have had blue eye and blonde hair. Born in Africa?  He would have looked like an emaciated silverback gorilla &hellip; etc.</p>

		<p>The reverse-photo image on the Turin shroud is compatible with both west European medieval artistic images of Jesus and also his possible real-life appearance in first-century Galilee. The shroud bears frontal and dorsal full-length body images with a gap at the scalp. It is NOT a &#8220;wrapping&#8221; - instead think of 2D brass-rubbings back and front.  If the image were created miraculously subsequent to &#8220;the resurrection&#8221; we could be reasonably sure it portrays the crucified Jesus, but this is a big if.  There is experimental evidence that medieval technology was just about capable of producing the underlying image. <br>
The blood-group of &#8220;stains&#8221; reportedly found on the material is another controversial matter on which relevant data is (as yet)unfortunately insufficient.<br>

<p>&#8220;Absolute balderdash! No they have NOT! Please show me clear evidence to support your claim! I&rsquo;m a geneticist in a reputed lab in the North east, I know what I&rsquo;m talking about, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Your petty infantile post is all the more evidence of the sheer futility in expressing your views in a coherent &amp; logical manner.&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t cost you anything to say that, does it? <br>
 <br>
That is exactly how you have proven yourself to be and you have been completely illogical in your arguments. I have wondered if I have been debating with a child when dealing with you. I am motivated by my exasperation with the ignorance and cultural Marxism (political correctness, a movement and dogma developed by Soviet Communists) that is so common when dealing with this subject. That is why I was interested in this article. Your ignorance is beyond the pale. Besides that, you are a real pain in the tuchus! </p>
<p>Really, nothing that we have been debating has to do with whether Jesus was really black or not. I was slightly interested in that because I&rsquo;m tired of the thorn in the side black supremacists (from what I have seen, most blacks hate Jews, in spite of the fact that Jews have overwhelming supported blacks in their conflicts with Anglo-Americans and other whites, by the way) and their grasping at straws for greatness. </p>
<p>An important point is that you have not answered many of my questions as you apparently wish to claim expertise where you obviously have none and you will not discuss what kind of work your reputable lab. does. I&rsquo;m glad that you work for a reputable lab. I am so tired of people from disreputable labs posting here. </p>
<p>I asked you if you did population genetics and studies of migrations at your lab. (I would add human variation to the requirements as it is pertinent to the discussion). </p>
<p>With regard to your implied claim (I say implied because you are sneaky and I need to watch my language so you don&rsquo;t wiggle out dishonestly) that there are no books that say that the Caucasian Race is called the White Race, virtually every book and encyclopedia ever published before 1980 and some afterword that are physical anthropology or human variation books says that. </p>
<p>That was before you wonders of the two path trek, chasers of a Y and an X chromosome, claimed the priesthood. </p>
<p>I do not have any of those books in the house now. I lost my previous library in a fire caused by the owners of the building in which I lived several years ago. By the time I borrow some from the academic libraries, this page will be in the archives. </p>
<p>Look it up yourself, young man. They all say that! All of the books that were written before the Cultural Marxists attacked all of the previous work on political correctness grounds. I am sick and tired of pseudo-scientists and pseudo-intellectuals ignoring all of the past work and following the path of political correctness and ignorance.</p>
<p>Your opening argument is an appeal to expertism, the refuge of the scoundrel, an expertise that you yourself have disproven. I have thoroughly trounced you in this debate, and you know it. Your dishonestly and lack of honor precludes you from admitting it.</p>
<p>If you do not want to consider yourself part of the White Race, good riddance, you are a thorn in the side of the other whites.</p>
<p>Jews ARE white and many Jews will take great offense at your characterization of them as non-white. By your thinking, Italians are non-white. I dare you to go into an old Italian neighborhood on the Eastern Seaboard and tell the people there that they are not white. I would really enjoy seeing that!</p>
<p>Many people of India will be offended if you try to tell them that they are not part of the white race. They might be tempted to tell you pudi pandi mud ban chut, teri maket ban chut!</p>
<p>In short, you are defeated and you know it. I will leave you with a quote by Shakespeare: </p>
<p>&#8220;All thy tediousness on me?&#8221; -MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING<br>

		<p>COULD IT BE that the myth-making surrounding Edgar Cayce is identical in process to that which surrounded the historical Jesus?</p>
<p>I think it is entirely possible that both had some sort of healing powers, whether due to &#8220;personal magnetism&#8221; or some other source.</p>
<p>When we open that door, though, just a crack, we have to be very careful. I don&rsquo;t think the walking-on-water thing actually happened  &mdash;  how did he keep his balance on such rough waters? The dude could have been a champion snowboarder! Things like this are, in my opinion, parables that got confused with history, much like the tearing-of-the-holy-of-holies-curtain thing.     </p>

&#8220;Actually, what is there to know about this crack pot? He was a psychic and a fraudster who believed in nonsense like Atlantis.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more to know about him, specifically that his medical diagnosis of patients thousands of miles away were 100% accurate, verified many times by attending physicians.  Cayce was poor all his life though he could have made millions if it were his intent to earn money for his efforts.  He was a humanitarian who loved people and wanted to help them any way he could.  He died early, because of the overwork the readings placed on his system.  He also was without much money or assets to his name at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Regarding Atlantis or any other topic of his readings, he never knew what he had said during his hypnotic trances.  He was a staunch Christian who, in his waking state, rejected anything that was in contrast or opposition to biblical teaching.  Personally, I keep an open mind on his readings on Atlantis.</p>
<p>The only people who have ever criticized him were those who had some ulterior motive for doing so or political reasons, but they were very, very few. </p>
<p>&#8220;A mere mythmaking con man. To even include this guy as your best bet to talk about something related to my race ( Jewish identity) and concerning my professional field ( genetics/ Anthropology) is ridiculous!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jewish,&#8221; is not a race.  Jews are part of the Caucasoid race.  &#8220;Jewish&#8221; is an ethnicity.  And, are we to believe because you are Jewish you are the final authority on all things Jewish?  Rather silly, don&rsquo;t you think?  Childish too.</p>
<p>I notice that you never addressed the description of Jesus given in a letter by Publius Lentullus to Tiberias.  Why not?  What reason would this man have of fabricating someone&rsquo;s appearance when Rome was known to send underlings to the colliseum as food for the big cats for lesser offences than lying.</p>
<p>Here is another reference to it, along with other info:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9l725j" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/y9l725j</a> <br>
Letter of Publius Lentullus to Caesar<br>
Tiberias</p>
<p>If I have time this evening, I&rsquo;m going to scour my reading material and the internet to locate other accurate claims by Cayce regarding biblical times, besides his correct identification of Jesus being an Essene, long before it was known, and also his correct identification of the age of the Great Pyramid.  There were others I could have cited, but they didn&rsquo;t readly come to mind.  I&rsquo;ll find them and submit another post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, you seriously cannot compare a mediocre Psychic with bad reputation with established &amp; reputed Anthropologists, Scientists and Historians who have very well established that Jesus was a non white semite!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cayce&rsquo;s reputation was not only revered during his time, it carries on today by millions worldwide.  An entire research center Virginia Beach, Virginia has been constructed to research his readings:  The Association of Research and Enlightenment. </p>
<p>Keeping a closed mind and rejecting all possibilities is the work of those who are closed-minded and bigoted. </p>
<p>&#8220;I have no problem with the truth, do you? The truth can be a bitter pill to swallow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, the truth is a hard pill to swallow to those too bigoted to accept it.  I am not.  My mind is open.  Yours is closed to all accept what you have been programmed to believe.  And, the repeated rejection, on no factual basis whatsoever, of information that could well prove to be true tells me it is EXACTLY the truth you fear most of all.</p>

		<p>Jesus of Nazareth, the historical Jesus, no doubt looked like the people around him, which is to say, he looked like a Middle Eastern (Sephardic) Jew or a Palestinian of today. Or so we think. But there were men from other parts of the world in Palestine in that day. One them could have been part of his ancestry.</p>
<p>Jesus the Messiah and Savior is represented in variety of ways by different churches in different parts of the world. The long-faced Nordic Jesus is Europe&rsquo;s representation of him. In Africa, he is black. In Latin America, he is represented as a Latin American type. Nothing wrong with this as far as I am concerned since we, in fact, do not know what he looked like.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Three Kings&#8221; who visited the infant Jesus probably were historical also. We do not know exactly what they were, but they probably were men of South Asian nationality. In America, they have come to be represented sometimes as one black African, one Nordic and one Middle Easterner. Nothing wrong with that either, since we do not know who they were, or if they were kings, wise men or just three guys from out of town who became spiritually engrossed.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind, there was an actual man, Jesus of Nazareth. That is fact, not conjecture.</p>

		<p>  Posts have strayed from from one questioner asking about the race of the mother of Jesus. Without delving into the different genealogies in Luke and Matthew, I would like to throw the following cat among your squabbling pigeons to watch their reactions:<br>
  &#8220;Die historische Personlichkeit Jesu (Munich, 1924)&hellip;reports that, according to the Syrian preacher Ephraem (fourth century AD), Jesus had&hellip;someone born in Dan for a mother and a Latin as father&hellip;adding &#8216;Jesus thus derived his ancestry from two of the greatest and most famous nations - namely from the Syrians on the maternal side and the Romans on the paternal&rsquo;. Ephraem presupposes the universal acknowledgment of this fact.&#8221;<br>
