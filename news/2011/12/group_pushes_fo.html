<h1>Group Pushes for Asian-American Studies Program</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Berkman, Daily Targum, December 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Protestors chanting &#8220;We are Asian-Americans, we will not stop the fight,&#8221; last week on the College Avenue campus were heard in School of Arts and Sciences Executive Dean Douglas Greenberg&rsquo;s office, but were not greeted with a desirable response.</p>
<p>The march on December 7 to Greenberg&rsquo;s office on 77 Hamilton St. was part of the Asian American Leadership Cabinet&rsquo;s ongoing initiative for an Asian-American studies program at the University.</p>
<p>Greenberg said he recognizes the protestors&rsquo; concerns, but can only do so much under financial pressures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we do enough in Asian-American studies? Probably not. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a fair claim to say we&rsquo;re unfair,&#8221; Greenberg said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re doing the best we can with very limited resources. Students surely know what the situation with the Rutgers budget is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 60 marchers wanted to express Asian-American studies&rsquo; importance on campus, said Long Pham, an AALC member.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have Asian Studies, but that relates to Asia. We want to know the Asian-American history, the way to analyze the things that have happened to us in the past and how they affect us politically, socially, culturally and economically,&#8221; said Pham, a School of Arts and Sciences senior.</p>
<p>After failed attempts at quiet negotiation, students staged a loud protest to get attention, said Aamir Lalani, co-coordinator of the demonstration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going against the prevailing notion that Asians are passive and not willing to take a stand,&#8221; said Lalani, a School of Arts and Sciences sophomore. &#8220;That&rsquo;s in part what I believe has the University resting and not fully supporting Asian-American studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The organization plans for more protests toward equal academic opportunities, said Claire Chang, an AALC member.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe, as a collective, that we can do things efficiently without leaving people out of the process,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We all have this collective effort to get things done.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Look at this phrase: &#8220;&hellip;we want to know&hellip;the things&hellip;that have happened to us in the past&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the real crux of the problem here.  Every reader of Amren needs to understand the false issue raised.</p>
<p>All these Asians (and Latinos, etc) have come over here in the last 30 years or so, almost none of them have been born here, and almost none of those who were born here are from people with roots that go back more than that initial 30 years or so.</p>
<p>By framing the issues as &#8220;what happened to us&#8221; they are trying to make a false connection to Asians and Latinos who happened to live or work here 150 years ago or more.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to make it seem that they are DIRECT descendants of any Chinese laborers in California or mestizo cowboys in Texas.  All those early Asians and &#8216;latinos&rsquo; assimilated long, long ago, and their descendants have no connection at all with the lands of origin.  Only scattered last names remain.</p>
<p>But every Lee Chin Fu and Pablo Escoboza who entered this land in the last 30 years is trying to make a historical claim to being here.  But these newcomers have NO HISTORY here.  Some other people who came long ago have such a claim, but they have forgotten all links in the passage of time.</p>
<p>We must be careful to remind recent immigrants and their first generation chldren that they are newcomers, and the travails of the Chinese laborers who built the railroad have no connection with them.  All the Latinos also need to be reminded, that your family from the Dominican Republic or central Mexico likewise has no share in a &#8216;Latino-american history&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Why not?  Worked first for blacks, then Hispanics:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;I teach at a university where we have separate graduation ceremonies predicated on race &hellip; and we also have a group: La Raza. La Raza means &lsquo;The Race.&rsquo;  It&rsquo;s 2004.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem in a national dialogue you permit some group to call themselves &lsquo;Das Volk.&rsquo; This &hellip; is a racialist type awareness or self-identification. If you look at the MEChA [Chicano Student Movement of Aztl√°n] slogan, &lsquo;A bronze state for a bronze race,&rsquo; or everything for La Raza &hellip; this has to be questioned &hellip;&rdquo; (Excerpt from &ldquo;In-Depth: Victor Davis Hanson,&rdquo; a C-SPAN interview with the classicist, military historian, central California farmer and author of Mexifornia: A State of Becoming, Mar. 7, 2004) </p>

<p>Anyone who wants to know history can look it up if they are interested, I do it all the time.  What Pham and his group want is coddling, attention, and most importantly, the power that comes from lording their ethnic/racial history over others in order to gain special privileges.  If they were as intelligent as we are constantly told they are, they would know that this is an old game. Rutgers will be fools if they give in. Perhaps they could offer an online class that contains links to extant stories on Asian/American history, as if PBS doesn&rsquo;t run them enough.</p>

<p>A lot of those &#8220;Pablo Escoboza&#8221; types saying that are from south of Guadalajara, or were when they decided to &#8220;migrate&#8221; northward.  They like to say we stole their land, when they nor generations of their ancestry going back quite a ways never laid eyes on northern Mexico much less the American Southwest.</p>

		<p>I wonder if these kids have ever heard of something called a library.  That&rsquo;s how I got my German-American history, and they can get their Asian-American history.  You don&rsquo;t have to get  credit for something you are studying for personal interest.</p>

		<p>ref. 2 and 3<br>
The late Enoch Powell conceived of a trajectory of power over time that had been centered in London, was at his time (late<br>
60&#8221;s) centered in Washington, D.C., and would evolve to be<br>
centered in Beijing.  It is not impossible  that our realistic<br>
survival might be facilitated by a loyalty to this trajectory and by a suitable complementary relationship with the Chinese.<br>
They &#8220;stand taller&#8221; academically and in other respects on this<br>
campus (Texas location) than most of our &#8220;majority&#8221; students.  Let&rsquo;s not exacerbate our troubles by getting into a struggle against Mr. Reality.     </p>

		<p>Look at the picture.  The stylized fist says it all.  This is just another group that thinks if they throw their support behind communism that they will be rewarded when the white man&rsquo;s possessions are divided up after a genocidal war.</p>
<p>They really should consider carefully who they are threatening (and they ARE threatening).  A genocidal war brought against us will end in genocide&hellip;..for the loser.  Since all these non-white groups threatening us, especially blacks are almost completely dependent on us, often for their next meal, the result of any sort of open conflict is pretty much a given.</p>

Why don&rsquo;t they just ask some of there parents to pull some of the cash out of Kimchi jar and endow a program somewhere.  Colleges never say no to an endowment. </p>

When are we going to stop giving this government our heart earned money so they can give it to groups like these?  We need to stop sending in our income tax. Raise the sales tax. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind paying $8 for a pack of gum knowing that everyone else would too.  Then it would be fair.

		<p>The whole debate that Asians are &#8220;smarter&#8221; then whites is completely false.</p>
<p>The IQ scores that are examined in Asian Countries are those of the brightest in the Cities. If all scores were tabulated in say China, Japan or India I&rsquo;m sure the Iq scores from the billions tested would not be so rosy. An IQ of 102 average, might drop to 90, along with the &#8220;haha shtoopid white man&#8221; attitude.</p>
<p>Lets be really clear about who Asians are trying to emulate with their modernization process. I am sick, absolutely sick to death of Western apologists falling over themselves to complement every race but their own. The edge Asia has over the West right now, is its homogeneity&hellip;.period. Diversity is not a strength, but a cancer for society. When Germany was comprised of Germans was it weak? How about Britain? Yet people fall over themselves congratulating the Japanese for their superior intelligence. Their not superior dammit, they were just left in peace to thrive. Asian stole or copied from the West in order to attain its progress. And they would not have been able to do so if they were carpet bombed by diversity like the West. </p>

		<p>Why is it that whenever there is a &#8220;heartwarming&#8221; story about someone who desperately needed an organ donation, and someone who selflessly came forward to help a total stranger: the recipient is always black and the donor is always white?  I knew it as soon as I read the headline, but the video confirms it.  What is a 23-year old girl thinking giving an organ to, and compromising her own health on behalf of, a total stranger?  Charity has to have a sense of proportion, otherwise it becomes perverse.</p>

		<p>Does it ever end? The immigrants of old were only too happy to learn what it means to be an American. The learned, without the help of anyone, what this once-proud country offered and then wholeheartedly embraced the concept. They were grateful for the chance to belong and to contribute. The brawling hoards who arrive today are a far cry from the immigrants of old, and don&rsquo;t even deserve to be here. I&rsquo;m all for a long moratorium on all immigration. </p>

		<p>Sorry, my Asian friends.  The blacks and hispanics sucked all the money out of us, plus our white guilt isn&rsquo;t as strong as it was, say, ten years ago.  Unless you&rsquo;re willing to point out the wrongs other races have done to you, that Asians have done throughout history, and that Asians have done to our people (British/American prisoners in WWII, Genghis Khan invading what is now Russia, etc), we will not pay for it or wish to hear what you have to say.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s ironic how the march for Asian-American Studies took place on December 7th, which is Pearl Harbor Day. </p>
<p>Dean Greenberg&rsquo;s Staff should have told the demonstrators that his office was closed due to the Pearl Harbor Day Rememberence Ceremonies. </p>
<p>We should remind the Asians of their sneak attacks, such as Pearl Harbor, and on the British Fleet at Singapore, as well as the Bataan Death March, and other Asian atrocities committed against White American Servicemen, and Missionaries, that were unfortunate enough to be captured by them.</p>

		<p>Whenever I see someone call Indians &#8220;Asians&#8221;, I can&rsquo;t help laughing. If you are for your &#8220;Europa for Europeans; Africa for Africans, etc&#8221; cause, the first and for most your must do is to get your facts and terminologies straight:  </p>
<p>Both the UK and the US calling East Indians &#8220;Asians&#8221; is a HUGE misnomer.  </p>
<p>Again : Indians ARE NOT Asians! - which word you don&rsquo;t understand?  </p>
<p>Indians ARE NOT Asians either biologically or geographically.</p>
<p>Indians have average IQ of 81, similar to their racial kins - Negritos and Australian Aborigines.  Even by looks, has anyone confuse an East Indian with an Asian(aka Orientals), ever? not even once?</p>
<p>Geographically, India is not even in the Eurasian Plate for God&rsquo;s sake, since it sits on Sub-continental Plate which was a part of Africa and has been flaoting towards Eurasian plate forming the highest mountain range on the planet - Hamalaya mountains when the two meet. </p>
<p>If East Indians were Asians in whatever sense, then you&rsquo;d have to admit in the same breath that Ethiopians, Morrocans and Somalis must be Europeans, sorry!   &mdash;   it makes perfect sense then for the pro-mass immigration liberal elites who really think that &#8220;Indians are Asians and Somalis are Europeans by origin or vice versus - hey we are all the race, aren&rsquo;t we&#8221;? </p>
<p>If you insist to call Indians Asians, then you have to ask yourself which side are you on?!</p>
<p>On the OP story, those demonstrators are a tiny amount of Asians, including fake ones such as Indians amongst them ( see the front row of the photo).  The demostration itself is nothing more than &#8220;Against AA&#8221;, IMO - isn&rsquo;t that what the Whites are asking for as well?</p>

		<p>Black studies, women&rsquo;s studies, Hispanic studies, gay studies, and Asian studies courses and majors invariably exaggerate the contributions of the group that is being studied. They engender in members of that group a feeling of collective grievance. <br>
 <br>
The theme of these courses is, &#8220;Our contributions have been under valued. We are oppressed.&#8221; These courses do not prepare one to earn a living. They promote attitudes that will make it difficult to get along with co-workers and supervisors. </p>

		<p>Another nail in the coffin for the common delusion that Asians are America&rsquo;s &#8220;model minority.&#8221;  These demonstrators are identity politicians, albeit budding ones.  And their goal is to secure unearned advantages for themselves.  Their high IQs relative to blacks aren&rsquo;t something to be welcomed.  It&rsquo;s intelligence misplaced.  </p>

		<p>Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, one of the things I&rsquo;ve always liked about Asian-Americans is that they&rsquo;re smart, quiet, industrious, and not annoying trouble-makers.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;re not on the verge of becoming just another noisy, demanding minority. Heaven knows we&rsquo;ve got enough of those already.</p>

		<p>It is simple to think that these Asians want an Asian-American Studies Program because Blacks and Hispanics have them, but I think it comes down money. An Asian-American Studies Program will provide jobs to less capable Asians, and a degree that is easy to complete. These Asians are not going to be passive about getting onto the diversity gravy train. </p>

		<p>#26. You are right that it is a misnomer in every case. The argument could be made that it refers to anyone from that continent in which case it is useless. I propose using the now discarded nomenclature (due to political correctness, social marxism). I like Carlton C. Coon&rsquo;s nomenclature: Mongoloid, Caucasoid, Congoid (of the Congo, blacks), Capoid (Of the Cape: San People or Bushmen and Hottentots, a unique race), Australoid (Australian Aborigines, Ainu, etc.), and I think that Amerind is a good name for American Indians because it is specific and the American Indians now appear to be, in light of new findings, Australoid, Mongoloid, and Caucasoid (from Paleolithic Europeans). Pakistanis should be called Pakistanis, Indians from India, Indians or Hindus. Specific nationalities could be called by their names, Chinese, Japanese, etc. Some of what we are currently calling &#8220;Asians&#8221; are quite different from each other even when we are talking about Asians of Mongoloid descent. For example, Hmong people are culturally and physically quite a bit different from Chinese People.</p>

		<p>The model minority asians who some people here have a warm spot in their hearts for are the off-spring of chinese and hindu-sihk engineeers who came over throughout the seventies to steal jobs from Native Born White American Men who worked as  Engineers and who had families to support..the vast majority of these men were veterans. Some of the comments here are really disgusting. Model minority asians were never intercangeable with Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>The Chinese Exclusion Act was a wonderfull piece of 19th century legislation that protected the racial interests of millions of Native Born White Americans..bring back the Chinese Exclusion Act&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;Black studies, women&rsquo;s studies, Hispanic studies, gay studies, and Asian studies courses and majors invariably exaggerate the contributions of the group that is being studied. They engender in members of that group a feeling of collective grievance.</p>
<p>The theme of these courses is, &ldquo;Our contributions have been under valued. We are oppressed.&rdquo; These courses do not prepare one to earn a living. They promote attitudes that will make it difficult to get along with co-workers and supervisors. &#8220;</p>
<p>This is a very important aspect of the situation that needed pointing out in this discussion.  Thank you for this post.  The time and money that is being wasted on actually creating division at colleges while they tout Diversity at the same time is only feeding the coming break-down of society, a collapse that will destroy all that the Diversity promoters dream of in that social utopia they dream of, where white men apparently pay forever, for the advancing of all others.  Of course, the formula is already failing and the collapse will come soon.  Nothing that is as dysfunctional as the present mess can last very long in the historical sense.</p>

		<p>As usual, Jupiter 7 pretty much says what needs to be said before I can say it. Myopic Governance (great name for a band, BTW), and Lance also make some welcome and pertinent comments. As some might recall from my earlier emissions, I deeply resent the loss of my home town (San Francisco) to the criminal hordes that began slinking into this country, aided by turncoat politico Dianne Feinstein and her cronies, that made S.F. the first US city to completely fall into Asian hands. The corruption of these people would shame any banana republic, the plethora of so-called legitimate business (how many greasy spoon restauraunts and &#8220;nail shops&#8221; do you need per city block?) hides multitude criminal enterprises from drug dealing and prostitution to sweat-shop trade and gambling. </p>
<p>  If the White Man&rsquo;s technology and industry were to disappear, so would the power of the paper dragons in Asia. I am sick to death of whites, that actively despise other non-white groups, praising Asians. They have no idea to the extent that these people play the system. I&rsquo;d be &#8220;hard-working&#8221; and &#8220;successful&#8221; too if I could come here, get what amounts to welfare for my expenses, free university educations, housing vouchers, business loans I never have to pay back, and the right of &#8220;re-unification&#8221; i.e., bringing my relatives over to feed off the welfare/SSI trough. I have more respect for any black welfare queen, to be perfectly honest. The danger that blacks represent is far more upfront, not insidious and slithering. </p>
<p>  As for the Asian apologists here-you&rsquo;re either white, and support your own, no exceptions, or you&rsquo;re against us. I suspect (no great insight on my part, really) that the Asian apologists have Asian spouses. They do, that is, until the spouses discover the workings of the divorce laws in their state. </p>
<p>  To the Rutgers &#8220;students&#8221; making trouble, when you should be kissing the very ground it stands on..please board the next-departing jetliner (more white technology for you to enjoy) and VAMOOSE!</p>

<p>I had to laugh (in a good way) at what you wrote. I have stated this many times on amren about those who constantly defend Asians over Whites. They, as you say, have Asian spouses or Asians within the family or they are delusional fools. The same goes for those who defend blacks, mexicans, etc. for the most part. Any fool can deduce who fits into that category among the posters here.</p>

<p>The old immigrants, compared to the new &#8220;immigrants, were the WHITE peoples of Europe. Different NATIONALITIES, not races. That alone is the DIFFERENCE. I want that moratorium to be retroactive, back to the treasonous 1965 Immigration Act that our enemies within, created, drafted and made into law. They were the same enemies who created the Civil Rights Act and forced desegregation and all the other evils upon us.</p>

		<p>As time goes by, the fact that I was born in South Korea means less and less.  I will never deny or hide the fact that I was born in a beautiful port city in South Korea, but nowadays people rarely ask me where I was born.  They do once in a while, and if they do, I will simply tell them I was born in South Korea.  But nowadays, I rarely ask anyone around me where they were born, and I am rarely asked that question either.  Of course they might recognize that I am an East Asian person by my appearance, but they do not go any further than that.  </p>

		<p>The various racial and ethnic groups that make up the American population have made contributions to American civilization. The contributions have not been of equal value. <br>
 <br>
The only value in studying something like this is that these courses require essay exams and term papers. Employers like good written and verbal skills. How much one knows about something like black history is not important to an employer. How well one is able to express what one knows may be important.  <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, these are topics that should be learned at the public library. While at college, one should learn skills that will be of obvious and immediate benefit to an employer. </p>
