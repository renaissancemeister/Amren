			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter C. Jones, The Augusta Chronicle, December 7, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The cash Savannah State&rsquo;s former football coach Robby Wells got as settlement of his reverse-discrimination lawsuit didn&rsquo;t end the matter.</p>
<p>Still pending is a separate lawsuit filed by four players Wells recruited who say they were denied the scholarships he promised because they are white. The foursome filed suit July 12 in Federal District Court in Atlanta. {snip}</p>
<p>The four claim the majority-black university withdrew Wells&rsquo; verbal scholarship offers because of their race. The state also has a policy to systematically keep SSU majority black, according to the foursome&rsquo;s attorney, Matthew Billips of Atlanta.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School officials argue that the players didn&rsquo;t get scholarship offers because of concerns they wouldn&rsquo;t have passed the academic standards. In the previous two years, 25 of players Wells gave scholarships wound up off the field for academic reasons.</p>
<p>Their home state was also an issue, rather than their race, according to the school.</p>
<p>Three of the four are from out of state. Wells replacement, Julian Dixon, recognized that scholarships for out-of-state students costs twice as much, and the program was already short of funds because Wells overspent 10 percent of the budget the previous year. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no legal requirement, NCAA requirement or Board of Regents requirement that a new coach must accept verbal offers extended by a former coach,&#8221; wrote the school&rsquo;s attorney, Eddie Snelling Jr. with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.</p>

		<p> So a black college says it refused promised scholarships to four White players because of &#8220;concerns they couldn&rsquo;t pass the academic standards&#8221;?! A thousand comedians out of work, and these administrators are trying to be funny!</p>
<p> I wonder just how many thousand black athletes in the last 20 years, alone, have had their college grades &#8220;handed&#8221; to them in order that they could continue to play center on the varsity basketball team, or running back in football? And that&rsquo;s at universities open to anyone, not just a &#8220;black majority.&#8221; My guess would be that the academic standards at a &#8220;historically black&#8221; college would be minimal, at best.</p>
<p> I hope these four White guys are awarded a big bag of swag from this &#8220;historically black&#8221; college, and that they then receive scholarships somewhere else.</p>

		<p>They should be suing regular universities, especially SEC schools.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a white player has a better chance of playing at a black college than many &#8220;white colleges.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Amazing that he would want to go there! As for the affirmative action in sports, it is immense. There are all kinds of talented white players. I recommend that you consult the website &#8220;Caste Football&#8221; on the subject of descrimination against white players who qualify or excel.</p>

		<p>This has to be the best darn joke I&rsquo;ve heard in a while. They were afraid the White kids wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pass the academic exams&hellip; At a historically black college. It&rsquo;s obvious why the Whites wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pass the exam. The questions will be culturally biased against them. Example 1) What American president ended slavery? The black administrators already had Obama as the correct answer. Example 2) Who invented the NBA? LeBron James is the answer selected by the administration. It couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been a white guy.Example 3) True or False: The most influential people in the history of the world like Jesus Christ, Babe Ruth, and Elvis. This is true according to admissions at the black college. No wonder they think the Whites can&rsquo;t pass.</p>

Exactly! There is no such thing as &#8220;reverse discrimination.&#8221; Either you have been a victim of discrimination or you have not.</p>

		<p>Funny how I live in Savannah but there is no mention of this on our most watched news network or their website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wtoc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wtoc.com/</a></p>
<p>Savannah State has long been known to be a corrupt and violent institution, there has also been quite a few shootings and rapes there as well but doing a site search at the above link revealed nothing about these. The latest being only several months ago.<br>
Go ahead and click the link above, you can see for yourself how violent this small town is due to our &#8220;diversity&#8221; from just the headlines today.</p>

		<p>So, why would ANY Whites pay money to see Savannah State games?  Anyone remember how everyone on the left was refusing to play any sports or do any business with Arizona after they passed their immigration law?  S.S. is obviously an anti-White institution that should never get one dollar of White money.</p>

<p>I think this school falls under the label &#8216;majority black college&rsquo;, which is a separate label from HBC&hellip; the things you learn from reading AmRen long enough. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you live or go to school - Every school, government office and employer is recruiting for more persons of color. There was recently one about a desperate need for black officers in the Marine corps. It never occurs to them they may have lost out to another recruiter or another college. Discrimination is the only explanation allowed or deemed sensitive enough. </p>

<p>Yes, isn&rsquo;t that always the case with white boys: great athletes, but not terribly bright. Thank goodness for diversity, or we never would have got the bomb or gone to the moon. </p>

		<p>The big issue is not whites at historically black college. These institutions continue to exist for a reason, and do produce some academic success stories which might not occur in another environment.</p>
<p>The problem is racial discrimination in sports at mainstream institutions. This works against whites in football and basketball and perhaps against blacks in other sports.</p>
<p>Largely, I think occurs on a coach and athletic director level. These people live with the risk of failure, and the best response for them is seek as much anonymity as they can obtain. If they put up an overwhelmingly black football or basketball team and they lose, they get less attention than if they lost with more white players. In baseball, they might recruit and play whites for the same reason, cover and anonymity.</p>
<p>There might be other reasons both physical and social why a particular group might succeed in a particular sport ahead of others. But I don&rsquo;t think that come close to fully explaining the demographics of college and professional sports in North America.</p>

<p>It is definitely an HBC, I have lived here in Savannah all of my life (over 40 years) and they pride themselves on this.<br>
Only in the past decade or so have any whites been taught there and I believe it&rsquo;s because UGA has a Marine Biology program located there since the college runs parallel to the Wilmington Rivers banks.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing. We are constantly hearing about how the US is a &#8220;racist&#8221; society. Yet here we have a clear example of out and out discrimination against white students and do you think that this will be an episode in any television documentary on the civil rights struggle? Or be brought up by the NAACP and other self-appointed guardians of civil liberties? </p>
<p>For that matter, will your average white person even care about how he or she is being dispossessed in their own country?</p>
