			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cathal Dervan, Irish Central, December 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Dublin conference has heard that Ireland&rsquo;s economic recession is fuelling racism in the country  &mdash;  as immigrants are perceived to present a &#8216;threat&rsquo; to jobs for native Irish.</p>
<p>The Immigrant Council of Ireland celebrated its 10th anniversary with the seminar, which heard founder, Sister Stan Kennedy describe the co-relation between the country&rsquo;s economic woes and recent racist incidents.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a growing perception that migrants are a threat to Ireland and the &#8216;native&rsquo; Irish, and are unfairly benefiting from Irish jobs, entitlements and public services,&#8221; said Sr Kennedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The increasing levels of racism emerging in recent times can be attributed in part to such misconceptions. Racist abuse has varied from spitting, pushing and beating people up to shouting and verbal abuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lack of clarity on immigration policy, while the immigration system remains chaotic, bureaucratic, cumbersome and lacking in transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system is being reviewed by the Government, but there remains a high level of discretion for the Minister for Justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former Irish President Mary Robinson also addressed the Dublin conference.</p>
<p>She told delegates, &#8220;Negative attitudes to immigration are dangerous and must not be tolerated in a civilised society. This attitude is often not based on a real threat to jobs or livelihoods, rather that when things are bad there is a temptation to look around for someone to blame.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the boom is over, many migrants are now part of Irish society. Immigrants are making a terrific contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economy and our society. That contribution must be celebrated and valued.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigrant Council of Ireland chief executive Denise Charlton told the meeting that Ireland had changed from a &#8216;white, predominantly Catholic society to something very different now&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She remarked that there are about 35,000 newly naturalised Irish citizens in the country and about 500,000 immigrants in total.</p>
<p>Charlton said, &#8220;In some respects it is increasingly a case of &#8216;them and us&rsquo; and unless people change their attitude and see Ireland as a multicultural society, racism will remain a long-term problem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I saw a video documentary recently about african, arab and indopak immigrants to ireland.  They all complained about racism, about all the schools being catholic and not getting enough government sponsored welfare.  After about 15 minutes I felt like I was watching the opposite of sanity.  </p>
<p>Liberals will tell you that that guy from zimbabwe lurking outside O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s pub in Dublin is &#8216;Irish&rsquo; because he is a citizen of the country.  I hate it when liberals deny the existence of bona fide ethnic groups among the white race.</p>
<p>No one can be Irish or Welsh or German or Swede except for someone born into those ETHNIC groups and from those bloodlines.  No matter how hard I try, no one will ever say I&rsquo;m Chinese even if I manage to move there and get residency.  </p>
<p>Why do liberals want us to call arabs, africans, asians and other non-whites the same names as european ethnic groups whose particular characteristics go back hundreds or thousands of years?</p>

		<p>I do not have a problem with temporary visitors to Ireland.  But, Kennedy, Robinson and Charlton need to be kicked out of Ireland ASAP along with the immigrants they so blindly defend.  Ireland should remain ethnically Irish.  However, the Catholic part may be at the root of the immigration problem.</p>
<p>And I say this as an ethnically Irish, Irish citizen!<br/>

		<p>The Irish people - those &#8220;native&#8221; Irish - had the good sense to vote against the European Union. That was when they were a prosperous nation with one of the finest economies in the world. Their ruling class - mainly British descendants - would not  accept that. They forced a new vote to bring in the EU. It passed by a narrow margin. Result? Ireland is broke and full of immigrants from the third world. Connect the dots!</p>

		<p>Unless people change their attitudes! How about the governing class changing theirs! Of course, that aint gonna happen &amp; the Irish who resisted the Protestant Ascendancy for 300 years are about to be torpedoed by the pro-immigration Catholic church which they valiantly defended. Multicultural Ireland will consist, does consist of ethnic groups in a  struggle for power until one prevails. How about the Islamic Rep of Eire in 2020!</p>

		<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;unless people change their attitude and see Ireland as a multicultural society&#8221;.</p>
<p>I missed the part where the free people of &#8216;Democratic&rsquo; Ireland got to vote on that decision to be a multicultural society.<br/>
In reality there is an endless list of questions that us peons aren&rsquo;t allowed to ask, let alone answer.</p>
<p>Look at last weeks story (Dec 9th) on the German RW National &#8216;Democratic&rsquo; Party who are anti immigration, being investigated to be banned for having anti democratic views, or look to how the anti immigration BNP has been treated by all sides of politics and the press in the UK.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re repeatedly denied any sort of democratic choice on immigration, as those sort of important decisions are left to &#8216;our betters&rsquo;, who always know what&rsquo;s best for us all, such as when they let all of these immigrants into Ireland in the first place to no doubt &#8216;grow the economy&rsquo;, who are now telling the Irish people to &#8220;play nice&#8221; now that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s less jobs with more mouths to feed.</p>
<p>Democracy in the West reminds me of Henry Ford&rsquo;s famous quote on the model-T &#8220;the people can have any color they like as long as it&rsquo;s black&#8221;.   </p>

		<p>This points to one of the Achilles Heels in our worldview.  For the most part, it gains traction during a bad economy.  In the case of Ireland, it really ought not matter the state of the economy.  Ireland should be for the Irish if the economy is good or bad.  The fundamental nationalist drive for Ireland shouldn&rsquo;t be a depressed economy, but the very name &#8220;Ireland.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sad truth of the matter is that President Obama would easily win re-election if the economy was in recovery.  When he should lose re-election and never have won it to begin with precisely because a white country should not have a black President, period.</p>

		<p>Ireland received a loan to stave off default, but they&rsquo;re still deep in debt and austerity measures will have to be increased in the coming year, just as in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal.  All four countries will probably be the first dominoes to fall, with France and Britain not far behind.</p>
<p>For the self-appointed elites to not understand that people everywhere do not like foreigners in their lands, especially if they take up needed jobs or social benefits that they feel should go to them, is just short of amazing.</p>
<p>Or are they so arrogant they know that but believe their Big Brother mantras will be enough to fool everybody until prosperity returns to satisfy their greed for power and money?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ireland had changed from a &lsquo;white, predominantly Catholic society to something very different now&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Being a traditionally religious population, the Irish view everything in familiar, simplistic moral terms.  Multi-racial ideology sounds similar to Biblical decrees to &#8216;love thy neighbor&rsquo;and &#8216;care for the wretched&rsquo;, making it seem in accordance with the teachings they&rsquo;ve lived with for centuries.</p>
<p>For this reason, it took only a small leap of time and logic to graft recent Marxist multicultural ideology onto time-honoured Christian Catholic ways of thinking.  </p>
<p>The poor Irish cannot find a moral correlation between racial nationalism and the articles of their religion, therefore any pro-Irish, white racial theme is assumed to be &#8216;sinful&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Incredibly, racial suicide seems to be the only morally acceptable option for Irish traditionalists. </p>

		<p>Racism against the native irish and ethnic displacement will remain a serious problem until non-white immigration is expliciitly stopped in white countries.</p>
<p>How is that in EVERY whiet country the elected elite are completely against the ethnic interests and survival of the population.</p>
<p>&#8216;The contribution of immigrants must be celebrated and valued&rsquo;  &mdash;  - well what if I don&rsquo;t value their contribution in MY country.  What if I want other things?????</p>
<p>Its genocide and needs to be opposed as such.</p>

		<p>As an American, I fondly remember traveling throughout Ireland some 40 years ago&hellip;it was a quaint and somewhat backward and insular country then&hellip;rampant alcoholism was the norm, anyway..many Irishmen had never ventured farther than a few miles from their own homes in their lifetime&hellip;when visiting a small country pub for a pint, I was keenly observed by the locals who were eager to match wits with the &#8220;Yank&#8221; as I was called by them. Most of them had never met a black and were relentless in their denunciation of Americans in regards to how they had been taught American blacks had been so &#8220;mistreated.&#8221;. I am delighted to see that the proverbial chickens have now come home to roost in their own country as they are overrun with unassimilatable Nigerians. How do you like black crime and welfare dependency now?   </p>

That&rsquo;s funny, because I would say this statement by Ms. Robinson is even MORE dangerous in a civilised society. She is suggesting that any opinion other than her own be shut down and not tolerated. Does she see the irony, I wonder?</p>

		<p>500,000 immigrants in Ireland?! WOW! That is a staggeringly high total for such a small country with a very low population. And one with no history or tradition of immigration at all. Talk about not learning from Great Britain&rsquo;s disaster.</p>

		<p>My Mother was in Ireland three years ago. She was in a local pub there with her sisters. They got to talkimg to a townsman, who stated that many of the Brazilians are lazy and won&rsquo;t work. He said the Ghanians are worse, alonh with Mauritanians, Senegales, etc&hellip; Anyone guess what thse,countries have in common? Brazil is basically a black S.

		<p>After 700 years of english occupation and slavery, Ireland deserves their freedoom in their own country. Third world immigration is highly negative and has no merits at all. The Irish have historically exported their own young people all over the world and it would be foolish to replace them with blacks and browns.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re touching on one of the most important problems facing white survival in Europe.  Many neighboring nations have long histories of opposition.  It is to the point that they like seeing them destroyed by immigration.  This is the same of course, with political enemies.  Everyone knows that the Labour Party led by Tony Blair intentionally flooded Britain with non-whites just to hammer diversity  and multiculturalism on the heads of social conservatives.  The same in Scandinavian nations.  One could hope that they damage immigrants do to their hosts would change policy, and there are a few signs of that, but it is too likely that it won&rsquo;t be enough, or too little, too late.  </p>
<p>The demise of the white race will lead to the demise of the entire civilized world.  We ought to set up a monument somewhere and chisel that on it.  That way, the miserable, diseased, and starving hordes left behind will know that we warned them.</p>

		<p>The dark secret which didn&rsquo;t seem to matter to much for a long time: Sinn Fein are Marxists. Most of the guys who fought didn&rsquo;t know or care, but the higher ups did. They were at the Internationale along with all the rest. It explains alot of post World War Ireland - certainly the way the Church is treated now.</p>

<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>Agreed. But I am much more optimistic that these ancient White vs White conflicts/grudges are winding down. I haven&rsquo;t heard much about Irish Nationalists Catholics bombing British Protestants in Ulster/Northern Ireland lately and i sense that Whites in this contested areas are now aware that their White vs White differences are nothing as bad as what happens in London, Oldham with Blacks, Paki Muslim child rapists.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one area where we regular American Renaissance readers can make a difference:</p>
<p>On a personal level, work to make peace between traditional White vs White enemies:</p>
<p>Try to arrange friendships or even marriages between say White Germans and White Slavs (the children a really great, smart, handsome and tough) or White Southerners and Whites from Midwestern/Northern states (Hey Whites in Dixie, the White Civil War is over, stop hating on Yankees). And whenever you hear some White Christian hating on some other Christian church denomination saying that Catholics or Latter Day Saints aren&rsquo;t really &#8220;Christians&#8221; - don&rsquo;t allow this poison to go unchallenged. </p>

<p>The poor Irish cannot find a moral correlation between racial nationalism and the articles of their religion, therefore any pro-Irish, white racial theme is assumed to be &lsquo;sinful&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Incredibly, racial suicide seems to be the only morally acceptable option for Irish traditionalists. <br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br/>
All lies. The traditional Irish sentiment has always been that their &#8220;neighbors&#8221; need to stay home. That was what the Troubles were all about. </p>
<p>When masses of foreigners enter Ireland and make demands it provokes Hibernia&rsquo;s wrath. Official Multiculturalism ensures that she will never be at peace. </p>
<p>May the DRM win the day!</p>

		<p>This article and the similar article on Sweden are just another pathetic elite attempt at damage control.  The horse is out of the barn, and it&rsquo;s too late because people really are noticing what&rsquo;s going on.  The Irish in particular are asking themselves if there isn&rsquo;t something wrong with this picture:  over centuries they had to leave their nation and settle elsewhere and transform themselves into another nationality, only to have alien non-Irish take up residence and call themselves &#8220;Irish.&#8221;  While those of 100% Irish blood, heritage, genetics etc. are to be known as Americans, Australians, English, etc.  No one can  help noticing the peculiarity of it.  And wondering why it&rsquo;s being done, and why traitors like Mary Robinson and Sister Nutcase Kennedy are not driven off the island and set adrift in a boat full of Africans.  The attempt at the population replacement of Europe is truly the most amazing and disgusting thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  As things get worse, more and more white Europeans will become angry as what&rsquo;s been done crystallizes from the present fog into clarity.  I hope I&rsquo;m alive to see that day.</p>

		<p>Snowwhitey: No, it isn&rsquo;t the Catholic Church so much, as it is the Liberal indoctrination that has seeped into every vestage of Irish culture, as well as in other European countries. </p>
<p>I saw a documentary about how the Orange Order was bringing over black Africans who were &#8220;Orangemen&#8221; in their home African countries. They were &#8220;proud&#8221; to have them in their Order, and in their country, Ulster. For what reason would they be proud? </p>
<p>Just because they belong to the same Order doesn&rsquo;t make them a White Irish Loyalist, any more than being Catholic, or going to a Catholic School, makes the Arabs, blacks, and Pakis, Irish Catholics. </p>
<p>The root of all our problems is Liberalism, which aids and abbets Communism, in its destruction of Western Civilization. </p>

		<p>#9: &#8220;Love Thy Neighbor&#8221; in the case of the Irish should be a family in Kerry sending money, or some other type of assistance to a family, or charity, in Tyrone, not to people in Pakistan, or Africa. </p>
<p>Charity begins at home. Help your own, first. </p>

		<p>Jack #23: The Old IRA which was featured in the movie, &#8220;Michael Collins&#8221; or in &#8220;The Quiet Man&#8221; is gone. From the quotes that I have read, and other related stories, the New IRA is nothing but a bunch of Communist murderers. </p>
<p>They were bent on making Ireland into a Socialist Republic, using Marx, Lenin, and drawing from Mao&rsquo;s &#8220;Red Book&#8221; and Colonel Qaddafy&rsquo;s &#8220;Green Book&#8221;. That should tell you everything that you need to know about the IRA. They are watermelons: Green on the outside, and Red on the inside. </p>
