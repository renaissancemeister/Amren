<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=375557">Judeo-Christian Values? Not in Our Classrooms!</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Carl, World Net Daily, December 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A strategy proposed to the Burlington, Vt., school board attacks the &#8220;negatives&#8221; of the Judeo-Christian heritage and suggests its elimination, according to critics of the stunning plan.</p>
<p>Pastor Larry Czelusta believes that the Task Force Report on the Recommended Strategic Plan for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for the Burlington School District&#8221; is a document that is openly hostile to Christianity and biblical values.</p>
<p>Czelusta said one of the report&rsquo;s passages openly declare its objections to Christianity and says that the Judeo-Christian culture perpetuates inequality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditional educational practices are maintained with no critique of existing inequities in any aspect of the school or the education system. Curricula, pedagogies, counseling practices, and all other aspect of education continue to reflect primarily White, male, upper middle class, Christian, and other privileged perspectives and approaches,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that schools have to deal with social issues in children on levels never seen before. The breakdown of families is huge. Education is not always a priority for parents,&#8221; Czelusta said.</p>
<p>However, he said that the school board&rsquo;s unanimous reception of the report is a step toward a rejection of the heritage that fostered the growth and development of the city of Burlington.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some examples of the report&rsquo;s wording:</p>
<blockquote>As a general backdrop to each subcommittee&rsquo;s conversations, Task Force members agreed that the overarching challenge the District must meet is how to close the achievement gap that indicates students who belong to a minority group lag behind white, able bodied, heterosexual, middle class students in academic success, participation in extra-curricular activites, graduation rates, entry into college, and enrollment in honors and AP classes. In the Task Force&rsquo;s view, the activities, practices and policies that will minimize and eventually eliminate this achievement gap represent an anti-racist stance against the conventional white, middle class, Judeo-Christian culture that invisibly permeates the current social environment that exists in the Burlington Schools.
<p>{snip}</blockquote></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Czelusta believes that the task force&rsquo;s report will be gladly embraced in Burlington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Burlington will applaud this task force report. According to the school&rsquo;s website, the entire council approved the report  &mdash;  unanimously!&#8221; Czelusta said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an interview with WND, Collins echoed the statement that appears on her blog.</p>
<p>&#8220;The report is the work of a task force of community members. The task force was appointed by the school board and charged with the request to identify and research and provide best practices around being an inclusive and welcoming environment in the schools,&#8221; [Burlington Superintendent Jeanne] Collins said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The task force wrote the report, so I can&rsquo;t really comment on the language they need to use,&#8221; Collins said.</p>
<p>Collins said the report was received by the school board, not completely adopted &#8220;lock, stock and barrel.&#8221; She also said a committee was formed to work on implementing the report&rsquo;s findings.</p>

<p>The reason the breakdown of families is occurring is because of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; to begin with, and the propaganda for the same in the media.  But the idea that parents aren&rsquo;t always concerned with their children&rsquo;s education in Vermont tells me that there must be many non-whites planted there recently, who look around and see the successful, traditional white American and hate it.  I think that Vermont and New Hampshire were early hotbeds for suffragette movement, and so it is also a hotbed of feminism.  So what do we get;  attacks against the notion of white MEN and their assumed Christianity, with the quiet implication that Muslims also find this unfair to them. </p>
<p>Little do they guess that they are diversifying themselves to pieces.</p>

		<p>More &#8220;let&rsquo;s handicap the majority so that the (non NAM) minorities can gain parity&#8221;.</p>
<p>More lowering of standards across the board for all as to accommodate the few, on a national level this &#8220;everyone must run slower so we all win&#8221; mentality is just so uncompetitive, uninspiring, un Western and so counterproductive when looking at competing globally.</p>
<p>Having the slowest traveler being the pace setter for the entire group is a lovely maternal ideal, but in reality this approach causes nothing but resentment and frustration from the faster travelers, granted it is a good way of keeping everyone bunched together.</p>
<p>The only way I can see that this &#8220;everyone is good&#8221; ideal could work, is if you compartmentalize peoples of differing achievement ranges (as we have always done), as to give each tier it&rsquo;s own levels of goals to reach for.</p>
<p>This &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; mentality, other than giving the authors of such initiatives some temporary relief from their own decadent internal guilt, really just benefits the nation&rsquo;s opponents. <br>
From a white, able bodied, heterosexual, middle class male point of view it feels like we&rsquo;ve lost some quiet *&rsquo;soft&rsquo; war that was devoid of guns and tanks, but yet the land that we stand on somehow no longer belongs to same people from as recent as 40 years ago.</p>
<p>*Similar to the &#8216;soft&rsquo; invasions that our countries are currently experiencing.</p>

		<p>Evidently the schools in Burlington are being overrun by non-whites and the silly libs have no idea how to teach them, so they theorize it must be that terrible &#8220;white, middle class&#8221; culture that&rsquo;s at fault.  </p>
<p>The usual remedy for such intrusions of reality onto the lib plane of existence is to promote the non-whites along and make them someone else&rsquo;s problem.  </p>
<p>Leftists are so delusional.    </p>

		<p>Oh course there is no such thing as &#8220;White genocide&#8221;. </p>
<p>Nah&hellip;can&rsquo;t be. After all, only the most dedicated and virulent White supremacist would see this as anything other than &#8220;favorable&#8221;! And to this end, it is truly &#8220;fashionable&#8221; to eliminate White, heterosexual, males from being a part of the school curricula, either in the decision making process or from being featured in the curricula itself. </p>
<p>Anyone who opposes this is one of those previously mentioned &#8220;dedicated and virulent White supremacists&#8221;&hellip;right?</p>
<p>This process is nothing new. Hell, even Glen Beck&hellip;the fool that he is has objected to George Washington being removed from school history books, monuments, street names and public buildings.</p>
<p>But remember&hellip;there is no such things &#8220;White genocide&#8221;&hellip;right.</p>

		<p>Why is it that the Liberal minorities insane ideas hold more weight than what the conservatie majority wants ? Everything Christian and European American is under attack in the USA, and the Liberal morons do not realize that those traditional values are what made this the greatest nation on earth. <br>
So now our kids are forced to lear about Kwanaza, a fabricated prison holiday created by a rapist, and have to call one of our own symbols a holiday tree so as not to offend anyone ?<br>
Sorry for the rant .. I just cant make sense of it all anymore.<br>
Liberalism is indeed a mental disorder.</p>

		<p>They call theirs an &#8220;anti-racist stance&#8221;, yet not only whites are Christian, heterosexual, able-bodied, or even middle class.  So why mention all these words at all?  Because they have a general &#8220;victim&#8221; agenda.</p>
<p>But yes, the handed-down culture of Vermont does hopefully permeate Vermont schools.  When those who don&rsquo;t fit arrive, then dismantling the culture seems to be the liberal choice.</p>

		<p>Look for Burlington, VT to be the next fill-in-the-blank once great and prosperous cities of the Northeast. Once great but collapsing due to uninvited invaders from the marxist ideologies and think tanks. Parts of NYC, Phila, Boston, Syracuse, Albany, Erie PA, Cleveland, Ohio, many parts of the Rust Belt fit the bill.</p>
<p>Watch the high achieving White kids and their families leave the school and townships in large numbers. Maybe,one,day that city will return to high academic achieving status, as China and South Koreans find their way here. Unless gentrification takes hold don&rsquo;t count on European Americans to come back.</p>

		<p>My gosh!!  This is one of the most disheartening articles I have ever read!! I know that Vermont is one of the most whitest states remaining in the nation, and I assume that the Burlington School Board is white too  &mdash;    so why would they enthusiastically embrace the goals from this &#8220;Task Force&#8221;?  Are the board members self-haters who hate themselves, their kids, and their ancestors?  And who is this &#8220;Task Force&#8221;?  I&rsquo;ll bet it must be an extreme left-wing and neo-Marxist group; very similar to the so-called Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which to me should stand for Society for the Propogation of Leftism and Communism!!  It just kills me that a school board would bash their own flesh and blood!!</p>

		<p>This task force seems to be repeating some of the rants and ravings that were popular with university students back in the 70s. But it could get worse! This &#8220;Task Force&#8221; mays have observed that some of these so called white middle class Christian hetrosexual males actually work for a living and pay the taxes that support this task force.And shock horror, they may even notice that some of this Christianity has a Calvinistic slant which sort of says &#8220;God helps those who help themselves&#8221;!</p>
<p>I would now suggest that this task force gets on with the business of teaching 5 year olds how to read, write, do sums and speak properly. Then teach them if they do these things properly that they too may get a degree and a well paid job and enjoy all the benefits that our society has to offer.</p>

		<p>Stunning.  All those council members - just what culture do they think they live in?  Can you imagine any other race of people saying in effect that their culture is bad and needs to be erased?</p>
<p>Can you imagine that happening anywhere else but here?</p>
<p>Other races and cultures are laughing at us.  NONE of them are doing what we are doing, even though they are more barbaric than ours could ever be.  Why do you think they are all leaving their homelands to come here.  WE made a great place to live.  They live in horrible places filled with corruption, violence and backwards cultural values.</p>
<p>I wonder if that same council in Vermont would embrace the cultural &#8216;vibrancy&rsquo; of honor killings, machismo killings, buying young girls as brides or genital mutilation.  Hey, who are they to judge, since their own culture, according to them, is so &#8216;bad&rsquo; that it needs replacement with foreign cultures.</p>

		<p>Wow, they&rsquo;re not even trying to hide their hatred of Whitey anymore are they? But I suppose it&rsquo;s better they come right out and admit it for all the country to see instead of playing their silly little games about their agenda. I&rsquo;m not kidding when I tell you that I&rsquo;ve told my own kids to be prepared to home school their own children when they start their families, because in the next 15 years, there won&rsquo;t be a decent public school fit for a White child. </p>

<p>Hello! Judeo Christian values are the reason why this system that everybody wants to reap the goodies from has been so successful. There are alternate pathways to success, as Japan and later other Asian countries showed us, but there isn&rsquo;t much about our two favorite minority groups and the practicers of the religion-of-peace that reflects a formula for success at much of anything.</p>

		<p>I have a desire to see the unemployment rate of graduates of this school compared to the average for the nation.  I&rsquo;d also like to know if the percentage of kids in this school who go to college is higher than the percentage of kids nationwide who go to college.</p>
<p>This would be an excellent way to help determine if there&rsquo;s a &#8220;problem&#8221; in the first place.</p>
<p>[Post-script: turns out you can look up the town on wikipedia and see that it&rsquo;s unemployment rate and average salary are both better than the national average (lower and higher, respectively).]</p>

		<p>Burlington has long been a haven for extreme left wingers who wanted to escape from NYC to the idealistic country life. Unfortunately in grouping together like that they are able to overpower any existing culture and replace it with their own agenda which is far from the independent, hard working, religious, patriotic, and traditional New Englander.</p>

<p>Minor correction.   Judeo-Christianity is an absolute oxymoron.  And, for anyone who might be uninformed and wish to argue this very easily discredited attempt to combine these two opposing religious ideologies, fire up Google and enter the following search string:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Myth of a Judeo-Christian Tradition<br>
 The following article from New Dawn Magazine No.23 Feb-March 1994.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the technically challenged, here is the actual link that will take you to this very educational article:</p>
<p>www.biblebelievers.org.au/judeochr.htm</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>Oh, and after you finish reading this outstanding article - I ask that you remember what you have learned every time you hear one of our deceitful, conniving, dishonest Politicians (or TV preachers) get up on TV and utter or try to peddle this &#8216;Judeo-Christian&rsquo; nonsense.  </p>

		<p>And here we go again. The last time I was in Burlington, it was at least twenty years ago&hellip;but the city was as a White as any part of America circa 1940&rsquo;s-50&rsquo;s! It was a beautiful, clean and homogeneous city. ALl that is obviously over now, just as with so many areas. Now Leftists and non-Whites rule the day.  </p>

		<p>You Americans are so under the influence of liberal propaganda that you&rsquo;ve become only commentators of liberal actions. You don&rsquo;t need to do that. This is racist! And you need to say this loudly. This is a way to win. Attack is the best defence. You are on the run and you have the case. Shout &#8220;stop discriminating white people you liberal bigots!&#8221; Times had canged. They are the elite and we the counterculture. We need to attack them like they did it in the 1960s. Now it our turn to point to their hypocrisy. Don&rsquo;t be afraid we are on the side of right and justice and majority of people will see that. Just give them facts of liberal racism against whites. People are ultimately suckers for the truth.</p>

		<p>Why not just ban white kids from school?  Make it illegal to teach white kids to read and the black kids should catch up in no time!  </p>
<p>ANOTHER plan to drag whites down so that blacks can be seen as equals!  Oh boy, I&rsquo;ll be it works&hellip;.this time!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, forced bussing, spending MORE on black schools than white, Afro-centric curriculum, more black teachers, more blacks in text books, charter schools, didn&rsquo;t work but I&rsquo;ll bet this plan does! lol</p>

		<p>People keep talking about Vermont being almost all white.  In the past few weeks, Gov. Peter Shumlin has openly begged for Somalians and Mexicans to move to Vermont.  Evidently, Mexicans are needed to do the farm work that white Vermont residents just won&rsquo;t do.  Even though Vermont is supposed to be the epitome of family farms.</p>

		<p>Folks, Burlington is still overwhelmingly white. The last census puts the percentage of whites at 93%. Asians and Hispanics make up the rest, with blacks around 1%. So this pathetic report is an example of credentialed leftists with too much time on their hands looking for problems to solve when there actually are none.<br>
These are bored white people self segregating themselves into a whiteopia, but feeling subliminally bad for doing so because it contradicts their progressive fantasies.<br>
Basically, a bunch of ethnomasochistic whites who don&rsquo;t want to experience the REAL diversity of NYC or Boston and all it&rsquo;s attendant problems, but want to compete with each other in a transparent status game of progressive oneupmanship. These are clueless liberals trying to impress each other and themselves that they are the ultimate exemplars of post modern multicultural theory, all the while living as far from real racial diversity as you can get.<br>
It&rsquo;s a vain display of white liberalism. Meanwhile, next door in New Hampshire, you have a VERY conservative state with a white population at more than 94% of the total. And they don&rsquo;t feel guilty about it.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine if a good many White Nationalists moved to Vermont or New Hampshire, and by sheer numbers were able to control their Legislatures, and Executive Branches, and wrote a great deal of pro-White legislation? </p>

		<p>Caleo is correct.</p>
<p>I know VT well which is why I&rsquo;m surprised that Diverse People can&rsquo;t keep up with those smug white Burlington fools.  Many Vermonters are deeply stupid.  The state was overrun by brain-dead hippies in the 70&rsquo;s &amp; losers like Howard Dean. I feel sorry for the true Vermonters whose families have been there for generations but I do believe they will fight back.  Once the Somalis have established a foothold, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time. How long before Vermont&rsquo;s gun laws are changed?</p>

		<p>Caleo hit the nail right on the head. Try living in a truly diverse city like Baltimore (wow), Detroit (egad) or Philly (Help!).</p>
<p>What a pack of self loathing, masochistic, snotty, rich white liberals, spewing the cultural Marxism their little hunchbacked, beady eyed, twisted, vile, loathsome white college  &#8220;professors&#8221; drummed into their heads full of air, by rote.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re making a joke, but in fact this is a good answer to all the whining about &#8220;white racism&#8221; from non-whites and liberals.  Don&rsquo;t like White, male, etc. influence in the schools?  Then let&rsquo;s have separate schools for non-whites where their  &#8220;perspectives and approaches&#8221; can be used.  And give us our own to run as we will.  Tired of &#8220;white racism?&#8221;  Move away from us, and stop following us around,  it&rsquo;s a big country.  The whole &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; campaign is just a fraud to soften the white population up so non-whites can sponge off us, and the political left can bypass democracy.  </p>

<p>Academic psychobabble for, &#8216;We can&rsquo;t get a real job, so we&rsquo;ve created tens of thousands of these useless departments, so we can extort billions of dollars in the last 4+ decades from people who support us with their tax dollars (i.e. those evil straight Christian and Jewish conservative white males).&#8221;</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve always said, I think there was some kind of genetic mutation within the white race 50 years ago. One branch (who mutated) became guilt-ridden, self-loathing, self-destructive socialists and then there were&hellip; the rest of us.</p>

Yes, one would need a couple double martinis to see the Gospel of<br>
John has being Judeo-Christian.  Of course, I expect the Gospel of<br>
John to be declared hate literature by Morris Dees within another<br>
five years ( at the rate of cultural meltdown we see before us )</p>

		<p>These ghostbusters were being rather upfront in their mission statement that &#8220;the conventional white, middle class, Judeo-Christian culture &hellip;. INVISIBLY permeates the current social environment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Being unable to think of any other reason for the achievement gap, because of their belief in equality, they lay the blame on a phantom, the evil male white middle-class culture, or in short: the (white) devil.<br>
