			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ralph Richard Banks, New York Times, December 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 1 in 10 black men in their 20s or early 30s are currently incarcerated, and some experts estimate that as many as 1 in 4 black men will spend some time behind bars.</p>
<p>Only half of black boys graduate high school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black men&rsquo;s difficulties arise partly for reasons beyond their control  &mdash;  failing schools, a changing labor market, mass incarceration  &mdash;  but they nonetheless leave black men less able to fulfill the role of husband.</p>
<p>The harsh truth is that as black women have moved ahead, black men have fallen behind. Each year, nearly twice as many black women as men graduate college. Black women have surpassed their male counterparts even in lucrative and typically male-dominated fields like computer science. Twice as many black women as men go to graduate school, and in law and medicine, the gender gap is approaching 2 to 1 as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Compounding the numbers problem is that black men marry interracially more than twice as frequently as do black women. More than 1 in 5 black men now marry a non-black spouse (compared to fewer than 1 in 10 black women who do so).</p>

<p>No, black men&rsquo;s difficulties arise from their love of evil. Whites are also victims of failing schools, changing labor markets, and mass crime, but somehow manage to avoid black levels of psychopathy.</p>
<p>Every race has troubles, yet somehow when it happens to blacks, it&rsquo;s &#8220;beyond their control&#8221;. What precisely is within the control of blacks? If they are so godlike, why are they eternally victims?</p>

<p>But even when they easily could &#8220;fulfill the role of husband&#8221; and father and crossing out the honeydo list, a lot of them don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What is amusing is that the standard for being an &#8220;eligible&#8221; man isn&rsquo;t very high, according to this.  All one needs to do is graduate from high school and not commit enough serious felonies to get sent to prison.  Most black high schools aren&rsquo;t that rigorous, and the criminal justice system in black cities does everything it can to keep from sending black men to prison.</p>

<p>How about an average IQ that falls below every other group, higher levels of testosterone&hellip; </p>
<p>As for the shortage of spouses for black women, if their men would stop chasing females of other races this problem wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad. Then again, whites deserve some of the blame for this.  Fifty years ago romantic relaionships between blacks and whites were considered unthinkable by more than 90% of American whites. Now, having been bullied into believing that such beliefs are &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;bigoted&#8221; we see more a more young people - especially girls- being swept up in this trend.  </p>

		<p>What the article fails to mention, is that no one even blacks, want to marry an overweight obnoxious, arrogant and lazy black woman. Black males going to jail for crimes they commit are but a fraction of the problem.</p>

		<p>Easily explained statistic.  Blacks like their women with huge butts.  But if they can get huge butts without &#8220;attitude&#8221; better yet.  Now you know where all the fat WHITE women are going.  As for fat black women, nobody wants them.  Period.  Of course, a race that all too often is caught having sex with animals will gladly service fat black women, but stay with them?  Marry them?  Nope.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing that same old refrain my whole life. it&rsquo;s always presented as some great crisis. There&rsquo;s no shortage of black males whatsoever; just walk down the streets of any city and you&rsquo;ll see scores everywhere. If that 20% that marry out could be convinced to quit chasing other types of women then that would constitute a great upsurge in the supply right there.</p>

		<p>I have read several articles this year that discuss the issue of White Male/Black female marriages. The New York Times did a front page story on two couples earlier this year. </p>
<p>When I lived in Denver, there was a White guy who was absolutely gorgeous! He looked like the marlboro man. He was from Montana. This probably accounted for his naiveness in regards to race. </p>
<p>He always seemed to be friendly toward Blacks and other non-Whites. He also was engaged to a bi-racial Black woman. </p>
<p>The media has a lot to do with this subtle social engineering.<br>

		<p>The dysgenic effects of the modern welfare state can be seen in the reproductive patterns of bright females, white and, most particularly, black: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The welfare state is, of course, highly dysgenic. It takes the sting out of reckless procreation, which is most likely to be practiced by the unfit. </p>
<p>&#8220;Dysgenic fertility differs by sex. It is greater for women than for men, and this is true at both ends of the fitness scale. That is, compared to men, the most able women have even fewer babies and the least able women have even more. The burden of childrearing falls more heavily on women, so at the top end of the fitness scale, many smart, ambitious women put off having children while they establish careers. By the time they decide to have children, they may be infertile or able to have only one or two. At the same time, most women still want to marry men who are smarter and better educated than themselves, and the pool of potential mates becomes very small for the smartest women.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;These dysgenic effects are worse for blacks than for whites. Many low-IQ black women have many children, whereas smart, educated black women cannot find black men at their own social level. The average intelligence of blacks is therefore falling faster than that of whites.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think Banks pulled his &ldquo;more than 1 in 5 black men now marry a non-black spouse&rdquo; idea out of his own sick fantasies. Maybe it&rsquo;s from the same part of his brain that deemed the high incarceration rate of black males as &ldquo;beyond their control&rdquo;. According to the 2010 US Census 4.6% of married Afro-Am females and 10.8% of married Afro-Am males had non-black spouses. Remember this is coming from a group that seldom marries.<br>
Table FG3 https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hh-fam/cps2010.html<br>
More importantly, Whites are the least likely to interracially marry. 2.1% of married White women and 2.3% of married White men had a non-White spouse. <br>
Also, every time AR posts an article about race mixing some of the men start complaining that black males are &ldquo;taking all the hot white women&rdquo;. If you actually think that more than 1% of the white &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; that marry/date blacks are &ldquo;hot&rdquo; you need to stop watching MTV and work on your self-esteem. In reality they are taking out our trash.</p>

<p>How are any of these &#8220;beyond their control&#8221;? Maybe if they would go to school to acually study their schools wouldn&rsquo;t &#8220;fail&#8221; and they&rsquo;d be able to change with the labor market and stay out of jail.<br>
And another thing, why are black women outperforming black males? Don&rsquo;t they also go to those same &#8220;failing&rsquo; schools, isn&rsquo;t the labor market changing for them also?     </p>

<p>HUH??!! Black men are &#8216;mass incarcerated&rsquo; because they commit tremendous and hugely disproportionate amounts of crime, not for &#8220;reasons beyond their control&#8221;. This may be the most assinine comment I have ever read. Not only is political correctness making American journalism dishonest but it is dumbing it down to an idiocracy.</p>

Thank you Istvan for confirming this truth. Every now and then we get posters who claim that those of us who post such comments are &#8220;trolls&#8221; &#8220;Black posters&#8221; or &#8220;marxists etc&hellip; </p>
<p>This may be true in some cases, but I am just telling my fellow AMREN posters what I have seen. Obviously you have seen such a sad spectacle too.</p>

I realize that you are being cyniclal; however, the sad fact is that that White male/Black female couples are becoming more commonplace. Interstingly enough, these pairings often tend to be middle class or higher in income. </p>

		<p>I was in a local coffee shop here in the southwest a few weeks ago and I saw a White male\Black female couple. The man was a man&rsquo;s man to a tee. He was of good height, well built, attractive and could probably have pretty much any woman he wanted.</p>
<p>I have to admit that the woman had a magnetic personality. You noticed her. She had a degree of refinement about her and even though she was brown skinned, she did not have large lips, a big nose etc&hellip; other physical characteristics that many other Black woman tend to have. She was indeed attractive. </p>
<p>They also had two little bi-racial girls with them. These girls looked to be I would say, 10 and 8. It was clear that these girls were their children. One looked like the father and the other had her mother&rsquo;s feature&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I can only imagine how many attractive White children he could have produced if he had been a race conscious White man. </p>

<p>The above comment borders on delusional.  Having evaluated and counseled criminals over many years, not to mentioned having lived in black communities, black males go to prison because they get caught committing crimes.  This is a preferred lifestyle for them. Being a violent criminal with lots of illegitimate babies is high status on the street. They have the emotional maturity level of a pre-adolescent, ages 8 to 12 years old, which also includes the extreme narcisissim that is standard with that age group.  Forget about black impulse control because it&rsquo;s nearly non-existent, and their complete rejection of education is but another primary cultural trait among most black males. </p>
<p>It will take more than 3 generations, at least, for the current black pathologies to get under some kind of control, but they would not be eliminated for at least 10. Black males know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing, and it&rsquo;s all by their choice.   </p>

		<p>Why do blacks need to work???  Myself and others posting here go to work every day and are taxed so these people can receive a check in the mail and have money deposited on to a card each month to buy food with.  &#8220;Failing schools and changing labor markets&#8221;?  Please.  All you have to do is go to youtube to watch them laugh and brag about the fact that they dont work because they know we&rsquo;re going to cater to them via welfare checks and food stamps.  Many of them make a business out of it.  Some of them will tell you thats the reason they have so many children.  More kids= more money.</p>

		<p>I have to say that if there is a trend toward white men pairing up with black women, as unwelcome as it may be, one enjoyable result will be the extreme consternation of the black male. The loud-mouthed clod who thinks he is the center of the universe does not like it when reality intrudes.  He will be mighty upset, to say the least, and it may move him to appreciate, for the first time,his own women. Of course we&rsquo;re talking about the black male here, so lets hope his angst doesn&rsquo;t result in the usual gunfire!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Even black men don&rsquo;t find black women desirable. I can&rsquo;t possibly think of a bigger insult or condemnation of black women then this.&#8221;</p>
<p>They deserve it.  Not all of them, but most of them.  Fat skinny it doesn&rsquo;t matter: many of them are bossy, rude, loud, mean-spirited, and obnoxious.  I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not a black man because I would feel trapped.<br>

		<p>I have to agree with other posters on the fact that many black women have the disposition of Klingons invading the Earth from outer space. I have also met black women who put most other women of all races to shame when it comes to being nice, well mannered and shall I day ladylike. This has to do with upbringing, and it&rsquo;s black women who have been deprived the most of this as a group. However this and the Klingon like attitude is not limited to black women alone, I have encounted a good many white women who have the disposition of a Klingon too.</p>

		<p>Mr. Banks, being a black man, is hardly suffering from &#8220;low self-esteem&#8221;. In his article, he rationalizes his highly inflated and delusional sense of his own (racial) desirability with ridiculous (but quite common among blacks) interpretations of the statistical data. </p>
<p>The reality is more like: </p>
<p>[1] In recent years, about 20% of black GROOMS took non-black brides. A VERY different statement than Mr. Banks makes, in which he replaces &#8220;grooms&#8221; with &#8220;men&#8221;   &mdash;   although, in all fairness, very few blacks, even college-educated ones, are remotely capable of understanding the ramifications of the difference (another statistic he will no doubt dispute).  </p>
<p>[2] A recent black bride is more than twice as likely to have married a white groom than a recent white bride is to have married a black groom. Mr. Banks needs to explain how that, and a few other statistics, are consistent with his grandiose opinion that women of all races are eager to find themselves a black man. </p>
<p>[3] In marriages where exactly one partner is black, the black  partner is about twice as likely be the man. But that has nothing to do with anything except the very low overall marriage rate for black women(and their correspondingly high illegitimacy rate, which of course affects their odds of getting married).</p>

		<p>People can tell all the anecdotes they want, but it&rsquo;s the facts that count, and the facts are that (as someone has already posted) the percentage of Whites, both men and women, marrying outside their race is in the single digits. That said, I don&rsquo;t think the people who are complaining about seeing white male/black female couples are &#8220;trolls&#8221; or deliberately trying to be deceitful. If something bothers you to a great degree, you&rsquo;re going to notice it and remember it every time it happens, and you&rsquo;ll end up sincerely thinking that the thing that bothers you is much more common than it is in reality. </p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t have a huge problem with white male/black female relationships. Do I think they&rsquo;re &#8220;cool&#8221; or &#8220;edgy&#8221; in any way? Absolutely not, but neither do I think that they&rsquo;re going to be the downfall of Western Civilization. At least the kids from those relationships will have a father that will discipline them. The much greater danger is in white female/black male relationships, which produce wild, undisciplined, fatherless mulattoes who never know their black fathers and carry a lifelong grudge against their hapless white mothers and White people in general. There&rsquo;s a reason that 95% of the interracial couples shoved down our throats by the controlled media are white female/black male. They KNOW that that particular pairing is the one that will do the most damage to our society.</p>

		<p>The question this article failed to answer was why so many black men marry outside their race. Did anyone here read that Michael Jordan is now marrying a white woman? And the black QB from Baylor who won the Heisman has a white girlfriend. I have lived in four cities and have seen very very few wm/bf couples, despite what others here have said. I also believe that some black men seek white women because they dislike white people, and degrading a white women is one way of showing their contempt for Whites. When whites, especially, white men, were being attacked in downtown Denver a few years ago, I remember reading in the Denver paper that one of those black thugs who was arrested told a reporter that he could not be charged with a hate crime, because the mother of his children was white. Say what? In other words he likes to beat white men for sport and fun and then go have sex with a white woman. I mean this punk obviously hates white people. I do not approve of wm/bf couples, but when it does happen I think the reasons are much different when it comes to bm/wf relationships. In these cases I just don&rsquo;t buy the &#8220;love is colorblind&#8221; logic.</p>

		<p>Number 37 makes a good point. In ancient times it was common of warriors from one tribe to capture, rape and impregnate women from another tribe. It was their &#8220;spoils of war&#8221;. It certainly didn&rsquo;t mean they &#8220;loved&#8221; the other tribe because they used their woman for sperm deposits. I suspect much the same thinking affects most black males today. There using white females for &#8216;booty calls&rsquo; is just another way to show their disdain and resentment of whites. It has nothing to do with being an expression of &#8220;love&#8221; or &#8220;admiration&#8221; for whites. </p>
<p>One other thing, despite what other posters have said, black male / white female is by far and away the most common inter-racial pairing I have ever seen. By far.</p>

		<p>Posters #37 and 38:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone here is saying there are no Black male/White female couples. Most people know that they are more numerous than White male/Black female couples. However, Wm/BF couples are becoming more commonplace and I have seen it myself. </p>
<p>As an example, a few weeks ago I was flying home visiting my certain family members early for the holidays. There was a handsome White male who looked to be late 20s/early 30s sitting two seats in back of me. When the plane landed, people stood up. That&rsquo;s how I saw him. He had a bouquet of roses with him. </p>
<p>Several people were having conversations with one another and he stated to tow people that the roses were for his wife. I smiled and did not think much of it. This is a fairly commonplace thing to do. </p>
<p>Once the plane unboarded, I walked as fast as I could to get to the baggage area. I just happened to see this same man with an attractive Black woman. She was holding the roses he bought for her. I was surprised to see this. I assumed his wife would be White.</p>
<p>I realize that this is just one example, but my relatives have mentioned to me that they are indeed seeing more White male/Black female couples. Moreover, when you do see these couples, they tend to be attractive and more upscale than Black male/White female couples. </p>

		<p>I agree with some of the other posters above.  There are two places in particular where I have seen an abundance of white men with black women. It was in Philadelphia as well as the coastal parts of Virginia that have a huge military population.  In Virginia I saw such pairings all the time much more so than the other type of pairing.  Also, in Virginia, the white men were always very attractive while their black female counterpart was overweight and repulsive.  The only explanation I could think of was that these GIs were trying out the local flavor as is what tends to be trendy with the military for whatever reason. The black women had to have been locals. The white men were always obviously military.</p>
