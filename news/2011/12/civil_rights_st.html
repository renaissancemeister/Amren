			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carla Rivera, Los Angeles Times, December 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A coalition of civil rights and student groups launched a statewide campaign Wednesday to support efforts to overturn California&rsquo;s Proposition 209, which prohibits public universities from considering race and gender in admissions decisions.</p>
<p>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments Feb. 13 in San Francisco from opponents who contend that the measure is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Although the law has been upheld by the California Supreme Court, opponents cite a July opinion by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which overturned a similar law in Michigan, as new ammunition for their cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an historic opportunity to repeal Prop. 209 if we can get the 9th Circuit to do the same as the 6th Circuit,&#8221; Leon Jenkins, president of the L.A. chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said at a news conference. &#8220;California has the most diverse population on the planet and that should be reflected in its schools and universities.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the numbers of black and Latino students admitted to the University of California plummeted after the initiative&rsquo;s passage, especially at its most competitive campuses. Critics say they remain too low.</p>

		<p>University admissions should be based on the best qualified student according to grades and testing.  Also, last time I looked we still have the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and that right should not be trumped by the so-called need for diversity. This country need the best qualified students.  Students who cannot make it into a university still have ample opportunities for a good education at lower level colleges.   I have trouble believing that it&rsquo;s unconstitutional when you don&rsquo;t get preferential treatment.</p>

<p>In other words, let&rsquo;s herd in the unwilling and uninterested just for the sake of a more &#8220;equal&#8221; student population.  </p>

		<p>The truth is is that it&rsquo;s Asians who dominate many campuses now.  They cannot even blame whites anymore.  </p>
<p>Funny thing is, there is constant push back from the Asians who mostly believe in merit.  It&rsquo;s kinda&rsquo; funny to see three non-white groups who basically pushed our kind out fighting amongst themselves in a failed state of their own making.  Sad thing is, in 20 years, it will be everywhere an there will be no more America as we know it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m one of those guys that like to make future predictions/trends (objective&hellip;meaning not what anyone, including Amren readers wants to hear)&hellip;</p>
<p>A diverse coalition WILL start to break down more and more after a primary opposition is removed. What unified them will no longer be there. Infighting will become more common.</p>
<p>This has be shown throughout history.</p>

		<p>As an FYI, Cal Berkeley and UCLA have more Asians than Whites enrolled.  The &#8220;minorities&#8221; are indignant that other minorities are outworking them and exposing them for what they are: low IQ leaches.  </p>
<p>Cal universities are already extremely &#8220;diverse,&#8221; they just don&rsquo;t have a sufficient number Blacks and third-world squatters to satisfy the parasites.  And ironically, the California universities still practice affirmative action  &mdash;  otherwise you may not even have enough Blacks stock their athletic programs.  They just don&rsquo;t do it overtly enough and in sufficient quantities to keep the parasites happy.  </p>

		<p>Yes, the law was repealed here in MI by a 3 judge panel but is still in effect until the next appeal.</p>
<p>As I ALWAYS say, whites should be asking for special treatment in areas where we would otherwise fail.  For instance, in the NBA, when a white player scores a basket it should count as 7 points just to even the odds.  The NBA needs more super-stars that look like me so my self esteem isn&rsquo;t damaged.  </p>
<p>In Olympic, college and even high school track and field events, black runners should have to wear small ankle weights or clown shoes to slow them down a bit.  </p>
<p>Sounds ridiculous but in a simple way, that most can understand, it drives home the point of how unfair affirmative action policies are.  <br>

		<p>When whites have become minorities in the US blacks and latinos will still fail to excel and will continue to blame whitey. Eventually the blame game will switch from blaming whitey to blaming tojo. Anti Asian sentiment will fill the rhetoric of the NAACP. There will be no end to it. They will never be satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;America as we know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>What an idea!  To illustrate the relativity of such an idea, let me remind the reader of how much things have changed since 1965.  There, I did it.</p>
<p>We are long departed from America as we knew it.  Some just imagine in their fantasy that their little lives represent some sort of American ideal.  No intention here to insult anyone, but some cold water on the subject is required IMHO.</p>

		<p>Go by the quota percentage of populas.  Sixty percent white, fourteen percent black, etc., see how they would squeal.</p>
<p>In TX whites are a minority and we expect nothing except higher taxes, more crime, and more whining.  White mans burden has to be those other folks.</p>
<p>I remember when CA made a statement excluding Asians from minority status, &#8220;they are too smart any way&#8221;, I was shocked enough to remember the quote all these years.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see why they bother.  Prop 209 had never been enforced, especially in goverment employment.  Prop 209 and all the rest of Ward Connerly&rsquo;s anti affirmative action propositions were structured that way.  Laws need built in enforcement.  Cal Justice Department in charge of enforcing civil rights laws just went on its merry facist anti White way.</p>
<p>No enforcement =  dead letter law.</p>
