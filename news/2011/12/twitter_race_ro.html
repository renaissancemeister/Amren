			<h1>
				Twitter Race Row as Dancing on Ice Judge Is Robbed at Knifepoint
			</h1>
			<p>
				John Bingham, Telegraph (London), November 15, 2011
			</p>
			<div class="lead">
				Whites must never mention that their attackers were black.
			</div>
			<p>
				Jason Gardiner, the choreographer and television fashion expert, was walking along Stockwell Road, south London, at about 7.30pm on Sunday when he was accosted by two youths wearing hooded tops.
			</p>
			<p>
				They held a knife to his throat, threatened to kill him and ordered him to hand over his mobile phone before making off, he has told police.
			</p>
			<p>
				The 40-year-old Australian, who is said to have been deeply shaken by the experience, posted a message on Twitter, where he has more than 83,000 followers, later in the evening explaining what had happened to him.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;Tonight I was mugged by two hooded black youths in Stockwell who held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill me, all for an iPhone,&#8221; he wrote.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few moments later he added: &#8220;Apart from being shaken I&rsquo;m fine! I&rsquo;m saddened more than anything and disgusted with where our society is heading.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				But his description was criticised by some. Lee McVeigh, 25, from Brighton, wrote: &#8220;Not really necessary to drop in the fact they were black &hellip;&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Mr Gardiner, who offers daily fashion advice on the ITV programme This Morning, was quickly drawn into the debate, tweeting: &#8220;Yes it is. It&rsquo;s not racist, it&rsquo;s a vital fact in case anyone can help and report them to the police.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				The explanation was ridiculed by some. Mr McVeigh wrote: &#8220;Everyone look out for two hooded black youths in Stockwell with an iPhone-not much of a description.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				But a string of others rushed to his defence. One wrote: &#8220;How can the race card be used when someone was mugged? Seriously!&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Vicky Entwistle, the Coronation Street actress, posted a message offering her sympathy: &#8220;Hope you are OK Darling, sending you a big hug,&#8221; she wrote.
			</p>
			<p>
				A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that police are investigating a robbery on a 40-year-old man on Stockwell Road on Sunday evening. No one has been arrested.
