For a society imbued with the egalitarian myth, it is unacceptable that important individual and group differences should have genetic origins. But even if family environment has little effect on individual traits, it can play a crucial role in instilling the values and expectations that determine the fortunes of&nbsp;<i>the group.</i>&nbsp;A child&rsquo;s abilities and personality are largely established at birth, but the focus of his most important loyalties appear to be formed within the family.

Generations of social scientists who put the emphasis on family environment are plain wrong. In fact, the failure to pay attention to genetic influences has resulted in the colossal misinterpretation of a century&rsquo;s worth of research.</p><table class="quoteleft" style="background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); margin-right: 1em; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em; float: left; width: 422px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><tbody><tr><th>The focus of a child&rsquo;s most important loyalties seems to be formed within the family.</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">It is easy to see where common observation might lead people astray. Bright parents, who spend time talking with their children, tend to have brighter children than do dumb parents who ignore their children. Crazy people who live chaotic lives tend to have children who grow up to be crazy. It seems obvious to all that the experiences of children in their families determine developmental outcomes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Nevertheless, Shakespeare, Darwin, and even the ancient Greeks knew that particular forms of insanity tended to be inherited and that intelligence was a family trait that is also sometimes inherited. Indeed, Sir Francis Galton, who was the first modern scientist to attempt precisely to gauge the importance of heredity versus family environment, worried that his findings might be disbelieved because they seemed to prove too much; he himself was surprised that family experience seemed to account for so little.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Galton&rsquo;s 19th century discoveries have largely been rejected by mainstream 20th century social and psychological science, but not because of better evidence. Rejection has been mainly for theoretical and ideological reasons. Liberalism abhors inequality, especially genetic inequality. It views inherited diversity as evil, and it did not take Hitler to make it so. The egalitarian movement antedated National Socialism; Hitler has just made it easier to demonize the truth. Ambitious social engineers hate genetic differences because they mean that social reform cannot remake mankind.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Once hereditary differences were ruled out, research could be done on the correlations of family traits with child outcomes, with the assurance that differences in family environments were always the cause. Many thousands of studies have been done, leading to one of the best-established generalizations of modern science: most traits tend to run in families.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Another well-established generalization is that individual differences tend to be stable across the lifespan. Mentally retarded adults were often developmentally disabled when children; timid children tend to become shy adults. This gave rise to one of the central tenets of environmental determinism and egalitarianism, namely that early experiences must be crucially important. Who has not heard that vital, formative experiences occur before age six? As intervention programs like Head Start continue to fail, the cutoff age for formative experience just gets pushed further back. Government social engineers start muttering that they could solve all of society&rsquo;s problems if only they could get their hands on your children before age two.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Debunking the Myths</b></p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">One of the first scientific studies of recent times to debunk the egalitarian myth was an investigation of schizophrenia, which is well known to run in families. Although the incidence in the general population is about one percent, the incidence among the children of schizophrenics is about 10 to 15 percent. Therefore, most children of schizophrenics   &mdash;   indeed about 90 percent of them   &mdash;   do not become schizophrenic, and most schizophrenics do not have a schizophrenic parent. Nevertheless, the incidence among children of schizophrenics is fully 10 to 15 times higher than in the general population.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Given that schizophrenia runs in families, literally thousands of studies were done to discover what rearing patterns caused it, and researchers found that family backgrounds of schizophrenics did tend to be different from those of normals. The environmental determinists came up with theories about &#8220;schizophrenogenic mothers,&#8221; inconsistent parents, and &#8220;icebox moms,&#8221; who caused schizophrenia in their children.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Of course, in most human families the parents provide both the rearing environment for children and the genes. Yet more studies of families could never have separated genes from experience as a cause of schizophrenia, because the source of the family environment is the same as the source of the genes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Len Heston, now at the University of Washington, finally cut through the fog in 1966. He tracked down adults who were the adopted-away children of schizophrenic mothers. Because these people were reared in normal family environments they should be normal   &mdash;   if family environment causes schizophrenia. In an amazing finding reminiscent of Galton&rsquo;s concern about seeming to prove too much, it turned out that the incidence of schizophrenia is exactly the same, however children are reared. Much additional research has verified Heston&rsquo;s discovery:<i>Schizophrenia</i>&nbsp;is a genetic condition. The best evidence at the present suggests that being reared by normal parents does not decrease the likelihood of developing schizophrenia, for someone with genes from a schizophrenic.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Contrary to a century of theory in abnormal psychology and psychiatry, there is little or no credible evidence that family environments cause any form of mental illness. Much research on bipolar affective disorder (manic-depression) suggests a similar conclusion: Broadcasting tycoon Ted Turner probably inherited his manic-depression from his suicidal father. Although he may have acquired &#8220;Hanoi&#8221; Jane Fonda from a flawed adult environment, gene-influenced bad judgment could also be a cause.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">The only way to disentangle genes from experience in assessing the causal role of the family is to make it possible for them to vary independently from each other. It is hard to design and carry out studies like this, so most social scientists don&rsquo;t bother. In the past, there was no reason to, because genetic influences were thought to be evil and could be ruled out in advance anyway.</p><table class="boxright" style="margin-left: 1em; float: right; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); font-size: medium; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1998/05/family.gif" height="128" width="190" align="right" alt="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Studies that separate genes from experience in family influences are mostly adoption and twin research. The modern spate of unwed mothers, broken homes and remarriages also provides material: Lots of families with both full- and half-siblings, who may or may not be raised by a common birth parent. Children with different degrees of relatedness who are reared in the same environment (by people who may not be their biological parents) offer a different angle from which to distinguish the effects of heredity from environment.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Even a single study, well conducted, can provide much information. However, with the power of computers and modern analytical techniques, the results of different studies with different designs can be combined. The data from multiple family types can be analyzed together   &mdash;   like solving simultaneous equations   &mdash;   to test theories that best explain real world data.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">When adoption studies were first done in the 1920s and 1930s, the results indicated that both genes and family environment contributed to individual differences in intelligence. These studies contributed to the &#8220;open minded&#8221; interpretation that both heredity and family environment are important. These early studies were limited, though, by the fact that they compared young adopted children with parents (biological and adoptive) who were already adults.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Further breakthroughs came only in the late 1970s, with the first studies of grown-up adopted children. After puberty, as a child begins to choose his own activities and associates, the correlations between child and adoptive (non-genetic) parent decrease to the point that they are not significantly different from zero. This finding is contrary to the environmentalist expectation of a cumulative effect of family environment. At the same time, as children grow up, the resemblance to the genetic parents who never reared them increases. Likewise, by the time they become adults, the correlations among adopted (non-related) siblings average around zero.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">These results hold for intelligence and for the &#8220;big five&#8221; indices of personality   &mdash;   extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, intellectual openness   &mdash;   as well as measures of mental illness. These findings from adults, that there is&nbsp;<i>no</i>&nbsp;family resemblance among adoptees that are not genetically related, leads to the eye-opening conclusion that&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;of the commonly observed similarities among family members on such traits are caused by shared genes,&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;shared family environments.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>What Use is the Family?</b></p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">These studies do not indicate that environment has no effect on intelligence and personality. They show only that the ways that families are different from each other   &mdash;   the differences social scientists thought were so important   &mdash;   have essentially no effect. For intelligence, which is the most intensively studied of all the mental characteristics, by the time people are adults, about 75 percent of the individual differences appear to be due to genetics, perhaps 10 percent may be due to measurement error, and the rest is presumably due to environmental factors&nbsp;<i>we</i>&nbsp;<i>don&rsquo;t understand.</i>&nbsp;Whatever those factors are, they are almost certainly&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;family income, social class, or education of the parents, that is to say, the characteristics on which liberalism pins its hopes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">The heritability of personality seems to be generally less than that of intelligence: About 50 percent of the variation among adults appears to be genetic. However, measures of personality are less reliable than measures of intelligence, which means that measurement error is greater. That puts a cap on the apparent importance of inheritance. However, as with intelligence, the environmental influence on personality does&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;seem to be related to the various ways in which families differ from each other. We don&rsquo;t know what it is, but we know what it is not.</p><table class="quoteleft" style="background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); margin-right: 1em; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em; float: left; width: 422px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><tbody><tr><th>Children develop their unique individuality in spite of, rather than because of, what we as parents do to them.</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">How can it be that families have so little effect on the development of children? One explanation is that for important traits, individual development is deeply ingrained, buffered from environmental perturbation, so that the genetic potential of the individual will develop almost regardless of the details of the rearing environment. This is the &#8220;cast iron theory of the mind.&#8221; Children develop their unique individuality into adulthood even in spite of, rather than because of, what we as parents do to them.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Throughout history and prehistory there have been many periods during which children have been reared amid the horrors of famine, war, pestilence, or predation. Studies of special cohorts in the modern era that have suffered from these misfortunes suggest that calamity has little effect on development of intelligence or personality. Today, the range of environmental differences found among families in modern societies is typically very small by comparison. The human psyche appears to resist damage or change. The other theory is the &#8220;spun-glass theory of the mind&#8221; that is favored by modern meddling liberalism. It holds that the human psyche is a delicate, fragile thing. Without a precisely optimal rearing environment it will fail to develop properly. Of course, prescriptions for what is optimal keep changing with the latest fads of progressive liberalism, but the bulk of the available evidence strongly supports the cast iron theory.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Galton, therefore, was generally correct. The environmental differences provided by different families have little effect on individual differences. However, this does not mean that different family environments are unimportant. The family, and its surrogates such as school, club, church, and state, are fundamentally important for human survival. They are necessary for the survival of the individual, the family&rsquo;s genes, and the family culture because they influence a child   &mdash;   and influence the group through the child   &mdash;   in ways that have not been thoroughly studied. If we draw an analogy between an infant and a computer, most (but not all) of the hardware and operating software is genetically determined. But much of the contents of many of the files   &mdash;   most of the numbers in the spreadsheets, for example   &mdash;   are written by environmental experiences, many of which are determined by the family.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Some of the same studies mentioned above that showed little influence of family environments on some things showed their fundamental importance for others. Whether or not teen-agers profess a belief in God is almost entirely a matter of shared family environment. So is denominational affiliation. Family environment almost alone seems to determine attitudes toward racial integration. The cultural standards you value are almost entirely determined by your family, or family surrogates such as the schools. The&nbsp;<i>contents</i>&nbsp;of the psyche, therefore, but not its style or capability are determined by family environment.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">It is not always certain, however, where personality ends and culture begins. It is clear that a child who is genetically destined to be intelligent and conscientious almost regardless of where or how he is reared is going to speak the language of the people around him. He will probably adopt their religion, preferences, and politics, too. Therefore, a child   &mdash;   bright or dumb, extroverted or not   &mdash;   if raised in a family that espouses modern liberalism&rsquo;s views of a progressive utopia, is almost certainly doomed never to experience a feeling of sublime pleasure from handling an engraved work of art that happens to be a side-by-side double-barreled shotgun of the supreme quality that is labeled a &#8220;Best Gun.&#8221; Of course, it is natural that people have differences of opinion; it is when the indoctrinated products of other families&rsquo; prejudices feel a moral compulsion to prevent me from exercising preferences they abhor   &mdash;   that is what is unacceptable.</p><table class="boxright" style="margin-left: 1em; float: right; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); font-size: medium; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1998/05/hunting.gif" height="200" width="190" align="right" alt="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Race destroyers like Morris Dees&rsquo; Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) certainly can have a profound influence on the cultures of families and the survival of their genes because of the propaganda they spread via family surrogates.

Our liberal masters are nevertheless determined to expand these programs rather than drop them. Why? Could it be that they understand the effectiveness of propaganda in shaping the contents and values of young minds even if the efficiency of those minds is not affected? As all totalitarians know, propagandizing the youth is a particularly effective way to modify the cultural values of a population.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">A very dramatic example of the effects of environment can be found in modern Japan. Today&rsquo;s Japanese are genetically no different from those of 50 years ago.

The Japanese still love their country but they no longer invade their neighbors or die in banzai charges.

Moreover, their culture is merely one   &mdash;   and a not very nice one   &mdash;   among a diversity of others.

		<p>Although the Holocaust tragically reduced the numbers of the most  accomplished racial group in the world by six million, survivors of the Nazi death camps quickly founded Israel. This tiny nation has survived despite daunting numerical odds and defeated efforts by the entire Arab world to destroy it.<br>
 <br>
Vietnamese children who were born during the War in Vietnam, and raised in refugee camps performed as well or better in school than more affluent whites when they came to the United States.<br>
 <br>
Nearly two generations since the civil rights legislation was signed, and since expensive government efforts have been made to bridge the racial gap, blacks in the United States continue to lag behind. The record of black countries in Africa since independence from the European empires has not been encouraging.<br>
 <br>
Because those who deny the importance of genes cannot explain these differences, they try to punish those who mention them.   </p>

		<p>Although the major media and those who formulate government policy have yet to acknowledge it, family environment does not determine intelligence or personality.</p>
<p><br>
I really hate when Amren does this.  Fields an article that attempts to deceive by discussing first a truth and then slipping in a lie in the hopes no one will notice.</p>
<p>Well, I notice.  IQ is largely genetic.  You can alter IQ by starving a child or smoking crack while you are pregnant.  Other than that, normal people have normal children, bright people have bright children and mental defectives have mentally defective children.  Blacks are almost all mentally defective to an extreme degree.  Note that the other two groups are rather malleable and tend to increase generationally. But that&rsquo;s a common sense issue almost completely ignored in psychometrics.</p>
<p>Personality however is not genetic.  Nor is it environmental.  However it can be altered by environment.  That&rsquo;s the bald faced lie in the article.  And indeed, one of the primary things that will drastically alter personality is a broken family.  This is a common sense issue.  Our society is filled to the brim with various attempts to understand and change the various problems caused by broken families.  This is especially toxic when children of these broken families, usually because of a lack of religious upbringing, which is shattered by the broken family, come into contact with blacks.  For their part, know full well what I am talking about and often groom, young white girls using the opportunity this presents to alter their personality.  From normal person to whore, using rape, drugs and other evil methods.</p>
<p>It is overwhelmingly important to guard the white family as a preserver of white personhood, virtue, goodness and civilization.  To practice radical separation from evil, blacks, marxism and shadowy groups determined to get their hooks in you and your children&hellip;..especially through drugs (which are a powerful tool for altering a person&rsquo;s personality toward evil).</p>
<p>Especially irksome is the discussion of &#8220;mental illness&#8221; in the article.  Mental illness itself is controversial.  And the term is mercurial.  A better term would be insanity.  Insanity is a general, popular term that is usually reserved for biologically based psychosis.  The article lies about the effect on environment by specifically leaving out the primary environmental cause of biologically based psychosis&hellip;.drug use.  Oh boy oh boy, but a stint working in community mental health, anywhere in the national will rapidly educate you about this issue.  There are a handful of people who have biologically based psychosis (schizophrenia, bipolar etc.) This runs in families and is genetic.</p>
<p>However, the VAST MAJORITY have a VERY CLEAR history of drug use.  Drug use activates their &#8220;mental illness&#8221;.  Cessation of drug use cures their mental illness.  A restart of drug use brings back the mental illness.  A reliable pattern with only one possible conclusion.  Drug use causes biologically based psychosis&hellip;.insanity.  No, not all&hellip;.but almost all.</p>
<p>For the &#8220;neurotic&#8221; mental illness&hellip;&hellip;depression, anxiety, eating disorders, there is a similar pattern.  However, these disorders are also very easily linked to behaviors in both how the person grew up and their current relationships, behaviors and thoughts.  Why is that important?  Because altering these things effects the mental illness.  However, the primary cause remains drug use.  Most with these diseases are actually drug addicts and often refuse to recognize the link.<br>

<p>Leftists define insanity as those who disagree with their policies - as did the old Soviets and those in the Eastern block. The added bonus to them is that they once again get to claim they&rsquo;re only making up for past injustices when mental illnesses was mislabeled, which you do in your post also. If mental illness is genetic explain how there is so much more of it now than there was only 50 years ago? and this isn&rsquo;t including the perversions and aberrations that are no longer even considered mental illness.</p>

		<p>Material claiming that families don&rsquo;t affect personality doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have the same definition of what &#8216;personality&rsquo; exactly means and is rarely even defined. Ask anyone to define &#8216;personality&rsquo; and many list attributes that others don&rsquo;t. Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong though. But it&rsquo;s just plain wrong, unconservative and irresponsible of AmRen to put down the family to make a point that can easily be made more constructively. On that matter, I&rsquo;m right 100%</p>

		<p>Racial genetics: necessary but not sufficient.  <br>
Historical generalisations may incorporate explanations, but are not always enough or even correct.<br>
You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear, but you have to make sure that the original and subsequent materials are correctly identified.</p>
<p>The cultural character - structure and tone - of a given population or nation is largely determined by its dominant elite, which can be displaced or changed by revolutionary action, especially through the impacts of warfare, entertainment, medical and communications technology: porn on the internet instead of prayer in the pews, so to speak.</p>
<p>As a family-relevant example, I quote from a UK &#8220;Social Crediter&#8221; review (Winter 2011) of Judith Weisman&rsquo;s &#8220;Sexual Sabotage&#8221;: &#8220;&hellip;factual material on the orchestration of the post World War II sexual revolution through corruption of research and education by the &#8216;sex industrial complex&rsquo; backed by high financial interests&hellip;[Normalisation of promiscuity, drug addiction and pop culture] far from being the result of a common desire for greater freedom from moral restraints&hellip;[was deliberately engineered] by vested interests through the media, legislation and educational establishments&#8221;, resulting in a statistically verifiable escalation of &#8220;rape, violence, child abuse, divorce, STDs, illegitimacy, teenage pregnancy and abortion&#8221;.</p>
<p>We are currently seeing a revived international push for the legalisation of &#8220;recreational&#8221; drugs which its leading &#8220;liberal&#8221; British sympathiser, &#8220;The Observer&#8221; (Sunday newspaper), recently admitted was driven by the lure of commercial profitability.</p>
<p>AmRen supporters could probably get together a similar documentation on the &#8220;academic&#8221; deconstruction of Dead White Male literature and art, and the &#8220;poliical&#8221; decomposition of Living White Male society and its significance.     <br>

		<p>The most ironic thing, (read: &#8220;hypocritical&#8221;), about the SPLC is that NOT ONE of its top executives is a minority.</p>
<p>In fact, despite being located LITERALLY in the back yard of Martin Luther King&rsquo;s home church, the SPLC has NEVER hired a person of color to a highly paid position of authority in its entire 40 year history.</p>

<p>Unbelievably, even the SPLC&rsquo;s &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; propaganda arm has been headed by &#8220;whites only&#8221; for 19 of its 20 year history.</p>

		<p>Although a good family can not guarantee the production of geniuses, children raised to adulthood by both biological parents living together in matrimony tend to do much better in life than children raised in &#8220;non traditional families,&#8221; even when other factors are held common. <br>
 <br>
The result of the sexual revolution has been to reduce the percentage of children raised to adulthood by both biological parents living together in matrimony. </p>

<p>I would argue the elite have already been displaced. What you&rsquo;re saying may have been true 200 years ago (and many of us may wish that what you are saying is true today) but everyone in America &#8216;knows&rsquo; the rich are corrupt and stealing from us. No one looks up to or tries to emulate the elite. It&rsquo;s all about being &#8216;hip&rsquo; and having &#8216;street cred&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s where the masses get their culture. </p>

		<p>Interesting.  My younger half-sister and I are polar opposites.  I was in accelerated classes; she in special ed.  I&rsquo;ve heard things to the effect that my (adopted) dad&rsquo;s family tree had some, well, nuts in it.  Where my birth father is Polish with some Russian, though, my sister&rsquo;s father, I&rsquo;m told, had some Amerind (though you wouldn&rsquo;t guess it because he was a blue-eyed blond and had primarily German ancestry), so my sister got it from her father and our mother.  She&rsquo;s a recovering alcoholic, and I&rsquo;ve never been drunk.</p>
<p>My son&rsquo;s personality is similar to his paternal uncle&rsquo;s  &mdash;  and to that of my husband&rsquo;s maternal uncle!  I tend to be something of a contrary person at times, and I see this in my son as well.</p>
<p>I do not see this as saying homosexuality is genetic, though.  If it were genetic, then why do you have cases of identical twins where one is gay and the other is straight?  Why is there an ex-gay group out there (Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays)?  That is more of a developmental issue, and lots of times it&rsquo;s due to an absent father and/or a domineering mother.  Their whole house of cards will come tumbling down once it&rsquo;s known that homosexuality is not genetic, but rather a behavior that CAN be changed.</p>
