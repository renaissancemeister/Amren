				Beatings Inside Detroit Middle School Bathroom, So Called 30-Second Game
			</h1>
			<p>
				Taryn Asher, My Fox Detroit, December 1, 2011
			</p>
			<div class="lead">
				Teenage girls regular beat each other in Detroit.
			</div>
			
				<p>
					A teenage girl is battered and beaten inside a Detroit school restroom while other girls watch and record the whole thing. However, this isn&rsquo;t the first time this girl has been assaulted at school. Her family says administrators know about the fighting and chose to look the other way.
				</p>
				<p>
					School is supposed to be about reading, writing and arithmetic, but inside the walls of Detroit&rsquo;s Ludington Middle School a bathroom has been used as a backdrop for brutal teenage brawls.
				</p>
				<p>
					It&rsquo;s a game called &#8220;30 Seconds,&#8221; but no one is playing. One eighth grader pummels another while a group of girls stand by egging it on-taping and timing it.
				</p>
				<p>
					{snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					Somehow 13-year-old Jasmine Crawley walked away with only broken glasses and a few scratches. She says she was pressured to fight, restlessly harassed for losing and now bullied for coming forward.
				</p>
				<p>
					{snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					Jasmine&rsquo;s family learned about what happened after her classmates posted the video on the internet. They immediately went to the school, which they claim brushed it off because Jasmine had done this before.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;Nobody got in trouble, not the people instigating, not the people that were fighting,&#8221; Arletha Newby told FOX 2.
				</p>
				<p>
					{snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					Late this evening we received a statement from a DPS spokeswoman. She said the school does plan to follow up and pursue disciplinary action.
