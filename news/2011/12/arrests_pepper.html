<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you thought the Black Friday shopping fights were crazy then just look what happened when a re-issue of shoes first worn 15 years ago by basketball legend Michael Jordan went on sale.</p>
<p>Madness was breaking out today at stores across the U.S. as impatient shoppers queued up to get their hands on the first new Nike retro Air Jordan shoes that went on sale for $180 this morning.</p>
<p>Police used pepper spray in Seattle, Washington; four people were arrested in Atlanta, Georgia; there were fights in Louisville, Kentucky, and unruly crowds forced two stores shut in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>Fights broke out in Charlotte, North Carolina; a gunshot was fired in Richmond, California; 1,500 turned up for 300 pairs of shoes in Indianapolis, Indiana; and a boy was injured in Troy, Michigan.</p>
<p>In Pineville, North Carolina, dozens of police officers had to break up fights and restore order inside Carolina Place Mall as early as 5am on Friday. </p>
<p>Outside the Foot Locker on the second floor, two could be seen throwing punches as they waited to get their hands on the Air Jordan XI Concord tennis shoe. </p>
<p>Witnesses said some shoppers started jumping the line, then a crowd of people at the back of the line forced their way to the front, causing several people to get angry and become unruly.</p>
<p>&#8216;People were falling, I had to jump over a girl, it was crazy,&rsquo; Dominique Brewer said.</p>
<p>&#8216;One kid was trampled and hurt his arm, maybe even broke it,&rsquo; a Troy Police spokesman told Patch, after shoppers had lined up at two Foot Locker stores from 4am for the highly-anticipated shoes.</p>
<p>He added that &#8216;shouting&rsquo; crowds outside both stores became &#8216;unruly&rsquo; and police had to escort some shoppers to their cars after they had bought the Nike Air Jordan XI Retro &#8216;Concord&rsquo; shoes.</p>
<p>&#8216;The crowd got a little out of control at both malls, and both malls had to call the police department,&rsquo; spokesman Andy Breidenich told Patch. &#8216;It was a strain on our resources.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Moving west to Seattle, police used pepper spray on around 20 people to break up fights among pushing and shoving customers waiting outside a mall to buy the shoes.</p>
<p>One man was arrested there for assault after police say he pushed an officer. Authorities said more than 1,000 people lined up to buy shoes at 4am at four stores, which all sold out quickly.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, four people were arrested in a mad dash by customers hoping to purchase a pair of the shoes and up to 20 squad cars responded.</p>
<p>Police said a large crowd broke down a door to get inside before a store opened. Authorities escorted most of the people back outside, but took four into custody.</p>
<p>Officers said they had to break a car window to get two toddlers out after a woman went in after the shoes. They said she was taken into custody when she returned to the car.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Indianapolis, 1,500 people were waiting for 300 pairs of shoes hours at Castleton Square Mall before they went on sale when police were called by security because of shoving.</p>
<p>Shoppers were throwing things at each other and officers, police told ABC affiliate WRTV. Authorities also had concerns that a glass window on the storefront could break because of the crowd pushing.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were trying to do what we could to make sure that once a person purchased the shoes and left that they were able to make it to their cars safely,&rsquo; an Indianapolis Police spokesman told WRTV.</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&rsquo;t remember anything like this in the recent past at all, definitely not with the iPhone or anything like that,&rsquo; another Indianapolis Police spokesman told ABC News.</p>
<p>The front doors of Lafayette Square Mall were broken off their hinges at 7am as shoppers ran inside and several people were knocked over in the mad rush, reported the Indianapolis Star.</p>
<p>&#8216;There was a few people who were on the ground,&rsquo; Jazmine Edwards told WRTV. &#8216;I jumped over them and kept running.&rsquo; The Nike shoes were first worn in 1996 when Jordan was with the Chicago Bulls.</p>
<p>&#8216;There were gloves, hats and pieces of clothing everywhere,&rsquo; Balint Nagy, 30, told the Indianapolis Star of the manic scene at the Lafayette Square Mall. &#8216;One guy lost both shoes and went in anyway.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Over in Charlotte, North Carolina, three malls reported unruly customers and dozens of police officers were called to restore order at Carolina Place Mall in Pineville after fights erupted.</p>
<p>The unrest started at 5am as a crowd of about 200 that had been waiting pushed inside. Women were seen throwing punches. There were also disturbances at SouthPark and Northlake malls. Police at both asked patrons to leave.</p>
<p>&#8216;People were falling,&rsquo; Dominique Brewer told NBC affiliate WAFF. &#8216;I had to jump over a girl, it was crazy.&rsquo; But Carolina Place Mall manager Susan Barwick still described the shoe sale as &#8216;successful&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The shoes named for Jordan are still generate huge sales years after the retirement of the NBA legend, who now owns the NBA&rsquo;s Charlotte Bobcats.</p>
<p>Two malls with Foot Locker stores in Austin, Texas, were shut down on Thursday night at around 10pm when shoppers began pushing each other and police called in backup to control the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8216;People started pushing like crazy and they started spraying mace on us for no reason,&rsquo; Jalen Hall told KVUE. &#8216;Nobody was doing anything bad.&rsquo; Police did not confirm the use of pepper spray there.</p>
<p>In Richmond, California, crowds waiting to buy the shoes at the Hilltop Mall were turned away after a gunshot rang out at 7am. No injuries were reported but a suspect, 24, was taken into custody.</p>
<p>There were also reports of Florida police using pepper spray. In Louisville, Kentucky, witnesses said police had to break up around 100 shoppers who were fighting over the shoes at Jefferson Mall.</p>
<p>&#8216;I got the love for the &#8220;Js&#8221;,&rsquo; Brandon Betts told Fox affiliate WRDB. &#8216;Look at the box. The box is cold. Man it&rsquo;s crazy in there: people getting run over and security guards getting trampled and stuff.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Typical black behaviour. No other race on this planet acts like this over a pair (or pairs?) of shoes. You can take blacks out of Africa, but you can&rsquo;t take the &#8216;African&rsquo; behaviour out of them. </p>

<p>Blacks have so few people of real accomplishment in their race that they have to engage in hero worship of someone who retired years ago after playing a children&rsquo;s game for a living.</p>
<p>Also, many blacks have little sense of honor, decency or decorum when waiting in line, which is why melees like this so often break out.</p>

		<p>Of course the popular media were typically vague in describing the rioters. One major news service disabled the &#8220;comments&#8221; section beneath the story. We can&rsquo;t have people discussing this sort of thing openly. That would be raaaaaaaaaaaaaacist!</p>

		<p>Now let us sit back and watch for stories in the next few months about &#8220;youths&#8221; being shot, stabbed or beaten to death for their cool new shoes. How ridiculous to act like wild animals over shoes for heavens sake. I have an eleven year old son, and I won&rsquo;t pay more than 30 bucks for a pair of sneakers, knowing he&rsquo;ll out grow them and have them torn apart in 3 months, much like his jeans will have holes in the knees and be an inch too short. But them again, I consider myself a sensible White person.</p>

		<p>The article makes no mention of the fact that 100% of the low IQ crazies battling over sneakers were black. In a country with a black population of just 13% I would think this is a significant cornerstone to the story. </p>
<p>I have to (or would like to) assume that most readers know the color of the perps. Yet, no one says a word.</p>
<p>This, in a way, marks the end of America. It took only 50 years to cripple a superpower - and it came from within. Can you imagine this in 1955? </p>
<p>Such is the behavior of barbarians. Of uncivilized people propped up and supported by the ongoing lies of a liberal left that unleashed this horror on the United States.</p>
<p>The tax dollars from those of us still working is now simply going directly to support, from cradle to grave, millions of violent, literally semi-retarded people who could not care at all if the nation collapses. </p>
<p>Worse, they take the money designed for basic necessities and use it to buy foreign-made shoes, and then riot, causing whites to spend untold sums more policing the mayhem and aftermath.</p>
<p>This is a shameful coda to the inane, suicidal legislation of the 1960s, and a statement on the cowardice of whites in the face of their own demise.  </p>

		<p>And this mayhem is only the start. How many shootings, stabbings and brawls will occur in the days and weeks to come as a result of somebody who got stuck in the back of the line being overcome with uncontrollable envy and deciding to jack someone for their beloved kicks?? </p>
<p>Then there are all the murders and beatings that are bound to occur when somebody accidentally steps on or brushes against one of these amazing shoes, scuffing the gleaming white leather, prompting the wearer to lash out with furious righteous violence.<br>

		<p>To our British brothers and sisters,<br>
Why in the world did you not heed the obvious warning that any casual observer of American history would have gotten, even tripped over?  That of course being the ugly world that we now find ourselves in over here with the increasing black problem. No real sense in reciting how ghastly our lives have become since we freed the blacks from, well, not slavery but societal norms. Shall we tally the wreckage left in the wake of black wilding or is it just too painful, the robberies, the rapes, the murders, the crushing burden of welfare? Before it is too late for you, before too many africans and muslims move to GB, save yourselves. It may be too late for the US or at least too late for us to wrestle with 65 million coloreds bent on destruction. And it is this all from the lesson of watching the mindless droves trampling one and another over what you call trainers, ones for 180usd none the less. And the lesson? What would these same creatures do if hungry or if their monthly welfare stipend were to end? </p>

		<p>Anytime, anywhere there will be large gatherings of blacks there should always be a large contingent of peace officers in place.  Why weren&rsquo;t they already there?  They need to be monitored like elementary school children or else they misbehave.  This would seem to be common knowledge by now but I guess that falls under that politically correct racial profiling nonsense.  Oh well at least we will continue to get these indisputable videos of them embarrassing themselves while the world watches and learns.   </p>

		<p>Just imagine, if you will, that this current economic crisis takes a turn for the worse.Imagine that food stamps become unaffordable due to IMF mandated cut-backs (this has happened to other nations in recent times), imagine a total dollar collapse, and Chinese purchasing power driving up the price of food, oil and other commodities sky-high.<br>
 Unthinkable?, well the economic events of the past 5 years tell us not.<br>

		<p>Despite being the poorest people in America, blacks think nothing of paying $180 for a pair of sneakers. If there are riots outside the stores which sell the shoes, it&rsquo;s no wonder that many businesses don&rsquo;t want to open stores in black neighborhoods. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe to wear the shoes anywhere, because the next thing we&rsquo;ll be hearing is that the owners are being beat up over them. </p>

		<p>What is interesting to me, in the first place, is the adulation given to a nonentity whose only accomplishment in life is an ability to throw a rubber ball around and leap into the air.  The fact that such creatures, descended from the Ubangi tribes (this is not meant as sarcasm; it is merely a correct anthropological observation) are seven feet tall and are able to put that rubber ball into a hoop that is not terribly high is hardly something for anyone to hold in high esteem.  To call someone like Mr Jordan &#8220;a great athlete&#8221; is to abuse the English language.  Yet in our &#8220;bread and circuses&#8221; country the ability to dance a ball around on some field somewhere is considered as a form of &#8220;greatness&#8221;, and a great marketing tool for corporate pirates like Nike, et al.  It is ludicrous.</p>
<p>This misguided admiration, coupled with a natural tendency among certain groups to act abominably at nearly any provocation, is a large part of what&rsquo;s behind this insanity to buy a pair of tennis shoes which, if nothing else, will stink to high heaven within about two weeks of them being worn.</p>
<p>Not only does this whole incident sicken me, but the whole aura of &#8220;professional&#8221; sports and the subsequent enthusing over the repulsive &#8220;athletes&#8221; who play in them also sickens me.</p>

		<p>A Dan Gable is a far greater athlete than a Michael Jordan.  And how about the time Alexander Medved did a saltou on 500 lb. Chris Talor in the 1972 Olympic games https://www.flowrestling.org/coverage/66-1972-Olympics/video/4389-Chris-Taylor-USA-vs-Alexander-Medved-USSR. Heavyweight wrestling matches can be slow, especially when one of them weighs 500 lbs., but this is worth the wait! </p>
<p>How about how Dan Gable walked all over his Russian and other opponents in the 1972 olympics. </p>
<p>If the basketball barbarians started taking a poke at those guys they would have suplexed them right on to their tiny little Afrikan heads, kind of like Asian guy Cung Le does to Mohammed Keita here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r55mxK2xKc!" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r55mxK2xKc!</a> Their tiny little brains would have been jarred. Poor Mohammed is getting tossed around like a rag-doll!</p>
<p>A panel of sports scientists once did a study of which athletes are the greatest all-round athletes in the world. Who won? The wrestlers and they are usually white!  </p>
<p>I doubt that Michael Jordan couldn&rsquo;t have ever hacked getting through a wrestling season. Getting tall on wellfare money and &#8220;affirmative&#8221; action donated by whites, like most black basketball players, is not the same as achieving greatness as an athlete. And how about that time that the all-pro Olympic team got trounced by all-white foreign ammateurs? Affirmative action in action!</p>

		<p>The reason why these shoes caused such a ruckus is not just because the American black has become zealously materialistic (as they think it makes them a little closer to the social status of Whites), but is because the rumor was started that these shoes allow you to outrun police.</p>
<p>Considering that manner on the police force are A) grossly overweight and B) black, the rumor has some merit.</p>
<p>We Whites shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised by this type of behavior over something as silly as footwear. Remember they are not capable of making any decisions, social, criminal, fiscal, educational etc etc that will ever truly impart to them any real semblance of civility.  </p>

 At the time I was stationed in the Bavarian Alps and my job often required me to be exposed to sub- zero temperatures for hours.<br>
 These made all the difference in the world to my comfort and safety and was the most intelligent decision about footwear the military had ever made up to the point in time.<br>
