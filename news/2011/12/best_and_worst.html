<h1><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-and-worst-run-states-in-america.html?l=1">Best and Worst Run States in America</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Douglas A. McIntyre et al., Yahoo!, December 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the second year, 24/7 Wall St. has reviewed data on financial health, standard of living and government services by state to determine how well each state is managed. Based on this data, 24/7 Wall St. ranked the 50 states from the best to worst run. The best-run state is Wyoming. The worst-run state is California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To determine how well  &mdash;  or how poorly  &mdash;  a state is run, 24/7 Wall St. weighed each state&rsquo;s financial health based on factors including credit score and debt. We also evaluated how a state uses its resources to provide its residents with high living standards, reviewing dimensions such as health insurance, employment rate, low crime and a good education. We considered hundreds of data sets and chose what we considered to be the 10 most important measurements of financial and government management.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
Best Run States: </p>
<p>1. Wyoming</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wyoming comes in first place in 24/7 Wall St.&rsquo;s Best Run States for the second year in a row. The state has high marks in many categories including high school graduation rate. A whopping 92.3% of state residents age 25 or older have at least a high school diploma  &mdash;  the highest rate in the country. The state also has the fourth lowest rate of violent crimes and the sixth lowest unemployment rate. {snip}</p>
<p>2. Nebraska</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Besides being financially sound, Nebraska also has an unemployment rate of 4.2%, the second lowest rate in the country. The state also has relatively low poverty, high graduation rates and the seventh lowest rate of foreclosures last month.</p>
<p>3. North Dakota</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>4. Minnesota</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minnesota moved up in the ranking from fifth to fourth due to its improvement in several categories, including violent crime rate and health insurance coverage. {snip} The state also continues to excel in the areas it did last year. Some 91.5% of the state&rsquo;s adult population has graduated high school  &mdash;  the second highest percentage in the country. {snip}</p>
<p>5. Iowa</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Iowa&rsquo;s greatest assets are its rates of educated and insured residents. Some 90.6% of residents 25 years and older have at least a high school diploma and only 9.3% of residents do not have health insurance. These are among the best rates in the country. {snip}</p>
<p>6. Utah</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The state has the fifth-lowest violent crime rate in the country, as well as the seventh-highest graduation rate in the country. {snip}</p>
<p>7. Vermont</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Residents are highly educated. It has the second lowest rate of violent crime in the country. {snip}</p>
<p>8. Virginia</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Virginia is the highest-ranked state in the southern U.S., largely because it does not suffer from many of the problems that plague the rest of the South. {snip} The state also has the sixth-lowest violent crime rate in the country, with just 213 incidents taking place in 2010 for every 100,000 people.</p>
<p>9. Kansas</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>10. South Dakota</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
Worst Run States:</p>
<p>50. California</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In the fiscal year 2009, the state spent $430 billion, roughly 14% of all the money spent by states in that year. Compared to its revenue, the state spent too much  &mdash;  California had the 10th lowest revenue per person, and spent the 15th most per person. California is the only state in the country to be rated A-, the lowest rating ever given to a state by S&P.; Despite the huge amount the state spends each year, conditions remain poor. California has the second-lowest percentage of adults with a high school diploma in the country, the second-highest foreclosure rate and is tied for the second highest unemployment rate in the U.S.</p>
<p>49. Illinois</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The state performs poorly in most categories, but is worst when it comes to its credit rating. Illinois has a credit rating of A+, the second worst given to any state, behind only California. {snip}</p>
<p>48. Michigan</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michigan has arguably suffered more than any state in post-industrial America. The state is one of just four with a credit rating of AA-, although its debt per capita is actually below average. The state ranks among the worst in the country for violent crime, unemployment, foreclosures and home price decline.</p>
<p>47. Arizona</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>46. Nevada</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>45. South Carolina</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Its state debt per capita is slightly below average. However, the state has the eighth highest poverty rate and the fourth highest unemployment rate. It also has the fifth highest rate of violent crime, with 597.7 crime committed per 100,000 people. This is actually an improvement from last year when the state&rsquo;s violent crime rate was 731 per 100,000  &mdash;  the worst in the country.</p>
<p>44. Kentucky</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The state saw slight improvements in the percentage of its population with high school diplomas and poverty rate. Violent crime dropped significantly  &mdash;  now the 10th-lowest rate in the country, compared to the 17th-lowest last year. {snip}</p>
<p>43. Rhode Island</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rhode Island has many positive attributes, including low violent crime rate and a relatively low poverty rate. However, the state&rsquo;s spending is exceptionally high, and it has accumulated $8,716 in debt per capita. Nearly 20% of expenditures are for public education, yet compared with other states it has the 10th lowest percentage of adults who have graduated from high school.</p>
<p>42. Louisiana</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Louisiana remains in our bottom 10 again this year, although it has improved since last year, primarily because of decreases in unemployment and violent crime rate. In all, however, the state ranks poorly in most of the metrics we considered. Louisiana has the fifth-highest poverty rate in the country, the 10th-highest percentage of residents without health insurance coverage and the fifth lowest percentage of adults with a high school diploma.</p>
<p>41. New Mexico</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} At 18.7%, the state has the second highest poverty rate in the country. Worst still, almost 20% of New Mexicans do not have health insurance. The state also has the highest rate of violent crime in the country.</p>

<p>The correct phrase is &#8220;worse still&#8221; and I would&rsquo;ve expected better from 24/7 wall street.  That may be true about New Mexico (the state which has the highest percentage of Hispanics/Latinos in the country) but keep in mind that the state with the highest murder rate (by far) is Louisiana at 11.25 homicides per 100,000 population. Maryland comes in a very distant second at about 7.45. New Mexico has the 5th worst murder rate.</p>

		<p>Great. So apparently, here is what the future of the US looks like:</p>
<p>• Instead of entire cities, such as Gary and Detroit, collapsing into ruin, entire states will collapse.<br>
• Instead of being divided into &#8220;red&#8221; and &#8220;blue&#8221; states, the country will be divided into &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;brown&#8221; states.<br>
•  More and more states will start to look like third-world countries.<br>
•  The liberals will continue to scream that &#8220;racism&#8221; is the cause of all these problems.<br>
• The majority of whites will continue to believe them.</p>

		<p>Take Detroit out of the equation and Michigan leaps into the top 20. No state can withstand a parasite of this magnitude leeching off of it. It&rsquo;s a zombie.

		<p>Often I see that California is called the future of America. What is happening to California now, with the whites losing their majority in a sea of colors, is what will happen to America. This is presented as a good thing. Those who cheer this development seem to think that the new minority-majority somehow will be as capable of wealth-creation and community-building as the whites where. Not only that, the minorities will be better, because they are not &#8220;racist&#8221;. </p>

		<p><b>The worst-run state is California.</b></p>
<p>I am not surprised.  California is a one-party state firmly in the hands of socialists, and, it&rsquo;s about to get a whole lot worse:</p>
<p>1.)  SACRAMENTO, Calif.-</p>
<p><i>Nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants could live and work openly in California with little or no fear of deportation under an initiative unveiled Friday by  state filpe fuentes and others.</i></p>
<p>The 0bama administration has already promised to support this.</p>
<p>2.)  In an imperious  <i>Open Letter to the People of California</i>, Gov. Brown writes about an initiative he is proposing (for &ldquo;public safety&rdquo; and &ldquo;education&rdquo;, no less):</p>
<p>–- Millionaires and high-income earners will pay up to 2% higher income taxes for five years. </p>
<p>  &mdash;  There will be a temporary ½ cent increase in the sales tax.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a temporary tax and it&rsquo;s not as if &ldquo;The Rich&rdquo; can&rsquo;t pack their bags and move elsewhere, to a state without individual state income taxes such as Nevada and Texas.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s California&rsquo;s stifling regulations, the nation&rsquo;s second-heaviest tax burden on businesses. draconian environmental policies and legislation that encourages frivolous lawsuits over minor violations.</p>
<p><i>The tax burden for a company to operate a business in California is 13 to 14 percent higher than the rest of the country</i> </p>
<p>California is on an unsustainable course.</p>
<p><i>The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.</i></p>

<p>Look at the racial breakdown. Duh.</p>
<p>Only two of the bottom 10 are Southern states, and they were dinged for ills associated with their high black populations. Their finances don&rsquo;t seem all that bad; but, having white-run governments helps in that regard. The fact that Southern whites vote in a bloc as Republicans helps keep black welfare breeding under control too, unlike in the North (just ask Wisconsin and Minnesota). Consequently, the black population is stable relative to the white, except perhaps in Florida and Georgia where they have blacks coming in from Haiti, Jamaica, New York, and so forth.</p>

		<p>It has everything to do with race, of course. The demographics of those well run states is predominately made up of white people. It baffles my mind that so many whites cannot or will not see the obvious. The more Mexicans and Latinos the United States lets in, the more the US will resemble Mexico and Latin America. The more Africans and Arabs we Europeans let in, the more Europe will resemble Africa and the Middle East. Why is this not clear as daylight?</p>
<p>It was no accident that America became the most powerful and prosperous nation on earth, while Mexico never evolved into much more than an upper third world country. The United States was created and built by north western Europeans. Mexico wasn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.  California was once the golden state, where everyone wanted to move to. Now it is financially and morally bankrupt. California is what America will be like in the future, if the population replacement is allowed to continue.<br>

Even if the majority of whites do wake up and don&rsquo;t blame racism for the problems of nonwhites, they&rsquo;ll be too afraid to say anything by then.  Has having a racist black president in office woke up the majority of whites?  Did that wake up white neocons who were recently fawning over Herman Cain and then calling the sexual harrassment charges against him by saying &#8216;liberals can&rsquo;t stand a strong conservative black man&rsquo;?  Unless Jared Taylor or James Edwards or Pat Buchanan or a white man of their character and strength get elected, we&rsquo;re screwed the say the least.  Sorry to be so dismal and pessimisitic, but I don&rsquo;t see many whites waking up.  If and when they do, it might be too late.  Think of the movie 300 where the few remaining Greeks had to be extremely militant and strong to take down enemies that greatly outnumbered them.</p>

I hope.you are not equating the low rate of violence to lax gun laws. How absurd. It is for one reason and one reason alone. It is almost all White! In Europe before they let the non-Whites in violence was even lower than Vermont and most of them allowed no guns. By the way this also exposes Rush Limbaugh for the fraud he is. He blames mis-managed states on Liberalism. Well what about Vermont, or Minnesota. Again it is because of race. I believe Rush is the most destructive and traitorous race traitor in the USA. When I see many people on this site who obviously follow this man, then and only then I think of joining a more socialist WN site/org lately though I believe I see former conservatives coming to their senses.<br>

<p>Because Vermont is virtually all white.  However, Gov. Peter Shumlin can&rsquo;t open VT&rsquo;s doors to Somalians fast enough.</p>
<p>If I were the Governor of a heavily black or Hispanic state, I would veto concarry, because I would want permit holders to get permits, so that laws against carrying w/o a permit can exist to be used as a technicality to get black and Hispanic thugs either to snitch on each other when they would not do so ordinarily, or to have a fallback crime for prosecutors to have to make plea deals with the same.</p>

		<p>  I am a Californian.  Yes, this state has many problems but you folks are missing a most obvious point. Overpopulation of any state leads to poor government. There are just too dang many people in California! Not too long from now it will be about 37 million!  Most of the states that are so well governed simply have FAR far fewer people!</p>

		<p>The correlation between % white population and &#8220;best run&#8221; ranking is a less than middling -0.42. The correlation between % black population and &#8220;best run&#8221; rank is a low 0.33. So there is a correlation between race and these rankings, but it&rsquo;s not very strong.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The population of North America consists to a large extent of Germanic elements, which have mixed very little with inferior people of color. Central and South America shows a different humanity and culture; here Latin immigrants mixed with the aborigines, sometimes on a large scale. This example alone allows a clear recognition of the effects of racial mixtures. Remaining racially pure the Germans of North America rose to be masters of their continent; they will remain masters as long as they do not defile their blood.&#8221;<br>

		<p>There must be something, however subtle, that is common to all those state with low crime rates.</p>
<p>This is a situation worthy of careful investigation and analysis, deserving of considerable federal resources to get at the root causes of this phenomenon. We must seek to duplicate these results throughout our nation, whatever the causes(s).</p>

		<p>California is the only state in the country to be rated A-, the lowest rating ever given to a state by S&P.;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
Illinois has a credit rating of A+, the second worst given to any state, behind only California. <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
OK, isn&rsquo;t there some problem with a rating system when A+ is considered a really bad grade?<br>
Or does the rating system not go from A to F, like one would assume, but instead of A  &mdash;  - to A+++ or something?</p>

		<p>That is funny - people often say &#8220;California is the future of America&#8221; and yet it is ranked at number 50! It just goes to show that indeed, USA is going down the toilet.</p>
<p>I have lived in central California  and before even reading the whole list I figured that California would be the last ranked.</p>
<p>Having been born in 1988, California has been bomarded by hordes of Mestizos and other non-Whites my whole life. The California my grandparents grew up in was polar opposite compared to present day. Back in 1950&rsquo;s California, the state was about 90 percent White, White cultural and spiritual values were still cherished and promoted (marriage is sacred, ancestry is a gift). There were no &#8216;gay parades&rsquo;, divorce and single-parenting almost unheard of, television didn&rsquo;t have filthy language, sexual innuendo, or violence.</p>
<p>The entire White world (European nations, Russia, NZ, Australia, Canada, USA)was MUCH better spiritually, mentally, emotionally, demographically, morally, and biologically before the onset of the &#8216;sexual revolution&rsquo; (sexual dehumanization), the civil rights movement (let&rsquo;s integrate the races against their will), and The women&rsquo;s &#8220;lib&#8221; movement (let&rsquo;s lie to women and say &#8220;childbearing is demeaning and limiting&#8221; and men are &#8220;holding you back&#8221;), along with the introduction of widespread birth control (White control)</p>
<p>Sheesh&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if White mankind can ever be restored. Too much brainwashing amongst our people over the last 45 years.</p>
