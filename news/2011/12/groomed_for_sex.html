			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Cooper, Daily Mail (London), December 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teenage student stabbed to death and dumped in a canal was groomed for sexual exploitation by adults from the age of 12, it has been revealed.</p>
<p>Laura Wilson, 17, had been tracked by social services since 2005 after she was identified as being &#8216;at risk&rsquo; of sexual exploitation by British Pakistani men.</p>
<p>But their work focused on other girls who were more closely associated with abusers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The white teenager was the victim of a cycle of sexual abuse and little was done to help her, Laura&rsquo;s family have claimed.</p>
<p>Rather than removing her from the situation, social services only carried out &#8216;preventative&rsquo; work to stop her falling into the clutches of abusers.</p>
<p>The student was murdered in October last year after bringing &#8216;shame&rsquo; on two Asian families.</p>
<p>She had a brief fling with married Ishaq Hussain, now 22, and became pregnant with his child while she was in a sexual relationship with Ashitaq Asghar.</p>
<p>A few days before she was murdered and dumped in the canal she had revealed to the two families that she had had affairs with both men.</p>
<p>After being informed of the relationship, Asghar&rsquo;s mother apparently hit Laura with a shoe. she said her son would never have a baby with a white girl and called Laura a &#8216;dirty white b****&rsquo;, and she should &#8216;keep her legs closed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The teenager had become pregnant just a month after she turned 16 and gave birth to Hussain&rsquo;s child in June last year.</p>
<p>Asghar pleaded guilty to murder in May, while yesterday a Sheffield Crown Court jury cleared 22-year-old Mr Hussain of Laura&rsquo;s murder after deliberating for nearly 11 hours.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC told the trial that Mr Hussain and Asghar mounted a &#8216;mission to kill&rsquo; Laura.</p>
<p>They adopted the language of the cult British film &#8216;Four Lions&rsquo;, a dark comedy about Islamic terrorists plotting an attack which was filmed in Sheffield and which they had both seen.</p>
<p>Asghar sent a series of texts to Mr Hussain using language from the film.</p>
<p>Asghar talked about buying a &#8216;shooter&rsquo; for £400 and he boasted about bringing his &#8216;hit list&rsquo; out. In fact, said Mr Campbell, the murder weapon of choice turned out to be a knife.</p>
<p>In one message, Asghar said to Hussain the day before she died which read: &#8216;I&rsquo;m gonna send that kaffir (non-Muslim) b**** straight to hell&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Campbell QC described Laura as &#8216;embracing life with gusto and she was an attractive and popular girl&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hussain told the jury he did not plot anything with Asghar and there was no plan to kill Laura.</p>
<p>Simon Csoka, representing Mr Hussain, said his client &#8216;was an unfaithful philanderer whose attitude to women absolutely stinks &hellip; but although he&rsquo;s guilty of many things, he&rsquo;s not guilty of murder&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board have carried out an investigation into Laura&rsquo;s death and the findings will be published in around a month.</p>
<p>Chairman Alan Hazell said more could have been done to help the teenager.</p>
<p>&#8216;Whilst not wishing to pre-empt that report, it is clear that Laura&rsquo;s situation was very complex, which made it difficult for agencies to engage with her. </p>
<p>&#8216;However, there were times when agencies may have worked differently or more effectively.</p>
<p>&#8216;All agencies which had links with Laura have taken part in the review and have already shown a strong commitment to learn any lessons the case has highlighted.</p>
<p>&#8216;This commitment has already been reflected in the work done to improve services for children and young people in the borough following challenge from the Government.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added that the case had been both &#8216;complex and tragic&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;This was a despicable crime in which a vulnerable young woman was viciously attacked and left for dead,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&#8216;It has left a young child without a mother and we hope that the earlier conviction which has been secured will help her family and friends as they continue to come to terms with what happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laura&rsquo;s links with Risky Business  &mdash;  the town&rsquo;s child exploitation project  &mdash;  Risky Business, and the fact that the relevant authorities knew she was having under-age sex with Pakistani men did not come up in the murder trial and has never been publicly acknowledged, the Time reported.</p>
<p>Earlier this year an investigation by the same newspaper triggered an assessment of street grooming. The Times uncovered a pattern of child-sex offending involving Pakistani men and girls aged 12 to 16.</p>

		<p>Other than her murder, is this any different from what we complain about in black families in the US?</p>
<p>A few questions: Where was her mother all of this time? </p>
<p>Her father? </p>
<p>Are her parents married?</p>
<p>Rather, the article focuses all responsibility for what happened and hope for preventing such incidents in the future upon government agencies and workers. That sounds an awful like the thinking of this black woman featured at AmRen yesterday: https://goo.gl/nYzUS </p>
<p>From the article: Asghar&rsquo;s mother &#8220;called Laura a &lsquo;dirty white b****&rsquo;, and she should &lsquo;keep her legs closed&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>That sounds an awful like what this black man said about black women in another article featured on AmRen yesterday: <br>
https://goo.gl/mN0M3 </p>
<p>Why do these young women choose to act like &#8220;white trash&#8221; rather than find a good guy to marry? </p>
<p>Funny how some AmReners think that without Biblical morality whites are immune from the various pathologies besetting blacks&hellip;.</p>
<p>BTW this is not a new problem, yet these young white women keep falling for it and their parent/s keep allowing it. How stupid can they be?</p>
<p>From The Sunday Times</p>
<p>September 30, 2007</p>
<p>Mothers of prevention</p>
<p>Schoolgirls in Lancashire and Yorkshire are falling prey to sinister gangs of pimps. Two men have been sent to jail, but the girls&rsquo; mothers, not the police, are at the forefront of the crackdown. Why are the authorities so reluctant to get involved?</p>
<p>Investigation by Julie Bindel</p>
<p>At the crown court in Preston on August 10, a trial involving two Asian men caused unusual interest across a number of cities in the north of England. The defendants, Zulfqar Hussain and Qaiser Naveed, were each sentenced to five years and eight months for abduction, sexual activity with a child, and the supply of a controlled drug.</p>
<p>They had both pleaded guilty, and they were placed on the sex offenders&rsquo; register for life.</p>
<p>It seemed a shabby, seedy episode, probably typical of many cases down the years that have involved exploitative men and naive women. Yet, until these convictions, the police in over a dozen towns and cities, including Leeds, Sheffield, Blackburn and Huddersfield, had appeared reluctant to address what many local people had perceived as a growing problem – the groups of men who had been preying on young, vulnerable girls and ensnaring them into prostitution.</p>
<p>It was a very uncomfortable scenario, not least because many of these crimes had an identifiable racial element: the gangs were Asian and the girls were white. The authorities, in the shape of politicians and the police, seemed reluctant to acknowledge this aspect of the crimes; it has been left to the mothers of the victims to speak out.(/quote)</p>

<p>But if you&rsquo;re a white woman with your infant children on a subway, and you start yelling &#8220;racist rants,&#8221; the social services politburo will legally kidnap your kids.  It&rsquo;s time to free Emma West.</p>

		<p>We have become too decent to survive the plundering of alien cultures with their violent, exploitative, ways.</p>
<p>At one time this type of primitivism would have been dealt with by the parents and community by shaming the girl into realizing what she was about to lose.</p>
<p>And by officialdom by making the entire Pakistani Community realize their presence on British Shores was only that of &#8216;permanent temporary&rsquo; guests.</p>
<p>Now, the dramatic percentage rise in South West Asians and the deliberate nature of the desired social engineering _not economic_ change that is being aspired to by the English Elite is creatinga situation where there is no reserved territory, no unchallenged native stronghold, for Real English to find sanctuary in.</p>
<p>And so unless you can do what the ex-Nazi German communities did in Argentina and the like (literally building walled and gated compounds in the heart of the natives), England will vanish as a homeland of our folkway and genelines.</p>
<p>In the end, I can only say, that I hope the real &#8216;lessons learned&rsquo; here are those held by other parents who save up every newspaper article and autopsy photo they can get their hands on and hold them up to their daughters with a fury of &#8220;This is what the Pakistani community thinks of those they &#8216;groom&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because our children are still our responsibility.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to grasp this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grooming&#8221; has become so common in England while the police and especially the parents are unable (or unwilling) to do anything about it.</p>
<p>These Middle Easterners must be laughing themselves hysterical over the inability of whites to protect their women or even stand up to the non-white invasion.</p>
<p>To really realize how horrible this is, imagine if the races were reversed&hellip;what if a small group of white men were grooming middle eastern women for sex in some middle eastern country?  </p>
<p>These white men would not last one week before they were all slaughtered and strung up on lamp posts.  It wouldn&rsquo;t even be a police matter; the civilian men would handle it.</p>

		<p>I feel like crying I am so helpless. Brits know their once-proud culture and country is gone with the wind, but as a people they seem quite willing to watch the train wreck.  From this side of the pond, their government appears almost giddy at times to see the blacks and browns ruin them.  </p>
<p>At other times (such as the in the aftermath of the widespread rioting this year) their government officials look like deer caught in the headlights.  &#8220;How did this happen?  I know   &mdash;   clearly we are not diverse enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>Deer who will not do the things necessary to prevent their herd&rsquo;s demise, sadly.  And fine, if that is what they want.  Though my genes come from that sceptered isle and I take an immense pleasure in reading Shakespeare and Tennyson and in considering the dash and elan of men like Henry V, the UK has the right to commit cultural suicide.</p>
<p>What really really sucks is that America is falling headlong down the same well.  With the same deerlike foundering.</p>
<p>And our Blacks are more mean and far more evil.</p>

		<p>Forget about the girl&rsquo;s mother, where was the FATHER? Obviously, the mother was a useless moron, but where are the FATHERS? Have they given up in this age of feminism? My father would have shipped me off to a convent somewhere out of country!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a woman myself, but this weepy, &#8220;compassionate,&#8221; love the world, man-hating feminism is killing us. This story is absolutely disgusting.     </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve written before, the Pakistanis are very careful to keep their own women pure and virginal for marriage whilst using this young White trollops as prostitutes.</p>
<p>With the general breakdown of social mores due to bad politics, the acceptance of massive uncontrolled third world immigration on to a people that never wanted or needed them is not the only symptom. The rise of &#8216;feminism&rsquo; and &#8216;women&rsquo;s&rsquo; rights&rsquo; have ensured that the fathers, uncles, brothers etc of these silly White girls who once would have exercised some control and respect over them have largely been neutered by political/legal establishment that privileges women and &#8216;castrates&rsquo; men.</p>
<p>If the girl&rsquo;s father wasn&rsquo;t absent due to &#8216;easy&rsquo; divorce laws or if her mother never even bothered to marry in the first place I would be surprised.</p>
<p>Add this to the fact that modern left wing political parties define themselves as female/darkie anti-White male political alliances and have taken concerted action to legally marginalise and denigrate White males.</p>
<p>Now with White men &#8216;no longer necessary&rsquo; we get  a raw, elemental struggle. The Pakistanis, who never fell for this guff in the first place, are an intelligent people - more intelligent than whites, in fact, despite what the &#8216;IQ&rsquo; brayers try to tell you. With an eye to the main chance, being the devious cunning instinctive predators they are, they can see an open target (the modern west&rsquo;s mucked-up politics, morals and society), and exploit it to the hilt.Rather like tigers stalking tethered goats.</p>

		<p>So tragic.  All these girls who grow up without a father - easy prey for evil men who see white girls as less than human, more like sexual cattle.  Their mothers are clueless and a mess.  The daughters pay the price.  This is eating away at the edges of &#8216;our&rsquo; community and our future is being culled one runaway at a time.</p>

		<p>These men are going after 12 year old girls. It&rsquo;s surprising that they&rsquo;re finding so many whose parents haven&rsquo;t warned them to stay away from strange men. The social services already knew back in 2005 that these men were going after children, and that there were other children in even more danger than Laura. Why weren&rsquo;t they picked up then? They should have either been locked up or sent back to Pakistan.</p>

		<p><i>At one time this type of primitivism would have been dealt with by the parents and community by shaming the girl into realizing what she was about to lose.</i></p>
<p>At one time, those Pakistani men would have been quickly hanged from the nearest gallows until dead.</p>
<p>At one time, those Pakistanis would NOT have been allowed to settle in England because at one time the British government upheld laws that justifiably protected Native Born British citizens in their own homeland, not foreigners.</p>
<p><i>These Middle Easterners must be laughing themselves hysterical over the inability of whites to protect their women or even stand up to the non-white invasion.</i></p>
<p>Even worse, they are laughing that the British government effectively looks the other way while they rape the children of their host population:  Native Born White Britons.</p>
<p>This must be the end of civilization, when children are raped.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><i>Asghar said to Hussain the day before she died which read: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna send that kaffir (non-Muslim) b**** straight to hell&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>No hate speech charges as there were for Emma West who was arrested and had her children taken away by the British police state for expressing her (correct) opinion?  AND, under a Conservative government, no less?</p>
<p>Yes, it is the end of civilization   &mdash;     for the Native Born White British, that is, the ones who have been in Britain for 40,000 years.</p>

		<p>The old Biblical admonition to train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it is as true today as the day it was written. Parents especially fathers must stay involved with their children. The parents in this case have blood on their hands.</p>
<p>White parents must be aware that the public school systems throughout the Western world have been on a campaign for the last thirty five years of erasing all traces of White identity. Your children are being taught that Thomas Jefferson or George Washington could have just as easily been sub-Saharan Africans. Thus, as they reach their teenage years all vestiges of racial awareness have been removed. They are left with no identity of who they are as a White person and how they differ from other people in the world. Because of this and through the reinforcement of the entertainment media they become vulnerable to the criminals now residing among us.</p>
<p>Be forewarned by stories such as this one.</p>

		<p>I live near a hostel for bogus asylum seekers in Liverpool &amp; have watched in horror as groups of middle Eastern lads harass local girls without censure. Local lads are warned off by the PC police &amp; adults who complain are accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo;. Children as young as 12 are offered cigarettes, money &amp; drugs. We have lost our borders nationally &amp; morally. See my talk mspoliticalguy on Youtube.</p>

<p>Watch this carefully. The guy makes an important point. It is called Karma. You had it coming. You don&rsquo;t take care of what you have, you won&rsquo;t have it. You have vilified, maligned, criminalized, the people who stood up for the white race. What do you expect? That the colored of every stripe will appreciate you?

		<p>No.13 requires a retort. The Nazis did not stand up for the white race! They stood up for German tyranny. They may have brought great suffering on their people, but they started the mass murder. In 1939 they bombed Warsaw, in 1940 they bombed Rotterdam, in 1941 it was Belgrade. The Russian people initially welcomed the Wehrmacht until they ruthlessly killed numerous civilians. Nazism was a curse on the white race &amp; should be left in the rubbish bin of history. Whites must unite now &amp; leave are past divisions behind IF we are to have a future.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to dig deeper into the mainstream propaganda that was aimed to destroy any White race cohesiveness&hellip;&hellip;A clue. Look at what has happened to our race AFTER WWl and WWll. It wasn&rsquo;t the nazis or Hitler that did this. The bolsheviks were the curse on the White race and especially White Christians. They murdered millions of Whites</p>

		<p>There is a point to be made about &#8220;karma&#8221; here: the British did, after all throw their countrymen to the wolves in Rhodesia, and did call for an end to apartheid in SA. Now they are experiencing all the joys of third world peoples and multicult life that they foisted upon whites in southern Africa. </p>

		<p>I have just had a good look at the link provided by #13. The standard of blog, debate, obscene language, grammar is somewhere beyond woeful!</p>
<p>But &#8220;Karma:, as you mentioned in your post suggests we had it coming, yes an interesting point:</p>
<p>1, Re The young teenage women in these situations, sadly they are stupid young women who look for and attract trouble. They are often made-up and dressed-up and have a general attitude beyond their years.<br>
So then, when you have &#8220;Middle Eastern&#8221; youths on the prowl they have 2 choices, (i) Meet up with a young lady of Middle Eastern appearance who will be wearing medieval robes with a burqua and genarally be kept under lock &amp; key by her parents until such time as they (her parents) can arrange the the correct match for her. Or (ii) Pick up one of the many white teenage girls who just seem to want to make eyes at these guys. Many of these guys here have very fancy cars and seemingly unlimited cash which adds to there general attractiveness for casual relationships.</p>
<p>2, A generation or so ago it was unthinkable for any young lady to hang about a hotel bar or party till 3am at a nightclub or even drink alcohol. Now it seems to be the norm, again this can only invite trouble from Middle Eastern sex prowlers.(Not to mention Somali Rapists)</p>
<p>As parents we have a duty to &#8220;Teach or children well&#8221; and look at the society we are part of and where it is heading.</p>
<p>Then there is another aspect, we enjoy a beach culture here in Sydney, young ladies wear brief swimsuits, nothing wrong with that. But when Lebs, Pakistanis and Somalis etc see this  they can not seem to control their emotions/actions, this was one of the causes of the recent Cronulla (beach) Riot.(Hardly ever a Muslim in sight at Cronulla beach these days!)</p>
<p>As well as taking advantage of our Welfare System, many of these 3rd world immigrants (invaders) just take a totally wrong advantage of our social customs and norms.</p>
<p>Muslims, Somalis, Sub-Saharan Africans etc will never really become part of our society here in Australia or Canada, UK, USA, most of them don&rsquo;t even want to. Better still we should not be encouraging them to come here in the first place.</p>

		<p>I think people have to bare-in-mind that White men WOULD be standing up for our women, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the Law. Everyone here can see that if a white guy punches a non-white its a Hate Crime. But its a &#8220;cultural misunderstanding&#8221; if Paki&rsquo;s rape and molest white kids. </p>
<p>These laws are protecting non-whites, and will do so until whites finally engage in all out war. The problem with our people is, every other group considers themselves a group. We consider ourselves individuals and question the motives of other whites. In all likelihood, if a white guy stood up to a non-white, white libs would attack the white guy.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so predictable that when Asian is used to describe a perpetrator of a violent crime they are never Asian.  It is always a Pakistani or Indian.  </p>
<p>Of course, they are using the term Asian in the geographical sense, but no one would describe an American criminal as a &#8220;North American&#8221;.  The British are even sillier than us when is comes to dancing around race.<br>

<p>The parents are in fact not allowed to protect their children, because preventing them from going out and associating with these pakis would be considered &#8220;kidnapping&#8221; or otherwise holding them.</p>

You should review your WW2 history. Hitler/nazi&rsquo;s was not the one killing millions of civilians, neither did they want war, except of course to destroy bolshevism which was diabolical evil.</p>
