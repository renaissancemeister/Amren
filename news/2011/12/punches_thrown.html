			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lydia Warren, Daily Mail (London), December 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like a good bit of competitiveness to get a sports team pumped up.</p>
<p>But Xavier and Cincinnati basketball players took the sentiment a little far during their Saturday game, which ended in a mass brawl, slashed faces  &mdash;  and potential match bans.</p>
<p>Xavier beat Cincinnati 76-53 in the game that featured a steady exchange of venomous words  &mdash;  the latest altercation in a crosstown rivalry spanning decades.</p>
<p>There were just 9.4 seconds left on the clock when a few shoves between players sparked the all-out brawl.</p>
<p>Players jumped from the benches to square up with their rivals.</p>
<p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s Yancy Gates threw a punch at Xavier centre Kenny Frease, splitting his left cheek. Knocked to the ground, Frease was then kicked by Cincinnati&rsquo;s Cheikh Mbodj.</p>
<p>Coaches from both teams tried to yank their players out of the fight.</p>
<p>Suspensions are expected after videotapes of the match are reviewed by athletic bodies the Atlantic 10 and the Big East.</p>
<p>A few hours after the game, the Atlantic 10 announced Gates, Mbodj and Wells were listed as ejected, indicating their actions were deemed the most severe.</p>
<p>&#8216;There&rsquo;s no excuse for any of them, on our side, on their side,&rsquo; Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin told the Associated Press. &#8216;Guys need to grow up.</p>
<p>&#8216;There is zero excuse for that in basketball. You&rsquo;ve got to learn how to win on one side, you&rsquo;ve got to learn how to lose on the other side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brawl was the culmination of jibes exchanged as teams passed each other on court throughout the match.</p>
<p>Xavier&rsquo;s Mark Lyons and Tu Holloway had yelled at Cincinnati players, igniting the free-for-all.</p>
<p>Holloway, the Atlantic 10&rsquo;s player of the year, said the fight started after his teammates felt disrespected.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was just saying it&rsquo;s my city right here,&rsquo; Holloway said. &#8216;I&rsquo;m cut from a different cloth. None of them guys on that team is like me.</p>
<p>&#8216;I felt disrespected for them guys to come at me and talk like that, so I let the whole staff over there and let their players know that none of them is like me. That&rsquo;s when it started.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Both coaches expressed disappointment at how the players had behaved. They said they were unsure which of their players would be suspended.</p>
<p>&#8216;It was such a melee,&rsquo; Xavier coach Chris Mack told AP. &#8216;We were just trying to separate players and it becomes chaotic in there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s disappointing. We&rsquo;re all competitors. We all played our hearts out. This game means so much. There&rsquo;s a lot of pressure on both teams to win it. For it to play itself out like it did at the end, I don&rsquo;t know another word other than disappointing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s coach Cronin told his players to remove their jerseys after the game as they were a poor representation of their school.</p>
<p>University of Cincinnati President Gregory H. Williams issued a statement agreeing he was &#8216;extremely disappointed&rsquo; with their conduct.</p>
<p>&#8216;I appreciate Coach Cronin&rsquo;s strong postgame comments, and I want to support his position that this behaviour is not what we expect of representatives of the University of Cincinnati,&rsquo; Williams said.</p>
<p>&#8216;We will thoroughly investigate this incident and will act swiftly and firmly. We hold our student-athletes to a high standard, and this behaviour will not be tolerated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Xavier President Rev. Michael J. Graham said in a statement: &#8216;This behavior was not representative of Xavier&rsquo;s standards and has no place in intercollegiate athletics.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rivalry between the two Cincinnati-based teams has spanned decades.</p>
<p>In 1994, after a Xavier win, Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins refused to shake Xavier coach Pete Gillen&rsquo;s hand. Gillen called Huggins a &#8216;cheater&rsquo;, with Huggins responding that Gillen was a &#8216;phony&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In 1967,  Xavier&rsquo;s Joe Pangrazio grabbed a crutch from a fan in the stands and threw it at Cincinnati&rsquo;s Raleigh Wynn. Both players were ejected as fans hurled debris onto the court.</p>
<p>Holloway added it was not the first time the crosstown rivals had exchanged venomous words.</p>
<p>&#8216;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to see from Xavier and Cincinnati,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;We got disrespected a little bit before the game, guys calling us out.</p>
<p>&#8216;We&rsquo;re a tougher team. We&rsquo;re grown men over here. We&rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of gangsters in the locker room  &mdash;  not thugs, but tough guys on the court. And we went out there and zipped them up at the end of the game.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I go to UC, and can tell you personally there is no force quite as disruptive as the &#8220;student athlete.&#8221; They gather in the halls between classes (and sometimes during) obstructing walking traffic both ways.</p>
<p>And yet, the reason we must endure them (and the reason they are elevated in our society) has less to do with them and more to do with the fans. The fans create this climate by paying exorbitant ticket prices (and in the case of pro athletes, making concessions when the spoiled players make demands). </p>
<p>The fans are what made something like the Paterno-Sandusky scandal possible. We the people will turn a blind eye to every kind of pathology from the players, from rough-housing to rape, in order to sate our appetite for bread and circuses. White working class men pay for the opulent lifestyles of black thugs who torture pitbulls in the basements of their mansions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no hippy, but I believe it was Timothy Leary who said <br>
&#8220;Turn on, tune in, drop out&#8221; or something to that effect. How about we all just tune-out? Stop watching, stop paying to go to the games. Take the spectator out of the sports and use them to get some exercise instead, or to bond with your friends or your children. This is getting ridiculous.</p>

		<p>Assuming these &#8220;college boys&#8221; are of actual college age, just what the hell gives them the right to feel &#8220;disrespected&#8221;, a term I have grown to despise? It simply means some ethnics are unable to control their impulses and resort to physical violence rather than displaying some true dignity, maturity and humility by ignoring provocation. When I was a 19-20 year old, I hadn&rsquo;t lived long enough to even deserve being &#8220;disrespected&#8221;. These brutes just look for any excuse to be&hellip;..brutes. The new caveat also holds true, no attendance ANYWHERE where blacks comprise over 20% of the<br>
immediate surroundings. This may even be too high.</p>

		<p>These thugs wouldn&rsquo;t be taking up classroom space and given celebrity status if Whites didn&rsquo;t cheer for them. </p>
<p>Whites who cheer or support college sports are the problem. White fans, YOU are a disgrace. Take your need for amusement and channel it into something that doesn&rsquo;t glorify ghetto criminals.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was just saying it&rsquo;s my city right here.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just saying this is one of the reasons it&rsquo;s not my city anymore.  I moved outside Cincinnati as soon as the political results became apparent from the 2001 riots, where a black mobocracy was given legitimacy and awarded the keys to the city.</p>
<p>These black people disrespected me and all decent white citizens of that once-respectable, quaintly conservative town.</p>
<p>Btw, this incident demonstrates why white people should have zero interest in bassetball; a sport better suited to darkest Africa.</p>

		<p>     When something like this happens in a basketball game, it is almost always a failure of coaching.  </p>
<p>     First, the final score suggests that the Xavier coach let his team run up the score.  76-53 is an intended humiliation.  When you are ahead by 15, and time is running out, you put your defensive players on the court, concede the offensive boards, and sit back and wait for the final buzzer.  The Xavier staff should easily have seen this coming.</p>
<p>     Second, both benches did not clear, as the announcer claimed.  The Cincinnati bench cleared, and mobbed the Xavier five on the court, who were right in front of them.  When the Xavier bench finally trotted over to the action, the action was over.</p>
<p>     Third, kicking someone in the head while they are down is so black.  All the flash mobs with any self respect do it.  After all, a well placed kick to the head can turn someone into a vegetable, for life even!  </p>
<p>     Fourth, someone tell me the difference between a gangster [gangsta, really] and a thug, a distinction of apparent great importance to Atlantic 10 Player of the Year Tu Holloway.  If Xavier had any class, it would toss Holloway off the team, for starters, and then fire the head coach. </p>

		<p>What needs to happen is for the police to walk out there and start putting these idiots in handcuffs.  Never have understood why it is okay for two guys to go at it in a sporting event (other than boxing, of course) but if you and I were to do the same, we&rsquo;d be locked up.</p>

<p>Does the player get respect now? Yes, in his own community and peer group the player probably gets more respect. In the rest of the US, the player loses respect. </p>

		<p>I am from the area and this incident is the talk of the town. Gates, who is black, appears to have targeted and sucker punched one player. That player was Ken Frease, the only White player in sight. </p>
<p>On talk radio today this story dominated. I listened all day to 700 WLW, and I only heard ONE caller bring up the possibility that this was a racist incident. The host, Tracey Jones, a former MLB player, quickly dismissed any possibility that there was a racist intent by Gates. But look at the video. There are plenty of opportunities for Gates to punch the black players on the Xavier team and he declines. But he didnt decline his opportunity to sucker punch a White player who wasn&rsquo;t looking in the direction the cowardly Gates threw his punch. </p>
<p>The only good thing I heard all day, was that Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters announced he may seek criminal charges against Gates and possibly others. I urge everyone to call Deters and leave a message demanding that criminal charges be brought against Gates. At least assault charges and hopefully hate crimes charges as well. Joe Deters, Hamilton County prosecutor, (513) 946-3000 </p>

		<p>I actually watched some of this game the other day on ESPN. I don&rsquo;t h&ve; alot  of kind words for this network, but it&rsquo;s alot like a monopoly. Where else can one get their sports but the black led and black-apologizing ESPN? Of course the big White guy, Kenny Frease for Xavier, took the shot to the left eye. Well he went right down, and another player for Cincinnati kicked him while he was down. Some African immigrant name too. Why that doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, I&rsquo;ll never know. It was a microcosm of what goes on every day in the country. This guy should be thankful his teammates had his back. When he,&#8221;came to&#8221; he should have went after the two primitives who hit him, then who stomped him. As far as the gangster comment, that is more truthful than what PC liberals say about these guys, at least he&rsquo;s honest..</p>

		<p>I think its great.  That was my honest first reaction.  The more this happens the better, period.  We are finally in a time where more and more people are pulling their heads out of the sand and pathology like this helps the awakening.  This video was viral instantly and even the mightiest spin doctor cannot hide what is going on, they can only make pathetic excuses. </p>

		<p>The white player did get punched and stompped on and bloodied up pretty good.  Stiches on his face.</p>
<p>Another white player on the team didn&rsquo;t join the fracus and was sought out by a black player who went over to the other bench just to get him.</p>
<p>People are complaining about racist comments on ESPN, but nobody talks about the racial aspect of the white guy getting singled out for a beating.</p>

		<p>Blacks have contributed three things to American sports: good running, good jumping, and unsportsmanlike like behavior.  </p>
<p>Before Blacks took over college sports, the NBA, and NFL there were occasional White bad apples, but they were seen as such and the exception that made the rule.</p>
<p>But blacks brought their tribal behavior to the game with such unsportsmanlike practices as lording over the defeated, childish bragging, TD dancing and antics after a successful play, and the ubiquitous trash talking.</p>
<p>If the referees do not control the game the violence escalates.  Notice that all three referees were Black.  Trash talking is a method of disrespecting an opponent.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;I felt disrespected for them guys to come at me and talk like that, so I let the whole staff over there and let their players know that none of them is like me. That&rsquo;s when it started.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>I have a hard time believing that a player making this remark is actually college material.  The Jesuits have truly fallen from their days of glory.  </p>
<p>There was only minor swinging in this brawl, except for the major swing when the White guy got cold cocked.  </p>
<p>Of course if ever it should happen that nine White players are on the court and one Black player and the Black player gets cold cocked by a White player, well look for the racist White player to spend 20 years in prison.  <br>

Videos of incidents like this are spreading the word on race-reality in a way, to be perfectly frank, the race-realist/white-nationalist world has largely been unable to achieve! All these so-called &#8220;flash-mobs&#8221; this past summer, incidents like this, and the manifold others like are are FORCING slumbering Whites to see race&hellip;whether they want to or not! You can only deny the evidence right before your eyes for so long! </p>
<p>And these viral videos are often accompanied by much discussion on the matter that does seem to imply that many Whites are waking up, if even just a little. And it has to start somewhere. </p>
<p>Thus, I applaud every incident like this - the more of it, the more Whites are forced to see what they have denied, or pretended not to see for decades!</p>

		<p>Basketball was once my sport. I can still taken on my high school/college nephews and do well inside and on D-Fense.  But, I have stopped being a basketball fan or else root for European teams against the &#8220;American&#8221; team in the Olympics. Letting go of allegiances to college basketball and football teams that are now Black thug teams - that&rsquo;s something basic we have to do.</p>
<p>Try out college hockey, it&rsquo;s a great sport and very popular with fans wherever it is give a fair promotion. For some reason, here in Chicago we don&rsquo;t get college hockey on TV even though the sport is huge with Big Ten College schools.</p>

		<p>An absolutely reprehensible episode, reminiscent of the infamous Minnesota-Ohio State game of 1971, where Bantus Ron Behagen and Corky Taylor on Minnesota, kicked, punched and stomped on Ohio State&rsquo;s Caucasian Luke Witte; while his teammates did nothing.</p>
<p>Hirsch, you bring up good points. I left my college behind in virtually all respects, upon graduating. I give a rat&rsquo;s cajones what happens there now, and whenever the college Alumni Association calls me up, asking for gifts, I tell them, &#8220;I gave you guys money when I went there. It&rsquo;s called tuition&#8221;.</p>
<p>Having said that, I am glad no Bantu African nation has nuclear weapons. Could you imagine Uganda unleashing a nuclear bomb at Zambia, because Uganda thought Zambia &#8220;disrespected&#8221; it? Or, nuclear weapons in Mugabe&rsquo;s hands? </p>

		<p>The solution is simple - whites should stop supporting all professional sports where blacks far outnumber the whites on the team.  That&rsquo;s where the problem is.  If whites quit putting their money down to support black criminal pro football and basketball players, this garbage would come to an end.  The same should go for college teams.  Nothing incenses me more than to see a predominately white college with a mostly black basketball or football team.  White people have been brainwashed into believing that whites can&rsquo;t play football or basketball the way blacks do.  Who played these sports before we had affirmative action shoved down our throats?  I personally don&rsquo;t care if blacks are included in anything unless they earn it, and so should the rest of white people who care about preserving the white race.  Far too long we&rsquo;ve sacrificed having children to replace ourselves, giving blacks head of line privileges for jobs, recreation, and entertainment, and what have we done?  Their numbers, along with Hispanics, have skyrocketed, and white numbers are declining.  We are the geese that are laying the golden eggs, people.  Blacks only behave this way because we tolerate them and don&rsquo;t hold them accountable.  It&rsquo;s time to pull the rug out from under these undeserving thugs, and think about our self preservation for a change.  Enough is enough.</p>

<p>Notice that both incidents involve firearms.  I&rsquo;ve seen a little bit of a meme developing here that somehow British blacks are &#8220;better&#8221; because they don&rsquo;t have &#8220;access to guns,&#8221; and those posters go on to bash &#8220;American gun culture.&#8221;  Those posters are probably convicted felons, IMHO.</p>
<p>Also, this speaks to a bit of the Mason-Dixon sniping that goes on here at times about Northern vs Southern blacks, or the ability of northern vs southern whites to deter or defend themselves against black crime.</p>
<p>Believe me, blacks are pretty much the same wherever they are.  South, North, England, whatever.  2nd Amendment, 1st Amendment, no amendment, whatever.  Constitution, no Constitution, whatever.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;t tragic when you think of the number of worthy college applicants who are denied acceptance due to the number athlete ghetto snipe thugs who get scholarships. At the very least the admissions departments should stop insulting us by calling them &#8220;scholar&#8221;ships. So far as Football and Bathquetbaw go there are few scholars. When they interview NFL players the only ones who are reasonable articulate are the QBs. and THEY are predominantly White.

		<p>This is tragic on many levels. I&rsquo;m also originally from Cincinnati and U.C. is my alma mater. Back in the day, the &#8220;Crosstown Shoot-out&#8221; was good fun. Not anymore. I also worked part-time for a very wealthy white man who was good friends with Coach Bob Huggins. One day I saw a black basketball player hanging out in the foyer and it became evident he was looking to get a &#8220;loan&#8221; from the wealthy man. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hung up my interest in sports. I used to enjoy watching college and pro football but I refuse to do it. (The Cincinnati Enquirer has been filled with stories about either a Reds player or Bengals player acting up.) I will not support criminal thuggery in any form and use my time enjoying other pleasantries; such as reading a good book or taking a walk. The UC vs. XU ghetto-behavior has severely damaged what used to be character-building exercises. At one time, young boys would look up to athletes and attend camps to learn from them. </p>
<p>Now they learn how to throw a punch and to keep out of the shower stalls. How far we have fallen!</p>

		<p>I think this is the right time to post what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for years on this very topic.</p>
<p>I graduated from a well-known basketball powerhouse Southern university in the mid-70&rsquo;s (as in NCAA championship while I was there).</p>
<p>That condition was, as it still is, the last thing I cared or thought about, 24/7/365. I suppose they still have a team, but I have a thousand more important things to think about every day. It&rsquo;s liberating to realize there&rsquo;s a whole section of Mcpaper  &mdash;  uh, USAToday, I mean  &mdash;  that I can safely and happily ignore.</p>
<p>I did it, and so can you. Repeat after me: I have a life, and it&rsquo;s not about my dumbass alma mater&rsquo;s (mostly non-white) athletics!</p>

A number of high school football jocks harassed, tortured and eventually murdered a &#8220;goth&#8221; student (because he was different and NOT a troublemaker).  As high school football is next to God and country in Texas (and their sports facilities rival those of collegiate or professional teams) and there was a football championship at stake, the &#8220;jury of their peers&#8221; ACQUITTED the murderers.</p>

		<p>The coaches&rsquo; comments would be funny if they weren&rsquo;t so pathetic. Earth to Cronin and Mack: <i>You recruited those thugs!</i> Not only did you recruit them, you coached them. If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned in more than 30 years officiating various sports, it&rsquo;s that players behave the way they&rsquo;re coached. <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/orig8/berger2.1.1.html" rel="nofollow">This tribute to a high school basketball coach</a> says it better than I ever could. So it&rsquo;s ridiculous to stand there aghast at the conduct of the gangs you&rsquo;ve created, Drs. Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Even though many of the sub-varsity basketball coaches in my hometown loved to gripe at us young referees, I respected their unanimous zero-tolerance policy on player conduct. Anyone who got a technical foul, even if he/she was the star player, always spent the rest of the game either on the bench or in the locker room.</p>
