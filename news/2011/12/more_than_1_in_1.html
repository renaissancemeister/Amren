<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a year-end tally, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency is touting the &#8220;expanding&#8221; diversity in its ranks.</p>
<p>Through &#8220;diversity recruitment initiatives&#8221; and &#8220;outreach to underrepresented groups,&#8221; the agency says it grew its workforce in fiscal 2011 to a total of 59,820 employees  &mdash;  29,013 of them minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within our workforce, diversity and inclusion remain priorities and important themes that run throughout the agency,&#8221; CBP said in a Dec. 19 news release.</p>
<p>CBP says 35 percent of its workforce is Hispanic. The percentage of females in the Border Patrol division rose 2.2 percent, and military veterans accounted for almost 20 percent of newly hired agents.</p>
<p>CBP says it &#8220;remains focused on eliminating barriers that restrict equal employment for all individuals and promoting an environment of cultural appreciation and awareness which supports the diversity and inclusiveness of our workforce.&#8221;  </p>
<p>In FY 2011, the agency says it sponsored more than 340 U.S. military veteran hiring events, 124 events at institutions serving minorities, 90 disability events, and more than 650 other events to increase workplace diversity for underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other notes from CBP&rsquo;s yearend roundup:</p>
<p>U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions between ports of entry  &mdash;  described as a key indicator of illegal immigration  &mdash;  decreased to 340,252 in fiscal year 2011, down 53 percent since FY 2008 and one fifth of what they were at their peak in FY 2000. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m SO SICK of hearing diversity propaganda (Diversiganda) that I just want to SCREAM!  According to this doctrine, institutions that are 100% black, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American are completely &#8220;diversified,&#8221; whereas a 100% white institution is completely non-diverse and worthy of suspicion, scorn, and contempt.</p>
<p>Ironically, a 100% white institution would probably be more &#8220;diverse&#8221; than a comparable 100% minority institution in myriad ways  &mdash;  more diverse in terms of hair color, eye color, political opinions, hobbies, personalities, IQ levels, dialects, ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Of course, these examples of REAL diversity are all for naught if they are not served up with a big steaming pile of brown  &mdash;  the only type of diversity DWLs care about.  </p>

		<p>Through &ldquo;diversity recruitment initiatives&rdquo; and &ldquo;outreach to underrepresented groups,&rdquo; the agency says it grew its workforce in fiscal 2011 to a total of 59,820 employees &mdash; 29,013 of them minorities.</p>
<p>According to the simple math calculated in my head, that means that just under 50% of all CBP employees are non Whites. This doesn&rsquo;t sound very representative of the American population as a whole. Perhaps a lawsuit is in order. And while &#8220;we&#8221; are at it, I think a USPS headcount would show a similar problem. </p>

		<p>ORWELLIAN OBAMA ADMIN. PRESS RELEASE OF THE YEAR?</p>
<p>link to CBP.GOV press release<br>

<p>CBP Highlights 2011 Workforce Improvements</p>
<p>(Monday, December 19, 2011)</p>
<p>Washington - In fiscal year 2011, CBP strengthened its workforce by expanding and adding diversity to the ranks. Through diversity recruitment initiatives and promoting inclusion throughout the workforce, the agency strives to value, understand and incorporate the uniqueness each employee brings to the workplace.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, CBP grew its workforce, increasing its total employees to 59,820. CBP also exceeded its hiring goal of 21,370 Border Patrol agents before the end of the fiscal year. The percentage of females in the Border Patrol rose 2.2 percent and military veterans accounted for almost 20 percent of newly hired agents.</p>
<p>Within our workforce, diversity and inclusion remain priorities and important themes that run throughout the agency. CBP experienced growing diversity this fiscal year as more than one in three employees is of Hispanic origin. CBP&rsquo;s 35 percent Hispanic labor force outpaces the relevant private sector labor force, at 9 percent. As a result of targeted outreach to underrepresented groups and focused recruitment activities, CBP reached a total minority workforce population of 29,013.</p>
<p>CBP remains focused on eliminating barriers that restrict equal employment for all individuals and promoting an environment of cultural appreciation and awareness which supports the diversity and inclusiveness of our workforce. In FY 2011, the agency continued to implement its diversity-driven National Recruitment Strategy that included sponsoring more than 340 U.S. military veteran hiring events, 124 events at minority serving institutions, 90 disability and special emphasis events, and more than 650 other events to increase workplace diversity for underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>Furthering this commitment, the agency created a gateway for veterans who have been wounded while serving in the military to connect with hiring officials for fast-track placement within CBP. As a result of this program, five individuals were placed into permanent positions with CBP. <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Workforce Improvements&#8221; = Less white is an improvement. Just like the Obama presidency itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;diversity recruitment initiatives&#8221; = hiring by race, favoring non-whites</p>
<p>&#8220;promoting inclusion&#8221; = except for disfavored whites</p>
<p>&#8220;strives to value, understand and incorporate the uniqueness each employee brings to the workplace.&#8221; = which is why we focus on race rather than color-blind individual merit. And when we speak of &#8216;cultural appreciation&rsquo; [see below] of course we mean each unique individual culture of each unique individual, not some group, national origin or ethnic thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;more than one in three employees is of Hispanic origin.&#8221; = don&rsquo;t we have some nerve talking about &#8220;targeted outreach to underrepresented groups&#8221; as we brag about how overepresented Hispanics already are. And how underrepesented whites now are.</p>
<p>&#8220;total employees to 59,820&#8221; &#8220;a total minority workforce population of 29,013&#8221; = &#8216;minority&rsquo; is darn near the majority at 48.5% already and we&rsquo;re not done yet</p>
<p>&#8220;focused on eliminating barriers that restrict equal employment for all individuals&#8221; = unless they are white, of course</p>
<p>&#8220;promoting an environment of cultural appreciation&#8221; = Hispanization is our highest value here, not border security</p>
<p>&#8220;124 events at minority serving institutions&#8221; = no, of course we don&rsquo;t mean Food Stamp offices, Section 8 offices and prisons, you racist.</p>
<p>SERIOUSLY folks this document and the policies it glorifies are obviously and blatantly contrary to Equal Opportunity and Non-Discrimination by race and are clearly about reducing employment of white males.</p>
<p>It is not at all subtle. It is right there in our face. We have been taking it for a long time now. Even Republicans do little or nothing to stop it. The Supreme Court nearly always sanctifies it, ever since the 1978 Bakke decision opened the door to discrimination for the purpose increasing Diversity and remedying Underrepresentation.</p>
<p>Harken back to the competing strategies for opposing Communism in the world during the Cold War.</p>

		<p>This does not surprise me in the least. The anti-American bias, among &#8220;American&#8221; managers is appallingly common. For example, the Principal of Green Mountain High School in Jefferson County Public Schools ignored qualified American applicants for teaching positions and went directly to Mexico to hire a Mexican. He told me that he was not going to consider Americans and was going to recruit a Mexican in Mexico! This happened about 1999. This kind of thing is much worse now than in 1999.</p>

		<p>The problem with this approach is that bad eggs are going to be hired or corrupted whilst working and it will be very difficult to detect until a lot of damage is done. Ex. How are ethnic gangs from China, Vietnam, Russia etc going to be combated? Agents will have to be recruited who are native speakers and who will be able to tell if they are rogues? DHS should have a new department- the GGCP.The Department of Goats Guarding the Cabbage Patch.</p>

<p>This is one big lie! This is one big lie! This is one big lie!</p>
<p>Pass this one to everyone.</p>
<p>Applications were passed out at these events, 30,000 taken and almost ALMOST ALL just thrown away. They DID NOT TELL THE APPLICANTS that a MUST requirement is a knowledge of fluent conversational Spanish. They DID NOT tell the persons filling out the forms that this was A MUST! This taking of applications was truly just for cosmetic appearance and nothing more. They are a bunch of duplicitous villains and we all know it. Pass this on to everyone.</p>

		<p>In addition, how many of these hispanic border agents are the spawn of those who entered this country in violation of the very laws they are now charged with protecting? </p>
<p>If this is not the &ldquo;fox guarding the hen house&rdquo; then I do not know what is. Many of these hispanic &#8220;American citizens&#8221; still have significant family ties (and perhaps loyalties to mexico) to the country responsible for violating our sovereignty a million times over. Toss in the la raza mindset and it is a recipe for disaster.  </p>

		<p>Conveying citizenship to the offspring of those who entered this country in violation of our immigration laws is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind. The 14th Amendment is now being used against American to further the nefarious subjugation of our country. The social doctrine of multiculturalism and diversity has been used as a springboard to propel these &#8220;diverse&#8221; souls into government employment. </p>
<p>Some of those faux American citizens are actually in charge of protecting the very borders their parents violated. </p>
<p>Imagine if you could, 20 million White Americans violating mexico&rsquo;s sovereignty. Further imagine those White Americans had anchor babies in mexico, in which mexico&rsquo;s constitution conveyed birthright citizenship to said offspring. Some of those Mexican citizens then go on to get jobs with mexico&rsquo;s government, guarding their northern border with America. They are hired under the doctrine of multiculturalism and diversity (because they are White) and because they speak English, the same language those violating mexico&rsquo;s northern border speak. </p>
<p>Sounds crazy doesn&rsquo;t it! <br>

<p>It was actually the double bombs of Kaiser vs. Weber and Griggs vs Duke Power in the early 1970&rsquo;s, I think 71 or 72.  They say knowledge is power, but not for Whites.</p>
<p>We can know everything there is to know about affirmative action, but we can&rsquo;t use that knowledge except to brood about our ongoing extinction.</p>
<p>Kaiser vs Weber extablished that applicants for the position of foreman in steel mills did not have to have a high school diploma or 8th grade reading skills if they were black.</p>
<p>Griggs established that it was racist and discsiminatory to require that job applicants had graduated from 6TH GRADE if they were black.</p>
<p>Remember, these decisions were not made in 1870 when many <br>
White and black southerners dropped out of school at age 8 to work on the hardscrabble farms, but in 1970.  </p>
<p>Kaiser was even more ridiculous.  The court alos got rid of the foreman&rsquo;s test for balcks.  The test had questions such as;</p>
<p>There are 27 men in your department.  You cannot run the department with fewer than 18.  How many men can go on vaction at the same time?</p>
<p>It is flu season.  Only 15 men showed up today.  What do you do?</p>
<p>(A)  Do the best you can with what you have?<br>
(B)  Shut down the deaprtment?<br>
(C)  Call HR and ask them to send you enough people to run the department.</p>
<p>A foreman should be able to pass such a test.  He or she should be able to read, understand and explain to his workers memos.  He should be able to make out vacation schedules.</p>
<p>This country is becoming mexico, only we will be the starving peons.  Actually worse off, because in mexico the peons manage to survive.  People consider me pessimistic, but in 100 years I firmly believe that Whites will not only be banned from employment, but from any and all kinds of welfare and benefits.</p>
<p>If you are young enough, change your last name to a hispanic one.  If you have children, do it before they enter high school. Remember, average White IQ and a B average in high school will get a White nothing.  Combine that with a hispanic last name and it will be a full scholarship to the best colleges and dozens of job offers starting first semester of senior year.</p>
<p>Read up a little on the history of Catholics in England.  For 300 years the religion was outlawed.  The Catholics just went underground, went to the Anglican church and thus were not penalized.  Had they stayed Catholics most jobs and occupations would have been forbidden by law.</p>
<p>When Catholicism was decriminalized in 1833, it turned out that about 15 to 30 percent of the population, and not just recent Irish immigrants but English had been hidden Catholics all those years.</p>
<p>The other solution of course is to do what the White immigrants do, a sleazy little crooked business, no payment of taxes and just lie, cheat and steal all your life.</p>
<p>Easier to just change your name from Rogers to Rodriguez.</p>

		<p>Even the hispanic replacement cheer leader the Los Angeles Slimes has published articles about hispanic DMV employees.</p>
<p>In California, the person behind the counter at the computer has the authority to decide if the documentation presented is valid identification.</p>
<p>Hispanics were accepting anything or nothing at all from other hispanics.  The other hispanics were not just their friends and relatives, but illegal alien convicted felons and gang members.<br>
The DMV clerks applied for the jobs at the behest of gang members with the intention of giving out valid California ID in false names to illegal alien organized crime gangs.</p>
<p>Makes the black DMV clerks look pretty good.  One thing to remember, is that hispanic organized crime is more like the old mafia, a very family oriented thing.  So all they have to do is get just one clerk into the DMV and he or she can give out valid California  Id and licenses to dozens.</p>
<p>There is really no way to catch them.  </p>

 <br>
Uh, not so fast:</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Alan Bersin announced his resignation effective December 30. Actually, Bersin is not retiring or resigning, he was unable to get a vote in the Senate for confirmation and was given a recess appointment that expired.</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will now be headed by Napolitano appointee David Aguilar, another acting head.  David Aguilar, former Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol is a pro-open borders, amnesty fanatic.</p>
<p>The Examiner reports:</p>
<p><i>Agents Have &#8216;No Confidence&rsquo; In New U.S. Customs And Border Protection Chief</i></p>
<p><i>Aguilar&rsquo;s support for the prosecution of several Border Patrol agents by the Bush administration for so-called civil rights violations against illegal aliens (even drug smugglers), such as those of Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean have contributed to the lack of support the rank and file agents have in their own boss.</i></p>

		<p>Border Patrol figures are perhaps worse than the article leads one to believe. </p>
<p>I would like to see the percent adjusted for BP personnel who are within 5 years of retirement. Drop these &#8220;old guards&#8221; out and those remaining might represent more than 40 percent Mexican ethnics.  This would display the real intent of recent recruiting.  </p>
<p>Still better if the ethnic breakdown for graduate recruits from training could be pried out of the inept CBP, Office of Training Development (OTD), we would have a definitive answer.  BTW, I&rsquo;ve requested FOIA material from CBP, OTD and they ignore me.  <br>
 <br>
To Jeddermann:  A few years ago BP recruits didn&rsquo;t have to know conversational Spanish to be hired and I think that is still so.  Yet, the catch was that white boys who didn&rsquo;t know job level Spanish had to take a test that &#8220;assessed&#8221; their ability to learn the language.  Many failed this test.    </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at the stats for this language ability test and the exam is predicative of nothing, but it has become a tool to weed out los pinche gingos.  The Spanish needed by BP agents is very limited and basic. </p>
<p>You must consider as well that the eight weeks of BP Spanish training is boring enough to make your brain melt. This causes more white recruits to quit or be dropped from the program, which is the goal.  </p>
