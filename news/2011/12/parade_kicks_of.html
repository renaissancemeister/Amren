<h1><a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2011/12/26/kwanzaa-parade-preps-underway-on-crenshaw-boulevard/">Parade Kicks Off Kwanzaa Celebration in LA</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS Los Angeles, December 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A parade is underway along Crenshaw Boulevard Monday to mark the start of the seven-day African American festival of Kwanzaa.</p>
<p>The theme of the 35th annual Kwanzaa Gwaride Parade and Festival will be &#8220;A New Paradigm,&#8221; according to R.W. Akile for People of Color, which organizes the parade and festival.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The celebration of the 45th anniversary of Kwanzaa is a significant marker and milestone in itself, not only because of what it says about the expansive message and enduring meaning that Kwanzaa has for millions throughout the world African community, but also because of what it says about us as a people,&#8221; Maulana Karenga wrote in his annual founder&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>&#8220;For it speaks to our profound commitment to self-determination, to cultural reaffirmation and the celebration of ourselves; to our right and responsibility to speak our own special cultural truth in a multicultural world and to the practice and promotion of Kwanzaa&rsquo;s core principles, the Nguzo Saba, the Seven Principles, the hub and hinge on which the holiday turns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kwanzaa was created by Karenga in 1966 and is observed from Dec. 26 though Jan. 1. Its focus is on seven principles  &mdash;  unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t want self-determination; they want to vamp off Whites for eternity. An &#8220;honest&#8221; Kwanzaa would celebrate the values of theft, rape, lying, murder, and laziness.</p>

		<p>Karenga was a black separatist and supremacist, and also went to jail for kidnapping and torture of 2 women. So he invents a &#8221; holiday &#8221; so that blacks can celebrate something other than the Christian holiday Christmas. Very few, estimated to be somewhere around 1% of blacks celebrate Kwanzaa, yet the white guilt libtards still try and force it down our throats ? </p>
<p>Maybe a skinhead should invent a holiday based on some bits and pieces of different European holidays, and all the whites in the world can celebrate it together ! I bet the liberals will welcome this newly invented holiday with open arms.</p>

		<p>In the 1990s, we used to hear a lot about Kwanzaa.  Now you need a microscope to find any MSM coverage of Kwanzaa.  I think the main reason why it flopped is because Kwanzaa has become a fringe holiday among blacks, and the reason for that is because it&rsquo;s mostly fringe radical blacks that celebrate Kwanzaa.</p>

		<p>You can smell the desperation coming off that video! What were there, 50 parade participants and twelve parade watchers? Pathetic! </p>
<p>No one, absolutely NO ONE save for a literal handful of Black militants and Guilty-White-Liberal school teachers can even pretend to care about this concocted Black-Marxist nonsense anymore. For God&rsquo;s sake, I live in New York, and even the unapologetically pro-Black network news stations from NYC could muster nothing more than a fleetingly brief mention of the &#8220;holiday.&#8221; The average Black doesn&rsquo;t give a tinker&rsquo;s damn about &#8220;Kwanzaa.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Kwanzaa- A phony &#8216;celebration&rsquo; that American blacks (some of them; I&rsquo;ve heard there are blacks that don&rsquo;t celebrate it) celebrate, despite that such a celebration doesn&rsquo;t exist elsewhere. Not even blacks in Africa celebrate it, as it doesn&rsquo;t exist. My oh my&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, I observed the same thing. ONLY one mention on the news of Kwanzaa did I see at all. Used to be everywhere. NOT NOW.</p>
<p>Crenshaw is in what is called South LA? That is mostly a Mexican area now? Maybe someone from that area can clarify.</p>

		<p>The inventor of Kwanzaa, Ronald Everett (aka Malauna Karenga)enunciated a series of &#8220;principles&#8221; associated with his synthesized holiday. Some of them are good ideas for anyone. Taken together, they constitute a recipe for gridlock and isolation.

		<p>I remember when Kwanzaa was first started, it was openly to allow the black parents to take better advantage of the after-Christmas sales.  The idea that it had anything to do with anything but conspicuous consumption was an afterthought.</p>

		<p>Lord have mercy, they DO love to march. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what for; just get a few together and call it a &#8216;march&rsquo;. A black arrest; march! Require photo ID to vote; march! Jesse and Al are in town; march! A store running out of black tennies a Christmas; first riot, then march! </p>
<p>Considering how many blacks kill each other when they get together in numbers, they&rsquo;ll have a lot of reasons to march in the 7 days of their black celebration.</p>

<p><br>
The problem is, anything that is fringe in its own community of origin becomes a <i>cause celebre&#8221;</i> within the leftist branch of the American elite. Think of Kwanzaa itself, and while you are at it, think of Native American-derived names for athletic teams and so on.</p>
<p>Think also of the American elite&rsquo;s &#8220;everything made in China&#8221; policy. Who supports that within the mainstream of the American population? Not the whites, Hispanics and blacks who would be glad to fill the millions of lost manufacturing jobs even at lower relative wages than past generations enjoyed.</p>

<p> Ron Karenga ( his name is as phony as he is) is a vicious, sadistic criminal and perhaps a murderer and he&rsquo;s a phony professor of a phony &#8220;studies&#8221; course at what I must assume is a phony institution of &#8220;higher learning&#8221;. What a bloody ( literally as well as figuratively) abomination.</p>

		<p>Has anyone else noticed that you hardly hear about &#8220;Kwanzaa&#8221; anymore? That in itself is reason to celebrate. My favorite quote about this ridiculous &#8220;holiday&#8221; comes from the founder himself on why he put it in December:<br>
&ldquo;People think it&rsquo;s African, but it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; admitted Karenga in a 1978 Washington Post interview. &ldquo;I put it around Christmas because I knew that&rsquo;s when a lot of &lsquo;bloods&rsquo; [Blacks] would be partying.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always found it funny that this clown Karenga went out and invented a holiday instead of simply relying on the many &#8220;celebrations&#8221; performed in the Old Country.  He could have just picked one from the west coast of Afreeka.  Instead, he invents some mishmash of generalities, gives it a name that comes from EAST Afreeka (even though no American slaves came from east Afreeka) &hellip; and there you are.  Like $200 sneakers it&rsquo;s always form over substance with the IQ-challenged blacks.</p>
