<h1><a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/12/villaraigosa-urges-governor-suspend-participation-secure-communities.html">Villaraigosa Asks California to Halt Role in Secure Communities</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paloma Esquivel, Los Angeles Times, December 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has written to Gov. Jerry Brown asking him to suspend California&rsquo;s participation in the Secure Communities immigration enforcement program.</p>
<p>In his letter, written this month, Villaraigosa said issues with the program &#8220;have been and remain significant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under Secure Communities, which began in 2008, fingerprints collected by state and local police are shared with immigration authorities to identify and deport tens of thousands of people each year.</p>
<p>The program was initially promoted as a way to target serious convicts for deportation, but it has come under fire because a large percentage of immigrants caught up in the program were never convicted of a crime or are low-level offenders. The American Civil Liberties Union this week pointed to four U.S. citizens who it said were illegally detained as a result of Los Angeles County participation in the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>States, including Illinois and New York, attempted this year to suspend the Secure Communities program, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have said it is a federal information sharing program and that states cannot withdraw.</p>

		<p>I am a native English speaker but I speak Spanish well enough to watch Spanish networks. Last night I turned on a news show on Univision. I missed the beginning of the interview so I didn&rsquo;t catck his name but a Spanish speaking congressman was on the show. </p>
<p>The moderator/interviewer asked him about &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221; and whether that was a good reason to make strict gun laws for <br>
Americna citizens. The congressman said that that was rediculous and that that was what the justice department had tried to do with &#8220;Fast and Furious.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interviewer got enraged and said that he remembered the last time the congressman had been on and that the congressman had said that all of the illlegal aliens should go home and apply for citizenship through the proper channels. The congressman said that that was correct and that they should do so. The host was absolutely livid, he could barely control his rage!</p>
<p>Then a pop singer from Argentina came on and the interviewer tried to get him to endorse just the communist regimes (like Chavez) in South America. The pop singer refused. But then when questioned on the immigration issue, the pop singer said how badly the Mexicans were treated and that they have to be here for years upon years and can&rsquo;t go back to visit their families! That is absurd! They come and go as they please. I have seen it many times and I know how casually they go back and forth because of personal experience.</p>
<p>Then a reporter reported from Alabama about protests against the new immigration law. The reporter called the law racist! Apparently we do not have a right to regulate immigration in our own country and that piece of work called US racist!</p>

<p>I feel confident that an LA Times reporter with a name like Paloma Esquivel will give us a fair, objective, dispassionate and politically neutral assessment of this issue, with no &#8220;slant&#8221; of any kind. </p>

		<p>VivaLaRaza is hell bent on into turning Los Angeles into a 100% corrupt, anarchic, dangerous, filthy mexican city. I&rsquo;d say he is about 80% there.  He makes sure violent illegal gang members are made to feel safe and secure through Special Order 40 and that &#8220;gang programs&#8221; are run by ex-cons cronies   &mdash;   and who keep getting arrested even while riding the taxpayer gravy train.</p>
<p>Remember, this moron&rsquo;s directive to end 30-day vehicle holds on unlicensed drivers? </p>
<p>Unlicensed, uninsured, illegal aliens have free reign to wreck havoc on the streets of LA.</p>
<p>The Police Protective League President Paul M. Weber stated  <i>The Mayor&rsquo;s directive puts politics above public safety and should be rescinded.</i></p>
<p>This past Sunday:</p>
<p><i>Pedestrian Killed by Unlicensed Driver, NBC Los Angeles, Sunday.</i></p>
<p><i>Patricia Ellen Riedy, of Wildwood, Mo., was crossing Woodman Avenue in Panorama City at 5:35 a.m. Saturday when she was struck by a black Ford Explorer. The 60-year-old died at the scene</i></p>
<p><i>The driver, 36-year-old Martha Cruz of Panorama City, did not have a valid California drivers license, Emard said. Because Cruz cooperated with police, she was not arrested at the scene or charged with a crime in connection with the collision.</i></p>
<p>As long as LA still stands, and, as LAs demographics have changed irreversibly, anti-white, no brains mexican politician like Villar (real name) will continue to be elected and re-elected  (Villar has failed the CA State Bar Exam four times   &mdash;     would a white politician been able to run for office after exhibiting this type of failure?)</p>

<p>========================================================</p>
<p>How in the hell can you kill someone while driving without a valid license and escape arrest simply because you &#8220;cooperated&#8221; with police! So mexicans simply have to cooperate with police and the police look the other way!</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sake, Los Angeles is starting to resemble mexico more and more each day! Where does this madness end??</p>

		<p> Only in Los Angeles can an illegal invading mexican ( I&rsquo;ll take my chances and presume this mexican is illegal) hit and kill a pedestrian while driving without a license and not be arrested because she &#8220;cooperated&#8221; with police!  Even if this Mexican is illegal, the LAPD will dare not ask about her immigration status! That is major no-no here in LA!</p>
<p>Los Angeles is Tijuana el norte! When you put corrupted mexicans in power this is what you get. A lawless third-world society, where the law is arbitrarily enforced based upon one&rsquo;s ethnicity. The illegal invading mexicans, (through their &ldquo;immigrant advocacy&rdquo; efforts) have created a situation where they are exempt from obeying our laws!</p>
<p><br>
How bad can it get here?</p>
