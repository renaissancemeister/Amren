			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, December 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, responding to criticism for including &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; in its latest edition, will add a label identifying the politically-charged term either as &#8220;derogatory&#8221; or &#8220;offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change comes after Immigrationimpact.com, a project of the nonprofit American Immigration Council, questioned the inclusion of the &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; definition without describing its pejorative nature:</p>
<blockquote>The degree to which the immigration debate has coarsened over the last few years is no more evident than in the pages of the recently released fifth edition of the New American Heritage Dictionary. Among the new entries is the term &#8216;anchor baby.&rsquo; You might think that the definition would read something like: slang, a pejorative description of a child born in the United States to parents without legal status, implying that the parents intend to leverage the child&rsquo;s citizenship to &#8216;anchor&rsquo; their own presence in the U.S. You would be wrong.</blockquote>
<p>The online version of the American Heritage Dictionary defines &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; as:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;A child born to a noncitizen mother in a country that grants automatic citizenship to children born on its soil, especially such a child born to parents seeking to secure eventual citizenship for themselves and often other members of their family.&#8221;
</blockquote>
Over the weekend, Immigrationimpact.com reported that Steven Kleinedler, the dictionary&rsquo;s executive editor, said a &#8220;swift and careful revision&#8221; of the term&rsquo;s use was under way. American Heritage Dictionary, he said, was &#8220;adding a label &hellip; either derogatory or offensive, which I acknowledge should have been done in the first place, and we will determine how to revise the definition.&#8221;

		<p>Actually, the phrase &#8220;anchor relative&#8221; is included in USCIS instructions for immigrant applicants. It simply means the original naturalized citizens who then apply for their relatives. Leaving aside the fact that naturalization is way too liberal, &#8220;anchor&#8221; itself is a neutral term. That it is now &#8220;verboten&#8221; is just another example of open border thought control.     </p>

		<p>Using the anchor baby scam is extemely aggressive and offesive and is a racial attack on real American citizens! Supporting the aggressive anchor baby attack is treason.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Anchor baby&rsquo; is a very concise, accurate, descriptive term.  </p>
<p>This is nothing less than an attempt to influence the debate by making everyone use the more cumbersome and eye-glazing  &#8220;birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens born on U.S. soil for the purposes of leveraging eventual citizenship or benefits for the parents&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This law must be changed! Along with the lure of jobs, this is the biggest magnet for people who break into our country. Witness the growth of the &#8220;citizenship&#8221; travel industry.&#8221; Are we going to continue to be wimps, or can we once again be the nation that we always were until the votes/cheap labor gangs took over. The 14th amendment never intended the recognition of slaves to morph into handing out American citizenship like it means nothing. I&rsquo;m with Michelle Bachmann on this. She is all for the deportation of illegal aliens. Now, if we can get this travesty of anchor baby giveway fixed, we&rsquo;re ahead of the game.</p>

		<p>Every inconvenient fact is pejorative to the left.  Children born to illegal aliens are in fact used as an &#8220;anchor&#8221; that makes it harder to deport the mother.</p>

		<p>This is a not-too-subtle method of &#8220;chilling&#8221; freedom of expression.  An interest group deems terms that are not positive as offensive and pejorative.  This then curtails the terms use in polite society, the press and political speech.  Anchor baby has been used since the late 1980s to describe the a child born on US soil effect in increasing the chances of non-citizen parents to remain here.  It applies to all aliens, and is not that of any particular racial or ethnic group.  It is a perfect descriptor.  And just what alternatives to &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; are there now that politicians and pundits will be called racist if they use that term?</p>

		<p>Fine, Pancho.  We&rsquo;ll stop using the terms &#8216;anchor baby&rsquo; or &#8216;illegal immigrant&rsquo; if you stop calling us racists, xenophobes, nationalists, bigots, nazis, gringos, and all the rest.  </p>

<p>This is exactly the direction the la raza racists intend to go with this. Get the term anchor baby defined as offensive, and then get a law passed that classifies the use of this term as hate speech. With all the la raza traitors within our three branches of government, who knows what could happen.</p>
<p>I will continue to use the term anchor baby when referring to the spawn of illegal invaders because that&rsquo;s exactly what they are. I also fancy the term jackpot baby as well.</p>
