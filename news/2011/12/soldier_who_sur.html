			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A U.S. Army soldier who survived a suicide bombing while serving in Afghanistan was hospitalized Friday after being shot at his homecoming party.</p>
<p>Family members tell the San Bernardino Sun that 22-year-old Christopher Sullivan was rushed to the hospital in critical condition.</p>
<p>&#8216;My son didn&rsquo;t deserve this. He served his country,&rsquo; his mother Suzanne Sullivan told the Sun.</p>
<p>She said her son suffered two gunshot wounds to his back, which shattered his spine, leaving him paralyzed, the Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Sullivan was shot Friday night at a party that friends threw for him at a home in San Bernardino.</p>
<p>Police said Sullivan&rsquo;s brother and a partygoer got into an argument.</p>
<p>When Sullivan moved to break up the fight, the man pulled a gun and opened fire at Sullivan.</p>
<p>The gunman fled the scene before police arrived.</p>
<p>Sullivan was wounded in a suicide bombing attack last year in Kandahar while serving with the 101st Infantry Division.</p>
<p>He suffered a cracked collar bone and brain damage in the attack and has been recovering in Kentucky where he is stationed.</p>
<p>He was home on leave when the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>His enlistment would be complete in April, after which Sullivan had planned to come home to go to college.</p>
<p>Family members are calling on the shooter to surrender.</p>
<p>Police have not identified the suspect.</p>

<p>Alternate version.  Here are the juicy nuggets:</p>
<p><i>During his teenage years, he ran with gangs to help his mother pay the bills&hellip;Sullivan and his siblings grew up without their father and often lived in neighborhoods where gangs were active, his aunt said. Sullivan, a big, energetic child, always seemed to be the one defending himself and his brothers. He became involved with gangs as a teenager but later made the decision to &ldquo;turn his life around,&rdquo; his aunt said.</i></p>
<p>Another version (lost the URL) indicates that his mother and most of his relatives have Spanish names.  I wonder how he got to be plain ole &#8220;Christopher Sullivan.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What a shame, but not a surprise. I read an article that stated a lot of gang bangers had enlisted in our military. And even though Christopher Sullivan may not have been one, it sure sounds like there were thugs at his party. San Bernardino, Cal. is not the best of neighborhoods. And why have police not identifed a subject? I hope it&rsquo;s not because of the street code of not ratting out others, compounding this tradegy.</p>

		<p>Ruben Ray Jurado, 19, has been arrested for the shooting.  The young soldier remains on life support.  Apparently, the shooter was an acquaintance, and Mr. Sullivan was defending his brother from an attack from Jurado when shot.</p>

		<p>I could be wrong, but why do I get the feeling the shooter is either Black or Hispanic?  These compulsive actions are usually attributed to either one of the above.  No doubt, Jamaal or Chico was getting vulgar with a white woman at a party and a white man tried to intervene on her behalf and was shot for it. Certainly, I could be wrong, but I guess we&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>

		<p>Whenever I hear people say that former members of the military served &#8220;their country&#8221;, I think more of the person having volunteered, because U.S.A. was not under any imminent threat of attack from the vast majority of these wars. Then-U.S. President George W. Bush was correct: they &#8220;volunteered&#8221;!! Anybody who volunteers to join the military is put on notice that they are subjected to being killed or maimed in battle! In this matter, an argument broke out between the victim&rsquo;s close relative and a guest? For gunfire to take place in that scenario suggests either this is a situation involving a gang or ghetto.  Update me on more recent developments in this case. Who is the suspect? A total stranger invited to his coming home party?</p>

		<p>Years ago now it was observed that a young American black man serving in the U.S. military was SIXTY time safer on a military post than he was in his own neighborhood.</p>
<p>These guys returning from Iraq and Afghan are probably at greater danger of being shot and killed in their own neighborhood than they were of being killed or wounded in combat.</p>

		<p>The victim looks about 1/2 White - with an Irish name of &#8220;Sullivan&#8221; (yeah, I know Anglo blue bloods try to argue that the Irish aren&rsquo;t White). The suspects looks like a Mestizo gang banger, probably jealous of the attention and army uniforms of the Whiter Hispanic.</p>
<p>American Renaissance needs to come up with some strong program to recruit White, Whiter Hispanics. Hispanic Whites have historically been some of our best fighters against Moors, Aztecs, Indian Marxists in Central America turn M13 gang bangers in California. </p>
<p>Spain is a White European country and the South American world cup soccer teams in the last (South Africa) world cup were all White, much whiter than the French and English national teams.</p>
<p>Go White Hispanics</p>
