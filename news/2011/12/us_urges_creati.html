			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Dillon, New York Times, December 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration on Friday urged colleges and universities to get creative in improving racial diversity at their campuses, throwing out a Bush-era interpretation of recent Supreme Court rulings that limited affirmative action in admissions.</p>
<p>The new guidelines issued by the Departments of Justice and Education replaced a 2008 document that essentially warned colleges and universities against considering race at all. Instead, the guidelines focus on the wiggle room in the court decisions involving the University of Michigan, suggesting that institutions use other criteria  &mdash;  students&rsquo; socioeconomic profiles, residential instability, the hardships they have overcome  &mdash;  that are often proxies for race. Schools could even grant preferences to students from certain schools selected for, among other things, their racial composition, the new document says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Post-secondary institutions can voluntarily consider race to further the compelling interest of achieving diversity,&#8221; reads the 10-page guide sent to thousands of college admissions officials on Friday afternoon. In some cases, it says, &#8220;race can be outcome determinative.&#8221;</p>
<p>The administration issued a parallel 14-page outline on Friday for the nation&rsquo;s 17,000 public school districts, explaining what government lawyers consider to be acceptable ways that educators can seek to reduce racial segregation, which has been increasing nationwide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The contrast with the Bush guidelines interpreting the same three cases is stark. Where the Bush administration&rsquo;s letter in 2008 states, &#8220;Quotas are impermissible,&#8221; the 2011 version says &#8220;an institution may permissibly aim to achieve a critical mass of underrepresented students.&#8221; Even in addressing the same principles, the framework is practically reversed.</p>
<p>Bush guidelines: &#8220;Before using race, there must be a serious good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama guidelines: &#8220;Institutions are not required to implement race-neutral approaches if, in their judgment, the approaches would be unworkable.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ada Meloy, general counsel for the American Council on Education, which represents 1,800 universities and colleges, predicted that educators would immediately begin to pursue ways to draw more racial minorities, as the new guidelines would ease fears of legal challenge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Diverse learning environments promote development of analytical skills, dismantle stereotypes and prepare students to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world,&#8221; Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will soon decide whether to hear a new case, in which a white student has sued the University of Texas, arguing that she was denied admission because of her race. {snip}</p>

		<p>The headline should read that the Obama/Holder Administration wants universities to use newer, craftier, more devious ways to deprive whites of equal opportunity and admit lesser qualified Blacks and Hispanics.  Sadly, university admissions offices will probably gladly comply.</p>

After reading through this myself, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that I will vote on WHOMEVER the Republicans run! We as Whites will not last thru another four years of this Muslim racist. Pass this on to as many people that you can and tell them to pass it to others, this guy has got to be stopped!  </p>

		<p>A five year old can see through this charade! Can they really believe they are being slick or clever in circumventing the rulings against this naked discrimination against Whites? Or, more probably, they don&rsquo;t care as the courts and the White House are virtually all in cahoots against White interests. </p>

		<p>Diverse learning environments are great.  It helps female students learn about rape, it helps the staff learn about the need for an African American Studies Dept and other can&rsquo;t-fail majors, and it provides an opportunity for a whole diversity industry to come in and suck up billions of taxpayer dollars.  It also prepares a generation of blacks for lucrative public service careers.  What&rsquo;s not to like!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so ready for the Day of Anger, which is coming, soon I hope, when whites (and maybe also some Asians, I hope) will wake up and say, &#8220;we&rsquo;re done.  This is the end.  No more race card.  No more AA.  No more welfare, make-work AA government jobs, Section 8, WIC, TANF and all the other state and local programs.  Get a job or starve.&#8221;  And many formerly middle class blacks will suddenly find themselves living Third World type lifestyles and will be angry, but that&rsquo;s something that I know we can deal with.</p>
<p>I know the Post Office is on the verge of laying off about 200,000 blacks.  I hope many other agencies at all levels will join them.  They&rsquo;ve been telling us for so long how diversity is strength.  Ok, now let&rsquo;s see what these blacks can contribute to the private sector.</p>

		<p>How did racial and ethnic diversity ever come to be regarded as a national advantage?  It seems that this strange notion came into wide circulation simply by being repeated. &#8220;Diversity is our strength!&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, diversity in skills and talents is essential to any advanced society, else we&rsquo;d still be living like black Africans in Zambia. But diversity racially and ethnically is never a strength.  At best, it&rsquo;s a source of trouble and conflict to be overcome.  At worst, it&rsquo;s a source of trouble and conflict which often isn&rsquo;t overcome.   That&rsquo;s where we are today in the US, where the UK finds itself with non-whites flooding in, where every island in the Caribbean is today, Brazil, Mexico, practically all of Africa, even Canada as Somalis arrive.</p>
<p>Diversity is our strength?  A more ridiculous notion has yet to be suggested.</p>

<p>On the contrary. Being around minorities affirms stereotypes.</p>
<p>I said Grutter v. Bollinger settled nothing. All it said was 1) you can&rsquo;t have quotas BUT 2) race COULD be used as a determining factor. Hence the &#8216;wiggle&rsquo; room.</p>

		<p>The public has been mislead to believe the lie that &#8220;diversity&#8221; is some type of noble goal. Until diversity is discredited we will continue to have untold problems.</p>
<p>Simply take another word that sounds good but has no true meaning and substitute it for &#8221; diversity&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll see part of this problem.</p>
<p>Truth, justice, The American Way&hellip;liberty, etc&hellip;read the above and make the substitutions. </p>

		<p>diversity in college brought in black students who beat up gays and robbed the smaller oriental students on a regular basis.  they also set up no go areas for white students under threat of violence  Not to be out done the hispanic folk attacked registering freshmen with pipes and sent some white girls to the hospital for not running fast enough.  No one was arrested.  Such is diversity in college.</p>

_________________________________________________________</p>
<p>As a young man who graduated from a majority black high school, i can personally attest to that statement. When i first arrived at my new school (after having moved from a homogeneous small town high school) I was quite neutral towards matters of race, indeed i had been raised by very liberal parents, and believed in all the diversity propaganda that was thrown my way. One year in that school was enough to change my views. </p>
<p>  There was drug dealing in class, utter disrespect towards teachers and authority, people would regularly interrupt class to answer their phones, address the instructor as &#8220;bitch&#8221; frequently, there were fights daily, robberies and shootings outside the school on several occasions, the standards were lowered so low that they were borderline middle school, the black students were openly, and unashamedly racist towards the few whites and mexicans that were there, and many many more &#8220;benefits of diversity&#8221; </p>
<p>  One occasion stands out to me in particular: I was in my last class of the day, and there were several African American young women who would cause so much trouble and havoc, that the instructor would literally have to stop the lesson for 15 minutes or so and just let the class do what it wanted until they got tired of it and then would resume the lesson. One day, i had enough of it, and couldn&rsquo;t stand the constant interruptions from these young ladies any longer. Something about a chorus of &#8220;JU AINT MAH DADDY&#8221; after every instruction from the teacher can really wear on a young man&rsquo;s nerves. I approached the &#8220;leader&#8221; of this group of ladies and politely asked her why she believed she had the right to disrupt the entire class,insult the instructor at every opportunity, talk on her phone in class, and address the teacher as &#8220;bitch&#8221;. After a moment of silence after i had finished talking, the young woman went ballistic. She stuck her face into mine, and started screaming at the top of her lungs something along the lines of &#8220;You white piece of sh  &mdash; , you can&rsquo;t tell me what to do, you ain&rsquo;t my daddy, i&rsquo;m going to get my boys to cut you up and dump you in a ditch, you better learn your place whitey&#8221; And after about a minute of  racist, hateful, violent insults being thrown my way, the situation had to be calmed by one of the schools many security officers. What shocked me the most was that the administration refused to take action. This young woman was back in class within the next day. I&rsquo;m sure it goes without being said, that if a white person had said those things to a black person, the white person would no longer be attending that school and would possibly be facing a lawsuit.  <br>

Geez if the &#8220;approaches would be unworkable&#8221;?  Is that to say those approaches to not discriminate by the basis of color?  Then to that of sanctioning racially discriminatory preferences to assure under-qualified get in (often to the disadvantage of the qualified)?  </p>

		<p>This is why the SCOTUS should never have allowed any &#8220;wiggle room&#8221; - they&rsquo;ll always grab a mile for an inch granted. This use of race proxy&rsquo;s are just slight of hand in which less qualified blacks are let in place of whites just because they are black with other phony excuses given. Proof has been shown time and again by the statistics. The court needs to be clear and firm: any credit given for skin pigmentation must be ruled out. </p>

		<p>Like Anonymous 17, I also went to a majority black school at one point.  </p>
<p>I think all of us city kids, who were the minority whites, have for the most part become race realists.  Remember the idea that liberal policies have the opposite effect of their intent?  Well all of us kids who were brought in to integrate the schools, who attended magnet &#8220;arts&#8221; schools to keep us attending these schools, are now very aware of the perils of black people.  <br>
First of all, white boys were never really excepted by the majority black population.  White girls were.  That&rsquo;s because the black boys were interested sexually in them, and so they thereby also became connected with the black female population.  <br>
Females always seem to fall for &#8220;diversity&#8221; more easily than males, mostly because of the &#8220;integrating&#8221; effect of male sexual interest.  <br>
Well, this school gave the black kids everything they could have asked for. Once again, only the white kids succeeded.  There was only one black boy to graduate on honor roll, and only a couple of black girls.  The classes ended up separating into white people and select black people, and then classes with almost all black people.</p>
<p>I advocate discrimination AMONGST black people, some are bright.  They should be the chiefs of their communities, and must rule over all of their unstructured fellow blacks.  </p>

		<p>I only wish there was some way we could stand up against affirmative action besides adding our voices to a small chorus on a website blocked by many universities for &#8220;Intolerance and Hate&#8221;&hellip; right.  I noticed how the SPLC wasn&rsquo;t blocked.</p>
<p>The government is destroying the country with massive non-White immigration, oppressive taxation, removal of civil liberties, and spreading death and destruction around the world in the name of &#8220;security&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have almost lost hope.  American Renaissance is a beacon of light in a world of ignorance and darkness.  Just see how many dislikes people gave Emma West&rsquo;s video when she stood up for what is right, albeit probably not in the best way.</p>

		<p>To paraphrase Lawrence Auster, the driving concern of the liberal project is the end of America as a white country. I mean, read that line from the official documents: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Post-secondary institutions can voluntarily consider race to further the compelling interest of achieving diversity,&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Diversity is a &#8220;compelling interest&#8221;, which post-secondary schools should &#8220;volunteer&#8221; to push (which is to say, they are strongly encouraged to strive for). &#8220;Color-blindness&#8221;, the supposed ideal of the &#8220;Civil Rights Movement&#8221;, was soon unveiled to be a cover for the first strike in a racial war against White America. </p>
<p>The only people who today judge by &#8220;content of character&#8221; are patriots like Paul Kersey. </p>
<p>Jared Taylor has eloquently proven that diversity is not a strength. What he means is, it is not a strength for us and America. But that isn&rsquo;t the point: diversity isn&rsquo;t about strengthening America, but demolishing it. </p>

		<p>Affirmative action was supposed to have lasted about 10 years – just long enough to &#8220;jump start&#8221; black achievement.</p>
<p>It has long since become a form of organized crime.</p>
<p>Decent people, black, white, Hispanic, and other, must DEMAND UNIFORM standards in education and hiring, blind/anonymous admissions procedures in order to obviate discrimination against or favoritism toward any group. </p>
<p>Blacks are their own worst enemy. Their behavior, collectively and individually, is simply abominable.</p>
<p>Decent blacks are too small in number to sway the crowd - I have nothing but sympathy for them.</p>
<p>White America needs to say as bluntly as possible:</p>
<p>we will start liking and respecting blacks when they earn it.</p>
<p>We have bent over backwards for you long enough.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn to show us what you can do.</p>
<p>No more excuses, we are judging you on your behavior.</p>
<p>All accusations of racism will fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Now the shoe is on the other foot:</p>
<p>YOU need to redeem yourself in OUR eyes.</p>
<p>As far as most whites are concerned, blacks are just a dangerous nuisance.</p>
<p>If you want to change our minds, you got your work cut out for you.</p>
<p>Hop to it!!</p>

		<p>#24 - &#8220;So what, all this means is more unqualified blacks will go to collage and flunk out. Than owe a ton of student loans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong!  Blacks normally get full scholarships, esp. if they are accepted into good colleges.  Blacks can get into Harvard with an 1100 SAT (something that&rsquo;s a total failure for an Asian or White student) and then they don&rsquo;t have to pay for it.  Either they flunk out or (more likely) they get a degree in a can&rsquo;t-fail field like African American Studies, education, sociology, that kind of thing.  The whole point of African American studies departments is to create a can&rsquo;t-fail major, because blacks would never be able to graduate in STEM (science technology engineering math) fields, and would struggle to graduate in humanities fields.</p>
<p>I majored in hard sciences at a very very competitive university, one of the very top in the world in this particular hard science field, and there were ZERO blacks in any of my classes, despite a strong AA program that brought a lot of blacks onto campus. They were all major in mickey mouse things like African American studies.</p>
<p>This has a whole bunch of harmful effects, on the students who didn&rsquo;t get in, on the blacks who did get in, on the taxpayers, and on erosion of the value of a Harvard degree itself.  If I see Dontavius Jones with a degree from Harvard, I know it&rsquo;s not a real degree.</p>
<p>Let it end.  Oh please let it end.  When will we wake up.</p>

		<p>Nobody has been hoodwinked by diversity initiatives. Maybe a greater percentage of white females, because they benefit. But no white guy I have a conversation w at work or at a bar or in line at the donut shop believes much differently than we do. Even my liberal professors : they play the game like we do. </p>

		<p>&#8220;American Renaissance is a beacon of light in a world of ignorance and darkness&#8221;.</p>
<p>American Renaissance comes up &#8216;blocked&rsquo; at many libraries i&rsquo;ve been too. The reason or tag-word used has been &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;. AmRen is across the border on many issue (tho it&rsquo;s usually simply members of the general public making posts), but AmRen seems to be against affirmative action (at least for people of color). Affirmative action is discrimination. So a group opposing discrimination gets blocked because of &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;&hellip; That works out for those who are genuinely discriminating</p>
