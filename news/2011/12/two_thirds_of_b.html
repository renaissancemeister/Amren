<h1>Two Thirds of Britons Say Immigration Has a Negative Effect on the UK</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angus Reid Public Opinion, December 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three-in-five respondents believe illegal immigrants who are currently working should be required to leave their jobs and be deported.</p>
<p>A feeling of animosity towards both legal and illegal immigrants has exacerbated in Britain, a new Angus Reid Public Opinion poll has found.</p>
<p>In the online survey of a representative sample of 2,006 adults, 69 per cent of respondents think immigration is having a negative effect on the UK.</p>
<p>Seven-in-ten Britons (72%) would like to decrease the number of legal immigrants who are allowed to relocate in the United Kingdom. A majority of respondents in all three age groups agree with this course of action, including 52 per cent of those aged 18-to-34.</p>
<p>Illegal immigration remains a concern for respondents as well, with 58 per cent of Britons (+4 since 2009) saying that these immigrants take jobs away from UK workers, and 61 per cent calling for their deportation. Only one-in-five respondents (20%) would consent to a system that would allow illegal immigrants to work in the UK on temporary basis, but without becoming citizens.</p>

		<p>Culturalcolonialism should be given the heave-ho; it won&rsquo;t though they should because the class that benefits from immigration is the class that politicians come from.  David Cameron, the British prime-minister has a Nepalese nanny who was formerly an illegal.</p>

		<p>Question is&hellip;. do they dare say these things in public and risk being hunted down like Emma West, arrested, have their children taken away and denied bail for a while? Sorry Britian, but I don&rsquo;t think your government gives one wit what you think or want, just as ours don&rsquo;t in the USA.</p>

<p>But yet these &#8220;three in five&#8221; will ignore the BNP and continue to vote for the very people that keep bringing them in, much like the people in this country do.</p>

		<p>Tim McHugh # has said it all, simply and quite humourously but the message is deadly serious. That 33% will soon be 51%, a &#8220;critical mass&#8221; that will take the England we once all so fondly remember past the point of no return.</p>
<p>Here in Oz the most quoted figure for opposition to 3rd World/Asian/Islamic/Afro immigration is 86% against.</p>
<p>If we question government immigration policy the stock reply goes something like this:</p>
<p>1, Australia has a totally non-racial immigration policy.(Were the Australian people ever consulted on this? (Never)</p>
<p>2, We have an obligation under United Nations conventions to take these people in. Again these conventions were ratified without any public discussion or consultation. The UN is an unelected body and is both left leaning and dominated by Islamic (about 50 members)  African, Asian and other 3rd World, eg. Latin America, members. Of course they are going to take an anti-West position on these matters.</p>
<p>3, Most people here are frightened to say to much about immigration policy for fear of being branded &#8220;racist&#8221; or coming to the attention of the Thought Police. I am not joking, Australia has draconian racial vilification laws which effectively stop any free speech on immigration policy.</p>
<p>But back to the original post, the fact that this survey has even been published would suggest a possible increasing public awareness of and opposition to inappropriate immigration to the West. This can only be good.</p>

		<p>Reply to #7:</p>
<p>1) Australia SHOULD have a policy based on race. This is what the people want. In any case preference is not prejudice and immigration is only a privilege, not a right.</p>
<p>2) The United Nations has been a curse on all the western countries of the world since the day that crypto-internationalist FDR created it. It has been used as an endless excuse to flood white countries with riff-raff from the third world. I can&rsquo;t think of any good it has ever done the west at all. We should withdraw from it. We would all be better off. Note how Japan doesn&rsquo;t get suckered into taking in &#8220;refugees&#8221;. </p>
<p>3) They want to muzzle people so that nobody will be able to do anything about it. We musn&rsquo;t let this happen. </p>

		<p>Last summer&rsquo;s riots have probably done a lot to increase the number of people who oppose Third World immigration. Not to mention the other assorted violent crimes, like the 96-year-old man who was attacked in the tram. </p>

		<p>Turning opinion into votes means (1) prioritising &#8220;ethnic issues&#8221; above &#8220;bread-and-butter&#8221;, (2) money for candidates and effective organisation to beat opponents, and (3) media access in face of &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; legislation in the UK and other EU satrapies (e.g. the forthcoming show trial of the England Football Captain for &#8220;a racially aggravated public order offence&#8221;, i.e. allegedly alluding to an opponent&rsquo;s &#8220;colour&#8221; in an - otherwise apparently acceptable - exclamation during a match).<br>
AmRen is probably a good place for WNs to discuss practicable proposals across the board.</p>

<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>-7  &mdash;  GM (Australia) please become a strong immigration restrictionist for Australia. With just a little fine tuning you can make your message very receptive to the public and escape government persecution. Just finesse the racial issue a bit instead of loudly calling for the return of the &#8220;White Australia immigration policy&#8221; support something like &#8220;lower numbers, more traditional immigration (British White)&#8221;. In you blogs and literature have lots of articles about science, nature, which you can fall back on when Antis try to silence you. And make the Islamic extremist the #1 propaganda immigration enemy. The Liberals/Left can&rsquo;t really make any case that Australia will benefit by being flooded by men that want to kill gays, take away women&rsquo;s rights that sort of thing.</p>

		<p>So much for democracy. So many died thinking they were fighting to preserve Britain&rsquo;s integrity, independence and democracy. Shame we no longer have any of those things. We don&rsquo;t even have a right to free speech. We&rsquo;re being colonised by the million, by the dregs of the third world. Our assets have been carved up and sold to the highest bidders, usually foreign, all this aided and abetted by our own treacherous self-serving &#8216;elite&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Immigration is a way of life. Irrespective of the growing opposition to immigration including so called &#8220;3rd world&#8221; immigration.</p>
<p>The funny thing: so called &#8220;3rd world&#8221; entrepreneurs, scientists, academicians and artistes are already beating the white Britons in their own traditional spheres of dominance. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>1. The wealthiest man in the UK is an Indian citizen (not even a British citizen, but has resident status in the UK)-Lakshmi Mittal owns the world&rsquo;s largest steel-iron corporation. He is also the owner of Britain&rsquo;s most expensive house - &#8220;The Taj&#8221; at the posh Kensington place, London. He is opening the world&rsquo;s biggest Artic ore mine and is building the tallest tower in the UK along with Anish Kapoor, another Indian business tycoon &amp; architect.</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/AIi03" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/AIi03</a></p>
<p>2. The Indian business giant TATA now owns Britain&rsquo;s largest Steel company Corus and what used to be the pride of Britain&rsquo;s Auto Industry-Jaguar-Land Rover.</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/YxH5T" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/YxH5T</a></p>
<p>3. Another &#8220;3rd world&#8221; Indian (Mehta) now owns Britain&rsquo;s greatest company, one which funded &amp; carried out ALL her colonial operations, conquests &amp; financing/ shipping- The East India Company. Essentially the pride of Great Britain is now under an Indian ( once a colonial subject of the former, how ironic!)</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/OwBa3" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/OwBa3</a></p>
<p>4. The world&rsquo;s greatest Cardio-Thoracic surgeon is an immigrant from &#8220;3rd world&#8221; Egypt - Sir (Dr) Yusef Magdi.</p>
<p>5. Britain&rsquo;s largest &amp; most celebrated shopping center in London is owned by another &#8220;3rd worlder&#8221; from Egypt: Mohammad Al Fayed!</p>
<p>6. &#8220;3rd world&#8221; Indian &amp; Chinese immigrant children outperform white Briton to top ALL academic scores in high school &amp; college ( Cambridge GCSE)</p>

		<p>Reply to Chess from London at # 15:</p>
<p>&#8220;Immigration is a way of life&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Make that immigration to white, western countries is a way of life. The black, brown and yellow countries of the world are having nothing of it. Also, far from being a &#8216;way of life&rsquo;, it is ENDING the way of life, westerners enjoyed for centuries.</p>
<p>As for your points 1 though 5, you casually cherrypick a few examples that basically proves nothing at all. What about the massive black crime in Britain? Or all the muslims on welfare? How about the Tottenham race riots? Or a hundred others? Or the 7/7 suicide bombings in London? Any &#8220;gain&#8221; from immigration is hugely outweighed by the costs. </p>
<p>As for point 6, if the British state paid half the time, effort and money on the native British, that they do mollycuddling ethnics, test scores would hugely improve. </p>

		<p>To poster no. 16,</p>
<p>All organisms migrate towards greener pastures. Humans have ALWAYS migrated towards placed with a favourable outcome, which would include food, resources, climatic conditions, natural resources, water, fertile soil, wealth etc. Europeans went around the world ravaging foreign lands in Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas&hellip;.they went there for opportunities. Well, the roosters have come home to roost. People from the &#8220;3rd world&#8221; are obviously migrating to western nations, which are wealthy. Nothing sinful about it or as you Americans say: human socio-anthropology 101 in action!</p>
<p>You obviously have not lived in England. Asian children are more intelligent &amp; perform far better than their white counterparts, without receiving ANY aid or affirmative action from the government. When I mean Asians, I meant only the Indians &amp; Chinese NOT Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, South East Asians etc.</p>
