			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lydia Warren and Michael Zennie, Daily Mail (London), December 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man suspected of spraying a 73-year-old woman with gasoline and setting her on fire in an elevator has been charged with murder and arson.</p>
<p>Jerome Isaac, from New York, said nothing as he appeared in court yesterday with the left side of his face badly burned and peeling. He is being held without bail.</p>
<p>His lawyer requested the 47-year-old be placed in solitary confinement and receive medical attention for his burns.</p>
<p>Police say Isaac is a disgruntled handyman who was so angry that Delores Gillespie, a former employer, had failed to pay a $2,000 bill that he killed her on Saturday.</p>
<p>He was yesterday charged with first-degree murder and arson, hours after he turned himself in to police reeking of gasoline with the entire left-side of his face clearly singed by flames.</p>
<p>Isaac waited for Ms Gillespie to return to her Brooklyn home from shopping. When the elevator door opened, he sprayed gasoline across her face and body before setting her on fire with a Molotov cocktail, according to police.</p>
<p>The elderly woman cowered in the corner of the elevator and tried to shield herself, but neighbours said they heard her screams of agony as she burned to death while her alleged killer fled the scene.</p>
<p>Isaac had lived with Ms Gillespie while he worked for her doing odd jobs, according to reports.</p>
<p>When Ms Gillespie found out Isaac was stealing from her, she fired him, Rickey Causey, the victim&rsquo;s 52-year-old nephew, told the New York Post. </p>
<p>&#8216;He was doing more stealing than cleaning,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Isaac left a note on Ms Gillespie&rsquo;s door demanding payment for chores he had done, but the elderly woman didn&rsquo;t want to pay him after she caught him taking things from her, Mr Causey said.</p>
<p>The horrifying attack lasted one minute and was caught on two surveillance cameras at the apartment block.</p>
<p>Ms Gillespie, who had just returned from grocery shopping, turned and crouched in an attempt to protect herself, according to police.</p>
<p>But Isaac, who was wearing a protective mask on top of his head, sprayed her directly in the face and over her head and body as she retreated to the back of the elevator, it is claimed.</p>
<p>He then pulled out a long, barbecue-style lighter and used it to ignite a rag in a bottle.</p>
<p>Isaac waited for a few seconds before using the flames to set her alight and throwing the bottle inside the lift, according to police.</p>
<p>The attacker ran away, using the apartment block&rsquo;s staircase, leaving the woman to die in agony.</p>
<p>Ms Gillespie, who neighbours believe grew up in Louisiana and suffered a mental illness, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Police said they believe Isaac had been waiting for Ms Gillespie to return home.</p>
<p>&#8216;It was apparent he knew she was on the elevator,&rsquo; New York City police spokesman Paul Browne said.</p>
<p>Firefighters and the police arrived at the apartment block at 4pm after residents reported fire and smoke  &mdash;  but remained unaware of the elevator horror.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;ve never seen any s*** like this, and I&rsquo;ve been doing this a long time,&rsquo; an unnamed detective added.</p>
<p>Neighbours described their shock at the terrifying incident, which occurred on the building&rsquo;s fifth floor, where Ms Gillespie had lived &#8216;for years&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m in shock,&rsquo; neighbour Chris Martinez, 38, told the Daily News. &#8216;We didn&rsquo;t know she had any enemies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had often complained other tenants were stealing from her  &mdash;  yet neighbours believed she was simply paranoid.</p>
<p>Her son had been staying with her in recent months. Another neighbour said the woman was a postal worker.</p>
<p>One neighbour, who identified himself to the Daily News as &#8216;John&rsquo;, said he heard loud screams before smoke started filling the hallways.</p>
<p>&#8216;It was high-pitched yelling,&rsquo; he said. He then ran downstairs and heard &#8216;popping sounds&rsquo; from the elevator shaft.</p>
<p>&#8216;The elevator sounded like it was boiling paint,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;You could see the flames in the elevator shaft and hear crackling,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>Five other people were hurt in the fire, but none were seriously injured.</p>

		<p>This atrocity made me think of the tragedy Frank Lloyd Wright&rsquo;s family, co-workers, and servants endured on August 15, 1914 while he was away on business.  According to the Wiki article, &#8220;a male servant from Barbados who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of Taliesin [the Wright family residence] and murdered seven people with an axe as the fire burned.&#8221; The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>

		<p>If were in my power, I would give Jerome Isaacs an IQ test shortly before feeding him to Nile crocodiles. I suspect his score would be well under 85. He&rsquo;s just smart enough to plan such an atrocity, but far too stupid to consider the consequences. I&rsquo;ve been trying a mental excercise to imagine what &#8216;calculations&rsquo; went through Mr Isaac&rsquo;s head leading up to the crime: &#8216;dat ol&rsquo; &#8216;blank&rsquo; owes muh tootousand dollas&rsquo;&hellip;.then I realize I can&rsquo;t imagine what a low level he operates on. Too dumb to wear a mask! He probably walked past the security cameras every day. He alleges the women owes him $2000, he murders her in the most cold-hearted and depraved fashion imaginable, and now will get life in prison plus a nice ugly scar as a bonus. </p>

		<p>This reminds me of the case of where a black ex husband of a white woman with their two mulatto children were burned up by the husband in a car they were traveling in.The two children died. He and her were severely burned.The jury spared him the death penalty, because of a couple of black jurors.She was on the Oprah Winfrey Show.</p>

		<p>This is a black-on-black crime and doesn&rsquo;t directly concern us, but it is nevertheless a horrible way for an elderly lady to meet her end. May God rest her soul. <br>
We need to be aware that there are feral beasts out there who have no qualms about doing things like this. If they treat their own kind this way, it is a foregone conclusion that they will treat white people as bad if not worse, given how much they hate and resent us. It is also telling that an elderly woman was attacked and killed in such a horrible way. It is most often the defenseless  &mdash;  elderly, handicapped, children, or women alone  &mdash;  that are attacked. </p>

		<p>Peejay- There was a similar story in Oklahoma City almost 20 years ago. The mom was either dating or being stalked by a black man who threw gasoline on her and her (White) daughter and set them on fire. I tend to think that he was stalking her since she was a professional and he seemed to be a very low IQ loser. Long story short, the mom died a few days later and the daughter was terribly disfigured. The moral to this one would be to keep a far distance from black men if you are a White woman- don&rsquo;t have more than a professional level conversation with them. </p>

		<p>It would be interesting to see how other blacks respond to this incident.  Usually, it&rsquo;s with laughter.</p>
<p>I first encountered this when the movie, New Jack City opened in Chicago.  I was the only white person in the audience.  It was very strange how they would all laugh at extremely inappropriate times.</p>
<p>Years later, reading the Turner Diaries, there is a scene where an old black woman is tied to a chair on top of a car to be sent back east with other blacks from liberated California.  She falls off, cracks her skull on the road and dies.  The surrounding blacks laugh hysterically.  It suddenly dawned on me, something that many hard core racists don&rsquo;t even know (but Pierce knew).  Blacks find cruelty, inhumanity, and the suffering of others, even their own to be hilarious.  Something satanic and unthinkable by whites.  And by blacks I mean ALL blacks, not just a few bad apples.  This is what they are.</p>
<p>Since then, I see this everywhere.  Recently, I learned that it is hard to get anyone in Africa to do anything about suffering of blacks because they think it&rsquo;s white people&rsquo;s responsibility only.  More to the point, film of starving blacks and other intense suffering, including things like that video of blacks being burned to death causes a universal response&hellip;..hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this guy did this.  He could have simply shot her or beaten her.  If it really was about money, he would have stolen from her.  No&hellip;.what he was after was the approval of other blacks.  Which he will get a full measure of in prison.</p>

		<p>Maybe low IQ is not the only factor.<br>
Some criminologists are considering whether there is a low empathy factor in the brains of violent criminals, notably any predisposed to burning victims or buildings. Not quite the same thing as sadism or pleasure in inflicting torture, which might paradoxically suggest a capacity for empathy.<br>
If so, there may be a differential distribution across various population groups.<br>
Drugs also surely play a part (George Soros &amp; Ron Paul, please note).<br>

		<p>Anon 2:15- not just blacks but any low IQ minority. My exhusband was from the Middle East (looked as White as any Middle Easterner could) and he enjoyed especially violent and gruesome movies. Many times he would laugh and rewind a particularly disturbing scene and laugh hysterically. One particularly chilling episode was a scene where the wrong house is subject to a police raid and a man was accidentally shot and killed. The man&rsquo;s traumatized wife is screaming and the cop yelled &#8220;shut up&#8221; at her. For some reason this tickled his funny bone and he rewinded it several times before going on with the movie. I knew this was really not normal and said something- he glared at me and said &#8220;some people deserve far worse&#8221;. He didnt say who and I didnt ask. Teach your kids to stay away from minorities! </p>

		<p>This behavior is not limited to blacks. A white man here in California set his own son on fire to get back at his ex. There was mass horror at the crime and the anger was not limited to whites. One of the black players on the golden state warrior basketball team hosted the poor burned boy at a game. Once, the father, who was released from prison way too soon, came into the library where I worked and our custodians, hispanic and black, could barely restrain themselves from killing the evil bastard. I am sure he met a lot of minorities in jail and out who wanted to kill him.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m a white and I laughed all the way during John Carpenter&rsquo;s &#8220;The Thing.&#8221; The one that came out in the 80&rsquo;s.  My brother was terrified by the movie and was amazed that I laughed so much.  I guess it was nervousness on my part.  I no longer go to see gory/horror movies. They turn my stomach now.</p>

		<p>There are several anecdotal reports of black audiences laughing at suffering on screen; for instance, a reliable friend told me of his shock at this response in a cinema to a horrifying scene of the Crucifixion. But there is also something like &#8220;nervous laughter&#8221; which may be excessive in their case, especially if aggravated by personal instability and group excitement. Close objective research is impossible at present (though see Richard Lynn on race &amp; psychopathy). However, it seems unfair and inaccurate to generalise: what about black nurses, doctors and voluntary aid workers?</p>
<p>Humour, especially the joke, largely depends on unexpected or sudden anomaly, often with delight in the misfortune of others; Chesterton cited the pompous policeman whose helmet is knocked off. The famous humorist - and, incidentally, famous &#8220;racist&#8221; - Dr Stephen Leacock developed this notion with a comedian describing a man with a top hat being pelted by snowballs: audience laughter slowly subsided as the man was gradually buried helplessly under the snow. Would different races react differently?</p>
<p>My I finish with a true &#8220;moral to the story&#8221;? In the 1980s plans were afoot to rename a former girls&rsquo; grammar school in Leyton, an outer London town with a large new multi-racial intake, &#8220;The Winnie Mandela High School&#8221;. As you know, Nozamo Winifred Madikizela-Mandela publicly supported &#8220;necklacing&#8221; whereby black opponents in South Africa were slowly burned alive.  Reportedly his project of local leftists was narrowly voted down by school governors; which was perhaps a pity, because no sooner than the change would have taken place, this &#8220;Mother of the Rainbow Nation&#8221; was personally implicated in the brutal murder of a school-child called Stompie Seipei! The &#8220;joke&#8221; would have then been on the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; coterie, and a different lesson would have been provided for us all.   </p>

		<p><i>A white man here in California set his own son on fire to get back at his ex.</i><p>I remember that case - it happened almost 30 years ago: the father&rsquo;s name was Charles Rothenberg, he was an ex-convict in 1983 when he committed the act, and my info is that he&rsquo;s gone back to prison where he remains on a &#8220;third strike&#8221; felony conviction. See, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/79lllqv" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/79lllqv</a> There was indeed outrage at the atrocity, in part (I&rsquo;m certain) because white people so rarely perpetrate such horrendous crimes, despite being proportionately more of the population.<p>Meanwhile, let me cite yet another such black-on-black burning incident occurring in 1997, especially remarkable because the lionized Malcolm X&rsquo;s grandson Malcolm Shabazz set a fire that burnt his 63 year old caretaker and own grandmother Betty Shabazz horribly - she suffered for weeks before she finally died of burns over 80% of her body.  Like Jerry Isaac, the young miscreant wandered the streets afterward, reeking of gasoline.  He told the police after they picked him up that he started a fire to somehow convince his grandmother to let him go back to live with his mother. Instead, it got him a trip to and long stay at a juvenile correctional facility.  He&rsquo;s been in trouble with the law since his release from there, for things like attempted robbery, but is now reportedly seeking &#8220;redemption.&#8221;  Even were he not Malcolm X&rsquo;s grandson, he would assuredly get that from his own community; by contrast, no amount of effort by Charles Rothenberg will redeem him in the sight of any community. So much for your attempt at &#8220;moral equivalence.&#8221;</p></p></p>

		<p>#5 Dutch - Actually think his intelligence or reasoning power were not the issue exactly.<br>
There is no death penalty in NY.<br>
He will from now on receive free room, board, medical, and perhaps even find a nice niche of friend who will ask him repeatedly to talk about his deed. He to some may be a hero.<br>
Most importantly, he will savor those moments when his most significant act on earth occurred. <br>
Now if he could be fed to a larger beast that enjoys live prey<br>
, then.. then this would be a better world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rothenberg&#8221; is a common Jewish surname.  </p>

<p>We commit plenty of atrocities of our OWN against our OWN without having to be blamed for those we aren&rsquo;t guilty of such as our federal and state Leviathan&rsquo;s curious habit of lumping in Hispanics-as-Whites in compilations of White crime statistics to falsely INFLATE and thus propagandize White crime rates, but give THEM a category (home) of their own when calculating crimes committed against THEM.  </p>
<p>WHO put such virulent anti-White policies into place?  The usual culprits I am sure.   </p>
