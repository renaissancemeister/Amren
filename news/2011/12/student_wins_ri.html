			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Don Logana, WTOC, December 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Last month, the Confederate battle flag whipped up controversy on the campus of University of South Carolina at Beaufort.</p>
<p>One student fought for the right to hang the Confederate flag in his dorm room window.</p>
<p>Not a white student. A black student fought for what he says he believes in.</p>
<p>18 year-old Byron Thomas, a North Augusta, SC native and freshman at USCB, is African American. He wants the right to hang the flag in his dorm room window. </p>
<p>After multiple complaints, Thomas was told the flag must come out of the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me it is a heritage thing and a pride thing. It is not a racist thing whatsoever,&#8221; Thomas told WTOC.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas decided to do something he couldn&rsquo;t do at home. &#8220;No sir, because my parents have strong feelings about it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He hung the Confederate flag in his dorm room window for the rest of his peers, with a courtyard view, to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;There would have been a serious problem if I had done it in my house,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m 18 now. I should have my own right to believe how I want to believe about things.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By November, the housing staff at USCB told Thomas the flag must come down.</p>
<p>&#8220;They never told me people were complaining. They said I was violating a racism code,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>&#8220;We received about 20 to 24 complaints,&#8221; Doug Oblander, Vice-Chancellor of Student Development at University of South Carolina at Beaufort, told WTOC. &#8220;When they open their windows to let the sun in, they look directly into this flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After an appeal by Thomas, along with national attention and a review by university lawyers, Thomas was told Thursday morning it had been recommended by counsel that he be allowed to put the flag back up.</p>
<p>&#8220;It probably is an infringement of his First Amendment rights,&#8221; Oblander said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As of Thursday night, the flag is back. </p>
<p>&#8220;That flag means to me southern heritage. I love the south. I&rsquo;ve always lived in the south. Everything about the south, to me, is great,&#8221; Thomas said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Drink some hard core caffeine drink before you watch.  He&rsquo;s black and 19, so these aren&rsquo;t exactly eloquent and riveting apologetics on par with Alexander Stephens.</p>
<p>Of all the things that college students do to themselves and each other in the &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; of dorm rooms, especially black students, (use your imagination), they&rsquo;re having a big damned cow over a Confederate Battle Flag?</p>
<p>The Blaze version of this story has this:</p>
<p><i>A class project made him come to the realization that the flag&rsquo;s real meaning has been hijacked, he told the Associated Press in an interview. He said he wants people to carefully consider issues of race and not just have knee-jerk reactions to symbols.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat encouraging that there&rsquo;s at least one Professor in one class at the University of South Carolina system that isn&rsquo;t preaching hatred against Things Southern, and whoever teaches it is so good at it that s/he is getting blacks on his or her side. I hope that Prof has tenure.</p>

		<p>As an Englishman I found the South uniquely pleasant, black &amp; white. I put it down to the presence of Bible based Christianity &amp; conservative politics throughout the Confederate states. The South is a beacon to the world so fly that Stars &amp; Bars with pride. It represents what is wholesome, no wonder the liberal left hate it so much.</p>

		<p>With so many black people condemning the Confederate flag as a symbol of slavery and racism, I would be greatly interested to hear the viewpoint of those black people, like Byron Thomas, who proudly and gladly fly the Confederate flag.</p>

		<p>I do not know of a single conservative southerner who supports slavery.  They fly their Confederate flags as a symbol of southern pride and independence.  Of course it helps that the flag upsets liberal northerners so.  At least one southern black man agrees.<br>

<p>No #$&% Captain Obvious. My questions are, would he see it as an infringement of a White student&rsquo;s rights if the White were told to remove a Confederate Flag hanging in his dorm room and would the White be &#8220;allowed&#8221; to keep his flag hanging??</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t &#8216;jump the shark&rsquo; mean &#8216;reach the point where decline begins&rsquo;? The reference is to an old episode of Happy Days wherein Fonzie waterski-jumped a shark. This was later seen as the point where the show had just passed the point of peak creative invention (having to resort to cheap spectacle) and began its decline.</p>

		<p>#1 &amp; #2 make good points, but I think that the matter goes a bit farther. Blacks are socially perceptive. Thomas is probably displaying the Confederate Flag to show that he can do something that white men cannot do. Thus he is asserting his social superiority. </p>

		<p>This may have merely been a way for this student to gain national attention, or it could have been a gesture from the heart.  Either way, such actions are advantageous for black people.  As a group, they can&rsquo;t hope to achieve the respect of other ethnicities if they continue to carp and whine about race-based concerns.  <br>
White liberals are probably the folks responsible for making the Confederate flag a symbol of slavery and racism.  Blacks would do themselves a huge favor by ignoring it, as Jews would by ignoring the flying of a Nazi flag.  People don&rsquo;t just look at either banner and become hate-filled zombies!<br>
When someone in the U.S. flies a British flag, does anyone start wailing about colonialism and claim that the flier wants the nation to rejoin Britain?  </p>

		<p>I doubt this applies to Byron Thomas, but someone very involved in the Southern Heritage fight once told me that there is a small percentage of blacks who display CBFs as a pure statement of &#8220;screw you world&#8221; and rebellion against whatever pebble is in their shoes.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m opposed to politicizing symbols of Southern heritage and nationhood, or reducing them to base human emotions such as &#8220;rebellion.&#8221;  The Confederate Battle Flag, and all the other Dixieron flags, are symbols of a particular group of ethnically related people in a particular place.</p>

<p>I grew up in the North in a  middle class, upper middle class environment. Most of the people I was surrounded with had no problem with the Confederate Flag. Many of them liked the flag. I saw it in many dens, bedrooms and dorm rooms. Not all Northerners are the same person. There are annoying white liberals in both the North and the South. Most whites in this country do not have civil war ancestry. The old rivalry shouldn&rsquo;t even be an issue.<br>

		<p>My wife and I are English but we live in France. we have spent time visiting my sister in Arkansas, the people we met there were very friendly and welcoming as well as being extremely polite. Don&rsquo;t let the PC brigade stop you from flying the Confederate flag it&rsquo;s part of your heritage, our doctor who is French and speaks perfect English spends much of his holidays with his southern friends in Virginia and is very knowledgeable about southern history. In his surgery here in France he has a large Confederate Flag pinned to the wall. In England we have the same problem with our flag the cross of St George, a red cross on a white back ground which is according to the PC brigade a racist flag and might offend ethnic minorities who are rapidly becoming the majority through unlimited third world immigration and out breeding whites by five to one.  Many faint hearted English people wont fly their eight hundred year old national flag on St George&rsquo;s day April 23 for fear of being branded a racist. </p>

		<p>The idea of the Stars and Bars being a symbol of white supremacy <br>
can be instantly demolished by the fact that it is known that blacks did serve in the Confederate Army, mainly as cooks and teamsters, and occasionally took up arms against the Yankee invaders. Lochlain Seabrook in his book A Rebel Born asserts that Nathan Bedford Forrest recruited blacks into his unit, a year or more before the CS congress approved the enlistment of blacks, and that they served along side whites. In the late 1800s and early 1900s there were blacks who were members of the United Confederate  Veterans. </p>
<p>There are also stories of slaves remaining on plantations during Sherman&rsquo;s depredations and helping white families protect family treasures and heirlooms. These relationships sometimes lasted for generations after the end of the war with families maintaining relationships with descendants of the family slaves.</p>
<p>Of course those good feelings were destroyed during the course of<br>
reconstruction,and latter, the Civil Rights movement and the implementation of the welfare state.</p>
<p>It is estimated that fifty percent of all native born southerners can claim Confederate ancestry which is why heritage organizations like the SCV and UDC are still active today.</p>
<p>There have been efforts by SCV leadership to recruit black members and promote the history of black Confederates, but I have been opposed to those moves because of the continued assaults on Confederate heritage and the inequality that exists when it comes to issues like the flag. </p>

		<p>Unless this is a white man standing strong against political correctness, I&rsquo;m not going to feel like we&rsquo;re advancing.  It takes women (like Emma White) or minorities to say and do what white men are to because the average white man today is a politically correct neutered whimp. Sorry to be so harsh, but that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>

		<p>It is at least tangentially relevant to note that during the<br>
Great Rebellion (1861-65)/ War for Southern Independence / <br>
thousands of Blacks were in front line duty during the waning<br>
months of the conflict  &mdash;  if not fully armed (were there some such?), in support duties as teamsters, wagonmasters, cooks, medics, etc.  It is not unreasonable to assume that abler Blacks<br>
understood the conflict to have in reality little to do with race and even less to do with authentic Black liberation.  In a sense, a Black youth flying the Battle Flag is perhaps appealing to the need for an authentic contemporary history of that War.??  </p>

Your comment and information fascinates me.  My own filmy notion<br>
of this is that a great deal of what was done to allow Blacks<br>
to serve in the military during the waning phase of the War, was<br>
done in &#8220;ears only&#8221; communication, as the issue<br>
of use of Blacks in the Confederate forces was hugely controversial.  I have wondered if historians at, or in an adivsory capacity to, West Point, or within DoD, for that matter, have located whatever primary source material may exist (diaries, personal histories, contents of personal letters, etc. )?  Your information is the first indication I have had that some Blacks were actually armed and in full combat roles. If<br>
I remember correctly, the offical &#8220;green light&#8221; in the Confederate Congress was given to Black recruitment only weeks before the surrender in April 1965?  Too little, too late?  </p>
