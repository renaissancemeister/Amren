<h1>Chicago Hospital Opens Doors to Undocumented Immigrants</h1>
 

<p>Fox News Latino, December 29, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Pro-immigrant activists in Chicago are celebrating a &#8220;Christmas miracle&#8221; after an area hospital said it will provide free treatment for undocumented immigrants lacking health insurance, including several who need urgent organ transplants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Rev. Jos√© Landaverde, pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Anglican Mission], members of his congregation and other religious groups, as well as activists fighting to unite families separated by deportations, held a Christmas &#8220;posada&#8221; ceremony on Sunday at Rush University Medical Center.</p>
<p>After walking for two hours, participants prayed the rosary at the hospital entrance to recall Mary and Joseph&rsquo;s search for lodging before the birth of Jesus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Landaverde said that at least five undocumented families could benefit immediately, although a formal agreement has not yet been signed.</p>
<p>Rush&rsquo;s promise to help, he said, &#8220;will put pressure on other hospitals, who cannot now deny (medical) attention to undocumented people with serious illnesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the cases mentioned is that of Marcela Ortiz, 37, who suffers from leukemia and needs a $100,000 bone marrow transplant.</p>
<p>Also, brothers Elfego and Lorenzo Arroyo, both in their mid-30s, suffer from a rare hereditary illness known as amyloidosis and need liver transplants.</p>
