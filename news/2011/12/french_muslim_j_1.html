<h1>French Muslim Jailed for Punching Nurse Who Tried to Remove Wife&rsquo;s Burqa During Childbirth</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Muslim man who punched a nurse for trying to remove his wife&rsquo;s burqa during childbirth has been jailed in France.</p>
<p>Nassim Mimoune, 24, had already been expelled from the delivery room for branding the midwife a &#8216;rapist&rsquo; as she carried out an intimate examination of his wife.</p>
<p>Then through a window he spotted the nurse taking off his wife&rsquo;s burqa as she prepared to give birth.</p>
<p>He smashed open the locked door and hit the woman in the face, demanding she replace the full Islamic face veil.</p>
<p>As his wife delivered a baby boy, Mimoune was ejected from the building by security men from the hospital in Marseille and arrested for assault.</p>
<p>A judge in the southern French port jailed Mimoune for six months on Wednesday, telling him: &#8216;Your religious values are not superior to the laws of the republic.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I actually find this quite surprising because usually Muslims do not object to have their wives examined by a female doctor or midwife and it is usually permissible for women who are in a room with no men around to remove their Muslim scarves and burkas. These people should be deported because obviously they cannot assimilate into French society.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a burqa joke told by Islam expert Robert Spencer:</p>
<p>Recently I was in a supermarket and there was a young Muslim boy, probably about 4 or 5, and he got separated from his mother, and he was weeping and he was finally taken to the manager of the supermarket, and the manager said, &#8216;well what does your mother look like&rsquo; and the boy said &#8216;I have no idea&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Does anyone remember a magical time when 24 year old white men were having kids with their wives?  </p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t happen much any more.  These young white men have been priced out of family formation; in part because they have to pay to fill the nurseries with &#8220;monster children&#8221;.  Also, these young white men frankly can&rsquo;t find proper white female wives and mothers.  So many white women spend their most fertile years having flings with various &#8220;bad boys&#8221;; many of whom are &#8220;minorities&#8221; who will never pay a cent for the illegitimate spawn they produce with out liberated white women.  Of course, the white guy our liberated gal turned down WILL have to pay for her and Tyrone/Juan/Muhammad&rsquo;s child.  I can hardly imagine a more criminal and evil society.</p>
<p>I submit the multiculturalism and open borders could never have occurred without women&rsquo;s &#8220;equality&#8221;.  Make of that what you will.</p>

		<p>&#8220;French Muslim Jailed for Punching Nurse Who Tried to Remove Wife&rsquo;s Burqa During Childbirth&#8221;</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s problems are FAR, FAR worse regarding Muslims than just punching a nurse.</p>
<p>There are many &#8220;no go&#8221; zones of Africans and Muslims where even the police are reluctant to enter, and a normal night across France records about 100 cars burned on average, with thousands burned during uprisings.</p>
<p>Like multicultural populations throughout the West that are no more than tinder boxes just waiting for a spark to ignite them, France is in dire straits more so than the average.</p>
<p>There are no solutions to the self-induced multi-country problems except segregation or deportations.  Since neither will occur voluntarily, the West is in danger of large scale conflicts, especially as the global economy continues to tank. Instead of social benefit cutbacks, funds will dry up altogether.</p>

<p>Because housing is too expensive in many parts of the country.  Yet, most politicians of most stripes in both parties are trying to tell us that housing isn&rsquo;t expensive enough.  Some even want to grant green cards to foreigners who buy &#8220;expensive&#8221; ($500K+) houses, and in some parts of the country, a half megabuck house is not much bigger than a sardine box.  Of course, those Utah and New York politicians proposing this are responding to their big money constituents in Manhattan and Park City who want their own real estate values to keep going up and up.</p>

<p>I agree with you.  Our immigration and &#8220;Diversity&#8221; policies seem to be in direct correlation to the increase of women in governing and power roles in American government and society.  We can talk about the past corruption of the white male dominated society, but at least it was stable.</p>

		<p>From about 700 AD to 1800 AD, Marseille,Toulon and Monaco were about the only places on the S. French coast where it was safe to live due to more than a thousand years of Algerian muslim pirate raids.</p>
<p>Even 100 miles inland, areas along the River Rhone were unsafe to live because of the muslim pirates.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really stop until the 1830&rsquo;s, after Algeria became a French colony.</p>

		<p>Remember folks, the midwife&rsquo;s 60 percent taxes support the guy who hit her, the wife, and all the kids they will have.  It says he is French.  He&rsquo;s 24.  Was he born and raised in France?  Obviously he did not learn French ways.</p>
<p>Of course 1,400 years of first cousin marriage and sibling rape<br/>
cause emotional, intellectual and physical damage.  I believe that about 80 percent of all disabled children in England are muslims whose ancestors of course practiced first cousin marriage.</p>

<p>In some countries they import the nurses, midwives and Drs.  In other countries it is done by midwives who learned from other midwives.  In many areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan and both Muslim and Hindu India, babies are delivered by relatives and friends, whatever female is around.</p>
<p>Childbirth mortality of babies and mothers are more prevalent in Muslim countries than in the most primitive areas of Africa, Papau New Guinea and remote Indian areas of Central and S. America.</p>
<p>In the primitive Muslim countries it is the custom for a woman to return to her parent&rsquo;s home to have her first baby.  Reason being that the husband and in laws will not provide even minimal care.  The girl will be left alone to have the baby like an animal in her in laws home (or mud hut).  Her own mother will deliver the baby.</p>
<p>It also avoids being beaten to death if the first baby is a girl.<br/>

<p>How can we stop this insanity?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vote National Front, for starters (or whatever you&rsquo;ve got if you&rsquo;re not French). As for specific political reforms, there are few good candidates:</p>
<p>* Stop further immigration from Third World, especially Islamic countries, excepting maybe some very special circumstances (highly expectional experts, pro-Western political refugees etc). Some very harsh measures must be taken, at least for the first few years - do them regardless.<br/>
* Expel foreigners who&rsquo;ve committed repeated crimes or even a single serious one (armed robbery, rape, murder etc). Increase funding to police and stricten judicial practices to make sure that offenders are usually caught and convicted, and take aggressive action against any no-go zones that have formed.<br/>
* Offer generous repatriation payments for the minorities. Offer their homelands generous payments for granting citizenship to career criminal minorities with only EU nation citizenship, as well as promising to turn blind eye to whatever they wish to do to those &#8216;cultural enrichers&rsquo;. Implement a temporary (10-20 years?) measure to remove citizenships from those serious criminals of alien ethnicities who&rsquo;ve &#8216;qualified&rsquo; to this program, and then expel them.<br/>
* Link child benefits to something. Ethnicity probably won&rsquo;t work, since that could be too blatantly racist, and anyway does nothing to counteract dysgenic pressures of the higher fertility rates of white underclass. Perhaps link it to income, marriage and criminal record - poor families with only one parent, or with father who has fairly new criminal record get subsidies for only one child or something like that. Alternatively, cut most of the benefits for everyone, then use those funds to improve kindergartens etc. and alter legislation in a way to make it less complicated for middle class families to have several children and career women to have any.</p>
<p>That last one is complex issue. For a maximum effect on the ethnic/religious issue, perhaps a cut on benefits would be a good choice anyway. In Finland, of Somali mothers 46% are single mothers (sic), which of course has nothing to with the fact that they pretty much accept polygamy when a man can afford to take care of all his wives. Not a problem with generous welfare available to those women - actually, since the man can take a cut from the welfare and child benefit payments of all his wives, it&rsquo;s a lucrative business for him.</p>
<p>The situation is still well within the range where it can be stabilized with legal and political means. It won&rsquo;t repair the damage caused to Western societies by the mistakes of past decades, but then again, any serious ethnic cleansing (and that&rsquo;s one of those things where little is worse than none) would inflict other kinds of damage, almost certainly even worse.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the solution is home birth and the Muslim husband can assist his wife by himself. Most likely, he will leave her alone to contend with the birth and if there is a complication, he will let her and the baby die and get another wife to whom he will do the same thing. I see a solution here.</p>

<p>And one reason its so expensive is that vast swaths of black and brown folk reside in formerly white working and middle class neighborhoods.  These are of course no-go zones for whites.  It therefore costs an arm and a leg to find a nothing-special apartment or house in a &#8220;hood adjacent&#8221; area.</p>
<p>Used to be white working and middle classes of varying stripes could have their own peaceful neighborhoods at a reasonable price.  They were nothing fancy, but at least they were safe and they had decent public schools.  </p>

		<p> Netzach: Australia had an anti-immigration party, &#8220;One Nation&#8221;. It is now defunct. In 1996, they received 25% of the vote in Queensland. Liberals in Australia were successful in destroying this party. </p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from wikipedia on the demise of &#8220;One Nation&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some Australians reacted angrily to One Nation, as Hanson (the One Nation candidate) was subjected to water balloons filled with urine at public speeches, ridiculed in the media, and received so many death threats she filmed a &#8220;good-bye video&#8221; in the case of her assassination. She was imprisoned by the government on political corruption charges, which were dropped after her imprisonment, despite receiving no compensation.&#8221;</p>
<p> At this time Labour controls the country. Immigration and interracial crime is of course rampant. When the conservatives controlled Australia, nothing was done to stop immigration nor interracial attacks. Conservative Prime Minister, John Howard, actually sided against the White Rebellion in Cronulla.  It seems like the majority of white Australians are similar to Scandinavians. They are hysterically paranoid about perceived white &#8220;racism&#8221;, but they completely ignore the foreign crime explosion. </p>
<p>Your suggestion to vote right wing had good intentions. Unfortunately voting will no longer help our cause. The system is rigged for us to lose. We must simply create a new system to overpower the decaying old system.  This applies not only to Australia, but to all white countries.</p>

		<p>8-Anon: &#8220;Is this same quote true for America, or is America the Christian Republic of America? Or does this only matter if we are speaking of Islam?&#8221;</p>
<p>- Since I am not certain what you are getting at with your questions, I&rsquo;ll make an attempt by responding to what I think you are asking.</p>
<p>1) Is this same quote true for America?: I would say yes, in that when any nation or previously (mostly) homogenous group allows another, different group to enter their area in significant numbers, you will have conflict and a change in the culture and ethno-religious makeup of the area.  Just ask any American Indian about White Immigration into what we now call North America, and see how they feel about it. By the way, how many White Christians were flying jets into skyscrappers back on 9/11? How many Iraqis and Afghans think they are better off after a decade of having Americans with tanks and guns running around all over their countries?  How many Americans think we are better off after spending Trillions of dollars and losing thousands of soldiers? I could care less if some cave dweller half-way around the world hates America.  As long as he stays in his cave, it isn&rsquo;t an issue.</p>
<p>2) or is America the Christian Republic of America? If I were given the choice of living in either a peaceful pagan society or living in a militant Christian society, I would choose peaceful paganism.  Given the choice of mild Christianity or militant Islam, I would choose mild Christianity (I see America as being mostly of this nature, and since this is the environment in which I was raised, I will not change without at least arguing with my politicians or complaining on some racialist website!).  Knowing that no one religion will suit everyone, I would choose to exclude (or outlaw) anyone or any group of White people who professed a militant religion or militant non-religious attitude. That goes for internal militancy against fellow citizens or external militancy against other nations.  I would draw the strongest line on the basis of ethnic/racial separation and go from there.. but this conversation could be very lengthy.</p>
<p>3) Or does this only matter if we are speaking of Islam?  No, not at all.  Islam, or in this case, a Muslim being violent in a predominantly non-Muslim and formerly overwhelmingly Christian nation, was the subject of the report, so my comment was focused on that aspect and the issue it will bring in the future. I would be just as concerned if you had say, militant (insert religious/ethnic group) literally invading another area of the globe.  Having non-militant invasions are equivalent in the displacment which takes place, which in my view, is just another form of violence against a native population. I have said this before: The movement or expansion of peoples from one area of the globe into another has always brought human conflict as a result. In the case of this report, the violence is specific.  In France, we can make a case for violence coming to the Republic as a result of Muslim immigration in general.  And no, I didn&rsquo;t say France, or any other place was crime free before the Muslim invasion, just that the situation is worse now than it was, and that it will get worse than it is now.</p>

<p>You are correct. We are brewing Al-Qaida and there is no other way to put it. It&rsquo;s called &#8220;Forsane Alizza&#8221; (Horsemen of Proudness, http://www.forsane-alizza.com/). They consider that Americans are &#8220;soldiers of the taghut&#8221;(idolatry) led by &#8220;Uncle Ben&#8221; (Obama). They provide videos of their boot camps which are a quite a spectacle that NBC won&rsquo;t show you.</p>

<p>At 1:35, the team of Muslim terrorists pass by a Middle Age caste and the commander says: &#8220;there, you see, is the castle on the Loire, the castle of the disbelievers. Take a look at their flag&#8221;. To those guys, our castles for tourists are fortresses of the Knight Templars in Syria!</p>
<p>At 10:18, they even simulate the capture of an hostage! A wounded hostage! Yet, this is not a terrorist organization to the French government. As for the rest, it&rsquo;s as if Kandahar came to South Bronx. </p>

<p>At this time Labour controls the country. Immigration and interracial crime is of course rampant. When the conservatives controlled Australia, nothing was done to stop immigration nor interracial attacks. Conservative Prime Minister, John Howard, actually sided against the White Rebellion in Cronulla. It seems like the majority of white Australians are similar to Scandinavians. They are hysterically paranoid about perceived white &ldquo;racism&rdquo;, but they completely ignore the foreign crime explosion.</p>
<p>Jack responds:</p>
<p>Your post reflects the very defeatist attitude that all Whites in any position of authority are all traitors, so there is no hope fore anyone and we all might as well give up. @#*$(*@$ this approach.</p>
<p>John Howard was not a traitor on immigration/race relations. He sponsored film presentations of illegal alien boat people from the Middle East being eaten by sharks when they tried to bust in to Australia and he had Australian officials go to Muslim Middle Eastern countries to communicate this fact. Howard was extremely strong on NW immigration and Muslim influence in Australia.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t be so pessimistic and defeatist and give way to conspiracy theories that everyone is against us. So most officials at the top can&rsquo;t be 100% for us and publicly support White race riots against Lebanese like the  Cronulla rebellion.  Stay strong and be positive - politics are coming our way in so many places.</p>

		<p>To Jack in Chicago:</p>
<p>Thanks for the noteworthy information on John Howard. I apologize for not investigating his history more in depth.</p>
<p>For the record, I am not a defeatist. I believe in fighting to the end. Everyday, I try to spread awareness. I also prepare myself physically and mentally for social unrest. </p>
<p>I believe that our western democracies will fail because of multiculturalism, greed and apathy. Whites are doomed in our current political structure simply because of demographics. I believe our only solution is to create our own governments that serve us. Amren and other groups are the seeds of rebellion and justice.  </p>
<p>Whites will not allow themselves to be enslaved by racist, violent third world cultures. I have complete confidence that the good side will triumph, and that we will swat our enemies away like flies.</p>

		<p>#27,</p>
<p>&#8220;Your suggestion to vote right wing had good intentions. Unfortunately voting will no longer help our cause. The system is rigged for us to lose. We must simply create a new system to overpower the decaying old system. This applies not only to Australia, but to all white countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s rigged, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that results are somehow impossible to achieve. To blame all political failures on oppression isn&rsquo;t that much better than explaining all minority failures by racism. It&rsquo;s actively harmful, because when people blame others for their failures, they aren&rsquo;t looking at what they did wrong and how they could do better next time. A lot of the time nationalist parties have failed because of personality conflicts, sheer disorganized unprofessionalism, and having allowed genuine crackpots join and speak for them simply because they&rsquo;re kind of &#8220;non-PC&#8221; or &#8220;patriotic&#8221;. Then, when such parties stumble, of course the establishment kicks it to death when it&rsquo;s down. It&rsquo;s not even much more worse than politics as usual.</p>
<p>Genuine results have been achieved in several European nations, and the crackdown on illegal immigration is doing decently well in some US states. Politics is messy, distasteful and drab at best, and it&rsquo;s extremely hard to achieve decisive results quickly, but right now it&rsquo;s still one of better alternatives (just how much depends of course on the place). At least one can try to buy time and make the homoethnophobes work harder for their newest lunacies.</p>
<p>Downright &#8220;overpowering&#8221; the establishment simply won&rsquo;t work, not now and probably not for a long time. For all its flaws it still possesses considerable strength and a degree of real legitimacy, at least compared to any of its challengers. What can be done, though, is to take a page out of Islamist book and start creating &#8220;parallel societies&#8221;. For example, a cohesive neighbourhood with active charities, some volunteer patrols out at night, and a tradition of solving minor inner conflicts and misdemeanours without calling in police, is already detached partially from the state&rsquo;s grip.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s no sharia for whites making the legal aspect much easier, but overall, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong in taking a good look at how the intruders are trying to carve out their own territory - and then doing the same thing, except better and more constructively.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This may be true for now, but in the not too distant future those religious values will become the laws of the Islamic republic of France. I doubt that even a highly unlikely turn to the far-right would be enough to stem the tide at this point. We have truly gone insane with our policy of allowing the third world into our nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect that the breakup of Yugoslavia was a scale model of some future European wide conflict in the mid 21st century, but when it occurs the US won&rsquo;t even have gas money left to fly jets over Paris in aid of the Sons of Allah. </p>

		<p>33 - Mark J.: &#8220;I suspect that the breakup of Yugoslavia was a scale model of some future European wide conflict in the mid 21st century, but when it occurs the US won&rsquo;t even have gas money left to fly jets over Paris in aid of the Sons of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p>- It will be an interesting conflict to say the least.  My thoughts are that when the fight finally comes to Europe, the ensuing debate in the States upon which side to support will portend the breakup of the Union.  I see it as the next &#8220;World War&#8221;, but my guess is that the Chinese will stay out of it until the sides have exhausted themselves, and then move in, which sounds kind of familiar now that I think of it.</p>
