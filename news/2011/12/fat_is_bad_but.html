<h1><a href="https://www.economist.com/node/21541845">Fat Is Bad but Beautiful</a></h1>
  
<p>The Economist, December 17, 2011</p>

</div> 


<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last month President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s larger-than-life nephew, Khulubuse Zuma, a mining magnate not yet 40, said he could not testify at an insolvency hearing into one of his gold mines because he was too ill with a heart disease owing to his weight and lavish lifestyle.</p>
<p>It is no longer just the inhabitants of the rich world whose waistlines are spreading dangerously. Though 40% of its 50m people live off less than $2 a day, South Africa has become one of the world&rsquo;s fattest countries. Six out of ten South Africans are now clinically overweight or obese, according to a recent survey by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a pharmaceutical company. So, apparently, are a quarter of teenagers and one in six children under nine. Another study, by London&rsquo;s Imperial College, found as many as three-quarters of South African women to be overweight, up from 57% in 1980; it classified 43% as obese, up from 24% in 1980. Men are only a shade trimmer, with 62% reckoned overweight.</p>
<p>As in the richer world, South Africa&rsquo;s accumulating kilos are the result of rapid urbanisation, less physically demanding work, the spread of television, and a shift in diet from home-cooking to processed foods rich in fats and sugar. The country&rsquo;s fast-food industry is booming. But whereas most Westerners seek to be thin, many black Africans still admire bulk in men and big contours in women. President Zuma&rsquo;s four wives are all chubby.</p>
<p>Seven out of ten South Africans in the GSK survey said they had never been on a diet. {snip}</p>
