<h1>Sheriff: Another Woman Stalked</h1>
 

<p>John Monk, The State, December 29, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>The man whom Kershaw and Chesterfield County authorities are charging with murder, kidnapping and rape in the brutal beating death of a 30-year-old woman likely followed another woman earlier that day, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chesterfield County Sheriff Sam Parker confirmed the incident and said his deputies are gathering more information. He said he didn&rsquo;t have enough details yet to elaborate.</p>
<p>Also Wednesday, Kershaw County Sheriff Jim Matthews said he has talked with an assistant prosecutor in the 5th Circuit Solicitor&rsquo;s Office about possibly seeking the death penalty against the 23-year-old suspect, Nickolas Jermaine Miller of Jefferson. {snip}</p>
<p>Miller is charged in Monday&rsquo;s slaying of Beverly Hope Melton of Kershaw. The victim was abducted from her car in broad daylight, sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a baseball bat.</p>
<p>The suspect later confessed after leading authorities to her body later that night in a remote field in Kershaw County, officials said. It appears the two did not know each other.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Around noon, Melton stopped at Jack&rsquo;s convenience store in Jefferson to get gas.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward-an exact time wasn&rsquo;t available-Miller called her grandmother, saying she was being followed by a man in a car and was afraid. The phone conversation ended abruptly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A deputy who went to Jack&rsquo;s and checked surveillance tapes recognized Miller.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not a suspect at that time,&#8221; Parker said. &#8220;We thought he might have some information about Melton.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After 5 p.m.-hours after the victim was abducted-Miller told the sheriff what happened, Parker said. He then led authorities to the body.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The apparent random killing has residents on edge.</p>
<p>Matthews posted on the Kershaw County Sheriff&rsquo;s Facebook page Tuesday-the day the killing was announced-information about a free concealed-weapons permit class to be offered by two detectives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The class filled in about seven minutes,&#8221; Matthews said.</p>
