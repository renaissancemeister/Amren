			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Christie, Associated Press, December 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Homeland Security Department will use 50 immigration agents to screen jail inmates in Arizona&rsquo;s most populous county after it revoked the sheriff&rsquo;s authority to access its systems, the agency said Monday in a letter to U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl.</p>
<p>The letter from Homeland Security assistant secretary Nelson Peacock and obtained by The Associated Press said that the 50 dedicated agents will &#8220;screen, identify, apprehend and remove criminal aliens&#8221; found in Maricopa County jails.</p>
<p>The agents will replace county officers who had special training and the authority to perform the task in Sheriff Joe Arpaio&rsquo;s lockups. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano revoked that authority last week after a Justice Department investigation concluded that Arpaio&rsquo;s office engaged in a pattern and practice of civil rights and constitutional violations and discriminated against Latino inmates in its jails.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio strongly disputed the Justice Department findings and said Monday that the ICE agents won&rsquo;t come close to replacing the 91 officers who had been doing the work. He said agents won&rsquo;t be in the jails and won&rsquo;t deport all illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case, according to an ICE statement sent in response to Arpaio&rsquo;s comment that agents would not actually be in the jails.</p>
<p>&#8220;As was done previously, all individuals booked into the Maricopa County jail will be screened to determine if they are removable from the United States,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;ICE has dedicated over 50 personnel to handle the tasks previously performed by MCSO deputies and ensure that individuals, arrested for criminal offenses and also in the country illegally will be detained and removed from the United States in line with our priorities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Great moments in Anarcho-Tyranny! On the grounds that the sheriff has been attempting to enforce immigration law too vigorously, his ability to enforce immigration law has been rescinded. </p>

		<p>It seems that the DHS, the Justice Department, as well as influential Republican and Democrat politicians, are all engaged in committing the slow murder of the United States.  They either do not enforce the laws we have, or engage in activities that would be considered criminal for the common citizen. In this case, they have so far only restricted the ability of a Sheriff to do his job.  My bet is that this is just a prelude, and there will more than likely be a move to destroy whatever accomplishments Sheriff Arpaio has made in the past. Look for cases to be brought against him and the State of Arizona by &#8220;victims&#8221; of his past enforcement of our immigration laws. If this occurs, we can well imagine having thousands of deported or incarcerated illegals being given U.S. citizenship or at least having those still here being released into the U.S. territory.  They will sue the Sheriff and Arizona for millions of dollars in redress, and will probably even have Eric &#8220;My People&#8221; Holder as their case advisor.  All of course, due to what is now thought of as constitutional violations committed by evil Americans against the illegal Latinos. After that, watch for them to blame Eisenhower for &#8220;Operation Wetback&#8221; and offer citizenship to the million illegals from the 50&rsquo;s, as well as their subsequent 20 million descendants.</p>

		<p>Sounds to me like ICE is taking over so they can turn a blind eye. Arpaio was being &#8220;too efficient&#8221; in his duties. I will bet my left nut that there will be a VERY sharp decline in the amount of detainees that are actually deported. Arpaio should keep careful records of exactly how many of the illegals that ICE &#8220;overlooks&#8221;. <br>
Then he should sue the department.</p>

		<p>We can&rsquo;t ask someone to prove they are a citizen of this country, if they look like they aren&rsquo;t. If they look like they are a citizen, we can ask and demand to see proof that they are. How soon till whites will be shot for trying to escape? They&rsquo;re moving in that direction already. </p>

<p>I would like Napolitano to please explain how Arizona and Sheriff Arpaio are in violation of the Constitution and the founding principles of this republic? How in the world can an alien who entered this country illegally be entitled to the same rights as a US citizen, they are criminals and deserve no special treatment.</p>
<p>When the Federal Government refuses to protect its own people<br>
and aids and abets an invasion by potentially dangerous and hostile foreigners the Government itself is orchestrating a treasonous and tyrannical act against its own people.</p>

		<p>Some of you don&rsquo;t realize this is retaliation for Sheriff Joe investigating the eligibility of Obama- his fake birth certificate, stolen SS#, etc. His report is due in February. Watch for ways of the administration to try and silence and discredit Sheriff Joe even more.</p>

		<p>Funny how NObama wants to give amnesty to all illegals, including at least two of his relatives that are here illegally, one who he has already granted it! He also has an uncle who has assaulted a police officer while on a drunken binge. </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay, just boys being boys; he was just releasing frustration. </p>

		<p>I turned on the TV to check the weather.  CNN has a story about an illegal immigration advocate who has children writing &#8220;what I want for Christmas&#8221; letters to Obama not Santa Claus.</p>
<p>What they want is &#8220;stop deportations, stop sending mommies and daddies of American citizens back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guess the organizer doesn&rsquo;t know the judiciary has ruled the very word Christmas is a violation of the First Amendment.</p>

		<p>How does it possibly amount to &#8220;civil rights and constitutional violations&#8221; by asking someone about their immigration status and running their fingerprints through the appropriate channels to assess immigration status. I suppose we are supposed to ignore the fact that the majority of illegal invaders are from mexico and thus hispanic and any effort to enforce the law amounts to &ldquo;racism&rdquo; by subjecting them to such questioning. </p>
<p>Therefore, the hispanic &ldquo;advocacy groups&rdquo; start complaining to a government that has a soft spot for these criminals and has a penchant for finding &ldquo;civil rights violations&rdquo; when it comes to those trying to combat this  invasion we are being subjected to. </p>
<p>What Napolitano really means is that Sheriff Joe was excellent at tuning over illegal invaders to the feds for deportation. We know how adverse this government is to that! We also know how sensitive and easily offended hispanics can be, especially those here illegally.</p>
<p>So what are the 50 ICE officers replacing Sheriff Joe and his deputies going to do differently to indentify illegal invaders in custody? My guess is they will not be doing much immigration enforcment, but rather act as window dressing.<br>

		<p>#14 AM- Good point- this reeks of a sandbagging against Sheriff Joe. If they can demonise him effectively with this &#8220;finding&#8221; that he&rsquo;s racist, and then de-legitimise him the report due in Feb will be written off as the ramblings of a madman.</p>

		<p>I, too, believe this is only a prelude to more intrusive action by the DHS possibly culminating in the arrest of Arpaio for alleged &#8220;civil rights&#8221; violation.  I still don&rsquo;t understand how illegal aliens can be accorded constitutional protections.  </p>
<p>I guarantee DHS won&rsquo;t deport anyone and illegals will play a pivotal role in Obama&rsquo;s plans to steal the 2012 election by any means necessary.</p>
