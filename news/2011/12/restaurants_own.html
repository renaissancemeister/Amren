			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Perry, Los Angeles Times, December 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The owner and the manager of a French restaurant in San Diego were sentenced in federal court Thursday to serve probation and pay fines after pleading guilty to knowingly hiring undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Michel Malecot, 59, the owner of French Gourmet, was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to pay $396,575 in fines, authorities said. Richard Kauffmann, 59, the manager, was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $2,500 for his role in hiring the undocumented immigrants to work in the restaurant&rsquo;s bakery and catering businesses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When employers do not comply, we will take vigorous enforcement action to ensure they do not profit from this illegal tactic,&#8221; [U.S. Atty. Laura] Duffy said.</p>
<p>Malecot&rsquo;s case reflects a new approach by federal authorities as they crack down on the hiring of illegal immigrants. After years of conducting sweeps of undocumented laborers, the federal government is now focusing more on the employers who knowingly hire them.</p>

		<p>I thought that laws could not be enforced capriciously or arbitrarily.  In fact I believe it is a fundamental part of the  validity of the justice system.</p>

		<p>So a German or French or Italian restuarant is &#8216;racist&rsquo; if they only staff whites, yet mexican or chinese or ethiopian can staff people of that ethnicity and it&rsquo;s ok.  Gee, no double standard there!  Sorry, but I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very pleasing to go to a German restuarnt having Javier is making my schnitzel or going to a French restuarant and being served by DeShawntae.  </p>

<p>Illegals aren&rsquo;t necessarily Mexican remember. </p>
<p>But yeah, now this just needs to be done a few hundred thousand more times! And the money should go into the unemployment funds. </p>

		<p>Just a few stings like this per week around the country would cause them all to self-deport.</p>
<p>We should also charge the country of origin be it Germany or Mexico for any emergency medical care an Illegal receives.</p>
<p>If you are here illegally and caught you should have to serve a 1 year sentence in a Joe Arpaio style prison camp and then deported.</p>

		<p>This is a joke.  The government knows full well that there are hundreds of thousands of small grocery stores, construction companies, and other businesses who hire undocumented &#8220;immigrants&#8221; (better called illegal aliens).  No one does a damn thing about it.  And the guy that owns this restaurant suffers the consequences.  The government enforces the law only occasionally, I believe, to &#8220;pacify&#8221; us, make us think that they&rsquo;re &#8220;doing something&#8221;, when they really aren&rsquo;t.  This is to keep us &#8220;at bay&#8221;, while 99.9% of the rest of the businesses and companies get away Scot free with hiring illegals.</p>

		<p>If this were consistent it would make sense otherwise it is just grandstanding. Almost half of a billion dollars worth of fruit and vegs went to waste because our Americans wouldn&rsquo;t take the jobs?</p>

		<p>A $400,000 disincentive to hire illegals is progress at least!  Since the motivation for greedy corporate pigs to hire illegal aliens in the first place is profit, hefty fines are an excellent way to address the problem.  A half-million-dollar fine is benefits the government, is a heavy blow to a small business, and heaps cheaper than locking up Juan the cook or Mustafa the busboy.</p>
<p>If a problem as big as illegal immigration is going to be effectively solved, the solution will have to be inexpensive and efficient; huge fines for the businesses involved fit both criteria.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want &ldquo;Juan&rdquo; the cook &#8220;locked up,&#8221; I want him deported and soon after he&rsquo;s identified as an illegal invader. If he ever returns, he should be prosecuted for felony re-entry after a formal order of deportation was executed against him. That is the law, but rarely is it enforced against the Juans actively invading our country, laws be damned! </p>
<p>  As far as the fine goes, I suppose it will hurt well enough. Although, I would prefer a much more painful message be sent to those who commit treason against America by hiring illegal invader labor; to the detriment of our citizens and country. <br>
