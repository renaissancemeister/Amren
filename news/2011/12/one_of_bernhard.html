<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Exactly 27 years to the day after Bernhard Goetz  &mdash;  famous in New York lore as the &#8220;Subway Vigilante&#8221;  &mdash;  shot four young men he thought were threatening him on a train, one of them killed himself by swallowing prescription pills in a low-rent Bronx motel, authorities said.</p>
<p>James Ramseur, 45, was found dead of an apparent overdose at 11:30 a.m. yesterday at the Paradise Hotel at 2990 Boston Road, law-enforcement sources said last night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No suicide note was found and there were no wounds on the body.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ramseur had gotten out of prison only 17 months ago, after serving 25 years upstate for raping a young woman on a Bronx rooftop.</p>
<p>The shooting took place on Dec. 22, 1984, when Ramseur, 18, and neighborhood pals Darrell Cabey, Barry Allen and Troy Canty, all 19, were riding a downtown No. 2 train.</p>
<p>As it approached Chambers Street, they encountered Goetz, an electronics specialist. What ensued is in dispute.</p>
<p>Goetz told authorities the intimidating youths demanded $5 from him. The teens insisted they were only panhandling.</p>
<p>Goetz fired five shots from his Smith &amp; Wesson, hitting all of them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many residents of the city, which was then undergoing an unprecedented era of street crime, hailed him as a hero.</p>
<p>But since the four youths were black, others called him a racist.</p>
<p>He was convicted of illegally possessing a loaded firearm, but cleared of the more serious charges  &mdash;  four counts of attempted murder.</p>

		<p>Months before Goetz lawfully used reasonable force to defend himself, there were multiple reports in media of maiming in the NY subway. The jury must have known &#8220;panhandling&#8221; through mob intimidation was highly unlikely.</p>

		<p>Well considering that one of the black youths later spent 25 years in prison for rape, and Goetz was acquited of attempted murder, I would say that what happened before the shooting is not &#8220;in dispute&#8221;. Sure they were panhandling, but doing so aggressively.</p>
<p>Even 28 years later, liberals still refuse to admit black criminal behavior.</p>

		<p>Of the 4 people Goetz shot that day, 3 almost immediately went on to commit other violent crimes and spend time in prison, the 4th ended up a paraplegic and was not able to do any further damage to society, courtesy of Mr. Goetz&rsquo;s marksmanship.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Many residents&hellip;hailed him as a hero. But since the four youths were black, others called him a racist.&#8221;  Perhaps the greatest Orwellian trick of all time was turning everything that common sense dictated was heroic and just and making it &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Doubly astounding when you consider it is virtually always the non-whites who are truly racist in any substantial way.  A meaningless and idiotic word has been turned into a nebulous bludgeon that has utterly cowed the white majority.  The charge is so damning and terrifying directly in proportion to the enormity and obviousness of the truth it covers up.<br>
-I hear Dartavious mugged old lady Thompson, raped her, doused her in gasoline, and set her ablaze.<br>
-Well, at least he wasn&rsquo;t a racist cracker like that old crone. </p>

		<p>I highly doubt Ramseur is a suicide. Blacks rarely commit suicide since their unjustifiably high levels of self-esteem mitigate against offing oneself. My theory is that he overdosed by accident since he is likely unable to follow simple directions on his meds. The date of his death is a mere coincidence. Surely he would not have felt remorse over his life of crime. </p>

		<p>The linkage to Goetz is lame.  James Ramseur was a loser and a criminal.  He peaked when he was shoot by Goetz.  It is the only reason the New York Post wrote about his death, otherwise his suicide would have gone unnoticed.<br>
Make no mistake, vigilantism is seldom tolerated.  But these guys were not model citizens.  </p>

		<p>Bernhard Goetz, will always be viewed as a hero in my book. He was the epitome of a mild mannered citizen, who under normal circumstances, would never dream of harming anyone. But the day came when he finally had endured enough. The fact that one of his feral attackers died of an overdose, means the community has one less predator to worry about. At last count there are now 39 states that offer some form of a legal permit to carry a concealed handgun. I suspect that what happened to Bernhad Goetz after the shooting (his incarceration and media demonization) was the beginning of a dramatic change in how reasonable people view self-defense. I live in a state where citizens are now allowed to defend themselves when attacked and I thank Bernhard Goetz for his sacrifices and for his contribution to freedom. </p>

		<p>Goetz packed a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 revolver. I also own one as it is quite concealable and easy to use, so I am familiar with this weapon. It holds five rounds.  If he had carried a semi-auto with 11 rounds (ten-round mag plus one in the chamber), he could have plugged nearly each &#8220;urban youth&#8221; with three rounds a piece, thus increasing the chance of taking down Ramseur for good, and thereby saving Ramseur&rsquo;s future victim from rape. </p>

		<p>Democrat Mayor Koch denounced the &#8220;vigilante.&#8221;  All efforts were made to smear Goetz.  Meanwhile, for the first quarter following the shooting of the muggers, crime in the subway decreased - I think by about 75%, but my memory may not recall the exact amount.  For about 3 months, muggers were probably afraid they might pick the wrong person.<br>
Goetz was a hero.  His action saved many others from being mugged.  He save whites by shooting Black racist thieves.<br>
Therefore, the Democrats and the liberals hated him and forced him into jail.  The Democrats hate those who defend themselves, and swoon over the minorities who demand their &#8220;fair share&#8221; by stealing, punching, and killing those who work.  </p>

		<p>Why is the dead thug referred to as a &#8220;victim&#8221;? The fact that he carried on with his criminal career till caught and convicted of rape proves that he was guilty of exactly what Mr. Goetz said he was, and that even after being shot for his crime, he was too dumb to learn to mend his ways. <br>
I always did think Bernie Goetz was a stand up guy who finally did what a lot of folks just don&rsquo;t have the balls to put into action. Kudos to him, then and now. Hope he is having a nice, quiet, happy life.</p>

		<p>For those too young to remember, NYPD launched a massive effort into tracking down Bernard Goetz for his &#8220;crimes.&#8221;  Meanwhile, they just couldn&rsquo;t do enough for his &#8220;victims,&#8221; all of whom had length felony criminal records at age 18 or 19.  And the liberal press always likes to forget they they were threatening Goetz with sharpened screwdrivers as part of their &#8220;pahandling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks like he did succeed in rehabilitating one of them, as only the 3 that could still walk went about their normal criminal careers afterwards:</p>
<p>(from Wikipedia)<br>
In March 1985, soon after being released from the hospital for the treatment of his gunshot wound, James Ramseur falsely reported to police that two men hired by Goetz had kidnapped and attempted to kill him,[63] but was not charged in this hoax. In May 1985, Ramseur held the gun while an associate raped, sodomized and robbed a pregnant eighteen-year-old woman on the rooftop of the Bronx building where he lived, and in 1986 was sentenced to 8⅓ to 25 years in prison. According to the New York State Department of Corrections[64] inmate search site, Ramseur served his sentence and was released in July, 2010. Ramseur was found dead of a drug overdose, in an apparent suicide, in a Bronx, New York motel room on 22 December 2011, the 27th anniversary of the incident on the number 2 train.[65][66]</p>
<p>Barry Allen committed two robberies after the shooting, one of them a 1986 chain snatching in the elevator of the building where he lived.[52] The second arrest in May, 1991 brought him a sentence of three and a half to seven years for probation violation and third degree robbery. He was released on parole in December, 1995.[67][64][68]</p>
<p>After a number of minor arrests for petty offenses, Canty was ordered to undergo an 18-month drug treatment program at a rehabilitation center, which he completed in 1989.[69][68] He was later charged with assault, robbery, and resisting arrest in an altercation with his common-law wife in August, 1996, but was not convicted and did not serve time.[7</p>

		<p>So many thoughts&hellip;.</p>
<p>Goetz was brutally beaten by three muggers not long before this. He suffered permanent injuries. He was also undoubtedly traumatized by this experience. No mention of this in the article.</p>
<p>They were carrying sharpened 13&#8221; long screwdrivers. No mention of this in the article.</p>
<p>One of the black &#8220;victims&#8221; took the fifth. If innocent, why?</p>
<p>I doubt he committed suicide. It just isn&rsquo;t like blacks to do that. Suicide is an act of despair, usually caused by, or attributed with, low self-esteem. Blacks, albiet usually without justification, have high self-esteem. Plus there was no note. It was probably unintentional.</p>
<p>Note how all the black &#8220;victims&#8221;, but one, who was incapacitated, went on to commit numerous crimes. Goetz never did. Had they just left him alone, he probably never would have had any trouble with the law in his life.</p>
<p>Who knows how many people were saved from being mugged because of him? Probably a lot. First he took out four muggers and scared a lot more.</p>
<p>Finally I would ask many people to remember that Goetz&rsquo;s actions helped a lot to make gun-carry laws possible. He paid a huge price personally for others to have this right.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s odd that they used  the term &#8220;victim&#8221; in that headline. The only victim was Goetz, and he did not kill himself. Perhaps they meant one of the perpetrators killed himself. Must be a typo.  I say good, he was 27 years too late. </p>
<p>I also think that Goetz should have gotten a medal. My only complaint with Goetz is that he didn&rsquo;t take them all out. He would have prevented future crimes if he did.</p>

		<p>I guess Ramseur never collected a dime from that judgement an majority black Bronx jury gave him. Also his rape charge was a bit understated. He  sodomized the poor  women who was 7 months pregnant as if she was a gay man at Rikers. I wish Goetz had hired me. We would still be fighting extradition from Florida to New York. He was convicted of possessing a hand gun by the same jury who also ruled that if he hadn`t had it he would have been killed or suffered grave bodily harm. I never heard if that woman lost her baby. If not, the person would be 27 years old today. I wonder if that person if still alive has any remorse for Ramseur`s passing?<br>

&#8220;Who knows whether this guy was trying to kill himself or whether he was just trying to get high or numb his brain? Blacks don&rsquo;t commonly commit suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>You make a good point, as usual. I always enjoy your posts. I think that their intolerable narcissism is what keeps them from committing suicide or maybe it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re cowardly. It takes lots of guts to commit suicide. They&rsquo;re only &#8220;brave&#8221; when raping a terrified woman or assaulting the elderly or the young if the odds are ten to one in their favor. <br>
Let&rsquo;s just hope that Ramseur did commit suicide and that maybe a lot of other Mau Mau will follow his lead. </p>

		<p>I would like to point out that Mr. Goetz&rsquo;s future criminal record after this &#8220;incident&#8221; are not mentioned in this article. I wonder why that is??? That&rsquo;s because there isn&rsquo;t any! An upstanding American defended himself with justifiable deadly force. We need more Americans like Mr. Goetz. If I ever got the chance to meet him I would buy him dinner and treat him like a hero.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I guess Ramseur never collected a dime from that judgement an majority black Bronx jury gave him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t Ramseur. The guy who he put in a wheelchair won that judgement because of Goetz shooting him twice or something.</p>

		<p>Interest tidbit about the actual trial. When Goetz testified that these &#8220;victims&#8221; said &#8220;give me five dollars,&#8221; one of the lawyers asked him &#8220;is it possible they said &#8216;may I have five dollars?&#8221; I am sure they didn&rsquo;t. But let&rsquo;s entertain for fun&rsquo;s sake that this is the way it was asked. Any intelligent guesses to what would have happned if Goetz responded &#8220;no, you may not&#8221;? Funnier still is that the &#8220;victims&#8221; defense was that they were only panhandling. I guess since panhandling is such a risky activity, you want to make sure you did it with a gang, sorry I meant to type &#8220;group.&#8221; No word yet if this &#8220;group&#8221; had a history of singing Christmas carols door-to-door to earn a few extra $&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>God Bless Bernhard Goetz.  I am sorry to say that he died several years ago. </p>
<p>I rode the New York subway occasionally at that time and there was a feeling of security after that incident.  The MTA Transit Police Force had never accomplished that.  (This was before Mayor Guiliani brought the Transit Police under the NYPD and made the subways reasonably safe to ride.)</p>
<p>Former PA Senator Arlen Specter pressured the New York pols Mayor Koch and Governor Cuomo to throw the book at Mr. Goetz.  Shortly after I saw Senator Specter riding on Market Street in Philadelphia in the back seat of a limousine.  I am sure that the driver was his bodyguard.  It is interesting that his travel was over the route of the Philadelphia&rsquo;s Market Street subway.  Dangerous travel on the subway was only for the common people not for well to do liberals.</p>
<p>Poor Mr Goetz served the full 13 months of his sentence at Rikers Island Prison although it was common at that for convicts to be released early for good behavior and because of overcrowding.</p>

		<p>He went to jail for rape. But who knows how many times he committed rape in prison? And who knows how many crimes he and the other two committed for which they were not caught? In any case one thing can not be seriously denied. Had they got on the subway train and just left Goetz alone nothing would have happened. They initiated the confrontation.</p>

		<p>Dutchman, you make some good points on black self-esteem.  But if the drugs involved had no recreational use, that may have contributed to the certainty in the verdict that it was a suicide.  Also, for the overdose to happen on the anniversary of the shooting on balance suggests that it may have been a deliberate act of self-harm.</p>

<p>How about a Bernie Goetz comic book? Just one issue; or perhaps several if you document the crimes of his tormentors.</p>
<p>Or a Bernie Goetz/Epic Beard Man double feature?</p>
<p>They could appear in the latest issue of &#8220;Thor.&#8221; They could meet  Thor and be assured by him of entrance into Valhalla, because of their valorous deeds.</p>

		<p>Goetz was a hero, like Paul Kersey or Michael Douglas in &#8220;Falling Down,&#8221; average White guys pushed over the edge by black thugs. His big mistake was turning himself in and thinking the system would give him fair treatment. If I ever found myself in that situation, you can bet I would never trust the law and political correctness to look after my best interests as a white Man. </p>

<p>Thank you for that link. It was a most biased and poorly written article. A lawyer for Ramseur calls Goetz a &#8220;racist madman&#8221; and claims his client&rsquo;s soul &#8220;was destroyed&#8221; by Goetz. The writer even calls Goetz a &#8220;nerd&#8221;. Such an awful article. Bernhard Goetz had one atypical day in his life where he was forced into violence. Other then that he has lived a peaceful life. His &#8220;victims&#8221; continued thier life of crime because that is just what they were all along, criminals.</p>

A street thug will swallow a bunch of prescription pills on the hope it will get him high.  </p>
<p>And then you said &#8220;Also, for the overdose to happen on the anniversary of the shooting on balance suggests that it may have been a deliberate act of self-harm.&#8221; It also could suggest that Ramseur was planning on celebrating the anniversary of his becoming a ghetto celebrity/civil rights hero. I&rsquo;m not trying to pick an argument; I just think you&rsquo;re being to way too charitable towards this low life ghetto creep. </p>

		<p>It was a most biased and poorly written article. A lawyer for Ramseur calls Goetz a &ldquo;racist madman&rdquo; and claims his client&rsquo;s soul &ldquo;was destroyed&rdquo; by Goetz. The writer even calls Goetz a &ldquo;nerd&rdquo;. Such an awful article.</p>
<p>______________</p>
<p>Yes, the pro-criminal bias was truly disgusting, but you must remember that this article appeared the NY Daily Snooze, a now-leftist rag that&rsquo;s not fit to line the bottom of a birdcage with.</p>
<p>The lawyer in question is Ron Kuby, an apologist for minority crime and a protege of William Kunstler.</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/etCjj" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/etCjj</a></p>
<p>Kunstler&rsquo;s defense of the &#8220;Chicago Seven&#8221; from 1969-1970 led The New York Times to label him &#8220;the country&rsquo;s most controversial and, perhaps, its best-known lawyer &hellip;&#8221;[1] Kunstler is also well known for defending members of the Catonsville Nine, Black Panther Party, Weather Underground Organization, the Attica Prison rioters, and the American Indian Movement.[1] He also won a de facto segregation case regarding the District of Columbia&rsquo;s public schools and &#8220;disinterred, singlehandedly&#8221; the concept of federal removal jurisdiction in the 1960s.[1] Kunstler refused to defend right-wing groups such as the Minutemen, on the grounds that: &#8220;I only defend those whose goals I share. I&rsquo;m not a lawyer for hire. I only defend those I love.&#8221;[1] </p>
