			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Boyle, The Daily Caller, December 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric Holder accused his growing chorus of critics of racist motivations in a Sunday interview published in the New York Times. When reached by The Daily Caller Monday this morning, the Department of Justice provided no evidence to support the attorney general&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>Holder said some unspecified faction  &mdash;  what he refers to as the &#8220;more extreme segment&#8221;  &mdash;  is driven to criticize both him and President Barack Obama due to the color of their skin. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a way to get at the president because of the way I can be identified with him,&#8221; Holder said, according to the Times. &#8220;Both due to the nature of our relationship and, you know, the fact that we&rsquo;re both African-American.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holder&rsquo;s accusations come as resignation calls mount from a growing list of 60 congressmen, two senators, every major Republican presidential candidate and two sitting governors, spurred on by the congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious.</p>
<p>Additionally, seventy-five congressmen have signed onto a House resolution for a vote of &#8220;no confidence&#8221; in Holder as attorney general. Between the two lists, there are 86 total in the House who no longer trust Holder to head the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fast and Furious was a program of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, overseen by Holder&rsquo;s DOJ. It sent thousands of weapons to Mexican drug cartels via straw purchasers  &mdash;  people who legally purchased guns in the United States with the known intention of illegally trafficking them somewhere else.</p>
<p>At least 300 people in Mexico were killed with Fast and Furious weapons, as was Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. {snip}</p>
<p>Holder has said he was unaware of the operation, despite having been sent several personal memos from his top deputies and assistants. The memos contained intimate details of how Operation Fast and Furious worked. {snip}</p>

		<p>That is really the pot calling the kettle black! Holder is an extreme racist! </p>
<p>Holder testified to congress that the hate law was to protect everybody but whites. </p>
<p>Holder&rsquo;s Justice Department (so misnamed under him that it is a laughing stock) stopped legal action taken against the New Black Panther Party polling place thugs who were threatening and intimidating white voters at the voting place with clubs! </p>
<p>Holder is declaring war on American whites!</p>

		<p>This is fantastic news! This practice of howling &#8220;racism&#8221; at every, and I mean EVERY criticism, often when race clearly has nothing to do with it one way or the other, has caused many, many Whites to basically roll their eyes and shrug off all these hysterical claims - even when race DOES factor in. People are, in a few words, sick to death of this baseless nonsense about &#8220;racism,&#8221; which is invoked every time some non-White liberal/leftist gets accused of some criminality of another.</p>
<p>The more often they do this, the better is really is for us. </p>

		<p>Besides having Congressional hearings on the Fast and Furious debacle, I&rsquo;m wondering why hearings aren&rsquo;t conducted on Holder&rsquo;s refusal to protect white citizens at the polling place from attacks and intimidation by the anti-white racist Black Panthers.</p>
<p>Holder himself added even more outrage to the incident by claiming the incident was a payback of sorts for all the alleged harassment of blacks about 60 years ago and before, and referred to the culprits as &#8220;my people.&#8221;</p>
<p>That the United States Justice Department refuses to protect citizens on the basis of color is a far greater scandal than selling guns to the drug cartels, yet the issue seems to have died on the vine, in spite of the fact a white whistle blower verified there was an appalling anti-white attitude within the department.</p>
<p>Where are the Congessional hearings on this incident?  Why has it been swept under the rug?</p>
<p>In addition to that, Mark Lloyd, Obama&rsquo;s FCC man declared that, &#8221; &#8216;White People&rsquo; Need to be Forced to &#8216;Step Down&rsquo; &#8216;So Someone Else Can Have Power&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pursuing that agenda the FCC has initiated a program of intimidation and harassment to various T.V. stations in an attempt to force them to hire unqualified blacks, so there will be more black faces on the news.  Notice an influx of blacks on the news nowadays?</p>
<p>The bottom line is this:  It is typical of blacks like Holder to scream white racism where none exists and blatantly ignore the abysmal racism that is rampant throughout his department and the OBama administration in general.</p>
<p>Where are the Congresional hearings for these outrages?</p>

		<p>This is one of the most compelling stories as to why those who are in power can play by different rules than the rest of us. First of all, Holder looks more East Indian than black, so if the average American saw him on the street and didn&rsquo;t know what this clown looks like, they would probably not think he was black. You see, if it meant getting into some secret club where White elites might be the majority, this guy would probably spin himself into the ground telling the head of this group that he wasn&rsquo;t black. He is a minority of convenience, and this country is full of these parasitic types. Psychopaths are all mingled in to our societies. They make up 4% of the population, but are most likely over-represented among the black population. The more accurate term may be sociopath. Always be aware of your surroundings. </p>

<p>In terms of lighter blacks who constantly rail about their Afrocentric roots, we must remember the words of the bard: &#8220;Me thinks the lady doth protest too much&#8221; or something to that effect. Strange that Holder and Obama are using their personal insecurities to make everyone else miserable.</p>

		<p>I had given the President the benefit of the doubt in the beginning of his term (even if I didn&rsquo;t vote for him), actually having some hope that things might change for the better.  It has long been obvious that he and many of his appointees, Holder in particular, carry within them a racial hatred of Whites that is extremely deep. It seems to me that they are willing to take whatever action they can to bring harm to the White world no matter what the cost to the Nation.  Actually, it seems the nation is irrelevant to them, in that as long as the White world is harmed, nothing else really matters at all.  For the record, neither am I a supported of Bush and/or most of his policies as President.  What was it that Wallace said&hellip; segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever, or something to that effect..?  I have become a believer.</p>

	Give Chuck Grassley a call; tell Chuck his doing a good job holding Holders feet to the fire on the Fast &amp; Furious gun running scandal, and remind the Senator, that Eric Holder can&rsquo;t be trusted in such an important position.   <br>
	<br>
	Chuck Grassley is being harassed and investigated by the Justice Department because of the indictment against Holder. So this is our chance call Senator Chuck Grassley, leave a message, tell him we support for his efforts. <br>

		<p>Ah, the &#8220;race card&#8221;, the last refuge of the rogue, but what&rsquo;s particularly galling about Holder playing it is that he let black panther vote intimidators off the hook simply because they were black intimidators instead of white intimidators. This guy is most assuredly racist, but no doubt believes blacks can&rsquo;t be racist because they lack the &#8220;power&#8221; to be so even though he wields considerable power.</p>

		<p>* - the Department of Justice provided no evidence to support the attorney general&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>Of course they didn&rsquo;t, and they know they don&rsquo;t need to either! Just saying so is enough &#8220;evidence&#8221; they feel they need and anybody that questions it will also be labeled a &#8220;racisss&#8221;. By throwing out the race card, the investigation must be getting close to implicating Mr. &#8220;my people&#8221;. Look for the word &#8220;lynching&#8221; to start popping up also.<br>
 God it&rsquo;s good to be a race realist - they&rsquo;re so predictable to me now! I wish more Whites could experience the relief you feel once you&rsquo;ve broken the shackles of P.C. and White-guilt and go through life with your eyes wide open. Being &#8220;born again&#8221; comes to mind.  <br>

<p>You&rsquo;re damn right he is! When he ignored the &#8220;Panther&#8221; ( one of the two who were intimidating the voters) who on  a busy Philadelphia street, called for the killing of  &#8221; crackers and their little babies&#8221;, that&rsquo;s clearly a declaration of war.<br>
Twenty years ago Bob Grant 77 WABC NYC used to say, &#8220;war has been declared on us but we just haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet.</p>

		<p>The problem is that he is wrong.  The problem is that Obama-Holder critics <i>aren&rsquo;t</i> motivated by &#8220;racism.&#8221;  If they were, then they would still be investigating this Operation Gun Runner, but it would be secondary to their investigating Holder&rsquo;s pro-black and anti-white statements and activities.  That&rsquo;s the bigger and more crucial scandal.</p>

		<p>We should consider this good news. &#8220;Racist&#8221; is now tossed around by minorities as a common curse word and more and more white people are getting fed up with it. They are beginning to see it for what it really is, namely an empty and baseless slander, used by minorities for empowerment and economic benefits by appealing to white guilt. Many white liberals will join their ranks and sing soprano in the whiny-choirs, but their numbers are diminishing and the large white middle class cannot be fooled forever.  </p>
<p>If anyone is a racist, it&rsquo;s Eric Holder himself. His justice department dropped the Black Panthers voting intimidation case from the 2008 election, and he has openly stated on camera, that he identifies with his fellow blacks as &ldquo;my people&rdquo;. If any white attorney general had done such things, he would&rsquo;ve been sacked on the spot on charges of racism and hatred.</p>
<p>I hope that Mr. Holder continues with his racism accusations, now that his involvement in Operation Fast and Furious is becoming more and more obvious. It will only bring more people to our side. </p>

		<p>OK, OK, OK, The people who don&rsquo;t like Holder are racist blah,blah,blah. Now, can we get to the facts of this case? So I guess if an Italian Mafia boss got locked up on murder, extortion and racketeering charges all he would have to say is, a &ldquo;more extreme segment&rdquo; &mdash; is driven to criticize both him and the Italian community. After he said that the charges no matter if they were true or not would magically disappear and everybody would live happy forever after.Sorry, Holder but the Attorney General who cried racism is not going to be any more effective than the boy who cried wolf. I guess because I used the word boy in the example used just proves I&rsquo;m one of those racist Holder is moaning about. Take your eyes of the criminal charges and watch the racist. </p>

		<p>Many of his detractors do have racist motivations. They&rsquo;re concerned with members of the white race. That&rsquo;s the definition of racism. Whites are the only group no one seems to care about or have anyone out side the K who looks after their interests. It&rsquo;s about time whites start becoming racists too. It is the only way for their to be equality.</p>

		<p>Reply to both #3 and #4.</p>
<p>Good point, there should be hearings about Holder protecting the Philladelphia New Black Panther Party racist, terrorist, criminals. It is as important as the &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221; crimes. But it is not more important. Fast and Furious was an attempt to deny 2nd ammendment rights to Americans, was criminal, and caused the murder of some honest American officials who were trying to protect our borders. It is extremely serious.</p>
<p>I am absolutely convinced that someday there will be a hearing. There will be a series of trials like the Nuremberg War Crimes trials, I believe. Holder&rsquo;s will be among them. There will be a few thousand of those trials, perhaps more.</p>
<p>Reply to #4. Holder is obviously partly white. He is like the Comanche chief Quanah Parker (except that he is not half the man that Quanah Parker was). Parker was half white, half comanche. He had pale blue eyes and jet black hair. He chose sides. He chose to be a comanche and he was a tireless raider attacking whites. Holder is similar. He hates whites and wishes to harm them as much as possible. He has made his choice. He IS black in my book! He has chosen to harm us. He must be held accountable.</p>

<p>Many of the people who voted for Obama really believe that the problems that we have are all caused by old white men (who are inherently evil in the phantasy world that they create) and blacks are cool, wise, morally correct and always come to the rescue in the nick of time. After all, that is what happens in all of the movies. That is what their communist religion teaches them.</p>
<p>The typical white who voted for Obama was a 40, 50,or 60 something Birkenstock-wearing, haagen daas eating pampered self-congratulating shallow limosine or volvo liberal women with hidden hopes of bedding Obama. Probably almost of of the whites under 30, too. I met a couple of these middle aged groupies at a health food store once during Obama&rsquo;s campaign (not just idiotic race liberals need to eat healthy!). They were loudly singing the praises of the wise and magnificent Obama at the checkout stand. </p>
<p>I pointed out to them that he had said that he would vote to repeal the Patriot Act in congress and then had turned around and voted for it. I added that he is a protégé of Brzesinski of Grand Chessboard (Project For a New American Century WWIII strategy) and Technotronic era fame and of George Soros,but they didn&rsquo;t care. They were in a sort of euphoria that was akin to a member of a cult and did not even consider what I said. It reminded me even more of the idiotic teenie chicks who used to throw their panties up onto the stage at rock concerts. Groupies!</p>
<p> They just continued eurphorically chattering and giggling about how great Obama was. I would be very surprised if they didn&rsquo;t go back to their cars and accuse me of racism where I couldn&rsquo;t hear them. You couldn&rsquo;t oppose him because of his communist politics, his lies and false promises, and his totalitarian anti-constitutionalist bent, and the fact that he is a Brzezinski and Soros marionnette, it has to be racism.<br>

<p>Obama and Holder being racist is not a problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that most whites aren&rsquo;t racist.</p>

<p>Voting against Obama because of Holder   &mdash;   or the Supreme Court for that matter   &mdash;   is at bottom laziness, the dodging of duty, the hope that some distant magic man or nine guys in drag will spare us the duty and work of being real men in our neighborhoods, towns, and places of work.</p>

		<p>Only knee-jerk, fuzzy-headed white liberals or low-IQ blacks still give heed to accusations of racism.  The term has become a joke and definitely the last refuge of a fool.  <br>
The Republicans can make hay with this issue whether Holder stays or goes.  If he&rsquo;s still around during the campaign, the GOP candidate can constantly mention the fact; if Obama has fired him, it can be mentioned that the Prez showed awful judgment in choosing him and was slow in correcting a mistake.  Obama should have gotten rid of him as soon as his overt racial bigotry became apparent.  Now, it simply looks like the Prez agrees with him or is too loathe to sack a brother.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m halfway through J. Christian Adams book &#8216;Injustice. Everyone interested in the Holder DOJ should go out and buy this book today! Surprisingly, I found it in stock at Barnes and Nobles. Warning: take your blood pressure medicine before reading it. Everything you need to know about voter fraud and government collusion is contained therein. </p>

		<p>Are most blacks this stupid?  Really, I try to have faith in blacks and see that there are a majority that really don&rsquo;t hate whites, that really don&rsquo;t want us all dead, that see it&rsquo;s contradictory to want preferences for blacks only while whining about (supposed) preferences that whites benefity from, etc.  It&rsquo;s hard when I see so-called black conservatives that cowardly whites relied on to say and do things they were afraid to say and do turn against them and vote for black interests.  I&rsquo;ve noticed many black actors who I thought were of good character and had common sense (like Morgan Freeman and Orlando Jones) pull the race card or wish death upon white conservatives.  </p>

		<p>Our adversaries hurl accusations of racism at us, but what they don&rsquo;t understand is that 3,000 years of history in Europe, Southwest Asia, and North Africa taught us survival by embracing a particular and noble system of classism.  When people like Holder run into our class system, they discover that they operate at the lower levels of our system&hellip;and it feels to them like racism.  </p>
<p>Brag about our willingness to elevate the highest class of conduct, and tell the Holders that they fit in at only the lowest level of our system.  It&rsquo;s just too bad for them.</p>
<p>Somehow we have been brainwashed into rising up when we hear &#8220;racist&#8221; but we really shouldn&rsquo;t make that term our centerpiece of argument, it&rsquo;s our entirely commendable classism that puts the Holders down.</p>

		<p>Holder is a very light skinned, mixed race man who&rsquo;s family is from Barbados - hardly one to claim great oppression as a poor Black sharecropper from the US South.</p>
<p>My own experience with mixed race people is that mixed race men, &#8220;colored&#8221; men like Holder, Obama, Bryant Gumble, Harry Belefonte tend to be extremely anti White, have to prove that they are &#8220;Black enough&#8221;, try to compete with, fight with as many White men as they can and try to have sex with as many White woman as they can. Look at Harry Belefonte&rsquo;s wives, Brian Gumble&rsquo;s mistresses and they go for Black civil rights, ANC, Mugabe politics. </p>
<p>On the other hand, mixed race women are the least anti White and understand how violent and dangerous lower class Black men are, Black Africans are in Africa. So in politics, I recommend people here support responsible, mixed race &#8220;Black&#8221; women.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Kulak, and I hope you&rsquo;re right; you are most optimistic than I am.</p>
<p>I am worried mostly about SCOTUS, about Hate Speech laws that will pass and that will shut us Whites up once and for all   &mdash;     any speech the regime doesn&rsquo;t like such as any of us voicing the following from anon # 25:</p>
<p><i>You couldn&rsquo;t oppose him because of his communist politics, his lies and false promises, and his totalitarian anti-constitutionalist bent, and the fact that he is a Brzezinski and Soros marionnette, it has to be racism.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  will result in punitive fines, loss of job and hard jail time as is happening in Britain and Canada, two places without a First Amendment and with strict speech codes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s England&rsquo;s Hate Speech Law:  <i>Expressions of hatred toward someone on account of that person&rsquo;s colour, race, nationality (including citizenship), ethnic or national origin, religion, or sexual orientation is forbidden.   Any communication which is threatening, abusive or insulting, and is intended to harass, alarm, or distress someone is forbidden. The penalties for hate speech include fines, imprisonment, or both.</i></p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t include Hate Speech against Whites, of course, and Holder has already assured us, in front of congress and news cameras, that Hate Laws do not cover Whites.</p>
<p>And yes, the result of this eventually will be violence, lots of it, civil war and blood shed.  It may or may not end well after the dust settles   &mdash;   as it is, we have 100 million White-hating non-Whites to contend with including in key positions in the military and police forces   &mdash;   and millions more brainwashed Whites as well.</p>
<p>Best to both of you!!<br>

My experience with mulatto women has been the opposite.  As a black female race realist (of Nigerian descent) I often envy my mulatto friends for the attention they get from white men.  I have observed that despite having the option of dating white men they throw themselves at black men.  They also eagerly identify as black and often deny having white heritage.  Some of them are vehemently anti-white and afraid to marry white men for fear of having white children.<br>
 <br>
Anyway, I&rsquo;m thinking of buying the book Injustice for a white liberal friend.</p>

<p>You describe yourself thus: &#8220;As a black female race realist (of Nigerian descent)&#8221;.  Will there over the centuries arise a smart Bantu-derived race in your mind?  I get the feeling the Chinese and Indians are going to help with that.  <br>
The country Ghana I believe had a higher civilization that others, and there are signs that there are some tribes in Africa which may be developing a higher mind (Mali, Ghana, maybe some parts of Nigeria).  <br>
The colonialist Europeans who came said it would take centuries for the African to begin to lift to the European standard.  I feel that this might happen in the distant star trek future.  <br>

		<p>Obama is 50% white? Holder is about 33% white. </p>
<p>Using simple trig in pro-rating racism percentages Obama&rsquo;s claim of racism could never be more than 50% and Holder 66% assuming full tilt racism. </p>
<p>Technically you can split the difference in half on both at best giving benefit of the doubt. </p>
<p>Therefore Obama&rsquo;s claim is only 25% racism and 75% non-racism so it is null and void. </p>
<p>Holder&rsquo;s claim for racism is only 33% thus his claim is likewise null and void with 66% non-racism.</p>

		<p>J. CHRISTIAN ADAMS on HOLDER&rsquo;s &#8216;RACIALIST RADICALISM&rsquo;</p>
<p>and the CLIPPING Holder carries.</p>
<p>Adams blew the whistle on the black racism in the Holder Justice Dept., wrote a book about it - Injustice: Exposing the Racial Agenda of the Obama Justice Department - and now fights it every day. </p>
<p>He posts at Breitbart&rsquo;s BIG GOVERNMENT from time to time.</p>
<p><a href="http://biggovernment.com/author/jcadams" rel="nofollow">http://biggovernment.com/author/jcadams</a></p>
<p>He wrote in a column there 12/11/11</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/rjkyX" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/rjkyX</a></p>
<p>The Fast and Furious scandal isn&rsquo;t the only mess overseen by Eric Holder.  His entire tenure has been characterized by racialist radicalism, disguised to some critics as mere incompetence.  But it is far worse than incompetence, and to think otherwise is a mistake. From the dismissal of the voter intimidation case against racist anti-Semitic New Black Panther thugs, to the Mirandizing of battlefield captures in Afghanistan, Holder has presided over a systemic radicalization of the most powerful federal agency.  This isn&rsquo;t incompetence.  It is radicalism.</p>
<p>Many in Washington remain unconvinced of the extent of the destructive radicalism permeating this administration, and particularly the DOJ.  In the speeches I give around the country, I lament that I wish Bill Clinton was still President.  These are not your grandfather&rsquo;s democrats.  These are not just liberals.  From bringing cases to force schools to allow child transvestites, to forcing schools to give Muslim teachers almost four weeks paid vacation for an Islamic pilgrimage, radicalism prevails.</p>
<p>Ponder the racialist rot that Eric Holder carries in his wallet.  I write in my book &ldquo;Injustice&ldquo; about a clipping he has carried since 1971.  Holder&rsquo;s clipping says:</p>
<p>    Blackness is another issue entirely apart from class in America. No matter how affluent, educated and mobile [a black person] becomes, his race defines him more particularly than anything else. Black people have a common cause that requires attending to, and this cause does not allow for the rigid class separation that is the luxury of American whites. There is a sense in which every black man is as far from liberation as the weakest one if his weakness is attributable to racial injustice.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Injustice,&rdquo; I note:</p>
<p>    When asked to explain the passage, Holder replied, &ldquo;It really says that &hellip; I am not the tall U.S. attorney, I am not the thin United States Attorney. I am the black United States attorney. And he was saying that no matter how successful you are, there&rsquo;s a common cause that bonds the black United States attorney with the black criminal or the black doctor with the black homeless person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you witness Holder&rsquo;s contempt for the rule of law, his disdain for enforcing civil rights and voting laws equally regardless of the race of the victim, and his disdain toward members of Congress, this quote explains a great deal.</p>

If the Republicans (in whom I really have no faith but what else is there?) were smart they&rsquo;d beat that drum and harp on the fact that Obama and Holder are interested only in what advances Blacks. </p>

<p>I agree with you that mixed race women identify themselves as &#8220;Black&#8221; - as it helps them in politics, affirmative action etc. I don&rsquo;t see them &#8220;trowing themselves&#8221; at (poor, working class) Black men, these Black men are certainly after them, after most any women, especially fat White women.</p>
<p>But, my experience is that mixed race, lighter &#8220;Black&#8221; women do not have the chip on their shoulder hatred of Whites that mixed race men like Holder do. Mixed race women are generally well aware of the short comings of Black men, lower class Blacks and politics aside, they will seek to live apart from the worse Black areas and at least be fair with Whites. </p>
<p>Look at South Africa - the &#8220;coloreds&#8221; live/move to the Cape where Blacks are not the majority.<br>

		<p>This Eric Holder is a disgrace to the office of Attorney General and reflects the poor judgement, racism, and incompetence of the president himself. If I were Obama I would dump this jerk in a heart beat before he does any more damage. However to stick by Holder will squash any chance of Obama being re-elected which is a good thing. <br>
  It&rsquo;s easy to see by the actions of Eric Holder during the past four years that he has a hatred and contempt for all white people, the U.S.A., and the laws of our land. How quickly we forget, during the last election we all saw the video of Black Panther thugs and in particular King Samir Shabaz threatening white people with weapons and vile racist remarks who was later caught on video saying &#8220;I hate white people with every iota&#8221;, and &#8220;kill all white crackers and their white cracker babies&#8221; and then we find out these hate mongers were charged with nothing by the DOJ and Eric Holder even said &#8220;blacks will not be charged with voter intimidation or fraud&#8221;. So we have a Attorney General that not only does not enforce laws because of racism but makes up his own laws because of his very own brand of racism.  <br>
   Then we have this same racist idiot &#8220;Eric Holder&#8221; threatening and suing states for daring to enforce immigration laws and constantly attacking a great Sheriff called Joe Arpaio for enforcing immigration laws, next the fool &#8220;Eric Holder is now threatening and suing states that demand voters have a ID in order to vote. Can you imagine that? what planet does this guy come from? I have been voting here in CT since I was old enough to vote and have always presented an ID and doing so has never presented a hardship or even a second thought. <br>
    It&rsquo;s obvious  that Obama won the last election through voter intimidation and fraud and they intend to do it again this coming election but the American people are waking up to the wicked ways of the left and this is why Obama has sent his hit man Eric Holder out there to make sure ID&rsquo;S are taboo because according to corrupt policies of the left dead people must vote, the same person must vote as often as possible, illegals must vote, felons must vote, and all enemies of the U.S.A. must vote. Well! good luck with all that MR Attorney General and MR President because the American people are not going to be that stupid the next time around.  We are aware that there are certain factions out from around the world that want to corrupt the U.S.A. from within but it&rsquo;s not going to happen. Go back to school Soros!    </p>
