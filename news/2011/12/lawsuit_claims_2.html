<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Kansas City, Mo., police patrolman claims he was demoted because his skin is white.</p>
<p>Patrolman Chad Rives filed a lawsuit on Dec. 5 and claims he was demoted out of the homicide unit where he was detective. The lawsuit lists three police department managers who are African-American. {snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims a &#8220;Gang of 8″ was formed to protect and promote black officers. The lawsuit also goes into detail about Rives&rsquo; employment record, stating that as a homicide detective, Rives achieved a high homicide solve rate, didn&rsquo;t have any disciplinary action against him and received positive evaluations. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit claims the discrimination has caused him loss of sleep, anxiety and prevented him from competing on a level playing field with African-American employees.</p>

		<p>This is exactly what Chittum predicted in his book, Civil War II.  The police departments will become radicalized. The inner city departments will turn dark, the suburban, small town, and rural will be white. There will be skirmishes and battles between them. Eventually that will escalate even further. In Florida there is already aggression between the State Police and, I believe, the North Miami Beach Police department, if memory serves me (I don&rsquo;t live there). I do not know if that conflict is at all based on race but the media whores will hide it if it is.</p>

		<p>There was a website several years ago, www.domelight.com, which was operated primarily by white police officers in the Philadelphia area. It has since been dismantled due to complaints from the &#8220;brothers&#8221; on the PD in Philadelphia from what I understand. </p>
<p>It was a sounding board for such crap as we read here about KCPD.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t allowed, which totally violated their own First Amendment rights. I would like to think that somewhere there is indeed a big, big resistance movement in place attempting to counteract this virulent form of prejudice and racism. Otherwise<br>
we are doomed as a race.<br>

		<p>The last mayor of Kansas City, a white liberal panderer, actually broached the idea of letting people with adult felony criminal records become KCPD cops.  Why?  You guessed it.  Too few blacks.  Now, some cities are so desperate for blacks that they&rsquo;re ignoring juvenile felony convictions, but a juvenile felony isn&rsquo;t a gun disqualifier, an adult felony is.  So, Mark Funkhouser wanted people who legally can&rsquo;t own guns to possess guns as KCPD cops.</p>

		<p>This case is similar to a Supreme Ct case out of New Haven, Co.<br>
The city fire dept. had a promotional test and 19 whites and 1 Hispanic passed.  No blacks passed so the first test was invalidated by the city because no blacks passed. The firemen who passed sued and the case made it to the USSC. The court held that the City&rsquo;s decision to ignore the first test violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the 20 who passed the test were promoted. (Ricci v. DeStefano 129 S.Ct. 2658 (2009)</p>
<p>Maybe the white KC officers should read this case!<br>

		<p>I had a black manager in the corporate world who would NOT promote a white male.  </p>
<p>He was eventually fired for sexual harassment of women who just happened to be white.  One of the white women told me about his advances.</p>
<p>I wonder what ever happened to that guy? </p>

		<p>I saw this happening 40 years ago in the military, I knew of several black NCO&rsquo;s who would make sure &#8220;a young brother&#8221; would get put in for promotion at the earliest opportunity but if you were white they could care less and you had to wait until someone else in the chain of command came along.</p>

		<p>Ah, another example of white privilege harming blacks when they are in power to discriminate against whites to better one of their own.  Hey, little Timmy Wise, did you hear about this?</p>

		<p>As poster #5 mentioned, I also had a supervisor once who was black.  He was an obvious affirmative action appointment - way out of his league.  He let the black employees under his watch run amok, while harassing all non-black employees.  He was particularly hard on the asians for some reason.  I actually transfered out of that place due to his pressure and veiled threats to get me canned.  He was removed for incompetence about two years later.</p>

		<p>Erm, isn&rsquo;t &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221;, or &#8220;AA&#8221;, supposed to prevent &#8220;him from competing on a level playing field with African-American employees&#8221;?</p>
<p>Wait until YT is a minority.</p>
