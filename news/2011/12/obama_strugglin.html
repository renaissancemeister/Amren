			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Jackson, USA Today, December 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor Poll details President Obama&rsquo;s slippage with various voting groups  &mdash;  particularly white voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, Obama has slipped from 52.8% of the vote in 2008 to 44% approval in the new survey with 49% disapproving,&#8221; writes Ronald Brownstein of National Journal.</p>
<p>Brownstein also says that &#8220;Obama has declined not only in the groups that were always dubious of him, but also with several that enthusiastically joined his winning 2008 majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>That includes college educated women who backed Obama over John McCain in 2008. In fact, Brownstein writes, &#8220;Obama is now facing dismal approval ratings in all corners of the white community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brownstein&rsquo;s analysis:</p>
<blockquote>In 2008, he carried 52% of those college-educated white women, but attracted much smaller shares among college-educated white men (42%), white women without a college degree, the so-called waitress moms (41%), and the non-college white men (just 39%).
<p>The new survey shows that with all four groups his approval rating is appreciably lower than his 2008 performance. He&rsquo;s fallen to 42% of the college-educated white women, 37% among the college-plus white men, just 34% among the non-college white men and all the way down to 30% with the waitress moms.</p>
<p>Looking at whites by age underlines the picture of broad-based weakness. In 2008, Obama carried a 54% majority of whites under 30; but in the new poll his approval rating with them has tumbled to 39%.</p>
<p>His standing with white seniors now is almost identical: in 2008, he won only 40% of them, and his approval rating with them now is 41%. His numbers are lowest with whites in the prime working years: just 29% of whites (age) 30-44, and 35 % of whites (age) 45-64 say they approve of his performance. In 2008, he won 41% of the former and 42% of the latter.</p>
<p>Among all whites, now just 35% approve of his performance and 58% disapprove. That&rsquo;s virtually identical to the results in the 2010 congressional election, when whites gave 60% of their votes to Republicans and just 37% to Democrats, according to the National Election Pool exit poll conducted by Edison Research&hellip; .  </p>

		<p>I want to find myself one of the 70% of &#8216;waitress moms&rsquo; and have about ten kids with her. It is interesting how college actually dumbs-down White women. Of course no offense meant to the 58% who dare to be unfashionable and give a negative rating to President Camacho. </p>
<p>Long ago I had a brief romance with an intelligent young lass in her senior year of high school. I must have been all of 19 or 20 at the time. She graduated and enrolled in NYU. A few years later I was happy to run into her again&hellip;.until she opened her mouth and recited the Marxist mantra. She became someone who &#8216;unlearned&rsquo; reality. At university she was deconstructed. The only good news is that according to friends she has a White baby. </p>

		<p>He may be slipping but it&rsquo;s also true you can&rsquo;t beat somebody with nobody. The Republicans are just staging a circus with their clown of the month routine. They don&rsquo;t seem to be serious about winning in 2012, otherwise they&rsquo;d show more focus and resolve. </p>

		<p>This is much ado about nothing. The percentages of support Obama has among White voters has not dropped enough to prevent him from getting re-elected next year. He will almost certainly get re-elected given this current GOP field. </p>
<p>This is just a a diversionary tactic promoted by the lamestream media to psychologically mess with his strongest supporters and detractors.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a little strange that the diverse white Americans didn&rsquo;t understand that Obama was smearing them when he pushed a black slur (&#8220;acting white&#8221;) into the mainstream media in 2004 at the Democratic Convention.  &#8220;Acting white&#8221; says as clear as it can be said that Obama defines us as lacking any variety or differences as well as lacking American nationality&hellip;two qualities he claims for his own people.</p>
<p>He double-downed on his bigotry when he slammed his white grandmother as &#8220;a typical white person&#8221; in remarks in 2008.  Once again, we&rsquo;re just clones of each other and we don&rsquo;t deserve the label of &#8220;Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still if the diverse white Americans are understanding his hatreds now, that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>

		<p>Obama has bought the public sector workers, those on state handouts &amp; areas privileged by the Democrats, but there is now no idealism out there, no youthful enthusiasm &amp; little sex appeal to women. He&rsquo;s just got his client group, racial loyalists &amp; die hard lefties. Its a pretty sad constituency which a decent opponent should push aside.</p>

<p>I sincerely believe the die-hard libs will vote for him again without giving it a second thought. In fact, I&rsquo;d go as far as to say that at least 95% of the mentally-ill who voted this mindless man in will vote for him again. Sad, but true.</p>

		<p>Obama couldn&rsquo;t deliver on his promises of a shining utopia of peace and prosperity for all.  </p>
<p>By itself it is not unusual for a president not to succeed in everything he promised, but unlike ALL past presidents, Obama came with a package that was much more than just economic programs or foreign policy goals.  </p>
<p>He came with a messianic vision directed at the least rational members of our society, namely young women, &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; men, minorities of all kinds who fail to measure up to modern standards, some conservatives who tired of Bush and his puppet masters, and hippie-liberal leftists who drink too much kool-aid all the time.</p>
<p>Obama failed all groups who were literally expecting &#8216;transformative&rsquo; effects on all of society.  Change is slow and a president can only do so much, which is what most people fail to realize.</p>
<p>The loony bins of the world have no patience, they are all about change, and change NOW!  So they are turning on their patron saint like a pack of rabid mongrels.<br>

		<p>Sadly, the only republican candidate I like out of the pack is Bachmann. Michele Bachmann has very little chance of getting the nod, and even if she it would just be an entire year of purely negative press coverage, with the near complete omission of anything on her agenda that would actually resonate with votes or be good for the nation. </p>
<p><br>
The media coverage the last go round was extremely biased, and I have no reason not to expect the same for the next election. Just an example, two people on her staff quit because she didn&rsquo;t use their idea in the primary campaign. The news media portrayed the event as &#8220;entire Bachmann staff walks out in disgust with candidate&#8221;. Even after the news media knew the story wasn&rsquo;t true, they continued to run with it for another 3 weeks while omitting virtually anything she actually said over the same time period?  Its not even news coverage when all it amounts to is getting smeared, and ignored at the same time. Forget any duty to inform the public. </p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t think we can expect more when the people who are the real owners of those presses, the investment bankers, make up a very large number Obama appointments. Some of them would be facing indictment for the trillions of dollars of fraud they are personally responsible for if we had an honest administration. </p>
<p>This will be another election where I&rsquo;m forced to either vote 3rd party (flush!) or vote against someone rather than for them. </p>
<p>My best prediction is that we are stuck with Obama for another 4 miserable years in an election that will be very close despite those approval ratings. He may not even win the popular vote, but he will carry enough electoral votes that he still gets into office.  </p>

		<p>It should be interesting to see how the imminent &#8220;racism&#8221; angle to this is spun. How, one wonders, is it it to be explained that many who enthusiastically approved of Obama three years ago have suddenly become so &#8220;racist&#8221; as to oppose him now? Alas, there is NO other explanation for disliking him, or so we have been told over and over again! </p>

		<p>Given that Obammy and Eric &#8220;Banjo&#8221; Holder have gone out of their way to alienate, and screw over the white population this is no surprise. Add to that their effort to set white Americans up for a massive bloodbath and genocide at the hands of rampaging blacks, jihadists and Mestizos, he&rsquo;s done more to arouse fear and anger among whites and done more to promote white nationalism than anyone else ever could.</p>

		<p>This is the foremost reason that the Left is working so hard to ELECT A NEW PEOPLE. </p>
<p>We have seen the Dept of Homeland Security&rsquo;s immigration and border tasks completely turned upside down, from the old imperatives of guarding the border, blocking unauthorized persons from entry, finding them if they get in and removing them, to the new task of actively preventing the old tasks from being performed and preventing the states from performing them instead, intimidating anyone from complaining about the invasion, while other elements of leftist-controlled government do everything they can to assist, even subsidize the invaders and even favor them over the natives.</p>
<p>All of this is so blatantly and brazenly done yet without much concern about public outrage (much less impeachment) because the decades of multicultural indoctrination have succeeded so well and the organs of public discourse and opinion propagation are so thoroughly dominated by the Left.</p>
<p>As many have noted, without the internet hardly a peep of indignation would reach anyone beyond the reach of your own voice under your own roof.</p>
<p>Even the supposedly conservative party and media barely mention the treason in anything like the blunt terms that it deserves. By this I mean objecting to the radical demographic change that is brought about by legal immigration and objecting to the multicultural dogma itself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I do believe that more and more ordinary people are becoming apostates from multicultural dogma. The task is to get their voices into the broader public arena, for each of us to help empower others by conveying to them the legitimacy, necessity, and urgency of speaking the truth about the threat to our nation and casting off fear of disapproval.</p>
<p>Many, many people are thinking as we do. We need to create a climate in which they can &#8216;come out of the closet&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Put simply - be outspoken for our issue and see how many others will begin to speak out.</p>
<p>Remember the &#8216;I am Spartacus&rsquo; moment. Of course all those people were crucified as I recall. OK, bad analogy you may say but they were literally slaves and we are not. Not by a long shot.</p>

		<p>I have the misfortune of being surrounded by leftards at work. They are insane and make statements like: &#8220;I was born a Democrat, my whole family is a Democrat family, it is almost like I was kinda brainwashed that way.&#8221; I fool you not. That is word for word what one of them said to me last week. They then went on to say that they &#8220;wished Bill Clinton was king.&#8221; Again exact wording. They made the Clinton for King comment after blasting Herman Cain for lying about his obvious infidelity. It was nuts. </p>

		<p>Also another one of the leftards at work went on and on about wonderful Obama is and great of a job he is doing cleaning up &#8221; Bush&rsquo;s mess.&#8221; And then went on to say that anyone who can&rsquo;t see that is a racist. Later that same week she overheard me mentioning the local crime wave that took the life of a 5yr old girl that attended my children&rsquo;s school. This leftard pulled me aside and quietly said &#8220;well that&rsquo;s what happens when a bunch of blacks move in.&#8221; What breathtaking hypocrisy. They don&rsquo;t truly believe their own nonsense.</p>

		<p>If as many non-college-educated people voted as do college-educated, no one like Obama would ever be elected President.  The former has to see an election as something that matters  &mdash;  that it&rsquo;s not simply business as usual or more of the same.  During Ohio&rsquo;s vote on same-sex marriage, people of all classes, educations, and ethnicities came out in droves.  Same-sex marriage was outlawed in the state by amendment  &mdash;  and George W. Bush was given Ohio&rsquo;s electoral votes.  </p>
<p>Obama was elected because too many &#8220;waitress moms&#8221; and other pink-collar and blue-collar folks didn&rsquo;t think it mattered whether he or John McCain was elected.  Or they thought a radical black man could never be chosen, so they didn&rsquo;t bother to vote.  </p>
<p>Obama received about 44% of the white vote.  He&rsquo;s bound to receive less than that this time because people of both the left and right are disappointed with his performance.  A lot of people won&rsquo;t be enthused enough to go to the polls, and that includes blacks.  The GOP candidate, whoever he is, cannot lose if enough anti-Obama whites actually vote.  </p>
<p>Remember, too, that the Republican Party is stuck with whatever candidates choose to run.  And primary voters, with their ballots, have the final say.  </p>

During the 1970s the white working class left the Democratic Party and became a Republican constituency. This was good for Republican politicians and their upper class constituents. <br>
 <br>
For the white working class results were mixed. The crime rate has declined since 1980 because the prison population has increased.<br>

 <br>
This probably would not have happened if the Democrats had retained the control of the United States they had during the 1960s.<br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, it cannot be said that white blue collar workers have benefited economically from the Republican ascendancy that their support has made possible. Since 1980 after tax income for eighty percent of the country has declined.<br>

A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows the president leading Romney 47-45%, and Gingrich 51-40%. USA Today and Gallup give Obama a 47-46% advantage over Romney, and 50-44% over Gingrich. And a Reuters/Ipsos poll puts Obama ahead 48-40% over Romney, and 51-38% over the former House speaker.<br>

President Obama has orchestrated the killing of Osama bin Laden, and ended American military involvement in Iraq is a manner that so far seems to amount to a successful conclusion. <br>
 <br>
Since reaching a height of 10.1 percent in October 2009, unemployment has gradually declined to 8.6 percent in November 2011. Under Ronald Reagan unemployment reached 10.8 percent.<br>

 <br>
A lot can happen between now and next November. The economy is still fragile. Iraq could erupt into a civil war. Nevertheless, if things continue to improve the President could be reelected by a comfortable margin. The Republicans are not offering an attractive alternative.<br>
 <br>
The Republican Party reminds me of the Democratic Party during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Democrats were moving to the left because of the War in Vietnam. Because of the black ghetto riots, the rise in crime, affirmative action, and forced school busing the electorate was moving to the right.<br>
 <br>
Currently the Republican Party is moving to the right. Because of the growing income gap the electorate seems to be moving to the left on economic issues. There is little support for cuts in Social Security and Medicate. There is much support for more progressive taxation.<br>

Marxism has not been fashionable on college campuses since the War in Vietnam. Even then it was a minority persuasion. <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, college graduates, and especially those with professional degrees from elite universities, can usually afford to live in safe neighborhoods. They are safe because they are far from black ghettos. Those people usually have contact with few blacks. Those few are exceptional, or they occupy subordinate positions without resentment.<br>
 <br>
White blue collar workers are less fortunate. They are more likely to be victims of black crime, and affirmative action. This in turn influences their attitudes about the Democratic Party. </p>

		<p>At comment number seventeen. I was also raised a Democrat. My dad was a Democrat, his dad was a Democrat. At twenty nine years old in 1987, my thoughts about politics and the media were this simple. Democrats were the good guys who were for the little guy. The Republicans were the bad guys that were for the rich guys. Democrats were open minded, Republicans were close minded. The media was conservative and supported the Republicans. I think there were tens of millions of guys just like me. Some of us have had awakenings (no doubt brought about in many different ways for many different reasons) and some of us haven&rsquo;t. But, it would be my belief that few of us who changed our minds did it over nite and few of us who changed our minds did it as the result of someone personally presenting an argument to us that changed our minds. Something happened to us or we witnessed something that made us begin to look at things from a different perspective and then one little mind opening step led to another&hellip;</p>

I personally would vote for Obama before I would vote for Gingrich.  At least the Republicans would continue to be a check on power then.  Who knows what crazy thing Newt would do?</p>

<p>John Englemann.  You obviously have not been on a college campus since the 1950&rsquo;s.  The campuses are still totally Marxist.  They have added anti White racism, virulent anti Christianity, insane environmentalism such as the anti tree pruning movement, insanely pro gay transgender, NAMBLA propaganda and all sorts of other Marxist genocidal propaganda against Whites.</p>
<p>Consider Bernadine Dorhn who admits and boasts of planting the bomb that killed on and blinded another San Francisco police officer is now a senior professor at Northwestern Law School in Evanston, Illinois.  She cannot be admitted to the Illinois bar because of her felonies, but Northwestern gave her the job of Professor because law professors don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be members of the bar.</p>
<p>Her first, very first job at Northwestern was not instructor or even professor who actually had to teach a few classes a week.</p>
<p>She was made executive director of Northwestern&rsquo;s family, children and domestic law center.  Her very first job out of prison, she made more money that the tenured professors at the top of their salary range.</p>
<p>Read the newspapers of your local campuses.  From Podunk Community College to Harvard, the all spew the same Marxist hatred of Whites and western Civilization, especially Christianity.</p>

<p>You could not be more wrong.  Classes in overt Marxist studies and party membersship might not be popular, but Marxist assumptions and method has permeated the college and university campuses since the 1960s. The socialist environment of the typical campus is undeniable.   Speakers have often had their microphones shut off, conservative student groups attacked, denied operation, etc.  Why do you think conservative groups or individual speakers have such a hard time establishing or maintaining any presence on the typical campus? </p>

		<p>Modern Colleges largely spread a post-Christian religion which teaches that:</p>
<p>1. Evolution definitely exists, to believe otherwise would make you a stupid Christian Hick, but evolution suddenly stopped 30,000 years ago for human beings;</p>
<p>2. Despite 150 years of intense government investment into submarine battery technologies that can successfully keep modern boats moving slowly for a few hours with the lights turned off, electricity can now magically be stored in amounts capable of sustaining the modern electrical grid at night, or when the wind stops; and </p>
<p>3. Submit your individualism to a one world government or the 0.02 degree per decade temperature increase we observed over the last ten years will continue and you and your loved ones will die a horrific death in the coming hell-fire.</p>
<p>This would be a funny religion if it were not currently in charge of a nuclear-armed state. Observing the leader of this Church read its teachings through a teleprompter over a period of years just might be increasing the number of aware Americans. President Obama and the people who surround him are the teachable moment.<br>

I have known Marxists. I liked several of them, although we disagreed on specific issues. Marxists do not hide what they are and what they believe in.<br>
 <br>
In contemporary political discussions the word &#8220;Marxist&#8221; is used as carelessly as the word &#8220;racist,&#8221; and in much the same way. In either case the words are used to derogate rather than to describe, and to suppress a discussion of controversial issues, rather than to advance it.  </p>

		<p>After learning about &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution,&#8221; on American Renaissance, I bought the book, read it, find it fascinating, and continue to re read it.<br>

On page 111 the authors write: &#8220;Aggressive, combative people may have also experienced lowered fitness once ruling elites began to appear. With strong states, the personal payoff for aggression may have become smaller, while law and order made combativeness for self-defense less necessary.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
Republicans generally are hostile to the government, and particularly to gun control laws. They think they should be able to protect themselves from the government. They also think that if they are allowed to own guns they can protect themselves from criminals, and do not really need the police.<br>
 <br>
White and Asian Democrats usually like the government, and support strict gun control laws. This indicates a more evolved attitude.<br>
 <br>
The authors of &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion&#8221; explain how the Ashkenazic Jews evolved in an almost exclusively urban environment, surviving by their brains, more than their biceps. <br>
 <br>
Asian, and particularly Chinese, governments have always been authoritarian. They have had effective ways to reward deference and to punish insubordination.<br>
 <br>
Jews and Asians usually vote Democrat, even when they are prosperous, as they often are. If my analysis of &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion&#8221; is correct, this is likely to continue.  </p>

<p>Yes, it has many masks.  Marxism and Marxism-Leninism, as an attempt at an integral (but activist/engineering)  worldview deserve our respect and not merely our study but our appreciation/understanding    &mdash;   and our discriminating and thus emphatic rejection.  To evade the insights of the Marxists is to cheat ourselves.  To be taken in by their dreamy desires and by their adroitly formulated confusions is to utterly negate and debase ourselves.  It&rsquo;s a balancing act.  What in Marxism is at odds with &#8220;Jensenism&#8221;??</p>
<p>I realize that Sartre&rsquo;s statement :  &#8220;HUMANS are everywhere and always EQUAL&#8221; is a brilliant truth at the ideal level of dialectics  &mdash;  the interpenetration of opposites to yield a dialectical (ideal / activist-engineer ) truth.  We don&rsquo;t apply something like this to which of five available mechanics of varying aptitude we wish to handle the front-end alignment and brake maintenance on our family car.  Nor should we.  </p>

		<p>It is shocking to me that the favorable, or &#8220;approval&#8221;, percentages are that high.  While an American president has much less power than most citizens believe, it seems that Obama receives very little blame for the bad things he&rsquo;s done, especially the executive orders.  </p>
<p>That said, he will be re-elected.  There are too many people of all groups (white, black, poor, elderly, on-the-dole, etc.) who will vote for him.  Also, I strongly believe that people will vote for a third party candidate which always takes votes away from the Republican party.  I also believe many will stay away from the polls for two reasons: one, they figure Obama will be re-elected anyway and two, people fear rioting will occur if he isn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>This article from a conservative publication may or may not be true.  It is similiar to many hope springs eternal articles.</p>
<p><br>
Obama To Clinton: &#8220;You&rsquo;re A Racist.&#8221; Clinton Calls Obama: &#8220;The Worst President Ever.&#8221; <br>
Only one week after reporting that Michelle Obama may be having a &#8220;steamy secret affair&#8221; with a Secret Service agent, The Globe has just unleashed another bombshell that may very well sink the foundering Obama Regime.  According to the Globe, long-standing tensions between Barack Obama and Bill Clinton reached the boiling point during a recent golf outing at Andrews Air Force Base.</p>
<p>According to multiple unnamed sources, Clinton has been confiding to close pals that Obama is &#8220;the worst President ever&#8221; and his presidency is a &#8220;sinking ship&#8221; that is &#8220;taking the Democratic party and the country down with him,&#8221; and when Obama confronted him on the comments, Clinton looked him in the eye and said; &#8220;Yes, it&rsquo;s a fact.&#8221;  The Globe reports: &#8220;At that point, the source adds, Obama went ballistic and told the ex-Prez; &#8216;Then you are a racist and no different than the rest of them.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly much more to this story than a gossipy accusation from a supermarket tabloid. While the information apparently comes from multiple unnamed sources, it is not in dispute that there is a long history of disgusting and highly politicized accusations of racism against Clinton from Obama&rsquo;s surrogates over the years.  During the 2008 primary campaign, CNN political analyst Donna Brazile, Obama spokeswoman Candice Tolliver and a number of others repeatedly implied that Clinton&rsquo;s comments on Obama&rsquo;s lack of experience and his &#8220;fairy-tale image&#8221; were racially motivated. </p>
<p>And charges of racism against Clinton by Team Obama have not gone away.  As recent as January of 2010, Al Sharpton played the race card against Clinton in reference to Obama on the Sean Hannity show, and the ongoing onslaught of accusations is clearly getting under Clinton&rsquo;s skin.   In September of 2009, Clinton even went so far as to defend conservatives against slanderous accusations by former-President Jimmy Carter that racism drives Obama&rsquo;s opponents: &#8220;I believe that 100 percent of those who are opposing him now would be against him if he were a white Democrat.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the media perpetually attempts to sugar-coat Obama&rsquo;s falling poll numbers, it is secretly and widely acknowledged, even from within Obama&rsquo;s inner circle, that his presidency is a &#8220;sinking ship.&#8221;  Fox News Political analyst, Pat Caddell, a life-long Democratic operative recently stated: &#8220;He&rsquo;s [Obama] in deep trouble&#8221; and added, &#8220;Even if he wins, he can&rsquo;t govern.&#8221;  Previously, Caddell went on record to say what is now, only a whisper in the corridors of power in Washington; namely, that Obama should announce that he is not going to seek a second term: &ldquo;Obama should announce immediately that he will not be a candidate for reelection in 2012.&#8221; Caddell added that Obama &ldquo;has largely lost the consent of the governed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And polling numbers only drive the point home.  A recent Associated Press poll indicates that 52 percent of Americans believe &#8220;Obama should be voted out of office&#8221; and only 43 percent believe Obama deserves reelection.  Interestingly, when Time Magazine reported the poll results, the editors spun the results and reported in the article&rsquo;s headline that Obama&rsquo;s reelection chances were &#8220;50-50.&#8221;  The Associated Press, in its reporting, also editorialized the results claiming that for &#8220;the first time&#8221; a majority of adults &#8220;believe that Obama should be voted out of office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the &#8220;first time.&#8221;  Back in April of 2010, CNN reported that &#8220;52 percent said the President does not deserve to be re-elected, while 44 percent said that he does&#8221; and while Obama&rsquo;s poll numbers go up and down, they have trended dangerously low over the past two years and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to spin what is becoming a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The recent resurgence of the Obama-Clinton feud doesn&rsquo;t help matters for Obama.  It&rsquo;s no secret that Hillary Clinton, even if Obama pulls off a miracle and wins reelection, will not serve another term as Secretary of State and abandonment by the Clintons will certainly mean that Obama will have difficulty in raising the one billion dollars that he anticipates putting into his campaign coffers.  </p>

<p>I have worked at a university in Southern California for the last five years. Yes, some of the liberal arts courses are marxist and  anti-American. I also believe that affirmative action is a racist system. We haven&rsquo;t had that in years, but they are trying to bring it back. The rest of your post sounds borderline insane. Marxist genocidal propaganda against whites?? NAMBLA?? (that&rsquo;s my favorite). Whites are a minority in this school, but I have never heard a racial slur, and I&rsquo;ve never been attacked in any way.  Also, as in most places, I see a handful of gays that keep to themselves. I don&rsquo;t see them harrassing anyone or promoting child-rape though&hellip;sorry, I&rsquo;ve just never seen them do that. </p>
<p>My point is, you really need to get out into the world. You need to seperate the good from the bad. Do tell the truth. Do make statements for your cause, but back them up with facts. At the moment, you sound like a raving lunatic. That does not help this cause in any way.</p>

		<p>Here is another story out of Indianapolis where a 21 year old and his 7 year old niece (read that again folks – 7 year old) were both shot in the head following a robbery in their home. The local news is now reporting a suspect has been arrested and they alluded that the suspect was involved in another crime a year or two ago; and the perps in that crime were, you guessed it, BLACK.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago a couple of diversities killed a Mexican family and it wasn&rsquo;t long before one the guy turned him self in. My theory as to why he turned his self in is because the Hispanic community had threatened to kill the perps family if he hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anyway, this just sickens me. I&rsquo;m sure once they release a pic of the perp on the news website there will be those commenters that will say that all races commit crime. That&rsquo;s true but I challenge them to show how many Whites go around and rob then brutally kill the victims. Blacks and their liberal enablers need to know that we are sick of this and that it&rsquo;s time for us to start marching and protesting in the streets.</p>

<p>John:</p>
<p>If things are improving, and I find scant evidence that they are, as QE3 is about to be unleashed   &mdash;  AND, do not throw the latest unemployment figures at me, it is December and unemployment is not counted the same way as it was under Reagan, hasn&rsquo;t been since 1994   &mdash;   it will NOT be because of 0bama or his policies.</p>
<p>It will be because of gridlock created by Republicans in congress.  Gridlock allows 0bama to blame Republicans for &#8220;not solving the financial crisis&#8221; that 0bama&rsquo;s own spending created AND, it also prevents government intervention in the economy as when the Demos controlled both Houses of Congress. This means the market has a chance to recover on its own before the next election.</p>
<p>0bama will take full credit, of course, claiming such as a result of his own policies, and blasted throughout the pro-0bama media.</p>
<p>I cannot understand how any White could even <i>think</i> of voting for 0bama; it completely baffles me.  Maybe you can make it clear to me as to how another four years of 0bama&rsquo;s regime would be in my best interest and that of other Whites.</p>
<p>Here are two major reasons NO White should ever vote for 0bama:</p>
<p>1. SCOTUS appointee (s).</p>
<p>2.  Eric Holder.</p>

To the best of my knowledge no prominent academics and social thinkers in the United States call themselves &#8220;cultural Marxists.&#8221; The values, concerns, and goals of social liberals merit criticism, but calling social liberals &#8220;cultural Marxists&#8221; does not advance a discussion, and does not seem intended to. <br>
 <br>
Karl Marx concerned himself exclusively with economics. His ignorance, or at least his indifference, to cultural factors is a major deficiency of his political philosophy. </p>

It is easier to justify a vote against the Republican presidential nominee than in favor of President Obama. None of the Republicans have a credible plan to reduce unemployment. None indicate any concern for the fact that the rich keep getting richer, as the standard of living for most Americans declines. None of the Republican candidates demonstrate a firm commitment to Social Security and Medicare. <br>
 <br>
We can never know what would have happened of John McCain had been elected president with a Republican Congress. Many economists believe President Obama&rsquo;s actions averted a Second Great Depression. Nevertheless, economists cannot prove their theories the way those in the natural sciences can with controlled, repeatable experiments. <br>
 <br>
I think Hillary Clinton would do a better job than Barack Obama simply because she seems to have more IQ power. Also, with the Clinton&rsquo;s if you elect one, you get one free. Nevertheless, you don&rsquo;t vote for the candidate you want; you vote for the candidate you have. None of the Republicans presidential candidates are acceptable to me. I will not waste my vote on a third party candidate. <br>

WASHINGTON  &mdash;  Murders, rapes and other violent crimes dropped sharply in the United States in the first six months of 2011, continuing a downward trend that has lasted 4 1/2 years, the FBI reported on Monday. </p>
<p>The federal law enforcement agency said preliminary January-through-June figures showed the number of violent crimes declined 6.4 percent from the previous year, led by a 5.7 percent drop in murders and a 5.1 percent decrease in rapes.</p>
<p>In other violent crime categories, robberies declined 7.7 percent while aggravated assaults fell 5.9 percent.<br>
<a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45723701/ns/us_news/" rel="nofollow">https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45723701/ns/us_news/</a><br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
During the 1960s the Democrats earned a reputation for being soft on crime. Liberal Democrats claimed that the way to reduce crime was to &#8220;get to the root cause&#8221; by reducing poverty. Poverty was reduced by an expanding economy, and War on Poverty Programs. Nevertheless, the crime rate doubled during that decade.<br>
 <br>
Since 1980 poverty has increased because of changes in the economy and reductions in welfare spending. Nevertheless, the crime rate has declined because the prison population has more than tripled. <br>
 <br>
Although the overall crime rate began to decline with the inauguration of President Reagan, the rate of violent crime did not begin its decline until the inauguration of President Clinton, who sighed the Omnibus Crime Bill in 1994.<br>

		<p>The much more concerning issue is why Obama has any white voters whatsoever.  He&rsquo;s openly racist against us.  He says repeatedly, aggressively and in print how much he hates us.  He has connections to group (like the weathermen) who openly promote white genocide.</p>
<p>Turn this around.  A mulatto candidate who openly vilifies his contaminated bloodline with blacks, who openly despises them and has ties to fringe groups among the K who want to round up blacks and exterminate them.</p>
<p>Would any blacks voting for such a candidate be reasonable?  Hell no.  And any whites voting for Obama are out of their minds to do so.</p>

<p>What agenda might that be?  You have more rights than I do because YOU homosexuals now constitute a favored, protected, political class even demanding AA favoritism in jobs and promotions.</p>
<p>No one promotes &#8220;gays as pedophiles&#8221; or claims &#8220;homosexuals are child rapists&#8221;, I have not heard one word of this in the press as pertains to Sundusky or Fine or anyone else.  The msm is wholly on your side.</p>

<p>I have no issue with gays, I am a libertarian, however, I am against militant lefties of whatever ilk demanding and receiving government grated rights and special protections over and above mine, nullifying equal protection under the law.<br>

<p>As much as I would like to think the Republican Presidential contenders not named Ron Paul wouldn&rsquo;t be so stupid to provoke another trillion dollar war when we have a national debt the size of our GDP and an annual budget deficit bigger than the entire Federal spending budget a dozen years ago, you are probably right.  Neo and lamer cons try to respond by saying that they aren&rsquo;t advocating a full on war with Iran.  The problem is, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll end up with if our response to Iranian nuclear ambitions is anything more than fortifying our own border security.  Really, and what I&rsquo;m about to say sounds demented, but I actually *hope* that Iran is enriching uranium to build a conventional nuclear weapon, because that is the &#8220;devil you know&#8221; alternative to the &#8220;devil you don&rsquo;t,&#8221; that is, stuffing enriched uranium into suitcases and deploying the suitcases all over the world.  When they go off, Iran has plausible deniability.  With a conventional nuke, not only is it more obvious, but the old established chess game of mutually assured destruction comes into play, and once Ahmadinejad gets the big red button on my desk, one would hope that it does for him what getting a carry permit did for me, i.e. making us realize that the &#8220;stuff&#8221; is now real, and serve to calm us down and make us learn how to be good cowards.  A big red button on his desk might actually serve to end the apocalyptic millenarian fundamentalist Islamic rhetoric coming out of Tehran.</p>

Ron Paul would like to repeal as much as he can of the reforms of the New Deal. <br>
         <br>
This is what President Eisenhower said about people like him: &#8220;Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas.5 Their number is negligible and they are stupid.&#8221;<br>

<p>In an ordinary political cycle, I would agree with you from a tactical standpoint.  But, Ron Paul will do far better in 2012 than he did in 2008 because the financial crisis has happened since then.  Yeah, Ron Paul might be against social welfare spending as a matter of principle, but even if he becomes President, social welfare spending will continue because no Congress would pass a budget without it.  Among people that will vote for Ron Paul and support social welfare spending, they&rsquo;re voting for him because they want permanent banking and monetary reform, and an end to futile and expensive foreign interventionism.

Ron Paul generates an enthusiasm other presidential candidates must envy. What he has always lacked is numbers. Of Republican candidates the only one who has ever been ahead of the President in any poll is Mitt Romney. <br>

A CNN/ORC International Poll out Tuesday indicates the president&rsquo;s margins have increased against five possible Republican presidential challengers in hypothetical general election matchups and that Obama&rsquo;s approval rating is up five points since mid-November.<br>
 <br>
According to the poll, Obama leads former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 52%-45% in a possible 2012 showdown. Romney, who&rsquo;s making his second bid for the GOP nomination, held a 51%-47% margin over the president in last month&rsquo;s survey. Obama also holds the same 52%-45% advantage over Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. Last month the president had a 51%-47% margin over Paul, who&rsquo;s making his third run for the White House.</p>

If things continue to improve in the economy and the international situation, the President could be headed for reelection by a comfortable margin in a victory that will include Democratic control of both houses of Congress. </p>

<p>John: </p>
<p>This is why I like Ron Paul so much John.  More Big Government or government interventions are NOT the answer.  In the first half of the last century, no one did more to promote government growth than FDR.</p>
<p>Longtime socialist leader Norman Thomas said FDR implemented more of his policies than he ever could. </p>
<p>Does not Obama also believe in more government and that government intervention is the best policy in every fact of your life? </p>
<p>This is what the New Deal and a belief in ever Bigger Government have wrought:</p>
<p><i>Today, one out of every seven Americans is on food stamps and one out of every four American children is on food stamps.</i></p>
<p><i>In 1980, government transfer payments accounted for just 11.7% of all income. Today, government transfer payments account for more than 18 percent of all income.</i></p>
<p><i>A staggering 48.5% of all Americans live in a household that receives some form of government benefits. Back in 1983, that number was below 30 percent.</i></p>
<p>These ARE staggering figures, create an entitlement mentality and are not sustainable.  Do you believe that Social Security is a viable well-run program, that there is a lock box somewhere that will cover all SS demands here and into the future?  Maybe the lock box is in Disneyland&rsquo;s Fantasyland somewhere.</p>
<p><i>According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 46 percent of all American workers have less than $10,000 saved for retirement, and 29 percent of all American workers have less than $1,000 saved for retirement.</i></p>
<p>What happens when the government runs out of other people&rsquo;s money to redistribute (to paraphrase Margaret Thatcher)?  When the EBT cards no longer work?  When SS is not longer sustainable? When the printing presses have printed out their last phony fiat dollar?  What next?  Tax the rich?  </p>

<p>Social grants encourage people not to work, and to have as many children as possible.For every child born,the parents receive a monthly grant until the child is 18 years old. </p>
