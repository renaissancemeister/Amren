			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, December 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the infiltration of the migrants into Israel is a &#8220;national calamity in all fields  &mdash;  the economy, state security,&#8221; Israel Radio reports.</p>
<p>Saying that Israel has no obligation to advance illegal immigration into its borders, he explained that &#8220;if we do not act to stop the flood, we&rsquo;ll be washed away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Netanyahu announced on Sunday that he will travel to Africa in an attempt to coordinate with state leaders the return of illegal African immigrants in Israel to their native countries.</p>
<p>Netanyahu&rsquo;s trip comes as his Cabinet approves a $160 million program designed to stanch the flow of illegal African migrants into Israel.</p>
<p>The plan calls for speeding up construction to complete within the coming year a border fence with Egypt. The fence is also meant to keep out Islamist militants.</p>
<p>The new program allows for a monetary fine for the employing of illegal immigrants and, in some cases, the closing of offending businesses.</p>

		<p>Before going on a tirade about the &#8220;jooz&#8221; the reader should consider that the vast majority of America&rsquo;s committed leftist Jewry is actually anti-Israel. Guys like Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky, or even Tim Wise somehow think that giving the Palestinians a nation will make the nightmare end. It&rsquo;s trendy for young liberal kids (gentile and Jew) to blather about Hamas and Hezbollah (and even the Taliban) being freedom fighters.</p>
<p>I understand that &#8220;politics makes strange bedfellows&#8221; but guys like David Duke who think they can reach across the aisle to Muslims are going to be in for a rude awakening in the future.</p>
<p>That being said, yes this is a hypocritical case of &#8220;do as we say, not as we do.&#8221; </p>

		<p>In 1900 Arabic speakers in all of Palestine, including the Trans-Jordan, were less than ten percent of a much smaller population.  It was only after American and European Jews started pouring large amount of money into the area that the Muslims showed any interestd in it.  Now they want it all for themselves.  </p>

<p>Israel started the flow of African migrants when they airlifted thousands of East Africans into Israel in the 1980&rsquo;s and &rsquo;90s.</p>
<p>Many East Africans claimed ancient ancestral connections to Judaism, and rabbinical scholars agreed.  The blacks worshipped in a vaguely Jewish way, and used the star of David as a spiritual symbol.</p>
<p>The Israelis &#8216;brought the lost tribe home&rsquo;.  Before then, an African in Israel stood out like a sore thumb; after the airlifts, blacks could walk the streets of Israel and nobody could tell if they were a citizen or not.</p>
<p>Once the other blacks left behind in Africa saw the higher standard of living their kin were enjoying in Israel, they wanted in.  </p>

<p>I wish Mr. Netanyahu good luck. If he finds a workable solution, I hope he will share his success with us and support our efforts to stop our &#8216;national calamity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In other news, Israeli National News has an interesting op-ed piece about the consequences of multiculturalism:</p>

<p>&#8220;Netanyahu announced on Sunday that he will travel to Africa in an attempt to coordinate with state leaders the return of illegal African immigrants in Israel to their native countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nuts.  Why waste the trip.  What&rsquo;s there to coordinate?  These leaders will say whatever it&rsquo;s convenient for them to say.  They hate Israel and they would be delighted to have Israel drown in trash.</p>
<p>Israel has airplanes and boats.  Use them.  Find out which country the immigrant in question is from, and physically repatriate the person.  Use a plane that is registered in some other country if necessary.  The plane could stop off in a friendly third country (like Egypt maybe?), and have that country perform the deportation and then ship them one-way.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t over-think situations like this.  All that matters is physically getting these migrants from someplace where they are not needed (Israel) back to their homes.</p>

<p>No leader of a White country could get away with stating these (truthful) comments.</p>
<p>If any major politician in the US, Europe, or Australia made these exact same comments, the controlled media would make it a raging controversy about White racism for months on end. </p>
<p>It is sickening that only White countries are racist for being against illegal third world immigration while a different standard applies to black, brown, yellow, and middle eastern countries.</p>

		<p>Read an article today that said they expect the world to produce an addl billion people every fifteen years, or less, 100% of whom will come from Africa and SE Asia (also known as backward and/or muslim countries) due to birth vs death rates. Those places that resist any form of birth control because of superstition or fear that we are trying to wipe them out, or because they think they can take over the world this way. It was speculated that there would have to be be massive immigration to western (read that as white) countries because of it. (Two billion in 1930 vs eight billion in 15 yrs)</p>

		<p> I noticed that the controlled media, although still strongly pro-Israel, have become much more critical of Bibi Netanyahu. Could his tough talk against African &#8220;infiltrators&#8221; have anything to do with this? Jews in Israel are in the same sinking ship with the whites of Europe and America. We either all start bailing together or we&rsquo;re heading for the bottom. </p>

<p>We seriously need to RUN with these comments, and acts, though. Unfortunately I already know the likely response will be something like: &#8220;the Jews are a people with a history, who have been persecuted. White Americans are not a people, America has always been &#8220;multicultural&#8221;, and White Americans have no history.&#8221;</p>

<p>I know this analogy may sound brutal but&hellip;. I see &#8220;third worlders&#8221; as an invasive species like the zebra mussels in the great lakes.  They kill off the indigenous species to the point of destroying the ecosystem making it impossible for other life forms to exist.   It&rsquo;s kinda like a cancer!  It grows and grows until it kills off the host.  And the cancer is oblivious to the damage it causes.  Once the host dies, so does the cancer because it no longer has anything to feed from.    </p>
<p>Brutal viewpoint I know, but I believe it is accurate.  This opinion has been formed over 50 years of living among them.  <br>

<p>I would be very, very alert and suspicious of any deals that Netanyahu tries to deviously cut with African leaders, and this article from back in June 2011 will help everyone understand why.</p>
<p>Note:  It would be a relatively simple sleight-of-hand for Bibi to arrange a deal with African leaders to take in these illegal African immigrants, whereby the African leaders could classify them as &#8216;refugees&rsquo; and &#8216;asylum seekers&rsquo; - and then use that classification to sneak them into these insane Catholic and Christian Church &#8216;resettlement&rsquo; programs, and before we know what hit us - they&rsquo;re being shipped into America, Australia, Canada and every other White European nation.  Below, we see the sort of treason that is helping to destroy Australia.  <br>

<p>Danny Danon: Send African migrants to Australia<br>
By LAHAV HARKOV<br>
06/30/2011 16:35</p>
<p>Likud MK and Australian MP discuss &#8220;humane solution&#8221; for thousands of &#8216;Muslim infiltrators&rsquo; in Israel: Send them to live down under.<br>
Talkbacks (12)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
MK Danny Danon (Likud) asked Australian MP Michael Danby on Wednesday to propose, in parliament in Canberra, sending African migrants from Israel to Australia.</p>
<p>Danon and Danby discussed the issue during the Australian politician&rsquo;s visit to Israel for the World Jewish Congress&rsquo;s International Conference of Jewish Parliamentarians.<br>

Recently, Israel even asked Australia to resettle african refugees in Australia.  Huh?  If they are such a &#8220;calamity&#8221; to Israel, what good would they be to Australia?</p>
<p>The double standard of the controlled media is absolutely disgusting.</p>
<p>Netanyahu makes these comments and the controlled media is completely silent across the board.</p>
<p>If a White leader in any US or European country made these exact comments, this same controlled media would have gone into convulsions about White racism.</p>
<p>Why is it that only White countries are expected to embrace and bankroll massive third world immigration?</p>

		<p>Although Africa is a terrible place to live, it&rsquo;s surprising that the refugees would see Israel as a safe haven. There always seems to be a lot of violence there from the conflict with the Palestinians, and unfortunately, it looks as though there will soon be a war with Iran. It&rsquo;s a shame, because it would otherwise be an interesting place to visit, as so much Bible history took place there.</p>

		<p>Traveling to those countries the &#8220;refugees&#8221; come from could be beneficial. The greatest portion of them come from Eritrea, and claim they can not return because they would be considered deserters and punished.<br>
If Netanyahu could make a deal with the president/king/whatever he calls himself of Eritrea (and other countries) to &#8220;pardon&#8221; those immigrants in exchange for some million dollars in &#8220;humanitarian support&#8221; (or payed directly to the presidents Swiss bank account. In any case the money will end up there) it would be great. The Eritreans would be forcefully repatriated for a relatively low price. The president/king might be tempted to repeat this game but hopefully by then a wall on the border of Egypt would be completed.<br>
For those complaining that your leaders could not say similar things, I agree that this is wrong and truly hope things change for the best in your countries. Just do not blame all the &#8220;joos&#8221; for this, I would not complain if you somehow deported your own illegal immigrants, nor would Netanyahu.</p>

<p>One other ugly fact is that Henry Ford had Thompson submachine guns used on striking workers.  My grandfather was his doctor for many years and a social contact.  Henry Ford was a capitalist of the extreme, old school type.  But we are forced to also recognize that in the 20s and especially in the 30s, after the Great Depression began, the communist movement was active and agitating workers.  And all the West had to do was look at the USSR with Stalin murdering millions of Russians in the name of communism at the same time.  Radical times create radical actions.  </p>
<p>Later during WW2, the NAACP sued repeatedly for integration in the arms production industries.  The result was riots all over the country, but the riots in Detroit were among the worst and I think a culture for destructive rioting was established then.</p>

		<p>I think we should avoid entanglement in Palestine/Israel and Islam/Zionism issues, and their distracting complication by half-educated and bigoted generalisers of different kinds. The &#8220;Jewish&#8221; or &#8220;Antisemitism&#8221; question is a well-known briar-patch trap for white nationalists.</p>
<p>Leave Jews to decide, for themselves, on which side their matzo is today buttered in face of the growing migrational clash between white western civilization and &#8220;third world&#8221; populations; Jewish traditional hostility to white/&#8221;Aryan&#8221;/ Christian nationalism in the past, however more deeply ingrained after the Hitler experience, is undergoing a sea-change as we both face the demographic abyss. It is sensible to take on board what writers as varied as MacDonald, Finkelstein and Faurisson have had to say, but also the writings of no less serious scholars of quite different viewpoints.</p>
<p>There are rights and wrongs on both sides of the Mid-East conflict, which I don&rsquo;t think is the primary concern of AmRen. We need simply to draw the lesson from current controversy that birds of ANY feather prefer to flock together - and resent cuckoos.</p>

And we&rsquo;re talking about Africans here  &mdash;  Outside of lamestream conservatives, the Republican Party and white football fans, who really likes blacks? Not even other blacks.&#8221; </p>
<p>I do, I&rsquo;ve met many upstanding black people and really, immigration? Do you know how many millions of blacks have been here since the the 16 and 1700&rsquo;s? Some blacks have genetics that have been in the U.S longer than my family has and many other white families that arrived during WW1/WW2. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I have a problem with Hispanics per say, but the illegals from Mexico present all sorts of societal issues&hellip; disease is one. Remember they aren&rsquo;t given the same set of vaccines as we are&hellip; the diseases we stamped out in the U.S are coming back because the ILLEGALS (It&rsquo;s called illegal for a reason), just waltz in. No health checks, no background checks, nothing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even adopt a dog without a vaccination/health check!<br>

		<p><i>Jewish traditional hostility to white/Aryan/ Christian nationalism in the past, however more deeply ingrained after the Hitler experience, is undergoing a sea-change as we both face the demographic abyss.</i></p>
<p>Could you provide examples this sea change, because, frankly, I haven&rsquo;t seen any sort of change in their traditional hostility.</p>
<p><i>There are rights and wrongs on both sides of the Mid-East conflict, which I don&rsquo;t think is the primary concern of AmRen.</i> </p>
<p>White Americans have NO business involved in the affairs of any Mid-East conflict.  None.  No white American should &#8220;fight&#8221; in these &#8220;wars&#8221; no matter what lies the American government and media tell us.</p>

<p>What does that matter how long they&rsquo;ve been here?  They&rsquo;ve been a scourge on every white population on the planet.  This civilization was not created by or for blacks.  Their exorbitant crime rate alone make them a massive plague on the white population.  I&rsquo;m sure Eve Carson&rsquo;s loved ones would agree.</p>

<p>Illegal &#8220;immigration&#8221; and the undocumented are invaders, period. I will go further and say the 1965 Immigration Act was another deliberate foreign invasion act!

<p>Call it what it is. A deliberate nonwhite invasion. We have been invaded for decades now thanks to the enemy within our nation. They are an army of invaders and thieves and we do nothing.</p>

		<p>Brief answer please to 30 (& 31 probably alluding to the role of some Jewish traders in transatlantic slavery) without joining them in that enormously adhesive &#8220;briar patch&#8221;:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect Jews to fund the Occidental Observer, enjoy downloading David Duke or David Icke, let alone conceal their swastika tattoos under white hoods, or that any of them will turn overnight into a Dan Burros (remember him?).  <br>
Seriously, their repositioning towards white Gentiles is not disinterested; it arises from the desire to protect Israelis from an Islamism they compare (with some justification) to Nazism. Nevertheless, it is welcome if Jews support the defence of our common civilisation against Muslim and other invasions.<br>
Not yet a sea change like the switch from communism to neo-conservatism, but straws against the gales well described by Mark Steyn in &#8220;After America&#8221; (2011).</p>
<p>Read Michael Levin, &#8220;Why Race Matters&#8221; (1997); Pascal Bruckner, &#8220;The Tyranny of Guilt&#8221; (2010); Byron M. Roth, &#8220;The Perils of Diversity: Immigration and Human Nature&#8221; (2010); Melanie Phillips, e.g. &#8220;The real crisis that explains the chaos at our border controls,&#8221; Daily Mail (London), November 7, 2011. Enough Jewish examples, Dog Star?</p>

<p>Total nonsnense.  No such thing is happening.  </p>

<p>You just contradicted yourself here.  More importantly, neo-conservatism is an example of why we should not allow Jews who are primarily motivated by Jewish/Israeli concerns to come anywhere near our movement:  they will hijack it and turn it against us, just like they did with conservatism.  <br>

<p>Brief answer back to you. I repeat.</p>
<p>Illegal &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; and the undocumented are invaders, period. I will go further and say the 1965 Immigration Act was another deliberate foreign invasion act! I will even go further than that and say bringing the African slaves here was another of the deliberate nonwhite invasion treason heaped on us by our enemy and their stooges.</p>

		<p>Well aware of the hi-jack aspect across a very wide spectrum of &#8220;conservative&#8221; groups and publications, and the sycophancy of liberal book and movie reviewers.<br>
I suggest instead a parallel Gentile plus Jew strategy - against foreign immigration into the white nations. <br>
I always opposed &#8220;our&#8221; foreign intervention in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan,&c.;<br>
You need adequately to understand the psychology of Jews, and to respond with accurate knowledge of their past and strategic finesse towards the future. <br>
Consult the writers cited.<br>
This is my final submission on this subject.</p>
