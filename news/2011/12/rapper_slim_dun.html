<h1>Rapper Slim Dunkin Slain in Atlanta Music Studio</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, December 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Atlanta police say the rapper Slim Dunkin was gunned down Friday evening in a music studio as he was preparing to record a video.</p>
<p>Police Maj. Keith Meadows said the rapper, whose real name is Mario Hamilton, was fatally shot in the chest after getting into an argument with another individual.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meadows told The Associated Press late Friday that police have not been able to identify the shooter. He said investigators have been interviewing those who were inside the studio. He said as many as 20 people were inside the small office-type building at the time of the shooting, which took place around 5:30 p.m. local time, but they were in different places.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Slim Dunkin had appeared on a number of songs with the rapper Waka Flocka Flame. The website Mtv.com reported that the Brick Squad Monopoly rapper was on a solo track and had recently released a 20-track mix tape that featured Gucci Mane, Roscoe Dash and Pastor Troy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears the victim was scheduled to do a photo shoot,&#8221; Meadows said of Friday&rsquo;s events. &#8220;Before the video shoot took place, it appears the victim and suspect got involved in a verbal altercation. We don&rsquo;t know what that altercation was about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The suspect produced a weapon, discharged that handgun one time, striking the victim in the chest,&#8221; Meadows said.</p>
<p>Meadows said the victim was in his early 20s and resided in the Atlanta area.</p>

		<p>Mr. Dunkin was part of &#8220;The Brick Squad.&#8221; A &#8220;brick&#8221; is a slang term for a kilo of cocaine or heroin. Stopping short of speaking ill of the dead, let me exercise a little decorum and just say that we did not lose the next Louis Pasteur, and this news pains me about as much as the passing of the late Kim Jong Il.</p>

		<p>Fatal &#8220;disputes&#8221; such as these occur far more often among blacks than among other racial groups due to the former&rsquo;s incapacity for peaceful conflict resolution.  Recall that Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace (&#8220;Notorious B.I.G.&#8221;) were murdered by other blacks some 15 years ago over hip-hop business &#8220;disputes,&#8221; and that rapper Sean Combs, aka P. Diddy, was arrested for shooting off a gun outside a Manhattan nightclub in December 1999.  Say this for them:  They practice what they write and sing about.  </p>

		<p>Another dog bites man story.  Ho hum.  We need to be compassionate and understanding.  WIth their extremely limited vocabulary, and retard level IQ, a gun is often what&rsquo;s turned to in order to end the argument.  At least for blacks.<br>

		<p>Rap either makes people violent, or attracts people who would commit crimes more than other forms of &#8220;music&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those are the only 2 sane conclusions one can make about rap music.</p>
<p>To say as the liberals do that rap doesn&rsquo;t make one violent is blind ignorance at best.</p>

		<p>A few days ago I read the full article about this.  Since I am originally from Atlanta and am otherwise proud of the music industry there, these sort of killings will always embarrass and then frustrate me.  However, what I want to know is how TWENTY people can be in the studio yet no one knows who did the shooting.  Really?  Do &#8220;they&#8221; stick together to that degree?  </p>
<p>If ANYONE shot my friend or colleague and I saw it or thought I knew who did it I&rsquo;d be at the police station daily trying to assist them. The killing is bad enough.  The cover-up is incomprehensible. </p>

		<p>I know of no other genre of music, in which the people involved in it are murdered so much, or become involved in violent crime. Then again, I listen to rock and pop, with mostly white musicians. If you have a genre of music that involves large numbers of black people, then it&rsquo;s no surprised that typical black behaviour will manifest itself. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m an Indian American raised in India for most of my early life, I can attest to the fact that the vast majority of Indians who happen to listen to western ( international) music there, love Classic Hard rock/ Country and in some cases even classical - actually a microscopic percentile of Indians listen to western music ( 
<p>I remember growing up and being one of the 0.3% of Indians who actually became a western music buff&hellip;..we had our own small crowd ( westernised Indians)..and all we listened to was the classic British hard rock bands - Led Zepplin, Queen ( the lead singer Freddie Mercury was an Indian Briton btw), Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and Def Leppard. Among the American bands, the most popular being Metallica, Bon Jovi, Gun&rsquo;s N Roses, Pearl Jam, Nirvana &amp; Van Halen. A lot of Indians who listen to western music LOVE classic country: Alabama, John Denver &amp; Randy Travis being the most popular. Heres is an Indian who has become popular around the world as one of the few token &#8220;redneck&#8221; country artists from India also called the &#8220;Curry Cowboy&#8221;. He does world tours &amp; is well received in the American &amp; Australian country music fairs. Oh &amp; almost ALL Indians HATE rap/ Hip hop!</p>

<p>Randy, <br>
You&rsquo;re so wrong. There was a terrible incident in Philadelphia recently when a group of Opera fans were exiting the Academy of Music following a performance of Puccini&rsquo;s Turandot and got into an argument with another group who were declaring that Giuseppe Verdi was a better composer than Puccini. Things got out of hand and fisticuffs broke out and suddenly both groups, all White,  ran down Locust street breaking store windows and randomly assaulting passersby. One of the assault victims, De Shawn Kaadir Shabazz Watkins reported that his $300 Nikes, his $3,000 Breitling Watch and his $600. Sig Sauer .45 ACP pistol had been stolen. <br>
Store owners reported large losses during the melee as Opera fans wantonly smashed their show windows and grabbed whatever they could.<br>
Mayor Michael Nutter announced that the City would revisit the issue of whether to ban Operatic performances in the future since &#8220;These people obviously are incapable of conducting themselves in a civilized manner.&#8221; The Mayor also announced that the ban might extend to Ballet Performances as well following an incident two months before after a performance of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Swan Lake. Where assaults and looting also occurred. <br>
The mayor added that &#8221; We will NOT tolerate a climate where citizens like Mr. Watkins cannot enjoy a pleasant evening stroll without being assaulted by groups of thuggish opera fans&#8221;. Watkins thanked the Mayor and stated that his watch and sneakers were only accessories but his Sig Sauer was &#8221; How ah oin mah livin&rsquo;. Know wham sain?&#8221;<br>

20 people there and nobody saw nuffin&rsquo;! Nothing will change unless you have witnesses help the po-po.</p>
<p>I have had a couple friends in the past who worked for music labels, both of them have had cRap &#8220;stars&#8221; point guns at them. Both times it was about money and their belief they were ripped off by the label. They have the mentality of a spoiled child, who has been coddled their whole life.</p>
<p>High testosterone levels + childs brain + poor impulse control + access to guns = gangsta&rsquo; cRap star. </p>

<p>Child&rsquo;s Brain???? Your are insulting children. Even Children can compose much better music than retarded (C)rap stars! As a child, by the age of 7, I was able to play the piano, sitar and conjure of tunes far better than a crummy computer generated beat mixed with basslines &amp; background sound stolen from somewhere else mixed with retarded rhyming &amp; jungle sounds which is finally labelled as what is popularly called (C)rap!</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t even really a black thing.  We don&rsquo;t hear about rhythm &amp; blues singers, jazz bands or minstrel groups gunning each other down.  This sort of cultural toxicity in the black segment of the music industry seems to be confined solely to rap.</p>
