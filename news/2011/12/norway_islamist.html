<h1><a href="http://www.thelocal.no/page/view/norway-islamist-calls-for-new-us-terror-attacks">Norway Islamist Calls for New US Terror Attacks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local, December 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Norway&rsquo;s Progress Party has called for the immediate arrest of Mullah Krekar after the firebrand jihadist spoke of the need for renewed terrorist attacks on the United States.</p>
<p>The Norway-based extremist made the comments in an interview with Finland&rsquo;s MTV3. He also claimed that Islam &#8220;will control the entire world&#8221; within the next 20 years.</p>
<p>More than a decade on from the devastating terrorist attacks in the United States that left almost 3,000 people dead, Krekar said:</p>
<p>&#8220;They have learned nothing from the 9/11 attacks. That&rsquo;s why they need two more attacks. It&rsquo;s the only way the Americans will understand that we [Muslims] are people and not animals or slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morten Ørsal Johansen, immigration policy spokesman for the populist Progress Party, said the remarks merited placing Krekar under arrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have just passed a new law stating that anybody who poses a threat to basic national interests may be subject to arrest. There&rsquo;s no doubt that Krekar should now be apprehended,&#8221; he told newspaper VG.</p>
<p>Krekar, the co-founder of Islamist militant group Ansar al-Islam, moved to Norway as a refugee from northern Iraq in 1991.</p>
<p>In the Finnish TV interview, he also spoke cryptically of how European-style democracy would never take root in the Middle East. Likening the export of Western democracy to a &#8220;plastic banana&#8221;, he said it would never work in the Arab world because, unlike the real thing, &#8220;you can&rsquo;t eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also argued in the three-minute interview that further terrorist attacks were unavoidable, VG reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s going to happen. It&rsquo;s meant to happen. Jihad is meant to happen, I&rsquo;m certain of it. Jihad is like a cat. If you lock up a cat it becomes dangerous,&#8221; said Krekar.</p>
<p>The radical Islamist is set to appear in court in Norway in February after allegedly issuing verbal death threats to five different people, including Conservative Party (Høyre) leader Erna Solberg.<br>

		<p>The funny thing about those European Islamists is that they consider Anders Breivik, the anti-Muslim killer as a role model.</p>
<p>Seems like terror and violence is attractive to Muslims as such.</p>

		<p>In a sane world, this man would be tending goats and living in a dirt house in northern Iraq.  Instead he&rsquo;s able to live in luxury at the Norwegian people&rsquo;s expense and call for his hosts&rsquo; and Western Civilization&rsquo;s subjugation at the hands of a 7th century, backwards cult.</p>

<p>Will our State Department show gratitude for this?  Probably not.  What will happen is that if the Progress Party gains power, the State Department will throw a fit.  The CIA will probably do a bit of assassinating on the side.</p>
<p><i>Krekar, the co-founder of Islamist militant group Ansar al-Islam, moved to Norway as a refugee from northern Iraq in 1991.</i></p>
<p>What was going on in Iraq in 1991?  Oh yeah.  Invade the world, invite the world.</p>

<p>A broken clock is right twice a day.  The real reason it will never work is because the dominant peoples of the Middle East don&rsquo;t possess the requisite sociology to sustain real democratic republicanism.</p>

		<p>The Norway-based extremist made the comments in an interview with Finland&rsquo;s MTV3. He also claimed that Islam &ldquo;will control the entire world&rdquo; within the next 20 years.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that Islam IS already on the way to controling the world and as this extremist has pointed out we have not learnt from 9/11.</p>
<p>A few days ago the 70th anniversary of Pearl Harbour was remembered. As I understand matters there were less casualties at Pearl Harbour than in the 9/11 attack. Pearl Harbour was dealt with decisively, and very decisivly, all in the overall context of WW2.</p>
<p>But what have we done following 9/11? First of all we have become involved in a pointless, costly and basically unwinable war in Afghanistan, a war that continues without direction even though the person behind 9/11 has long been captured and killed.</p>
<p>Then even more devastatiing, the whole western world has gone out of it&rsquo;s way to appease Islam. We have laws in place (&#8220;hate&#8221; crimes) which prevent anyone speaking out against Islam. At this time of the year we have municipal authorities dismantling Nativity Scenes so as not to offend Muslims. We have home-grown terrorists, ie. Muslims with Australian or US citizenship quite happy to destroy their host counties which have given them everything. We have &#8220;Islamic Studies&#8221; forced on to our children at school. We have draconian anti-discrimination laws in place to protect Muslims and the do-gooders now want us to adopt Sharia Law. We have almost open-door immigration policies for bogus refugees from Muslim countries. The list could go on and on.</p>
<p>If we want to travel we now need to undergo rigourous security checks just in case some Muslim wants to blow up the aeroplane we are travelling on. We also totally rely on Muslim oil to power that same aeroplane.</p>
<p>Yes, the West is already controlled by and is bowing down to Islam.</p>
<p>Some 30 years ago I was involved with some missionaries who had recently returned from Malaysia, I still remember what they had to say, words to this effect: The West should stop worrying about the Soviet Union, it is the rise of Islam that will destroy us.</p>

		<p>This man is an obvious idiot who will embarrass most Muslims. Islam has adopted a policy of gradualism not extremism. They know that far higher birthrates, mass immigration &amp; liberal useful fools will give them control of Europe within 20 years. Terror &amp; jihad just rock the boat &amp; stir up resistance. Muslims in the west are increasingly sophisticated &amp; are playing a winning game. The whites corrupted by cultural Marxism are sitting ducks.</p>

<p>Well, he&rsquo;s certainly right about that. Most of the Middle East is a bottomless sinkhole, which will never be westernized.  If only our foolish smiley faced politicians would understand this. They are different from us. We should get out of there immediately and seal the place off.  The main reason the west is under constant threat from Muslim terrorists, is because we have let so many of them settle here in the first place. If we had kept them out, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation.     </p>
<p>Krekar arrived in Norway in 1991 as a Kurdish refuge. What Norway needed with a militant Muslim mullah is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but he has spent the last two decades preaching hatred towards the very same people that gave him refuge in their peaceful prosperous nation. Norwegians have allowed him to do this with impunity. He should never have been allowed in, and should be kicked out at once. Unfortunately, the human rights of foreigners are much more important to many Scandinavians, than are their own people.<br>

<p>Still twenty years? Young Pakistani men have been saying twenty years to me with big smiles on their faces for at least 15 years now. I guess math is not their strong point.</p>
<p>I am so glad I now longer live and work in the midlands of England.</p>
<p>There was a tv documentary some years ago that showed these Muslim men repeating the same mantra 20 years ! 20 Years! They still can&rsquo;t manage it even with all the cultural Marxists aiding them.</p>

		<p>Poster 3-you are right on the money with that. Krekar is basically stating something that we as civilized White race recognizers all know. Democracy can&rsquo;t work in the Middle East because low IQ Arabs and Africans are not mentally strong enough or smart enough to think ahead. I give him this much. He knows what he doesn&rsquo;t know. Now if we could only trick him into thinking he&rsquo;s really back in a sandy slum called Iraq. Import thousands of pounds of sand, a few industrial size heaters, some fake sun like on a Hollywood set, and voila&hellip; It&rsquo;ll be just like home. And he would want to go back to the &#8220;sun people,&#8221; &amp; leave us &#8220;ice people&#8221; to be.</p>

<p>Arabs must have been most probably white in the past. Mixtures with slaves pulled their IQ down? Owning black slaves have always been a tradition among Arabs what Jews hadn&rsquo;t done it. They originate from the very same region so they couldn&rsquo;t have been too distinct.  So strict endogamy kept Jews purer than their Muslim counterparts. It&rsquo;s also apply to Christian Arabs who are on average lighter than Muslims (f.e. Copts in Egypt are &#8220;whiter&#8221;, Lebanese look like Southern Europeans).</p>
<p>Or oil export makes them lazy and unintelligent? Any other suggestions?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Islam built a great civilization at some time in the history. That&rsquo;s a fact we can&rsquo;t deny. However, I&rsquo;m still not sure what caused their decline.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Golden Age&#8221; of Islam happened at a point in time where Muslims were conquering large parts of the globe and ruling a lot of people. The &#8220;great civilization&#8221; did not come of Islam.</p>
<p>Many of the great Muslim scientists and discoverers from that time were Persians and a lot of &#8220;Muslim discoveries&#8221; came by way of something non-Muslim (i.e. our &#8220;Arabic&#8221; numerals are actually Hindu). The Muslims also absorbed the Coptic and Byzantine civilizations to a large degree, except for those that fled to Europe.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Golden Age&#8221; of Islam ended because Muslims ran out of cultures they could absorb. Islam is a retrograde force and stagnates or pulls down more advanced cultures. This is why they are so behind us, and have been.</p>
<p>Just because you have better technology doesn&rsquo;t mean you can win though. You also need the will to use it. Our society is led by cowards both on race and religion, and this is why Islam has seen the gains against us that it has.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with Mullah Krekar on one thing only - that &#8220;democracy&#8221; will not work in the Islamic world. And yet, Joe Biden runs around the Middle East, saying they should adopt &#8220;democracy&#8221;. He doesn&rsquo;t understand that Muslims would rather live in a theocratic state, like Iran; where there is no separation of mosque and state.</p>
<p>The United States has learned absolutely NOTHING since World War I, when Woodrow Wilson dragged the U.S. into the war to &#8220;make the world safe for democracy&#8221; He also lamented why all the world&rsquo;s peoples didn&rsquo;t follow the &#8220;teachings of Jesus Christ.&#8221; He was, of course, one of those Ivy League ivory tower-dwelling professors, before he entered politics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet many Norweigians are secretly agreeing with Anders Breivik, even if they didn&rsquo;t approve of his methods. He said that this would happen. The mullah has now confirmed it. </p>

___</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t come from Christianity, either. The ancient Greek civilization and the mighty Roman Empire weren&rsquo;t Christians at all. And being Persian doesn&rsquo;t mean you are not a Muslim. They are separate things. Don&rsquo;t mix up religion with ethnicity. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This is why they are so behind us, and have been.<br>
____</p>
<p>This is incorrect. Middle age Europe was far behind of Islamic world, on par, perhaps even behind stone age with absolute dominance of Christianity and could be regarded as one of the darkest eras of the history. Or you claim the Berserker Vikings who are famous for their torture styles built the great Bagdad and Madrid libraries?</p>
<p>Once Islam stopped absorbing other cultures, Christianity started to absorb other cultures like in Central <br>
and South America. Today, America is absorbing world cultures by Hollywood, many &#8220;Muslims wear the same clothes, listen to same music, watch same movies and drink the same cola, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Another example would be Asiatics, once stopped attacking Europe, European Russians started expanding eastwards.</p>
<p>It has very little to do with religion in my opinion.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s simply no way these primitives are going to inflict their control on the rest of the world, not now, not twenty years from now, not ever.</p>

		<p>You have to give credit where it is due to cultural achievements past and present. While opposing generalisations, I would suggest that societies and cultures depend primarily on their elites, and on their capacity for art, science and administration, though cultures will differ from one another for genetic and geographical reasons.  The beauty of the Taj Mahal is somewhat tainted in Christian eyes by the fate of the workmen.<br>
The decline of Arab and other Muslim societies had various causes: (1) the physical elimination of elites by e.g. Mongol invasion; (2) dysgenic birth-rates; and possibly (3) the impact of hashish. <br>
What matters most in practical terms is our present and future as a western civilization, and the correct LESSONS to be drawn from an exact, unprejufdiced investigation of the fall of nations, cultures and civilizations in the past.  The case for banning low-IQ immigration and an internal positive eugenics policy seems pretty strong, unless we are irreversibly gripped by a &#8220;Spenglerian&#8221; inability to escape doom.</p>

		<p>#8 Democracy doesn&rsquo;t work in average IQ nations either. Just look at how much social and economic damage short shighted policies have done to Europe and North America over a couple of generations. </p>
<p>Another fundamental problem with democracy is that it turns the nation into a kind of commons that gets raped by just about all kinds of special interests. The voting citizenry doesn&rsquo;t care or understand until they have been robbed dry, and its too late by then. </p>
<p>Americans are slowly beginning to understand the precarious situation they are in judging by Ron Paul&rsquo;s surge in the Republican primaries, but the wealth that has been stolen is already gone and the social damage is already done and Ron Paul cant do anything about that. </p>
<p>Judging by history, democracy is an aberration that is gone after a handful of generations. Autocracies, despite all their shortcomings, are considerably more durable. I dont think democracy will be found anywhere in Europe after the big upcoming pan-European civil wars. Its going to be various forms of dictatorships, ranging from Islamic theocracies in lost areas, liberal-Marxist PC dictatorships (basically social pressure cookers) in areas that yet have fallen into disarray and National Socialist dictatorships in areas where the local whites have won. The Islamists and National Socialists will consume the liberal-Marxist dictatorships from the inside until they crumble. </p>
