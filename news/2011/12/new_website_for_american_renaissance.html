			<h1>
				New Website for American Renaissance
			</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to <a href="https://www.amren.com/">our new website</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have improved the look of the AmRen site and added new sections to give it depth &mdash; and we have tried to make these changes easy to understand for regular readers of the old site.
			</p>
			<p>
				As before, the &ldquo;News&rdquo; is on the home page, but we have added two new sections: &ldquo;Opinion,&rdquo; which is composed of short, topical pieces and &ldquo;Features,&rdquo; which are longer articles. The slide show at the top of the home page refers to the latest &ldquo;Features.&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				We have a new comments system that should allow people who register through a social network such as Facebook to post comments that appear immediately. Those who prefer to comment anonymously are welcome to do so, but their comments will be moderated. We learn a great deal from reader comments, and hope you will continue to enrich our site with your insights.
			</p>
			<p>
				A website makeover as radical as this is a major undertaking, and there are sure to be surprises. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience, and hope you will let us know if you find problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				But most of all we hope that you will find the new AmRen.com a vast improvement over the old, and that you will make our site your base for race-realist news and commentary.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jared Taylor and Henry Wolff
