<h1>Senator Calling for Boycott After Lowe&rsquo;s Pulls Ad from Muslim Reality Show</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KTLA News (Los Angeles), December 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A California senator is threatening a boycott against homebuilding supply chain Lowe&rsquo;s after it pulled advertising from the reality TV show &#8220;All-American Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite what many call a &#8220;positive portrayal&#8221; of Muslim life, the show has come under protest recently, prompting Lowe&rsquo;s to cut its ads after the Florida Family Association called on members to email the program&rsquo;s advertisers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lowe&rsquo;s has received a significant amount of communication on this program, from every perspective possible. Individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic, and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views. As a result we did pull our advertising on this program,&#8221; the company said in a statement Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it is best to respectfully defer to communities, individuals and groups to discuss and consider such issues of importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Bay state Senator Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) sent a letter to the company&rsquo;s CEO Saturday saying the company&rsquo;s move is un-American and undermines efforts by the Muslim community to improve public understanding of one of the world&rsquo;s largest growing religious communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The conservative Florida Family Association cheered Lowe&rsquo;s decision. The group called the TLC show &#8220;propaganda that riskily hides the Islamic agenda&rsquo;s clear and present danger to American liberties and traditional values.&#8221;</p>

<p>If one wants to &#8220;improve their understanding&#8221; of Islam, they need only read the Koran. Of course, the more I understand about Islam, the more Islamophobic I find myself becoming.</p>

		<p>Thank you, Lowe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I will now go out of my way to patronize your stores even though Home Depot is much closer. The public is going to have to do more boycotting of businesses that want to kiss up to propaganda (excuse me, perception managment) nonsense like American Muslims.<br>

		<p>Unless I&rsquo;m missing something, I think emailing Lowe&rsquo;s to support their decision is called for. BTW, as an old military vet, Lowes<br>
still gives me and other vets a 10% discount when we show them our military ID. You do not have to be retired from the military or active duty. Just having served gives you the discount. This is pretty classy.</p>

		<p>Is there a law saying once a company has purchased advertising on some show that it must do so forevermore? I&rsquo;ve looked at the show and consider it to be a reality-style propaganda program. I also think it&rsquo;s boring and unlikely to get much traction amongst the viewing audience out there. A weekly show featuring the ongoing worldwide persecution of Christians by Muslims would probably be much more interesting to watch. Something like that would be worth sponsoring. <br>

		<p>TLC&rsquo;s &ldquo;All-American Muslim&rdquo; is propaganda that riskily hides the Islamic agenda. 65 companies pull off the show. Please send your email to recent advertisers. </p>
<p>Florida Family Association has not experienced this strong of a response on any other issue during the past 23 years.  </p>

		<p>I watched the first episode of this program.  When I saw the Catholic boy just rolling over and converting to Islam, rather than asking his girlfriend to consider becoming Catholic, I realized what a ridiculous series this was.  It just presumes that Islam is superior to any other religion and Islamic society superior to Christian American society.  </p>

		<p>Boycotting Lowe&rsquo;s?  At first, I thought someone was boycotting Lowe&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s nothing more than another Mexican Big Box Mart a la Wal-Martinez or Homespanic Depot.  But no, it wasn&rsquo;t that.  When Lowe&rsquo;s gets something right, (a broken clock is right twice a day), that&rsquo;s what they want to rap their knuckles over.</p>

		<p>There are over one billion Muslims in the world.  American liberals say &#8220;only&#8221; 10% are militant and involved in wanting to kill anyone who isn&rsquo;t a Muslim.  That makes over 100 million Muslims in the world who want to kill us. Whew! That&rsquo;s a relief! Now on with the show!</p>

		<p>&#8221;  .  .  .  efforts by the Muslim community to improve public understanding of one of the world&rsquo;s largest growing religious communities.&#8221;  The real problem for the purveyors of this show is that there is much correct &#8220;understanding&#8221; of i-slam. muslims will be compliant citizens until they reach a tipping point of population,  usually around 10-15%,  at which time they will become demanding, threatening, violent and call for the overthrow of everything American.  Just as they have done in every other Westernized country they have been let into.</p>

		<p>Boycott?! I&rsquo;d say Lowe&rsquo;s deserves a &#8220;buycott&#8221; for this one. Although I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m thrilled about their bi-lingual signs in stores. But this idiotic show is such blatant propaganda that even multiculti Lowe&rsquo;s is staying clear of it.</p>

		<p>Looks like the muslims will have to purchase their nails, pipes, wire, fertilizer, etc. for their bombs from somewhere else, most likely Home Despot.</p>
<p><i>Lieu says Lowe&rsquo;s action is &#8216;non-sensical&rsquo;,  &#8216;poses a danger to American liberties&rsquo; and values &#8220;naked religious bigotry.&rsquo; He told The Associated Press on Sunday that he would also consider legislative action if Lowe&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t apologize to Muslims and reinstate its ads.</i></p>
<p>What kind of legislative action might that be senator? Do you plan to FORCE Lowe&rsquo;s, a private business, to advertise on a TV show?  What gives you the right to tell Lowe&rsquo;s how to run its business? It is because of types like you that businesses are fleeing the beholden state.</p>
<p>Lieu is nothing but a tin pot dictator.  The man should be FORCED out of office and a suit of tar and feathers wouldn&rsquo;t be inappropriate either. It&rsquo;s time they learned their power has limits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this:</p>
<p><i>Russell Simmons has called for a boycott of Lowe&rsquo;s on Twitter, with Simmons promising to &#8216;sic every civil rights agency on (Lowe&rsquo;s) until they straighten this out.&rsquo; He is also urging his Twitter followers to sign a petition   &mdash;   which, as of 3:25 ET Monday, had 9,660 of the 10,000 signatures the creators of the petition are hoping for   &mdash;   to urge other companies to advertise during &#8216;All-American Muslim.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>FOOL!!</p>
<p>Let Lowe&rsquo;s know that you support their decision by sending an email to:</p>

		<p>I commend Lowe&rsquo;s on their decision. I&rsquo;ve always preferred their stores to Home Depot, but now all my business will go exclusively to Lowe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Senator Ted Lieu is one of those politically correct progressives<br>
who will not be happy until everything we have ever stood for is destroyed. HE is the one who is un-American and is undermining this country, not Lowe&rsquo;s. I do not consider Islam a religion, but a violent cult. Their doctrines call us infidels and calls for our conversion, and if we cannot be converted, then calls for them to murder us. I know of no other religions whose doctrines call for this. </p>
<p>In the lands of their origin they treat women horribly. In the U.S. they can&rsquo;t get away with honor killings, stoning and the other atrocities that they practice overseas. But they are trying. They do not want to assimilate into the countries of western culture they move to, they want to take them over by trying to get Shariah law passed. They&rsquo;re chipping away at our Constitutional rights (google Shariah law, Dearborn, MI.)</p>
<p>The show All-American Muslim is a slap in all our faces. Islam spun to look gentle and innocent. Just more of our lying media&rsquo;s propaganda to lull the sheeple into a false sense of security so when the time is right we all just give up our freedoms without a whimper.</p>

<p>&#8220;All-American Muslim,&#8221; a new program on The Learning Channel that is being touted as a &#8220;powerful series&#8221; that carries viewers &#8220;inside the rarely seen world of American Muslims,&#8221; is being dropped by advertisers. </p>
<p>Critics say the program is nothing more than video jihad propaganda, and the Florida Family Association says it is contacting companies whose advertising appears on the show to ask them to quit. So far, 18 of 20 companies contacted have done so, the group said. </p>

Christians are in imminent danger across the world, and yet they are being refused refugee status, while Muslim refugee immigration goes on unimpeded. </p>
<p>U.S. policy regarding refugee resettlement would shock most Americans if they only knew. The United Nations picks who gets to come to the U.S. as a refugee. The mandate of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is to determine which of the world&rsquo;s huddled masses comes to the U.S. as humanitarian refugees. And predictably, this U.N. body is favoring Muslims. Christians from Muslim lands are being refused refugee status. </p>
<p>This is occurring despite the fact that in their home countries, under the Shariah, Christians face persecution and many times certain death for their religious beliefs. At the same time, whole Muslim communities are entering the U.S. by the tens of thousands per month, despite the fact that in their home countries they face no religious persecution. </p>
<p>This is no accident. We know that the U.N. is driven largely by its largest bloc of countries, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The OIC is one of the largest intergovernmental organizations in the world. It is a religious and political organization with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization dedicated in its own words to &#8220;eliminating and destroying Western civilization from within.&#8221; </p>
<p>It is horrifying but true that Afghan Christians are being refused refugee status by the U.N. and many Western nations, including Great Britain. The U.N. claims that Afghan Christians do not meet the criteria for refugee status that is stipulated in Statute 6B of the UNHCR, which requires refugees to have &#8220;a well founded fear of persecution by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion.&#8221;&hellip;.search for Pamela Gellers articles at WND to read the rest of this article.Just type Pamela Geller in WND search engine..Everyone should be sending her a BIG THANK YOU!! <br>

		<p>This stomach churning passage is from Sen. Lieu&rsquo;s letter to the CEO of Lowes.  </p>
<p><i> Islam is a peaceful religion practiced by over 1.5 billion people, including Americans across our great nation and Lowe&rsquo;s own employees.  As President Bush declared, and President Obama reaffirmed, America is not at war with Islam.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a religion of peace, just like Bush said.  Never mind what your eyes tell you, it&rsquo;s peaceful and if you don&rsquo;t agree you&rsquo;re a terrible bigot.  This weirdo then rambles on about Timothy McVeigh and the Aryan Nations as evidence that Islam poses no more threat than the grey haired old ladies attending Mass.  </p>
<p>Sometimes it just seems that all non-whites are in league to destroy this nation.      </p>

Ted Lieu illustrates what&rsquo;s wrong with government in California.  The state has a 3 billion dollar budget hole it needs to fill and this guy is complaining about Lowe&rsquo;s pulling an ad?  </p>
<p>There are many important life and death issues that seem to go unaddressed every year. The entire public pension system in California is on the verge of imploding even diehard liberal Jerry Brown has characterized the state&rsquo;s various plans as &#8220;Ponzi Scheme&#8221;.  In light of such dire and pressing fiscal problems an ad on a simple television program pales in comparison to fiscal collapse that California may be facing. </p>

Boycott?! I&rsquo;d say Lowe&rsquo;s deserves a &ldquo;buycott&rdquo; for this one. Although I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m thrilled about their bi-lingual signs in stores. But this idiotic show is such blatant propaganda that even multiculti Lowe&rsquo;s is staying clear of it.<br>

A PR biting on the backside couldn&rsquo;t have happened to a nicer corporate traitor. The Lowes corporate diversity officers think they&rsquo;re so at the vanguard multi-culti with all their bilingual signage and Hispanic floor help and language line phone interpreting services for a list of all the languages on the Census Bureau&rsquo;s language guide. But look how these people have ironically outsmarted themselves with their bilingual store signage program.</p>
<p>The section where home improvement magazines and DIY guides are merchandised are all meticulously decked out in bilingual English-Spanish signage, but I&rsquo;ve never seen a single publication published in Spanish in the entire selection of for sale reading materials. Lowes needs suing by La Raza and Thomas Perez for that transgression too.</p>

		<p>What next, fixing up all American homes with Nielson boxes and penalizing us if we don&rsquo;t watch this worthless show? If Lowe&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t wish to buy ad time during this program, that&rsquo;s their right-just as it was their right to purchase ad time in the first place.This senator is totally out of line, especially when he states (in a different article I read yesterday) that he intends to pursue legislative action against Lowe&rsquo;s. Granted, that action is just a letter of condemnation, but that&rsquo;s not the point-it&rsquo;s not this senator&rsquo;s or any legislature&rsquo;s business what a company does with its advertising budget.</p>
<p>Over on a feminist/society issues/media  site I lurk on, an article was posted about Pakistan outlawing the practice of throwing acid in women&rsquo;s faces. The revealing comments on that article were about how this meant Pakistani moslem men would &#8220;have to act like moslems now&#8221;. IOW, that site, with a readership consisting  of educated, mostly white, mostly non moslem, self proclaimed liberal westerners, ACCEPTS the notion that islam is  filled  with justice and fairness for women. When moslem societies do not demonstrate this, it&rsquo;s because of &#8220;tribal&#8221; anti islamic customs that adherence to TRUE islam would end, creating  peaceful utopias. IOW, these mostly white western women have totally accepted islam&rsquo;s own ridiculous rationalizations for its barbarities as well as its   inflated sense of worth, and are parroting it all back. If these &#8220;Jezebels&#8221; are truly representative of modern western women, then God help us&hellip;They are already so knee jerk pro islam/moslem they might as well convert. Being pro islam has become  a badge of honor and proof that one is intelligent and open minded-the battle against jihad and &#8216;creeping sharia&rsquo; may be lost before it&rsquo;s even truly begun, if these women are a true example of how modern young people feel .</p>

<p>Start voting to vote people out, don&rsquo;t concern yourself with the &#8220;in&#8221; as they can be taken care of the next election. Once politicians learn that there is no longer incumbant privilege, they will start to act in the constituents best interests - except in the gerry-mandered majority black districts.</p>

		<p>While there are certainly many Christian programs on Sunday TV, I don&rsquo;t recall seeing any of them which promote the cultural achievements of Christians or how nice and contributory Christians are.</p>
<p>It would appear that this show will be a clear attempt to demonstrate (truly enough) that the majority of Muslims are perfectly nice and civil citizens.  OK, I can buy that.  But what about the loonie militants, those who commit acts of terrorism, murder, and destruction?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need any reassurance that most Muslims are peaceable types.  We&rsquo;d all feel a lot better if the peaceable majority made serious attempts to police the radical minority.</p>

<p>Too true.  Lowe&rsquo;s is no heroic bastion of pro-White strength.  In addition to the annoying Spanish/English signs all over the place, their store in my area was built using illegal mestizo labor.</p>
<p>And since El Lowe&rsquo;s and Homespanic Depot have, between the two of them, driven all the other hardware stores out of business where I live, there&rsquo;s no where else for me to go.<br>

		<p>What are the muslims doing in our America? Why are young Native Born White American Males-the generation comming up-being forced to compete with high fertility Muslim immigrants for the scarce resources of America&hellip;such as living and breeding space? Why? </p>
<p>There are no economic,ecological,demographic and cultural reasons for importing even one muslim..there never was. 9/11 was a direct consequence of the Native Born White American destroying 1965 Immigration Reform Act.</p>
<p>The US Military officer corp is infested with traitors-General Casey-who want  thousands and thousands of muslim &#8220;Americans&#8221; to serve in the &#8220;US&#8221; Military, and at the same time state that  there are too many Whites in the &#8220;US&#8221; Military.

<p>Then there are the day labor hovels.  If you live in a Hispanic heavy area, and the local or state government isn&rsquo;t cracking down on it, then in front of every El Lowe&rsquo;s or Homespanic Depot, there&rsquo;s going to be throng of Hispanic men standing around waiting for someone to pick them up for day jobs.</p>

Oh, they&rsquo;re against a religion dominating us, but not being dominated by Hispanics who come across the border, won&rsquo;t speak English, won&rsquo;t respect our laws and want to displace the whites here?  </p>

		<p>If anybody doesn&rsquo;t think this show is absolute propaganda try imagining any non-Christian TV network running a series as positive as this about fundamentalist Christians.  It&rsquo;s almost unthinkable.  And the AVERAGE practicing Muslim makes even the most extreme snake-handling fundamentalist look like a Unitarian. <br>
They take their religion REALLY seriously.  But this isn&rsquo;t about religion, it&rsquo;s about race.  The left supports Muslims because they are non-white and anti-Western, and in any cultural conflict whites are always wrong to the left.  They must always be wrong because their existence is a crime.  Nothing illuminates the all-consuming hatred the left has for whites and the West than their embrace of Islamic immigration.  </p>

<p>This should serve as an example of why multiculturalism does not work.  One group says &#8220;pull your ads or we&rsquo;re boycotting&#8221; or something to that effect.  So they do, then ANOTHER group gets mad.  </p>
