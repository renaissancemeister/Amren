<p>Paul Sims and Louise Eccles, Daily Mail (London), December 22, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>It&rsquo;s a list that perhaps every sensible man should compile about his partner-a helpful reminder of the date you met, her birthday and her favourite music.</p>
<p>Except that these crib sheets were written by a fraudster to help him pass off his sham marriage as the real thing, and included the somewhat giveaway line: &#8216;What&rsquo;s your fencies (fiancée&rsquo;s) name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Muhammad Usman, 24, from Pakistan, wrote the detailed memo about Maria Racova, a 22-year-old Slovakian, so he could convince immigration officials and the registrar that their union was genuine.</p>
<p>It reminded him of his bride-to-be&rsquo;s nationality, that her favourite colour was red and that her preferred music was &#8216;disko&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Miss Racova&rsquo;s own memo about Usman, which like his was littered with spelling mistakes, included a reminder that the &#8216;1st time meat with hir [him] in cineworld cinma&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She also wrote that they &#8216;have been living togather last 5 moths&rsquo; in a house with two bedrooms and that the &#8216;kitch is down with siting room&rsquo;.</p>
<p>According to the memo, the &#8216;2nd flour&rsquo; has one room and her fiancé arrived in the country &rsquo;17 Jonwarry 2010&#8242;.</p>
<p>The word &#8216;mango&rsquo; also features in her notes, presumably a reference to her husband-to-be&rsquo;s favourite food.</p>
<p>The sheets of paper were discovered at Usman&rsquo;s home after UK Border Agency officers stormed in on the couple&rsquo;s sham marriage at Leeds Register Office on March 28 this year.</p>
<p>A registrar had reported her suspicions after noting the couple were not interacting with each other when they attended the office on an earlier occasion in preparation for the ceremony.</p>
<p>Yesterday the couple were sentenced at Leeds Crown Court for their part in a wider sham marriage ring in which Pakistani men used Slovak brides in an attempt to dodge UK immigration rules.</p>
<p>Slovakia is a member of the EU, so by marrying a Slovakian citizen, a person has the right to live with them in their country of residence-in this case, Britain.</p>
<p>Usman was jailed for 18 months and Racova was given to a nine-month prison term suspended for 12 months with 150 hours community service.</p>
<p>Farrukh Khan, who devised the scheme, was jailed for two years and three months. Lukas Murgos, a Slovakian who recruited the girls, was jailed for two years and six months.</p>
<p>Another Pakistani, Muhammad Mughal, was jailed for 18 months for his part in the scheme. Officers discovered that Khan and Mughal were both students whose visas had expired.</p>
<p>They had married Slovak sisters Zlatica Holubova and Ivana Holubova the previous year to seek leave to remain in the UK.</p>
<p>Ivana Holubova was sentenced to a nine-month jail term suspended for 12 months with 150 hours community service.</p>
<p>Zlatica Holubova was given a 12-month conditional discharge.</p>
<p>Syed Gardezi, who had applied to marry another Slovakian woman, was jailed for 21 months, while Slovak Eva Facunova, who acted as an interpreter, was given a 51-week sentence suspended for two years and ordered to do 200 hours of community service.</p>
<p>The court heard the group were involved in three bogus weddings. Judge James Spencer QC said the brides were in a &#8216;dire&rsquo; situation when they agreed to the marriages.</p>
<p>But sentencing the group, he said: &#8216;Each one of you has played your part in a most cynical scheme to break the immigration legislation so that those who had no right to stay here might achieve permission to stay.&rsquo;</p>
