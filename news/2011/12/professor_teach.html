<h1>Professor Teaches Class on the Wisdom of Jay-Z</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Tucker, Chicago Sun-Times, December 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michael Eric Dyson parses Jay-Z&rsquo;s lyrics as if analyzing fine literature. The rapper&rsquo;s riffs on luxury cars and tailored clothes and boasts of being the &#8220;Mike Jordan of recording&#8221; may make for catchy rhymes, but to Dyson, they also reflect incisive social commentary.</p>
<p>Dyson, a professor, author, radio host and television personality, has offered at Georgetown University this semester a popular  &mdash;  if unusual  &mdash;  class dedicated to Jay-Z and his career.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sociology of Hip Hop: Jay-Z&#8221; may seem an unlikely offering at a Jesuit, majority-white school that counts former President Bill Clinton among its alumni. But Dyson insists that his class confronts topics present in any sociology course: racial and gender identity, sexuality, capitalism and economic inequality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dyson previously taught classes on Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye at the University of Pennsylvania. {snip}</p>

		<p>&hellip;and yet we still wonder why the value of a higher education has plummeted in the U.S.? </p>
<p>Thanks to the U.S. Department of Education and fraud outfits like the University of Phoenix, blacks can now earn a &#8220;doctorate&#8221; in black studies or some other such nonsense and stick the bill to the taxpayer by defaulting on his or her loans. </p>
<p>Then the liberals at these universities bend over backwards and hire these black &#8220;doctors&#8221; to teach courses on rap music, black history, black art, black cinema, black theater, black literature (lol!), etc., and award them handsome salaries and benefits so that they can continue to infect young </p>
<p>Another symptom of the  failing and broken system known as BRA (Black-Run America) </p>

		<p>a thousand times I have told my liberal sister that the result of the civil rights scam has been dragging whites down to the level of blacks, not bringing blacks up.  <br>
the content of character crap that michael king spouted was only the ploy to help drag us all down&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
isn&rsquo;t this a lovely country and culture now that we are being dragged down, kicking and screaming to the level of shupac or leshaun or kobie or sharpton or any other of the number of black miscreants we have to tolerate?</p>

		<p>This appears to be just another easy passing grade watered down feel good class for all of the students who get in due to ethnic quotas but then fail to perform on the same level as the other students. I&rsquo;m sure being able to quote Jay-Z is really going to be useful when attending job interviews. This should really give those poor oppressed students a real head start in the workforce.</p>

		<p>For the current academic year, Georgetown&rsquo;s tuition is $40,920 for the full year or $1,705 per credit-hour.  And what do you get for it?  One black whack job singing the praises of another black whack job who should probably be chopping rocks for the next 10-20.</p>

		<p>You know, among the many black related things I&rsquo;m fed up with, this especially kind of sticks in my craw.</p>
<p>I remember one day while teaching at a mostly black school, some kind of big bongo pep rally or something&hellip;and they had these step dancers or something gyrating and dry humping the floor&hellip;and I&rsquo;m having to smile and pretend to think it was something really awesome and artistic&hellip;</p>
<p>Sick of having to smile distantly, politely, and nod graciously when I here some moron extolling the virtue and &#8220;genius&#8221; of some afro-rap star.  Amazing.</p>

<p>I can also tell you that without a doubt, 90% of the students studying Jayz and his cultural relevance,  which I put somewhere between Garbage Pail Kids and pop rocks, are white girls.  Sad.  </p>

		<p>This type of behavior makes me so angry.  I was a naive liberal who majored if English and took classes on Toni Morrison and hip hop.  I listened to my black professor who encouraged us to take the unbeaten path and become writers and professional thinkers.  Now, in spite of the fact that I have a degree from Duke University, I&rsquo;ve been unemployed for a year. No wonder the kids in the Pratt School of Engineering used to call the Trinity College of Arts &amp; Sciences the Trinity College of Arts &amp; Crafts.  And they would always talk about how they just wrote a 10 pages &#8220;bull paper.&#8221;  I was the only one taking it seriously.  Now I have to teach myself programming languages to become a computer programmer.</p>
<p>I find Michael Eric Dyson and his ilk to be without conscience.  How can they sleep at night knowing they teach their students useless garbage?  The black kids just take the classes because they&rsquo;re fun and a social outlet, not to mention an opportunity to get easy As.</p>
<p>If I had to do all over again, I would have stayed far away from the humanities and liberal arts. I would have earned a BS in Computer Science or Engineering, even if it kicked my behind. If I had children, I would forbid them from majoring in liberal arts. </p>

		<p>The reason that blacks are always going on about Jay Z and Tupac Shakur&rsquo;s &#8220;poetry&#8221; etc. is because there is no one else to take pride in.  There are no explorers, no philosophers, and no scientists.  There is no significant black or African feats of engineering or architecture and no true literature or epic sagas that would be considered to be a contribution to world culture or learning. There are only sports stars, rap &#8220;artists,&#8221; and civil rights heros and agitators - grievance specialists who keep up a pretence about everything and over-inflate historical events for an artificial importance in the world and in the U.S. especially (black slaves built America is a common example).  If it weren&rsquo;t so utterly dangerous it would invoke a sense of pity.</p>

<p>Not really that surprising, as Bill Clinton was routinely described   &mdash;   often by blacks themselves   &mdash;   as &#8220;America&rsquo;s first black president&#8221;. (Bill Clinton, Jerry Brown, the guys who founded Sao Paolo   &mdash;   sheesh, those Jesuits have a lot to answer for.) </p>
<p><br>
<i>But Dyson insists that his class confronts topics present in any sociology course: racial and gender identity, sexuality, capitalism and economic inequality.</i></p>
<p>Sadly, this is correct: that IS in any sociology course today   &mdash;   not an impartial study of society, but rather highly politicized Marxoid critiques which presuppose White American Guilt.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 2 is right. As a university student, I witness daily the amount of useless information taught. Sociology and anthropology students are especially useless, full of the worst of the liberal nonsense.  Anthropology and sociology are both taught in the ridiculous race unrealist way. <br>
More than any other subjects, the brainwashing from anthropology and sociology on cultural relativity have led society to its current ridiculous denial of race.</p>
<p>I expect a huge backlash in my generation, very soon, against the &#8220;liberal&#8221; arts.  The Obama zombies are going to wake up.</p>

<p>Listening to him talk I get the sense that his words and his reasoning (such that it is) do not completely match up.</p>
<p>I can almost imagine him talking to an all-Black group.  &#8220;I use the white man&rsquo;s words against him,&#8221; I bet he says. </p>

That he was a typical gang banger &#8220;rapping&#8221; about the hellish ghettos and lifestyle he and his &#8220;brothers&#8221; created themselves? That despite his success,fame and money, he STILL chose a thuggish lifestyle that resulted in his murder? Of course, I&rsquo;m sure this &#8220;professor&#8221; has a whole different take on the reality. Why do colleges allow this nonsense? THEY know these &#8220;classes&#8221; are useless as well. </p>
