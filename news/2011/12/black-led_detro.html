			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Christoff, Bloomberg, December 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The law that threatens Detroit with direct state rule may be repealed through a petition drive powered by unions and residents opposed to white control of a city that&rsquo;s 82 percent black.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s nothing but a takeover bill,&#8221; said Brandon Jessup, chairman of the Stand Up for Democracy coalition seeking 161,300 signatures to place the measure on the November ballot. &#8220;This is definitely a race issue. It&rsquo;s affecting people of color not only in this generation but future generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detroit has the highest concentration of blacks among U.S. cities with more than 100,000 residents, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. It will exhaust its cash by April and may run up a deficit topping $200 million by June.</p>
<p>Last week, Governor Rick Snyder, a white Republican, ordered a review that may lead to appointment of an emergency manager, rekindling rancor in a city scarred by race riots in 1967. Detroit lost one-quarter of its population since 2000  &mdash;  much of it to largely white suburbs.</p>
<p>Four Michigan cities are controlled by emergency managers. All have populations that are mostly black. If Detroit joins them, 49.7 percent of the state&rsquo;s black residents would live under city governments in which they have little say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I view an emergency manager as a situation I want to avoid,&#8221; the governor said yesterday in an interview at the Capitol in Lansing. &#8220;I&rsquo;m really supportive of the mayor and council coming up with solutions that will structurally solve these problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Councilwoman JoAnn Watson compared the city&rsquo;s resistance to Rosa Parks&rsquo; refusal to move to the back of a bus, an act that began the Montgomery boycott in 1955 and a civil-rights watershed.</p>
<p>Councilman Kwame Kenyatta said an emergency manager would be &#8220;a master, as someone to control the plantation,&#8221; according to the Detroit Free Press.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detroit&rsquo;s white flight began in the 1950s as auto companies and suppliers closed and suburban housing opened up, he said. A 1967 riot brought 43 deaths and required the intervention of the National Guard and regular Army troops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Detroit is familiar with takeovers. In 1999, the state assumed power over the city&rsquo;s schools under then-Governor John Engler, igniting charges of racism from Detroiters who disrupted a state Senate committee. {snip}</p>
<p>The schools reverted to an elected local board in 2005, and were placed under an emergency manager in 2009 by Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm. Both Engler and Granholm are white.</p>

		<p>And for all the white citizens of Detroit, the remaining 15% of the population or so? Aren&rsquo;t they being controlled by all this &#8216;racism&rsquo; too. By a city council that&rsquo;s all black? Are they calling for diversity there? Diversity in every school, office, and workplace there in Detroit, too? Well, as it happens, actually they are, and perhaps they are calling for more diversity even more passionately than anywhere else. But what they mean by diversity and tolerance in &#8216;Detroit&rsquo; is even more tolerance and favors and empowerment and consideration for those who look just like themselves. It&rsquo;s called being able to accurately and adequately serve the population and being able to address the special needs and properly represent the general public, in those towns. In fact, every large city has passed laws  mandating that you reside inside the city as a requirement to work for or sometimes with the city. And they&rsquo;re passionately calling for even more &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;. </p>

The sad part is those race baiting retorts are about maintaining power and influence, largely to benefit the black politicians.  It has nothing to do with what is best for Detroit&rsquo;s citizens.</p>

		<p>It occurred to me years ago that black people need to be &#8216;kept.&rsquo; That is, most blacks are incapable of sustaining a viable community above stone-age, pre-Columbian Africa standards. </p>
<p>The difference between black and white communities is telling:</p>
<p>White communities are self-sufficient, save the few who &#8216;fall through the cracks.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Black communities are self-destructive, save the few who &#8216;rise above the cracks.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Brandon Jessup says it&rsquo;s &#8220;definitely a race issue&#8221;. You&rsquo;re right! It IS a race issue. Blacks run amok destroying everything in their path and, as usual, Whites have to step in and try to undo black bafoonery. And the Whites get blamed for black incompetence. Take it over and to heck with the endless blame game.<br>

		<p> If there was ever a black-run city that desperately NEEDS a White &#8220;master,&#8221; it&rsquo;s Detroit. These people have their nerve, complaining about a state management takeover when it&rsquo;s black officials, prediminantly black unions, etc., which over a period of years have run the city into a hole from which it now can&rsquo;t climb out. Detroit needs some adults in charge for a change.</p>

		<p>The ace of spades among race cards is the &#8216;slavery card.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s played with impunity, drawing upon distory (distorted history) as a slight of hand. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider. </p>
<p>• True or False: The role of Africans in the slave trade was considerable. </p>
<p>Answer: True</p>
<p>&#8220;The historians John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University estimate that <b>90 percent of those shipped to the New World were enslaved by Africans and then sold to European traders.</b> The sad truth is that without complex business partnerships between African elites and European traders and commercial agents, the slave trade to the New World would have been impossible, at least on the scale it occurred.&#8221; [Emphasis added]</p>
<p>&#8220;While we are all familiar with the role played by the United States and the European colonial powers like Britain, France, Holland, Portugal and Spain, there is very little discussion of the role Africans themselves played. And that role, it turns out, was a considerable one, especially for the slave-trading kingdoms of western and central Africa. These included the Akan of the kingdom of Asante in what is now Ghana, the Fon of Dahomey (now Benin), the Mbundu of Ndongo in modern Angola and the Kongo of today&rsquo;s Congo, among several others.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Gov. Snyder:  If you have the sense that God gave a cow, don&rsquo;t do this.  Detroit will fail anyway, nothing you or your hand-picked emergency managers can possibly do will make Detroit any better, because it is an African city.  However, your rule will be a crutch that black Detroiters and the national media will constantly use to explain their own failure.</p>

		<p>Watch for civil unrest in summer 2013 after Obama is voted out.  If the country is still broke and Obama is out, blacks are going to be angry.</p>
<p>Since working tax paying whites all pretty much left the city, it hasn&rsquo;t been able to support itself.  We moved out in about 1991.  We lived in one of the last white areas of the city before being pushed to the burbs.  A black bought the last 3 houses we owned in the city.  All of the city council, police chief, fire chief are all now black. </p>
<p>The applications for employment for the city of Detroit no longer have the question: &#8220;Have you ever been convicted of a felony&#8221; because it eliminated too many blacks from employment&hellip;..god as my witness that is a true story. </p>

<p>Now that all the housing is burnt down and neighborhoods are in ruin, they are moving to the boarding burbs.  Crime is rising in the burbs and we already moved father away from the city boarder.  My next move is likely to be to rural Kentucky to retire.  </p>

<p>I guess it would be SORT of like a plantation - the ( White ) taxpayers will end up having to pay for their room and board, but they certainly won&rsquo;t get any work out of them.<br>
I say - leave them alone, COMPLETELY alone. When they fail, don&rsquo;t bail them out. Let them suffer the consequences of their incompetence.<br>

		<p>i agree with poster 11. white management alone cannot save this city. because white management, no matter how competent, will still be crippled by racial sensitivity and will not have the cahoons to inforce what really needs to be enforced. the old slave owners and others from the old south knew that it was necessary to come up with a higher form of enforcement to ever get blacks to get in lock step with the rest of us. blacks are a race of people that have never accomplished anything on their own. not one thing. they are only good for destruuction, just look at all the black areas in any big city, looks like beyond thunderdome. until we all agree (we already know), what needs to be done, and have the backbone to  do it, nothing will change. maybe we need to come up with a plan to pay blacks to be in the demolition business.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with the laws that apply to state or federal responsibility when a municipality fails to meet its financial obligations.  But as long as debts aren&rsquo;t owed to entities outside the city, I say let the inmates run the asylum, even if they show less capacity for it than the residents of zoos and wildlife preserves.</p>
<p>Of course, animals aren&rsquo;t guaranteed the Constitutional right of self-determination.</p>
<p>But somewhere between the 14th Amendment, the Civil Rights Acts, and white flight, American Africans have inherted the right to govern themselves, at least where their critical mass constitutes a majority.</p>
<p>Allow them to lay waste to the Motor City, and to recreate the ideal conditions of their tribal homelands as far as our generous laws will allow, and we can look to them as champions of rugged indepenence, and exemplars of the pursuit of happiness.  </p>

		<p>Taking over a black city doesn&rsquo;t work. We&rsquo;ve done it here in NJ with Camden, Trenton and Newark, etc all to some degree or other. If a takeover&rsquo;s going to work, the city officials can&rsquo;t  have any say in spending one red cent. Nor can they have a salary or any other perks of office. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re lost before you start.</p>

		<p>They will never learn anything as long it is possible for them to blame somebody else for their shortcomings. White management is just covering up this failure, and they will slowly move over to other places where they can begin anew. No change here and I cannot imagine any real change will be before taxation is so high that crime is the sane income for 60-80%. The ill will to see where this devolution is heading is so strong.</p>

		<p>It won&rsquo;t do any good to send an emergency manager to Detroit this late in the day. Large portions of Detroit consist of abandoned buildings which are falling apart, not to mention the problems which come from a mostly black population.

		<p>There might be a small number of blacks that could govern, but it seems that 100% of them become corrupt with much power&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>How many examples do you need to see this?</p>
<p>Show me an honest black politician&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, there aren&rsquo;t many white honest politicians either.</p>
<p>I like to believe that there were some in the past, whites, that is.   Now, money is more important than their souls&hellip;..</p>
<p>For blacks, it seems to be they are all lost souls in the governing dept.</p>

		<p>Does anybody remember &#8220;Escape from new york&#8221;? Great concept! That is probably the best fix for this problem.(I did not capitalize new york as all respect has been lost) for this horrible state. </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, whites can&rsquo;t just let blacks create and live in their own ghettos. That would be raaaaaaacist. No, blacks will follow the tax base they need to be artificially propped up, and liberal politicians will enable them to do just that. One way or another, we will pay for them. It&rsquo;s the least we can do for our ancestors giving their ancestors a vastly better life than they would have had in Africa.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, no one mentions the tax grants and favors that Detroit receives every year to the tune of 700,000,000 State and Federal dollars. This number doesn&rsquo;t include the flood of welfare, EIC, HUD etc. It&rsquo;s clearly well over a billion dollars a year that is stolen from suburban whites to support just this one disaster. Imagine that, bankrupt blacks with an extra billion a year yet the whites depleted of a billion still thrive. </p>
<p>Can the facts this picture paints be denied forever??? Apparently!</p>
