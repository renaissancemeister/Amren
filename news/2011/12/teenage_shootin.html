<h1>Teenage Shooting Victim Remembered as Family Oriented, Athletic</h1>
					
					<p>Katherine Snow Smith, Tampa Bay Times, December 25, 2011</p>					
					
									
                
                	
	                	<p>Carl Lee Martin was remembered on Christmas Eve by friends and neighbors as a good athlete and someone who made others smile.</p>
<p>Martin, 15, died Thursday night when Demontray Lovett, 18, of St. Petersburg accidently fired a .40-caliber handgun from the back seat of a stolen minivan, St. Petersburg police said. The bullet went through the right front passenger seat and hit Martin in the torso. Lovett and Martin were part of a group of five people in the van headed for St. Pete Beach, investigators said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Saturday, many neighbors at the Citrus Grove Apartments on 15th Street S, where Martin lived with his mother and siblings, were solemn.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a good person. He made everybody laugh,&#8221; said neighbor Melanee Rogers.</p>
<p>Martin, she said, was very close to his family and often played football with his younger siblings.</p>
<p>Martin&rsquo;s Facebook page was filled Saturday with messages from friends who said they will miss him and that life can change so fast. He attended Pinellas Secondary School.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was one of the older guys I would see telling younger ones to do what&rsquo;s right,&#8221; said James Smith, a pastor at Campbell Park Community Church who led a basketball outreach program that included Martin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In May, Martin was charged with robbery but the case was later dropped, state records show.</p>
