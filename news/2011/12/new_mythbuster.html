<h1><a href="http://www.thelocal.se/38012/20111219/">New &#8216;Mythbuster&rsquo; Website to Fight Racism in Sweden</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local, December 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Swedish government has launched a new website to combat the proliferation of inaccurate and racist myths about minorities and immigrants in Sweden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extremism has found a new forum which is also very effective when it comes to spreading myths and prejudice,&#8221; integration minister Erik Ullenhag of the Liberal Party (Folkpartiet) writes in an opinion piece published Monday in the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper.</p>
<p>Ullenhag cites a report issued earlier in the year by the Forum for Living History (Forum f√∂r levande historia) which found there had been a dramatic increase in the number of racist websites in Sweden in recent years.</p>
<p>While racism is hardly a new phenomenon, writes Ullenhag, racist myths and stereotypes have found a new foothold on the web, and must be addressed there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prejudice will be met with the facts that exist,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>The new site, regeringen.se/tolerans, attempts to debunk a number of &#8220;common internet myths about immigrants and minorities&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;One always needs to engage in debates about xenophobia and prejudice,&#8221; writes Ullenhag, who also warns of the dangers of &#8220;the silence of forces for good&#8221;.</p>
<p>Among the myths addressed on the website are claims that Sweden will soon be a Muslim country, that Swedes are on their way to becoming a minority in their own country, and that Swedish children are no longer allowed to eat pork in school.</p>
<p>In announcing the launch of the new website, Ullenhag goes on to explain that a number of the myths addressed on the site have &#8220;even found their way into debates in the Riksdag&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can therefore see how internet prejudices can be found in the political debate,&#8221; writes Ullenhag.</p>

		<p>Multi culturalism is such a great thing  yet the elite play down the numbers, the cultural shifts &amp; the inevitable long term consequence which is national obliteration.Its this mendacity which really irks. Will the website be open to healthy scepticism or will critics receive a knock on the door? But at least they are acknowledging the nationalist counterculture is making an impact.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Swedish government has launched a new website to combat the proliferation of inaccurate and racist myths about minorities and immigrants in Sweden.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve launched a new web site to try to cover up the massive amounts of crimes, and other problems immigrants are guilty of, because they know that their society is on the brink&hellip;..or close to it.</p>
<p>The Swedish government is guilty of interjecting an alien, criminal culture in their society which never had a chance of working in the first place, so now they&rsquo;re stepping up their disingenuous spin trying to flim flam the public into believing they&rsquo;re haters if they complain about it.</p>
<p>The same is true throughout Europe and the rest of the West.  All of the countries involved must keep a Big Brother mantra going 24/7 or they&rsquo;ll split apart in civil war if they don&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>But their efforts are useless, because multicultural societies have always failed, and they always will.  Add a downward spiraling global economy, that threatens to begin a donmino fall in Europe soon, and governmental efforts at trying to stave off the inevitable really come across as pitiful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just hoping that the guilty government bureaucrats and corporate greed mongers will be held accountable for their evil  actions after it is all over just like the Nazis at Nuremburg.<br>

<p>Yeah, because who are we going to believe?  You and your propaganda website, or our own lying eyes?</p>
<p>I doubt any &#8220;nativist&#8221; Swede is saying that Sweden will &#8220;soon&#8221; be majority Muslim or non-Swedish, or that Swedish children can&rsquo;t eat pork.  Those are straw dog arguments.</p>

		<p>I would assume that amongst the myths they will be discrediting:</p>
<p>Immigrants consume a vastly disproportionate amount of public resources and public assistance dollars.</p>
<p>Immigrants are responsible for an outrageously disproportionate number of violent crimes in every city that they inhabit.</p>
<p>Radical Islam is a serious problem within the &#8220;Muslim community&#8221; and Swedish Muslims (at least a large percentage of them) would welcome Sharia and a Scandinavian caliphate. </p>
<p>Get real. The Left&rsquo;s great strength is the idealistic appeal (to whites) and the dole (to everyone else). They have very little claim to Truth because the facts are stacked against them. I will be intrigued to see this website when it is released. <br>

		<p>Clear case of a formerly trusted shepherd leading his sheep to the slaughter by convincing them that wolves that are circling their pen are just myths&hellip;that to think otherwise is the epitome of evil. Yet this shepherd himself won&rsquo;t dare leave the pen out of fear of being devoured by the very wolves he claims are not there. When forced to admit the wolves exist, when too many sheep become aware of the shepherd&rsquo;s lies about the wolves not existing&hellip;he switches tact and says the wolves exist but have no teeth. When that fails to hold up under scrutiny&hellip;the shepherds say that the wolves are herbavores. When that lie also fails to stand up, the shepherd again switches tact and says that the wolves may eat meat but have no taste for mutton. </p>

		<p>Myth: Liberal Sweden, due to its Feminism and other Orwellian ideas, will not become a weakened state on every level. Its effeminate men and masculine women will able to defend against any real crisis.</p>
<p>Fact: Multiple crises will envelop Sweden and Europe itself. If, for some reason Sweden doesn&rsquo;t fall due to a more aggressive dominant group I guarantee, it will fall due to a war.</p>

		<p>So far is the left responsible for ALL the lies in every race and migration issue. They have always opposed every official attempt to figure out what immigration costs taxpayers, so estimates comes usually from private research.<br>
This agency will be another nail in the coffin of the Scandinavian socialism. They will fabricate lies which becomes standing jokes. When the ridicule gets going it will be so strong it might even wash away the fear of being called a racist.</p>
<p>Its time to recycle russian jokes for using them on the swedes - Who once put down the foundation for Russia.<br>
Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev once took the train to inspect their country. But it wouldn&rsquo;t leave the platform. Lenin went forward and kept flaming speeches to motivate the personnel and came back. The train stood still. Stalin went forward and shoot everyone. The train stood still. After some minutes Brezhnev enthusiastically claimed &#8221; we are now leaving the station&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Gee, a government minister and a brigade of bureaucrats are going to deal with the problem. There was a time when debate was encouraged in western countries. It is the right thing to do. Can we ask for just a small amount of that massive resource to have some public debates with white spokesmen like AmRen and similars? For sure, there will be educated opinions that disagree with the official government myths. Let the public decide.</p>

		<p>Ah, the thankless job of debunking myths&hellip; . When whites were 90% of the population of the USA, Senator Kennedy declared the immigration act of 1965 would in no way change the racial balance of the nation. Senator Humphry declared he would &#8220;Eat his hat&#8221; if in any way the civil rights act of 1965 led to discrimination against white Americans&#8221;. Whites are now 65% of the populaton (with white children at 50% and falling, and every private and public institution in the country practices &#8216;affirmatve action&rsquo; and has a &#8216;diversity&rsquo; plan in place. </p>
<p>The only difference between Sweden and the USA is 50 years, and the fact that both still have in power &#8216;myth busters&rsquo; setting us all straight. And perhaps SAAB at least has a chance to build a better car than Chrysler.  </p>

		<p>There was one &#8220;myth&#8221; that I wanted to check out from the website, and to see how they answered it. It was the question of whether or not Swedes would eventually become a minority in their own country. I just had to shake my head as I read their response to this&hellip; loosely translated, it went something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;<br>
Myth: Swedes will eventually become a minority in their own country.<br>
Answer: No, this is an outright lie based on false presumptions. Today 15% of the Swedish population are foreign born, and the most recent statistics show that in 2050 this number is likely to be 16%. The myth is based on the lie that you are not Swedish even if you are born in Sweden but just happen to have parents from a different background.<br>
&#8220;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even clever fudging of statistics&hellip; yes, we are well aware that by 2050 Swedes (people with Swedish passports born in Sweden) will still be a majority in the country - but I believe that so called mythbuster site would have had a harder time answering the &#8220;myth&#8221; that &#8220;ETHNIC Swedes will eventually become a minority in their own country&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ah well. </p>
<p>As a Dane, I can only hope our kinsmen to the north eventually come to their senses!</p>

		<p>Why am I not surprised that this would appear here? Anyway<br>
they have made some serious errors here mixing untruth with<br>
worddribbling. There are major efforts made as we speak to<br>
counter their claims and showing them on various websites.<br>
For instance this site claims that it is a myth that most<br>
are not even refugees, well most people that come are what<br>
we call anh√∂riginvandring which means that they have relatives<br>
already living here so these people are not refugees! Ullenhag<br>
has really done it this time, my personal theory is that it is<br>
a mixture of stupidity and desperation.</p>

&#8220;Immigrants in Sweden are four times more likely to be investigated for lethal violence and robbery than persons born in Sweden to Swedish parents, the National Council for Crime Prevention said on Wednesday.&#8221; (<a href="http://m.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=2683&amp;date=20051214" rel="nofollow">source</a>)</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not a site, it&rsquo;s merely a statement on the swedish governments site.<br>
It&rsquo;s just got a catchy direct-link.</p>
<p>And Forum for Living History (Forum f√∂r levande historia), was created to make sure that swedes never forget the holocaust (and how horrible white europeans are, and what guilt they have in other peoples misery).<br>
It was a big row on that, when some politicians argumented that they should document and publish communist crimes against humanity as well, that apparently was not the organisations purpose.</p>
<p><br>
Anyways, the myths they are dispelling is hilarious, or rather the way they do it in is spectacularly so.</p>
<p>Here is a link to google translation of it.<br>
<a href="http://bit.ly/tF0uOS" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/tF0uOS</a><br>
Note that the translation for some reasons puts bold on all the text instead of just the headlines, making it a little harder to read, dunno why it does that.</p>
<p>Like this<br>
Myth 1: There is a mass migration, a few decades, the Swedes to be in the minority in their own country.<br>
[answer]<br>
The claim is directly wrong. Today, almost 15 percent of the population born in another country. Statistics Office expects an almost unchanged share in the future, the proportion is projected to increase to 16.5 percent 2050th </p>
<p><br>
Yeah, the amount of foreign-born will be the same, but it says nothing about the amount of people born to foreign-born people.<br>
After all, a swede is anyone born in Sweden and has a swedish citizenship, right?</p>
<p><br>
And this<br>
Myth 12: If one questions of immigration and integration policies so you will be branded a racist.<br>
[answer]<br>
Few issues are debated as often and as lively as integration and migration policies. Political debates can sometimes heat up considerably. Anyone who argues with the help of racist and xenophobic myths often meet strong, legitimate backlash. </p>
<p><br>
Myth: If you argue agaisnt immigration you will be branded a racist.<br>
Answer: Yes, arguing against immigration is racist and you will be branded a racist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This whole thing is a laughing stock on swedish sites in it&rsquo;s utter ridiculousness.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone who &#8220;debates immigration&#8221; will be &#8220;branded a racist.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s just that the overton window on the immigration issue doesn&rsquo;t include us.  If you debate immigration outside the &#8220;permissible bounds of discussion&#8221; (the overton window), you will be &#8220;branded a racist.&#8221;  Any hint that only white Swedes can really be Swedish or that immigration policy should be constructed around Sweden remaining a majority (real) Swedish country, and therefore, non-whites should be deported and not allowed to immigrate, is outside the overton window.  Any allowed opposition to mass immigration will be a controlled opposition, and will still make their arguments from an &#8220;anti-white&#8221; or &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; or racially egalitarian foundation.</p>

		<p>We must debunk the myth that 99 percent of rapes in Sweden are committed by African, Arab, Turkish, Pakistani and Afghani immigrants.</p>
<p>Soon they will eliminate the race description of Swedish rape victims and the rapists.  Soon we&rsquo;ll see Swedish versions of &#8220;Of Mice and Men&#8221; and &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221;</p>
<p>We can also anticipate a Swedish version of the Scottsboro Boys rape with wealthy elite Swedish women advocating that ordinary Swedish women offer themselves to these people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the education department has prepared lesson plans encouraging Swedish school girls to submit to the rapists desires or be labeled racist and jailed for hate crime and discrimination.  Swedish feminazis probably have counselor jobs in the schools where the non-whites can report the girls for racism after being rejected.</p>

When the wolf is finally at their throat and they realize that their policy was wrong, look at what is left of Swedish culture and the people. Sweden will go into the dustbin of history and future Swedes will know only the glorious history of the Islamic conquerors because their own history will have been rubbed out. </p>

<p>Does the government really think people consider black Africans born in Sweden to be &#8220;Swedes&#8221; or that people are referring to people with citizenship when they say &#8216;Swedes will become a minority&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Among the myths addressed on the website are claims that Sweden will soon be a Muslim country, that Swedes are on their way to becoming a minority in their own country, and that Swedish children are no longer allowed to eat pork in school.</p>
<p>Yeah, because who are we going to believe? You and your propaganda website, or our own lying eyes?</p>
<p>I doubt any &ldquo;nativist&rdquo; Swede is saying that Sweden will &ldquo;soon&rdquo; be majority Muslim or non-Swedish, or that Swedish children can&rsquo;t eat pork. Those are straw dog arguments.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Actually, we are.<br>
The reason for this is that pork is &#8220;haram&#8221;, forbidden, according to muslims. And not just to eat, but to even be close to.<br>
So they demand &#8220;halal&#8221;-food, &#8220;clean&#8221; food, and that means schools have to have multiple meals (in Sweden all school lunches are free) to accomodate their needs.<br>
And some of the more fanatic get upset if the haram food is even close to the halal food, and if it comes into contact with each other in even the most remote way, then the sacred food is spoiled.<br>
Meaning they need separate cooking utensils, serparate plates etc.<br>
In the end, it becomes much more cheap to have everyone eat the same meal, namely the halal one.<br>
Effectively meaning no more pork in school.<br>
As well as a number of other things deemed haram by the bigwigs.<br>
As an example, halal-meat has to be imported, since the halal-butchery is against swedish animal protection rights (the animal has to be dead or stunned before you cut it&rsquo;s throat so that it won&rsquo;t suffer needlessly, while halal-rules is that the animal must be conscious while dying by bleeding out).</p>

<p>We must debunk the myth that 99 percent of rapes in Sweden are committed by African, Arab, Turkish, Pakistani and Afghani immigrants.</p>
<p>Soon they will eliminate the race description of Swedish rape victims and the rapists. Soon we&rsquo;ll see Swedish versions of &ldquo;Of Mice and Men&rdquo; and &ldquo;To Kill a Mockingbird&rdquo;<br>

Description?<br>
Please, Margaret, you obviously don&rsquo;t know swedish rules and laws. Such things aren&rsquo;t recorded. Race isn&rsquo;t recorded the way it is in USA, here we only go by country of birth. And by the country of birth of your parents.<br>
And swede simply means you have swedish citizenships. They are actually calling immigrants &#8220;new-swedes&#8221;.<br>
So if your name is Achmed Al-habib, and is born in Sweden from parents born in Sweden (but whose parents in turn, all come from Pakistan), then there isn&rsquo;t possible in any way to differentiate between you and an actual ethnic swede.</p>
<p>Which is why swedes often talk about 2nd generation immigrants, because that is the ONLY thing that is registered about that that differs between a ethnic swede in records and statistics.<br>
And in most reports, they don&rsquo;t even count 2nd generation immigrants as non-swedes.<br>
And of course, that classification makes it impossible to differentiate between some Muhammed from Iraq and some Erik with one parent from Denmark and the other from Norway.</p>

If this website allows an open debate on the advantages and disadvantages of multiculturalism, as well as racial differences regarding intelligence and crime, and the possible genetic reasons for those differences, I will welcome it.<br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, whenever multiculturalists control the debate they suppress opposing viewpoints. This indicates that they are afraid of arguments they cannot refute. </p>

		<p>Its pretty hopeless to fight the rising wave of nativist/anti-foreigner sentiment rising on swedish web sites that allow talkback. There is a kind of information guerilla warfare going on with the government PC spreaders getting besieged instantly. <br>
They just don&rsquo;t have the public confidence. Its automatically assumed that they are lying. Its not just them, its also our &#8220;free&#8221; press. Swedish journalists are automatically considered liars by net.Swedes. </p>
<p>This is also a generation thing, older Swedes are much more naive and trusting, younger are not. You can see much more anti-multicultural/racist chatter today than ten years ago and in another ten years ago today&rsquo;s &#8220;I&rsquo;m not a racist but&hellip;blah blah&#8221; will be &#8220;I&rsquo;m a racist and I&hellip;..&#8221;.</p>
<p>Peak oil, mass immigration, general economic dysfunction (globalization/increasing financialization sends our value-adding industry abroad) and deteriorating social capital will drop GNP/capita in Sweden to former East bloc levels. Meanwhile, our decadent elites are like the bourbons in 18th century France, partying on while the peasantry are getting leaner and leaner. I would give multicult Sweden another 20-25 years before it blows up. </p>

<p>Sorry to tell you that the last part of your prediction has already happened.  I received or found a link to a youtube film a couple years ago wherein a rap style song urged Swedes to &#8220;Mix it up,&#8221; while Swedes and blacks danced around suggestively. But that wasn&rsquo;t all; at a point it cut away to a beautiful blond singing words from the Swedish National Anthem, &#8220;Oh, serene Sweden, so happy and so free,&#8221; while bouncing nude, up and down in either real or faked copulation (but it didn&rsquo;t look it) on a supinated black man.</p>
<p>I had arguments with posters on that site for months afterward.</p>

		<p>In the nursing home after the latest operation to repair my smashed pelvis and legs after a hit and run by an illegal with a stolen car and no license, I brought along 2 books.  I selected them mostly because they were large size and about 900 pages apiece.</p>
<p>They were biographies of Jack and Sarah Churchill, the first Duke and Duchess of Marlbrough.  They operated about 1670 to 1720.</p>
<p>What amazed me was the amount of free discussion there was in England at the time.  There was severe goverment censorship, but there was a little printshop in every neighborhood and village.<br>
Huge amounts of dissident opinions were published.  Much more than there is today.</p>
<p>We have that no longer.  The mass media, goverment and academia are in lockstep.</p>
<p>The internet is the 21st century version of the pamphleter of 17th century Europe.</p>

Actually, the whole Assange-case has been greatly exaggerated. The swedish justice system isn&rsquo;t hard on rapist, or any type of criminals (except tax-evasion, which has penalties on level with murder).<br>
There are a lot of rapes in Sweden, but far from all are reported, and far from all are properly investigated and even fewer make it to court and risks of getting convicted is still not that high, despite that they only prosecute those that they have good evidence on.<br>
Look at the link above, in post #22, the raped girl Linda there, the bloodied face. Attacked, beaten with a expanding baton, raped, robbed and finally kicked in the crotch so hard she broke her pelvis.<br>
Her 4 attackers got the following punishments. One got of free, because he was only looking on. Two got 3 months each, with time served, meaning they walked free right after the trial. The fourth one got 2 years.<br>
Admittedly, all was under 18, which gave them lower punishments, but still, the penalties in Sweden is laughably low compared to USA (the longest time-determined penalty for any crime is a mere 14 years, then of course there is a life sentence, but judging from average times spent in jail before pardon, life in Sweden is very short, just 20 years or so).</p>
<p>In the Assange-case, he hasn&rsquo;t been convicted of anything, and the justice system hasn&rsquo;t even got to work on him. What has happened is that the woman filed a complaint of rape against him, and police is investigating in and wants to have an interrogation with Assange, which is why they&rsquo;ve sent out an arrest warrant for him. He hasn&rsquo;t even been prosecuted for rape yet, they are still in the preparatory phase.</p>
<p>And there is very little chance he will get convicted, while the lower courts are politized due to how the swedish juror-system works (politically appointed full-time jurors in lower courts) you can always appeal to higher courts, where the jurors are not politically appointed, and have no problems quashing political sentences.</p>

Most younger swedes have decent english, we study english from grade 4 up to gymnasium (high school equivalent), so basically 9 years of english studies.<br>
Usually the only problems are grammar and proper use of words and terms.<br>

<p>Print plenty of these out and half them ready and on you for &#8220;when the time is right.&#8221;  I once scoffed at this notion, but an undergrad business law prof of mine, a woman, when she did a diversion at the end of the class for practical legal tips, gave us horror story after horror story after horror story about &#8220;rape&#8221; allegations that weren&rsquo;t true but destroyed the accused rapist&rsquo;s reputation.  I stopped laughing after that day.  The version of such a contract I have is longer and more complicated than this, (use your imagination to figure out how and why), but I had a lawyer acquaintance write out for me not long after I took that class, and I don&rsquo;t have it digitized.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s overly legalistic.  You know what&rsquo;s even more overly legalistic?  A rape investigation and trial.</p>

Note that all politics in Sweden is to the left of american politics, and the swedish right is a few steps to the left of Obama.<br>
The american right would be called fascists in Sweden, and the swedish left would be called communists in USA (rightly so, since they removed the word communist from their partyname just after the fall of the soviet union, but kept the same politics).</p>
