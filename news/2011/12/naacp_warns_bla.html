<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/05/civil-rights-naacp-voter-warning">NAACP Warns Black and Hispanic Americans Could Lose Right to Vote</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Pilkington, Guardian (London), December 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The largest civil rights group in America, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), is petitioning the UN over what it sees as a concerted effort to disenfranchise black and Latino voters ahead of next year&rsquo;s presidential election.</p>
<p>The organisation will this week present evidence to the UN high commissioner on human rights of what it contends is a conscious attempt to &#8220;block the vote&#8221; on the part of state legislatures across the US. Next March the NAACP will send a delegation of legal experts to Geneva to enlist the support of the UN human rights council.</p>
<p>The NAACP contends that the America in the throes of a consciously conceived and orchestrated move to strip black and other ethnic minority groups of the right to vote. William Barber, a member of the association&rsquo;s national board, said it was the &#8220;most vicious, co-ordinated and sinister attack to narrow participation in our democracy since the early 20th century&#8221;.</p>
<p>In its report, Defending Democracy: Confronting Modern Barriers to Voting Rights in America, the NAACP explores the voter supression measures taking place particularly in southern and western states.</p>
<p>Fourteen states have passed a total of 25 measures that will unfairly restrict the right to vote, among black and Hispanic voters in particular.</p>
<p>The new measures are focused  &mdash;  not coincidentally, the association insists  &mdash;  in states with the fastest growing black populations (Florida, Georgia, Texas and North Carolina) and Latino populations (South Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee). The NAACP sees this as a cynical backlash to a surge in ethnic minority voting evident in 2008.</p>
<p>In that year, black and Hispanic voters turned out in record numbers, partly in a wave of enthusiasm for Barack Obama. More than 2 million extra black voters turned out over 2004, an increase of 15%.</p>
<p>Among Hispanics, the upturn was even more pronounced. Two million additional voters attended the polls  &mdash;  a rise of 28% on the previous presidential election.</p>
<p>The scale of the assault on voting rights is substantial, according to experts on electoral law. The Brennan Center for Justice, based at New York University law school, estimates that the new measures could bar as many as 5 million eligible voters from taking part in choosing the occupant of the White House next year.</p>
<p>The 14 states that have embarked on such measures hold two-thirds of the electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. Put another way, of the 12 battleground states that will determine the outcome of the presidential race, five have already cut back on voting rights and two more are in discussions about following suit.</p>
<p>Ethnic minority groups are not the only sections of society at risk of losing their voting rights. The Brennan Center warns that young voters and students, older voters and poor income groups are also vulnerable.</p>
<p>The NAACP says voting rights are being whittled down at every stage of the electoral process. First of all, the registration of new voters is being impeded in several states by moves to block voter registration drives that have historically proved to be an important way of bringing black and Hispanic people to the poll.</p>
<p>Four states  &mdash;  Florida, Iowa, Kentucky and Virginia  &mdash;  continue to withhold the vote from anyone convicted of a criminal offence. In Florida, offenders who have completed their sentences have to wait at least five years before they can even apply to restore their right to register to vote.</p>
<p>Across the US, more than 5 million Americans are denied the right to vote on grounds that they were convicted of a felony, 4 million of whom have fully completed their sentence and almost half of whom are black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>Other measures have reduced the ease of early voting, a convenience that is disproportionately heavily used by African-Americans. Even more importantly, 34 states have introduced a requirement that voters carry photo ID cards on the day of the election itself.</p>
<p>Studies have showed that the proportion of voters who do not have access to valid photo ID cards is much higher among older African-Americans because they were not given birth certificates in the days of segregation. Students and young voters also often lack identification and are thus in danger of being stripped of their right to vote.</p>
<p>In Texas, a law has been passed that prevents students from voting on the basis of their college ID cards, while allowing anyone to cast their ballot if they can show a permit to carry a concealed handgun.</p>
<p>Benjamin Jealous, the NAACP&rsquo;s president, said the moves amounted to &#8220;a massive attempt at state-sponsored voter suppression.&#8221; He added that the association will be urging the UN &#8220;to look at what is a co-ordinated campaign to disenfranchise persons of colour.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Notice how inclusive these black orgs try to be by wanting to put themselves all under the umbrella of &#8220;people of color,&#8221; against whites, when there&rsquo;s not a single group that likes or gets along with blacks in general among the rank and file?</p>
<p>In fact, none of the other races or ethnicities have anything at all in common with them, because they pretty much are able to carve out at least some kind of niche in US culture and business, so they aren&rsquo;t reduced to whining about one imagined injustice after another, designed to cover up their failures, as blacks are forced to do to save face.</p>
<p>If data revealing the achievement gaps between blacks and other non-whites were ever frequently published, as it is often done concerning the black/white gap, it would go a long way to shutting up these malcontents in the black leadership, because it would be pretty apparent everybody is doing o.k. except blacks, so they couldn&rsquo;t use their divisive tactics by placing themselves under the multicultural umbrella with everybody else.</p>
<p>And the narrative would then turn, at least to an appreciable degree, to gaps between non-whites, giving whites a bit of a break.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure if that happened there would be battle royals waged just as there is when black/Hispanic schools fight over their MLK day and Cinco de Mayo.</p>
<p>But the radical leftist MSM would never exclude whites from the equation and lose their favorite whipping boy. </p>

		<p>Perhaps people of colour should not disenfranchise themselves by committing an inordinate amount of crime. </p>
<p>I see no mention of prohibiting Blacks or Latinos or whoever from participating based solely on their race, only on their conduct.</p>
<p><br>
As an aside, the oft repeated mantra of the NAACP being the oldest (or largest) civil rights organization is preposterous.</p>
<p>The NRA has been and still is both the largest and oldest civil rights organization in the United States.</p>

		<p>There are two events which the Democratic party could use to immediately add on the order of (I&rsquo;m guessing) 10mil new Democratic voters.  The obvious one is amnesty, which is why they&rsquo;re pushing for it so hard.  The other, which people are less aware of, would be a Federal law to restore the right to vote of felons in states where felons are barred.  Given the demographics of felons (impoverished black or Amerindian Hispanics), you can be sure that felons would vote about 95% Democratic if they could vote (they can in some states).</p>
<p>If either of these two things happen (amnesty for illegal immigrants or right to vote for felons), the Republicans will never again win power at the national level.  I think enough Republicans understand this, but think how close we came: what if Obama had swept in more Democrats and they could have pushed through either of these policy goals?  We would reach a tipping point and would never tip back.  The Democrats would gain enough votes that they would never be defeated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to birth rates and immigration, we will have a non-white majority within a few decades.  Due to treasonous whites, the Republicans will be unable to win national-level power even before whites are a minority.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, here in the real world, you need photo ID to do just about anything useful, (including buying canned compressed air in Missouri), and convicted felons are legally denied many rights and privileges.</p>
<p>In reality, most states allow convicted felons to vote once they are out of prison and/or complete their probation.  The rub is, certain people (ahem) have a problem not being able to finish their probation before they commit another crime.</p>
<p>The dead may not be able to talk, but they certainly have voted Democrat.  That&rsquo;s how we know Osama bin Laden is truly departed; he just recently registered to vote in Chicago.</p>

If you get convicted of a felony, you pretty much lose the right to vote.  It&rsquo;s part of the punishment.<br>
Early voting?&hellip;That&rsquo;s lazy voting&hellip;get up and go to the polls on election day, if it&rsquo;s important to you.  (Tho&rsquo; I guess the early voting gives the preachers more time to load up their vans.)<br>
And should anyone who reaches legal age without having the minimal intelligence to get an ID card be voting on anything, anyway?<br>
Maybe one smart thing though&hellip;the UN commission in Geneva&hellip;as usual, the Africans look to the Europeans to fix the problems they have brought upon themselves.</p>

		<p>Interesting how the NAACP is directing its action to the UN, as though they have some sort of authority in US domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Voter fraud is epidemic within many inner city precincts in this country.  In Philadelphia, they&rsquo;ve actually had instances in which there were more votes cast (for Democrats, of course) than inhabitants of certain precincts.</p>
<p>Voter fraud is the most direct assault on the integrity of the republic imaginable.  It deserves the same penalty as espionage in wartime. </p>

		<p>Since this article appears in a British newspaper, it&rsquo;s a sure bet that many readers won&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s really going on.  Of course Republicans want to suppress votes that are typically Democratic, but the mentioned means are not illegal!  And, with the voter fraud that is worsening with the influx of illegals, it makes perfect sense to require photo ID&rsquo;s.  But naturally the liberals have to tell baldfaced lies to muddy the issue.  They&rsquo;ve tried to make it sound like people have to have a birth certificate to vote and then implied that someone must actually go to his place of birth to obtain one. Now the nonsense about black folks not getting birth certificates under segregation!  And the allegation that anyone in the U.S. hasn&rsquo;t ACCESS to the obtaining of ID proof?  Even illegals have no problem obtaining phony ID cards, social security cards, etc.  <br>
Well, there&rsquo;s nothing the UN can do about voter laws in the U.S., but the useless NAACP does nothing useful anyway.</p>

		<p>More crying wolf from the usual suspects.  They know that without the usual massive black voter fraud, Obama is as good as finished.  With these sensible laws, blacks know that rounding up black street walkers and other layabouts and plying them with liquor or drugs for their vote will be harder this time around.  I still chuckle every time I see that octaroon Ben Jealous flapping gums about the latest imagined atrocities committed against &#8220;his&#8221; people.  Jealous.  The name fits.  </p>

		<p>Most of those states if not all of them that prohibit felons from voting have done so and had those laws on the books more or less forever. So this is not new. Voter having an ID is just so hard [not]. It is just so hard for me to get an ID card [not]. That is just such an unobtainable item [not]. And if you did not get a birth certificate during segregation days [a small number of the electorate if almost any of the electorate] then just apply for a birth certificate and get one. This is all so hard [not]! </p>

		<p>Blocking criminals from voting doesn&rsquo;t mean the rights of all blacks and Hispanics to vote will be repealed. What a bizarre leap of logic these crybaby NAACP members and supporters (as well as black people) have. </p>
<p>Then again, I guess it hurts to note that blacks and Hispanics have higher crime rates than Whites and Asians, therefore, they make these bizarre leaps in logic. </p>

		<p>The NAACP should be officially renamed the National Association for the Advancement of the Communist Party. Ethnic minorities are much more likely to choose candidates that lean to the left or hail from their own racial group. </p>
<p>Since when did the UN gain the authority to dictate policy to our (theoretically) sovereign Nation and its individual political units known as States?</p>
<p>I would like to remind the NAACP and other leftist activists that no where within the body of the US Constitution or the Bill of Rights is voting ever mentioned as a fundamental right.</p>
<p>Voting rights were strictly limited to persons of good character and standing within their communities to prevent a faction or special interest group from gaining undue influence in an election. Voting is a privilege and not a right.</p>
<p>This country has continually deteriorated as voting rights have been gradually expanded over the years. I think that that is the NAACP&rsquo;s mission anyway to see that ole&rsquo; whitey is finally put in his place.</p>

		<p>One thing most articles fail to mention is that in just about all if not all of the states passing these kinds of crackdown on voter fraud, you are still able to vote if you are otherwise qualified but don&rsquo;t have photo ID.  You will simply be given a yellow provisional ballot.  However, those are not conducive to voter fraud, (in spite of the hopes of the proponents of provisional balloting), because in order to count a ballot, your county&rsquo;s Board of Elections is going to follow through to make sure that the person&rsquo;s information on the yellow ballot, age, name, address, etc., is true.  If any element is false, the ballot won&rsquo;t be counted.</p>

		<p>Baloney. There is a very good reason that felons should not be allowed to vote. We don&rsquo;t want them lobbying to abolish laws against criminal acts. Even though their numbers are relatively small, all they need do is join the coalition of the Left just like gays did, and voila!, their influence is magnified.</p>

		<p>Blacks want to make it easier to steal the 2012 election.</p>
<p><i>five have already cut back on voting rights and two more are in discussions about following suit.</i></p>
<p>And I thought the US media were bad!  Since when does preventing voting fraud constitute &#8220;cutting back on voting rights?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>the new measures could bar as many as 5 million eligible voters from taking part in choosing the occupant of the White House next year.</i></p>
<p>NO eligible voters are being prevented from &#8220;taking part in choosing the occupant of the White House next year.&#8221;  Got that Guardian?</p>
<p>What have you to say about blacks intimidating Whites, trying to prevent eligible WHITE voters, some of whom were elderly, from voting in the 2008 election, in violation of United States Federal Law?  That&rsquo;s OK, right?  The American DOJ seem to think it is.</p>
<p>Does voter fraud matter?  Ask Kris Kobach!!   The following is courtesy of VDare.com:</p>
<p><i>Voter fraud is a well-documented reality in American elections. To offer a few examples, a 2010 state representative race in Kansas City, Mo. was stolen when one candidate, J.J. Rizzo, allegedly received more than 50 votes illegally cast by citizens of Somalia. The Somalis, who didn&rsquo;t speak English, were coached to vote for Mr. Rizzo by an interpreter at the polling place. The margin of victory? One vote.</i></p>
<p><i>In Kansas, 221 incidents of voter fraud were reported between 1997 and 2010. The crimes included absentee-ballot fraud, impersonation of another voter, and a host of other violations. Because voter fraud is extremely difficult to detect and is usually not reported, the cases that we know about likely represent a small fraction of the total.</i></p>
<p><i>My office already has found 67 aliens illegally registered to vote in Kansas, but when the total number is calculated, it will likely be in the hundreds. In Colorado, the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office recently identified 11,805 aliens illegally registered to vote in the state, of whom 4,947 cast a ballot in the 2010 elections.</i></p>
<p><i>Evidence of voter fraud is present in all 50 states, and public confidence in the integrity of elections is at an all-time low. In the Cooperative &ldquo;Congressional Election Study of 2008, 62% of American voters thought that voter fraud was very common or somewhat common.</i></p>
<p><i>The Case for Voter ID</i>, By Kris W. Kobach, May 23, 2011</p>
<p>If I were black, I would be highly insulted that the NAACP thought I didn&rsquo;t haven enough intelligence, in the space of an entire year, to procure a photo ID.</p>
<p>How about we have the same voting parameters as Mexico? </p>
<p><i>In Mexico, every registered Mexican voter has a Voter ID card, supplied by the government, complete with photograph, fingerprint, and a holographic image to prevent counterfeiting.</i></p>
<p><i>But it&rsquo;s not just the card. At the Mexican polling station, there is a book containing the photograph of every voter in the precinct. This book is available to the poll workers and observers from various parties. If there&rsquo;s a doubt as to someone&rsquo;s identity, the poll workers can simply look up the person&rsquo;s name and see if the photo matches up.</i></p>
<p><i>The Mexican voter&rsquo;s thumb is smudged with ink. That way, if he shows up at another polling site to vote, they know he&rsquo;s already voted elsewhere. (The ink wears off after a few days.)</i></p>
<p>The NAACP&rsquo;s contention is ridiculous and should be laughed at and mocked as the FRAUD that it is.</p>

		<p>New flash, the TSA requires ID to travel on an airplane.  Perhaps they too are racist. Then again, I don&rsquo;t recall the NAACP complaining about that situation.</p>

		<p>A fraudulent vote negates another&rsquo;s legitimate vote.  Clearly voter ID controls to assure only legitimate voters is a responsible requirement.  Those requirements should be as &#8220;frictionless&#8221; as possible.  And that should be the argument   &mdash;   what are appropriate safeguards   &mdash;   not that there shouldn&rsquo;t be any.</p>

		<p>Asking people to prove who they are prior to voting is a small price to pay to protect the rights we enjoy in this country.  <br>

		<p>Curious that the self-same people the NAACP claims would be harmed by requiring ID, have no problem showing ID to obtain social benefits. </p>

		<p>Voter fraud is epidemic within many inner city precincts in this country. In Philadelphia, they&rsquo;ve actually had instances in which there were more votes cast (for Democrats, of course) than inhabitants of certain precincts.</p>
<p>_______________</p>
<p>In 2004, some of the Philly voting machines were opened up before the polls opened. Surprise! The haughty John Kerry had hundreds of votes already cast for him.<br>

		<p>Yes, because secretly &#8220;the man&#8221; is allowing white inmates to vote.</p>
<p>It is a conspiracy I tell you!</p>

		<p>Immediately after the Civil War, the Southern Democratic Party went after the black vote to maintain control because Lincoln, The Great Emancipator, was a Republican.<br>
Democrats have gone after the minority vote ever since, and with the 1965 Immigration Reform Act have tried to bring minorities into Amerca to maintain that control.<br>
Now they want to allow felons to vote, because NO CONVICT votes Republican.</p>
<p>God Help Us.</p>

		<p>The logic of the NAACP absolutely floors me. So, superficially, they claim to be OK with the concept that if you are arrested and lawfully convicted of a crime, you should be deprived of your liberty and confined until the declared punishment is over.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s OK to take their freedom to move around, but they should be able to vote? If you renounce your right to move freely when you&rsquo;re in jail, how can you have the right to vote?</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t see democracy as being this amazing triumph. I&rsquo;d be OK with a greatly reduced electorate. </p>

		<p>These idiots at the NAACP don&rsquo;t seem to realize that Convicted Felons can&rsquo;t own guns, either. But that never stopped our black and brown residents from obtaining illegal guns and using them in the commission of further criminal activity. What&rsquo;s a little law, anyway? </p>
<p>#23: When the Constitution was adopted, the only people that were permitted to vote were White American men, who had reached the age of 21 years old, and who were land owners. Let&rsquo;s go back to the original intention of the Founders. </p>
