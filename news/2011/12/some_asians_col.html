<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20111203/D9RD6Q9G2.html">Some Asians&rsquo; College Strategy: Don&rsquo;t Check &#8216;Asian&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, My Way, December 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For years, many Asian-Americans have been convinced that it&rsquo;s harder for them to gain admission to the nation&rsquo;s top colleges.</p>
<p>Studies show that Asian-Americans meet these colleges&rsquo; admissions standards far out of proportion to their 6 percent representation in the U.S. population, and that they often need test scores hundreds of points higher than applicants from other ethnic groups to have an equal chance of admission. Critics say these numbers, along with the fact that some top colleges with race-blind admissions have double the Asian percentage of Ivy League schools, prove the existence of discrimination.</p>
<p>The way it works, the critics believe, is that Asian-Americans are evaluated not as individuals, but against the thousands of other ultra-achieving Asians who are stereotyped as boring academic robots.</p>
<p>Now, an unknown number of students are responding to this concern by declining to identify themselves as Asian on their applications.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration from Asian countries was heavily restricted until laws were changed in 1965. When the gates finally opened, many Asian arrivals were well-educated, endured hardships to secure more opportunities for their families, and were determined to seize the American dream through effort and education.</p>
<p>These immigrants, and their descendants, often demanded that children work as hard as humanly possible to achieve. Parental respect is paramount in Asian culture, so many children have obeyed  &mdash;  and excelled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asian students have higher average SAT scores than any other group, including whites. A study by Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade examined applicants to top colleges from 1997, when the maximum SAT score was 1600 (today it&rsquo;s 2400). Espenshade found that Asian-Americans needed a 1550 SAT to have an equal chance of getting into an elite college as white students with a 1410 or black students with an 1100.</p>
<p>Top schools that don&rsquo;t ask about race in admissions process have very high percentages of Asian students. The California Institute of Technology, a private school that chooses not to consider race, is about one-third Asian. (Thirteen percent of California residents have Asian heritage.) The University of California-Berkeley, which is forbidden by state law to consider race in admissions, is more than 40 percent Asian  &mdash;  up from about 20 percent before the law was passed.</p>

		<p>Asians in our America are waging a very aggressive race-replacement war against the Native Born White American Majority. They are also a mighty serious threat to America&rsquo;s endangered species and ecosystems. They do not belong in our America.</p>
<p>There are no economic,cultural,demographic and ecological reasons for 1)having repealed the the wonderfull &#8220;Chinese Exclusion Act&#8221; and 2)importing any Asians at all into our America.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White Americans manage to survive without the presence of millions of high fertility Asians in our America? Very well thank you..Native Born White Americans managed to put 12 alpha Native Born White American Males on the moon&hellip;this apparently bothers the Asians in our America.</p>
<p>Asians in our America have set into motion the ecological destabilization of the state of Virginia&rsquo; riparian ecosytems. I don&rsquo;t care if they are being discriminated against at Ivy league schools.</p>

		<p>Everyone knows Asians and whites get kicked in the teeth at admission time. For three decades now this has been the case. Too, the 140 point gap between whites and Asians at elite schools may reflect, in part, the affect of legacies and jocks on the white SAT average. A few bad apples&hellip; </p>

<p>Stereotyped? Okay, why are Asians stereotyped as &#8220;smart&#8221; while blacks are supposedly unfairly stereotyped as unintelligent? Hmm? Could it possibly be that Asians DO perform far better academically than blacks?</p>
<p>Okay, then the question becomes WHY? The libs will claim that it has nothing to do with native ability, that it&rsquo;s solely the product of &#8220;culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, if we could only figure out how to change black &#8220;culture,&#8221; we&rsquo;d have the whole problem licked! Too bad it hasn&rsquo;t been done anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>A lot of these people are truly screwed up. Blacks blame whites for their educational failures, many NE Asian (men, primarily) blame whites for their sexual failures.</p>
<p>Both are obsessed with white women. And of course the multiculti left takes their side. </p>
<p>Re-think your alliances and be careful when choosing an Asian partner. Women tend to assimilate very quickly, if you have a daughter, but a son can go either way. There&rsquo;s quite a few self-hating half white/half asian men out there who attack their European ancestry. </p>

<p>My gut feeling tells me you are an Asianphile who has no problems with Asians being in America. Am I correct about this? Even if affirmative action was terminated next week, they would still be an illegitimate presence in our America..they would still be waging a war of race-replacement against the Native Born White American majority.</p>

<p>Your post provides strong evidence for my suspicion-and the suspicion of Anon 5:35-that there is an underlying Asianphilia among some &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221;. Racial Origins do matter. It is not alright to have Asians in American University systems where they will be trained and encouraged to wage a vicious race war against Native Born White Americans. Some &#8220;White Nationalists&#8221; and quite a few members of the HBD movement such as Steve Sailer are obvious Asianphiles who want to link the fate of Native Born White Americans with the Asian invaders. I will have none of this.</p>
<p>Mangan has a dicussion about this news story over at his website..a quite excellent discussion. Pay attention to Scottsman&rsquo;s comments..very similar to mine&hellip;Svigor has excellent comments also&hellip;go have a look. Some of us in the Native Born White American Patriot Movement are on to the rampant Asianphilia in the HBD movement.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I mentioned it before but:The Chinese Exclusion Act was a wonderfull piece of 19th legislation..we can thank an American Jew an Socialist for its passage..Thank you Samuel Gompers. If the Chinese Exclusion Act had not been repealed, there wouldn&rsquo;t be millions of Asians in our America today complaining that they are being shut out of elite American Universities where they could be waging a vicious race war against the minority Native Born White American teenager population on these elite college and universitie campuses. It was an Asian &#8220;American&#8221; UCSD student president who organized a racial &#8220;witch&#8221; hunt against the minority Native Born White American Male student population on the UCSD campus.</p>

		<p>Zero sympathy for them.  Asians have never cared about discrimination against whites; we would be fools to help them in any way.  This idea that we can make alliances with Asians is a ridiculous pipe dream. Not one person who thinks being pro-white is &#8220;racist&#8221; has been persuaded otherwise by this tactic.  <br>

<p>In the VAST majority (all?) cases of East Asian immigration, they have lower fertility rates than native populations. America, Malaysia, India, Africa, the Middle East, you name it. Excessive, hostile fecundity is not part of their culture. They only breed above replacement in their homelands, and sadly these days not even then.</p>
<p>They grow in number because of immigration. But, they&rsquo;re just playing by the rules in the end.</p>

		<p>Are you ready for the truth? There are in China alive this instant more human beings with IQs over 140 than we have with IQs over 120 and India has even more! The Average Chineeze kid at 18 has a better abilty to read and write English than an American high School graduate. More people speak English in India than in the rest of the world combined. They will be the masters of your grand children`s children and there is not a thing you are going to do about it. Western man conquered and exploited both civilizations and deep down they want pay back. The English went to war to force the Chineeze to import opium. I envision a time where China takes over the cocaine trade and uses it to bleed us dry. Get ready for living in a mass ant farm as your progeny becomes coolies for their Chineeze mental superiors. They just might end up eating us for food.<br>

		<p>To all the Asian AmRenners out there, I speak fluent Ebonics and am a good language instructor.  The utter perversion of the English language by black Africans is not difficult to achieve.  With roughly six weeks of instruction I can have you speaking ghetto jive like the most ignorant inner-city dweller.</p>
<p>Personal interviews with admissions personnel can be mastered as well. Get a good tan before starting the process, wear sunglasses to hide your eyes, and get a slightly oversize baseball cap and wear it sideways to conceal your straight hair.  Alternatively, slather your hair with Georgia Peach Pomade, comb it flat, and your disguise is foolproof. </p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll have to change your name to complete the transformation.  Don&rsquo;t choose Leroy - it&rsquo;s too obvious.  Any normal Anglo first name will do after proper Africanization.  Be sure to simply misspell it stylishly.  </p>
<p>Good luck with your new identity.</p>

<p>If you want to live among the Chinese, pack up and go live in China..don&rsquo;t impose China on the rest of us. The Asians in our America are actively participating in the destruction of who knows how many centuries of Native Born White American engineering,scientific,medical and technical experience-future generations of Native Born White American included. This is in the realm of genocide.</p>

		<p>Asian&rsquo;s may be getting the shaft but you can bet they say it in ways that make it clear they are lining up behind the hate-the-west-first grievance factories and in solidarity with every other victim-group in the US. Anything else, or any other stance might be, backwardly enough, &#8216;hate&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>#28  &mdash;  correct. Why won&rsquo;t everyone just check &#8220;Black&#8221; or &#8220;Latino&#8221; (or is it Hispanic?) on any form that asks for this information? If called out on it, simply state that race, clearly being a social construct  &mdash;  and so the applicant simply considers him or herself to be black or Latino. Q.E.D. Who is the admissions board to question this?</p>

<p>&#8220;Re-think your alliances and be careful when choosing an Asian partner. Women tend to assimilate very quickly, if you have a daughter, but a son can go either way. There&rsquo;s quite a few self-hating half white/half asian men out there who attack their European ancestry.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree except I believe half white/asian females are just as likely to deny their white side and mix/mingle/breed with Asians.  This is especially true in California in neighborhoods completely taken over by Asians.  A lot of times you see Asian looking females with Anglo last names who have completely immersed themselves with the immediate majority to the point it becomes hard to tell their beta white dads even existed. </p>
<p>This is what I keep stressing.  Breeding with Asians (male or female) not only dilutes your white pool gene&hellip;. you run the risk of eventually breeding out the white COMPLETELY. </p>

		<p>I went to a State University back in &rsquo;90s and claimed &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;african american&#8221; on everything. I had a seperate P.O. Box to get the mail- you&rsquo;d be surprised at all the stuff you get. The worst that can happen if you get caught is that you just explain that you accidentally checked the wrong box. </p>

<p>My gut feeling tells me you are an Asianphile who has no problems with Asians being in America. Am I correct about this? Even if affirmative action was terminated next week, they would still be an illegitimate presence in our America..they would still be waging a war of race-replacement against the Native Born White American majority.<br>

I am an &#8220;Asianphile.&#8221; I have &#8220;no problems with Asians being in America.&#8221; The only Americans who have the right to complain about the presence of Asians in America are American Indians. With the Fourteenth Amendment the U.S. Constitution is explicitly race neutral. Asians in the United States earn their success academically and economically by hard work and superior intelligence.<br>
 <br>
Don&rsquo;t take my word for it. This is what Professor J. Philippe Rushton, who has spoken at American Renaissance conferences has to say about it: &#8220;On average, Orientals are slower to mature, less fertile, less sexually active, less aggressive, and have larger brains and higher IQ scores.<br>

What part of &#8220;higher IQ scores&#8221; don&rsquo;t you understand, Jupiter7? </p>

		<p>Jupiter, one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about many Asians, beside the fact that they do often apply themselves academically, and are good students in general, is their pracitical attitude. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many I often saw cheating on tests when I was in college. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother them at all. One Asian girl,very popular and pleasant,(I can&rsquo;t recall her name) during a chemistry test, started looking at her book, that she had on her lap, and the teacher noticed it right away. He told her nicely with a smile, to put the book away. She laughed at being caught, but what blew me away was, that even after he told her, she continued to look at it while he again told her more emphatically, to put it away. It was interesting that she had so little conscience about cheating, but seemed to just consider it funny getting caught. It amazed me.  </p>

<p>Well, after that comment, you didn&rsquo;t really need to elaborate any further, it&rsquo; the standard argument given by the radical left, and every illegal alien, from every place in the world. There really ARE NO AMERICANS, in the sense that Americans mean the people that largely created this nation. </p>

		<p>#29 Charles Tiffany, right you are about Chinese. But I,have a different view. I&rsquo;m simply not convinced about the I.Q. thing. I never was. There are so many cases where people deemed to be utter idiots when they were young, turned out to be a big surprise for everyone when they accomplished amazing things. I believe environment and application weigh for more heavily, especially with white American kids, then I.Q. does. Look at most of them. They are intellectually lazy, don&rsquo;t give a rats tail about books, and are preoccupied with every inanity one can imagine. Endless video software games, sporting events, horsing around, everything in fact, but their studies. They often pass classes by cramming and end up with a C. I&rsquo;d love to know, what the result would be if these white American kids were actually passionate about a subject and put in the hours that Asian kids do. I worked for a Chinese guy, Tony, and he described to me his love, that&rsquo;s right, Love,of physical Chemistry. How many white kids go around talking about their love of physical chemistry or some such technical topic? They don&rsquo;t have the time, with all the nonsense they are constantly occupied with.</p>

		<p>Re John Engleman,you are either an idiot or an anti-white ne&rsquo;er do well. How dare you say the Asians should be welcomed here! Its not THEIR country, it is OURS. We didn&rsquo;t work generation after generation to create a nation  &mdash;  one that is somehow, I guess by sheer luck, or maybe Magic Gamma Rays from God beaming down on us?  &mdash;  far far superior to any created by the Chinese. You seem to be quite ignorant of the people you love so well. You have no idea of the corruption,the cruelty, the viciousness of the Chinese? So, many of them are intelligent. Lets have a parade!!  Only a brainless fool would feel that way. </p>

		<p>Funny how all these super high-IQed Asians don&rsquo;t seem to be very smart at founding, financing, and attending their own schools.  Maybe somebody should do a study to figure out this odd phenomenon.</p>
<p>Computers are super-duper high IQed too, but they do need to be programmed&hellip;as do the Asians.</p>

		<p>I find it very interesting that on the websites-blogs of elite mathematicians and physicists and on pysics forums that every time a IQ test score enthusiast pops up in the comments section and raises the issue of IQ score and success as a mathematics and physics researcher, the mathematicians and physicists who post on these websites-blogs laugh the IQ score enthusiasts off&hellip;it is just not taken seriously by a vast majority of research mathematicians and physcists. I gave a few examples of this in a post I made over at Alternative Right two months ago. Raise the IQ tests score issue and you will with 100 percent certainty sidetrack a &#8220;debate&#8221; about race-replacement with a mind numbing-eyes glaze over-mind numbing discussion about the psychometrics of IQ tests..it will happen every time.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;You have no idea of the corruption,the cruelty, the viciousness of the Chinese?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Yes. You are right. That is why they commit crimes about 1/4 the white rate, are less &#8216;psychopathic&rsquo; according to a previous Amren article, and commit virtually zero sex crimes.</p>
<p>As for corruption China&rsquo;s is more or less typical for a developing nation. China is a lot less corrupt than Russia, and about as corrupt as Italy and Greece (refer corruption survey 2011 - google it).</p>
<p>Singapore is a Chinese polity and is one of the least corrupt places in the world.</p>

		<p>The parts of the article that were &#8220;snipped&#8221; out are pretty crucial, it is important to not that Asians with names like Ching Fung can&rsquo;t use this strategy. Every single one of the girls in the article had a last name like Johnson.</p>

		<p>#44 - Wayne - Well Singapore is basically the world&rsquo;s biggest nanny state, with the mafioso-like Lee family in charge. Sure corruption might not be as visible on the surface, but I think the Lee family&rsquo;s wealth and corruption is massively under reported by the western media. And putting China&rsquo;s corruption down to it being a developing nation is to turn a blind eye to the country&rsquo;s history. It goes back thousands of years, and part of the reason it was so easily occupied by foreign powers is because it was so internally corrupt. And while yes, today there are many countries that are corrupt, few are as rotten to the core as China. Part of the reason China will never rule the world. They simply do not have a developed culture.</p>
<p>Japan is about the only country in that region I truly respect, and even they had help from the west. Look up W. Edwards Deming, a westerner who had a massive impact on Japanese industry. No coincidence that one of Japan&rsquo;s leading industry awards is named after him.</p>
