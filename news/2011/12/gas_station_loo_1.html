			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>My Fox Philly, December 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The owner of a North Philadelphia gas station who traveled out of the country for his mother&rsquo;s funeral will come back to find his business destroyed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Left behind is the aftermath of an all-out free-for-all.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, someone broke into a mini-mart on Cumberland Street and Germantown Avenue when word got around that the owner left town.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before the looting started. Soon, the whole store was in shambles. </p>
<p>The inside of the store is ruined. The only products left are a bottle of vinegar and some oatmeal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But every shelf had been picked clean. The floors were mess. Everything in the refrigerators was gone. And kids told O&rsquo;Connell they broke into the ATM and got $600 dollars from it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Finally, a friend of the owner showed up. He told us the owner left on a last-minute trip to India  &mdash;  after his mother died.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be ashamed of their selves, just doing that. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. This is the neighborhood. This is what they do,&#8221; one witness said.</p>

		<p>     The Indian owner, I&rsquo;m sure, received a SBA loan to buy that store. If you are white just try getting a SBA loan.No dice gringo.There were 13 motels in Winslow Ariz.12 were owned by you know who. The one white owned motel decided to advertise &#8216;American owned&rsquo;. Well the NY Times was all over that story. However, the Comisseriat of correct/think must have been asleep that day. In the article they actually quoted the white guy saying that the Indians all got Govt help in buying their businesses, while he had to use his own dough. I had to laugh&hellip; before I cried.</p>

		<p>Where were the cops? Why didn`t at least 1 neighbor call them? I refuse to believe that things have gotten so bad that there are no decent black folk left in North Philly. In Kissimmee, blacks call the cops all the time to stop looters and thugs. Of course we do not have the No Snitch Law on the books. He will leave and never be seen in the hood again. The next Punjabi or Bangladeshi who moves in will increase his prices by about 25%. The old folks will have to stretch their Social security check  a little more.Have any arrests been made? Why wasn`t this on the nightly news? [ rhetorical question ]?<br>

		<p>Quite frankly I do not care what happens to them.  They are not Americans.  They never will be.  I know what an American looked like because I see one in the mirror every morning.  It isn&rsquo;t my fight.  Let them battle each other.</p>
<p>Unlike many Amren readers I do not support the Asian take over of America nor do I worship them.  I am sick of the phrase &#8220;white and Asian&#8221;.  I want them to go home.  I do not care how smart or polite they seem.  They are an invasive people.</p>

<p>Correct. No doubt the district will soon be labelled a &#8220;food desert&#8221; which is &#8220;underserved.&#8221; And white-owned businesses will be compelled by government diktat to open premises there with subsidised prices.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fraud involved in getting  one of those starting a business in America visas. The prospective business owner has to show a bank statement that he has $40,000.  The money only has to be in the bank for one day, just long enough to appear on the statement.</p>
<p>An entire clan will chip in for the $40,000.  They will also borrow high interest short term loans to get the money in the bank.</p>
<p>Then they go to the American consulate and get their visa with no question.  The people who approve the visas are not American state department employees.  They are locals who often take bribes and or favor their relatives and clan members.</p>
<p>They also must show that the business will employ Americans.</p>
<p>They never do.  They will pay a smuggler $30,000 to bring in a relative but will never hire an American. <br>

		<p>I think everyone around the world acknowledges blacks are much more likely to steal from you than anyone else.  Everywhere the blacks go the place becomes impoverished almost overnight.  And then the liberal airheads on the news are SURPRISED when African-Americans start acting like Africans.</p>

		<p>I could swear I read an article on Amren some years back that started out something like, &#8220;Have you ever wondered why all the convenience store owners are named Patel? &#8221; It was about the SBA scam, but I&rsquo;ve never never been able to find it again. Does anyone, or Amren, know about it?  </p>
<p>Anyway, a few observations.</p>
<p>1) In the historic town a few miles away from where I live an old historic building from the 1800&rsquo;s houses a Mexican restaurant. According to the person in charge of renting out the commercial property in that area, they were the only ones who could get funding. </p>
<p>2) We opened a store in that same town and across the parking lot there was a Chinese restaurant. We rarely saw even two cars parked in front of that restaurant for the whole day. What was going on? How did they stay in business? </p>
<p>3) My first vist to New Orleans on business was around 1994. Most of the owners of the tourist shops that sold beads, music, coffee, etc., were native Whites or Blacks. When I went back again about a year or two before Katrina, they were all Muslims or Arabs or whatever. Barely an American to be seen. What the <br>
hell happened?</p>
<p>4) I had a conversation with someone from that volunteer group of retired businessmen that supports the SBA. He said I needed a business plan and I asked him how was it was that people who don&rsquo;t speak English can write a business plan. He finally admitted that there were &#8220;non-profit support groups&#8221; that write them for them. </p>
<p>So, no I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for the &#8220;Patels.&#8221; They need to go home and take all their relatives with them.    </p>

		<p>I have no sympathy for this man, because I have seen how the &#8220;Patels&#8221; have taken over every hotel in my local area. And some of them do take advantage of the local community too. Worse the Mestizo invaders have set up their own businesses on the backs of white taxpayers through those fraudulent SBA loans. We are seeing here just a very small example what is in store for the world if all whites globally simply vanished. What the blacks did was criminal behavior I come to expect of them, but I also feel schadenfreude towards the store owner because he is symptomatic of the ongoing and increasing dispossession and oppression of whites ahead of the massive genocide the non-white rulers of the nation and indeed the world are planning for us. One thing does have to be kept in mind, they would have looted that store at the first opportunity no matter who had owned it. However, had the owner been white, they would have also looted his home too if they could have. The moral of the story here for whites is to never leave your home or business unguarded while letting slip that you will be out of town around these criminals and thieves.</p>

		<p>I agree on the Patel issue.  I have personally stayed at motels where the name was the same.  The situation bears resemblance to the Korean grocers in Black neighborhoods across the nation some 20 years ago.  It was were Korean immigrants got their start-and soon moved up and away. During that time there was public knowledge of the residents in the &#8220;hood&#8221; continually attempting to steal or rob these groceries.  Koreans are tough people, however, and weathered this permanent assault long enough to fund their way out.</p>
<p>Of course, Black &#8220;leaders&#8221; have for decades attempted to cast blame and aspersions on businesses who are too averse to opening a premises in the ghetto.  The ones that do, we can safely assume, risk their lives every day, and their profit margin has to be slim, compared to a suburban location. </p>
<p>Where I lived in Tampa, FL, a refugee Vietnamese family had a convenience store that was held up by 3 Black youths. The father was shot point blank in the head in front of his family.  The perp, during the arraignment, trial, and sentencing gave the impression that his crime was a speed bump on the road of life.</p>
<p>His sentence? A life term, given by a Liberal, Reformed Jewish Progressive, who sited his &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; background. The disbelief and hurt of this family is seared in my memory. And by the way, Vincent, the father, used to advance credit to some of the families and gave small things away to some of the children.  They were Christians, you see.</p>

		<p>21, 23 et al:</p>
<p>The most common way Patel types (and other Asian types with other kinds of businesses) run scams with hotels, motels, etc. is that one Patel gets an SBA loan to buy a motel from its current owner.  Then another Patel gets a bigger SBA loan to buy it from the first Patel.  Various Patels keep getting bigger and bigger SBA loans to buy the same motel from each other, until at some point the SBA will deny a Patel a loan for amount &#8220;that&#8221; big, and the Patel who took out the biggest loan is left holding the bag.  He&rsquo;ll declare bankruptcy, but then he is living with all his other Patel relatives who reaped the Ponzi scheme profits.</p>
<p>There is another kind of scam that&rsquo;s more sophisticated and convoluted.  I can&rsquo;t remember its details though, but it involves private bank loans.</p>
<p>I take this Patel business seriously because I lost the last job I had, being the general manager of a nice big chain of gas stations for a family concern, when the family decided to sell all his stations to some Patel that (I suspect) waved a big enough SBA-provided cash in his face.</p>

Let us not forget that you cannot touch a kid under 18 or else junior&rsquo;s parents will file a lawsuit against you. Every time the cops try to control race rioters, they get called brutal.</p>

Actually, I would say that the three important things that matter in property are neighbors, neighbors, neighbors. <br>
 <br>
One of the most prestigious neighborhoods in the United States is Georgetown in Washington, DC.<br>
 <br>
The architecture in Georgetown is virtually identical to the architecture in parts of North East and South East Washington. It consists primarily of town houses and row houses built in the nineteenth century. <br>
 <br>
The difference between these neighborhoods is the neighbors: high IQ whites live in Georgetown; low IQ blacks live in North East and South East Washington. Consequently, Georgetown is a safe neighborhood with a vibrant night life. The only time it is dangerous is when large numbers of blacks converge on it. <br>
 <br>
North East and South East Washington, DC are asphalt jungles. The beauty of the buildings is marred by the sound of gunfire and police sirens.   </p>

<p>&#8220;I could swear I read an article on Amren some years back that started out something like, &ldquo;Have you ever wondered why all the convenience store owners are named Patel? &rdquo; It was about the SBA scam, but I&rsquo;ve never never been able to find it again. Does anyone, or Amren, know about it?</p>
<p>Anyway, a few observations.</p>
<p>1) In the historic town a few miles away from where I live an old historic building from the 1800&rsquo;s houses a Mexican restaurant. According to the person in charge of renting out the commercial property in that area, they were the only ones who could get funding.</p>
<p>2) We opened a store in that same town and across the parking lot there was a Chinese restaurant. We rarely saw even two cars parked in front of that restaurant for the whole day. What was going on? How did they stay in business?</p>
<p>3) My first vist to New Orleans on business was around 1994. Most of the owners of the tourist shops that sold beads, music, coffee, etc., were native Whites or Blacks. When I went back again about a year or two before Katrina, they were all Muslims or Arabs or whatever. Barely an American to be seen. What the<br>
hell happened?</p>
<p>4) I had a conversation with someone from that volunteer group of retired businessmen that supports the SBA. He said I needed a business plan and I asked him how was it was that people who don&rsquo;t speak English can write a business plan. He finally admitted that there were &ldquo;non-profit support groups&rdquo; that write them for them.</p>
<p>So, no I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for the &ldquo;Patels.&rdquo; They need to go home and take all their relatives with them. &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt; I have heard that many Mexican restaurants are laundering drug money.  I read that the cartels either take them over or actually get their own to open them.  There must be thousands involved because the laundering would have to be dispersed widely so as to not attract attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indian owner, I&rsquo;m sure, received a SBA loan to buy that store. If you are white just try getting a SBA loan.No dice gringo.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to get one as a young professional in 1983.  I was told it was unlikely since I was white and male.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite frankly I do not care what happens to them. They are not Americans. They never will be. I know what an American looked like because I see one in the mirror every morning. It isn&rsquo;t my fight. Let them battle each other.</p>
<p>Unlike many Amren readers I do not support the Asian take over of America nor do I worship them. I am sick of the phrase &ldquo;white and Asian&rdquo;. I want them to go home. I do not care how smart or polite they seem. They are an invasive people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Interesting to note that even Louisiana has an Indian governor now.  I don&rsquo;t know if he is Muslim or what?</p>
<p>This is a fascinating question.  When one adds it up with the other issues like H1B Visas and the program of giving immigrants easy access to SBA loans and the fraudulent way the system is allowed to be worked, one has to think that there is a conspiracy, and not a new one - being worked.  By studying the history of New Orleans where you say so many were replaced, some pattern might be found.  There must be some agency pointing them to real estate and agents who come to business owners with plans to buy them out.  It sounds like an old Western style melodrama with a villain that forces sales on weaker people.  But if this is a government operation, then we&rsquo;d like to know which it is, wouldn&rsquo;t we folks?</p>

		<p>Not even the poorest, down-on-their-luck whites would do this. They&rsquo;d rather get a second job or sell stuff of theirs or grow their own vegetables and hunt than engage in this debauchery. Poverty doesn&rsquo;t create crime.  That&rsquo;s politically correct nonsense.  Why didn&rsquo;t the majority of whites in the Depression go out and loot and steal and rape and pillage and kill others?  Even the poor whites from Oklahoma who headed for California when the Dust Bowl hit Oklahoma and they lived in tents weren&rsquo;t harming others there.  In the old days, blacks didn&rsquo;t do the stuff in this video (at least not to whites) because they knew damn well a white lynch mob would be storming through their neighborhoods.  Blacks aren&rsquo;t held accountable for their bad behavior and they aren&rsquo;t punished for it.  That&rsquo;s why their &#8216;youth&rsquo; does this.</p>

<p><b>Owner Returns To Looted Store</b><br>
Updated: Sunday, 18 Dec 2011, 12:53 PM EST<br>
Published : Saturday, 17 Dec 2011, 9:25 PM EST</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA - A North Philadelphia shop owner said he had no words to describe his emotions upon returning from India, where he had attended his mother&rsquo;s funeral, to discover his store had been looted and vandalized.</p>
<p>Bhupinder Cheema had operated a small convenience store near Germantown Avenue and West Cumberland Street, and had invested thousands of dollars into the business. Over the course of trip to Indian, which lasted several weeks, word spread through the neighborhood that the store had been left unattended.</p>
<p>Police had responded to the store once a window had been found to have been broken, however they were unsuccessful in preventing the store from being ransacked.</p>
<p>In addition to losing his business and mother, Cheema said his father had died several months ago and his wife is battling a brain tumor.</p>
