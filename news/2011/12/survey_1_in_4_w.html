<h1><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-survey-women-victims-severe-violence.html">Survey: 1 in 4 Women Attacked by Intimate Partner</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Medical Xpress, December 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s a startling number: 1 in 4 women surveyed by the government say they were violently attacked by their husbands or boyfriends.<br>
Experts in domestic violence don&rsquo;t find it too surprising, although some aspects of the survey may have led to higher numbers than are sometimes reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s the first time we&rsquo;ve had this kind of estimate&#8221; on the prevalence of intimate partner violence, said Linda Degutis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The survey, released by the CDC Wednesday, marks the beginning of a new annual project to look at how many women say they&rsquo;ve been abused.</p>
<p>One expert called the new report&rsquo;s estimate on rape and attempted rape &#8220;extremely high&#8221;  &mdash;  with 1 in 5 women saying they were victims. About half of those cases involved intimate partners. No documentation was sought to verify the women&rsquo;s claims, which were made anonymously.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CDC report is based on a randomized telephone survey of about 9,000 women and 7,400 men.</p>
<p>Among the findings:</p>
<p>- As many as 29 million women say they have suffered severe and frightening physical violence from a boyfriend, spouse or other intimate partner. That includes being choked, beaten, stabbed, shot, punched, slammed against something or hurt by hair-pulling.</p>
<p>- That number grows to 36 million if slapping, pushing and shoving are counted.</p>
<p>- Almost half of the women who reported rape or attempted rape said it happened when they were 17 or younger.</p>
<p>-As many as 1 in 3 women have experienced rape, physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetimes, compared to about 1 in 10 men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several of the CDC numbers are higher than those of other sources. For example, the CDC study suggests that 1.3 million women have suffered rape, attempted rape or had sex forced on them in the previous year. That statistic is more than seven times greater than what was reported by a Department of Justice household survey conducted last year.</p>
<p>The CDC rape numbers seem &#8220;extremely high,&#8221; but there may be several reasons for the differences, including how the surveys were done, who chose to participate and how &#8220;rape&#8221; and other types of assault were defined or interpreted, said Shannan Catalano, a statistician with the Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p>

		<p>Below is a very alarming article about domestic violence and race.</p>
<p><br>
Gender – Not Race – is Biggest Factor in Violent Behavior<br>
 <br>
Since The Grand Rapids Press featured an article on black men killing black men, people have weighed in with their analyses of the problem. They&rsquo;ve presented a myriad of causes such as poor education, poverty, ineffective parenting, racism, etc., but the most common denominator, male socialization, isn&rsquo;t discussed.</p>
<p>Gender socialization is the process in which young people learn how they are supposed to think, feel, and behave as men and women. There are many causative variables discussed in the analysis of violent criminal behavior, but the one that remains invisible is the toxicity of male socialization.</p>
<p>Men commit most homicides</p>
<p>The fact is that men, not women, across all socio-economic levels, races, families, and cultures are the primary perpetrators of violent crime. This illuminates the power of gender socialization. If poor education was the primary cause of black criminal behavior, then why are most of our homicides committed by men?</p>
<p>If poverty is the primary cause of violent black criminal behavior then why don&rsquo;t we have as many females in prison as men? If a dysfunctional family with ineffective parenting, abuse and neglect is the primary cause then why do men account for 90 percent of the domestic violence offender population? If racism is the primary impetus for black male criminal behavior, then why are white males committing violent crime at about the same male to female ratio as their black counterparts?</p>
<p>If &ldquo;kids are killing kids&rdquo; in the school shootings then why have all of the shooters been male students? In addition, most of these boys were also white students in intact families attending good suburban schools. Male socialization is the missing link in the analyses of black male violent crime and violent crime in general.</p>
<p>Boys aren&rsquo;t born brutes or beasts genetically programmed to be violent. Rigid male socialization is a social toxin to men&rsquo;s humanity and the most vulnerable in our society will manifest symptoms of the toxin.</p>
<p>Think about air pollution. Air pollution is a physical toxin to asthmatic patients. These patients become symptomatic, manifesting complications in breathing when in polluted climates.</p>
<p>Individuals raised in environments with racism, poverty, dysfunctional families, unemployment, and poor education end up psychologically asthmatic, vulnerable to social toxins such as male socialization. These boys feel vulnerable, powerless, and marginalized. However, the male code tells them to &ldquo;tough it out,&rdquo; &ldquo;suck it up,&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toughness equated to manliness</p>
<p>Manliness is equated with being tough, strong, aggressive, powerful, and always in control. Boys get called names such as weak, wuss, or sissy when they behave outside the masculine box. They get disrespected and ostracized. The pressure to fit in is huge. The result is that boys squash their humanity.</p>
<p>Men look for ways to prop themselves up to appear more powerful, more intimidating, more competitive, essentially, more manly. Affluent white boys may be able to do this with money, cars, houses, degrees, and social status, while those less fortunate may be left to prove their masculinity with violence, guns and even murder.</p>
<p>In effect, the male socialization process teaches men to externalize painful emotions and avoid states of vulnerability. Consequently, some men act out their rage and pain onto others in acts of criminal violence. After all, to kill someone is the ultimate act of control and power.</p>
<p>We also don&rsquo;t talk about the broader impact of male training on our boys. It is frightening to see how poorly our boys are adapting and fitting into society. Not only are they more violent, but also they are less likely than girls to go to college, more likely to drop out of high school or be placed in special education, and twice as likely than girls to die in a car accident.</p>
<p>We need to continue working to improve education, unemployment, parenting, and racism. We also need to raise our boys to be more fit, more humane. If we give them permission to talk, feel, and emotionally connect to others they are less likely to loose their souls in oppressive conditions. The enemies of violence are empathy, compassion, sensitivity and humility; so let&rsquo;s encourage this in boys too.</p>
<p>We need to stop leaving the issue of male socialization out of our discussions on violent behavior. And, let&rsquo;s work on socializing our boys to stay in touch with their humanity. Then, and only then, do boys have a chance to refrain from violent behavior in difficult circumstances and a challenging world.</p>

		<p>I was watching televsion last month and there were two authors, Nancy Crowell, the co-author of the book &#8220;Understanding Violence Against Women,&#8221; and Margaret Yorke, author of &#8220;Dangerous To Know,&#8221; who spoke passiaontely and convicningly about the level of violence toward women that is frequently unreported.</p>
<p>Moreover, both women argued that the vast majority of men who commit domestic violence are White. Like 62% accroding to these women.  </p>
<p>This was shocking to me.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t surprising. My hypothesis as to why Amerindians and multi-racials are more engaged in domestic violence than Blacks: Amerindians are more prone to alcoholism (genetics) and depression (environmental), which leads to aggression. And biracial people are much more likely to be depressed, and, in men, that depression leads to and/or is expressed through aggression. I just wonder if, during the explanation stage of the research, they concluded that racial differences in temperament *might* at least be a possible factor.</p>
<p>The gap in violent behavior between Whites and Asians is startling; a full standard deviation. r/K selection is magnificent.</p>

<p>The stats above were based on race.  Men do more violence than women.  That always was and always will be true.  The stats were based on race.  I think multiracial above means White/Black and the White part is almost always the woman, so it&rsquo;s Black men doing most of the violence.  Why are you trying to divert attention from that?</p>

		<p>You have to remember the chart is showing the race of the women (victims) not the men. Many multi-racial women end up with black men&hellip;&hellip;.one drop rule and black men prefer lighter skin.  </p>

		<p>In answer to everyone&rsquo;s query about why blacks rank lower than multiracials in terms of domestic violence, the answer is simple: You have to remain in a woman&rsquo;s life in order to beat her. Black men desert their women so quickly that they don&rsquo;t even leave themselves with time to domestically abuse them (although knocking a girl up and then abandoning her is a form of abuse).</p>

		<p>I kind of agree with the &#8216;it&rsquo;s gender, not race&rsquo; idea, however&hellip; while men are many times more likely to murder, when it comes to murder of a spouse, the difference is not so large. Only a few decades ago the percentages were pretty close. What of women who murder or have it arranged so their husbands are murdered? It might also be asked, what of the whites who murder across the color line?</p>

		<p>Just a thought, but I wonder how much of this is the fault of the feminist movement. Yes, I agree that men commit more violent crimes than women and there are some men that are incorrigible creeps, but at one time women were supposed to have a role in civilizing men. The men were the warriors, but the women made sure they took their dirty boots off before they entered the house. The feminists are almost as bad as the men, sex with whoever and whenever they want it, children out of wedlock (because who needs a man?), career over family, and the list goes on. If men don&rsquo;t respect women anymore, can we blame them? We brought this upon ourselves.  When I look back upon my &#8220;feminist&#8221; years, I cringe with shame.</p>
<p>As I say, just a thought.  </p>

		<p>Beware stats on DV, this is the only violent crime where women equal men as perps, and feminists desperately want to hide that fact. They own the industry, and feel free to tinker with the truth as they see fit. Malicious definitions of &#8220;sexual&#8221; and &#8220;violent&#8221; abound in their &#8220;studies&#8221;.</p>
<p>The race patterns are only mildly surprising. Amerindians are awful sots (a good proxy for violence), and anyone who dates outside their race engages in a sexual treason guaranteed to attract predators. Also, Asians and Pacific Islanders ought be separate as their crime rates differ greatly.</p>

<p>As for the Indians, I&rsquo;m not really surprised. A few years ago, I interviewed for a job in Billings, Montana. One of the locals told me about the &#8220;Drunk bus&#8221; that the police use to round up passed out Crow Indians around the city. They are then carted off to the drunk tank and the reservation (30 miles down the road) is notified. Activity tends to be the highest around government paydays.   </p>

		<p>These surveys must be read with caution.  Like most other government sponsored studies, it is likely simply a tool to gain further control over citizens, and extract more tax dollars.</p>
<p>The study methodology consisted of random phone calls.  As the author&rsquo;s state:  </p>
<p><i>The findings of this report are subject to a number of limitations. Random digit dial telephone surveys face [a major issue] that [has] the potential to affect the representativeness of the sample population.</i></p>
<p>thus we read:</p>
<p><i>The cell-phone only population tends to be young, low income, and comprised of racial/ethnic minorities (Peytchev, Carley-Baxter, &amp; Black, 2011). Importantly, these demographic groups have higher prevalence of sexual violence, stalking, and intimate partner violence.</i></p>
<p>Also included under the rubric of &#8220;violence&#8221; is the very subjective &#8220;psychological&#8221; variety:</p>
<p><i>Nearly half of all women in the United States (48.4% or approximately 57.6 million) have experienced at least one form of psychological aggression by an intimate partner during their lifetime, with 4 in 10 (40.3%) reporting some form of expressive aggression: their partner acted angry in a way that seemed dangerous, told them they were a loser or a failure, insulted or humiliated them)&hellip;</i></p>
<p>This is not to downplay the aggression inherent in minority populations.  I once knew a psychiatrist who, after years of dealing with abused women, concluded rather cynically that black men beating up their women was just a form of &#8220;foreplay.&#8221;</p>
<p>A companion document from CDC can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="/NCIPC/pub-res/images/IPVandSVscreening.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.cdc.gov/NCIPC/pub-res/images/IPVandSVscreening.pdf</a></p>
<p>It is worth viewing the document&rsquo;s cover clip art (I&rsquo;m sure these are not real clinicians): an &#8220;understanding&#8221; male black physician who is there &#8220;to help,&#8221; a compassionate Asian nurse(not sure her nationality  &mdash;  doesn&rsquo;t look Chinese, Vietnamese or Japanese), and a very angry looking white woman nurse.  I guess the implication is that it&rsquo;s the absent white man who is the problem.</p>

		<p><em>&#8220;The CDC report is based on a randomized telephone survey of about 9,000 women and 7,400 men. Among the findings: As many as 29 million women say they have suffered severe and frightening physical violence from a boyfriend, spouse or other intimate partner.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>How can information about 29 million women be gathered from 16,400 survey results? Did every single respondent know 1,800 women who suffered severe and frightening physical violence from a boyfriend, spouse or other intimate partner?</p>
<p>There are nations - Muslim nations - where genuine oppression of women is happening. The exaggerated statistics of US feminists mask that fact. Perhaps the CDC learned a lesson from the Park Service. After the Park Service issued a low estimate for attendees to the 1995 Million Man March, it was criticized&hellip; and stopped issuing crowd estimates. </p>

<p>Also, how many men have been the victims of domestic violence?  If a claim is made that men are much more likely to commit domestic violence than women, then let&rsquo;s see the statistics comparing the rates.  Somehow these statistics are never brought up.    <br>

		<p>@Vito #5  &mdash;   For a moment the same thought occurred to me, but then when you review the wording of the study the fly in the ointment is apparent. Since Blacks are so prone to hook up outside anything that a reasonable person could construe as a husband or boyfriend &#8220;relationship&#8221;, the violence resulting from those types of fleeting encounters simply doesn&rsquo;t register for the purposes of this study.</p>

		<p>Anyone doing a study of abused males? <br>
#10, so true.<br>
Males have killed the snakes and slain the dragons. They protected the women and little ones, they built the shelters and dragged home the meat. </p>
<p>It all has changed.  Women kill their own snakes and drag home more meat, and the psychological abuse of the male is swept under the rug.  Basically you have a  bunch of helpless, violent wimps.<br>
I have often said that soccer is a good thing, no wonder the governments of Europe put money into sports arenas, (but not into knitting clubs) to keep the violent urges of the male population channeled into two teams fighting over a ball. </p>

		<p> I read another study claiming that women are more than twice as likely as men to initiate violence towards a partner. Also, violence is much more prevelant amongst lesbian couples than it is within either gay male or heterosexual couples. </p>
<p>  Though on the face of it this study seems more in line with the way &#8220;we&#8221; believe, there is the usual low numbers for Asians, which I don&rsquo;t believe for a second. Females aren&rsquo;t valued in those societies, and their situation has worsened in many cases, China&rsquo;s One Child rule leading to the destruction of female infants being one of the worst examples. It&rsquo;s the furtive and oppressive nature of their societies that skews the numbers.  </p>
<p>  Western women simply don&rsquo;t see how good they&rsquo;ve got (had?) it, nor do they comprehend how destructive and unnatural the mindset of the feminist movement really is. White men in the US are avoiding marriage like the plague, and no wonder-who wants to compete, literally, with one&rsquo;s spouse? I wonder just how many of these feminist &#8220;authors&#8221; are just bitter, barren, wizened old cat ladies? Not a few, I&rsquo;m guessing.<br>

<p>Closing with this paragraph;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to stop leaving the issue of male socialization out of our discussions on violent behavior. And, let&rsquo;s work on socializing our boys to stay in touch with their humanity. Then, and only then, do boys have a chance to refrain from violent behavior in difficult circumstances and a challenging world.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that this is anything but a regurgitated article from 1972!  The authors apparently forgot to notice that boys have been being &#8220;socialized&#8221; for the past 40 years.  The question needs to be asked, why isn&rsquo;t it working?</p>
<p>Books have been written on this question. One good one is titled;</p>
<p>&#8220;The War on Boys,&#8221; by Christina Hoff Sommers.  </p>
<p>The trajectory of males compared to females in America has long been the opposite.  As Sommers opens, she illustrates these trajectories as she compares the situation at the beginning of the 21st century with the success and celebration of events like the local girls soccer team, and the still reverberating shooting spree at Columbine High School.  She demonstrates that boys are being &#8220;socialized&#8221; into gender neutrality by all means including the sort of education and social pressures they live under, but also drugs.  A boy wants to run and play and rougher than girls in general.  When he acts like a boy, he is diagnosed with ADD and drugged.  The result is sedentary boys, growing both obese and distorted emotionally.  </p>
<p>I have read comments from young women who complain that young men are lost in a world of gaming and role playing fantasies.  The trend in films certainly seem to be orientated around fantasy worlds and exaggerated physical and mental prowess.  It appears that many young men have found an escape from the box they&rsquo;ve been being shoved into for 40 years.</p>
<p>On the other end, women have come into power in society.  Most professions are majority female occupied or on a trend toward majority. Certainly, government jobs are dominated by women.  I live on the West Coast.  Most government positions are filled by women.  In my state, Washington, it is a clean sweep with one exception in Congress.  It&rsquo;s a woman run state top to bottom.  I attended a King County bar association (Seattle) conference and found it is run by women exclusively.  Our town is run by women.  Every professional service I have availed myself of here I find women in charge with a few old men here and there.  There was a news story earlier this year regarding the previous 2008 &#8220;Mancession&#8221; where mostly men lost their jobs.  The story was written because the wave was finally hitting government employees and many women were facing layoffs and department budget cuts for the first time.  Amren ran I story lately, I believe, about how minorities are losing more jobs now as government coffers are drying up and many redundant job descriptions are being axed.  Wisconsin&rsquo;s political struggle over collective bargaining was largely a female driven protest because it was largely government, tax payer supported jobs at issue.  Meanwhile, white men have found new jobs as salesmen, drayers, home improvement and such, albeit at lower pay rates and with less or zero benefits.  There have been a plethora of articles in the past ten years touting the success of women via Affirmative Action, EOE, and Protected Groups programs.  </p>
<p>Pick any college and check into a Women&rsquo;s Study class.  The permeating drumbeat is the fomentation of anger and resentment toward men and a call to make changes.  The suppression of males in school from elementary up to the university, especially white men, has often been written on as well and for years.  Yet we see this dated appraisal of the issue credited to The Grand Rapids Press given as of 2005.  What is it said about doing things the same way and expected the same results?</p>
<p>Thankfully, we have some honest women out there like Sommers and Tammy Bruce who will expose what they see from inside and report it to the nation.  What is amazing is that there is little sign of correction other than this sort of call for more of the same failed ideas, and a call for more jails; and more opportunities for female prison guards.</p>

		<p>I read somewhere, and I wish I had the link now, that married white women had a 7%, yes seven percent, likelihood of being abused by their husbands, if their husbands were white. Remember that any study has a plus or minus error rate of 2-3%. So the level could be as high as 10% or as low at 4%. </p>
<p>While I know married white women are not immune to physical violence, this study that I read and I don&rsquo;t have a link to (sorry) included &#8220;pushing&#8221; in the definition of abuse. Because men are anywhere from 4 to 32 times stronger than women, due to their levels of testosterone, women are at a serious disadvantage if men attack us.</p>
<p>What a man thinks is a light &#8220;push&#8221; that wouldn&rsquo;t harm another man, can push a woman down the stairs and break her neck, killing her. Also, if a woman is abused, she is not really going to care about the statistical probability in the abstract as to who is most likely to be abused, because she is being abused. </p>
<p>No matter how &#8220;light&#8221; the man thinks the attack is, it can cause us real harm, especially if we are pregnant, or sick, or injured, or just very much physically smaller. And being a bigger women doesn&rsquo;t help, because it isn&rsquo;t the size of the man   &mdash;   its the size of the fight, i.e, the testosterone levels   &mdash;   in the man.</p>
<p>That being said, I think we need to analyze the racial dynamics and the religious practices of those who is most likely to be abusers.</p>

<p>In fact, since intermarriage between AmerIndians &amp; Whites is extremely high: NA women marry Whites 46.6%. NA men 43.2%, Blacks 2.5% and Hispanics 5.0% - this high abuse rate has been frequently misinterpreted as &#8220;Whites rape their squaws&#8221;. Just,it isn&rsquo;t corroborated by evidence.

		<p>An unpopular truth has to be stated: men/males have to be dominant. That&rsquo;s the way of the world &amp; life. Equal chances yes,&hellip;. but, these auld philosophies (Yin-Yang, Eros-Logos,..) teach us that everyone- female and male- has their place under the sun. And it&rsquo;s not the same. </p>
<p>Popular culture overemphasizes physicality &amp; emotional insensitivity of men- which is, of course, a shallow stereotype(who wrote 1 Corinthians 13 ? St. Paul, a man. Who wrote most lyric- not only epic- poetry ? Men. And not effeminate &#8220;sissies&#8221;- Shakespeare, Villon, Baudelaire, Browning, Shelley, Verlaine, Pushkin, Goethe, Rilke, Yeats, ..- were not &#8220;sissies&#8221;, any way you use this word.</p>
<p><br>
It&rsquo;s the emphasis on one-dimensional macho-Neanderthalism that creates these social pathologies. Which race do you associate with physical violence, lack of introspective self-consciousness, deprecation of intellect &amp; emotions, thuggish behavior, low ethical standards &amp; false posturing as Uber macho sex machines? I think I know the answer.     </p>

I read another study claiming that women are more than twice as likely as men to initiate violence towards a partner. Also, violence is much more prevelant amongst lesbian couples than it is within either gay male or heterosexual couples. </p>

<p><br>
Can you provide the link to this statistic. Both personal experience and other studies would dispute such findings. During my lifetime, I have been the victim of physical violence from a few men in a number of relationships (less than 7). The majority of these men have been White. Two have been non-White. </p>

		<p>Poster number 1 is really being dishonest. She moves from the obvious numbers based on race to making it a gender issue. Certainly men are more violent than women. That&rsquo;s why we died in all of the wars. </p>
<p>But to sit there and say it&rsquo;s not a racial issue when it is black men perpetrating the violent against their white mates and their own race in vastly larger numbers is a falshood.</p>

		<p>It probably helps to remember that many white women are semi-willing partners of black men, often in cases where they cannot afford a good white man or are simply overwhelmed by the black man&rsquo;s aggressive advances. So if this concerned only the whites dating whites and blacks dating blacks then these figures would be different. Almost no white men date black women.<br>
-<br>
And although I don&rsquo;t know of Asians, it is not entirely far fetched to claim that the darker the man, the more violent and sexual he gets. On one side of the spectrum, we have the light, white north European and American males, from there we enter the Mediterranean whites with their more excited personalities and higher libido and jealousy ratings. They sit between &#8216;pure&rsquo; whites and Arabs who look and act far more intimidating (and I think this is biological, not Islam at work) and somewhere above or below Arabs are the non-Arab Turks and the numerous mestizos of Latin America. Then you have blacks with significant white admixture and finally pure blacks with the highest libido and violence ratings.</p>
<p>I also remember reading from a nationalist website the claim that white women&rsquo;s risk of mortality rises 12 times when cohabiting or dating a black man but cannot back this up. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you, G.B.M. Besides which, there&rsquo;s every possibility that the study I read, and it was a few years ago, has been lost to the Internet ether. The freedoms we experience on the Internet, especially with the overbearing commerical presence of WEB 2.0, shrink daily.</p>
<p>  I have to say it though, the expression &#8220;you sure know how to to pick &#8216;em&#8221; springs to mind. I&rsquo;m no mental health expert, but anyone looking at the evidence you&rsquo;ve provided would come to the conclusion that you have a victim complex. You&rsquo;ve obviously developed a pattern and you need to break it. Not everyone is meant to have a partner-it&rsquo;s better to be free on your own than &#8220;coupled&#8221; in an abusive, one-sided relationship. </p>

<p>I would have to concede that when I was in my 20, I did make some unwise choices in regards to partners. I had a tendency (not intentionally) of gettting involved with young married men. I did not know that they were married. Once I found out, I would break off the relationship and that when things became violent. <br>
Now that I am in my late 30s, I have gotten wiser on this issue. </p>
<p>I agree with you, nopt eveyone needs to be in  a relationship or hae a partner. This is true for both heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual people. In fact, I do not have any siginificant partner and most likely will not unless that person turns out to be TRULY SPECIAL.</p>

<p>The Facts: (What the media does not want you to know.)</p>
<p>Spousal Homicide.</p>
<p>White women married to black men are 12 times more likely to be murdered by their husband than white women married to white men. This is even higher than the rate at which black husbands murder black wives. Black men are 33% more likely to murder their wife if she is white.</p>
<p>AIDS.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, black men are ten times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV or AIDS than white men. Among black men who allege that they have never engaged in a homosexual act, the figure rises to about 15 times the rate that heterosexual white men are diagnosed. Studies by the CDC also conclude that black men are more likely to have HIV or AIDS and go undiagnosed than white men.</p>
<p>All of this translates to black women being diagnosed with HIV or AIDS at a rate of over 20 times that of white women. The general trend is for black men to catch HIV/AIDS from each other in prison and then give it to black women when they are released. The CDC believes that 74% of black women who have HIV/AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact with a man.</p>
<p>A 2004 report by the CDC says that AIDS is the:</p>
<p>* the leading cause of death for black women aged 25–34 years.<br>
* the 3rd leading cause of death for black women aged 35–44 years.<br>
* the 4th leading cause of death for black women aged 45–54 years.</p>
<p>By way of comparison, AIDS was only the 11th leading cause of death for white women aged 25-34!</p>
<p>Homicide</p>
<p>The same CDC reports say that homicide is the:</p>
<p>* the leading cause of death among black men aged 15-34 years. (Three age categories!)<br>
* the second leading cause of death for black women aged 15-24 years.<br>
* the fifth leading cause of death for black women aged 25-34 years.</p>
<p>Among women aged 15-24, homicide accounts for 5% of premature deaths in white females, but 20% of all premature deaths by black females.</p>
<p>Among both black and white men, homicide deaths peak at aged 25-34. The death rate by homicide among white men in this age group is 12.5 per 100k, and accounts for 10% of all premature deaths. The death rate by homicide among blacks in this age group is 101.8 per 100k, and accounts for 48% of all premature deaths.</p>
<p>The majority of black female homicide victims are killed by a current or former boyfriend, which many refer to as &ldquo;femicide.&rdquo; About 93% of all black homicide victims are killed by a black perpetrator overall. 85% of white homicide victims are killed by a white perpetrator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The National Black Women&rsquo;s Health Project&rdquo; has identified the battering of women as the number one health issue for African American women (Joseph, 1997).</p>
<p>Femicide is a leading cause of premature deaths in African American women aged 15-44. (Journal of Issues in Nursing Vol 7, No. 1)</p>
<p>In 1998, Salber and Taliaferro reported that the spousal homicide rate among African Americans is 8.4 times more than for whites. The incidence of spousal homicide is 7.7 times higher in interracial marriages compared to intraracial marriages. (Source WebMD.com)</p>
<p>Relationships with black men dramatically increase a woman&rsquo;s chances of dying young.</p>
<p>Black females aged 15-19 are 3.9 times more likely to die of homicide or AIDS than white females in the same age group. This increases to 4.4 time for females aged 20-24 and 7.3 times for 25-34.</p>
<p>White women who engage in relationships with black men astronomically increase their chances of premature death or long term health problems from murder, beatings, and STDs.</p>

If what you say is true, that men are much stronger than women and women are so easily injured from even a &#8220;shove&#8221; from a man, they why are women employed in positions as police officers, firefighters, correction officers and the like. <br>
I will never buy into the claptrapp that women are the primary recipients of domestic violence. Many women are abusers. Women do not face the same branding that men get if accused of domestic violence. Also, there are women that initiate the agression and the man defends himself. When the police arrive the woman turns on the water works and claims &#8220;he beat me up&#8221;.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your abusive relationships as well as the married men who did not disclose their marital status to you. I cannot understand why so many gay men decide to get married and live a double life deceiving their wives and others. Whether they realize it or not, at some point the truth will come out.</p>
<p>We has a sex scandal in our town a few years ago where more than two dozen men were arrested for having sex in parks and other areas. All but three of the men were married and all but five had families. Only four were non-White.    </p>
<p>In 2005, my sister found out her ex-husbnad was having a relationship with other men. It devastated her. Our parents, my siblings, myself were very angry about his decepetive behavior. It has still taken a toll on all of us. Thank goodness there were no kids involved. She has been able to move on and is in a relationship with a wonderful man who kids are grown. The rest of us have managed to move forward as well. </p>
<p>If these men could learn to accept who they are, it would cause alot less heartache and anguish to themselves, their families and to their often unsuspecting spouses. Living a double life does no one any good and cause much unnecessary harm.</p>

		<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>To those commenting on the &#8220;Males commit most domestic Violence&#8221; or the &#8220;Woman Good, Man bad&#8221; theory.. I give you</p>
<p><a href="https://csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm" rel="nofollow">https://csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm</a></p>
<p>&#8220;SUMMARY:  This bibliography examines 282 scholarly investigations: 218 empirical studies and 64 reviews and/or analyses, which demonstrate that women are as physically aggressive, or more aggressive, than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners.  The aggregate sample size in the reviewed studies exceeds 369,800. SUMMARY:  This bibliography examines 282 scholarly investigations: 218 empirical studies and 64 reviews and/or analyses, which demonstrate that women are as physically aggressive, or more aggressive, than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners.  The aggregate sample size in the reviewed studies exceeds 369,800. &#8220;</p>
<p>Women are just as (or slightly more) violent than men.</p>
<p>In circumstances where only one partner is violent - women are the violent aggressor at a 2:1 ratio to male only aggressor. This eliminates the &#8220;Women are only violent in self-defense&#8221;.<br>

		<p>My exhusband was a Middle Eastern Arab- who abused me physically and mentally almost from the day we got married. Most of the other American women that I knew who were married to Middle Eastern men were abused as well- some of them in very horrific sexual ways. There is a big difference between what really constitutes abuse and what feminists want women to believe is abusive. </p>
<p> Anon- I agree, women are taught that anything a man does to them that they dont like is automatically &#8220;abuse&#8221; even if it is verbal and done in the heat of an arguement. Too often this is the scenario  &mdash;   it has been a very bad day for both husband and wife and they get home in a very bad mood. Unfortunately something goes wrong, either with dinner, the kids or some other minor and forgetable thing and an arguement ensues. Heated words and insults are exchanged. He gets tired of the yelling and gets up to go to the door, as he is leaving she grabs his sleeve or arm and he pushes past her. He doesnt mean to hurt her he just wants to get out of the situation to calm down and she is not injured. About an hour he comes back, they make up and go to bed. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for the husband the wife is still upset the next day at work and the subject comes up the next day at work. A coworker of the wife, a single and possibly lesbian feminist tells the wife that she has been &#8220;abused&#8221; and it will only get worse. The wife believes her since she has also been indoctrinated into the feminist belief that any thing a man does to a woman that she doesnt like is abuse so she then makes arrangements to take herself and their kids to a battered women&rsquo;s shelter to force her husband to seek &#8220;help&#8221;. The husband finds himself coming home to an empty home with a restraining order and possibly even charges against him. He now has to go through hell if he wants to see his kids and what had been a decent marriage is now damaged, possibly beyond repair. </p>

		<p>A lot of women are hired in &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; hires for positions that they are not physically suited for. There was famous case several years ago where a black man attacked the 53-year-old 5 foot 2 inch white female baliff who was escorting him to court. He stole her revolver and kidnapped a white woman and then turned himself in. Before he did so, he killed several people. The white woman he kidnapped claimed she read the Bible with him and they prayed. His black girlfriend said that she didn&rsquo;t believe this account, that he had attacked her before he was arrested and she tried to calm him down by asking him to pray with her, but it just enraged him further. The white woman later admitted that she gave the black man who kidnapped her some crystal meth and performed a sex act on him, then fed him pancakes, and this led him to turn himself in.</p>

Actually, Patricia is correct. What did she lie about? Women are more likely to engage in verbal abuse as opposed to physical abuse. It is still domestic violence. Not all domestic violence has to be physical.</p>

<p>I agree with you. You can see this in the number of men who are married with children and engage in sexual activity with other men. Your obviously have experienced this situation yourself. </p>
<p>A few years ago Oprah Magazne had a cover story on the number of women who were leaving their husbands and starting relationships with other women. Bisexuality has always been a part of our society. However, we have tended to place people into either being either &#8220;homosexual or &#8220;heterosexual. A large number of people fall ino neither category. </p>
<p>In fact, it was Freud who stated that it was natural for everyone to have some degree of bisexuality within them.</p>

<p>I am speaking from my personal experience. I have dated pretty much evenly between Black and White men. I have also dated a number of Hispanic men as well. No preference. I am not a racial bigot. I do not harbor the &ldquo;the person does not share my skin color, therefore they are abnormal, freakish or satanic&rdquo; mindset (some of you should consider following suit); however, the relationships where I frequently experienced violence were with White partners. This was the way it has been. <br>

<p>We hetero&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t talk about who we sleep with on this site, so why are you so intent on doing so? Is that part of your &#8220;culture&#8221;?  It is not ours. We are only concerned with our racial survival and to be in control of our own destiny.</p>
<p>As for being &#8220;ignorant&#8221; and &#8220;homophobic&#8221; as you call us, I believe it is YOU who are the ignorant one here. We all know the game plan, people such as you use, by trying to &#8220;shame&#8221; us or make us feel &#8220;guilty&#8221;. Won&rsquo;t work here. You lose.  </p>

Go back to your gay sites and quit trying to turn this site into one, while bringing your friends (trolls) with you.  Try another site where they will be more tolerant of your gate crashing. <br>

<p>Likewise, I am sorry to hear about your sister&rsquo;s situation. I am glad that she was able to weather such a traumatic storm and move on with her life. No one deserves such betrayal. The same holds true for the men whose wives were unsuspecting in my case as well. My anguish was betrayal of a different sort. I was being deceived but in a different manner. I would never make any effort to disrupt any married couple&rsquo;s homelife regardless of sexual orientation. </p>
