			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gavin O&rsquo;Malley, Media Post, November 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At the risk of stereotyping, new research is emerging to help brands make the most of their multicultural marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Online content preferences for each ethnicity are closely tied to the major drivers of their ethnic identity, according to a new report from Yahoo and Mindshare in participation with Added Value.</p>
<p>Indeed, seven in 10 ethnic minorities say that ethnicity remains a significant part of their identity, the study found.</p>
<p>Among the most important drivers are music for African-Americans; political beliefs for Hispanics; and eating habits for Asians. For some categories, ethnicity does not seem to factor as prominently. Automotive, pharmaceuticals, and travel were three prime examples.</p>
<p>However, there are other categories where it&rsquo;s critical for brands to speak directly to specific ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Sixty-two percent of African-Americans want health and beauty products marketed specifically to them; Hispanics  &mdash;  53%  &mdash;  feel ethnicity matters when it comes to CPG [consumer packaged goods], entertainment and clothing, while 50% of Asian respondents said that ethnicity was important in entertainment marketing.</p>

		<p>I have thought about this before, what factors influence me when advertising is present.  Basically they are these:</p>
<p>1) I like to see people who look like me in advertisements (isn&rsquo;t this the argument &#8216;diversity specialists&rsquo; use in flooding adverts with &#8216;people of color&rsquo;?</p>
<p>2) I like to hear voices that speak in the patterns I am used to.  (No ghetto vocabulary, no urban &#8216;truisms&rsquo;, no &#8216;keepin&rsquo; it real&rsquo; platitudes and no poor grammar.)  Even though I was not born in the South, I would rather hear people with Southern accents than people who sound like JayZ.</p>
<p>3) I like storylines and not just a bunch of singing and dancing and posturing.</p>
<p>4) I don&rsquo;t need a lot of smut like ghetto dancing girls or lusty latinas with their hombres in gold chains telling me to get Optimum Online or whatever.  (A lot of commercials in my area are like this now.)</p>
<p>So who are the companies that will market to me and my &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; group?</p>

		<p>As usual, Whites never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.  I always pay attention to the race pictured on a product or used in a company&rsquo;s advertising before I make a purchase.  I also note who uses bilingual coupons or labels and who doesn&rsquo;t.  It doesn&rsquo;t cost me a dime or necessitate a public complaint; I merely tailor my buying accordingly.  Buy WHITE - it&rsquo;s a very simple way to make your preference for your own ethnicity known to advertisers.  Don&rsquo;t buy diapers with black or hispanic children pictured.  Don&rsquo;t buy from Walgreens (all advertising circulars now bilingual) or from Macy&rsquo;s (big full page ad in the paper with a White man and a black woman).  Use your purchasing power to promote your views.</p>

		<p>The experts in selling shoddy and overpriced merchandise use sales tactics that work. In the case of selling to whites, they do indeed target a certain identity that&rsquo;s real popular amongst the sheeple - the &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;sustainable&#8221;, &#8220;social justice&#8221;, &#8220;global&#8221; etc. That&rsquo;s the identity that is embraced and lived by plenty of both the sellers and the target buying audience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that there is any shortage of shoddy and overpriced stuff targeting other kinds of whites. Witness the &#8220;preparedness&#8221; online stores. The message there may make a lot of sense, but products and their prices not so much.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #3, great minds do think alike, because I agree with everything you said! I too have seen those Optimum commercials&hellip;.with the Latino beats, and the dancing bimbos.  It is truly sickening.  There is no way that we would see any commercials geared towards us.  That would be &#8220;Racist&#8221;! Also, whenever there is a White guy in a commercial, especially a White male,,he  is always portrayed as a dimwit moron!  &#8220;The stupid White guy&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>I just watched a show and the commercials in between (start to finish) ALL has Multiculturalism messages in it. I dare you to watch one program where there are no commercials that promote it. You and I both know that is impossible&hellip; </p>
<p>You know why? Because Multiculturalism has infiltrated every aspect of society. They keep saying there needs to be &#8220;diversity&#8221; and yet every form of media has it. Even knowing that, we still are lead to believe that BET (which I&rsquo;m sure you support) is necessary because &#8220;media still dominated by whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly it is not.</p>
<p>I know you know this and think we&rsquo;re stupid and just will stop buying due to there being no such thing&hellip;sorry to disappoint.</p>

		<p>Poster #4 mentioned the Macy&rsquo;s circular with the white guy/black female cover.  I got it the other day and said &#8220;Wow, talk about pushing an agenda.&#8221;  I mean, the black girl was as bantu as they could find - straight outta africa, not even a mixed american black.</p>
<p>Well, the Target circulars are getting really bad.  I got one the other day.  It was about 16 pages.  I saw so few white faces, that I was compelled to count the white vs diveristy quotient on all pics of models.  (I didn&rsquo;t include products that had people pictured on them.)</p>
<p>In the children&rsquo;s section, there were 8 children total.  Not one was a white boy.  Only one white girl.  The rest were asian, black and latino.  Of the young miss clothing section, there were seven models.  Only two were white.  In the men&rsquo;s clothing section, one white guy and five non-whites.  I know that a Target &#8216;diversity officer&rsquo; (black female) was quoted recently saying that Target wanted to &#8216;reflect what was going on in the community&rsquo; but last time I heard (or saw) white people are not 10% or less of th population (yet).  </p>
<p>Sounds to me like someone could do a study of the disappearing white face in advertising, and file a disparate impact lawsuit!</p>

		<p>I wonder why I never see ads for pop wines, hair straighteners, or skin bleaches in Time, Newsweek, the WSJ or Forbes.  Can&rsquo;t their ad managers see this golden opportunity staring them in the face?</p>

<p>If non-whites can connect with, feel and be proud of, I&rsquo;ll be damned if I can&rsquo;t too.</p>

		<p>when watching canadian TV channels I see commercials with mostly black and brown people which totally misrepresents canadian society at large. I wonder what the actual aim is .</p>
