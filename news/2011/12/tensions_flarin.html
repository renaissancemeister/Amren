<h1><a href="https://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8460213">Tensions Flaring over Chicago Ward Remap</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ravi Baichwal, ABC Local, December 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The contentious process of redrawing the boundaries of Chicago&rsquo;s ward map has split along ethnic and racial lines.<br>
A shift in the city&rsquo;s population could be pitting African-American, Latino and white aldermen against each other.</p>
<p>It is a backroom process that is hard to get comment on, with most players involved saying that an agreement will be reached, but with the 2010 census showing a rise in Chicago&rsquo;s Hispanic population and a downturn in the number of African-Americans living in the city, the legally-mandated effort to provide Chicago&rsquo;s Hispanic communities with more aldermen means less representation for others.<br>
	<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Thursday afternoon, 22nd Ward alderman Ricardo Munoz, a leader in the Hispanic community who is also running for clerk of Cook County Circuit Court  &mdash;  said it is important to get the new map right.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Negotiations] have gotten pretty tense in the last ten days, but the bottom line here is we&rsquo;re talking about people&rsquo;s future. We&rsquo;re talking about geography that we&rsquo;re going to represent for the next ten years, so people can get pretty testy,&#8221; said Munoz.</p>
<p>33rd Ward alderman and Rules Committee Chairman Richard Mell has held a series of meetings with aldermen to outline plans that would raise majority-Hispanic wards three seats to 13 wards, decrease African-American wards by one to 18 and keep the rest white. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For Latinos, it&rsquo;s real easy: If we&rsquo;re one-third of the city, why are we only one-fifth of the city council? Said Munoz.</p>
<p>In all but one decade over the last 50 years, the redistricting process has ended up spawning a costly referendum for the city followed by legal battles. Only after the 2000 census did that not happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-Americans were gaining, not losing, that was one he one big dynamic and Latinos didn&rsquo;t yet have sufficient political power to completely flex their political muscles,&#8221; said University of Illinois-Chicago Political Science Professor Dick Simpson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At least one of Mell&rsquo;s meetings earlier this week devolved into a shouting match. 34th Ward Alderman Carrie Austin denounced the 73-year old council veteran, saying he was acting as if black aldermen were &#8220;plantation n-word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Racial power is still important in Chicago. We are the most segregated city in North America. 82 percent of the people would have to move out of their neighborhood into another neighborhood to have a racial mix that was equal to the city&rsquo;s overall mix or the metropolitan region,&#8221; said Simpson.</p>

<p>Because the Hispanic population tends to be younger and a large percentage of it is too young to vote.  And it&rsquo;s a population that has not yet discovered the power of the political process, at least compared to the blacks.</p>
<p>If current trends continue, by the time they do this redistricting again in 2021, there will probably be more Latino seats than black seats, simply because Chicago&rsquo;s civic elite are engaged in an under-the-radar effort to shove as many ghetto blacks as possible out of the southside and into south suburban Cook.</p>

		<p>What of the black gangs that were going into white parts of Chicago and calling for killing white people?  Is that not as big of an issue as black and hispanic crybabies not getting their own way again?</p>

<p>America owes nothing to Latinos.  They are flooding in here and then demanding - yes, demanding - to be given power.  Imagine the gall.  Their only weapon is their incessant ability to break through our borders and the wombs of their fertile young mothers.  Why we allow this to go on is beyond me.  </p>

		<p>Speaking as a Chicagoan, it is time to abolish the city council. They are 50 useless people with no power. At one time they served a purpose. If you needed a service they would go to the department and get it done. With today&rsquo;s modern equipment, you can just E-Mail a request. We can save on salaries and pension.</p>

		<p>And these very Chicago blacks, almost to a man, would continue to give full-hearted support to their homeboy, Obama.  Regardless of low IQ&rsquo;s or utter ignorance, most probably know about the Prez&rsquo;s open-borders sentiments, which is slated to bring even more woe to the political aspirations of black Chicagoans.  </p>

		<p>I think that hispanic alderman&rsquo;s comment about entitlement to a certain number of representatives based on the percentage of Hispanic residents should be made into the poster for why we need to stop letting so many Hispanics into the country.  Under his comments, perhaps a phrase like, &#8220;Who will represent Anglos when we become outnumbered?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one represents us now so this will not be an effective slogan. Better to be ruled by Hispanics or Asians than by blacks.</p>

		<p>Bernie: No one represents us because we don&rsquo;t stick together as a race.  When we start recognizing ourselves as a distict group who&rsquo;s rights and interests are being undermined by other distinct groups, our own leaders will emerge.  I no more want to be ruled by Asians or Hispanics than by Blacks.  None of them are my people.</p>

<p>By &#8216;getting it right&rsquo; what they mean and what all of these redistricting plans amount to are efforts to increase black and hispanic political power in regions where they are a minority. Meanwhile whites who are minorities in districts where they live are just ignored or are actually having their political clout purposefully reduced. Then the media will find a way to cover these redistricting plans and the issue of redistricting as if this is not true and as if it is once again people of color are the victims. </p>

<p>Robert, these are always my sentiments. </p>
<p>Sadly, our numbers will continue to dwindle. However, at least the most destructive and hateful creatures of all will finally begin to fall as well. My only wish is that their downfall would generate from us, but that obviously isn&rsquo;t going to happen (and you can blame the mentally-ill libs for that). </p>

		<p>I agree with Robert.  Anything is better than black.  Just look at the decline in murders in Los Angeles when Hispanics replaced blacks.  2 years ago, the number of murders was equal to the number of murders in 1967 although the population was twice as high.</p>
<p>The best thing is that the blacks are being driven out of the racial spoils civil service system.  That means competent civilized Hispanics and Asians instead of the grunting, growling blacks who managed to mess up everything. </p>
<p>As a White whose live was destroyed by affirmative action, I celebrate the downfall of blacks.  They destroyed Whites as stormtroopers and cannon fodder in a marxist led race war against Whites.</p>
<p>Now the blacks are starting to go down in a marxist led war against blacks using Hispanics as stormtroopers.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip about the movement of blacks to S. Cook county.   I don&rsquo;t plan to move to Illinois, but it is good to keep abreast of the enemy&rsquo;s movements in this race war we are losing.</p>
