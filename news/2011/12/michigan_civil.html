<h1>Michigan Civil Rights Leaders Plan an Occupy Protest at Gov. Rick Snyder&rsquo;s Home on Martin Luther King Jr. Day</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Neavling, Detroit Free Press, December 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michigan civil rights leaders, saying the new emergency manager law unfairly targets predominantly African-American communities, pledged Monday to march in Superior Township  &mdash;  home of Gov. Rick Snyder  &mdash;  on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>
<p>Thousands plan to march in the township, about 12 miles east of Ann Arbor, on Jan. 16 in an effort to call attention to a law that could soon lead to the appointment of an emergency manager in Detroit.</p>
<p>The cities under an emergency manager are Flint, Benton Harbor and Pontiac. Detroit Public Schools also has an emergency manager.</p>
<p>The leaders opposes the law because an emergency manager has unilateral authority to cut union contracts, sell assets and dismiss elected officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We started this fight in Benton Harbor but we plan to end it in Superior Township,&#8221; said the Rev. D. Alexander Bullock, leader of the Michigan Chapter Rainbow Push Coalition, a social justice group founded by Jesse Jackson. &#8220;We will show the world that democracy is at stake in Michigan just as it is in Libya or Egypt.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Emergency managers are not necessary when populations exhibit self-governing behavior; or </p>
<p>The need for emergency managers demonstrates that some populations are not capable of self-government.</p>
<p>And yes, democracy, as it has been re-defined over the last 90 years, is at stake in Michigan. The reason is because modern democracy is failing in some political subdivisions with certain things in common.</p>
<p>Kind of like the Ivory Coast.</p>

Looks like &#8220;push&#8221; is coming to &#8220;shove&#8221;.</p>
<p>The abbreviation &#8220;P.U.S.H&#8221; is supposed to stand for &#8220;People United to Save Humanity&#8221;. But, nobody in the know things Jessie Jackson was ever going to &#8220;Save&#8221; all of &#8220;Humanity&#8221;</p>
<p>The Michigan governor should do what folks in Chicago, IL did - buy off Jessie and his lazy family with some corporate job - get a beer distributorship, that sort of thing.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it seem that these special managers are the answer to the prayers, I mean, protesters demands?  Don&rsquo;t they want to clean up the corruption that has led to the demise of jobs and government goodies?  Or do they think that money just bubbles up from sewers?</p>

		<p>Just a handful of days ago, when AR had the first story about Detroit perhaps falling under the state emergency fiscal authority, I begged Gov. Snyder not to, because the state&rsquo;s administration will be a crutch that blacks would use to excuse Detroit&rsquo;s continued failure, and of course it would continue to be a failure.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>If the state doesn&rsquo;t do anything, the black civil rights crowd will complain about the &#8220;racism&#8221; of not doing anything to &#8220;save&#8221; Detroit.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t win with these people, so you can&rsquo;t make political decisions and calculations based on pleasing them, for there is no pleasing them.  So the decision has to be what is good for everyone else, especially the white taxpayer.  I still think standing down and doing nothing is the best option, but for different reasons now.</p>

		<p>If I were the governor of Michigan, I wouldn&rsquo;t appoint an emergency manager but I wouldn&rsquo;t provide any support to the city at all.  Let the checks bounce and the city deal with the consequences.</p>

		<p>How is it unfair if the state is trying to save a black city from complete self- destruction?</p>
<p>I say fine, no emergency managers. You&rsquo;re on your own.</p>
<p>Let us know how things are when the food runs out and there is no electricity.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m tired of hearing whites say, &#8220;We&rsquo;ll be a minority then and it will be too late.&#8221;  Well, we&rsquo;re a majority now and we&rsquo;re letting people push us around.  We are the ones that gave up our power.</p>
<p>However, look on the bright side.  Everytime whites have been invaded and enslaved by Muslims, African pirates, Asian invaders, the movie 300, etc the white men eventually got a backbone and slaughtered our enemies.</p>

		<p>Number 6 has it right&hellip;do nothing, allow the checks from the city to bounce, and remind the people, &#8220;we have no money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody has an idiot relative who is a drain on the productive members of the family, nothing ever changes except the lie about future performance.  Put it up to national level, all the same.</p>
<p>Allow the riots and demands, it doesn&rsquo;t print money from nothing.</p>

		<p>BO_Bill (#1) is right. Blacks are incapable of <i>political</i> self-government because they are equally incapable of <i>moral</i> self-government. (The few who didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama excepted, of course.) The Founders knew this and warned that liberty and licentiousness are incompatible   &mdash;   a precept going clear back to Moses and the 10 Commandments. Space here doesn&rsquo;t permit me to paste all the quotes on the matter; just research the writings of John Adams, Patrick Henry, Ben Franklin, George Washington and others.</p>
<p>Several things about the soon-to-be former USA will have future historians scratching their heads bald. One of them will be (a) how a race with a 70% illegitimacy rate could demand inclusion into polite society, and (b) how polite society could have been so spineless as to cave in to that demand.</p>

		<p>How appropriate that this is being planned for MLK Day (Marchin&rsquo; Lootin&rsquo; Killin&rsquo;) - since that day is symbolic of a failed race who cannot produce for themselves but must rely on the politics of plunder in order to have resources transferred to their lazy people.</p>

		<p>Yes, Detroit should not have any emergency manager. It should be left to fester. Advertise free cruises to Haiti for those poor huddled masses, yearning to breathe free from American governmental structures aimed at saving a city budget from forty years of an Africa-run city. The Tigers won in &#8216;68, as if for one American moment. Today the French ribbon-farms of old Detroit (so each farmer could have an elongated plot with a bit of river frontage, and hosting  buried souls under the skyscrapers) as well as decayed churches like St. Anne&rsquo;s downtown, represent the actual oppression, the real oppression, of this quintessential American city. The most under-understood thing going around now is that all is lost. It is not. For example, God help me, Detroit will rise again, when the general rising of America begins. What or who is Detroit? Who is a Detroiter, actually? We know the answer, and for those of you who don&rsquo;t live in Michigan, wait and see. It ain&rsquo;t Ice Cube. </p>
