<h1><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/minorities-research/2011/12/09/id/420425">Bayer Corp.: Research Universities Failing Minorities</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandy Fitzgerald, Newsmax, December 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than one-third of the nation&rsquo;s top 200 research universities are failing to retain and graduate minority students, says Pittsburgh-based Bayer Corp, a problem that has not improved much over the years. </p>
<p>The company conducted a poll of department heads at the university, and 37 percent of them gave their schools a &#8220;C&#8221; or lower on how they retain and graduate black, Hispanic, and Native American students, said the Pittsburgh Tribune Review.</p>
<p>Bayer surveyed heads of departments in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields, which it calls &#8220;STEM&#8221; disciplines, marking the fifth time the company surveyed diversity representation in the sciences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are many factors keeping minority students away from the &#8220;STEM&#8221; courses. One-third of the faculty heads said the students have only limited quality college prep courses in STEM fields, and 17 percent said there was a lack of role models in the fields.</p>
<p>For 10 percent of the teachers, minorities&rsquo; &#8220;cultural background doesn&rsquo;t value science (and/or) the pursuit of science.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I think the Bayer Corporation mentioned here is the one that makes the aspirin.  You never know for sure.  Rand Corporation is a think tank, so there might be a chance that Bayer Corp. is also that.</p>
<p>But if it is the pharmaceutical, then I think this is basically a PR maneuver to keep from the Obama/Holder DOJ suing it for not hiring enough of the right kind of minorities.  &#8220;Don&rsquo;t blame us, it&rsquo;s the schools&rsquo; fault.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This means that forty per cent of the respondents blame the problem on institutional racism? Or maybe intellectual deficiency?</p>

		<p>Kind of ironic that these schools of science are stymied that  test scores (measurable data input) of admitted students is just as important for blacks as whites in determining likelihood of academic success (experimental data outcome).</p>

		<p>What did the corporations expect? That Hollyweird science fiction about clever blacks is real?  The black middle class has been a wacky pipe dream from the get-go. You should see how the next generation is turning out   &mdash;   commuter criminals with sophisticated communications devices organizing mobs and bongo parties.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re supposed to believe that if only blacks were given more smiles, handshakes and pats on the back then this silly race gap would just go away.</p>

		<p>There are more black &#8216;role model&rsquo; scientists in Hollywood movies than ever. Doesn&rsquo;t seem to be helping.</p>
<p>Where on earth did this idea that blacks fail due to lack of role models idea come from?</p>

		<p>Ya gotta love the way they turn things up-side-down in order to shift the blame for failure.  You hear the same reversal of falt applied to the prison system, the school system, the ecconomic disparity, and on and on.  All these things are blaring evidence that racial differences in intelligence are an obvious reality, but in order to perpetuate this national fairy tale of equality, we keep turning the truth on its head.</p>

		<p>If I have this straight, universities accept quota NAMs functioning at a sixth grade level and want the public to pretend to be suprised when the aforementioned diversitoids can&rsquo;t hack university-level coursework.</p>
<p>As for the suggested reasons that these NAMs stay away from the STEM courses, might the fact that these fields require a level of intelligence and work discipline not required for Black Racial Grievance Studies, Latino Racial Grievance Studies, Transgendered Grievance Studies and Vegetarian Peace Studies have something to do with the matter?<br>

		<p>I read the original article. Yes, it is Bayer the German pharma company. I agree with comment #1. Bayer knows not to expect busloads of &#8220;minority&#8221; science graduates. They are just shifting the responsibility for their &#8220;lack of diversity&#8221; to universities while trying not to laugh out loud. </p>

		<p>As I have said before, it is not so much the universities which are failing the minorities, as it is the elementary schools.  Without a good, solid background in reading and arithmetic, their is no way they can go on.</p>

		<p>So&hellip; What&rsquo;s the argument here?  That minorities should get passing grades for courses they actually fail?    What are we trying to do to Western Civilization anyway, make stupid the new smart?  </p>

		<p>Since when did it become the mission of top universities to &#8216;retain&rsquo; or &#8216;graduate&rsquo; ANYBODY?</p>
<p>Tulane didn&rsquo;t give a Rat&rsquo;s (ugly word) whether I swam or sank.  I felt honored just to get in.  I struggled to keep my head above water, and NOBODY CARED.  Nobody ever sent Daddy a letter thanking him for shelling out tens of thousands of Dollars a year to keep me in that Misery Mill. In fact, my impression was that deliberate and sustained efforts were made by my school to thin the herd&hellip;to winnow-out as many of us as could be jettisoned.</p>
<p>My impression is that this has always been the norm among &#8216;top universities&rsquo;.  So how can this deep concern for the graduation and &#8216;retention&rsquo; rates of NAMs be justified?  How can it be justified that an entirely different and more benign approach be reserved just for Blacks and Hispanics?</p>
<p>Even when University was for the sons of the Upper Class, there were implicit expectations that one would either complete and comprehend the course work, or that one would leave the University.  The universities did not fret unduly, over whether certain groups tended to fail.  And I believe that, even then, there were entrance exams, which ensured that those unfit for University would not be a hindrance.</p>
<p>When Isaac Babel was struggling to be among the Jewish students in the Ukraine, whose numbers were limited by a quota, he worked himself nearly to death, to be among the most brilliant of the brilliant.  In China, many applicants are capable of excelling at the course work, but relatively few are accepted.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works: Many Qualified Applicants/Few Openings.</p>
<p>So, how can anyone justify this concern for students who CAN&rsquo;T COMPREHEND THE COURSE WORK?  </p>

<p>So this is Bayer Corp as in Bayer Aspirin? I&rsquo;m reminded of one of my favorite ethnic jokes. An oldie but a goodie.</p>
<p>Q: Why do they make aspirins white?</p>
<p>A: You want them to WORK, don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>One could argue that the differences stem from culture instead. That can&rsquo;t be true, however, because we&rsquo;re all forced to worship that culture, or is it just them? </p>

<p>And this always fails in the long run. You HAVE to complain about unfair policies to get them changed. You eventually win when the people see authorities retaliate against someone for just speaking his fair opinion. And better yet, facts.</p>

		<p>I have brought this up before. Consider the gene pool of various people. The most adventurous Europeans came to America, the lowest ranking blacks were enslaved and brought to America and finally only the brightest Asian were allowed entry to America. There you have it. I don&rsquo;t think any one of the people are intellectually superior but it has to do with their immigration pattern.</p>
