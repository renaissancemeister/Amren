<h1>Black Death Row Inmate Hopes Low IQ Gets Him Off Death Row</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Harper, Florida Courier, December 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After hearing testimony in a Volusia County courtroom for nearly four hours from three different psychologists in the death row appeal case of Roger Lee Cherry, Judge Frank Marriott on Tuesday ordered attorneys to have their closing arguments to him by Feb. 28, 2012.</p>
<p>The psychologists were defense witnesses and were called to help prove that Cherry&rsquo;s last IQ test of 64 is accurate and too low for him to be executed. In Florida, death row inmates must have an IQ above 70 to be executed.</p>
<p>Cherry previously has appealed his case claiming &#8220;that the race discrimination that permeates Volusia County and the Seventh Judicial Circuit &hellip; infected his own trial, deprived him of his rights to equal protection and freedom from cruel or unusual punishment under the state and federal constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September 1987, Cherry was tried and convicted by an all-White jury for the murders of Leonard and Esther Wayne, an elderly White couple.</p>
<p>&#8220;They (the state of Florida) are saying the 64 (IQ score) is not valid. We are saying it is valid,&#8221; said Linda McDermott, Cherry&rsquo;s attorney.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cherry, 60, sat emotionless at the Volusia County S. James Foxman Justice Center with hopes that his second appeal for a killing more than 25 years ago is successful.</p>
<p>Cherry had a previous IQ score of 72. A score must be below 70 to be exempt from death penalty. The average IQ in the United States is set at 100.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Individuals with IQs below 70 have been essentially exempted from the death penalty in the U.S. since 2002.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Cherry burglarized the home of the Waynes in June 1986. Mrs. Wayne, 77, died of multiple blows to the head and her husband, 80, died of a heart attack.</p>

		<p>If an I.Q. of 70 and under exempts a person from suffering the consequences of their criminality it follows logically that they should also be exempt from the benefits of citizenship, particularly the right to vote. We have seen the consequences of allowing votes for a people to stupid to know murder and they are far more dangerous than the odd murder or so.</p>

		<p>Never fully understood the reasoning behind laws like this.  The theory is that a mentally retarded, or very low IQ person, doesn&rsquo;t fully understand consequences of their actions.  Perhaps this is so, however, what is the point of keeping such a person alive?  If their IQ is so low as to not understand the consequences of murder, what is the chance they could ever be rehabilitated and turned into useful citizens?  And why should we keep them alive in prison?  Why should the other prisoners be endangered by someone so dangerous?  Incarceration is punishment by loss of freedom, not loss of life at the hands of other prisoners, or at least it should be.  I see no truly justifiable reason to keep these people alive just because they are low IQ.  They have proven themselves to be a threat to society and of no real value.<br>

		<p>Maybe we should do race norming here.</p>
<p>If the average IQ of African-Americans is 85, then the equivalent of a 70 IQ for whites is 55 for them. (Ask P. Rushton to check out my math.)</p>

		<p>Well, given that 70 or so is the average IQ of a black person, fully half of blacks residing in Florida can now not be executed.  Shouldn&rsquo;t there be a sliding scale based on race?  For blacks, a 70 IQ makes them a fully functioning and average member of their &#8220;race&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Antonio Richardson, who along with three other men, raped and murdered two girls, got his death penalty reversed because he was &#8220;retarded.&#8221; One who wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;retarded,&#8221; just stupid, was executed by lethal injection in Missouri. Another got life in prison, and a 15-year-old served 15 years before being released.</p>

		<p>TWENTY-FIVE (!!) years ago, this excrement in human form was convicted of a double murder, which he committed after planning a burglary, and to cover up that burglary.  He has been living well on the taxpayer since. (Probably would have died long ago had been out on the street.) Are we to believe he didn&rsquo;t know right form wrong? That beating to death an old lady wasn&rsquo;t a crime?  What drivel!</p>

		<p>Execute only white males that are millionaires and have IQ&rsquo;s above 150. Everyone would be satisfied then. NO possibility for NAACP or ACLU appeals then. All sorts of white millionaires with IQ&rsquo;s above 150 all the time murdering elderly white couples or going to liquor stores and blowing the patrons away. Happens all the time.

		<p>2 Istvan:  Let me drop a fancy Latin legal phrase on you.  <i>Mens Rea.</i> (Not to be confused with Men&rsquo;s Room.) It is not stated in this article, but Cherry and his defense lawyers would be perfectly happy if the state dropped the drip and gave him life in prison.  But by doing that, they&rsquo;re admitting he had the <i>mens rea</i> to commit first degree murder.  If he&rsquo;s too stupid to execute, then why isn&rsquo;t he too stupid to incarcerate for life?  That&rsquo;s the whole crux of their case against Cherry getting the death penalty, that his &#8220;low IQ&#8221; meant that he couldn&rsquo;t possibly understand that smashing in the head of an elderly woman would kill her.  If he couldn&rsquo;t grok that such that he shouldn&rsquo;t get the death penalty, then it stands to reason that he shouldn&rsquo;t get life in prison either.</p>
<p>4 John Engelman:  The good news is that some judges and prosecutors have caught wise to that scam of tanking an IQ test in prison to be &#8220;retarded&#8221; to get a &#8220;get out of execution free card.&#8221;  If a condemnee tries to play the Low IQ card, the judges and prosecutors will want to see school and childhood and adolescent IQ tests going back quite a ways.  The inconvenient problem for the condemnee is this   &mdash;   Schools and other childhood education institutions have mostly jettisoned IQ tests for the racial taboo, so as time goes on, there is less and less likelihood that they&rsquo;ll have a childhood IQ paper trail lying around in some file cabinet.</p>

		<p>This arbitrary cutoff of 70 is silly.  Some people, I would say almost all, who have an IQ of less than 70 still know what is right and what is wrong</p>
<p>What does IQ have to do with the supposed bias of the justice system in the county?  Looks like they are trying to pull out all stops.</p>

		<p>If this is the case, wouldn&rsquo;t that mean more black criminals who&rsquo;ve committed violent crime would be spared the death penalty? If you get handed the death penalty, then so be it, regardless of race. There shouldn&rsquo;t be an IQ based criteria for that. </p>

		<p>just the opposite rule should be applied. if an intelligent person commits murder there should be a fair trial and if found  guilty, they should be executed. if your dog, or say a bull,or some wild animal kills someone we shoot them immediately, because they do not have the intelligence to know what they&rsquo;ve done. same should apply to low IQ people, if they kill, shoot them immediately, problem solved.</p>

		<p>This is a perfect example of liberals not seeing any irony in holding completely contradictory views to make their political  points.  On the one hand they say there is no such thing as IQ.  On the other, liberal elites regard themselves as brilliant and always the smartest person in the room.  Also, they invoke low IQs when trying to nullify the death penalty.</p>
<p>By the way, just what legal principle is it that creates this &#8220;right&#8221;?  </p>

		<p>There was something similar here in NYC years ago, this involved the two people who went into a Wendy&rsquo;s in Flushing Queens with pistols drawn, they entered as the restaurant was closing and forced the crew to the basement where they where all tied up and gagged with tape around there mouths, as they where leaving after they had gotten what ever money was on the premises, they went back to where the people where tied up and put plastic bags over there heads and shot each one in the head, no witnesses you know. One of the people lived but all the rest where killed. These two where caught in due course and in the trial one of the two Craig Godineaux was judge not fit for trial because he had as his shyster said, the mentality of a 12-year old, I screamed, How many 12 year olds have the where through all to get a loaded weapon go and commit a robbery and kill everyone in site ! and Godineneaux got away with it, his Shyster successfully got him only life in prison, making him out to this idiot while the other John Taylor got death (his was overturned, he is now in for life). HMMM these are the very same things that the OWS crowd believe should be released from prison, right ? Wasn&rsquo;t one of their demands no more life in prison without the possibility of parole?</p>

		<p>Why would it not be based on the same standard as insanity? A person is legally insane if he truly was too out of it to know right from  wrong, which rarely ever happens. Most serial killers don&rsquo;t even fit into the insanity definition. </p>
<p>So regardless of IQ, the standard should be the same as insanity. IQ should not be an issue, knowing right from wrong should be the issue. And most criminals(99 percent) do infact know right from wrong. Are they lumping all people who are labeled &#8220;retarded&#8221; as not knowing right from wrong? Isn&rsquo;t that an insult to people with low IQ&rsquo;s who are not criminals?</p>

		<p>The problem is that most people think because someone is put on death row they are incapable of hurting another human being. This a complete fallacy.</p>
<p> Death row inmates are allowed yard time with other inmates and interact with correctional officers for visits, court writs, medical issues, showers, etc. and often attack these staff and inmates. To say a death row inmate will never hurt anyone again is simply not true.</p>

		<p>A black with a sub-seventy IQ is not necessarily &#8220;mentally retarded&#8221; in the manner of a Caucasian or Oriental with the same score. The higher races rely more on the advanced neocortex and less on the more primitive neurological structures, making intellectual deficits far more debilitating to them. Blacks, even when sporting distinctly low IQs are socially functional and capable of independent living within the context of state-supported ghetto savagery.  </p>

<p>I have no problem executing the criminally insane, the retarded, and those professing their alleged innocence.

		<p><i>The Marine Corps enlists individuals with a minimum i.q. of 69.</i></p>
<p>Do you have a source for this?</p>
<p>The military uses the AFQT, a highly g-loaded, IQ-equvilent based test to screen recruits. A recruit must score at the 31st percentile or above, which roughly correlates with an IQ of of 92.</p>
<p>The Educational Trust writes in <i>Shut out of the Military</i>:</p>
<p><i>Recruits must score at least in the 31st percentile on the first stage of the three-hour test to get into the Army or the Marines. Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard recruits must have higher scores.</i></p>
<p><i>The average score for blacks is 38, for Hispanics 44, Whites, 55.</i></p>
<p>https://goo.gl/UmfUv</p>
<p>This is because the military has found that low IQs correlates highly with discipline problems, an inability to follow commands or master basic skills such as shooting straight and in life or death situations, that&rsquo;s the last thing the military wants or needs.  Also, the military is now high tech and well knows that high aptitude is vital to running, maintaining and repairing complex equipment.</p>
<p>Or, as Fred Kaplan writes in Slate: <i> A dumber military is a weaker military.</i></p>
<p>Enlistment Eligibility 2010</p>
<p>The minimum AFQT score required to qualify for entry into the military varies by branch.</p>
<p>Service Branch Minimum Required AFQT Score</p>
<p>Army 31 [i.e., 31st percentile]</p>
<p>Navy 35</p>
<p>Marines 32</p>
<p>Air Force 40</p>
<p>Coast Guard 45</p>

		<p>Ref. #2.  <br>
It is interesting to contemplate an extension of this issue to<br>
having longer sentences or more life sentences for the mentally<br>
retarded  &mdash;  and, perhaps to having prisoners at this level of functioning given some sort of merciful in-prison &#8220;asylum&#8221; from mixing with the typical dull-normal prison population?   Unless you&rsquo;ve taught or supervised  the mentally retarded in<br>
school, you may easily make overly-optimistic assumptions about the level of responsibility they have.  By traditional measures of intelligence or adaptive behavior assessment, about 25%  &mdash;  25%  &mdash;  of the Black population in the US is mentally retarded.  It appears to be just another domain in which prevailing racial myths and contrived confusions work to the disadvantage of everyone. </p>
