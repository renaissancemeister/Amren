<h1>NBC to Launch Latest in Series of New Latino Web Sites</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Post, December 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>NBC is launching the latest in a slew of new English-language Latino online news sites.</p>
<p>The managing editor of NBCLatino.com, Chris Pena, says the site will launch in early 2012 but did not give a specific date. {snip}</p>
<p>Pena says the new site will leverage NBC Universal&rsquo;s resources, including those of its Spanish-language network Telemundo. It will focus on the U.S. Hispanic community.</p>
<p>Telemundo&rsquo;s rival, Spanish-language giant Univision already has a similar English-language news site and Facebook page. Last year, Fox News unveiled its online Fox News Latino. And The Huffington Post recently launched Huffpost LatinoVoices.</p>

		<p>But who is going to watch these shows?  The number of latinos who come here and refuse to enter the world of english is growing by leaps of bounds.  They mostly stick with straight-up spanish stations where english never appears.</p>

		<p>Translation: NBC will also brainwash Latinos with mind control-psyops, and make a handy profit in the process. Just like the rest of the entertainment cartel near monopoly.</p>

		<p>One wonders, what(or whom) exactly is/are the &#8220;Hispanic Community?&#8221; How can such a wide-ranging group of people be lumped together so all of the time? Mexicans, Hondurans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Peruvians, Dominicans, etc., etc - are we to believe ALL of these people from hither and thither all have some monolithic interest that NBC can tap into thus? Are the interests of Cubans seriously the same as those of transplanted Guatamalans? Or is it all just another cynical way to peddle multiculturalism - the acknowledged failure that it is?! </p>
<p>This whole &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; thing is an enormous canard, created to give the impression of some unified, similarly-minded group of enthusiastic &#8220;immigrants,&#8221; just waiting to become Americans. Instead, they are a disparate ethnic mish-mash of peoples, from Caucasians to Mestizos to blacks and any combination of the three, and from cultures as different as Norwegian is from Spanish!! <br/>

<p>But their hatred of the gringo and America brings them together.  They are not here to become Americans and they are here to take what America has.</p>
<p>They do have one thing in common with previous generations of European immigrants.  In my observation the second and third generation of Hispanics interbreed with other Hispanic groups, resulting in a gradual &#8220;darkening&#8221; of the race as the white or mestizo elements have babies with the more African types.<br/>

		<p>HH (at No. 1), you are absolutely correct.  One wonders who benefits, and has benefited from, the creation of this ethnic, racial or linguistic group (it is truly none of these), and why the government has continued, increasingly, to promote it. Is it so the Democratic Party will have more voters?  Is it because of some seed of self-hatred of the elites running this country?  Does it benefit big business?   It sure as heck does not benefit the United States, in fact it weakens the great culture we and our ancestors have enjoyed.<br/>
 I may have mentioned this before, but in completing my census form last year, I refused to fill out anything regarding race or ethnicity, and in fact enclosed a note to the effect that this distinction had nothing to do with the purpose of the census as it was intended, which was to determine population for representation. Naturally, I was paid a personal visit from a census worker.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that a lot of the programs will be hosted by the cute (and 100% White) Natalie Morales.</p>

		<p>OF COURSE the American media needs to start catering to &#8220;hispanic&#8221; people.<br/>
In just a few more years they will be almost half the population.</p>

		<p>To poster #7, I live in a major east coast, in a very Asian area (recent Chinese and Korean immigration waves), but in all the department stores around here you see dual language signs in English and Spanish, even though Latinos are not the majority immigrant group here.</p>
<p>That has recently made me think: Asians will learn English, but Latinos will not, and we enable it from the corporate boardroom to our classrooms.  Something to chew on. </p>

In my observation the second and third generation of Hispanics interbreed with other Hispanic groups, resulting in a gradual &ldquo;darkening&rdquo; of the race as the white or mestizo elements have babies with the more African types.&#8221; Explain how this is similar to what European immigrants did, or are you just referencing the fact that the Euro-Americans tended to interbreed with each other (ethnically) after the first generation?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Bobster&#8221;  I&rsquo;m sure you are right on the money there! The green-eyed, fully Caucasian Morales (who is indeed very attractive*) loves to talk about her &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; roots - yeah, Natalie, you&rsquo;re really just like those four-foot-tall, dark brown-skinned Amerindian trolls who now clog every other town in this nation! What foolishness!</p>

		<p>Its rather intriguing that the immoral left wing media labels these South Americans as &ldquo;Latino&rdquo;. Since the Latin language and people originated in Italy about 320 BC, that would make Italians (who are Caucasians) real Latin&rsquo;s. These characters are not Latin but Hispanics.  Just more lies and propaganda from the left!</p>
