In so doing, that publication once more confirmed how thoroughly silenced are the voices that will speak through American Renaissance.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Merely to put the words &#8220;race, immigration, and the decline of civility&#8221; in the same sentence is to step across the line that separates what may be said publicly from what may not. Despite the American tradition of free speech and the fervor with which we claim to defend it, nearly every American takes the greatest care not to cross that line. There are subjects on which debate has ended, the book has been closed, and this is to be so no matter how much the reality of our daily lives clashes with conclusions that have been declared as final.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Today it is foreigners who have not learned the limits of what may be said in America who are most likely to step across that strongly defended line. In 1986, then-Prime Minister Nakasone of Japan provoked a torrent of outrage when he said that because large numbers of blacks and Hispanics live in the United States, it cannot compete as effectively with other nations as it might otherwise.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">In fact, blacks and Hispanics are, compared to whites, far more likely to be poor, illiterate, on welfare, or in jail; they are far more likely to have illegitimate children, be addicted to drugs, or have AIDS. By no definition of international competitiveness can the presence of these populations be anything but a disadvantage. How many Americans must have thought to themselves, &#8220;Mr. Nakasone is right&#8221;   &mdash;   and said nothing? Americans of European heritage, the cultural heirs of the people who founded and built this nation, were silent.</p><table class="boxcenter" style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: auto; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); font-size: medium; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1990/11/culture2.GIF" height="243" width="400" alt="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-image: initial; box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">The United States is unquestionably less competitive because so many blacks and Hispanics are in jail or on welfare, but none dares say so. America is an increasingly dangerous and disagreeable place because of growing numbers of blacks and Hispanics (see following story), but none dares say this either. It is our actions that speak for us rather than our words. When we choose our neighborhoods or our schools, when we mentally demarcate entire sections of our cities as places to be avoided, we are saying something important about race, but we say it silently. White people have all but lost their public voice.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Today in America, there are hundreds of organizations that speak for blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians, but virtually no one speaks for us. While other racial and ethnic groups work tirelessly to advance their group interests   &mdash;   often at our expense   &mdash;   we alone are not to think of ourselves as a people with our own ideals and aspirations.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Some of us have become afraid to say openly what we know to be true. Others   &mdash;   sincere, thoughtful, concerned Americans   &mdash;   have been convinced that it is improper, even immoral, for white people to think of themselves as a group or to speak out as white people. We believe that in the pages of&nbsp;<b><i>American Renaissance</i></b>&nbsp;these people will find reasons to think that it is not only moral but necessary.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">For though we are still three-fourths of the population, this society speaks and acts as if it were devoted to the interests of everyone but us. In the name of &#8220;equal opportunity,&#8221; America practices systematic, legal discrimination against whites. In the name of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; it sponsors massive non-white immigration. In the name of &#8220;multi-culturalism,&#8221; its schools belittle the heritage that gave our nation its name, identity, laws, and moral foundation. In the name of &#8220;tolerance&#8221; it encourages groups who seek our dispossession.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Is dispossession too strong a word? Fifty years ago this nation was more than 90 percent white. In another fifty years, we are cheerfully told, it will be less than half white. Fifty years ago, the United States had an unmistakable national and cultural core. In another half century, if whites continue to cooperate in their own dispossession, this nation will have no core and no identity.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">We at&nbsp;<b><i>American Renaissance</i></b>&nbsp;believe that for a nation to be a nation   &mdash;   and not just a crowd   &mdash;   it must consist of people that share the same culture, language, history and aspirations. It is in this sense that Norway, France and Japan are nations, and that the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia are not. If we continue to permit the erosion of the essential conditions of nationhood and, indeed, of any healthy sense of neighborhood or community, the frictions that torment us today will be as nothing compared to the chaos that will come. The squalor of Detroit, the violence of Washington (DC), and the savagery of New York City must not mark the way to the future.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">If the American people loses coherence, our culture will weaken and our history will fade. We cannot expect Mexican immigrants, Vietnamese refugees, or militant blacks to care if Shakespeare disappears from our schools or if the Jefferson Memorial falls into decay. We cannot expect people who have nothing in common with each other but the legal abstraction of citizenship to work or sacrifice for the the common good. A nation can be nothing more than its people, and if its people changes, so must its character.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">We at&nbsp;<b><i>American Renaissance</i></b>&nbsp;love our nation and cherish its heritage. We will not be silent accomplices to dispossession. Ours is the culture of Galileo, Newton, Beethoven, Jefferson, and Edison. We are heirs to the spirit of Valley Forge, and the Alamo. It is our duty and privilege to carry forward as best we can the greatness of this legacy.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b><i>American Renaissance</i></b>&nbsp;will speak for our people.

Today, the crisis may not seem so sharp, nor the path of honor so clear, but what is at stake is no less important: the future of a nation.&nbsp;<img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" width="11" height="11" alt="AR" /></p>

		<p>I remember 1990. Back then, the internet wasn&rsquo;t yet off the ground. </p>
<p>The &#8216;voice of whites&rsquo; was limited by paper and ink.  Anti-white propaganda was rolling off the printing presses and into the libraries by the ton, while pro-white essays were not.</p>
<p>The internet should be celebrated as the new &#8216;great equalizer&rsquo;. It has provided white voices with a powerful tool to level the playing field. </p>

		<p>Newspapers in this country will not accept our paid advertisements, that simply announce our name or website. People of color do not have the same difficulty. Newspapers report on the activities of special interest groups for people of color. In fact, they allow and encourage these groups, black journalist associations, ect. into their newsrooms.</p>

		<p>So, for twenty years we&rsquo;ve been talking to ourselves about how right we are to feel the way we do about our dispossesion.  We&rsquo;ve seen an additional 20 million or so illegals flood our nation, drain our resources and cower our representatives from doing anything to stop them.  We watched the public trial of a Black who obviously murdered two innocent Whites, turn into the trial of a detective who committed the mortal sin of uttering the &#8220;N word&#8221;.  The Black was declared innocent, the detective who tried to bring him to justice, declared guilty by his colleagues and his nation.  We&rsquo;ve watched a Black who kept company with a know terrorist, went to a blatently anti-White, anti-America church for 20 years, elected president.  Most recently we see the Black Attorney General attacking a sheriff and a number of states, for attempting to uphold the laws of this country that the federal government refuses to uphold.  Twenty years, and we still ask the question, who speaks for us?  How much longer?</p>

<p><br>
Speaking in a white voice in a white-centric way can always be done.  We can deconstruct the mainstream doctrines.</p>
<p>First of all, everyone needs to move away from the comfort zone of the white Internet ghetto from time-to-time, and into the community around us, and participate in all kinds of projects and discussions. </p>
<p>Then when you are at some event and the speaker (any ethnicity) names, labels, defines, or describes the diverse white American people, you are entirely free to get up and attackback at great length about our right to name ourselves, and utterly reject what the speaker has said. </p>
<p>With any luck, you will be able to bring the focus of any meeting onto the reality of who the diverse white American people are. That can become a springboard for further advances, and denouncing anyone&rsquo;s claim to supremacy to name us is really unquestionable and is the thin edge of the deconstructing wedge.</p>
<p>Hard to believe I know, try it.<br>

 <br>
- Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, November 1990<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
Since 1980 the overall crime rate in the United States has declined. Since 1991 the rate of violent crime has declined.<br>
 <br>
<a href="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm</a><br>
 <br>
Since the Rodney King riots of 1992 there have not been black ghetto riots of any significance. <br>
 <br>
This has not happened because of the success of social reform and social welfare spending. It has happened because since 1980 the prison population has more than tripled.<br>
 <br>
http://goo.gl/KhVpC<br>
 <br>
In addition, the legalization of abortion that began with the Roe v Wade decision of 1973 has caused millions of potential violent street criminals to be destroyed in the womb. Poor, poorly educated, and unmarried females with low IQs are most likely to have abortions, and most likely to give birth to boy babies who become violent street criminals. A potential mugger who was aborted in 1974 would have been eighteen years old in 1992. <br>
 <br>
The decline in the crime rate, and the absence of black ghetto riots have been good for the United States, but bad for American Renaissance. A magazine and website like American Renaissance thrives on a feeling that society is chaotic and getting worse. <br>
 <br>
One does not get places in politics by changing people&rsquo;s minds. One gets places by articulating and channeling sentiments that already exist. Our economic problems create more support for restricting immigration. The failure of No Child Left Behind lends credence to books like &#8220;The Bell Curve.&#8221; Nevertheless, there is little support for a movement that is specifically anti black, and anti Hispanic.  <br>
 <br>
American Renaissance should emphasize issues where it can be successful. It is important to point out that the decline in the crime rate has happened because of more prison sentences, rather than more generous welfare checks. <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, becoming too closely associated with the Republican Party may not be a good idea. The same economic decline that is creating more support for restrictions on immigration<br>
 <br>
<a href="http://goo.gl/Zaf5Q" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/Zaf5Q</a><br>
 <br>
is also generating support for more progressive taxation.<br>

<p>Ah yes, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. I remember them. When I was growing up it was widely believed that even though the communist countries were organized around a tissue of lies, that nonetheless they were so powerful and menacing that they would survive into the foreseeable future. How could one possibly organize resistance when one had to watch one&rsquo;s every word in public?  How could a resistance movement operate when everyone knew that one public utterance against the official state ideology word could cost one his job?</p>
<p>And here we are some two decades after the collapse of those two wretched, multi-ethnic, totalitarian empires. That which defies human nature cannot survive over the long term. It is only a matter of time before PC liberalism in all its rottenness likewise comes crashing down.  Our progeny will look back upon us in astonishment just as we look back upon the importation of slave labor into the British colonies of North America and wonder, &#8220;Just what the heck were they thinking?&#8221;</p>

<p>That is true, yet most Whites, especially White Christians, have been brainwashed into believing we are all &#8220;one&#8221; race in Christ and Whites have to &#8220;atone&#8221; for being born White. In other words, bow down to their enemy and keep turning the other cheek. How misunderstood (on purpose) the verses in the Bible have really become!  To destroy the White race, first infiltrate their churches and their Bibles and the rest will come automatically.</p>

		<p>#4 SS, Don&rsquo;t get too hung up on the fact that Asians, ON AVERAGE, score higher than Whites on standardized tests.  IQ is just the measure of the brain as a machine.  What the individual does with that machine is dependent on their intentions and priorities, and those are to a great extent dependent on culture.  You can have a 16 cylinder Cadillac, and I could have a Yugo.  If you drive while drunk and I don&rsquo;t, guess who prevails in the long run?  We need to worry much less about Asian intelligence and much more about Asian racial consciousness.  As for AM and their merits as a voice for Whites, tell me SS, who speaks better?</p>

<p>The second paragraph seems to nullify the first paragraph.</p>
<p>Bear no malice towards none? No wish to trample the &#8220;rights&#8221; of others? Wish happiness and integrity for ALL peoples? Isn&rsquo;t this what has gotten the White race into the position it is in as of now?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care a whit about the &#8220;rights&#8221; of other races. Let them have rights in their OWN countries, not in OURS. I also don&rsquo;t care a whit about their happiness or integrity. Yes, I do carry malice towards those (others) in our nation who never belonged here in the first place. They are the foot soldiers carrying out the agenda to DESTROY and kill us, so how can Amren even say that second paragraph? I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>

<p>That is true, yet most Whites, especially White Christians, have been brainwashed into believing we are all &ldquo;one&rdquo; race in Christ and Whites have to &ldquo;atone&rdquo; for being born White. In other words, bow down to their enemy and keep turning the other cheek. How misunderstood (on purpose) the verses in the Bible have really become! To destroy the White race, first infiltrate their churches and their Bibles and the rest will come automatically.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do you infiltrate a Bible?  Here&rsquo;s one verse you must come to grips with;</p>
<p>Acts 1:8  &#8220;But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matt 28:19 &#8220;Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them everything I have commanded you.  And surely I will be with you always, to the very end of the age.&#8221;</p>
<p>The greatest delusion many white Christians have is that they forget that Jesus ordered the conversion of all the people on the face of the earth, regardless of nation or &#8220;bloodline.&#8221;  Perhaps they don&rsquo;t forget, but wish to ignore. But these key verses are undeniably present and a large part of the &#8220;raison d&rsquo;etre&#8221; for Christianity.  In fact, it appears from the last line in 28:19 that Jesus will only be with them if they work convert the world - all nations.  The Bible, any version contains the above verses attributed to Jesus as well as many others that support the idea that Christianity was for all races and peoples, regardless of nation or bloodline.  So the definition of the term &#8220;nation&#8221; makes no difference of the intent of the NT.  Whites forget that the world is full of non-white Christians that they themselves, or their fathers created.  Any theologian would be compelled to give that explanation and support the universality of Christianity.  If you are looking for a rallying point for whites, you must look elsewhere, because Christianity is only something many diverse peoples in the world share with, and is not an exclusive identification for Europeans or whites.</p>

		<p>The NT commission to convert all nations to Christianity is obviously consistent with western nations preserving their own Christian faith, which now requires defence against both non-christian mass-immigration and anti-christian ideologies like multi-culturalism, marxism, &c.;</p>
<p>There might be good additional reasons, by no means incompatible with Christianity, for western nations to retain their own identity and cohesion from the unarmed mass invasion and occupation by alien races and languages, even if some immigrants are Christians by faith. </p>
<p>Saint Paul is quoted as saying that the different nations or ethnic groups have divinely-ordained boundaries to their habitations, though this would not rule out missions to convert them, nor the settlement of European Christians in overseas territories either largely empty or immense hunting grounds of violent and primitive pagans.</p>
<p>Those white Christians who almost uniquely consider it their duty to sustain non-white peoples around the globe should also reflect on all the racial implications of this one-way process. </p>
<p>The Good Samaritan parable was not an instruction to Israel, or any other nation past and present, to invite a mass settlement of foreigners, but a striking illustration by Jesus as to what scriptural &#8220;neighbourliness&#8221; to one another really entailed for members of his own nation.   </p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>If I may speak. Just a few thoughts.</p>
<p>I think you are confused. What do you mean by &#8220;universality of Christianity&#8221;? </p>
<p>Do you believe all races should live among each other? Even marry? If so, you are mistaken as so many are today. This is my concern. No one said they cannot become Christian but there is a difference.</p>
<p>Acts 17:26 - &#8220;And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>This one verse, in the Kings James Version, is what some people use to justify interracial marriage. The word blood was not in the ancient manuscripts, but was added to the KJV sometime within the last 400 years. The New American Standard footnotes this fact and its translation is &#8220;and He made from one, every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times, and the boundaries of their habitation.&#8221; The NAS also has a cross reference in Deut. 32:8, and it states, &#8220;When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, When He separated the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples According to the number of the sons of Israel&#8221;. I think the term &#8220;man&#8221; means Adamic man, or those who descend from Adam. The Bible is written about and for the sons of Adam (Adamic man), specifically the sons of Israel, a specific lineage from Adam. The one in &#8220;He made from one&#8221; is referring to Adam, and the &#8220;nations&#8221; mean the subdivisions of Adam-man, or perhaps the subdivisions of Israel-man, regardless of their geographic location. </p>
<p>Galatians 3:28-29 - &#8220;There is neither Jew (meaning Judean) nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s offspring, heirs according to promise&#8221;. And the sister passage is Colossians 3:11 - &#8220;there is no distinction between Greek and Jew (meaning Judean), circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but Christ is all, and in all.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Bible passage is probably the most utilized to justify interracial marriage. If one disregards the remainder of scripture, it makes a convincing argument. However, the Bible must be taken as a whole and it must not contradict itself. Remember, Jesus came only for the lost sheep of the house of Israel, Matthew 15:24. The house of Israel were the racial descendants of Abraham, and God made promises to him. Abraham&rsquo;s descendants were to become a multitude of nations (gentiles), as sands of the sea, and were to exist as long as the stars remain in the sky. What these passages mean is that Christ&rsquo;s &#8220;lost&#8221; sheep are the house of Israel, regardless of their geographic location. And if they were of the house of Israel, then they were of Abraham&rsquo;s seed, heirs of the promise. </p>
<p>Israel and the Jews are the same. God&rsquo;s Laws only apply to the Jews.</p>
<p>This is not true. Most modern day Jews are the descendants of 7th century AD converts to Judaism/Talmudism. They, as a group, are a racially mixed people and partially descend from Noah&rsquo;s son Japheth. Japheth beget Gomer who beget Ashkenaz. The Ashkenazi Jews represent over 90% of modern Jewry. The remaining 10% of Jews are the Sephardim, who are also mixed, but do contain a portion of their genealogy from the old land of Palestine. Their ancestors are Abraham, the Canaanites, and also Esau/Edom. Jesus did not come for the modern day Jews; He came for the pure blood descendants of the house of Israel. There is quite a bit of historical data on this subject, including Arthur Koesler&rsquo;s The Thirteenth Tribe. </p>
<p>Moses married a black woman.</p>
<p>In Numbers 12:1 it states that Moses married an Ethiopian woman (KJV). If one looks at that country today, they would probably conclude that she was black. However, that was 3400 years ago and racial demographics change, just like they do today. One hundred years ago when one was referred to as a Texan, the conclusion was that he was white. Today a Texan is someone living in Texas and can be any race. In 1960, Spanish surnames were less than 1% of the population in America. Today, 45 years later, they are 20% of the population and a majority in some southwestern states. In some border-area towns they are the only population. In the NAS Bible version, the translation is &#8220;for he had married a Cushite woman&#8221;. Cush was a son of Ham, who was a son of Noah, another Adamite – but she was not an Israelite. Aaron and his wife, Miriam, thought this was part of God&rsquo;s law, to only marry an Israelite – but they were wrong. Especially after the dispersion of 721 BC and the subsequent relocation(s), the Israelites connected with and intermarried their racial cousins, fellow Adamites, long ago separated from Adam – but still carrying the special seed planted in Adam.</p>
<p>The Old Testament marriage Laws were religious, but not racial.</p>
<p>The story of Jacob and Rachael proves that statement to be false. Rachael and Leah&rsquo;s people were idol worshipers, but they were of the same racial stock as Jacob. See Genesis, Chapters 29-32, specifically Genesis 31:19 - &#8220;then Rachael stole the household idols that were her father&rsquo;s.&#8221; </p>

<p>Yes, you are correct. But this is a message which is very hard to speak about to White Christians, White Conservatives, White pro life home schoolers etc.</p>
<p>The founder of Planned Parenthood - Margaret Sanger should be honored for seeing what was coming down the pike and Ms. Sanger presented the ways that the message of responsible family planning should be presented to the Black urban population and to general society; it can&rsquo;t be sold as part of some race/class war against the Black poor, family planning is something that helps poor women and society in general.</p>

		<p>Just to chime in on the asians and IQ argument.  First, there are no differences in fine shades of IQ.  Someone with a 125 IQ is no smarter than someone with a 110 IQ, although there is some slight increase somewhere in the 100 to 110 range.  The ability of IQ testing to detect it is unstable though.  IQ testing is best at identifying stupid people and mental defectives from normal people.  It is also good at detecting diffuse brain injury as a person&rsquo;s IQ tends to be stable over time unless injured.  It is not so good at separating out normal people from brilliant people and it fails completely at classifying how smart a brilliant person is.</p>
<p>That being said, &#8220;asians&#8221; who are tested are actually a subset of asians who come from abroad and get themselves into a situation to be tested.  In other words, they have already self selected for college educated and other smarter than average types.  A study of IQ that say, sampled the majority of chinese outside the ultra-industrialized 2% of the population would find very different results for &#8220;asian&#8221; IQ.</p>
<p>The best way to look at intelligence and race is to ask the simple question, who built the modern world?  And, who maintains it.  The obvious answer is white people.</p>

		<p>Four comments on previous posts:<br>
(1) Both British-Israel and &#8220;Aryan&#8221;-Israel theories are refuted by historical, linguistic and anthropological facts, as well as well-informed exegesis of the canonical scriptures.<br>
(2) Such identity cults wrestle with texts implying that nations other than &#8220;Israel&#8221; will be saved (Rev. 21:24) by the new religion of Jesus the Jew (Heb. 7:14). <br>
(3) The hypothesis that Asheknazim are almost entirely descended from Turkic-Mongolian people converted to Judaism, and therefore biologically distinct from ancient Hebrews, was always suspect in terms of physical phenotype (q.v. Deniker, Guenther, Coon, &c;)and is now disproved by chromosome analysis (q.v. Hammer, Redd, &c;).<br>
(4) Genesis is not literal history, since e.g. the present human races could not have descended from Noah&rsquo;s small family and its allegedly &#8220;pure white/ruddy Adamic bloodline&#8221; (!) after a universally destructive flood a few thousand years ago.<br>
(5) The NT recommends the conversion of all nations, but not racial crossing.</p>

		<p>Apologies for a typo &amp; a numerical error in (21) too hastily posted.<br>
Re (22): Black people who have fought or worked for western nations deserve every due credit, but the constitution and character of those nations were determined by white people, whose race and culture, and numerical predominance in their own heartlands, are under serious threat. The survival of these nations requires white racial and cultural revival, whose political expression need in no way injure those members of other races who intend us no harm and who may even benefit indirectly from a western renaissance in the long term.</p>

Thank you for that fascinating article. On several occasions on this website I have pointed out that Social Democracy only seems to work in counties where the vast majority is still white, and I have expressed the hope that Social Democrats figure that out before it is too late.<br>
 <br>
I am confident Social Democracy would work for Orientals. I fear that third world minorities would exploit it the way they exploited The War on Poverty. Although the unemployment rate declined during the 1960s, welfare rolls increased because the War on Poverty made welfare benefits more generous and easier to qualify for. <br>
 <br>
My parents taught me not to hate blacks. Although I have been the victim of several black violent street criminals, I still try not to. Nevertheless, I am not inclined to make excuses for them. </p>

<p>Bravo, Akum!! </p>
<p>As a Jewish person myself, I feel obligated to say here something which is not said often enough (especially by Jews): There is nothing wrong with or objectionable about the fact that Jews desire to preserve our heritage in the Diaspora or to demand monoculturalism for the nation-state of our people. But Jews (or those who purport to speak for us) should not advocate for ourselves things that we would deny to other peoples (i.e. the right of White folks to practice endogamy and thereby preserve their heritages, especially in the countries that they founded and built!). White (or European) people(s) must not be allowed to perish/vanish, for they are the most magnanimous and creative race of people on the planet.</p>

<p>You are both telling fibs. America was NOT and was NEVER intended to be a multiracial country from it&rsquo;s origins and you both know it. Just because black slaves and a few Chinamen came here does not mean they were to be made citizens of this land and to stay here and integrate with White peoples.</p>
<p> The enemies within (yes, even back then we had them) were responsible for that and you both know that or should know that. They have also done the same to our once White Europe.</p>
<p> Lincoln did start to repatriate the blacks back to their new homeland, Liberia. As much as I dislike Lincoln, at least he had the sense to know that a &#8220;multiracial&#8221; America would be the end of America and America would cease to exist. Which is happening as we speak. </p>

As a Jewish person myself, I feel obligated to say here something which is not said often enough (especially by Jews): There is nothing wrong with or objectionable about the fact that Jews desire to preserve our heritage in the Diaspora or to demand monoculturalism for the nation-state of our people. But Jews (or those who purport to speak for us) should not advocate for ourselves things that we would deny to other peoples (i.e. the right of White folks to practice endogamy and thereby preserve their heritages, especially in the countries that they founded and built!). White (or European) people(s) must not be allowed to perish/vanish, for they are the most magnanimous and creative race of people on the planet.</p>
<p>I wish all the readers of American Renaissance a Merry Christmas and would like to say a hearty and genuine &ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; to Jared Taylor  &mdash;  arguably the most noble and courageous advocate for White rights in the world today.</p>
<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>Thank you for these very kind words Jacob. You are a noble man. God bless you and your family in these very troubled times.</p>

<p>WHO were the people they were speaking to and about? All FREE White persons, btw. </p>
<p> Anyone with a pea for a brain can easily see that the Founders and this nation was built BY White men FOR White people. Did they have to literally say White persons in every sentence?  Maybe they should have knowing what we know now and how everything they said and did has been so distorted by people like you. Just like we are now being told that illegals&rsquo; offspring are covered by the 14th!</p>
<p> Do you honestly believe that they came here to lose their lives and fortunes to build a country that would resemble a third world nation in a few short years?  Do you honestly believe they thought a nation full of mixed races and peoples from completely different &#8220;religions&#8221; would survive and prosper and be a good thing for the White race? They weren&rsquo;t fools or idiots. They knew exactly what a nation of squabbling races and religions would bring, did they not? Is that what they fought for?  We surely can see the outcome of that today, can we not? Maybe you like living in your little make believe, all inclusive world and knowing how ultra liberal you are in your social/racial views, it is of no surprise to anyone here.  </p>
