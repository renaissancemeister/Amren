<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45797933/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.TvtsCjWFC8C">Case Closed? Columbus&rsquo; Crew Brought Syphilis to Europe</a></h1>
 

<p>Charles Q. Choi, MSNBC, December 27, 2011</p>

<p>In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue, but when he returned from &#8216;cross the seas, did he bring with him a new disease?</p>
<p>New skeletal evidence suggests Columbus and his crew not only introduced the Old World to the New World, but brought back syphilis as well, researchers say.</p>
<p>Syphilis is caused by <em>Treponema pallidum</em> bacteria, and is usually curable nowadays with antibiotics. Untreated, it can damage the heart, brain, eyes and bones; it can also be fatal.</p>
<p>The first known epidemic of syphilis occurred during the Renaissance in 1495. Initially its plague broke out among the army of Charles the VIII after the French king invaded Naples. It then proceeded to devastate Europe, said researcher George Armelagos, a skeletal biologist at Emory University in Atlanta.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Armelagos originally doubted the so-called Columbian theory for syphilis when he first heard about it decades ago. &#8220;I laughed at the idea that a small group of sailors brought back this disease that caused this major European epidemic,&#8221; he recalled. Critics of the Columbian theory have proposed that syphilis had always bedeviled the Old World but simply had not been set apart from other rotting diseases such as leprosy until 1500 or so.</p>
<p>However, upon further investigation, Armelagos and his colleagues got a shock-all of the available evidence they found supported the Columbian theory, findings they published in 1988. &#8220;It was a paradigm shift,&#8221; Armelagos says. Then in 2008, genetic analysis by Armelagos and his collaborators of syphilis&rsquo;s family of bacteria lent further support to the theory.</p>
<p>Still, there have been reports of 50 skeletons from Europe dating back from before Columbus set sail that apparently showed the lesions of chronic syphilis. These seemed to be evidence that syphilis originated in the Old World and that Columbus was not to blame.</p>
<p>Armelagos and his colleagues took a closer look at all the data from these prior reports. They found most of the skeletal material didn&rsquo;t actually meet at least one of the standard diagnostic criteria for chronic syphilis, such as pitting on the skull, known as caries sicca, and pitting and swelling of the long bones.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no really good evidence of a syphilis case before 1492 in Europe,&#8221; Armelagos told LiveScience.</p>
