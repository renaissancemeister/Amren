			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), December 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A jealous husband is facing life in prison after chopping off his wife&rsquo;s fingers because she began studying for a degree without his permission.</p>
<p>Rafiqul Islam, 30, blindfolded his wife Hawa Akhter, 21, and taped her mouth, telling her he was going to give her a surprise present.</p>
<p>Instead he made her hold out her hand and cut off all five fingers. One of his relatives then threw Ms Akhter&rsquo;s fingers in the dustbin to ensure doctors could not reattach them.</p>
<p>Mr Islam, who is a migrant worker in the United Arab Emirates, had warned his wife there would &#8216;severe consequences&rsquo; if she did not give up her studies.</p>
<p>&#8216;After he came back to Bangladesh, he wanted to have a discussion with me,&rsquo; Ms Akhter told The Times.</p>
<p>&#8216;Suddenly, he blindfolded me and tied my hand. He also taped my mouth saying that he would give me some surprise gifts. But, instead he cut off my fingers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mohammed Saluddin, the Bangladesh police chief said that Mr Islam had confessed after he was arrested in the capital, Dhaka, and will face charges of permanent disfiguration.</p>
<p>Human rights groups are demanding life imprisonment.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was enraged. He was jealous because while he only had a grade eight standard education, she was off to college to pursue higher studies,&rsquo; said Mr Saluddin.</p>
<p>Ms Akhter says she is learning to write with her left hand and is determined to resume her studies. She is now back at her parent&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The attack is the latest in a series of acts targeting educated women in the Muslim-majority company.</p>
<p>In June, an unemployed man gouged out the eyes of his wife, an assistant professor at Dhaka University, apparently because he could not stand her pursuing higher studies at a Canadian University.</p>

		<p>This sounds alot like American blacks and mestizos who are enraged when a prospective &#8220;gangsta&#8221; in the neighborhood turns away from the gang&rsquo;s demands to keep up with the education. I believe the word that blacks use to associate educated blacks is &#8220;oreo&#8221;, or &#8220;sellout&#8221;, because you wouldn&rsquo;t want to appear smart, now would you? Ironically it is exactly the same mentality that the slavemasters and colonialists had to keep the oppressed people down. So go ahead and keep trashing education, gangstas, because you really are doing the work for your supposed &#8220;enemies&#8221;. Now that in itself tells you of the low IQ in action. Or in this case, inaction. </p>
<p>But on the other side of this argument, how can Americans in general (White Americans) continue to vote for corporate interests who care nothing about education, environment, high wages, workers&rsquo; rights and important issues that the middle class deals with every day. But hey, those Republicans won&rsquo;t tax GE or Wal-Mart, or ConAgra, or Monsanto, or Exxon- Mobil. That makes you feel better, right? Yeah because businesses have really gone out and created a whole lot of jobs for Americans in the last ten years while their profits have ballooned to all time records, right? Sarcasm inserted. Not that voting for the hater Obama and his crony Holder, but the right wing offers nothing in return.</p>

		<p>Well, what we have here is a wonderful example of multiculturalism.  While this exotic act of marital interchange might not fit the European model, who are we to make judgements.  This act should be celebrated and we should encourage more of it.  Whites should celebrate an annual Hack Your Wife&rsquo;s Fingers Off Day to demonstrate openness to &#8220;the other&#8221; in our midst.  This would create a welcoming atmosphere of tolerance.</p>
<p>And to all those bigots out there condemning this act of unique cultural expression, I say beware or there will be a complaint and criminal prosecution for intolerance.  As a white person, I am ashamed that we don&rsquo;t have a cultural heritage of wife finger hacking.  I guess whites are a backward race!</p>

		<p>One wonders how many times this kind of barbaric practice is committed in their native country while their own government looks the other way. It&rsquo;s only because this was committed in the West that it was punished. But isn&rsquo;t this a form of imposing our own moral values on other cultures? What happened to &#8220;celebrating cultural diversity?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Is this another occasion to celebrate diversity? If our Progressive fellows don&rsquo;t think it is, then, what do they call it? When does the cascade of aberrations and anomalies cause them cognitive dissonance? When do we declare &#8220;cultural relativisim&#8221; a destructive lie?  When do we affirm without qualification our culture, values, and history? When do we defend not only our way of life, but our territories, our property, and ourselves?  </p>

		<p>As of now I am enrolled in a degree program. There are women, including professors, who have the perpetual victim mentality and have a real ax to grind with men. Women in the United States have many freedoms and are not &#8220;opressed&#8221;. <br>
Stories like this makes said women look foolish and ignorant. <br>
They have no idea what real opression is. One woman stated when we were talking about such atrocities that she will stand up for womens rights anywhere in the world. A few other women pointed out that if she did, especially in the arab countries, they would kill her. <br>
She said nothing. </p>

		<p>Horrible. I&rsquo;m still waiting to hear the howls of outrage against this kind of Islamic savagery from the feminist sisterhood. No, they&rsquo;re too busy whining about the perceived &#8216;glass ceiling&rsquo; and their &#8216;right&rsquo; to kill their babies to notice the written and re-stated genuinely misogynistic doctrines and practices of the religion of peace. Perhaps they don&rsquo;t want to tarnish their cultivated image as enthusiastic worthy little multiculturalists. Either that or they&rsquo;re simply too scared to challenge a real enemy that might actually do physical harm. It&rsquo;s easier to just carry on abusing soft targets, nice white men too cowed to even talk back. Disgusting hypocrites.</p>

		<p>What a horrific story. Of course, this is all George Harrison&rsquo;s fault. If he didn&rsquo;t put on the Bangladesh concert then maybe Islam&rsquo;s parents would have died of starvation and Islam wouldn&rsquo;t have been born to a life of finger chopping. I knew there was a white guy to blame somewhere in this story. Sad really.</p>

		<p>Every woman in the US (and Europe) who takes a &#8220;Women&rsquo;s Studies&#8221; class should have to take a trip to the Middle East. Not the somewhat metropolitan areas, but the backwoods where they practice the Simon Pure Islam of 700 AD. Granted, our European ancestors in 700 AD would not have dealt too well with Grand Theft (Horse), arson, murder, or similar crimes. But given the choice between the two groups, I would cast my lot with my Pict and Gael brethren. </p>
<p>The women who served with me in the Middle East quickly found out that &#8220;Dorothy, we are no longer in Kansas&#8221;. If a little reality doesn&rsquo;t knock a little sense into the raging feminists, nothing will. </p>

		<p>The story is confusing.  Did the mayhem take place in England or Banglasesh?  It said he was on leave from his job in the Emirates.  It said these attacks take place in Bangladesh on women pursuing education.</p>
<p>He faces life in prison.  The English laws provide only a few years for murder and 1st degree manslaughter. Assault and battery with great bodily injury is only about a year in England.</p>
<p>So I think this happened in Bangladesh.  I doubt there are life sentences in England for anything.</p>

		<p>Muslim men are very jealous, insecure and immature. Many get married through arranged marriages and could never land a wife otherwise. They subconsciously know this. They want their women as ignorant and backward as possible. Educated literate and intelligent women would never tolerate the dictates Islam imposes on women. It is essentially gender slavery and apartheid. Women&rsquo;s rights and gender equality and Islam are mutually exclusive. Feminists should oppose Muslim immigration above all else if they value their rights in western society. But they are seemingly indifferent to it. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right.  But instead, Official Feminism is opposed to the &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; of pointing out the blatant chauvinism and sexism of traditional Islam.  Further, Official Feminism states that to the extent Islam is blatantly chauvinist and sexist, it is because the practitioners of Islam are misunderstanding Islam.  Ergo, if they started understanding Islam correctly, and everyone in the whole world for that matter would get Islam &#8220;right,&#8221; and implicitly, convert to this &#8220;true Islam&#8221; which nobody has yet found, then the world would be a Feminist paradise because &#8220;true Islam&#8221; is supposedly a boon to feminism and women&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>BTW, why do so many people misinterpret Islam?  What of Islam makes it so subject to misinterpretation by the majority of its adherents?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Official Feminism is opposed to the &ldquo;Islamophobia&rdquo; of pointing out the blatant chauvinism and sexism of traditional Islam. Further&#8221;</p>
<p>Never forget that before official feminism called itself feminism it was simply the women&rsquo;s division of the communist party.  From 1910 right up to 1975 official feminism defended black rapists of  White women. The Scottsboro Boys, Emmet Till and thousands of others did indeed rape White women.</p>
<p>If you look at every case back to 1910, it was always White rich communist women who most active in defending black on White rapists.  I remember one case in Michigan from the 1940&rsquo;s.  A high school boy and girl got into their parked car after a movie.  A black rapist tied up the boy and raped the girl.  </p>
<p>Communist feminazis all over the county rallied to his defense claiming that the virgin girl was so overwhelmed by this lovely example of black virility that she gladly consented to sex. </p>
<p>In fact, it was largely the communist feminists who were responsible for the changes in rape trials after 1910.  After the communist feminists propaganda efforts, all a rapist had to do was claim that the woman consented and he got off.</p>
<p>The black on White rape thing was so twisted and distorted by the communist feminists that from 1960 to about 1978 many counties just did not prosecute black on White rape because the prosecutors knew that the black rapist and his amen corner of White communists would escape conviction on the to kill a mocking bird grounds of &#8220;all White women want any disgusting slug of a black man who just happens along and will do him in the bushes behind the bus stop or whereever they happen to meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feminazis did not turn against rape until 1975.  That was when they went on their great crusade.  Their motivation was not against the criminal rapists, but to denigrate the White largely male prosecutors and attorneys who arrested and prosecuted the rapists.</p>

		<p>According to Sharia a thief is subject to the amputation of his hand. Shouldn&rsquo;t he suffer that fate . Didn&rsquo;t he steal that poor girl&rsquo;s fingers. OH right. She&rsquo;s only a woman. I hope his &#8220;life&#8221; in prison ends up in death in prison.</p>
<p>I really feel sorry for Muslim women. They need to start whacking abusive husbands while they&rsquo;re asleep. IF they eliminate enough of them they&rsquo;ll strain the resources of the Sharia justice system.<br>
 <br>
The women hopefully will some day be the ones to turn this insanity around. </p>
