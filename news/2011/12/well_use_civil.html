<h1>We&rsquo;ll Use Civil Disobedience if Needed to Oppose Detroit Emergency Manager, Coalition Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Neavling, Detroit Free Press, December 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson joined a coalition of pastors, civil-rights leaders and elected officials today in Detroit to pledge strong opposition  &mdash;  including civil disobedience, if necessary  &mdash;  against the state&rsquo;s new emergency manager law. </p>
<p>Jackson and others likened emergency managers to dictators who wipe out the democratic process with unilateral authority to gut union contracts, sell cherished assets and slash essential services. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are prepared to go from education, mobilization, litigation, legislation, demonstration and civil disobedience,&#8221; Jackson said during a press conference at Bethany Baptist Church on the city&rsquo;s west side. &#8220;We want a positive commitment to restoring democracy and economic justice for all citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The coalition acknowledged the city was in a crisis but didn&rsquo;t offer financial solutions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are prepared to utilize all of the measures afforded to us citizens to protect democracy,&#8221; said David Bullock, president of the Michigan Chapter of the Rainbow Coalition, a civil-rights group led by Jackson. &#8220;We aren&rsquo;t going to take it any longer. We marched, fought and died for our right to vote. Enough is enough. We will not allow democracy to be dismantled.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Nothing new here. Blacks destroy everything they touch, and insist on being artificially propped up without anyone ever discussing it. While we&rsquo;re at it, let&rsquo;s just continue to glorify them in film and television, as well as re-write their history so that our children can learn all about their cultural and intellectual superiority. It&rsquo;s just nauseating. It would be like living near a &#8220;crack house&#8221; and giving its inhabitants money while cleaning and repairing their house once a week, then, conspicuously &#8220;celebrating&#8221; our neighbors&rsquo; contribution to the neighborhood. &#8220;They&rsquo;re SO smart!&#8221;<br>

		<p>It was black civil disobedience and criminality that made Detroit the hell hole Detroit became.  So the race hustler is advocating MORE of that in order to keep anybody from fixing the problems?  No surprise.   How about we just deny any tax dollars to fixing black problems, and tell the blacks they are to fix their OWN problems without us?  Spend the tax dollars on useful pursuits like border control, higher level classes for whites, deporting third world aliens, and importing white European and South African whites?  How about we get the muslims and blacks and hispanics out of the nation&rsquo;s armed forces so they can&rsquo;t be used against us by a liberal, marxist, BRA run government?  And finally, how about we restore the natural roles of the races?  Whites in charge, blacks working for whites and kept in line BY whites and woe any black who assaults or rapes a white.  It was a far more productive black society back then.  And a far safer society overall.</p>

		<p>Folks, at this point even perrenial leftist professor Noam Chomsky of MIT has declared Obama to be worse than Bush, and to be a disaster in terms of Free Speech, the most important civil right, and the one from which all the others flow:</p>

<p>We all witnessed Jackson stating on television that he wished to castrate Obama, but he has been relatively silent since. I wonder why?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really sad to say this BUT this is all the blacks are capable of when it comes to living in America.<br>
It seems that wherever they are the direction of that area will go down. <br>
They need to admit to their dependance on the other races to live and survive.<br>
They have proven over and over that they are not capable of living on their own.</p>

<p>There were two malls here in Indianapolis that had near riot conditions on their hands with the Air Jordan shoes. A third mall hired extra security to escort shoppers who purchased the shoes to their cars. At Lafayette Square Mall (pretty bad area of town); people literally ripped the doors off the hinges to get in. Lafayette Square Mall is almost across the street from Club Rio, a strip joint. This is where former Pacer Stephen Jackson opened fire in the parking lot after someone tried to run him over. Gee, I wonder what the common denominator is with shoe riots at the malls? Those darn Germans are at it again. </p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s just so sad to me that they cannot just move for better opportunities. I think anyone can see that the Mayor and the rest of city government has totally failed but you also have to lay some of the blame on the citizens. When the Federal Government can no longer pay welfare Detroit will go up like a paper house. I would have moved years ago if I lived there. We need to get out of the freetrade agreements and bring industry back to our own country and if we can get some jobs back that don&rsquo;t require college level aptitudes it will be better for all concerned and as far as I can see the only hope of saving ourselves from eventual poverty riots. I feel neither the Dems. or the Reps. give a damn about the working man and am holding onto my guns and hoping for the best.</p>

		<p>Jessie Jackson is also threatening a &#8220;work stoppage&#8221; to protest the state take over of Detroit finance. But since Jessie Jackson has never worked an honest day in his life, it might be better for him to threaten a &#8220;work start-age&#8221; . I think most White American would sit up and take notice if Jessie Jackson actually started to work at some real job.</p>

		<p><i>We want a positive commitment to restoring democracy and economic justice for all citizens!</i></p>
<p>Since when has Jackson ever been interested in anything approaching democracy?</p>
<p>His notion of &#8220;democracy&#8221; is the type practiced by Fidel Castro in Cuba!!</p>
<p>Jackson once said: <i>Viva Fidel! Viva Che! Castro is the most honest and courageous politician I&rsquo;ve ever met.</i></p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s conception of &#8220;democracy&#8221; is threatening businesses and corporations with boycotts, accusations of racism and outright violence if they don&rsquo;t comply with his demands, fill his coffers with money and award distributorships to his relatives.</p>
<p>His idea of &#8220;democracy&#8221; includes preferences and large settlements for blacks for any perceived hint of racism (or not), <i>We must have a plan to achieve equal results!</i> he asserts.<br>
 <br>
His idea of &#8220;economic justice for all&#8221; is using big government force to confiscate money and wealth from Whites and large businesses who earned it and hand it over to lazy, unemployed, undeserving blacks.</p>
<p>When, oh, when will White America ever say NO to this liar, fraud and huckster and  stop cowering at his feet?  He deserves nothing but scathing contempt, laughter and scorn from White Americans.</p>
<p>Why are his <i>demands</i> always met?</p>
<p>Seems it&rsquo;s easier to throw money at and capitulate to Jackson&rsquo;s outrageous demands than it is to suffer accusations of racism.</p>

		<p>This is where the rubber meets the road.  All the whining in the world by Jesse Jackson and his ilk as well as civil disobedience will make no difference at all when the city&rsquo;s checking account is empty and Detroit cannot borrow another dime.  At that point they will simply have to quit paying folks or write bad checks that will in any event not be honored.  Blacks cannot understand this.  They truly believe there is some magic pot of money out there that will always be available and as long as they are in charge they will have access to it.  Reality is about to sit in and it will be a bitter pill for them to swallow.</p>

<p>The only thing he&rsquo;s interested in making  &ldquo;better&rdquo; is his bank account.  He&rsquo;s made a handsome living playing &ldquo;his people&rdquo; against White society. Still after 50 years, White traitors in corporate American and government still kowtow to him as soon he shows up in the lobby demanding &#8220;change.&#8221; A check and apology is never far behind. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s nothing more than a shake down pimp wearing a nice suit. Too bad he&rsquo;s not treated as such by White America, as they are holding the purse strings that have made this louse a wealthy man. </p>
<p>Trumped up racial accusations can be very lucrative, so long as you have someone willing to pay the ransom, out of terror of being branded a racist! Essentially, that&rsquo;s all this has ever been. <br>

		<p>We have the same thing going on in Canada (on a smaller scale) on Indian Reserves.  The federal government pours millions of dollars into the reserves but due to corruption and incompetence it is like throwing money down a rat hole.  The band leader of one particular reserve, Attawopaskat, recently started  complaining vocally about conditions on the reserve. In response the government sent in someone to take over management, whereupon the band chief threw a major hissy fit.  Her latest gambit is to get the UN involved.  </p>

		<p>The Rainbow Coalition apologists didn&rsquo;t offer any solutions to the economic crises that has occurred in Detroit. That&rsquo;s because not one of them would know how to solve the problem if you gave them a blueprint with the answers. Pure emotion is what these people run on. No reason, no logic.

		<p>If Detroit&rsquo;s blacks burn down DIEtroit, or parts thereof, you&rsquo;ll quickly see federal tax money pour in to build new buildings and homes. It never fails. Our government has always financed black self-destruction, and it isn&rsquo;t about to allow them to live around the consequences of their actions.  </p>
<p>Along with another mountain of federal money given to DIEtroit, you will read how white liberals and black &#8220;activists&#8221; label the looting and mayhem: &#8220;A rebellion.&#8221;.  They quickly romanticize all black riots as such. Someone forgot to tell them that when you have a rebellion, you attack the enemy&rsquo;s infrastructure and population.  Then again, people in white communities will most likely fight back with firepower.  I certainly would.   </p>
<p>Then read about how the &#8220;free money&#8221; (a black phrase regarding government handouts) has mysteriously disappeared, and the planned rebuilding becomes stalled. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a circus of waste perpetrated by our very own government and the people who feed off of it.  And working people again pay for the insanity.  </p>

<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>Blacks are natural born communists. They don&rsquo;t understand how wealth is created and how economies function.</p>
<p>All they see is people with more money than they have, find an &#8216;historical injustice&rsquo; to tar them with, and demand their cut from alleged past racial exploitation and disenfranchisement.</p>
<p>They believe there is a finite pool of money that they have been denied access to because of racism. <br>

<p>So whats not to believe about that? Do you really think that Whitey is going to sit back and allow their noble blacks to &#8220;swallow a bitter pill&#8221;? Really? Heavens no - the White-guilt crowd will BEG their noble blacks to take their money and grovel for forgiveness from them for daring to want to destroy their black paradise.   </p>

Greetings from San Leandro, CA, and merry Christmans. Let&rsquo;s see, there was a black riot over the new Air Jordans at the mall yesterday and another shooting at the local Walmart. My but I live in an &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; city! Just a couple more years and my wife and I can retire &hellip; somewhere in the Northwest. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Jack responds:</p>
<p>Jim there is a real movement of Whites moving away from NW crime and corruption to work to establish a new, White North West Republic.</p>
<p>Google NorthWest Front, or NorthWest Republic  - some of the novels associated with this movement fall in to the category of &#8220;Revolutionary Fantasy&#8221; which includes guerilla warfare against a very corrupted US Federal Government, but the actual movement is comprised of good White people. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever despair that we are &#8220;doomed&#8221;. Our people have lived through much worse and come back stronger than ever. </p>
<p>Communism is over<br>
the Washington Post, the New York Times, Norman Lear and Network TV no longer tell America what to think.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make it through this and build a great future for White children (and also be fair to decent folks of other races/cultures).</p>
<p>Merry Christmas everyone and may all our Christmases be White<br>

		<p>1, From time to time Local (City) Government councils here are dismissed because of alleged corruption, incompetance, nepotism etc, and an emergency administrator is appointed until new elections are held. Normally this action is applauded by most local ratepayers who just want to see the mess fixed up. Civil disobedience and protest marches are not even on the adgenda. Why does J Jackson have such a problem when the authorities try to fix up similar problems in Detroit?</p>
<p>2, I recently came across a somewhat questionable real estate entrepreneur here in Sydney attempting to sell(investment) properties in Detroit. He displays stunning pictures of quite grand houses priced at well less than one twentieth of what a similar property would sell for here in Sydney.</p>
<p>Is there a problem with Detroit real estate?</p>

		<p>I think the Occupy movement has led to these more aggressive tactics by Jackson and others. Now there will be much more political action for the goal of equality of wealth. Expect to see many more events like Detroit. This is a great opportunity to bring whites into the modern white movement. </p>

		<p>  I don,t know seems i saw both blacks and whites drinking and smoking dope on those videos from detroit. Probably what everybody with good intentions should do is boycott everything made in Detroit or based in Detroit. If you become what you condone everybody is condoning drinking and doping on the job by buying anything from those plants. You can go to you tube or just google it to review the drinking and doping. Also that defense plant in detroit.  Harrisburg Pa. is in bad shape financially also, anybody have an update or info on that city like who is running it and who lives there.</p>

		<p>One of the comments on the article on FreeP was great.  Paraphrasing, we should let Jesse Jackson have his desire, and not intervene.  Detroit will run out of money, and will literally have nothing in its bank accounts.  They will either stop sending out paychecks and pension checks, or else those will bounce.  I assume most payments are now electronic so those will simply stop showing up.</p>
<p>Most city staff will stop working within a couple of weeks of not getting paychecks.  The buses will be the first to stop running, as they won&rsquo;t even be able to buy fuel for them.  The police and firefighters might keep showing up for a week or two, but they will also quit at some point.  I guess Detroit could issue IOUs, as California has done, but banks won&rsquo;t deposit those (banks did deposit California&rsquo;s IOUs).  Detroit IOUs would probably be worth at most $0.10 on the dollar.  Workers would not be able to buy food or pay rent with them.</p>
<p>Within one week, the buses will not run.  The lights will be out.  There will be no police service.  Hungry mobs of &#8220;youths&#8221; will rule.  I guess it would end with the national guard being sent in, although this is the one time when I agree 100% with Jesse Jackson, and I think they should not meddle in Detroit&rsquo;s affairs.</p>

		<p>I agree; give Jesse everything he wants by NOT allowing the state of Michigan to take over management of Detroit, with the proviso that the state also not fund the mess that used to be a city.  Michigan should wash their hands of Detroit, even secceeding from Detroit if necessary.  </p>
<p>Letting hostile, dangerous places like Detroit &#8220;wither on the vine&#8221; worked just fine during the &#8220;island-hopping&#8221; campaign in the Pacific during World War Two.</p>

<p>Thanks for the links, I had a good look, its all so sad and those pictures say it all. Would make a good backdrop for an Apocalypse movie! It should also be a wake-up call for the rest of us.</p>

		<p>They can do all the civil disobedience in the world. This will not create any wealth. Those tactics might have stood a chance in the 1950s and 1960s when the USA was still economically viable and cities like Detroit were centers of industry. What are Jackson and company going to do other than fight over whether it will be elected or appointed officials who shall preside over the ruins? </p>

		<p>These are the cries of self-justified thieves who have long since moved into the store they are robbing. Having irretrievably bankrupted their city through inbred generations of corruption, they demand that the state support them. </p>
<p>The only lesson here is that blind greed can and will destroy major cities, and that these people aren&rsquo;t citizens, they&rsquo;re thoughtless rats.  </p>
