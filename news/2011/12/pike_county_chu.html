	                	<p>A church&rsquo;s decision to ban a couple from its congregation, simply because their skin color is different, has cut through the heart of a Pike County community.</p>
<p>Suzie Harville, who is engaged to a black man originally from Zimbabwe, is no longer welcome at the church. Neither is her fianc√©e, Tichna Chikuni.</p>
<p>Some members of Gulnare Freewill Baptist Church voted Sunday to prohibit interracial couples from joining their church. They&rsquo;re welcomed to attend, just not so welcomed to stick around for too long.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s racism. That&rsquo;s what you call it,&#8221; said Dean Harville, who is Suzie&rsquo;s father. He has attended Gulnare Freewill Baptist Church for more than 30 years-a place he has seen his family grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I treat him like I&rsquo;d treat my own son,&#8221; Dean Harville said of his future son-in-law. &#8220;You couldn&rsquo;t find a nicer man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The couple, who met in college, recently attended services at Gulnare Freewill Baptist Church-a small country church about 15 miles north of Pikeville, Ky. During their visit, Suzie sang a song, and Tichna played the piano.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pastor said they can&rsquo;t sing in the church anymore,&#8221; Dean Harville said. &#8220;Then he said, &#8216;Furthermore, take your fella back to wherever she got him from.&rsquo; &#8221;</p>
<p>Then, came a policy voted on and approved by a local majority banning interracial couples from joining the church.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 40 people attend services on a typical Sunday at Gulnare Freewill Baptist. This measure passed by a vote of nine to six. Dean Harville said more people were present, but they wouldn&rsquo;t take a stand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Member Melvin Thompson crafted the resolution but said Wednesday that he is &#8220;not racist.&#8221; Thompson says the matter is an internal affair of the church.</p>
