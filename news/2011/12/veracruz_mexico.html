<p>National Post, December 21, 2011</p>

</div> 


<p>The troubled port of Veracruz, Mexico, lost its entire police force Wednesday as authorities disbanded it in an effort to eliminate corruption and to end drug-related violence.</p>
<p>The Mexican Navy will take over law enforcement for Veracruz-Boca del Rio.</p>
<p>The 900 laid-off police officers can re-apply for their jobs, according to reports, but they must meet higher standards and commit to additional training.</p>
<p>Veracruz made headlines earlier this year when the bodies of 35 people with suspected links to organized crime were found in two abandoned trucks on a highway underpass in the eastern Mexican city.</p>
<p>The bodies were discovered near a shopping centre in Boca del Rio, adjacent to Veracruz. Some of them had their hands tied and showed signs of torture, according to reports.</p>
<p>About 42,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon launched a campaign against drug cartels at the beginning of his term in late 2006. Most of that violence has been focused on the northern border with the United States.</p>
