<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With immigration now a front-burner issue in the Republican presidential contest, a new poll shows a substantial age gap among Republican voters over whether there should be a path to citizenship for immigrants who are in the country illegally.</p>
<p>A majority  &mdash;  57 percent  &mdash;  of Republicans who are 65 and older say that tighter border security and tough law enforcement should be the only focus of immigration policy, with no path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, according to a poll released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, a nonpartisan group in Washington. Only about one-quarter of this group, or 24 percent, favor combining strict enforcement with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Among Republicans who are younger than 30, the poll found, 42 percent favor a combined approach of tough enforcement against illegal immigration with a path to citizenship, while 30 percent wanted only enforcement. Among these younger Republicans, another 26 percent said that opening a path to citizenship should be the immigration priority, with or without tougher enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Pew poll appears to point to a silent but substantial minority of Republicans who could support a legalization program for illegal immigrants if it were combined with rigorous enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 9 to 14 among a national sample of 2,001 adults 18 or over.</p>

		<p>As they say &#8220;With age comes experience.&#8221; I think you can chalk this one up to the simple fact that younger people tend to be at the speartip of the indoctrinated classes. If you&rsquo;re 18 and heading for a liberal arts college, you have two choices: either adopt a left of center view of immigration or find yourself ostracized, humiliated, judged, and called a host of dirty names.</p>

		<p> The only reason that the younger voters are more receptive to an amnesty is they haven&rsquo;t shaken off the programming of the school systems yet and don&rsquo;t recall when Ronald Reagan passed the last amnesty through our screaming warnings that it would lead to the current problem.<br>
 Being newer to the workforce they have yet to experience the discrimination of Affirmative Action and are still naieve enough to expect fairness that the Latinos definitely will not  use.<br>

		<p>As a young reader of AmRen I find this particularly disturbing. It appears that even someone who is tough on immigration (Romney?) is elected in 2012, it will be too late to reverse any demographic damage. Even &#8220;enforcement through attrition&#8221; seems impossible. Young people (myself and other excluded) are more comfortable with the idea of a multi-racial and multi-cultural America, and subscribe to the popular (but misconceived) idea that America is a country for all persons of the World. We mostly have ourselves to blame. The parents of today, boomers and gen Xers, did not instill in their children a proper notion of what it means to be white. Fraternity among young white people, so common among young persons of minority ethnic groups, is non-existent. White people to this generation are simply neutral; without a culture, language, or ideology. This process of &#8220;ethnomasochism&#8221;, as Buchanan calls it, may be so deeply ingrained in the collective young White conscious that real change may by this point be impossible.</p>
<p><br>
I propose that the White American community focus its efforts on cultural, rather than political, aims. White parents and communities should concentrate on exposing young White persons to White American culture, history, and customs to instill a sense of commonality that will be crucial to our group&rsquo;s survival in 21st century America.</p>
<p>If we assume that America is destined to become a multi cultural &#8220;salad bowl&#8221; of competing minorities, Whites may be best poised to survive if their revert to tight-knit cultural-ethno-lingustic communities similar to Jewish Americans. Jews used to be unfairly restricted to certain neighborhoods of cities, and although those restrictions were erased 60 years ago, Jewish Americans remain tight-knit, with a strong sense of identity. I find this a very amiable trait (note: I am one AmRen&rsquo;s PRO-semetic readers).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still pulling for Romney, of course, to be elected and enact draconian immigration reform. But that we must all be realistic. Get the vote out, but focus on your children and your community&rsquo;s children first.</p>

		<p>It is up to the next generation of Republicans whether they &#8220;want to become minorities in their own country&#8221;. The problem is that they have never been confronted with this specific demographic reality. They (young Republicans) probably figure whites have a cushy demographic majority that will last another century, not 20 years as we all know. </p>
<p>We need more Paul Reveres to warn these uninformed young Republicans. </p>

		<p>The discussion did not include a gender or ethnic differentiation. I feel that this is an important omission, particularly for the under 30 cohort. Do young white men want their country flooded with their enemies? If so, liberal indoctrination has been more effective than I thought it was. On the other hand, if hyphenated American men want more of their own kind living in America, that would be as expected.  </p>

		<p>To me, it sounds like the Reagan amnesty Part II.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 21 years old and I believe that all illegal aliens should be expelled and immigration be tightly controlled to ensure the majority of the White people in America.</p>

		<p>Am I supposed to be shocked by this news?  Is it supposed to make me give up and cry in my beer?  People under 30 are left wing on everything as a generality.  Why wouldn&rsquo;t it apply to Under-30 Republicans?  I wasn&rsquo;t as right wing as I was on racial issues as I am now when I was cutting my political teeth, but I settled in on full-on racialism at 20.</p>
<p>Plain words, give them time to grow up.</p>

		<p>I think part of the reason for this age gap is that older Americans are more isolated from politically correct pressure and contact, in a substantial way, with immigrants, meanwhile younger Americans are living in a crucible of Political Correctness and have contact, close contact (such as being friends or acquaintances)  with Jose Lopez&rsquo; and Cindy Chungs&rsquo;. Young people are more likely to watch MTV and other nonsense that has a political edge.   </p>

		<p>Having worked for two decades in education, I am not the least bit surprised by this travesty. When you consider the absolute barage of marxist, anti-white, anti-western, and globalist mind control psyops with which these kids have been subjected in school and by the presstitutes, it is to be expected that they will support suicidal policies. </p>
<p>It is really a terrible shame, though. I consider that the 30 and under set is a lost generation. When it comes to liberty or even the most minor forms of nationalism, you can write the vast majority of them off. They also have great contempt for whites, even if they are white. They will not fight for liberty for Americans and they will not support it.</p>
<p>With regard to the design of the poll itself, it is instructive that there was no consideration, apparently, of repatriation of foreign nationals. That shows that the gatekeepers are still at work. They are still pulling their sneaky, dishonest, underhanded tricks and aggressions against American citizens. The presstitutes are at war with white Americans.</p>

		<p>The teachers and so-called leaders of these young people, and particularly the management level (master teachers and administrators) &#8220;educators,&#8221; are primarily of the 60s radical know-it-all generation of hedonists and sybarites claiming to be high minded moral leaders who know better than all who came before them. </p>
<p>These arrogant sybarites have had a free hand in indoctrinating the 30 and unders. The thrity and unders are the protégés of these arrogant hippies who rejected all traditions in their infinite knowledge and embraced marxism. </p>
<p>I know, I grew up watching those corrupt and undisciplined arrogant idiots. They are not the moral paragons of virtue that their drug addled brains think. They are not respectable and they are destroying our country and our people.  </p>
<p>Please remember that during the Vietnam War and afterword there was a large grade inflation process. It started because professors did not want to fail students who might get sent to Viet Nam if they dropped out. The process of rewarding politically correct philosophy rather than academic rigor also became fashionable. They are ignorant slobs.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t a surprise to me, a relatively young person whose racial awakening occurred after college.</p>
<p>The public school curriculum of my lily-white neighborhood saw to that: deification of Martin Luther King, assurances that all cultures were equal, and a reading list that included &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221;, &#8220;Night&#8221;, &#8220;The Diary of Anne Frank&#8221;, etc. </p>
<p>My college education reinforced the message not just that all are equal under law, but that &#8216;racism&rsquo; is vile and illogical. One professor mocked &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;. </p>
<p>These experiences are not uncommon among those of my generation, hence the foolish stances of younger Republicans.</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. I used to be a teacher. Kids are force-fed a steady diet of &#8220;anti-racism.&#8221; The white kids go out of their way to demonstrate how anti-racist they are to nonwhites and to each other. When a white kid makes any slight remark that doesn&rsquo;t adhere to this orthodoxy (a rare occurrence), a tidal wave of scorn and rejection lands hard on his head. </p>

		<p>Well a certain amount may just be &#8216;programed&rsquo; to spout the party line. Democrats, by 85% at the major dem forums, do NOT want illegal immigration. Its about 15% on both sides of the isle, so this may be a misleading poll. Go do your own on a Dem forum. They don&rsquo;t want illegal immigration, and many support gun rights. And Obama is abandoning many of them now. Its not all bad.</p>

		<p>Well I&rsquo;m 19 from Milwaukee, Wi, and ever since I was 17 I&rsquo;ve been telling people about the immigrants demographic takeover of America.  The funny thing is, the people that agreed with me the most were black people.  But, speaking of this data, I think this younger group doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  The majority of them probably attend college and are in that &#8220;happy go-lucky&#8221; stage of their life where they act like reality won&rsquo;t catch up to them.  I&rsquo;m just glad I&rsquo;ve seen the light at such a relatively younger age compared to these people.</p>

		<p>Amren readers should be savvy enough to know that &#8220;polls&#8221; are nothing but a manipulation. It&rsquo;s like the term &#8220;clinical studies&#8221;, &#8220;research&#8221; or &#8220;statistics&#8221;.  These vague calls to authority imply that someone, somewhere, carefully measured something in a non-biased manner.  The reality is quite far from that.</p>
<p>A handful of people (as in less than five) control ALL media, from millions of dollar movies to 10 second ads and do so in a tightfisted manner with an unwavering agenda of white genocide.  They do this as part of a thousands of year old conspiracy.  Something that is obvious when one delves into specifics of who, how and why but have literally caused it to become a crime (one you WILL go to jail for) in most white countries, to even speak their name.</p>
<p>There are no &#8220;polls&#8221;.  And I highly doubt many &#8220;young people&#8221; who vote (like it matters) republican, democrat or even green, are for a &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221;.  If anything, young people are close to taking up arms for this and a whole bunch of other reasons.  They are far more racially aware than other generations because they have been victimized to a far greater extent by non-whites.  In no previous generation have non-whites felt free to direct overt racism, aggression and the attitude that white people should all be killed.  THAT is the reality.</p>
<p>The author of this has an agenda of white genocide and is attempting to manipulate people.  The message is a blatant, bald face lie&hellip;..we went around and asked people and nobody feels there is any problem with white genocide so you stand alone&hellip;.better come quietly and not make any trouble while we murder you and your family.</p>
<p>They do want to murder you and your family&hellip;.or rather, have non-whites do it.  But you do NOT stand alone.  And most people KNOW what is going on.  Resistance is NOT futile.  Just because something is in print or, *gasp*, is on the TV, does not make it true.  Quite the opposite.  One day this man will stand in front of a tribunal and answer for their part in attempting genocide against people.  Until then, stand firm and don&rsquo;t believe a word they say.</p>

<p>As another young white american(early 20s), I find the idea of retreating into ethnic enclave neighborhoods as simply&hellip; silly.  We can see how well that works now.  Badly.  There&rsquo;s nothing in place that stops the non-whites from moving into said neighborhoods, or simply stopping by to rape and murder.</p>
<p>Nothing short of fully fledged, overtly racial towns and cities would solve our present problem.  Let&rsquo;s face it, if a sizable group of well armed whites got together and said &#8216;this is our town, and you&rsquo;re not welcome here&rsquo; no one could do anything about it.  I&rsquo;m not talking about revolution or anything equally nonsensical, of course.  A thousand or more like minded whites banding together in a small geographical location would be enough.</p>
<p>Too bad there&rsquo;s no indication of that happening anytime soon.</p>

		<p>Poater # 4 - History Grad - said it all and said it well, with one exception. I heard Mitt Romney echo John Cornyn (my Senator) when he said of the children brought here by their parents and are now in college - &#8220;Let&rsquo;s staple green cards ro their diplomas.&#8221; If Mitt can change his mind about this, I think he&rsquo;ll still be the candidate to beat, no matter the polls. Other are right when they say the young people of this country have not been taught the values and rules upon which this country was built. They don&rsquo;t seem to mind that breaking into the US, is tantamount to breaking into our homes. The United States is our home, and they have no right to walk in Our government has turned a blind eye for years, so many young people see this lack of respect on the part of our leaders and think it&rsquo;s okay. They will learn with age, hopefully. </p>

		<p>Americans over 65 benefit from a high rate of immigration because the immigrants are taxed to provide the transfer payments that support Social Security and Medicare.<br>
 <br>
Americans under 30 are jeopardized because a high rate of immigration provides downward pressure on wages and makes it more difficult for them to get any job at all. </p>

		<p>An overwhelming majority of White Voters are registered independents. And than there are the White voters who aren&rsquo;t even registered. It would be wrong to conclude that that this sample of under thirty Republican voters is representative  of under thirty Native Born White American voters.</p>
<p>History Grad</p>
<p>Think along these lines:how to start reversing the process of race-replacement? Start like this:1)0 illegal immigration 2)0 nonwhite legal immigration and 3) a cordon sanitaire policy. 1-3 will with 100 percent certainty provoke a highly racialized anti-white response from nonwhites..which is precisely what Native Born White American Patriots want&hellip;for this will surely racially radicalize milions of Native Born White Americans. At some point in time there will be a very nasty confrontation between Native Born White Americans and post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>Here is the larger issue:millions of our fellow Native Born White Americans have yet to give serious thought as to what they are going to have to give up for racial minority status within the former America. It is the job of Native Born White American Patriots to put this question to their fellow Nativ Born White Americans. Once millions of Native Born White Americans understand the consequences of racial minority status within the borders of the former America&hellip;there will be a full-blown revolt against race-replacement at the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites..I am 100 percent certain of this.</p>
<p>From here on in, Jared Taylor must realize that the target audience is our fellow Native Born White Americans. In his radio,TV, and public appearances,Jared Taylor must confront his fellow Native Born White Americans with this question..no nonesense about a immigration moratorium.</p>

		<p>Whatever they decide to do in this age of not deciding, there should result no shortcut to voting, i.e. full privileges of citizenship. I think we should all know by now that such would be a windfall for the progressives. Therefore, any solution will inevitably be quite political.</p>
<p>Personally, I think we all need to take some responsibility for not adequately enforcing border security to this point. In addition, it is important to support any program to require every citizen to have and present conclusive identification for any entitlement, whether voting or health care or any other special program. Otherwise, one gets a bed, a meal, and a bus ticket.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m thirty something.  Don&rsquo;t make generalizations about people my age.  Yes, many people my age are just as left wing looney as could be.  But, I was raised very similar to many of you wise folks over thirty.  The morals and values instilled in me by my line go back hundreds of years.  Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t need to have a label associated with my name and age to tell you that illegal invasion of this country is as vile as it gets.  Self-serving politicians on BOTH sides allowed it to get out of control in the name securing votes and keeping cushy jobs.  Path to citizenship as a reward for illegal activity?  Not all thirty year olds in this country are ready to hand over their heritage to a bunch of law breaking scoundrels, aliens OR politicians!</p>

As they say &ldquo;With age comes experience.&rdquo; I think you can chalk this one up to the simple fact that younger people tend to be at the speartip of the indoctrinated classes. If you&rsquo;re 18 and heading for a liberal arts college, you have two choices: either adopt a left of center view of immigration or find yourself ostracized, humiliated, judged, and called a host of dirty names.<br>

<p>Maybe, but there are a number of people from the Baby Boom generation I&rsquo;ve met who are 50 and 60 at least now and are still spouting liberal, white guilt nonsense like they were when they were young.  I think it&rsquo;s experience, but it&rsquo;s also the generation and circumstances you grew up around, too.  </p>

<p>I strongly disagree with you.</p>
<p>I still think you can get an education. You just need to know that a majority of the classes, &#8220;Social &#8216;Sciences&rsquo;&#8221; or &#8220;&#8216;Liberal&rsquo; Arts&#8221; are useless, and go into hard sciences. </p>
<p>I can only think of two class from &#8220;Social &#8216;Science&rsquo;&#8221; that have SLIGHT chance of being somewhat tolerable (depending on the teacher although the discipline as a whole is pathetic). Those are Psychology and Anthropology. Although most times it isn&rsquo;t even worth it.</p>
<p>There are other classes in which are important and tend to be free from bias. English is one. Ceramics and many art classes are fun. PE or any Kinesiology is good.</p>

		<p><i>It is really a terrible shame, though. I consider that the 30 and under set is a lost generation. When it comes to liberty or even the most minor forms of nationalism, you can write the vast majority of them off.</i></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t write off that younger generation so quickly.</p>
<p>They are faced with anti-white discrimination the likes of which older folks have never seen.  They are passed over for unqualified nonwhites in college admissions, jobs, promotions, honors, awards and more.  They are locked out of jobs that would afford them a middle class life style, forced to live back home after college because they can&rsquo;t land an entry level job.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think they don&rsquo;t know what is going on, they do.  They are the ones who are forced to face head on overt, antiwhite AA sanctions in the job market.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think they are not going to notice when forced to work minimum wage jobs at Barnes &amp; Nobles for life while wholly unqualified nonwhites and immigrants are handed well-paying jobs.</p>
<p>Some of THE most angry, aware, AA-hating, race realist people I&rsquo;ve ever encountered have been from the under 30-generation.  </p>
<p>First-hand experience is a great teacher and exposer of Marxist lies.</p>

		<p>And just look at the age demographics of any American Renaissance conference if you want something else to get depressed about.  </p>
<p>One way to make the ideas and facts that AMREN is pushing more palatable to young people and to the educated is to draw a distinction between individuals and groups.  Talking honestly about group characteristics and the advantages of ethnic/racial homogeneity in a given geographic area is one thing, fighting for the right to discriminate against individual members of a particular group based on its overall tendencies is something else.  It is very hard to intellectually defend the latter idea, and few educated people are going to embrace it. There will NEVER be any mass support for expelling minorities, particularly property owning minorities, whose only crime is being who they are.  There will also never be mass support for keeping America a white majority country unless those promoting this view support equality under the law for law-abiding minority citizens.  </p>
<p>Frankly, this is good for whites too.  There is absolutely no basis for white racial solidarity absent the presence of some non-whites.  Under absolute white homogeneity, we&rsquo;ll go back to fighting each other like we did in Europe for centuries.  Asians don&rsquo;t think of themselves as being &#8220;Asian&#8221; except when they&rsquo;re living among non-Asians, and the same goes for all racial groups I think.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m 38 and I have relatives who are baby boomers who spout off the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; and other liberal nonsense.  It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re still stuck in the 60s.</p>
<p>I think my &#8220;awakening&#8221; came gradually.  While I was growing up in the Detroit area it was tacitly acknowledged that if you saw nothing but black people around, it was best not to stick around.  I think people know what different groups are like, but don&rsquo;t want to admit it to themselves, lest they have racist thoughts.</p>
<p>My eyes were opened fully when a friend of mine explained some things.  Then it was like, &#8220;So that&rsquo;s why they do what they do!  So that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re generally poor!  It&rsquo;s not whitey&rsquo;s fault!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Americans over 65 benefit from a high rate of immigration because the immigrants are taxed to provide the transfer payments that support Social Security and Medicare.</p>

<p>Wrong again&hellip;..  Americans over 65 paid into SSI and Medicare all their working lives.  The fund would be in fine shape if Republican Administrations hadn&rsquo;t raided the fund repeatedly, and Democrats created so much redundancy in bureaucracies and both in corruption that increased inefficiency and loopholes and allow massive frauds.</p>
<p>It has also been shown that immigrants typically cost more in tax paid services and other non-payment of services like ER use have countered any gain from the monies that their typically low paying jobs provide in revenue.</p>
<p>Republicans like the cheap labor source immigrants represent, Democrats like the votes they typically get.  All of it spells terminal dysfunction in government, economy, and culturally.</p>

		<p>Actually I wonder where the respondents to the researchers phone calls lived. My children are in the 30-35 age group. When one of their peers loses their job and has trouble finding another, they can often be heard admitting that their difficulty lies in &#8220;being the wrong color&#8221; (i.e. white). They know quite well what the trouble is, they just don&rsquo;t think there is anything they can do about it. As more and more of them experience this, there is a backlash against illegal immigration, amnesty and affirmative action building. </p>

<p>&#8220;The teachers and so-called leaders of these young people, and particularly the management level (master teachers and administrators) &ldquo;educators,&rdquo; are primarily of the 60s radical know-it-all generation of hedonists and sybarites claiming to be high minded moral leaders who know better than all who came before them.</p>
<p>These arrogant sybarites have had a free hand in indoctrinating the 30 and unders. The thrity and unders are the protégés of these arrogant hippies who rejected all traditions in their infinite knowledge and embraced marxism.</p>
<p>I know, I grew up watching those corrupt and undisciplined arrogant idiots. They are not the moral paragons of virtue that their drug addled brains think. They are not respectable and they are destroying our country and our people.</p>
<p>Please remember that during the Vietnam War and afterword there was a large grade inflation process. It started because professors did not want to fail students who might get sent to Viet Nam if they dropped out. The process of rewarding politically correct philosophy rather than academic rigor also became fashionable. They are ignorant slobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>I completely differ with much of your claim here. First, I was in college during that time and I saw males flunk out and NOT get drafted.  Everyone with any brains knew what was up had time to join the Navy or Air Force and avoid being drafted into the Army or Marines and be likely cannon fodder.  One old friend got into trouble in town and was given the option to join. He went into the Navy.  HE did not get drafted.  Guys who were worried about the draft took classes like philosophy and psychology, the known academic hangouts of the time, and not demanding for anyone.  The stats on education find that the slide began after 1970 (in California for example).  Second, the complete misrule of the post war period by the so-called Greatest Generation created both the Vietnam War (we were financially supporting France in Vietnam from 1946 on) and the conditions, drugs, (LSD) and supplies that fueled the 60s.  (Use of LSD by the CIA beginning with experiments during WW2 while the OSS was looking for a truth serum went on into the 1960s at universities and in the armed forces, as well as through secret CIA programs that tested it on unaware individual civilians in NYC and SF among a couple other locales(ref 1976 CIA releases of previously classified documents)).  The lying and exaggerations of those in charge made many Boomers feel that nothing the government or even their parents said was true.  They were largely boozers who were addicted to nicotine.  The few who actually did see combat were heroes, but note that the average days in combat in WW2 were 10 compared to 246 days for a combatant during Vietnam.  WW2 servicemen, like my father, were more concerned with the next visit to a brothel than they were about their jobs.  Many women stateside ran wild, and the party was huge.  We have idealized it in films and repeated glorifying, but the real history is not so sweet.  During the late &rsquo;60s, a poll showed that many parents would rather see more casualties in Vietnam than admit the war&rsquo;s failure (as early as 1967-8, similar to LBJ, then Nixon), and loose the false economy that the military-industrial complex was providing.  Nixon&rsquo;s incredible, paranoid and criminal activities while in office led to his undoing and the final proof of the arrogance and thoroughness of corruption in conservative government.</p>
<p>The truth of it is that the Boomers were smart enough to know that something was very wrong with the way the government was functioning and that they were being used.  Many came to see that their parents didn&rsquo;t get it and only cared for their own good times.  But by &#8216;68 a majority of the voting nation was against the war.  Most Boomers were still not of voting age.  When National Guard troops began shooting kids at demonstrations it further proved the carelessness and callousness of those in charge.  It was a perfect recipe for alienating an entire generation.  It is amazing that so many have come around after all that.</p>
<p>The country hasn&rsquo;t been the same since because many leaders did not and have not learned the right lessons, and the CIA went on to new illegal adventures that have caused even more war and loss led by administrations like Reagan.  So the left just became more radical and mythologized jerks like MLK, to the point that an inexperienced black who can rap a good line is voted into the presidents office because he promised a plethora of mythologized, utopian &#8220;changes.&#8221;  What has happened is that the over correction that always seems to occur when the pendulum is pushed too far the other way has created a generation that can&rsquo;t even define what it stands for besides liberal cliche&rsquo;s and a set of assumptions that are destroying them and what is left of the nation.</p>
<p>Yes, the communists were right in their taking every advantage and moving in with their agenda, but the older generation provided every proof that their way was blatantly hypocritical, dishonest, and self serving.  Recognizing past blunders in management is the best way of finding a useful path forward. Digging one&rsquo;s heels in, claiming either dishonestly or ignorantly that &#8220;hippies&#8221; were the cause of everything that has gone wrong only guarantees that it will all continue to go downhill.  Personally, I think there is some virtue in knowing the truth of history, rather than matching one bombastic, lying claim with another, even more obvious one.</p>

		<p>The older generation of Americans created a prosperous, peaceful society that had its zenith between 1945 and 1990.  It will go down in history as a golden age.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately the leftists determined that this society needed to be destroyed in order to create a communist slave labor state.  The started a program to subvert the country by indoctrinating young americans with lies about how evil, awful and hypocritical their parent&rsquo;s generation was.  They were told that their parents &#8220;lied,&#8221; so they turned their backs on their heritage and worked to destroy White America.  Presumably they thought non-whites never &#8220;lied&#8221; or were &#8220;hypocritical.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leftists&rsquo; main success came with the &#8220;boomers&#8221; who proved to be extraordinairily gullible and questioned none of the propaganda they were fed.  To this day these fools continue to believe lies that there was something wrong about 1950s White America and that it must be &#8220;changed.&#8221;  By changed they mean destroyed.  The sixties generation was a destructive generation.  </p>
<p>The boomer belief in the &#8220;evil&#8221; of their parents generation has led to the support of the Mexican invasion of the USA and the support of the ethnic cleansing of whites.  Since they believe whites and their culture are unworthy of existing they want to see it destroyed.</p>
<p>The USA is now controlled by white hating sixties leftists who despise &#8220;1950s White culture.&#8221;  When these bigots finally die off the world will be a better place.</p>

		<p>I am eighteen, eccentric and friendly, social to near irritating levels, and I am a race realist. I was raised liberal, waving the flag of egalitarian utopia. I once believed that the source of all social problems were white conservatives, I once believed that racism was a perversion of the human mind. Needless to say, my views changed as I began living in the city. I was constantly exposed to Africans and mestizos and their barbaric culture. I was raised in a small village that was about 98 percent white. I was constantly surrounded by a culture descended from Germans, Irish, and English settlers. I had bible school (though I am not Christian any longer) in old churches decorated with stained glass and carved pews. I played in Queen Anne and Victorian houses, surrounded by the handiwork of my people. I would stroll through graveyards packed with the beautiful markers of those gone before me, the thick woods around the village untouched and pure. A town where I could gaze upon the night sky, watch clouds, listen to the sound of birds and trees rustling. A town with an old library where I could read whatever I desired in utter silence, save the occasional whisper, the smell of old covers and stained wood filling the air. I could walk the narrow back alleys in the darkest hour of the night and no harm would come to me.  I had taken it all for granted and while I grew up in that village, I spoke against everything that had made it possible for me. Perhaps I deserved the fate of having to live about blacks and mestizos. I am glad I do though, for it has awakened me. Now I am in a liberal college, where we speak often of the suffering of minorities and white guilt is fiercely instilled. I have found that those closer to reality (those who have faced hard times, who understand what it takes to survive) share my sentiments, while those who live in a world of plush couldn&rsquo;t disagree more. I don&rsquo;t have to become shunned or join a leftist culture, I can lie, and I do. I will not allow myself to become polluted or lose my dignity while in college. I will flourish in college, and taking what I know, I will pursue my freedom. I will defeat them at their own game.</p>
<p>I will say this, the one thing that has always gotten in the way of me falling to pressure to join liberal culture, is my education in my European heritage. Knowing how rich one&rsquo;s heritage is, how grand the civilizations were, has made it a treasure I will not give up. History saved me. </p>
<p>My blood was given to me by my ancestors, it is not my own, and it is my responsibility to protect it for the next generation. <br>
