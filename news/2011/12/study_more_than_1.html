<h1><a href="https://newsone.com/nation/tjstarr/half-of-black-girls-sexually-assaulted/">STUDY: More than Half of Black Girls Are Sexually Assaulted</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terrell Jermaine Starr, NewsOne, December 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sixty percent of black girls have experienced sexual abuse at the hands of black men before reaching the age of 18, according to an ongoing study conducted by Black Women&rsquo;s Blueprint.</p>
<p>More than 300 black women nationwide participated in the study and 700 more are being sought to take in the survey by March 2012.</p>
<p>Farah Tanis, Co-Founder of the New York-based organization and co-author of the study, says the issue of domestic and sexual abuse in the black community is rarely discussed and that a sixty percent rate should be a wake-up call to black women.</p>
<p>&#8220;A similar study which was conducted by The Black Women&rsquo;s Health Imperative seven years ago found that that number was about 40 percent,&#8221; Tanis says. &#8220;So that means there is an increase and we need to stop neglecting that issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study comes just as U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) introduced legislation reauthorizing the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) this week.</p>
<p>While domestic violence advocates praise both senators&rsquo; efforts to strengthen the bill, Tanis and other advocates who deal specifically with minority women are advocating for language in the new act that specifically allocates funds to communities of color. More specifically, Tanis and her organization are seeking funding for small community groups which have closer cultural ties to women of color that larger organizations don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>VAWA, as it is currently written, does include language that allots &#8220;grants for outreach and services to under-served populations.&#8221; But no racial language is written into the act. Federal law prohibits legislation that earmarks government funding based on race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Domestic violence advocates say black women should be particularly active in writing and calling their congressmen to support the reauthorization of the VAWA because it affects them more than any other racial group. In fact, Black women experience domestic violence at a rate 35 percent higher than white women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kereen Odate, Acting Director at the Center for Women&rsquo;s Development at Medgar Evers College in New York, says black women are reluctant to discuss sexual and domestic abuse for fear of &#8220;vilifying the black man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Odate says there has always been something of an unexplored history of sexually dysfunctional behavior in the black community that dates back to slavery. For example, Odate cites mating practices that forced black male slaves to have intercourse with female slaves as the origin of shame that keeps black communities silence about domestic and sexual abuse to this very day.</p>

		<p>They had to force black males to have sex with slaves?  Dang, black women must Really look ugly, even though I find them attractive. Which is it? Black men are forcing black women or black men must be forced beforehand? Black men must be getting even from all that time when they were forced. It&rsquo;s simply a political act and once again black men show they are smarter and more enlightened and sensitive than everyone else. . and are fightin stereotypes.  (sarcasm off)</p>

		<p>Blacks always try to claim that most pedophiles are white, but it&rsquo;s a lie.  Black child molestation is far more rampant, leading to enormous numbers of black children sent to foster homes.  </p>
<p>Black molestation also has lower prosecution rates because Mama protects &#8220;her man&#8221;, AKA covers up for the boyfriends that molest her fatherless children.<br>

		<p>This is not news but has been business as usual in their community for their entire stay here in this hemisphere. Here and there some white do-gooder stumbles over the issue and thinks they&rsquo;ve discovered something new. If you want some real blood-curdling reading then look up the subject of female genital mutilation (FMG, or female circumcision) as practiced throughout Africa for hundreds of years, at least, right on through today. Also note the percentages of the female populations affected in each of the countries. Not for the squeamish, you won&rsquo;t look at Africans the same way again. </p>

<p>I thought the white slave masters were doing all the raping of black women?  Funny how white men USED to be the rapists.  NOW, it appears to be the black men that were doing all the raping&hellip;.under orders from whitey of course.</p>
<p>Great &#8220;logic&#8221; there.  Probably the same reason black men sexually assault 33,000 white women per year in the USA&hellip;shame, revenge.  Funny that the study didn&rsquo;t mention that aspect!</p>

		<p>What a bunch of crapo! That is a perfect example of the collectivist approach! There is a problem therefore we need a special law all of the previous laws are innadequate even though they specifically punish this behavior. Give me a break!</p>
<p>With regard to the legacy of slavery, how do they explain the large amount of sexual predation in Sub-Saharan Africa? There are not only all kinds  of sexual abuse and rape there, but sexual abuse in attempts to use sexual magic (often involving some kind of rape, even of babies!). The harm of these 60s radical marxists and their brainwashed moron protégés with their marxist inspired philosopy and talking points is immense. It is really getting to be too much!

		<p>Yeah, sure: black men and boys are molesting black girls as a result of mating practices forced on them during their slavery here in America hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>I wonder what their mating practices were when they were back in Africa?  Probably not so different than African mating practices of the present; either side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no end to blacks&rsquo; claims of &#8220;victimization&#8221; here in America. They seem to curse the day they were brought here.  I know I do.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;Legasy of Slavery&#8221; has amazing mo-jo, voo-do power!   The rate of rape by Black males is exceedingly high even in countries that had no history of slavery   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s how powerful it is.  </p>
<p>Also amazing is that in America, the rate of rape by Black males on Black females was relatively low until the 1970&rsquo;s, when it began to climb.  But that is the amazing mo-jo power of &#8220;Legasy of Slavery&#8221;  it was hidden inside Black men for about 100 years, and has only now broken out.  </p>

		<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s it in a nutshell, black male slaves were &#8220;forced&#8221; to have relations with female slaves. Since when did a black male ever have to be forced to have sex? I guess the black male psyche must have undergone a major overhaul in the last 150 odd years. If they&rsquo;re not having sex with their hand, like the illiterate ex-Detroit school board president, their daughters, a horse, an infant, a corpse, or each other,(downlow), then they are impregnating females of all races, legal or not, at an astounding rate. By any and all means, legal or not. To be a bit crude, anything with a hole and a heartbeat, and maybe not even that. And the blame falls on YT. Of course. </p>

 <br>
- Terrell Jermaine Starr, NewsOne, December 2, 2011<br>
 <br>
If slavery is responsible for black social pathology, why have black crime and illegitimacy gotten worse since the civil rights legislation was signed? <br>
 <br>
The alternative explanation is that blacks are inherently highly sexed, and criminal, and that Jim Crow legislation was necessary to impose as much civilization on them as could be imposed. <br>
 <br>
Arguments against the civil rights legislation read better now than when they were written. Those who claim that the civil rights movement was successful, or that it would be if not for the persistence of &#8220;white racism,&#8221; can only do so by ignoring important facts, and by punishing those who mention the facts. <br>
 <br>
Until it becomes safe to tell truths that are quietly acknowledged by nearly everyone I shall remain on the lam from the Thought Police. </p>

		<p>Yes, but the sexual assault preference of black males is, as always, for white women:<br>
<i> &#8220;In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man.<br>
<i> What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man. </i> </i></p>

		<p>This nonsense about all bad black behavior stemming from slavery has taken on mythical proportions.  The truth is that violence and sexual promiscuity, to mention two matters, are just as prominent in black Africa as in the West.  And very few male slaves were used as breeders.  Sex was rampant on the plantations, and most masters were more interested in stabilizing the lives of their slaves to increase productivity and decrease escape attempts.  </p>

<p>1. Live in boy friend that has just gotten out of prison and has no where to go but the gang has set up a network so that members can find shelter with the welfare mother and her kids.</p>

		<p>As  person who went to a majority black school, I can attest to you this:<br>
The hallway pathos usually consisted of lots of groping and body tackling/hugging of girls.  It was often unclear if the girls were allright with it or not, the black girls just seemed to put up with it, or even enjoy it a little.   <br>
I think this very touchy-feely way black boys have of acting towards their own women tends to flare up and get worse, because they are used to this &#8220;playful harrassment&#8221; game.  <br>

		<p>Everything starts and ends at the time of slavery, how convenient.  Sexual abuse of children and women is not uncommon in any black society if these investigators bother to look instead of blaming others and making thousand and one excuses.  Blacks need to face up to their own dysfunctional behaviors.  This constant blaming and playing the eternal victims do not help the blacks themselves one bit.  Blacks are themselves committing these immoral acts.</p>

This is why  we see so many angry, overweight,crack addicted sexually promiscuous Black women who then bear children who are also sexually abused..Of course males are sexually used as well,but many go on to abuse..One black woman told me &#8220;I was passed around like a basketball&#8221;&hellip;Prison sentences for abusers and classes for victims to assist in healing from this atrocity..</p>

		<p>A wake up call to black women?  How the hell are they meant to stop black men abusing girls?  Segregate themselves totally from black men?  </p>
<p>Only black men can stop attacking black girls.</p>
<p>Fear of vilifying the black man?  Sounds like he damn well needs to be vilified.</p>
<p>I read a call from a black woman saying black girls in the ghetto should be taught parkour by their mothers (a form of running and vaulting over objects in the urban landscape) so they had half a chance of escaping rapist black men.  This woman had given up on black men, calling most of them toxic and Damaged Beyond Repair and advocated black women getting the hell away from them and forming relationships with any other race in the hope of being treated better.  See here: <a href="https://sojournerspassport.com/" rel="nofollow">https://sojournerspassport.com/</a>  She also acknowledges that white male law enforcement is the only thing stopping mass rape in black ghettos. Very tragic.  </p>

		<p>You can take the black man out of Africa but you can&rsquo;t take Africa out of&hellip;<br>
You&rsquo;d think that 10 or more generations of living in Crackerville would have facilitated some sort of cultural shift amongst the &#8216;black community&rsquo;. Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be too pessimistic - in most African countries &#8216;sexual assault&rsquo; as a concept doesn&rsquo;t even exist. The &#8216;chief&rsquo; and his family do what they want with who they want. Period. I guess most blacks, sitting at home in their Lay Z Boy, Bud (or crack pipe) in hand, no work to do, feel pretty much like them good &#8216;ol chiefs musta been feelin! In any case, the state encourages, through welfare rates, fecundity to the max. In a sense you could argue that they are merely acting rationally. If you were a dumb black - and don&rsquo;t kid yourself, if you&rsquo;re dumb you KNOW you&rsquo;re dumb - what would be your best course of action. Keep trying to get a minimum wage job or spread your seed and have multiple cribs to chill out in wid yo hos? I know which I&rsquo;d choose.</p>

I could&rsquo;ve told you that one&hellip;<br>
Keeping hush about what blacks do is important, so as not to &#8220;vilify&#8221; them, the problems their actions cause are less important than that.</p>
<p><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
For example, Odate cites mating practices that forced black male slaves to have intercourse with female slaves as the origin of shame<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think it was the male slaves that were the ones that were forced.<br>
But hey, can&rsquo;t break the general rule, &#8220;black males are always victims&#8221;, no matter what atrocities they commit, there is always someone else to blame for it.</p>
<p>I wonder why the same problem persists in Africa, must be because their ancestors were taken away as slaves and whiteys cruelty somehow radiated through genetic memory back to them.</p>

<p>We Whites don&rsquo;t need to do a thing.  I could not care less and no sympathy here!</p>
<p>Until and unless the government AND media recognize the disproportionate amount of crime, especially rapes, committed against Whites by blacks (female AND male) and address this issue, no Whites should care one whit about black issues.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear any black leaders calling for their people to stop attacking Whites. Hell, the Channon Christian  and Christopher Newsom case STILL has not made the papers or news here on the West Coast; if it weren&rsquo;t for the Internet I would know nothing of this vile, evil, rape/torture/mutilation and murder.  I cannot even fathom what the Christian and Newsom families must be going through!</p>
<p>Put everything into White perspective, people.  Stories like the above get TONS of coverage coast to coast, yet blacks murdering Whites?&hellip;.cue crickets.</p>
<p>And then, predictably, there&rsquo;s this (isn&rsquo;t it ALWAYS about money with these people??):</p>
<p><i>Tanis and her organization are seeking funding for small community groups which have closer cultural ties to women of color that larger organizations don&rsquo;t have.</i></p>

		<p>One thing is clear, white males are not the majority of the offendres who sexually assault, molest or rape black girls and women. It&rsquo;s mostly black males who do these heinous offenses that devastate lives and communities. Rape in particular murders people a little at a time spiritually and mentally. Black males also rape at least 35,000 white women and girls annually, murdering many of them in the most brutal manner. A typical example is the case of a Ukrainian woman who was raped by a black serial rapist and murderer at a Miami hotel, beaten until the rapist was sure she was dead, then stuffed in a large suitcase and dumped in the Florida Everglades. It was a miracle she survived this horrific assault, whose perpetrator should be executed for what he did. Then there is the Knoxville atrocity against a white couple on the part of murderous racist blacks. It does not surprise me that black girls and women are raped, assaulted and molested as frequently as they are, and it&rsquo;s a dire waring for whites the threat black males really pose to everyone, even themselves.</p>

<p>Shoddy journalism.  The first paragraph is specific to sexual abuse, which includes both domestic and non-domestic abuse.  The second paragraph is about domestic violence only and may not always include sexual abuse.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m confused about exactly how many black people in America can trace their ancestory to slavery.  When I lived in a black neighborhood and would have conversations with my neighbors I&rsquo;d ask them if they knew which tribe they were descended from and few people could give a credible answer.</p>
<p>Another thought - how much is welfare responsible for loose moral values?  When a woman thinks of her body as a moneymaker how much of that is transferred to her daughter both in dress and behavior?  (Yes, I know modern feminism insists no one deserves to be raped regardless of how she acts or dresses.  I think we can cast a skeptical glance at that.  There&rsquo;s still that pesky concept of personal responsibility to do everything possible to protect oneself.)</p>
<p>As for the young and defenseless, I am saddened and speechless.  All decent parents do everything they can to protect their young.</p>
<p>White people can&rsquo;t fix this problem.  The impetus for change needs to come from social pressure and sanctions within the black community</p>

<p>I saw a short news piece on FOX News last week that informed of the reversal of the death penalty in the case due to an allegation that the judge made a mistake in admitting evidence.  There is an allegation that the judge was intoxicated (seems he was on some pain meds).  Since the families are loath to go through a new trial, it was predicted that a plea deal would be made that mitigate the death sentence to life.</p>
<p>Who cares if two young, beautiful, innocent, whites are kidnapped, raped, tortured, raped, tortured some more, sodomized in every imaginable fashion, tortured some more, raped again, then shot, burned, chemically burned, going on for nearly 24 hours, with an unknown number of rapes by friends who came and went as the show went on, then stuffed upside down in a trash can to suffocate in agony?</p>
