				<i>Ben Hartmann, The Jerusalem Post, December 8, 2011</i>
			</p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
			<p>
				Interior minister dismisses notion that some Africans are asylum seekers or refugees: &#8220;These are economic migrants.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Interior Minister Eli Yishai vowed Thursday to exert every effort to see that &#8220;the last of the infiltrators return to their countries,&#8221; referring to the some 50,000 African economic migrants, asylum seekers and refugees currently in Israel.
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking with Army Radio, Yishai dismissed the notion that Sudanese, Eritreans and other Africans in Israel have any standing to seek political asylum. &#8220;These are notrefugees, these are economic migrants who want to come to Israel for work,&#8221; he said.<br />
				Their presence &#8220;is an existential threat&#8221; to the State of Israel, he asserted, vowing to &#8220;defend the Jewish majority.&#8221; The interior minister added, &#8220;Each and every one of them will return to their countries.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				The statements come as the government is advancing the construction of a detention center in the South to house asylum seekers and infiltrators and construction of a border fence along the Egyptian border is being accelerated.
			</p>
			<p>
				An NGO helping African migrants slammed Yishai (Shas) for his comments, saying the Interior Minister does not understand the refugee situation in Israel or the tribulations of those seeking asylum in the country.
			</p>
			<p>
				Orit Marom Advocacy coordinator at ASSAF the Aid Organization for Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Israel said &#8220;Eli Yishai, at the Interior Ministry, didn&rsquo;t check any asylum request from the Eritreans and the Sudanese who make 90% of the asylum seekers. Therefore, there is no basis for him to assess that they are not refugees because he knows nothing about their situation.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Marom added &#8220;the government of Israel speaks with two voices, one is the Foreign Ministry which says it is forbidden to return Eritreans to Eritrea because it is ruled by a dictator. The other is this demagoguery of Yishai saying they are migrant workers and we must kick them out. We&rsquo;re tired of this double-talk.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Next Sunday, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s NIS 630 million plan to complete construction on the fence and build the detention center will be submitted for cabinet approval, the PMO said in a statement released Wednesday.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cost is in addition to the NIS 1.5 billion that has already been invested. In order not to break the budgetary framework, all ministries will be asked to allocate two percent of their budgets, the PMO stated.
			</p>
			<p>
				An additional NIS 280 million will be allocated to complete the fence on the Egyptian border, which the government anticipates will be completed within a year&rsquo;s time. A 70-kilometer section of the fence has already been completed. The fence is expected to be 240 kilometers in length when completed, stretching from the Kerem Shalom crossing in the west to the Taba crossing in the east.
			</p>
			<p>
				NIS 250 million will be allocated for a new detention center in the South. An additional NIS 100 million will be allocated to operate and maintain the center, which is expected to hold 8,000 people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Netanyahu said of the infiltrator problem, &#8220;Israel is a small country. We cannot allow ourselves to be flooded by illegal work infiltrators. This threatens our society, our economy and our security. Therefore, we must expedite our dealing with the problem.&#8221;

					They&rsquo;ve spent over 60 years in on again off again wars with the Arab nations that surround them, including terrorist actions and unrest during these times. They now realize they need a fence, to keep out black Africans.

					This is the positive result of actions not dictated by PC dogma.
				</p>
				<p>
					Israel does have the time or patience to worry about what is politically correct. They see their nation threatened and so they just deal with it - PC liberals be damned.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually it will reach that stage in the US but I fear by then it will be too late.<br />

					He is right, they are an existential threat to Israel and they are all economic migrants and they should ALL GO HOME. Do it now or suffer for the next century. I hope Europe will learn from this. Denmark needs to expel ALL their Somali immigrants. They are ALL economic migrants and none of them belong in Europe.
				</p>
				<p>
					No one has rights of political expression or freedom of religion in Somalia so, looking at it from a Western point of view, all Somalis would qualify for asylum. But this is nonsense; those concepts of a right to self-expression and religion are meaningless in Somalia, and ultimately only Somalis can solve the problems in Somalia, and shipping them around the world will not help anything.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wish we would also help our Sudanese and Somalis we have here by repatriating them. They are needed in their home countries, they are not needed here. We already have an enormous and enormously expensive black underclass, thank you very much.
				</p>
				<p>
					Go Israel, send them all home NOW!

					We have exploding populations in the Third World &amp; stupid asylum policies in the First World. The africans just think &#8216;get to where the money is!&rsquo; We are being overwhelmed,but the tough policies needed are not coming forth. The downfall of the west is getting periliously close. Soon the barbarians will wash us away like the fall of Rome.

				<p>
					They are following their kin who made it to Israel in the airlifts of &#8216;84 and &#8216;91.
				</p>
				<p>
					A rabbinical council proclaimed that certain black Africans were legitimate Jews (a &#8220;lost tribe&#8221;), and aircraft were sent to pick them up. Overnight, these East Africans were plucked out of Third World backwardness and deposited in modern, high-tech Israel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much to the dismay of Israelis, the Africans soon learned how to mimic the &#8216;culture&rsquo; of American blacks, introduced to them through music and pop culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					The presence of an African community in Israel has become the bridgehead which draws more Africans, as many as can walk across the border.

					Interesting observation. It appears that Portugal is rapidly becoming a Portuguese speaking Mozambique, Angola and Guinea. They even accepted a Black so called &#8220;American&#8221; cop killer as a citizen.

					Israel could annhilate its enemies if left alone by the crybaby leftists of the U.S. and Western Europe. One day the depredations of the darker races will indeed become too much for any nation of the West, and the reactions will be severe. White-run countries certainly have the capability to crack down on people within their borders, whether citizens or aliens. It&rsquo;s already been shown how quickly and ruthlessly Germany rose from a liberal society under the Veimar Republic to the Third Reich. And this regime preyed upon white citizens who were law-abiding, exemplary members of society, not the problematic ethnic groups that nations are now having real problems with. <br />
					At any election, white people can elect officials who will promise to carry out pro-white policies. If these officials don&rsquo;t do what they promise, they can be turned out next election. It won&rsquo;t take long for candidates to learn what they must do to stay in office. But white people must make their power known at the ballot box.

					Small and large are relative terms. In time &#8216;large&rsquo; countries will be just as overrun as &#8216;small.&rsquo; To me, this is our salvation. The words have been uttered. We only have to repeat them everywhere a million times a day. France is a small country, we cannot allow&hellip; England is a small island, we cannot allow&hellip; The US is not a huge country, we cannot allow&hellip; etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					There&rsquo;s too much talk, too many reasons. This keeps it simple. It&rsquo;s like the guy who found a package of meat wasn&rsquo;t in his bag when he got home from the supermarket and went back and just kept repeating &#8220;I want my meat&rsquo; until they gave it to him.
				</p>
				<p>
					As far as &#8216;electing&rsquo; pro-white leaders - huh? You haven&rsquo;t been paying close enough attention to reality.

					There is a big difference between Israeli Jews and Western Jews. And this is a fact. 78% of American Jews voted for Obama, the most anti Israeli president in US history. Most Jews in Israel preferred McCain. Jews in the West have galut problem (what Jews call it, exile problem) They didn&rsquo;t have a country of their own for so long that they care more about minorities than what is good for the country as a whole. Israeli Jews have the country of their own, they love Israel and defend her. Majority of them have more in common with western conservatives than Jews. We share the same values. And it&rsquo;s a fact that Jews are over represented in liberal and ant white actions so I think the solution is that western Jews immigrate to Israel and learn to be healthy and nationalist. Majority of Jews in Israel and circumstances will force them to. Am Yisrael Hai!

					With all due respect, anthropological studies show that Jews ARE white. I think that people should study the &#8216;human variation&rsquo; aspect of anthropology. It is not politically correct to do so, however. Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t study it because liberals don&rsquo;t want you to study it. They say that there ARE no races.

				<p>
					You make a lot of good points.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, if Obama is the most anti-Israeli president in U.S. history, that shows that there is really very little variation in that support that is allowed.
				</p>
				<p>
					I know that Israelis and American Zionists complain that he is not completely towing the line but compared with the possibilities, and with what I and others believe should be done, and not done, he is quite a lapdog for Israel.
				</p>
				<p>
					He continues most of the outrageous policies of crimes against humanity (torture and other crimes) and he has expanded the so-called war on terror and now claims to have the right to extra-judicial killings of American citizens. Some of those citizens are Arab Muslims who never should have been given U.S. citizenship in the first place but the tyrants here can and will use that power against White American Christians or any other people that they choose to attack in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, the Obama administration has been actively fomenting color revolutions throughout the Muslim world and is currently saber-rattling against Syria and Iran.
				</p>
				<p>
					The power of American Presidents is over-rated. They are controlled by powerful interests and elitists (but not JUST Zionist interests, also others).
				</p>
				<p>
					As for Israelis acting more like conservatives here, I would like to make three points.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, I agree that Anglo-Scottish Americans (the majority of the original non-indigenous Americans) should have been more ethnocentric in their immigration policy (more Israeli-like) all along and then Americans would be happier, healthier, more prosperous, and independent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, yes, there are sociological reasons for it, but Jewish Americans do mostly support what is, in effect, an attack on the White Christian Americans through immigration and multicultural attacks and race pandering and racial aggrandizement campaigns to groups who nurse old, old and violent hateful grudges against people who are long dead (and their descendents) and these Jewish Americans on the whole also support Israel wholeheartedly, including the ethnic policies.
				</p>
				<p>
					They are hypocrites on that point because they overwhelmingly support the quisling immigration ethnic inundation of White Christian Americans and support all ethnicites&rsquo; attacks on White Christian Americans and they lie and exaggerate supposed slights all through the process.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, I would argue that their racial aggrievement projects here in the U.S. are harmful to Israeli interests and the support for Israel in the U.S. It is misplaced in other respects, too. For instance, most of the ethnic project clients of American Jewish organizations are hostile and even violent toward Jews. For example blacks, Mexicans, and Arabs are overwhelmingly hostile to Jews.
				</p>
				<p>
					Third, I do not agree with people who arbitrarily divide so-called liberals and so-called conservatives into two camps which they get to arbitrarily define. I do not believe in the false-dichotomy and false paradigm and I believe that it enslaves people. We have a Janus-headed two party system here. I agree with the ancient Jews that polytheism is not good and I refuse to worship Janus:
				</p>
				<p>
					My argument about the danger of allowing Israeli companies to have control of key security and communications infrastructure in the U.S. still stands. Furthermore, no foreign companies should be doing that, not Norwegian companies, Chinese companies, German companies, or any other foreign companies. But the crux of the matter is that Israeli companies (with ties to Mossad) have control of some key American infrastructures and they are endangering our security because their interests are not our interests and I, for one, am an American first and foremost. My loyalty is to my country.
				</p>
				<p>
					My argument about dual citizenship stands.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another point about the Israelis&rsquo; personal philosophies, I have in the past usually found that I understand and get along with Israelis much better than I understand and get along with American Jews. This is partly because I grew up as an athlete in a very tough sport and later martial arts and I understood and appreciated the sabra toughness. But that was when I was still brainwashed in the Zionist view.

					Assuming a complete descent from the Ancient Hebrews, Israelites, or Jews (terminology depending upon the era, I understand), it is still questionable that after 2000 years (and some argue that the diaspora started much earlier) a people is entitled to return and take control of a land that they once inhabited and displace the current inhabitants (a position that is normally untenable under 20th C. and 21sst C. international law, a time during which this took place). It is highly questionable and debatable, and not entirely settled, that modern Jews are very much at all descended from ancient Jews from what is now called Israel. Most of the studies showing such a near complete kinship have been done by Jews! I argue that they were biased and had a very powerful motive that could, at the very least, cloud their judgement and methodology!<br />

					If you have not yet done so, download and read &#8220;The Ashkenazi Revolution&#8221; from Jewamongyou&rsquo;s blog. For those of you who think you know it all about the I/J/Z issue base simply because you listened to some preacher who lived in a West Virginia trailer park every once in awhile, or you listen to fundagelical and dispensationalist Christian preachers who themselves gleaned over the Book of Revelation, you&rsquo;ll find out that you really know nothing. If you are, like I was, someone who thought he knew a little, but wasn&rsquo;t really too interested in those sorts of things, then you&rsquo;ll find out what little you know is mostly wrong or a distortion.
				</p>
				<p>
					It&rsquo;s a philosophically heavy book, and not meant to be read lightly. Once you&rsquo;re done, then you&rsquo;ll realize that both conventional anti-Semitism and conventional philo-Semitism are both full of it. You&rsquo;ll also realize how banal are the politics of the I/J/Z issue base among non-Israelis, both Gentile and Jewish.

					„The power of American Presidents is over-rated. They are controlled by powerful interests and elitists&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. I think Clinton said that being American President is like steering a motor boat that is driving very fast. You can do only minor corrections on course.
				</p>
				<p>
					„First, I agree that Anglo-Scottish Americans (the majority of the original non-indigenous Americans) should have been more ethnocentric in their immigration policy (more Israeli-like) all along and then Americans would be happier, healthier, more prosperous, and independent.&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Agree.
				</p>
				<p>
					„Jewish Americans do mostly support what is, in effect, an attack on the White Christian Americans through immigration and multicultural attacks and race pandering and racial aggrandizement campaigns to groups who nurse old, old and violent hateful grudges against people who are long dead (and their descendents) and these Jewish Americans on the whole also support Israel wholeheartedly, including the ethnic policies.&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					I think that situation is more complex. There are big differences between Jews in Israel and in the West. Most American Jews can&rsquo;t comprehend why can&rsquo;t Israeli Jews live in peace with Arabs. There is a great divide. For instance the debate between Alan Dershowitz and Noam Chomsky. One defends Israel and other attacks her but both are Jews. In Israel opinions go from expel all Palestinians to expel all Jewish settlers (left wing Haaretz calls Israeli settlers fascist state).
				</p>
				<p>
					„In fact, I would argue that their racial aggrievement projects here in the U.S. are harmful to Israeli interests and the support for Israel in the U.S. It is misplaced in other respects, too. For instance, most of the ethnic project clients of American Jewish organizations are hostile and even violent toward Jews. For example blacks, Mexicans, and Arabs are overwhelmingly hostile to Jews.&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course. By this example you could see how liberalism is mental diseases. American Jews, majority, works against White America who is most supportive of Israel (there is a saying America&rsquo;s Bible Belt is Israel safety belt) and promote minorities that are more antisemitic and couldn&rsquo;t care less of Israel. And Jews. The only pogrom in modern American history of Jews was committed by blacks in Crown Heights. And yet Jews want to help blacks against whites in spite that white majority defend them from black violence. The same thing is in Europe. Jews are biggest proponents of multiculturalism and Muslim immigration and anti Jewish attack rise in connection with Muslim immigration.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://goo.gl/cq7H" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/cq7H</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					look at this. And yet the leaders of NGO that promote muslim immigration are Jews.
				</p>
				<p>
					„Third, I do not agree with people who arbitrarily divide so-called liberals and so-called conservatives into two camps&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					I made this divide only to exclude about 20% of crazy liberals. And majority of Jews fall into that category. I think Rasmussen Reports gives better division between Mainstream and Political class (liberals). So 60-70% of American agree on some issue vs. 20% of liberals who promote harmful policies.

					Agree on a lot of points. But I think that Israelis have „ius belli&ldquo; (law of the sword). They took their piece of the land by force. Every other nation on earth have done the same. They only did that latter so consequences are felt.

					We are mostly in agreement on a lot of points but probably not on the main point. As to the ius belli, the Israelis had a lot of help and didn&rsquo;t do it themselves and it was quite ill advised and is the most pernicious and destructive problem on earth. It is destroying my country and I do not agree with U.S. policies toward Israel. For me and other Americans, the well-being of our country is the top priority.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the bible-belt, those people are quite misguided. They seem to hope for Armageddon (at Har Megiddo?) and some have openly stated that they support foreign policy which will, in their minds bring it about. They might bring it about but it could be argued that it is sacrilege to try to push God&rsquo;s hand, so to speak. That is the way of things because the most important gift that God has given us is free-will. In fact, it is impossible to choose salvation without free will. They have the free-will to decide the course of their destiny. The real irony is that most of them dislike Jews and believe that Jews are condemned to eternal punishment. Some of the older Israelis might correctly describe them as mashugana . A crazy man is a poor ally.
				</p>
				<p>
					As per your metaphor of the safety belt: a frayed safety belt that is coming apart at the seams is not a dependable safety belt. In fact, a better metaphor for the Bible-Belt alliance would be the situation that you might get by adding sugar to your gas-tank. You will get a temporary wild-ride but in the end you have destroyed the car and you will not have the advantage of the use of that car. That car will no longer get you where you want to go. That is a short-sighted policy.

					You have confirmed what I have always thought just as a result of pure common sense that Israeli attitudes towards American Christian dispensationalists and millenarians, mainly in the Deep South, would be. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re glad for the help, but then they wonder, at what cost? What&rsquo;s the catch?
				</p>
				<p>
					I know that Israelis get really nervous when the fundagelicals actually come to visit. Most will visit just for the history and the spiritual calling, but they always have to worry about the rogue nutcase who &#8220;just can&rsquo;t wait for Christ to come back&#8221; so they try and stir stuff up.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most Christians in the world, and even a majority in the United States, interpret Revelation in the spiritual-historical plain, not a book foretelling future prophecy of a Second Coming. I actually sort of resent the dispensationalists getting all the media face time, they&rsquo;re giving us a bad reputation. As such, most Christians feel no spiritual or other need to be &#8220;Pro-Israel&#8221; (a vacuous and meaningless phrase if there ever was one, but I&rsquo;ll get to that another time.) I know the guilty party, his name is John Nelson Darby. But just how did dispensationalism and millenarianism catch on among American Christians and none other? I&rsquo;ll never know.
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally, I wish every copy of the Book of Revelation would disappear today. That&rsquo;s not up to me, though.

					„the Israelis had a lot of help and didn&rsquo;t do it themselves&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Not in 1948, they took their part of the land with very little help.

					„It is destroying my country and I do not agree with U.S. policies toward Israel. For me and other Americans, the well-being of our country is the top priority.&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course. As a European it is unbelieving how America is behaving towards Israel. In lot of occasions America and Israel stands against all other nations. So you wonder why are american patriots caring so deeply for some small desert nation in the Middle East.
				</p>
				<p>
					„That is a short-sighted policy.&ldquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Agree. But Israelis are already working to make alliance or friendlier relations with China and India. They too see wtah is happening. But in the entire history relation between superpower and small country like Israel is unique. I don&rsquo;t know for such example.<br />

					We are in complete agreement on that, too. There are a lot of people who identify themselves as liberal and who allow themselves to be pidgeonholed and follow a prescribed path and who are quite mentally ill. They are especially insane and illogical in their anti-white racism and their espousal of issues of aggrievment and preferences for other races or ethnicities and their attacks on whites. We have a phrase to describe them: &#8220;Benedict Arnold.&#8221;
