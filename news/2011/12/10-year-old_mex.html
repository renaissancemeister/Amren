<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 10-year-old Mexican girl has given premature birth to a baby boy weighing 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds), Mexican media outlets reported.</p>
<p>The mother was initially admitted to Hospital de la Mujer in Puebla, located about 60 miles southeast of Mexico City, on Oct. 22, suffering from seizures and other medical problems. Surgeons at the hospital delivered the infant by Caesarean section after a 31-week pregnancy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hospital director Rogelio Gonzalez told The Latin American Herald Tribune that the child is in the neonatal intensive care unit, recovering from pneumonia. The mother, who has since been released, has been breastfeeding the child.</p>
<p>&#8220;[She] comes every day with her mother to breastfeed her son every four hours and she is recovering very well from her surgery,&#8221; Gonzalez said.</p>
<p>The young girl, who is almost 11 years old, is reportedly from the San Francisco Totimehuacan community. According to Gonzalez, the state&rsquo;s minimum age of consent is 12 and abortion is illegal unless the mother was the victim of a sexual assault. {snip}</p>

		<p>Not all girls look their age. Age 10 is too young by 2 or 3 years. I can see the difference in character between my great grandfather&rsquo;s generation who married 13 year old girls at 16 compared to my grandfather&rsquo;s when it was 16 for girls, 19 for guys compared to my father&rsquo;s generation who, in their mid-20s married adult women. The case of this 10 year old girl is rooted in deviance and promiscuity but early teen marriage in a traditional culture has better results than late teen or adult marriage.</p>

		<p>The state&rsquo;s minimum age of consent is &#8220;12 years old.&#8221; Think about that for a moment, and then think about the folderol we&rsquo;re expected to believe, that these people can shed their values and adopt ours as quickly as a snake sloughing off its yearly skin.</p>
<p>At least, however, she gave birth in Mexico. That is one less anchor weighing around our collective necks.</p>

*****************<br>
This being Mexico, I don&rsquo;t suppose there is any such thing as statutory rape, where a child under the age of consent is raped, whether she is coerced or seduced into saying &#8220;yes&#8221; or not. <br>
I have no doubt she was suffering from seizures and other medical problems. A ten year old is not fully physically developed enough to bring a healthy infant into the world. This child is lucky to be alive  &mdash;  well, both children actually, but I originally meant the older child, the ten year old. <br>
Of course you know our so-called government thinks it is  just wonderful to bring these people into our country to victimize American children, and impregnate our daughters and granddaughters at the age of ten. They have such wonderful family values and such a vibrant culture, don&rsquo;t you know? </p>

		<p>Poor child-no doubt she was the victim of an assault. Early pregnancies and marriages are common in that culture, often with tragic results. My grandmother worked with a Mexican woman whose daughter got pregnant at age 15. The father was here illegally so he then had his ticket to stay in the US. Two more kids, beatings and other abuse soon followed and by the time she was 21 she decided to leave and take her children, the youngest being only a few weeks old. The husband tracked her down, pulled her into the front yard holding her baby and shot her. He then committed suicide. </p>

		<p>They mature at an earlier age, and mature faster and more so when they do.</p>
<p>And everyone is correct, this is not necessarily illegal in Mex. There was this chase across the U.S. a few years ago when this Mex girl of eleven or twelve years was thought be in danger of child molestation. When it was found that she was married to her Mexican teenage boyfriend, the chase was called off.</p>
<p>&#8220;A ten year old is not fully physically developed enough to bring a healthy infant into the world&#8221;</p>
<p>This is correct too! The girl will probably have injured private parts and only with great difficulty will give birth in the future if at all!</p>

		<p>The age of consent in Mexico is 12 ONLY if your partner is between 12 and 17. Adults, aged 18 and over, cannot legally have sex with 12 year olds in Mexico.</p>
<p>These laws were created so that police don&rsquo;t have to send young teenagers to a youth detention centre, and this kind of legislation is known colloquially as &#8216;Romeo and Juliet Laws&rsquo; as Juliet was only 13 in the Shakespearian story, and Romeo is assumed to be a few years older.</p>
<p>Mexico isn&rsquo;t alone with laws like this, for example Texas has a law that under age sex is not a criminal offence as long as the two individuals have no more than a three year age difference between them.</p>

		<p>Back in the 70&rsquo;s A guy I worked with met me at a bar and brought along a girl &hellip;We sat for a couple of hours at the bar drinking..The next day he told me the girl was 11 years old, I freaked out !  I  ]believe genetics and all the hormones that are being pumped into milk, meat and God only knows what else have something to do with these young people aging prematurely.</p>

		<p>This is truly shocking. I must point out a few things, however, about the culture in which this happened. In most parts of rural Mexico and almost anywhere in Mexico outside of the big cities, an extremely male-dominant, male-oriented way of living and thinking persists. From a very early age, girls and young women are taught and told that their boyfriends and/or husbands come first and are #1 and that they should (or must) defer to their husbands in EVERYTHING  &mdash;  only then can they be considered &#8220;proper&#8221; women. Unfortunately, this way of living and thinking not only invites but condones domestic violence. Many Mexican women who suffer from domestic violence (verbal, physical, emotional or all three) are terrified of telling local law enforcement agencies because they KNOW that nothing will happen to their abuser/tormentor unless he has done something truly bad. In this culture, many men feel that since they are the ones who work outside of the home, make most (or all) of the money, and literally feed and clothe their women and kids, the women should be grateful and not complain as well as be subservient. As shocking as it may seem, whenever a girl or woman is courageous enough to accuse a man of rape, she only stands a chance at getting the police and the prosecution only if she had a reputation as a &#8220;chaste&#8221; woman prior to the attack  &mdash;  otherwise, forget it.</p>

		<p>The fact that the girl was mature enough to ovulate, conceive and bear a child means that she had been molested on a regular basis at least several times a month if not more for a year or more.</p>
<p>She did not mature unusually early and then be molested.  She was first molested regularly for a long period which stimulated premature puberty which enabled her to conceive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regular sexual molestation on a girl over the age of 5 or 6 prematurely stimulates hormones.  So puberty starts several years earlier than would be normal.</p>
<p>Any 6 to 10 year old girl molested regularly for a period of  a year will mature prematurely.  The rapist was not some random stranger, he was a person who had daily access to her, father, grandfather, brother, roommate, uncle.</p>

		<p>Hispanic family values at it&rsquo;s finest. Hispanic men are overrepresented among pedophiles. I know most men arrested for having sex with children here in California are Hispanic, usually illegal immigrants.</p>
