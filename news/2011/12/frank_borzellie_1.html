			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Kerwick, BeliefNet, December 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Frank Borzellieri was the principal of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a predominantly black and Hispanic Catholic elementary school located in the Bronx, New York.  This past summer, in spite of having had a stellar record during his tenure, Borzellieri was abruptly terminated from the office that he held for two years.</p>
<p>Unlike those sexually abusive priests who the Church harbored for decades, Borzellieri is not guilty of any crime.  In fact, he isn&rsquo;t so much as suspected of having engaged in any criminal activity whatsoever.  Nor is it the case that Borzellieri, a committed Catholic, was deemed to have deviated from Our Lady of Mount Carmel&rsquo;s Catholic mission. </p>
<p>Still, Borzellieri was judged, and justly, of holding quite heterodox views.  But the orthodoxy from which he deviated is not that of Catholicism, but that of &#8220;Political Correctness.&#8221; </p>
<p>Borzellieri, you see, dared to defy the conventional dogma on race.  For this, he was essentially branded a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; by the New York Daily News and fired by the Archdiocese of New York.  In early August of this year, the Archdiocese of New York released a statement in which it said that Borzellieri&rsquo;s views were &#8220;incompatible with the philosophy and practices of Our Lady of Mount Carmel School, and with Catholic schools throughout the archdiocese.&#8221;</p>
<p>Borzellieri, I hope to show, is up against an immovable object, on the one hand, and an irresistible force, on the other.  It is with the twin titans of Idiocy and Cowardice that he has to contend.</p>
<p>First, to know that someone is an advocate of &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is to know practically nothing.  To know that a person is a &#8220;jerk&#8221; is to know more.  Like the term &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is a rhetorical mechanism by which some groups of individuals have sought to neutralize those racially-oriented ideas that the politically dominant group deems threatening.  Like the terms &#8220;jerk&#8221; and &#8220;idiot,&#8221; it is an all-purpose device.  However, for all of the latter terms&rsquo; ambiguity, most of us haven&rsquo;t any difficulty spotting jerks and idiots when we encounter them.  Such cannot be said of &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; and &#8220;racists.&#8221; </p>
<p>Second, while the task of identifying &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is indeed formidable, the challenge of determining what &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is not is more readily surmountable.  One would think that a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; is a white person who either seeks to be as far away from non-whites as possible or to hold a position in which either he or other whites can perpetually weaken the social standing of non-whites  &mdash;  all non-whites.</p>
<p>Yet not only does Borzellieri fail to satisfy this description of &#8220;the white supremacist&#8221;; he blatantly defies it.   For one, Borzellieri has chosen to spend his professional life in the company of blacks and Hispanics  &mdash;  his students and their parents.  Moreover, he has labored incessantly, as a principal, an educator, and an elected member of the New York City school board, to guarantee that his black and Hispanic students get a first-rate education. </p>
<p>Borzellieri has more than a little experience interacting intimately with large non-white student populations: he taught English prior to being a principal and worked at other predominantly black and Hispanic schools before assuming responsibilities at Our Lady of Mount Carmel.  There is absolutely no evidence, or at least none that his accusers have as yet to supply, that Borzellieri ever so much as remotely mistreated any students.  Moreover, no less a figure than Father Eric Rapaglia, the man who initially hired him as principal at Mount Carmel two years ago and who now expresses regret over having done so, admits that &#8220;there was never any complaints from parents or students about him sent to the Archdiocese.&#8221;   </p>
<p>This hardly sounds like the workings of a raving, hate-filled &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there is another consideration that puts the lie to the charge that Borzellieri is a &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221; In the very same writings in which he notes  &mdash;  correctly  &mdash;  that, measured by such indicia as rates of crime and academic performance, blacks and Hispanics are at a disadvantage with respect to whites, he also observes  &mdash;  again, correctly  &mdash;  that relative to the same standards, whites are at a disadvantage relative to Asians.</p>
<p>To put it simply, by the same criteria that his critics judge him a &#8220;white supremacist,&#8221; we could just as easily  &mdash;  and much more consistently  &mdash;  judge him an &#8220;Asian supremacist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, Borzellieri has done or said nothing to suggest, much less establish, that he is any sort of &#8220;supremacist.&#8221;  In addition to his own writings, his detractors cite Borzellieri&rsquo;s relationship with &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221; as the basis for their claim to the contrary.  In so doing, however, they only convict themselves further of gross illogic.   </p>
<p>To argue that Borzellieri is a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; because he associates with American Renaissance and the latter champions &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is like arguing that theism is true because the Bible claims that it is.  The problem here is that the very reasons one has for doubting the truth of theism are precisely the same reasons that one has for doubting the claims of the Bible.  Similarly, we first have to show that &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; has any meaning within the context of American Renaissance before we can use Borzellieri&rsquo;s association with it to show that he is a &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221;  To argue otherwise is to beg the question.     </p>
<p>According to American Renaissance&rsquo;s website, since &#8220;race and racial conflict are at the heart of the most serious challenges the Western world faces in the 21st century,&#8221; it seeks to ameliorate misunderstandings by analyzing &#8220;all aspects of race, whether historical, cultural, or biological.&#8221;  That whites would organize for the purposes of calling into question the conventional egalitarian vision of race relations is alone more than sufficient to condemn them in the eyes of the self-appointed guardians of our Politically Correct orthodoxy.  That they would dare to note IQ differences between blacks and themselves, and that they would argue that such differences are predominantly hereditary, is enough to insure their reduction to non-persons.</p>
<p>One needn&rsquo;t agree with American Renaissance&rsquo;s findings in order to recognize, and respect, the fact that it seeks to address issues of real importance.  That is, one needn&rsquo;t agree with its positions in order to recognize that the fury with which its nemeses attack it is entirely undeserved, the function of a raw anti-intellectualism.  And that the charge of &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is as unwarranted when made against American Renaissance as it is when hurled against Borzellieri is obvious once we consider that while American Renaissance observes that whites as a group have a higher IQ than blacks as a group, it just as quickly notes that northern Asians have a higher IQ than whites.  It is a strange sort of &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; that affirms the intellectual superiority of non-whites over whites.</p>
<p>{snip}  </p>
<p>The logic  &mdash;  or illogic  &mdash;  of Borzellieri&rsquo;s situation aside, the real story here is the ungodly treatment to which he has been subjected by his fellow Christians. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frank Borzellieri is in need.  Yet not only has the Church within which he has spent his life and to which he has provided tireless service refused to attend to his needs; Borzellieri is in the situation that he is because of it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[&hellip;] Borzellieri violated the doctrines of Political Correctness, not Catholicism.  It is for this transgression that the Archdiocese threw him out in the cold.</p>

		<p>What a lot of people don&rsquo;t know is that Asians are actually at a disadvantage to whites. The reason for this is because the Asians actually learned everything from the whites. All of this information about the Asians being so much smarter than whites is actually bogus when you consider that it was the white race that actually started the Asian cultures and civilizations. No, it was actually the white&rsquo;s that taught the asians. The white people are the most intelligent people in the world today. Even the asians are going to have to cow down to them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Homogeneous supremacy&#8221; is a type of vanity or pride that all of mankind&rsquo;s groups ought to strive for, for at least their own groups mental well being and to fuel the desire for the groups survival.</p>
<p>I wish others no harm, I just want little to nothing from them and would prefer to see them also remain untainted by the influence of other out groups, who&rsquo;d also corrupt their innate ways of living.</p>
<p>But no, we must learn to live in the global melting pot and love everything non White(authorized topics only) and hate everything that has been identified as being &#8216;White&rsquo;(which seldom seem to be the positive contributions to our modern world).</p>
<p>Being a racist may be reprehensible, but being completely a-racist/ or racially blind (as a White person) is beyond foolish is a unsustainable type of extremism in itself. </p>

		<p>The only reasonable way to defend against charges of &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is to embrace it.  Arguments are irrelevant and lies and deception are the main techniques of our enemies.  Their goal is white genocide.  Power and the skillful application of it, to destroy those enemies is or should be the goal of whites everywhere.</p>
<p>While they focus on propaganda, we should focus on infiltration and takeover of institutions.  Where they seek the hearts and minds of people (mostly through degeneracy), we should seek obedience through severe sanction.  They want a war of words&hellip;..wars are fought with bullets.</p>
<p>They want to save the planet by restricting population.  Our children and our children&rsquo;s children should be legion and take over the earth in the name of our God.</p>

		<p>White supremacism is the new McCarthyism. Since cowing us into silence via accusations of racism is going to lose it&rsquo;s power when we are a hated and oppressed minority in our own lands, a new way had to be found to silence honest debate let alone whites standing up for their rights and interests. However, white supremacism to me and a growing number of other whites is also absurd, since we are most definitely not in control of the country, hostile non-whites who want us dead are.</p>

		<p>I am not sure Asians are smarter than whites.  The Bell Curve answered the question by limiting the question to East Asians not Asian in general, that score higher than whites.  And then, East Asian only score slightly higher than whites.  This surprised me that they only scored slightly higher.  When you consider East Asian cultures are largely homogenous and in tact.  White societies have been decimated by multicultalism.  I would have though East Asians would score considerably higher given the sorry state of self-loathing whites societies have become.</p>

		<p>#9 brings up a very important point.  Essentially, we are all looking at averages or means with the IQ issue and thus miss quite a bit.  East Asians may score higher than Whites on average, but the White IQ shows more variation, greater dispersion than East Asians.  The White IQ has more high and very high IQ scores but also more low scores.  </p>
<p>East Asians (particularly the Japanese and Koreans from personal experience) produce a very steady stream of fairly bright students who work hard and so on but lack a certain creative spark.  They don&rsquo;t produce as many low IQ individuals but neither do they produce many geniuses either. Also, Asians lean towards very conservative, risk-averse behavior that tends to prohibit the creative, curious, chance-taking that pushed Western man forward.  </p>
<p>Even when Asians do produce curious, adventuresome individuals, their conformist cultures see such people as problems.  Nails to be hammered down, as the Japanese saying goes.  In other words, regression to the mean is culturally mandated.  </p>

		<p>There are plenty of dumb white people.  I don&rsquo;t think any serious discussion of race needs to hang its hat on IQ because I don&rsquo;t think that IQ, in and of itself, is the truly deciding factor in failed race relations or failed levels of at least average achievement by blacks or badly behaving whites (and, again, there are plenty).  Obviously, a group of low intelligence people left to their own devices may not function that well, but I note that some commenters in Amren have cited sub-saharans peoples with low IQ as some sort of evidence of inferiority but if these IQs are truly low at least these peoples have frequently developed stable ways of living over time. Sure they don&rsquo;t have HD TVs and hybrid vehicles etc. but do you really need these things to live?  Access to medical care is a larger issue for them rather than access to consumer goods.  Anyway, the races don&rsquo;t seem to mix very well here (or there) but asserting that IQ is the basis for all the problems falls well short of helping to develop realistic solutions.</p>

		<p>First you have to clearly establish that both sides of the argument mean exactly the same thing by &#8220;supremacy&#8221;. One can make a strong case that Whites are indeed intellectually and behaviorally superior to African blacks. Blacks are generally more athletic, and Asians may be better students. One must guard against the probability that it is irrational hatred that is actually the topic being discussed.</p>

		<p>How many patents awarded to high-IQ Finns? It takes more than IQ to be an inventor. If you met a group of people with an IQ of 136+ they would not stand out in personality, character or occupation and I know bc MENSA reported in the mid-2000s that Serbia had the highest ratio of &#8216;geniuses&rsquo; (IQ 136+) behind Israel and Slovenia, so a documentary was made to profile these people. The Right has SO screwed itself with the IQ thing into elitism, away from the working class. AmRen encouraged it too.</p>

<p>All people are supremacists. This is a healthy natural instinct. It is only white people who are stupid enough to apologise for it. That is the real problem with Frank Borzellieri  and this article dripping with apologies. Blacks or Hispanics or Asians do not apologize for their own acts of self interest or supremacy. Only foolish whites do.<br>

&#8220;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&#8221; is a controversial 2002 book by Dr. Richard Lynn, Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Ulster, Northern Ireland, and Dr. Tatu Vanhanen, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.[1] The book argues that differences in national income (in the form of per capita gross domestic product) correlate with differences in the average national intelligence quotient (IQ)<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations</a><br>
 <br>
In a chart presented by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen IQ score averages from different test samples are presented for Finland, Germany, China, Chinese countries, South Korea, and Japan. <br>
 <br>
Averages from Finland are 98 and 96.<br>
 <br>
Averages for West Germany are 107, 99, 101, and 105.<br>
 <br>
Averages for East Germany are 90, 97, and 99.<br>
 <br>
Averages for China are 100, 92,5, 103,4, and 103.<br>
 <br>
Averages for Hong Kong are 103.4, 110, 109, 107, and 107.<br>
 <br>
Average for Chinese in Singapore is 107.5.<br>
 <br>
Averages for South Korea are 104.7 and 106.4.<br>
 <br>
Averages for Taiwan are 101, 103.5, 105, and 105.<br>
 <br>
Averages for Japan are 102, 106, 109, 104, 103, 99, 105, 110, 103.9, and 106.<br>
 <br>
Few European countries have average scores above 100. Few Oriental countries have average scores below that number.<br>

<p>We are hated now and we are the majority.  When people say, &#8220;It will be hell when we&rsquo;re a minority.&#8221;  I hope seeing blacks and browns in positions of power and seeing the havoc they bring and the anti-white plans they are trying to implement should wake up the majority of whites into fighting back and voting their own interests. Whites throughout history have always eventually defeated larger armies and that was back when the only weapons we had were swords and spears.  Now we have guns.  There will be a growing number of whites who will be pro-white, who will fight back hard against those who wish us harm, and a growing number of whites who are armed and won&rsquo;t lay down their arms.  Hell, there&rsquo;s a growing number of whites I see at shooting ranges (even white women) who are good shots and target practicing and storing up ammo and long-term food and water supplies.  Remember, a small number of whites controlled many parts of the world for centuries.  It&rsquo;s more the quality of the people that win and triumph; not always the quantity.</p>

		<p>I would like to make a few points about what you said. I am not the poster of the comments of poster number 2 but I would like to respond.</p>
<p>First of all, I, for one, don&rsquo;t care what strangers who are already prone to anti-white racism; racial aggrievement political lies,  exaggerations,  obsessions, or white guilt; and Marxist social sciences think about us. Such creatures have such tunnel vision that they are not worth the effort to convince. I for one have no respect whatsoever for such cultural Marxists. If some idiot thinks that I or number 2 poster is delusional, I do not care or respect their opinion. I do respect their right to have such a stupid opinion, though. </p>
<p>Second, as far as I can tell, English speakers from all over the world read articles and make comments here so when #2 (not me) wrote:</p>
<p> &ldquo;All of this information about the Asians being so much smarter than whites is actually bogus when you consider that it was the white race that actually started the Asian cultures and civilizations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>that could be interpreted to mean Asians in the British usage, Pakistanis and Indians from India, South Asians, or it could mean Asains in the usage common in the United States and demanded by the &#8220;Asians&#8221; themselves, meaning people that we used to call &#8220;Orientals,&#8221; meaning of the Mongoloid race, Chinese, Japanese, Mongols, Manchus, Hmong, Thai, etc. </p>
<p>In either case number 2 poster is correct. If you study the ancient Chinese annals, you will find that some of the very earliest and most ancient Chinese emperors were described in terms that indicate that they were Caucasian. I believe that some of their remains show this also.</p>
<p>In ancient times, the vast majority of steppe nomads inhabiting the grasslands all the way to the borders of China were Caucasians. Most of them spoke languages in the Iranian language family of the Indo-European superfamily. Many of them were of Nordic type. This has been known for well over 100 years and there is ample archaeological and osteological evidence of this. Recent television programs have hyped the &#8220;Mummies of the Takla Makan,&#8221; Tarim Basin Mummies who were of Nordic type and of very ancient provenance in many cases. Again this has been known for a very long time and is not new. Interestingly, the people in question spoke a &#8220;Centum&#8221; language which means that it is, surprisingly, from the western families of the Indo-European superfamily, like Celtic or Germanic languages, and not from the eastern branch like the Iranian languages. The Tocharians, as they are sometimes called because their language has been dubbed Tocharian (again, known for quite some time) had textiles that used a plaid pattern and so in appearance and clothing styles they appeared much like Celtic and Germanic people. They traded with nearby nomadic tribes (who for the first millennium or so of the time of the steppe nomads looked much like the Tocharians did)  in the Altai mountains (the Tocharians were almost surrounded by mountains with the Kunlun Mountains and Tibet to the south, the Pamir Mountains in the west,  the Altai mountains to the north, and the Gobi desert to the east. They developed an advanced Buddhist civilization based in several city-states situated along the rivers and primarily on the fringe of the desert near the mountains.</p>
<p>India had a similar situation. The indigenous people of India were previously of Mediterranean type and also of Australoid type in some areas. Australoids were called  Archaic Caucasoids by anthropologists for many years. Therefore the people of India are primarily of Cacasoid types. The true Aryans (not the misnomer used by the Nazis)  invaded India from Iran about 1,500 B.C. They were probably originally of Nordic type as there is ample evidence that all of the Indo-Europeans originally came from a Nordic type but mixed with other groups later.  They took to India with them and developed a religion that became Hinduism. Interestingly, some of the true Aryans (meaning they belonged to a tribal group or confederation called Aryans) moved westward to the upper Euphrates River.  These people were the nobles and royalty of the Kingdom of Mitanni. Like their steppe nomad ancestors, they were renowned and expert horse breeders. They worshipped the same gods as the Aryans of India and they spoke the same language, a sort of Sanskrit. They influenced the Hittites greatly as the Hittites adopted much of their religion. There are ancient records of their Aryan language (again, this is the correct usage of the term Aryan, not the incorrect usage of the Nazis and others). </p>
<p>Lest you think that there were Caucasians on the border of China only starting in ancient times, consider that there were Paleolithic Caucasian people whose range stretched from Western Europe all the way through Mongolia.  They were of the Cro-Magnon race which was a specific type of Caucasian and they looked just like the people of Dalarna, Sweden. The type is similar to the Nordic type to the uninitiated but they have several special phenotypic traits, heavy, very powerful bones and musculature, a relatively short, wide face combined with long-headedness (dolicocephaly)(this is a very unusual combination and Nordics have a long narrow face), a very specific cranial architecture, high, prominent cheekbones and bridge of the nose, a brain of about 1600 cc., long forearms, short lower legs, etc. Their coloring was like that of the Nordics. Some Nordics and others have mixed with some Cro-Magnons. This  Cro-Magnon Race was a specific (local race or subrace of the Caucasian family) although the cultural marxists have tried to deny that and have muddied the waters. Look it up in an older edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence that Caucasian people resided over some of the earliest civilizations in South and East Asia. There is nothing at all ignorant about that assertion. </p>
<p>By the way, which ethnic group has tested with the highest IQs in the world? To which major race to they belong? They belong primarily to the Caucasian Race although they tend to imply that they are different. Chinese and Japanese people rate second in IQs. Also, Scandinavians (mainly Nordic) rate pretty darn high on the IQ test scale, too. Also, people of mongoloid type often rate very high on some aspects of intelligence but not so high on others like language and language acquisition. That is probably why one meets immigrants to the U.S. from eastern Asia who never, even after 30, 40, or 50 years or more learn to speak English very well. I think we need to reconsider exactly who is delusional here.  We also need to consider who has been brainwashed by the cultural marxists who control the social sciences now. <br>

<p>Point well-taken. However, the English people are almost purely Danish and have been proven as such in recent genetic testing in which English and Danish people tested closer to identical than any other two current countries. This was cited in a recent article in Der Spiegel. Also, while some IQ tests  may have different results, the Celtic people have a proven track record of great innovation and ingenuity and especially great achievment in the language and literature realm, not to mention the Scottish Enlightenment of great achievment in the sciences. The ancient Celts invented the first mechanical harvester, chain mail armor, most of the equipment that the Romans adopted, the sleeping bag, and many other great innovations (see The Celtic Empire: The First Millennium of Celtic History, 1000BC - AD51 by Peter Berresford Ellis). Celtic people rate second to none in literture. Also, many, many people of the British Isles have a huge amount of Norse heritage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blacks are generally more athetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>False perception greatly promoted by our enemies. Blacks tend to excell at some running events. Because of their long limbed tropical rainforest adaptations they tend to have an advantage in long-range boxing because of reach. When they have to deal with very cold, harsh conditions in wars (as was shown in the Korean War by their high cold caused casualty rate such as frostbite) this so-called advantage turns into a lack of survival ability in cold conditions. </p>
<p>Look at the olympic records. Whites are much more athletic in many, many sports. Whites are the physically most powerful race. Look at both world power lifting and olympic weightlifting records.  There have been many recent cases of anti-white predjudice in which predjudiced recruiters pass up more qualified whites in football and other sports (see the website Caste Football for more information). I don&rsquo;t think that blacks will ever seriously challenge whites on a large scale in swimming, either. On overall general ability across many athletic endeavors and in many climates, whites surpass blacks. In general, whites are generalists who are oveall excellent in many ways. In addition, we are the physically strongest race. </p>

		<p> Richard Lynn&rsquo;s work is now worthless because it gives natioal averages not racial ones. Helsinki now has a large Somali pop. with an IQ of under 85, thats brought the Finns right down. The Italians who staved off mass immigration until the last decade now have Europe&rsquo;s highest score.The obvious truth from pre 1990 data which I quoted is that urban Nordic people are the smartest,but politically no longer the wisest.</p>

		<p>We are hated, for we speak against our destruction. We are hated because we do not sit back and allow our demise. Those who think they can speak to the general public using words of logic are delusional. Most whites are lost, and long gone. Many whites have been permanently erased from our people because they&rsquo;ve reproduced with nonwhites. Do the original peoples of Europe realize their dire situation? We truly are the survivors of an apocalyptic infection, even if walls still stand and dancing with the stars still airs.<br>
But, one must note, that with our demise, I am seeing the unraveling of modern society in itself. Our economy is crumbling, our schools falling apart, political unrest, infrastructure in ruins; we are on the verge of major food and energy shortages. The very entities that are working against the original peoples of Europe are in themselves, dying. You cannot expect any more golden eggs when you kill the   goose that lays them.  However, do not expect a quiet death, I imagine that in their last breathe they will try, with all their might to destroy us before they expire. </p>

		<p>Rocky Mountain claims that Armreners assume low sub Sahara IQ is a mark of inferiority whereas in fact those folks really don&rsquo;t need HD television and hybred vehicles to live.  I have to take issue with this charcterization of Amreners.  Instead we recognize that IQ is designed to measure the ability to succeed in a Westerm Culture.  And it does so very well.  There are perhaps other tests that measure the ability to survive and  prosper in a sub-Sahara environment such than an IQ of 70 is no hindrance.  Perhaps a genetic predisposition to instant gratification, a lack of planning for the future and not supporting ones off spring are the kinds of things that work well in such an environment because nothing of value needs to be created except another human being to carry on the race.  If that is what it takes to survive in Africa I wouldn&rsquo;t call them inferior but would say they are certainly not we want or need in the West.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll have to stop Canadians from teaching in the States. Because of our social programs we are told that Canada is a nicer and fairer country. That implies Canadians are a more genuine type of human being, not as self-centered as Americans. You can call it Canadian Supremacy and you&rsquo;ll have to stop it from spreading into your country. France thinks it is a better country than the US, especially more cultured. You&rsquo;ll have to stop Frenchmen from teaching too.</p>
<p>What does the Catholic school board think about teachers in the poorer schools who don&rsquo;t want to live in the neighborhood? These teachers also don&rsquo;t want to send their own kids to the school where they teach. This is class supremacy and is an insult to students and their parents.<br>

		<p>When in college, as a result of my persuasive arguments against my rabidly liberal professors, I was often labeled a white supremacist by them. My simple answer was rather than to foolishly deny it, I proudly agreed that I was. That would infuriate them even more. My simple answer to their accusation was that all of history was proof of the white man&rsquo;s superiority&hellip;checkmate.</p>

		<p>THE FINLAND PHENOMENON</p>
<p>There seems to be some confusion here.<br>
 <br>
Finnish mean IQ is not 108.</p>
<p>East Asian or North Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) mean IQs do generally exceed white Europeans.</p>
<p>What has got people talking about supposed extraordinary intelligence in Finland is the results of PISA scores.</p>
<p>PISA = Program for International Student Assessment</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an international assessment that measures the performance of 15-year-olds in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every 3 years.  First implemented in 2000, PISA is coordinated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organization of 34 member countries. In all, 60 countries and 5 other education systems participated as partners in PISA 2009.</p>
<p>Each PISA cycle assesses one of the three subject areas in depth. In PISA 2009, reading literacy was the subject area assessed in depth, and science literacy and mathematics literacy were the minor subjects assessed.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to a detailed report by the US govt. on the 2009 test focused on US performance.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/3upwr" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/3upwr</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the official scores table.</p>
<p><a href="/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf</a></p>
<p>Finland came out near the top with a score of 536, the highest European score.</p>
<p>These scores below are Overall. (At the link you can see subsets. Note the math and science scores)</p>
<p>Absolute highest was (mainland) China at 556</p>
<p>Korea 539<br>
Finland 536<br>
Hong Kong 533<br>
Singapore 526<br>
Canada 524<br>
New Zealand 521<br>
Japan 520<br>
Australia 515<br>
Netherlands 508<br>
Belgium 506<br>
Norway 503<br>
Estonia 501<br>
Switzerland 501<br>
Poland 500<br>
Iceland 500<br>
UNITED STATES 500<br>
Liechtenstein 499 <br>
Sweden 497 <br>
Germany 497 <br>
Ireland 496 <br>
France 496 <br>
Chinese Taipei 495 <br>
Denmark 495<br>
United Kingdom 494 <br>
Hungary 494 <br>
Portugal 489 <br>
Macao-China 487 <br>
Italy 486 <br>
Latvia 484 <br>
Slovenia 483 <br>
Greece 483 <br>
Spain 481 <br>
Czech Republic 478 <br>
Slovak Republic 477 <br>
Croatia 476 <br>
Israel 474 <br>
Luxembourg 472 <br>
Austria 470 <br>
Lithuania 468<br>
Turkey 464 <br>
Dubai (UAE ) 459 <br>
Russian Federation 459</p>
<p>and so on</p>
<p>As you can see this seems compatible with the notion of NE Asian high IQ, tending to be a bit higher than European white. (Again note the math and science results)</p>
<p>As we all know the USA is unfortunately no longer nearly all white. And in spite of that and our much maligned educational system the USA scored very well, higher that most European nations.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the race realists here would love to know how USA whites alone scored. </p>
<p>VERY WELL INDEED.</p>
<p>That US govt report on p.29 has scores by race/ethnicity.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/3upwr" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/3upwr</a></p>
<p>U.S. average 500<br>
White, non-Hispanic 525<br>
Black, non-Hispanic 441<br>
Hispanic 466<br>
Asian, non-Hispanic 541<br>
American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic ‡<br>
Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic ‡<br>
Two or more races, non-Hispanic 502<br>
OECD average 493</p>
<p>‡ Reporting standards not met.</p>
<p>NOTE: Black includes African American, and Hispanic includes Latino. Students who identified themselves as being of Hispanic origin were classified as Hispanic, regardless of their race.<br>
Thus, USA white non-Hispanic at 525 ranks just below Singapore and above Canada and among non-Asian scores is exceeded only by Finland.</p>
<p>US Asian at 541 is exceeded only by Mainland China.</p>
<p>The ranking order of USA Asians, Whites, Hispanics and Blacks should surprise no one. We see this in many data sets.</p>
<p>One more wrinkle to consider. It is not only the USA whose scores are brought down by its non-Asian minorities. Some European countries are in the same position due to recent heavy non-white immigration.</p>
<p>So an analysis has been done to adjust their scores too by excluding all first and second generation immigrants.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting graph of those adjusted results.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to click on it as I can&rsquo;t copy/paste any of it. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that it results in Switz., Canada, Netherlands and Germany rising above USA whites and Belgium ties USA whites.</p>
<p>Still very respectable results for the USA whites.</p>

		<p>A CLARIFICATION re THE FINLAND PHENOMENON</p>
<p>I posted that the top PISA score went to &#8216;China&rsquo; or &#8216;mainland China&rsquo;. Actually it was &#8216;Shanghai - China&rsquo; rather than the entire country.  Naturally one would expect the schools to be better in Shanghai than the country at large and the students to be more socio-economically advantaged.</p>
<p>How timely that on 12/18/11 Steve Sailer posted:</p>
<p><a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2011/12/pisa-what-about-rest-of-china.html" rel="nofollow">http://isteve.blogspot.com/2011/12/pisa-what-about-rest-of-china.html</a></p>
<p>PISA: What about the rest of China?</p>
<p>[wherein he cites another writer who had posted]:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shanghai got by far the best results out of all the OECD countries (never mind the developing ones). . Now while you might (rightly) argue Shanghai draws much of the elite of the Yangtze river delta, the Financial Times has more: &ldquo;Citing further, as-yet unpublished OECD research, Mr Schleicher said: &ldquo;We have actually done Pisa in 12 of the provinces in China. Even in some of the very poor areas you get performance close to the OECD average.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since countries like the US and France get scores &ldquo;close to the OECD average&rdquo;, this means that the workforces soon to be entering China&rsquo;s economy, even from its poorest regions, will be no less skilled than those of leading Western economies (note too that the numbers of Chinese university graduates are soaring). And with China&rsquo;s massive population, four times bigger than America&rsquo;s, its road to superpowerdom must be all but guaranteed.&#8221;</p>
<p>[to which Steve commented]: &#8220;Okay, there are a few leaps of faith there, but that&rsquo;s still news worth knowing. At minimum, it reduces the chances that the Shanghai numbers were a con job&hellip;&hellip;..It&rsquo;s a little hard to be certain what &#8220;Even in some of the very poor areas you get performance close to the OECD average&#8221; means, but it sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>The logic of using international test scores to predict future wealth is not that the causation runs only in one direction, from high test scores to wealth. Obviously, it runs in both directions. (For example, affluent Chinese have traditionally hired tutors to raise their children&rsquo;s test results.) But, if there are a whole bunch of poor farm kids in inland China who are scoring like kids in Europe and North America right now, well, that&rsquo;s worth knowing.&#8221;<br>

<p>Bravo! You said it all. Anywhere there are nonwhites, you will see what they have done to once beautiful White neighborhoods and cities. We build, they destroy. We give, they take. </p>
<p>Those so-called smart Asians do not have one decent, clean civilized nation. So how can one call them &#8220;smart&#8221;?  Only Whites have the &#8220;smarts&#8221; to create and invent and MAINTAIN their civilizations. So to all these posters who drone on endlessly about the smart Asians, I have come to put them on ignore, as they are as deluded as the White liberal in our country.</p>
