			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Thompson, Daily Mail (London), December 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The victim of a brutal sexual assault confronted her attacker in court and told him: &#8216;I am not the victim, I&rsquo;m the victor&rsquo;.<br>
	<br>
Heidi Damon waived her right to anonymity to be allowed to be filmed in court unleashing her anger as her attacker Javon Cooper was jailed for 15 years after attempting to kill and rape her.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old told Cooper, 18: &#8216;I just want to tell you  &mdash;  and I want you to look at me when I address you  &mdash;  I woke up ecstatic today, happier than ever.</p>
<p>&#8216;You know why? Because I&rsquo;m alive. I&rsquo;m alive, alive, alive.</p>
<p>&#8216;You have not broken my spirit. You have not changed my belief in God. If anything, you&rsquo;ve strengthened both. I am not a victim. I am the victor, the stronger and the winner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Ms Damon spoke, Cooper, dressed in a prison issue orange jumpsuit, shifted uncomfortably and tried to avert his gaze from his victim.</p>
<p>Cooper had pleaded guilty to attempted murder and attempted sexual battery.</p>
<p>He was 16 when he pounced on Ms Damon in a multi-storey car park in Ybor City, Florida, in August 2009.</p>
<p>Cooper choked Ms Damon until she blacked out, and stripped her off her trousers and underwear.</p>
<p>Such was the force of the strangling that her eyes turned red and she was covered in bruises.</p>
<p>Ms Damon was out of work for a year and still suffers from chronic headaches. She told the court she is still afraid.</p>
<p>At his sentencing Ms Damon stood a few feet from her attacker as she lashed out at him.</p>
<p>She told him: &#8216;My desire to be all that I can be cannot be broken by you or anyone. I survived.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She told Cooper that he will always be a boy, that a man could never do what he had done.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;I will never forgive you because what you have done to me is never forgivable.</p>
<p>&#8216;I contribute to my community. You help decay yours.</p>
<p>&#8216;My life will never be the same. You know why? It&rsquo;s going to be better than it was before.</p>
<p>&#8216;My tears are out of joy,&rsquo; she told him. &#8216;Because I&rsquo;ll never see you again. Ever.</p>
<p>&#8216;Oh and by the way, I do have one more thing,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;My name is Heidi Elizabeth Damon. I have a name. I have a name that will go on forever. </p>
<p>&#8216;You have a number and the title of the crimes that you&rsquo;ve committed. Your name is Sex Offender, Attempted Murderer. Nice to put you away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Damon said she agreed to waive her anonymity as she wanted to speak out for other &#8216;silent victims&rsquo; of rape.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;I feel proud because I was able to stand there and get what I wanted out and articulate it without falling apart.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m satisfied with the fact that he&rsquo;s going away. I&rsquo;m ecstatic that I lived to tell the story, and he was caught and that I potentially saved someone&rsquo;s life that day by being the one that was chosen to be attacked, and I lived through it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cooper was jailed for 15 years and ten years probation.</p>
<p>The judge told him he would have liked to lock him up for life.</p>

		<p>Good for Heidi Damon! She is right to go public like this and bash her assailant.  This low life should have gotten more than 15 years for such a horrible crime. He&rsquo;ll still be young when he gets out, probably more muscular from the weight lifting in prison and more capable of killing his next white rape victim. </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;d be the victor if this rapist was castrated. When we punish racist black rapists with castration, then maybe they will understand that rape is unacceptable. Then they will truly be losers.</p>
<p>As it is, he&rsquo;ll be out in 10-15 years and do more damage along the same lines.</p>

		<p>I admire her spirit but might her joy turn to fear? He will be young enough when he gets out to hunt her down if he so desires. She may realize this and change her name in the future. I have no doubt she will keep track of his parole status.</p>

Seek,</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll go to the original article, you will see a picture of Javon Cooper that will leave you in no doubt whatsoever regarding his race. I do agree, however, that most of us could have predicted this just knowing his name as it&rsquo;s pretty much a dead giveaway.</p>

<p>It is disturbing when these victims make a big show of &#8220;forgiving&#8221; the utterly busted culprits.  Seems like a misinterpretation of the teachings of Jesus.</p>

<p>Extracts from &#8220;The Guardian&#8221; (London) letter page, December 10:<br>
  &#8220;I left the country on holiday on the day the riots broke out,and returned two nights after they ended. I was a bit disappointed to find that Harrods was still standing.&#8221; - Paul Ingrams, Aberystwyth [miles away].<br>
  &#8220;The key message from the Guardian/LSE report on the summer riots is about the importance of treating people [i.e. perpetrators not victims] with respect&hellip; A classic example is the appalling language that government ministers have used to describe the rioters&hellip; If anyone spoke of any of my family members in that kind of language I would be angry.&#8221; - Duncan Forbes, Cymbran [also miles away].<br>
  &#8220;I am surprised we do not have more riots in this country&hellip; If we cannot provide our young people with a future it is we who are committing a crime.&#8221; - Daphne Cotton, Twickenham.<br>
  &#8220;Our local garage is the one where three young men were killed in the riots.  In the last few days we have heard that a local youth centre has had its grant cut&hellip;unbelievably irrational.&#8221; - Bishop Peter Hall, Birmingham. [Nuffin to do tonight, so let&rsquo;s go out and kill people.]</p>

		<p>Look folks&hellip;</p>
<p>If you are a member of the congenitally evil (those whose people score 90, 95ish to 110 on the EQ scale (Evil Quotient), you are going to have to start going with your congenital evilness soon or you will be wiped out.</p>
<p>Time and time again, people who score high on the EQ scale have proven by their success vis-a-vis the lower EQ types, that their evilness is the cause of all the good people&rsquo;s suffering.  The correlation between high EQ and all sorts of positive life outcomes is really pretty incontrovertible and therefore increasingly as congenitally good people reproduce more and require more support from congenitally evil people&hellip;</p>
<p>Unless the congenitally evil start acting as evil as their genes demand&hellip;they will indeed be subsumed by a horde of congenitally good people.</p>
<p>The evil must fight or die, and therefore must start getting a little more evil.  Play to our strength, you know?  Because the congenitally good are going to have one hell of a problem when they pull down enough of the congenitally evil whites.  Then, maybe then they&rsquo;ll realize how congenitally evil the East Asians are!</p>
<p>Whitey - you gotta get at least a little evil, or yer going to die.  </p>
<p>Maybe more than a little evil&hellip;</p>

		<p>Castration for such perps instantly accomplishes three valuable goals:</p>
<p>1) prevents them from passing on their worthless genes</p>
<p>2) ends the glamour and cachet of jail for impressionable younger punks</p>
<p>3) removes their source of libido and aggression, making them much safer both in and out of jail</p>

		<p>Two more young White kids are dead today after having been hit by a drugged out Mau Mau who was trying to get away from the police. The two boys were walking their girlfriends home in a suburb of Afrodelphia when this 18 year old &#8220;youf&#8221; ran them down. The two kids were High School freshman. The &#8220;youf&#8221; kept on going and asked his girlfriend to report the car as having been stolen. </p>

		<p>Castration is absolutely a good idea;I am all for it. However the readers talk as if this creature will put his rape tendencies on hold for 10 years. Not true. He will have ample time and opportunity to practice his passion in prison.

		<p>The likes of rapists like this guy should die at the end of a rope, the way rapists once were hung across Europe and America as well. As for the lady confronting him, it&rsquo;s all in vain because he will be raping and probably murdering another woman before his 15-year sentence is up, because they will release this beast onto the streets long before them.</p>

		<p>It is an ongoing outrage (one of many) that we have to get stories like this from foreign news because fascist media is complicit in obfuscating the truth and covering up the crimes of non-whites against society.  You feeling alienated yet white america?  Absolutely disgusting. Whites that tolerate liberal media and support it with their $$ are either complete idiots or spineless cowards. Personally, I&rsquo;ve been going out of my way to not send money their direction for years now. No Sports Illustrated swim suit issue&hellip;nothing. nada, zip, zero and crap like this is one reason why.</p>

		<p>If I were a relative or friend of this woman, I&rsquo;d be waiting for him with a Mauser equipped with a Leupold scope  when he got out of prison and the only thing I&rsquo;d feel would be a slight recoil.</p>

		<p>@Girlish, </p>
<p>Because she is showing her &#8220;empowerment&#8221; by refusing to be a victim.  She&rsquo;s better off for her statements but the chance that her words affected him are small.  She is a victim and will carry those scars forever.  His attack wasn&rsquo;t personal, and it wasn&rsquo;t about her.  Most any white woman that was maybe average would have worked.  It was personal to her but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand his perspective.  </p>
<p>To put it in context, if you have ever broken up with someone that was distraught at your decision, was there anything they could say that would make you change your mind?  The decision you made was about you, not them.  Not a perfect analogy, but good enough.  </p>
