			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Durante, Daily Mail (London), December 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eve Carson, the University of North Carolina student president brutally murdered by two thugs in 2008, pleaded for her life and even asked them to pray with her, startling court testimony has revealed.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old was kidnapped as she left the university library on March 5, 2008 and forced to take out money from an ATM before she was shot five times.</p>
<p>Jayson McNeil, of Durham, an acquaintance of the two men accused of killing Miss Carson, said in court yesterday that he was told what happened.</p>
<p>He said he was called by Laurence Lovette Jr., shortly after the arrest of his alleged cohort, Demario Atwater, who has already pleaded guilty to the killing.</p>
<p>Lovette, 20, of Durham, has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, robbing and murdering Miss Carson.</p>
<p>McNeil testified that Miss Carson was walking to her car in the early morning when the attackers &#8216;rushed&rsquo; her.</p>
<p>They pushed her in the back seat of her car and took a terrifying trip to an ATM to withdraw $700, the daily limit.</p>
<p>McNeil said in court that from the beginning of the ordeal, she begged her attackers not to kill her.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Before she even got shot, she was saying let&rsquo;s pray together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But despite her pleas, Miss Carson was shot four times with a .25 calibre pistol.</p>
<p>Then came a blast from a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun to her right temple, leaving a large gaping wound to her head and the hand she used to try and shield herself.</p>
<p>Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall said the final shot was &#8216;instantly fatal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her body was left where she fell, in the middle of a residential street near the university.</p>
<p>After the murder, the pair allegedly continued to return to ATMs, withdrawing the $700 from her account each time.</p>
<p>Miss Carson, 22, from Athens, Georgia, was the university&rsquo;s popular student body president and a recipient of the highly regarded Morehead scholarship.</p>
<p>The North Carolina News &amp; Observer reported that McNeil was a crack dealer at the time, who was known in the area for having easy access to cars.</p>
<p>He is testifying against Lovette in exchange for a lighter sentence in a federal drug case.</p>
<p>Atwater pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced to two life prison terms.</p>
<p>Lovette will not face the death penalty if convicted because he was a minor at the time of the shooting. He could face life in prison.</p>
<p>Jurors winced last week as they were shown crime-scene photos of Miss Carson&rsquo;s body, which was discovered by a Chapel Hill police officer who responded to a 911 call reporting the sound of gunshots and a woman&rsquo;s scream shortly after 5am.</p>
<p>Shell casings lay on the asphalt near the body. </p>
<p>Miss Carson wore a gold locket around her neck. On her left wrist, she was wearing a paper bracelet she got earlier in the week at a Tar Heel basketball game, emblazoned with the phrase &#8216;Be True.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lovette&rsquo;s DNA was found on the inside door of Miss Carson&rsquo;s Toyota, according to the prosecutor.</p>
<p>Woodall said Atwater&rsquo;s girlfriend will testify to the jury she was with Lovette as he disposed of pieces from the small-calibre handgun the defendant allegedly used to shoot Miss Carson in the cheek, arm, shoulder and buttocks.</p>
<p>Parts of that gun, including the barrel, were later recovered and matched to two bullets taken from Miss Carson&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>A man was also captured on surveillance footage using her card at an ATM. </p>
<p>Mr Woodall said the clothes and distinctive hairstyle of the man in the video will identify him as Lovette.</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Karen Bethea-Shields in her opening statement conceded that Lovette knew Atwater and that the prosecution will have evidence connecting her client to Miss Carson&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>But she denied Lovette was with Atwater when he shot Miss Carson with the shotgun. Many of the witnesses for the prosecution will have criminal records and motives to lie, she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;There&rsquo;s no forensic evidence to connect Lawrence Lovette to the killing of Eve Carson,&rsquo; Miss Bethea-Shields said.</p>
<p>She predicted to the jury that the prosecution&rsquo;s case will leave them with more questions than answers, which she said will add up to reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>&#8216;You will have questions about whether they really have any case at all against the defendant,&rsquo; she said.</p>

		<p>I understand the commenting guidelines about &#8220;criticizing traditional religions of the west,&#8221; but the &#8220;turning of the other cheek&#8221; quote from the Bible is in direct conflict with Nature&rsquo;s prime directives: Procreate, Fight, or Flee. According to the New Testament, even Christ himself flew into a rage when he saw money changers in his church.</p>
<p>There was a piece on here recently about the nationalist band &#8220;Sol Invictus&#8221; (Invincible Sun). Their most trenchant criticism was in a song called &#8220;Kneel to the Cross.&#8221; The whole thing is available on Youtube, but here are a few lyrics worth contemplating:</p>
<p> &#8220;Give them gold and they&rsquo;ll save your soul<br>
 And kneel to the cross on the wall<br>
 Hail to the boss of the great unwashed<br>
 And kneel to the cross on the wall<br>
 They wail and weep, the march of the sheep<br>
 As they go to the cross on the wall<br>
 And it&rsquo;s ever so wrong to dare to be strong<br>
 So kneel to the cross on the wall&#8221;</p>

		<p>I noticed that the victim was kidnapped leaving the university library. Most universities forbid people from carrying firearms on campus despite what the local gun control laws say. So these two thugs assumed that this poor girl was not armed when they kidnapped her. Maybe her family can sue the university. Well should anyone try to kidnap me because they assume I might be unarmed for some reason. Well surprise. We all do not obey moronic university regulations.</p>

		<p>Whenever it comes to dealing with a tyrant, always remember:  A show of strength, not weakness, is what impresses, especially when the tyrant is black.  Projecting helplessness to the predator does not dissuade and in fact emboldens him.  Blacks do not respect &#8220;nice&#8221; white people.  Indeed, our niceness merely makes them believe we&rsquo;re trying to weasel out of our just desserts.</p>
<p>Whites:  Go see the new movie, &#8220;Immortals,&#8221; to stiffen your spine.</p>

		<p>On the news this am 12/14 there was a story about a murder and attempted murder at an historically black college in Florida.  Pictures showed almost everyone in the marching band is black.</p>
<p>The marching band has a hazing ritual.  They beat new members in the typical black 5 against 1 ritual.  3 of them beat one new member to death and seriously injured another.  Most of the student body and band members are from black high schools in Georgia.  The Georgia high school marching bands also practice<br>
serious 5 against 1 beatings as part of the initiation ritual.</p>
<p>We always think of the male athletes as being violent.  But these are musicians, both men and women.  The murder victim was a man.  The one who survived is a woman who was beaten by 4 men.</p>
<p>How big, bad and brave.  Such machismo.</p>
<p>The military, government work, public schools, private and public colleges, public transportation, driving and parking your car, shopping, just staying at home where ever blacks are it is dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the criminals.  It&rsquo;s all those so called respectable blacks like the military and college students like these.</p>

		<p>I have a registered gun and I used to carry it although carrying was against gun laws.  My idea was that I would shoot to kill, pick up the casing and disappear.</p>
<p>BUT  unless you carry the gun in your hand, with a bullet in the chamber, safety off and ready to fire at the midsection, you are at a disadvantage when stalked by a mugging team.</p>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t carry anymore because I live in a totally black free area.  I always looked behind me about 3 times every block especially when walking.  When driving I looked behind, in front, on the sidestreets and in the parked cars.  When ever I saw a black man, especially 2 or 3 the classic mugging team I went on high alert.</p>
<p>Parked cars are standard predator tactics.  You don&rsquo;t notice when driving.  The predators will pull out after you and follow.<br>
With cell phones they might have another carful in the area.</p>
<p><br>
They are experienced skilled hunters.  One behind that you don&rsquo;t see.  One in front to accost you.  Usually a driver with the getaway car.  Sometimes another.  Even in the middle of the night there is enoug traffic noise in most cities to drown out the sound of footsteps behind you.</p>
<p>It is not easy for a woman to dig a gun out of her purse.  It is not that easy to dig a gun out of the waistband either.  When the gun is under a coat or jacket in a holster you have to practice drawing it.</p>
<p>Guns are good at fighting off black predators.  But know what you are doing, practice quick and easy access, be on the lookout at all times, have the gun ready to fire and do not hesitate to blast away at the midsection.</p>
<p>A woman like Eve Carson with a gun in her purse or backpack would not have much of a chance against skilled predators.  From the news stories they swarmed her before she knew what was happening.</p>
<p>If you carry, have your gun easily accessible and be ready to shoot.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read about this case over the last few years. Very sad&hellip; Very disturbing and sad. RIP young lady. Beautiful young lady. You and thousands more like you are gone because of an egalitarian&rsquo;s idealistic notion that &#8220;little blacks and little Whites can play together.&#8221; I wasn&rsquo;t around when the 1964 Civil Rights march &amp; 1965 nonwhite immigration act were introduced to American society. I want to firmly believe that the &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; really thought they were making the right choices. That the White equality pushers were truly believing that all would be well with the racial aspect.</p>
<p>But what White race realists like AmRen readers figured out a long time ago is that self-esteem and actual skills and capabilities go hand in hand. Many blacks feel that they are superior to others like in athletic ability and &#8220;game&#8221; ie, getting women. The problem for them is that the average White kid doesn&rsquo;t care about that. Sure teenage males of all races have raging hormones and want to hook up with girls. But most White and Asian males also have aspirations of college, career, traveling, etc. Ironically some may want to help 3rd world populations socially, economically and environmentally. </p>
<p>How many black kids have these goals on their minds in school? I wish I had the exact figures. I know a lot of it has to do with their environment, but who creates that environment of idolizing killers, pimps, pushers, race hustlers, and thug athletes? It sounds like a rhetorical question, but what it is is a reciprocating question. Blacks create black environments. Who knew! </p>
<p>These types of cases are mainly the reason why hair brain stream media types do not want the American public to find out about. They do not want people who use common sense that God gave us to protest and think that blacks can be very vindictive and racist about so-called &#8220;inhumanities&#8221; of the past. Even if you take the past atrocities against blacks at face value, any logical person above a double digit IQ can understand that all those evil White racists of the past are no longer alive. And the laws have been rewritten to appease the minorities, endless amounts of social programs funded, special college scholarships funded, equal opportunities given to those &#8220;oppressed&#8221; to live in White neighborhoods, work in traditionally White enclaves, and the list goes on. So why would interracial crime be so one-sided in the year 2011? Excuses made by liberals and race hustlers, and living on lies that Whites still oppress others, which hasn&rsquo;t happened in any type of large numbers in over fifty years. </p>

		<p>The Federal minimum wage in 2010-2911 is $7.25. After only several months of full time or even part time employment, these young men would have more money in their pockets. They have traded a few months work for a lifetime in prison.  If they have no consideration for life and are guided only by greed,  they still are failures. But one hopes that in the minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years and decades ahead of them their conscious will cause them to suffer and they will cause no more harm in this world. The greatest they can hope to do - nothing worse than they&rsquo;ve done. While a minimum wage worker might raise a family, start a business, support a charity, or just relax at home they pay for with their own money. How these young men have brought dishonor among their families and friends. </p>

		<p>I am always amazed how universities seem to think that they can &#8220;turn off the Constitution&#8221;. They seem to think that they are above the law. How do these State sponsored institutions negate the 2nd amendment? This poor girl may have survived had she been able to carry a weapon. She would at least had a fighting chance.</p>
<p>When are people going to wake up and understand that the First Principal is: The right to defend one&rsquo;s life. Self defense is the fundamental human right.</p>

		<p>I am absolutely convinced that the southerners knew what they were dealing with and knew what was necessary for survival. Their supposed predjudice and racism was simply realism and necessary measures for survival. It is a simple and important as that. Having worked with sidewinders in government institutions, I know what they are and how they must be dealt with if we are even going to survive.</p>

<p>Care to offer any advice on how to do this and get away with it? In the major metropolitan area where I live, if I were to walk down the street carrying a gun IN MY HAND, I believe someone would undoubtedly call the cops on me.  If a cop happened to see me doing it, I don&rsquo;t know what his/her response would be, but I tend to think he/she wouldn&rsquo;t just continue on their merry way.  And I live in a very gun friendly state.</p>

		<p>I live in Baltimore, and a few years ago, at a local mall in a nice area, two blacks with a shotgun waited in a car, and when they spotted a white man, one walked up, took his wallet, shot him in the head; he turned out to be the headmaster of Gilman School, a very exclusive private school. This behavior just continues whites just don&rsquo;t care. Two blacks here just stabbed to death a Hopkins medical student for a few dollars.  He was 23 years old, named Pitcairn.</p>

<p>Many of our strongest soldiers are committed Christians.  The weak kind of Christianity that we are seeing now is just a reflection of the general move to liberalism. Turning the other cheek has been blown up all out of proportion to the way that it was used in the Bible.  It is the extreme liberal mindset that distorts everything.  Turning the other cheek does not mean, for example, that we should not jail criminals.  That would be an injustice, not turning the other cheek.</p>

		<p>#7 - If you are expecting these people to have any remorse you are wishing in the wind. Just look at the smarmy grin on Atwater&rsquo;s face, does that look like someone with a conscience? </p>
<p>And the idea that this would bring dishonor on their friends and families, also wishing in the wind. Do you honestly think the families and communities that spawned these people have the moral compass to even feel dishonored? You have to have honor in the first place to be dishonored. </p>

Turning the other cheek. I have heard that ad nauseam thrown at me from a few atheists. </p>
<p>When everybody knows that Jesus always spoke in parables  If someone strikes you, you are doing something that provokes them, so to turn the other cheek, you stick to your guns, you keep doing what it was that annoyed them in the first place, even if you get hit again. Do what is right. </p>

		<p>I live in Chapel Hill and Eve Carson&rsquo;s murder took place just a couple miles from my house. As a former race apologist this brutal murder, along with the Duke lacrosse case in nearby Durham, was instrumental in opening my eyes to race realism. I cant believe how naive I used to be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the original poster who you posed your question to, but I often carry a Ruger LCP .380 in a pocket holster. The gun is in my front right pocket and I stroll the neighborhood with my hand in my pocket on the grip of the gun, ready to pull it out if need be.</p>

		<p>Another voice here for a sense of healthy spirituality - the kind that makes a person stronger in the face of adversity. Not everyone who has heard the message interprets it the same.</p>
<p>Given the way Shannon Christian died I would fear that defiance on this woman&rsquo;s part could have bought her a much slower and more painful death than she had to suffer as it was.</p>
<p>Few of us know until we are walking in the shoes and then I&rsquo;m sure we expect our instincts, right or wrong, to guide us.</p>
<p>This is written with respect for the idea that we need to be mutually supportive of each other and acknowledging that we won&rsquo;t all agree on what each others&rsquo; strengths/weaknesses are.  Can we afford to alienate each other?  I personally don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Can we all bring our talents and to the table?  I hope so.</p>

		<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know the area, there are only 3 towns in Orange County, NC. There&rsquo;s Chapel Hill, Carroboro, and Hillsborough. Hillsborough is the county seat where these trials are taking place. Chapel Hill is, well, Chapel Hill, lots of liberals, college professors, and rich people living off oof trust funds. Carrboro, is sort of middle class, but quite liberal. Hillsborough is still conservative, although the liberal whackos are taking over. </p>
<p>Anyway, my husband was in Hillsborough one night some years ago and he was stopped at a light when some Black guy came up to his truck and tried to open the door to his truck. My husband has a concealed carry permit and he pulled his gun out and pointed it at the thug&rsquo;s face and that was the end of that. The guy took off running. Ny husband said he thought the guy was just drunk, and he didn&rsquo;t want to shoot him. but if he had continued to make agressive moves, he would have shot him. </p>
<p>Eve Carson was a victim of her own delusions about equality, but ultimately, the mindset of the University of Chapel Hill did her in. </p>

&#8220;I understand the commenting guidelines about &ldquo;criticizing traditional religions of the west,&rdquo; but the &ldquo;turning of the other cheek&rdquo; quote from the Bible is in direct conflict with Nature&rsquo;s prime directives: Procreate, Fight, or Flee. According to the New Testament, even Christ himself flew into a rage when he saw money changers in his church.&#8221;</p>
<p>That specific verse is talking about avoiding conflict, not self defense. And one should indeed avoid conflict if at all possible. There is nothing unchristian about self defense tho. Jesus also told the disciples to buy swords, (Luke 22:36). There is a difference between avoiding as much violence as possible, and defending yourself, or the life of another innocent person, from serious harm or murder. </p>

And I would not be surprised if her parents are willing to forgive the black thugs who killed their daughter, even make excuses for their antisocial behavior. This poor white girl was a victim of a liberal society that is antiwhite. She was brainwashed into thinking you can trust black, she completely underestimated their potential for violence. She wanted them to pray with her and they preyed on her. When will whites ever learn to avoid blacks as much as possible. One last point, how many hear read that the white basketball player who got his face bloodied by those black players from Un. of Cinn. has offered the &#8220;olive branch&#8221; to his attackers.

<p>On campus, students passed out daisies and carnations, and large boards were erected for students to leave written memories. An evening candlelight vigil was planned, and dozens of counselors from both North Carolina and nearby Duke University were available to talk to students. </p>
<p>Carson was a prestigious Morehead-Cain scholar and a North Carolina Fellow, taking part in a four-year leadership development program for undergraduates. A premed student, she majored in political science and biology, taught science at a Chapel Hill elementary school, studied abroad in Cuba, and <b>spent summers volunteering in Ecuador, Egypt and Ghana as part of a school program.</b> </p>
<p>She was involved in campus programs for hunger relief, among many other activities, and was featured on the Morehead-Cain Web site that described her experiences working in Ecuador. &#8220;One of the most important lessons I learned &hellip; is that poverty is not a pitiable thing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In Chillanes, I saw a respect for poverty and a respect for a non-material way of life.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="/" rel="nofollow">/news/2009/04/jones_excited_a.php</a></p>
<p>Student Body President Jasmin Jones is approaching diversity with enthusiasm and vigor, and campus cultural leaders are hopeful that she will promote inclusivity and tolerance within the community.</p>
<p>For Jones, the issue of diversity goes far beyond race and is about devising ways of increasing communication and understanding between cultural groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People think diversity is about skin color, but it goes so much further than that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about breaking barriers that are often not broken; it&rsquo;s a lack of communication that still exists,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;There are still limitations that we hold within ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Crimes like this get virtually no play in the MSM.  Unless you search the alternative websites you haven&rsquo;t even heard of this.  Meanwhile the white perp cases get thousands of hours of coverage.  The cowardly Oreilly, Hannity, and Von Sustern won&rsquo;t even give people a heads up that this is happening.  I watched CNN a few days, 2 weeks ago, and they only carried white perp crime.  This poor young lady was used to warm and cuddly blacks on commercials, who are wise and wouldn&rsquo;t hurt anyone.  She wan&rsquo;t properly vigilant is she saw them lurking. She should have run the other way rather than advancing into a range of vulnerability.  She should have screamed at the slightest sign of advance.  But she probably didn&rsquo;t because that would have been racist.  The propagandists have taken another life.  I&rsquo;m sorry that your society has failed you, sweet young lady.</p>

		<p>I would be interested in knowing how much this was planned or the result of practice against other victims.</p>
<p>People without conscience may still have fear.  If you fear the consequences of armed robbery, you may kill to lessen the odds of a life sentence or death penalty.</p>
<p>That said, the other side of discretion is a mass killing where the attack becomes seen as an act of particular heinous intent.  Numbers deter violence if not robbery by making the prospect of an escapee or mob-rush too hard to avoid.</p>
<p>White women, because of their sexual appearance and gender-driven behavior modes (accomodate, deflect, subordinate, survive) should not be left alone to wander outdoors in dangerous social environments.</p>
<p>If they will not accept the help of males then they need to buddy up among their own and arm up with weapon that work.  If a gun is beyond them, a tazer or mace is not.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go out after dark, alone.  Don&rsquo;t go to certain areas, repeatedly, where you can be marked out as a behaviorally habitual (laundromat, library, etc.) in being alone or distracted.  Never park away from a main building and refuse to accept an escort out because _even that little window_ can be exploited.</p>
<p>We are not sheep.  We must think to guard ourselves.</p>

<p>Let your arm go down the side of your leg. On the side away from the street.  Point the gun down. The gun will be partially hidden by your leg and hand.  That way it is not easy to see, especially at night when the black predators are most dangerous.</p>
<p>If you loop an empty super market plastic bag around your wrist, the bag helps conceal the gun and being empty won&rsquo;t interfere if you have to fire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea for a White woman to keep and empty plastic bag in each of her purses.  When it gets dark or you have to go to to a mall or somewhere where there are predators, just put the purse in the plastic bag and no one will know you have a purse.</p>
<p>The point is, blacks are notorious for swarming their victims from behind before you can get your gun out.  Be ready to use it.</p>
<p>Most of all, keep an eye out for blacks.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that Eve Carson would have carried, even if it was deemed legal on campus or even encouraged.  My wife believes in carrying and self-defense, etc., but even so, she hasn&rsquo;t got the temperament required to carry and USE.  Most women don&rsquo;t.  It is a distortion of feminism and the media to think or assume that women would or could.  This is why the old chivalric model was and is valuable.  As one who does carry, the law allows me to intervene in harm being done ANYONE.  So the real story is that if more are carrying, there is a higher chance that someone will be around to defend someone who can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I really grieve over this case and others like it.  But part of the problem also is that her outlook made her feel that nothing bad could happen to her.  She should never have been out alone at the time she was alone.  (my wife often works a swing shift, and she never goes to her car alone).  I&rsquo;ve known many young white people who seem to be of the belief that because they are on the &#8220;right side&#8221; of issues, nothing can happen to them.  They are of course, ready made victims.</p>

But if you wear loose pants or shorts, you could still have your defense ready.  </p>
<p>I was told a long time ago to leave enough space ahead of your and the car in front for you to pull around. Also, in a worse case scenario, nothing is stopping you from flooring your car and pushing your way out, and pushing can work in forward and reverse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of our strongest soldiers are committed Christians. The weak kind of Christianity that we are seeing now is just a reflection of the general move to liberalism. Turning the other cheek has been blown up all out of proportion to the way that it was used in the Bible. It is the extreme liberal mindset that distorts everything. Turning the other cheek does not mean, for example, that we should not jail criminals. That would be an injustice, not turning the other cheek.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am afraid that I must disagree with you on all points. Jesus, as the example to Christians turned his cheek to all sorts of derision, punishments, and cruel execution.  The problem isn&rsquo;t jailing of criminals, that is the &#8220;Law of Ceasar&#8221; in action, it is the victims and their families that as Christians can&rsquo;t live with themselves until they forgive their perpetrators.  I&rsquo;ve heard the most strict preachers of Protestantism call for the congregation to take up its cross daily all my life.  </p>
<p>The tendency toward self-destruction in Christianity is as old as the faith itself.  Historically, especially in the beginning, Christians were enthusiastic regarding the chance to be a martyr for their faith.  Gibbon has a couple chapters in his classic history; &#8220;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&#8221;  Crusaders, notably Knight&rsquo;s Templars may have been the first in history to repeatedly use suicidal tactics for attaining both victory and martyrdom, only sometimes they were defeated anyway (The Horns of Hattin).  Also, the Crusaders were largely Normans who were more Viking then perhaps than actual Christians.  They had merely transferred their sub-culture into the political and nominal domain of the Church.  Christianity has always struggled to rationalize its use of war and even murder in furthering its earthly aims.  What the Christian soldiers you speak of today are results of are centuries of habitual blindness that allows for a functioning schizophrenia that allows a Christian to think they are pious while functioning as warriors for a state.  Lastly, the fact is that there is nothing in the NT that justifies Christians being martial in any sense.  Many will quote the verse that recalls Jesus calling on his disciples to bring their swords, but then warns them; &#8220;He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword.&#8221; (Matt 26:52)  The facts are that as the Bible is set since 324, there is no case for violence in Christianity, even though its history is thoroughly injected with it.  It worked well for the West during the era exploration and empire, the excuse being for adherence to the command of Jesus to preach the gospel to the world and seek to convert all.  But since the end of the era of empire the very same justifications are being used against the Western World as excuses for mass invasions and the accommodating of the world into the West.  Those who are the frank enemies of the West simply use Christian rules and the ethics of our civilization to defeat us.  </p>
<p>For myself, I currently think that the ability of so-called Christians to be combat soldiers and reconcile it is due to a cultural history of radicals like Oliver Cromwell, who mixed his Puritan religious outlook with politics to a degree that he beheaded a king and killed hundreds of thousands (in Ireland) and saw no sin in it, making himself dictator of England and calling it democracy.  The ability to convert the Christian God into a war god has a president in Judaism where Yaweh goes from war god to lawmaking god to war god repeatedly.  But the god of Jesus has no place for earthly war and its potential gains.  This is what there is to be found by any objective reader. The Beatitudes are exceptional and the literary as well as instructional height of the alleged ministry of Jesus.  It requires nothing less than frank hypocrisy to act otherwise than proscribed therein.  This has always been a problem for Christianity in practice.  There has to be a disconnect, the change from war god to law maker god has to be done without cognition, by what can only be described as a near schizoid process.  Nothing has ever come of this but dysfunction, and my belief is that this is exactly the Achilles Heel of the West.  The details of European history are an archive of - if nothing else, the details of this struggle, and the complete failure of their realization.  Indeed, only final absolution could save any Christian from the life they necessarily must live if they are to survive at all, let alone thrive.</p>
<p>Overall, I have to agree with the nationalist Sol Invictus group.  Whites must go through a painful change from a deeply implanted religion through a set of cognizant mental exercises, even exorcisms, to finally settle onto a congruent Western spirituality.  Such an event seems near impossible to me, given the ferocity that Conservative Christians defend the idea that there is a place for white exclusiveness, or even white ethnic identity in their belief system. Then of course, when one truly examines the demands made on a Christian, we can see the impossibility of any hope for earthly success, because all is aimed at a kind of abandonment of life on earth for &#8220;a better place.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Realists would fight like demons for their place in the sun right here on earth because they know that this is likely all there is for them or anyone.  For white spirituality, we have other Western traditions that are not contradictory to our exclusiveness or right to survive and thrive, right here on our earth.</p>

<p>Rights are one thing.  Nature is another.  I couldn&rsquo;t tell you how many naive young white women I&rsquo;ve seen at local trails trying to get their bike in or out of the back of the Explorer or head-and-shoulders in the trunk of the Subaru looking for their running shoes at dusk without even flinching when someone walks past, running in the park by themselves after sundown, you name it.  I get that you&rsquo;re in shape.  That&rsquo;s great.  But your strength doesn&rsquo;t come close to that of a man.  And if there&rsquo;s more than one man, forget it.</p>
<p>I feel like warning them &#8220;you know if I were a pervert I could have just rapped you on the back of the head, thrown you in the trunk and driven off to deal with you at my leisure&#8221; but then I&rsquo;d probably end up being the one who gets pepper sprayed for my trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve read about this case over the last few years. Very sad&hellip; Very disturbing and sad. RIP young lady. Beautiful young lady. You and thousands more like you are gone because of an egalitarian&rsquo;s idealistic notion that &ldquo;little blacks and little Whites can play together.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t around when the 1964 Civil Rights march &amp; 1965 nonwhite immigration act were introduced to American society. I want to firmly believe that the &ldquo;do-gooders&rdquo; really thought they were making the right choices. That the White equality pushers were truly believing that all would be well with the racial aspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please disabuse yourself of these notions.  The Civil Rights Movement was backed by cynical anti-American groups like The Frankfurt School, whose prime member Herbert Marcuse wrote of the principle of &#8220;Critical Theory&#8221; and authored the influential book, &#8220;Eros and Civilization.&#8221;  These ideas were at work and used by the NAACP and other groups in the 1950s.  The idea was to agitate, and criticize your object until enough questions and attention was gained for your simple ideas, such as; Whites have an undeserved advantage in America, and are racists.&#8221;  The communist party in America was active and MLK was associated with them. He pretended to be a man of peace, but his private actions did not reflect that.  All of the programs beyond LBJs Great Society proposals (made on the notion that America was wealthy and would always be wealthy), such as Affirmative Action, EOE, integration of schools, and other programs that gave priority of blacks (and by association, other minorities)priority in hiring, especially for government jobs, were won at the point of a gun, so to speak.  This was the beginning of the swindle that has finally show up in such overwhelming national dysfunction that it is unlikely to be fixed this side of a severe national and international economic and social collapse. </p>
<p>Their aim was not and is not racial harmony, but power through the overthrow of capitalism, and by implication, the white privilege that allegedly keeps capitalism going.  The promise is that no one race or group will have power over another, but no one playing the game believes that; they are all acting for themselves and the benefit/advancement of themselves by whatever means are creating through the practice Critical Theory.</p>

<p><br>
Turning the other cheek. I have heard that ad nauseam thrown at me from a few atheists.</p>
<p>When everybody knows that Jesus always spoke in parables If someone strikes you, you are doing something that provokes them, so to turn the other cheek, you stick to your guns, you keep doing what it was that annoyed them in the first place, even if you get hit again. Do what is right. &#8220;</p>
<p>Do you think this explanation makes any sense at all?  The only interpretation possible of what you are saying is that Jesus was instructing his disciples on how to conduct themselves when they were attacked for &#8220;his sake.&#8221;  But during the Sermon on the Mount, he was speaking universally, at least according to theologians and scholars, because he was speaking publicly, not merely his disciples.  </p>
<p>There are many other places where Jesus said to expect persecution as his followers.  That this has been trained in as Western psychological conditioning is the point; we keep insisting on doing the forgiving, taking abuse, certain that our enemies will come around because we &#8220;stick to our guns&#8221; in the view of our own righteousness.  Even Carson seemed to be hoping that she could appeal to their similar Christian training because she believed that &#8220;all are the same in Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no escaping the innate victimhood involved in Christian belief.  Had Eve Carson not been a &#8220;good Christian&#8221; she may have had the wariness to prevent this incident in the first place.  She was far too innocent and believing for this world.  And that&rsquo;s a basic problem for many whites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. - Exodus 21:23-25</p>
<p>[Jesus said] Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or tittle shall nowise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. - Matthew 5:18-19</p>
<p>(Jesus was pretty clear about what Christians today call the Old Testament. Cut out the &lsquo;eye for eye&rsquo; section of Exodus and you have no excuse not to cut out the stone tablets of Moses bit, also appearing in Exodus, as well.)&#8221;</p>
<p>What Bible did you get that quote from?  &hellip;.&#8221;no jot or tittle shall nowise pass from the law&#8221;&hellip;?!  </p>
<p>The chapter and verse section you are quoting from contains a complete sentence that you left out.  Matt 5:17-20 is a section regarding the LAW.  I think you know what Jesus threatened regarding the removal or adding in to his word?  Here is the entire section;</p>
<p>5:17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets: I have come to fulfill them.  5:18 I tell you in truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of the pen, will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.  5:19 Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 5:20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>Now what follows is the purported fulfillment of the old LAWS as Jesus&rsquo; sermon continues:</p>
<p>Matt 5:38 You have heard it said: &#8220;Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.&#8221;  5:39 But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the left cheek, turn to him the other also. 5:40 And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.  5:41 If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him another mile.  5:42 Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.</p>
<p>The Sermon on the Mount is Jesus giving fulfillment to the old Mosaic Laws, that is the preamble that you left out in your quote about the law (commands).  There are other sections as is well known regarding such things as Loving your enemies as opposed to the old law that gave permission to hate them, giving to the needy, and public praying, which Jesus seemed to hold particularly in contempt calling such hypocrites and called on them to pray in private, hide their good deeds from men, etc.  Using the old law from Exodus is therefore cancelled out for Christians.  This puts Christians in a terrible disadvantage in a world full of opportunists and people who will things to innocent people like Eve Carson and so many other of our white brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like having to tear at Christianity, because I was brought up as a Christian myself.  But I have long recognized the impossibility of the entire proposition.  If we are race realists, we must be realists truly.  And since we seem destined to die by the sword, we ought to learn again to live by it, with no apology.</p>

		<p>To 58 Anonymous, who wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Using the old law from Exodus is therefore cancelled out for Christians.&#8221; </p>
<p>I beg to differ with your interpretation of Christ&rsquo;s teaching on the law. When Jesus said He came to &#8220;fulfill the law,&#8221; the Greek word for fulfill means &#8220;to fill to the full&#8221; or &#8220;to carry into effect.&#8221;  When Christ said, &#8220;You have heard it said,&#8221; he wasn&rsquo;t speaking of the Old Testament law but the Pharisees&rsquo; misinterpretation of the law. The Jews had their oral tradition (now seen in the Talmud) where they added their own ideas to the Torah (OT). So the point of Jesus fulfilling the law is correcting Jewish misconceptions about the law and revealing its original intent. </p>
<p>For example, in Matthew 5:21-22 Jesus says, &#8220;You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, &#8216;Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.&rsquo; But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment.&#8221; By revealing the prohibition against holding grudges of anger, Jesus gets to the root of the issue   &mdash;   that men must follow the law from their hearts and not hypocritically. He wasn&rsquo;t abolishing the law but reiterating it accurately as seen from this passage in Leviticus 19:18   &mdash;   &#8220;&#8216;Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now about your &#8220;eye for an eye&#8221; quote, the principle here is that the punishment should fit the crime, and the context is in a legal setting before a court of law. You criticized another poster for using a Bible passage incompletely, but you did something similar. Here are Old Testament quotes Jesus is referencing and clarifying:</p>
<p>Exodus 21:22-24 &#8220;If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman&rsquo;s husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 19:16-21 &#8220;If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime, the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time. The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite, then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you. The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you. Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.&#8221; </p>
<p>By telling people to turn the other cheek, Jesus is not abolishing the law but prohibiting personal revenge. Meanwhile, a court of law is the legitimate venue by which to seek restitution for a crime committed against you by someone else. </p>
<p>Self defense against a criminal who wants to take your life, on the other hand, is another issue. Jesus wouldn&rsquo;t tell his disciples to buy swords as ornaments. They were for self defense.  <br>

<p>They had her money!! Why did they have to kill her? It only goes to show not only their total lack of humanity but their abysmal stupidity.  Had they let her go after the robbery and had been apprehended, all they would have faced were kidnapping and armed robbery. What they really wanted was to destroy something beautiful because they&rsquo;re so ugly both physically and spiritually. She wanted them to pray with her.  Poor, sweet, defenseless, naive little girl.  She went to Africa and returned alive but ended up dying at the hands of the beasts whom she wanted to help just as did Amy Biehl, begging for her life. <br>
I had to go to Trenton this past weekend to attend a funeral. How depressing to see those historic homes all boarded up and the once nice neighborhoods destroyed. <br>

		<p>S.L. Cain (#62), I&rsquo;m so glad I followed your link to the Wikipedia entry on &#8216;The Help&rsquo;.  Despite the fact that the Premier was held here in Madison County, I&rsquo;ve ignored &#8216;The Help&rsquo;&hellip;even though I&rsquo;ve known most of the vicious third-generation-nouveaux-riches who, by default, are Jackson&rsquo;s &#8220;Old Families&#8221; (their ancestors were the Carpetbaggers who murdered and dispossessed the real Founding Families).  In fact, I instantly figured out who the &#8216;social leader&rsquo;, &#8216;Hilly Holbrook&rsquo; is.</p>
<p>But what made me giddy with glee is that despite the Author&rsquo;s blatant pandering to blacks (along with the usual demonization of whites), she has apparently been sued by a former family maid, and publicly criticized by a black women&rsquo;s organization.  As frequently gets said in this comments section, you can&rsquo;t please blacks.</p>
<p>The Author&rsquo;s bit of comeuppance is such good news to one weary of hearing about a Southern literary industry which produces nothing but &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; movies, and &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; books.  Well&hellip;there is the corner of the industry which focuses on dizzy/ditzy/colorful/quirky/anachronistic/dysfunctional/degenerate white Southern &#8216;characters&rsquo;.  I guess &#8216;The Help&rsquo; is somewhere in-between.  Half the girls from my old private school seem to be writing &#8216;Southern Genre&rsquo; (when they&rsquo;re not falling-down-drunk, delivering political commentary on CNN).  </p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s nice to see that on occasion someone does pay a price for selling out her own race.<br>

		<p>I have pondered how to deal with a scenario such as this. I think that aware whites should be mentally prepared to try and avoid being murdered. </p>
<p>First, the victim should fight with all their might to not go anywhere with the perps. Better to be shot immediately out in the open than in a place or at a time where these criminals can take their time and place the shot. This poor girl probably could have survived a .25 caliber to the body, but not a well placed shotgun blast. </p>
<p>Second, if you can&rsquo;t get away, it is worth trying to reason with them, but not by asking them to pray. You must appeal to their self-interest, and take advantage of their stupidity. Claim to suffer from prosopagnosia, a disease which causes great difficulty in recognizing faces. Act slightly aspergery to make it seem believable. Show them the wikipedia entry for it on your smartphone. Explain to them that police spare no expense to find murderers but care very little for petty robberies. If they think you can&rsquo;t identify them, and you convince them that they are more likely to get away with it by not executing you, you have a better chance of survival. Outsmart the criminals! Don&rsquo;t waste time trying to appeal to religion or the humanity they don&rsquo;t have!</p>

		<p>A few additional suggestions to go along with poster 69:</p>
<p>Remember, blacks love bling.  If you&rsquo;re in one of those situations, compliment their bling and act like it&rsquo;s the neatest thing you&rsquo;ve ever seen in the world, in contrast with your own &#8220;tacky&#8221; self.  A number of years ago, I avoided what might have been a bad situation when a black driving a ghettomobile SUV almost hit me as I was crossing a street, with the light in my favor.  He parked his hooptee, got out of the car and tried to pick a fight with me.  Thinking on my feet, I noticed his fancy chrome spinning wheels, and made out like they were the best thing since sliced bread.  I went to far with the ruse and asked him where he got them (implying that I wanted to buy a set), how much they set him back, etc.  All of a sudden, he got a lot more congenial.  Giving permission to thuggy blacks to brag about how much they spent on their fancy wheels does make them a lot more jovial.</p>
<p>Other ideas:  Act like every stupid thing they say is the really clever, or the smartest thing you&rsquo;ve ever heard.  Make every minor conflagration your fault, but don&rsquo;t be too smarmy about it.</p>
