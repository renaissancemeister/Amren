<h1>Judge Grants New Trials in the Channon Christian, Chris Newsom Murders</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WBIR, December 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The four defendants  &mdash;  Lemaricus Davidson, Letalvis Cobbins, George Thomas and Vanessa Coleman  &mdash;  have all been sent back to prison, where they will stay through the new trials.</p>
<p>Special Judge Jon Kerry Blackwood presented a detailed account of illegal and unethical behavior by former judge Richard Baumgartner to feed a painkiller addiction prior to, during, and after the murder trials.</p>
<p>Because of the double jeopardy rule, none can be found guilty of any higher crime than their previous convictions. That means only Davidson is again eligible for the death penalty.</p>
<p>The victims&rsquo; families are now bracing for the new trials, which could take years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve wasted four years of our life because of what he did,&#8221; said Mary Newsom, mother of Chris Newsom, about Baumgartner&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, both Hugh Newsom and Gary Christian pointed out that they are upset at the conditions in which the prisoners live. Both say they have visited one of the state&rsquo;s maximum security prisons and feel that that the prisoners there are treated much better than they should be.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Letalvis Cobbins though complained to the judge about his treatment, saying, each time he leaves prison, he is mistreated, calling it &#8220;dehumanizing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Blackwood cut off Cobbins&rsquo; complaints and ordered him out of the courtroom.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Channon Christian and Chris Newsom were kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered in January 2007. {snip}</p>

		<p>It will never get any better until we have a homeland of our own.</p>
<p>The Color Of Crime (52% of murders, 35,000 rapes, 7X the violent crime, 8X the property crime, 4X the likelihood of using a weapon in a crime) and the fact that even the national news _admits_ that 31% of the blacks born between 2001 and 2010 will do time at some point in their lives, is GENETIC EVIDENCE that these behaviors are not simply pathologic but endemic.</p>
<p>Since we will not admit that evolving in the hole that is Africas climate, wildlife and pathogen soaked environment has had negative evolutionary impacts on black&rsquo;s ability to perform in a _Western_ based society, driven by concepts of integrity, honor, charity and _restraint_ in all things we are left without options.</p>
<p>There will be no genomic therapy to neutralize the 20% higher serum testosterone which gives blacks such aggression and mental problems.  We cannot even get them to breastfeed and up the oxytocin levels to give themselves a paltry 5 point IQ jump.</p>
<p>And we cannot continue to expect our children to respect our wills if we cannot even protect them.</p>
<p>Where segregation is &#8216;racist&rsquo; and subject to Imperia&hellip;ermmm, &#8216;Federal&rsquo; overview, separation is the only remaining option.</p>
<p>And it will not come peacefully.</p>

<p>Listening to Gary Christian in the first video reads like something being said at Amren, you can just see the anger and frustration in his eyes and on his face. To me, he&rsquo;s the vision I have of the type of strong White men that built this country. Gary Christian GETS IT! May God bless these two White families trying to get justice in BRA! </p>

		<p>It is as Joseph Wambaugh said years ago now. It is not so much the original crime [bad as it was] but what goes on afterwards that is the real crime. This is going to drag on and on for most if not all of our life times in a very inconclusive manner.</p>

		<p>Here are some stats to ponder:</p>
<p>The Dept of Justice informs us that 52 percent of homicides are committed by blacks. That is, nearly half of all homicides are committed by the 2.5 percent America&rsquo;s population that are black males, aged 18 to 49.</p>
<p>Consider &hellip;</p>
<p>There were 14,748 homicides in the USA in 2010.</p>
<p>About half of those, 7,374 we committed by black males, aged 18 to 49.</p>
<p>About half of their victims, 3,687, were White.</p>
<p>Blacks murder about 10 White people every day in the USA. </p>
<p>Perspective: 3,810 Whites have been murdered by blacks in South Africa in the past 17 years. </p>
<p>Perspective: There were 3,446 blacks lynched in the USA between  1882-1968 (86 years!). Most victims were guilty of violent crimes such as rape and murder.</p>
<p>(Note: The number of homicides in 2010 was the lowest in decades. <br>

		<p>How infuriating and disappointing this is. This crazy judge got exactly what he deserved. He knew better. Because of him, these families have to re-live the horror of their children&rsquo;s terrible murders. Not to mention the cost to the taxpayers.</p>
<p>Speaking from personal experience, I don&rsquo;t get the addiction to painkillers. I&rsquo;m just getting over an illness that required narcotic painkillers, and while they certainly did their job with the pain, they also left me in a sleepy haze all day, made me feel like I was moving in slow motion all the time, and I slept at all hours of the day. Who wants to live like that? I&rsquo;m healed enough that a couple of Tylenol will do the trick if needed, and good riddance to narcotics.</p>

		<p>5 - &#8220;3,810 Whites have been murdered by blacks in South Africa in the past 17 years&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where do you got informations about that but about 3500-4000 white farmers are killed in South Africa mostly by blacks. Since the end of apartheid about 30 000 white people have been killed. So you are refering only on farm attacks but excluding urban murders that are far numerous&hellip;so put this on perspective in 80 years about 3500 black have been lynched by whites in US but in 15 years 30 000 whites have been murderd by blacks in SA. But whites don&rsquo;t say a thing about that. If someone has exact statistics please write.</p>

		<p>The judiciary system has been corrupted. It&rsquo;s been Infiltrated by people, that have no interest in the safety of the public, or to see that justice be done. Criminals are constantly being let off, not because they have been proven innocent, but because there has been some breach of technicality, written in some subsection of another subsection, in some law book, that no one has have never heard of. </p>
<p>This is the most heinous and disgusting crime case I have ever heard of, yet it took them four years to get these monsters convicted. What on earth is going on? In a sane world, these vile people would have been trialed, sentenced and executed within weeks. </p>
<p>Yet now, after all those years, they will get a re-trial, without the possibility of tougher sentences. What difference does it make, if the judge was on drugs?  Was it not a jury that found them guilty? This is by no means an isolated incident. It seems to be the norm, rather than the exception now a day. </p>
<p>Remember Nidal Malik Hasan, the militant Muslim army psychiatrist, who shot 42 unarmed US military personal at Foot Hood in 2009, killing 13 of them? His trial hasn&rsquo;t even begun yet - two years after it happened. And recently the US Supreme Court ordered thousands of convicted criminals to be let loose on the streets of California, because they thought the prison facilities were too inhumane for them. <br>
  <br>
Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom were two kids in love, with their whole lives ahead of them. They were killed in the most brutal and sadistic way by black racist thugs, who couldn&rsquo;t care less. Had the roles been reversed, a national frenzy would have erupted, but the victims were only white people, so the media didn&rsquo;t care.   </p>
<p>My thoughts go to the families and friends of these young people. They thought they had finally gotten some closure to this nightmare, but now they will have to re- live it all over again.</p>
<p>If this madness is allowed to continue, do not be surprised to see vigilantes starting to emerge. Charles Brosnon may be dead, but Paul Kersey is alive and well, and even white people have limits to their tolerance.  <br>

		<p>I am furious&hellip;not at the judge, but at the system. The judge is a fool, of course, but he is not responsible for the system that will grant four evil, bloodthirsty black thugs a chance to win the &#8220;technicality lottery&#8221; and walk. The facts have not changed. The evidence has not changed. The jury was not corrupt. There is no reason for the murderers to receive a new trial. It is the evil overlords in Washington, the ones who created this odious system, who should be the objects of our wrath.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this.  Even if the judge was whacked on painkillers, doesn&rsquo;t the defense still have to show he made mistakes in the trial that jeopardized the defendants? </p>
<p>All criminal trials have errors but on appeal for a new trail these errors are usually ruled insufficient for reversal of a jury. Normally new trials are granted when evidence has been found that could exonerate the defendant before another jury. </p>
<p>Also at times new trials are granted where there is evidence of  out and out criminal conduct by police and-or the persecutors: <i> Criminal conduct that is aimed directly at convicting the defendant.</i>  This was not the case with the original judge, Richard Baumgartner. <br>
 <br>
I think there is another agenda.  This incompetent in black robes, <b>Judge Blackwood,</b> personally wanted a new trial for these people.  I learned that Blackwood is now retired, and guess what, look for him to run for office.  His unfounded decision to grant a new trial will serve him well among white liberals (fools) and the white-hating minority community.</p>
<p>Most disturbing to me was the passivity of the victims mothers in the face of Blackwood&rsquo;s ruling. Those of us on this board I feel rather certain would have shown a great deal of indignant outrage.  </p>
<p>When one beast was given the death penalty I didn&rsquo;t celebrate because I knew that this sentence in Tennessee would never be carried out.  In Texas, Georgia, Florida and any deep south state he would have been executed with eight to ten years. Much too long but at least the job gets done. </p>
<p>I would like to hear some of you bar certified lawyers out there comment on this situation. </p>

		<p>Reply to #7. Thank you for the clarifying this issue. I think that this shows just how serious these issues are and how vicious and murderous non-whites really are to whites. Whites should not ever, ever give power to non-whites and should fight with every ounce of strength that they have to prevent this. You will be fighting to protect your children! </p>
<p>May Mel Gibson be recognised for the treason he committed against his own people when he participated in the propaganda and anti-white hate psyop in which he starred, the egregious attack on the Afrikaners and all South African whites known as Lethal Weapon II (and every other movie in the series). Did you ever notice how very Nordic the evil bad-guys were, especially in the first two movies? That at a time when Nordic types were already banned from starring roles (with the exception of pretty-boy Brad Pitt).</p>

<p>We did have one. We set up the system for our people, but along the way the white man got stupid and gave up his power.  What guarantee do you have that even if we have our own homeland that in a couple centuries or even a generation that the whites then won&rsquo;t be full of guilt and anti-white propaganda that they will give it up like we did after WWII?</p>

		<p>The reason there are murder rate is lower in America isn&rsquo;t that attempts are down, but that we have good medical care for victims of trauma.  Without that, things would be much worse.  It&rsquo;s the reason Clinton could claim that violence was declining here in the 1990&rsquo;s when it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>We (European Americans/Europeans) need to move beyond the thought and belief that there is justice in this system we have been given; this should have been obvious when only one of these individuals received the death penalty for such a heinous crime (and this terrible offense did not even qualify as a hate crime).  We are dealing with a country and system that will not even defend its border against the illegal minority immigrate.  What do we expect?  If European Americans think that this country will suddenly begin to defend and seek justice for the European American/European victims of racial crime, we are sadly mistaken and fooling ourselves.</p>
<p>Should we receive the opportunity to have our own county again, there should be strict, racial safeguards established and put in place.  For decades, the European American/European individual has been sold out by his or her own leaders (e.g., Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965).  Look and see the European American/European racial caliber of individuals leading us in Washington: This is the real reason individuals such as Lemaricus Davidson, Letalvis Cobbins, George Thomas and Vanessa Coleman are able to get away with torture and murder.</p>
<p>To think our European Founding Fathers of America planned and intended and envisioned the United States of America we now occupy is ludicrous.   <br>

<p>I just read the original article. </p>
<p>Chris Newsom&rsquo;s mother is quoted as saying that as much as she regrets it, if the judge was impaired during the trial which resulted in the defendants (aka the murderers of her child) being convicted, then the defendants did not get a fair trial, and deserve a new one.</p>
<p>I think is it clear as daylight at noon on a sunny day that the right people were convicted. They do not deserve a new trial because the judge was taking prescription drugs during their trial.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no justification for granting a new trial just because the judge had a dependency on painkillers.  </p>
<p>Only if the judge acted improperly during the trial should a new trial be granted.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening here is you have apologists for blacks who commit crimes against white people.  No matter how heinous the crime these people will try to get the black perpetrator off.  </p>
<p>These people think blacks should be able to commit any kind of violent crime against whites with impunity.  They think blacks who are prosecuted for black on white violence are being wronged.  The Jena 6 sham is an example of this mentality.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forgot how after the Christian/Newsom murders a group of whites protested against the crime and the lack of media coverage.  The leftists protested against the protesters but not against the criminals.  These lunatics actually believe that prosecuting a black for committing an act of violence against a white person is &#8220;racism.&#8221;  They&rsquo;re completely insane and completely evil. </p>
