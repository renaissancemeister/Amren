			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leon Watson, Daily Mail (London), December 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Barbaric textbooks handed out in Saudi Arabian schools teach children how to cut off a thief&rsquo;s hands and feet under Sharia law, it has emerged.</p>
<p>The shocking books, paid for and printed by the Saudi government, also tell teenagers that Jews need to be exterminated and homosexuals should be &#8216;put to death&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Recent editions were obtained by the Institute for Gulf Affairs in Washington, D.C., which says they should raise fears in the West over the use of jihadist language.</p>
<p>The books were published and handed out to 9th and 10th-graders despite Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s promises to clean up textbooks in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, told Fox News: &#8216;This is where terrorism starts, in the education system.</p>
<p>&#8216;They show students how to cut (the) hand and the feet of a thief,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The textbooks were printed for the 2010-2011 academic year and translated from Arabic by the institute.</p>
<p>In one, for ninth-graders, students are taught the annihilation of the Jewish people is imperative.</p>
<p>One text reads in part: &#8216;The hour (of judgment) will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. There is a Jew behind me come and kill him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to the translations, women are described as weak and irresponsible.</p>
<p>Mr Al-Ahmed said the textbooks also call for homosexuals to be put to death &#8216;because they pose a danger at society, as the Saudi school books teaches&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Al-Ahmed said: &#8216;If you teach six million children in these important years of their lives, if you install that in their brain, no wonder we have so many Saudi suicide bombers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Saudi Embassy in Washington D.C. was approached for comment, but there was no immediate response.</p>

		<p>Many on the left blame everything that is wrong with the Islamic world, and with U.S. relations with Islamic countries on the Arab Israeli conflict - and implicitly on Israel&rsquo;s existence. <br>
 <br>
This is as unfair, and as flagrantly untrue as Nazis blaming Jews for Germany&rsquo;s defeat in World War I, the inflation that troubled Germany during the 1920s, and the unemployment that came to Germany from the international Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
Everything secular liberals hate about the religious right and the Bible Belt is far more true of even moderate Islamic countries like Jordan. This is not because of Israel. It is not because of Western imperialism. </p>

		<p>You pay for this every time you swipe your credit card at the gasoline pump.  Every mosque, Muslim pressure group, Muslim school, etc. in the West is paid for with oil money.  Every one of the thousands of madrassas in Pakistan and around the world turning pious conservative rural folk into raging terrorist maniacs is paid for with oil money.  And domestic oil drilling cannot save us - according to the CIA we have less than 2% of world oil reserves while OPEC has more than 78%.  Nor is this some green cabal there pushing an agenda; they also talk about how we have loads of natural gas and the world&rsquo;s #1 coal deposits.</p>
<p>So, how can we use our natural gas and coal to move our cars?  One way is electric cars like the Chevy Volt and Tesla Model S.  But the easiest way is just to require that those cars be able to run on methanol with an M.  Methanol (unlike ethanol) is not subsidized but is cheaper than gasoline anyway, even after taking mileage into account, and is higher octane and clean burning too.  What&rsquo;s the catch?  Our cars can&rsquo;t use it.  That&rsquo;s what we need to change, and after 20 years of watching automakers play &#8220;you go first&#8221; as our economy is drained and then crashed by the Muslims and as we have suffered from Muslim terror, it&rsquo;s time to stop waiting and asking and MAKE this happen.  We need to make FULL flex fuel capability a required standard feature on all new cars, like seat belts, as called for in H.R. 1687 and S. 1603, the Open Fuel Standards Act.</p>
<p>Controlling our destiny and bankrupting our enemies is more important than perfectly dainty hands-off policy on the economy.  </p>
<p>In the mean time in terms of what you can do on a day to day basis, visit E85Refueling.com and see if there&rsquo;s a filling station near you selling E85 (which is 85% ethanol and only 15% gasoline).  For a car that can use E85, visit E85Fuel dot com and click on Flexible Fuel Vehicles (or see http://goo.gl/VhOVn) for a list of all makes and models that can at least run on ethanol.  CarMax, AutoTrader, Cars dot com, and others all let you do searches for flex fuel vehicles (usually in the Advanced Search section or option).   Yes ethanol is subsidized, WHO CARES.  I&rsquo;d rather send my money to a white, all American corn farmer in the Midwest than a non-white, anti-American terror-tyrant in the Mideast.   Wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>

		<p>Nobody can call ME covertly or overtly pro-Muslim but if Muslims want to implement Abrahamic and Mosaic law on their native land then it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business. We stopped doing that to our detriment. What&rsquo;s wrong with cutting off the hand of a repeat offender thief or castrating a rapist? WE should return to the laws of our ancestors, not condemn those who still follow them.</p>

<p>Great idea, because food isn&rsquo;t expensive enough.  The three big drivers of food inflation over the last few years has been the printing presses, food stamp cards and ethanol.</p>

___________</p>
<p>I care, because the reason why corn-based ethanol has to be subsidized by MY tax dollars is because its production consumes more energy than it produces&hellip;.and a lot of its production involves using oil in some form. Burning your food supply is stupid.</p>

		<p>Where I live, the transit authority is looking to switch all of its buses to run on natural gas. We should have done the same with our cars. The best time to do this was in 1973. The second best time is right now. Let&rsquo;s stop giving aid and comfort to the enemy when we fuel up. (PS: The ethanol thing is a total boondoggle - METHANOL will actually work well and cost less.)</p>

The murder rate per 100,000 people in Saudi Arabia is 1.04. In the United States it is 4.8.<br>

<p>Have you ever watched &#8220;Locked Up Abroad&#8221; on the National Geographic Channel? Imagine the uproar it would cause in our country, if an American was caught shoplifting in Saudi Arabia.  And then sentenced to have his or her hand chopped off!</p>

<p>Foreign workers are often raped in the Middle East. They rape women, young men and boys. Muslims are similar to the Catholic Church. They fanatically hate homosexuals, but they feel it&rsquo;s ok to rape boys and young men.  It&rsquo;s very common and law enforcement doesn&rsquo;t care. When local Muslim women are raped, victims are often stoned for adultery. A raped woman is considered an adulteress in some Muslim countries. However, if you steal some figs from a rich oil sheik, they cut your hand off. </p>

		<p>#2 Irish So, how can we use our natural gas and coal to move our cars?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s alot easier than you make it out to be and would require no changes by most people in the white world.</p>
<p>Foreign oil is actually one big scam.  At about $100 a barrel, it is priced far above the actual worth of oil and what it easily obtainable from US sources.  The actual worth of oil is about $28 a barrel.  That is what it would cost to bring near limitless supplies of US oil to market.</p>
<p>1.  Heavy Distillites&hellip;.in other words, oil that needs a little help being mined, usually by pumping steam under ground.  At current consumption, the US has at least 1000 years worth.  At the rate new oil is found, it&rsquo;s more like 2000 years.  Cost to market, $28 a barrel.  No less than the Rand Corporation did the definitive research on this.</p>
<p>2.  Coal.  The US has thousands of years worth of oil in the form of coal.  Previous excuses were the process of converting coal to oil released too much CO2.  In other words, the lies of global warming have been used to us dependent on dangerous foreign oil.  However, even that excuse no longer exists as the new methods release no green house gasses.  Price to market&hellip;.way under $28.</p>
<p>3.  Biofuel.  No, I don&rsquo;t mean those idiots driving diesel engines on used fast food grease.  We have new synthetic micro-organisms that convert almost any carbon source into any type of fuel, especially oil.  Cost is about $28 a barrel, but takes up space.  </p>
<p>Our reliance on foreign oil is one big boondoggle forced on us by the democrats when they are in office but never seriously challenged by republicans when they are in office.</p>
<p>Note that a Ron Paul Presidency where true free markets are allowed to be expressed would likely quickly and permanently replace oil supplies with cheap, safe, sane, US sources.  This one issue all by itself would cause a massive, probably permanent economic boom in the US and permanently make it unthinkable for any country to challenge us militarily in any way (WWII made it clear that energy is the main military resource which win or lose wars).  Since Ron Paul is the ONLY candidate likely to give us something as simple as the freedom to choose what is best for our country, that makes him the only legitimately electable candidate.</p>

That argument is as unfounded as the optimistic predictions for the civil rights legislation that were made before the legislation was passed. There is no reason to suppose from past history that lower taxes and fewer regulations would increase economic growth. </p>

		<p>Oh, Gawd, I was hoping this was a Paul-free zone. (Being sarcastic; have to admire the Paulista&rsquo;s organization). But we can drill our own oil and have cheap fuel without another Blame America First president.</p>
