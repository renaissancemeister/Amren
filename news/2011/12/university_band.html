<h1><a href="https://www.jbhe.com/2011/12/university-band-played-dixie-at-lynching-site/">University Band Played &#8220;Dixie&#8221; at Lynching Site</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>JBHE, December 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last month the Missouri State University Pride Band was asked to perform at the dedication of a public park in downtown Springfield. During its performance the band played the song &#8220;Dixie.&#8221; In 1906, three African American men were lynched in the same location.</p>
<p>The president of the local chapter of the NAACP lodged a protest with the university&rsquo;s interim president, Clif Smart. President Smart issued a quick apology and stated that the song will not be played by the band in any public venue in the future.</p>

		<p>Apply this logic outward, and there won&rsquo;t be a spot in America where one will be able to play &#8220;Dixie,&#8221; because the civil rights bunch can find something &#8220;civil rightsey&#8221; about every square foot of land in America.</p>

I work with an elderly black gentleman with whom I get along with very well.</p>
<p>Today on the elevator, he was singing Dixie; something he&rsquo;s done before.</p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of <b>Colored</b> People would love to sit down with this guy and set him straight; not only about Dixie but also some of his opinions about blacks.</p>

		<p>Do the lyrics to Dixie contain calls for rape, robbery, murder and drug dealing gun battles as the typical rap album does? Perhaps a ban on rap in any civilized area should be the response.</p>

		<p>Lots of college bands played Dixie up until the last few years. The University of Arkansas Marching Band brought fans to their feet when they played it. No more. Ole Miss no longer plays it and retired Colonel Reb and the Confederate Flag.  </p>

		<p>Lynching was a form of frontier justice. It was crude, and probably wrong most of the time, but that&rsquo;s just the way it was. History also shows that whites were lynched in numbers nearly equal to blacks, but you&rsquo;ll never hear that from the mainstream media. Ignorance is far easier to perpetuate than the truth. </p>

		<p>Slavery was certainly a sad chapter in the history of western civilization but Christian thought was instrumental in abolishing slavery. And when put in perspective, the black folks who live in freedom should be grateful for that. </p>
<p>Slavery is still alive and well in the Muslim world. In fact, Muslims are encouraged to practice slavery by their Koran, Sira and Hadith, since these books are Allah-breathed and without error and cannot be changed, Muslims are commanded to practice slavery. They enslaved hundreds of millions of peoples from all the countries that they conquered, even caucasians and the enslavement continues to this day.</p>
<p>This should be taught to our schoolchildren. Of 12 million slaves rounded up by Muslims in Africa and exported to North and South America, how many do you think came to America? Your guess is wrong because only 500,000 made it to America, and this White America has been beating itself up for ever since. We need to get over it.</p>

<p>Alternately, he could have responded by simply saying, &#8220;Tough, don&rsquo;t send money or your kids to our school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Playing Dixie in public must be protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p>

		<p>#7 Why do you say that other than sheer brainwashing?</p>
<p>In fact, almost all lynching and other forms of justice were done to people guilty of serious crimes.  Also, it was not, for the most part, done extra-judicially.  Vigilance committees and lynchings, in one form or another, were the original method of meting out justice anywhere outside a major city.  It took quite awhile for &#8220;professionals&#8221; to make their way throughout the entire US and then seize the right of justice from the people to unelected and mostly unaccountable people.  For a time, the two systems competed with each other especially since the formal justice system often refused to mete out appropriate justice due to corruption (hey&hellip;.just like today).  There are few to none incidents of lynchings of innocent people&hellip;.especially blacks.  ESPECIALLY blacks.  Go back and re-read the Color of Crime to get a handle on just how much violent crime is part of being a black person.  How few blacks don&rsquo;t commit serious victim crimes on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Our country (and the entire world) is desperately in need of a return to sane, steady, quick justice.  Most victim crimes should not see the next dawn rise without a hanging of the criminal.  Will the occasional innocent person get hung.  Yeah&hellip;..maybe once in a generation, far fewer than in today&rsquo;s convoluted system.  But for each one, millions of victims that the guilty would have harmed, will be saved.  And very few will choose to be criminals if they understand that the first time they get caught will be the last time.</p>

<p>I wonder if the university president also spoke with president of the local NAAWP?</p>
<p>There was an incident in the news a few years ago concerning an even older news story. Seems african american GIs lynched an Italian prisoner of war, stateside, during WWII. It was in the news because the government was apologizing the usual way they do. The government was groveling before and apologizing to the AA&rsquo;s who lynched the white guy and were then punished. </p>

Oh yes? And what was it they were guilty of? Because they were undoubtedly guilty of something, not nothing. </p>

		<p>As long as BO is prez the NAACP et al will have old whitey on the run at every turn. People are conformist, they put themselves first &amp; grovel to those in power. With a Republican prez people will again have the guts to say NO! I hope.</p>
