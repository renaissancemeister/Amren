			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wall Street Journal, December 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Attorney General last Friday blocked South Carolina&rsquo;s voter ID law on grounds that it would hurt minorities. What a political abuse of law.</p>
<p>In a letter to South Carolina&rsquo;s government, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez called the state law  &mdash;  which would require voters to present one of five forms of photo ID at the polls  &mdash;  a violation of Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Overall, he noted, 8.4% of the state&rsquo;s registered white voters lack photo ID, compared to 10% of nonwhite voters.</p>
<p>This is the yawning chasm the Justice Department is now using to justify the unprecedented federal intrusion into state election law, and the first denial of a &#8220;pre-clearance&#8221; Voting Rights request since 1994.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board that an Indiana law requiring photo ID did not present an undue burden on voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley tells us she &#8220;will absolutely sue&#8221; Justice over its denial of her state&rsquo;s law and that challenge will go directly to federal district court in Washington, D.C. From there it may be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, which would have to consider whether South Carolina can be blocked from implementing a law identical to the one the High Court approved for Indiana, simply because South Carolina is a &#8220;covered&#8221; jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, Mr. Holder&rsquo;s tactics could well doom Section 5 itself. That&rsquo;s a big gamble for the sake of trying to stir up election-year minority voter turnout.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>South Carolina&rsquo;s law, like Indiana&rsquo;s and Georgia&rsquo;s, explicitly addresses potential disenfranchisement by offering state-issued IDs free of charge. When civil-rights groups fretted about the ability of minority voters to get to the local Department of Motor Vehicles to pick up a free state-issued ID card, Governor Haley created an 800 number to offer free rides to anyone who couldn&rsquo;t afford the transportation. About 30 people called.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As African-American men at the most exalted reaches of government, Messrs. Obama and Holder are a testament to how much racial progress the country has made. It&rsquo;s a shame to see them pretending little has changed so they can scare up some votes.</p>

<p>Anyone with the power of observation and deduction can demolish this notion.  Their &#8220;progress&#8221; has been to play off of white guilt.</p>

		<p>For additional expose of the anti-white racism in Holder&rsquo;s Dept. of Justice, read the new book by J. Christian Adams, Injustice.  The new policy of the DoJ is to enforce the Voting Rights Act if the victims of intimidation are minorities; and NOT to enforce it if the victims are whites.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder.  Sometimes I have to show photo ID to return items to stores that I no longer have a receipt for.  Yet these people are too precious to have to produce ID.  They&rsquo;ve had over a year to get one, but they still carry on.  Further proof of what we already know. </p>

		<p>The lawsuit against that part of the VRA will probably have the most merit on 14th Amendment grounds.  Why should certain states, cities and counties have to pre-clear when others don&rsquo;t?  Is foreign espionage a Federal crime in South Carolina but not in Iowa?</p>
<p>Also, you can still vote even if you don&rsquo;t have the required ID.  You&rsquo;ll get a yellow provisional ballot   &mdash;   The catch is that they&rsquo;ll verify your stated personal information before counting the yellow ballot, so they&rsquo;re not viable for voter fraud.</p>

<p>Exactly! Holder [ZANU-PF] and his cohorts are 1000 % wrong about this stuff. Voting is always encouraged but it must be done right and measures taken to prevent fraud. Holder [ZANU-PF] and Obama too are not so much &#8220;black men&#8221; as what used to be called Oreo Cookies. Black on outside, whitey on inside.</p>

		<p>Again, Mr. Holder is just trying to ensure Obama&rsquo;s re-election which will guarantee his job as head of the DOJ. It is self-interest. He knows that his fellow blacks are buffoons and will simply keep up their steadily increasing rates of crime. Why not ensure they get to vote, regardless of their status as felons or otherwise. Also, by blocking this law he ensures that all the illegals that have flooded to SC in the past 20 years can vote for Obongo as well. It is all about &#8220;job security&#8221; for Mr. Holder. </p>
<p>The negative impact on White America is just icing on the cake for Mr. Holder. He is really not as &#8220;devious&#8221; as he is made out to be&hellip;that takes a degree of intelligence that he simply doesn&rsquo;t have. </p>
<p>The same could be said about our current Commander In Chief. His gaffes make the much mocked George W look like a genius by comparison. </p>

		<p>If I want to rent a movie, I have to show ID, Also to buy liquor, drive a car, get a library card&hellip; Why  should a person be allowed to do something as serious and important as VOTE without proving who they are and that they have the right (U.S. citizenship) to do so.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that Holder (and Obama) are worried about the burden that might be placed on voting by blacks and Hispanics.  If an American is worried about showing ID, it can only be because he doesn&rsquo;t have any valid document to present, has fake ID, or is being sought by the authorities.  Many ghetto black men have outstanding warrants or are barred-from-voting felons, and a significant number of Hispanics are illegals.  There&rsquo;s always the chance that a deputy sheriff or city cop might be somewhere around the polls and ask questions.  <br>
South Carolina, like most Southern states, will almost certainly go Republican.  Holder is worried about other states taking the same path.  And he has cause to worry, since more white people will probably go to the polls this time around  &mdash;  and fewer of them will vote for a Prez who keeps white-hater Holder on the payroll.  </p>

		<p>In the one article we read that African Americans lead the world in murder, and likely in drop out rates, low grades, crime, all around bad behavior, in the other article we read that these same African Americans are in complete solidarity with each other. They are respectful of themselves first and of the culture and the contributions they make. It might be added that whites feel a great respect towards African Americans and their culture, although the words in solidarity with African Americans might be a better way to describe it. Must be all that edumacation they receive. </p>

<p>I suspect that their procrastination relates to the fact that they know that their photos reside in other places such as the Post Office and Police Blotters.</p>

<p>I guarantee with an escort of large, physically fit White men, there will be no intimidation from the Black Panthers, and other Thugs, for anyone to investigate. </p>
