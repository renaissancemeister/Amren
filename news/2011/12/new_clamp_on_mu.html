<p class="articleSource">John Masanauskas, Herald Sun, December 3, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Muslims are being urged to report hate crimes under a special disaster plan to deal with the fallout from terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Under the Muslim Emergency Management Plan, backed by the state and federal governments, Victorians will be given advice on how to react to anti-Muslim incidents, even if they are considered minor.</p>
<p>Muslim victims of abuse are encouraged to save evidence, take photos and report any incident to police and their local mosque or Islamic organisation.</p>
<p>And in another initiative, Victoria Police is introducing new strategy to deal with violence and threats motivated by prejudice.</p>
<p>It comes amid growing concern over inter-racial tensions in Melbourne&rsquo;s suburbs and against the backdrop of fears of further terrorist attacks that could strain relations further.</p>
<p>Police are being asked to develop databases on crime motivated by race or religion, so that offenders can be prosecuted.</p>
<p>The &#8220;prejudice-motivated crime strategy&#8221; focuses on crimes linked to race, religion, sex, age, disability or homelessness.</p>
<p>Muslims told the <em>Herald Sun</em> they faced increasing abuse on the streets because of their religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of women get yelled at and told &#8216;Go home&rsquo;, or &#8216;There&rsquo;s no place for you here&rsquo;, especially women wearing the burqa,&#8221; a Muslim source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It happens in shopping centres, at the park or just when you are walking along in the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria director Ross Barnett said the new police initiative was needed.</p>
<p>He said judges had the power to take into account hate-related issues in sentencing, but police were not equipped to provide the evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The elements of the strategy include training for officers, capacity to start collecting data so they&rsquo;ve got a sense of what is happening, how often it happens, and what the extent of it is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Muslim Emergency Management Plan, financed by the state and federal governments, was devised by the Islamic Council of Victoria with support from the Department of Premier and Cabinet&rsquo;s Office of Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship.</p>
<p>Islamic Council general manager Nail Aykan said there was no doubt Muslims would suffer a backlash in the event of a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate crimes can originate from a multitude of matters but in the case of, God forbid, a terrorist attack, of course, you end up with repercussions,&#8221; Mr Aykan said.</p>
<p>State Multicultural and Citizenship Minister Nick Kotsiras said the emergency plan arose from a deal struck by the former Bracks and Howard governments.</p>
