<h1><a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/DREAM-Act-immigration-not-mentioned-in-teen-s-2341291.php">DREAM Act Not in Suicide Notes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynn Brezosky, My San Antonio, December 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The recent suicide of an illegal immigrant fanned the flames of a controversial measure to legalize certain students who were sneaked into the country as children, prompting, among other things, a Friday morning ceremony in Los Angeles and a proclamation on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>But in the 11 pages of suicide notes that Hidalgo County investigators released to the family of Joaquin Luna on Friday, there&rsquo;s not a single mention of immigration or of the failed federal Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, as was mistakenly reported by various news outlets.</p>
<p>Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Treviño said he could not release the notes, which an investigator found in a Bible, until the investigation confirmed the case indeed was a suicide.</p>
<p>&#8220;What really bothers me is that there&rsquo;s somebody out there attempting to exploit this poor young man&rsquo;s decision to commit suicide and try to politicize it with failure of the DREAM Act and immigration issues,&#8221; Treviño said.</p>
<p>Still, family members and supporters said Friday that they believe the pressures of his legal status was a contributing factor to the decision to take his life.</p>
<p>His oldest brother, Diyer Mendoza, said Luna was disappointed when the DREAM Act failed in Congress, as he was about immigration policy battles in Arizona and other states. He said Luna, a high school senior who planned to attend college, also was painfully aware that even with a degree, he wasn&rsquo;t legal to work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mendoza told investigators Luna was growing increasingly despondent as he received letters from top colleges asking him to send documentation of citizenship.</p>
<p>He told local media the same thing. The story went viral, and many pro-immigration groups began using him as a symbol of why the DREAM Act should be passed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Rubén Hinojosa presented his &#8220;Urge Support for the DREAM Act-Honor the life of Joaquin Luna,&#8221; speech to Congress after speaking with family, said Hinojosa&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Patricia Guillermo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposed the DREAM Act, said that whatever the reasons for Luna&rsquo;s decision, using it to try to change national policy designed to limit immigration was reprehensible.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to direct questions to the parents,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You brought your son to this country, you knew that he was going to be living here as an illegal alien &hellip; and yet you did it anyway.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I figured as much.  What 18-year old man commits suicide over a political nuance?  Besides, Obama has already enacted much of the DREAM Act by executive fiat, and Texas has a state level version (thanks, Rickroller).</p>
<p>He probably killed himself for the same reason most young men commit suicide.</p>

		<p>Few American politicians know this amazing fact: Mexico has universities!  Even more astounding is that these Mexican universities accept Mexicans as students.   </p>
<p>Who whould have known? </p>
<p>One other thing is that Mexican universities are very, very inexpensive, compared to American universities.</p>

		<p>80 percent of the suicides in our proudly diverse nation are white men but no one is making an issue of that. </p>

		<p>Just curious, what is the reason most young men in America commit suicide? Is it because they are broke and can&rsquo;t find jobs?</p>

		<p>Exploit is the right term to use here.</p>
<p>I live in Texas and I know of no College or University that will deny a qualified student admission based solely on their legal status. If that were so then why did Texas pass that law granting children of illegal immigrants resident tuition in state colleges.</p>
<p>About the only thing that these people are denied is access to student loans and grants. More than likely he was applying for financial aid and that is probably why he was asked about his status. There are scores of organizations out there that extend grants and scholarships to these people (try shepherding your white American child through college and you&rsquo;ll know what I mean). If you want the education bad enough you&rsquo;ll find a way to pay for it.</p>
<p>Last week I saw an interview on Fox news in which two reps from the Democratic party suggested that anyone who works should be extended the right to vote regardless of legal status.</p>
<p>This whole thing is about creating a new group of Democratic voters nothing more. </p>

		<p>&#8220;But in the eleven pages of suicide notes&#8221;  There was a famous New Yorker cartoon that showed a bearded and sandaled Hippie with a &#8220;World Ends Tomorrow&#8221; sign talking to an editor in his office. He says, &#8220;It started out as a suicide note, then I added a few references to my unhappy childhood, put in a chapter on my many failed romances, told my parents what I thought of their lack of love and  support and NOW I`m talking to you about publishing rights&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Liberals have so few tools to employ in their struggle, and most are becoming less and less useful.  The vast majority of people realize, for instance, that blacks commit an inordinate number of crimes.  Most can perceive that foreign mestizos have a difficult time assimilating into white American culture.  They can see that most homosexuals aren&rsquo;t interested in settling down with one partner in a so-called marriage and raising children.  <br>
This if-you-don&rsquo;t-let-them argument is being used to push every facet of the liberal agenda.  Yet, how many people will be convinced that we need amnesty, same-sex marriage, etc. because one or even 100 people might commit suicide if they don&rsquo;t get it?  Folks kill themselves because their lover left, they got fired, and so on.  And, of course, if a conservative committed suicide because his child did something of which he disapproved, he&rsquo;d get no sympathy from the left.</p>

		<p>I have know of young men that committed suicide just because of a breakup with a girl friend. </p>
<p>Many young people just can&rsquo;t handle disappointment but does this mean they should always get what they want?</p>

The liberal response would be &#8220;Mexico is so bad* that people will kill themselves rather than go back!&#8221; (never mind that most migrants go back-and-forth several times a year). </p>
<p></p>
<p>*(The absolute disaster which is Mexico, though in truth a product of the Mexican people-of all races- is of course blamed not on them but on Whitey: most specifically America&rsquo;s gun lobby and drug users.)</p>
