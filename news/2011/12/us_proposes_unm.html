<h1><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/12/11/us-proposes-unmanned-border-entry-with-mexico/">U.S. Proposes Unmanned Border Entry with Mexico</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, December 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This hardly seems a time the U.S. would be willing to allow people to cross the border legally from Mexico without a customs officer in sight. But in this rugged, remote West Texas terrain where wading across the shallow Rio Grande undetected is all too easy, federal authorities are touting a proposal to open an unmanned port of entry as a security upgrade.</p>
<p>By the spring, kiosks could open up in Big Bend National Park allowing people from the tiny Mexican town of Boquillas del Carmen to scan their identity documents and talk to a customs officer in another location, at least 100 miles away.</p>
<p>The crossing, which would be the nation&rsquo;s first such port of entry with Mexico, has sparked opposition from some who see it as counterintuitive in these days of heightened border security. Supporters say the crossing would give the isolated Mexican town long-awaited access to U.S. commerce, improve conservation efforts and be an unlikely target for criminal operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;People that want to be engaged in illegal activities along the border, ones that are engaged in those activities now, they&rsquo;re still going to do it,&#8221; said William Wellman, Big Bend National Park&rsquo;s superintendent. &#8220;But you&rsquo;d have to be a real idiot to pick the only place with security in 300 miles of the border to try to sneak across.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection, which would run the port of entry, says the proposal is a safe way to allow access to the town&rsquo;s residents, who currently must travel 240 road miles to the nearest legal entry point. It also would allow park visitors to visit the town.</p>
<p>If the crossing is approved, Border Patrol would have eight agents living in the park in addition to the park&rsquo;s 23 law enforcement rangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s actually going to end up making security better,&#8221; CBP spokesman William Brooks said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you&rsquo;ve crossed you&rsquo;re still not anywhere. You&rsquo;ve got a long ways to go and we&rsquo;ve got agents who are in the area. We have agents who patrol. We have checkpoints on the paved roads leading away from the park.&#8221;</p>
<p>A public comment period runs through Dec. 27 on the estimated $2.3 million project, which has support at the highest levels of government from both countries.</p>
<p>But U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican member of the House Homeland Security committee, questioned the wisdom of using resources to make it easier to cross the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to use our resources to secure the border rather than making it easier to enter in locations where we already have problems with illegal crossings,&#8221; McCaul said in an email. {snip}</p>

		<p>Yeah&hellip;this is a GREAT idea. Good job Mr. Obama! Idiot. </p>
<p>The best solution to our immigration problem is to repeal the 1965 Immigration Reform Act and then anyone that &#8220;matches the profile&#8221; of an &#8220;illegal&#8221; is detained. If they are discovered to be an illegal, their home is raided. Anyone found in the home &#8220;without papers&#8221; joins this individual on the train heading south. </p>
<p>How will we enforce this? We use the US military as this &#8220;soft invasion&#8221; is really an act of war. Hear it from their own lips here<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPi7utFwQwI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPi7utFwQwI</a></p>
<p>To expedite this process I suggest we recall our troops from overseas and then invade Mexico and push all the way down to the Panama Canal. </p>
<p>We set up a DMZ and anyone seen trying to again cross the southern US border is shot on sight. </p>
<p>To expedite the &#8220;rounding up&#8221; process, we can raid all construction sites and Lowes/Home Depot parking lots. Anyone found to have knowingly hired an illegal is fined severely, maybe even imprisoned. </p>
<p>To those that screech that this would &#8220;violate civil rights&#8221;, here&rsquo;s a news flash for you&hellip;if you are NOT an American Citizen you don&rsquo;t have ANY &#8220;civil rights&#8221;. No where in the US Constitution or the Bill of Rights does it mention rights for non-US citizens. Find it and I will eat it with no salt or ketchup! </p>
<p>Also for those that say &#8220;our economy will collapse without that cheap labor &#8216;cause White Americans are all too fat and lazy to do the jobs all those &#8216;exploited&rsquo; illegals do&#8221;. Easy solution&hellip;all those unemployed White Americans are given those jobs. If an unemployed White person turns down a job offered to them, any social assistance they are currently receiving is cut off. They work or starve. Simple as that. It is time for some tough love.</p>
<p>Another great idea for a quick and easy work force&hellip;high school kids. Most states allow kids to work as early as 15 years old. It should be mandatory for all these kids to work at least 20 hours a week at one of those jobs the &#8220;illegals&#8221; were doing&hellip;picking fruit, roofing, cleaning hotel rooms, mowing lawns etc to graduate high school. If they go to community college then they have to maintain this 20 hour work week to graduate. </p>
<p>We can also consider that in order for someone to have the right to vote they have to perform one of these jobs for a certain amount of hours. It would be considered &#8220;community service&#8221;. </p>
<p>Just a few ideas.</p>

		<p>How much clearer can it be that Americans have a governing elite, that preaches about human rights of other nations, or lack thereof, etc. but couln&rsquo;t care less about Americans? Legal immigration alone, accounts for over 1 million people a year that enter the U.S. AT A TIME IN WHICH THIS NATION IS IN AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. PS Don&rsquo;t bother telling the Occupy Wall Street people this, they couldn&rsquo;t care less and are in fact, OPEN BORDERS ALL THE WAY AND FOR THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGN NATIONALS IN THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALY. Are we screwed or what?</p>

		<p>If you consider results rather than what the officials say, it becomes quite obvious that many of them are not stupid but rather quite immoral. </p>
<p>Since they are not stupid they know that their policies will result in more illegal drugs and more illegal aliens as well as the importation of the brutal Mexican drug cartel dominance war. </p>
<p>Obviously, they are complicit in the drug trade and only go after non alliance drug traffickers (those not alligned with the interests of elitist billionaire power-brokers) as well as being complicit in the illegal human traffic across the border. </p>
<p>The only logical conclusion is that they are supporting a policy of destroying the United States of America and making a tidy profit as they do it. </p>
<p>Here are some links to some articles and books on elitist (the so-called elites but they are not our best) drug activity. David Guyat has an unfortunate tendency to view the whole thing with a bias of the so-called liberals but there is a lot of factual information there. I used links to amazon only to show you some good books on the subject. You could borrow them from a library or buy them elsewhere if you want. </p>

		<p>Just another part of the big plan. The great American takeover! Sure looks as if our &#8220;leaders&#8221; are going to give the country away, they&rsquo;d look for another first world nation to hand us over to rather than the third world hoards who are displacing us.</p>

		<p>India, considered an under-developed country, has completed thousands of of kilometers of fortified border fences with its neighbors Pakistan and Bangladesh. </p>
<p>Their armed forces who guard the borders are being upgraded with new optics for their weapons, equal to those carried by U.S. troops.</p>
<p>For an &#8216;emerging economy&rsquo;, India surpasses expectations in their ability to complete physical perimeter fencing.  In respect of their borders, they have accomplished much more than the U.S. has on its frontier with Mexico.</p>

		<p>Pres. Obama&rsquo;s administration only deports illegals who commit serious crimes.  And Obama is withdrawing half of the 1200 Natl. Guards troops who were assisting the Border Patrol on border security.<br>
Pres. Obama stated the reason for the withdrawal was that the Defense Dept. could not afford it. However, the Defense Dept. apparently can afford to have 28000 troops on the S. Korean border since 1953, the end of the Korean war. Also America has troops all over the world protecting countries borders but cannot afford to protect America&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>I never voted for Obama and dislike him intensely. But I&rsquo;ll give him credit for the creative ways he is destroying the country. He is good at what he does. If it&rsquo;s bad for our country and traditional culture he is a creative genius. And he also knows Congress won&rsquo;t stop him, especially the Dems. There is hardly a better way to dilute and destroy our culture than unchecked immigration, and Obama excells at that. Who would be surpirsed if he outlawed the border patrol entirely Agents there now know they are big trouble if they don&rsquo;t treat the illegas with kind glove. And the Mexican government really decides what happens there. So I give Obama credit. He wants to destroy our country and he is doing it. And he may even be re-elected. My God, just to think of it makes me sick. But again, you got to give him credit. He said he would change the country. And he is. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Federal authorities are touting a proposal to open an unmanned port of entry as a security upgrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>America will now start to eliminate border security, in order to upgrade border security?  This is beyond parody. The people who govern you are not right in the head, I tell you, and neither are the ones who elected them. </p>
<p>Americans could secure their borders in a heartbeat if they wanted to: Abolish all welfare services to illegal aliens. Deport those already there to wherever they came from. No more anchor babies. Make it a penalty for companies and citizens to hire illegal&rsquo;s, and give them heavy fines or jail sentences if they do so. Build a bolt tight, barbed wired steel fence across the entire border, and have the surrounding areas jam packed with land mines. Bring the military back home where it belongs, and have the soldiers patrol the borders and protect the nation from invasion as they were meant to do. And most important, get rid of those lunatics  in the political offices and elect some leaders with character and integrity, who actually care about the future of the nation and the people who made it what it is/was – white people.  </p>
<p>This makes so much sense, that it will never happen in the America. Somewhere, someday, it will. <br>

<p>Your comment raises an interesting point as to who will have to do the jobs that illegals are doing now. More than likely, a severe labor scarcity will be a boom to the robotic-work mechanization industry. But there is a point that bothers me about your post and it is this:that people such as yourself and Peter Brimelow seem very eager to coerce Native Born White Americans of a certain income class-including their children..as in child labor&hellip;into farm work. Here is my question:will the children of the wealthy be coerced into farm work also? Or will people of a certain income level be able to opt out?</p>
<p>All the dramtic improvements-elimination of child labor-for the Native Born White American working class occured during time periods when labor was scarce..periods of very low immigration.</p>
<p>Some people in this movement see a complete shut-off of nonwhite immigration as an opportunity to exploit Native Born White American Labor..I can assure you it is not going to happen.</p>
<p>The complete shut-off all nonwhite immigration will induce a sever labor scarcity&hellip;this will open the door to a powerfull Native Born White American Labor movement..it will be the end of the coerced wage-slave economy.</p>
<p>As far as the hole in the border fence goes&hellip;just another example of the Obama Adminstration&rsquo;s attempt to bring about the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority as quickly as possible</p>

		<p><i>This hardly seems a time the U.S. would be willing to allow people to cross the border legally from Mexico without a customs officer in sight.</i></p>
<p>A customs officer?  How about a Border Patrol Agent OR the National Guard!:</p>
<p>Dateline, Washington Post, Dec. 12,2011:</p>
<p><i>Blaming budget cuts, the Obama administration early next year will cut the number of National Guard troops patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border by at least half, according to a congressman who was briefed on the plan.</i></p>
<p><i>The National Guard said an announcement will be made by the White House &ldquo;in the near future,&rdquo; but Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who has learned of the plans, said slashing the deployment in half is the minimum number, and he said it will mean reshuffling the remaining troops along the nearly 2,000-mile border.</i></p>
<p><i>In California, that will mean going from 264 Guard troops down to just 14, he said.</i></p>
<p>Is this about illegal votes or destroying our America? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see:</p>
<p>1.  Arm Narco Terrorists   CHECK</p>
<p>2.  DEA laundering Drug Money for Cartels   CHECK</p>
<p>3.  Disarm Americans   IN PROGRESS</p>
<p>4.  Unmanned Border Checkpoints  CHECK</p>
<p>5.  Slash National Guard on Border  CHECK</p>
<p>6.  Reduce and arm Border Patrol  with beanbags against military-grade automatic weapons  CHECK</p>
<p>Time to hang the banner:  MISSION COMPLETED</p>

		<p>Learn from us who are sick and almost weary of heart in the UK.<br>
There has been a long-term agenda of nationhood destruction, which cannot be proclaimed or implemented too obviously.  This has to be done by nibbling round the edges and salami tactics, with assertions, if challenged piecemeal, that these will help or minimise the greater perceived problem. Well, you Americans know this really, better perhaps than we gullible &#8220;mustn&rsquo;t grumblers&#8221; in Britain, but our once &#8220;right little, tight little island&#8221; remains an object lesson, if for instance you study  carefully our immigration experience and &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; legislation from the early 1970s. And now have an academic study (NIESR &amp; OECD)showing that, over the past 14 years, immigration was not an economic attraction so much as the result of government policy changes towards asylum claimants, eastern Europe, and &#8220;friends and families&#8221; seeking to join immigrants already in Britain. There is also a minor trade in bogus marriages, bogus students,&c.;<br>
Same applies to incremental attacks on our manufacturing industry, landscape, cultural heritage and character, monarchy (not your cup of tea in the USA, but still an object lesson in gradual erosion from outside-in), crime prevention &amp; punishment, state education, family values, dope legalisation, etc.  <br>
No &#8220;internet conspiranoia&#8221; is involved: every step can be documented, with the ultimate target becoming obvious as it becomes harder to reverse - though, given outrage, not impossible.<br>
At least you have the right to free speech in the USA, and white people can, and should, share their views and solutions with one another. God Bless AmRenia!</p>

<p>&#8220;Your comment raises an interesting point as to who will have to do the jobs that illegals are doing now. More than likely, a severe labor scarcity will be a boom to the robotic-work mechanization industry. But there is a point that bothers me about your post and it is this:that people such as yourself and Peter Brimelow seem very eager to coerce Native Born White Americans of a certain income class-including their children..as in child labor&hellip;into farm work. Here is my question:will the children of the wealthy be coerced into farm work also? Or will people of a certain income level be able to opt out?</p>
<p>All the dramtic improvements-elimination of child labor-for the Native Born White American working class occured during time periods when labor was scarce..periods of very low immigration.</p>
<p>Some people in this movement see a complete shut-off of nonwhite immigration as an opportunity to exploit Native Born White American Labor..I can assure you it is not going to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not Anon 5:18, but I have posted about farm labor often in the past on Amren articles.  First, it is important to understand the realistic economic scenarios that are involved.  We cannot suppose that eliminating illegal aliens in farm work will cause child labor abuses that you project, because our society will not go that far backward UNLESS there is a huge breakdown world wide that caused most people to NEED to farm in order to survive.  In 1900, most Americans were farmers.  This means that the entire family pitched in to make the farm work, including children, but except in cases of mentality ill adults, children were not expected to slave the way they were in 19th century New England factories for 16 hour days.  Even in the 1950s, many children were raised on farms and had morning chores before and after school.  I might add that this had a positive effect on our greater society.  I picked for extra cash in the 1960s, when many white kids were allowed to sign up and work.  I got my SS card when I was 13 sot that I could pick tomatoes.  I later worked at a restaurant after school in the summer washing dishes and busing tables.  It didn&rsquo;t hurt my schooling, I got on honor roll, and I also made marks athletically.  I think the experience made me more honest.  I was busy while lots of other kids were going to parties on weekends and getting drunk or doing drugs.</p>
<p>As far as privileged classes go, most of the problems of the wealthy come from having too much money and time and not enough work or work ethic.  So short of socialist work camps, a more uniform experience would actually protect the young better than sending them to chaperoned summer camps.  Why does anyone need to play summer games when there is so much good they could be doing, like forest restoration projects, etc.?</p>
<p>In the probable future scenario, child labor will be the least of our worries.  Families and friends will have to cooperate better than they do now, IF they want to survive.  I live in a suburban setting, but I keep a garden and even a few hens.  I can my own produce, and otherwise try to live in a way that reflects a life involved with the real processes of living rather than give time to NBA weekends, Dancing with the Stars, etc.  I have a hobby or two, but they are also related to future possibilities as things are most likely to change for the worst.</p>
<p>The main problem with Mexican farm workers aside from the obvious is that these corporate farmers seem to need a new set of them every year.  Mexicans come to work on farms, but somehow don&rsquo;t stay there, but seep into other lower end jobs like at restaurants and retail.  This displaces many teens from the jobs that used to help give them a head start in life as well as learning a good work ethic.  Today, most seem to be learning that they are not wanted.  That opened up to some very destructive scenarios far worse than a teen working at job because they don&rsquo;t have rich parents.</p>

<p>Some of that is true, but what I think is more likely is that they &#8220;work hard&#8221; and &#8220;keep their heads low&#8221; for the minimum amount of time until they figure out how to work the welfare system, if not that, then become hangers-on to existing Hispanic welfare recipients, or hook up with the nefarious gang/drug crowd.  But you&rsquo;re right in that these farmers keep having to import more and more &#8220;hard working Hispanics&#8221; every year, the type that will do the jobs that &#8220;Americans won&rsquo;t do,&#8221; and not even other Hispanics really want to do.</p>

		<p>Hispanics only have four times our crime rate as opposed to 8 times with blacks.  At the same time, they reproduce at an average of 3.2 kids per woman and have gone as high as 4.4.</p>
<p>What bothers me the most is the certainty that these numbers will provide a demographic change whose outcome _will_ effect the elites as much as the white lower classes from whom they seek release.</p>
<p>And with that, it becomes a matter of demographic time-outs on an aging white population majority vs. what you think will happen in Mexico in the period 2018-2025 as most of the baby boomers begin to slip away.</p>
<p>We are out of time to begin to complain and almost out of time to begin to set up alternative, protected, enclave lifestyles.  </p>
<p>The obvious comparison being the Nazi &#8216;estates&rsquo; in Brazil and Argentina wherein you have German expats that have created entire systems of localized, internally stable, micro societies within the very arms of the swarming hordes of natives.</p>
<p>Will such a system be possible here where legalized ethnic redistribution gives us no homeland of our own?  I doubt it. </p>

<p>I did all the dirty disgusting factory jobs (almost maimed on at least two occasions)..and one month of very poorly paid farm work also to pay for college.</p>
<p>If there are dirty jobs that have to be done in the absence of immigrant scab labor, then there should be a democratic process whereby the Greedy Cheating Class can&rsquo;t avoid doing these jobs.</p>
<p>From an anarchist perspective, the type of work and quality of the work experience is  a very deep question because it touches in a very deep way what it means to be human. I never felt my humanity was enhanced doing  low wage degrading work under the thumb of an abusive foreman. I get the impression that Anon at 5:18 thinks that this kind of work has a deep salubrious effect on ones humanity..I have great doubt&rsquo;s about this. I think what you are writing about is much more similar to what goes on a socialist Israeli Kibbutz.</p>
<p>To the extent that a severe labor scarcity-caused by a massive shutdown of post-1965 immigration policy-would result in the mechanization-robotization of the dirty and dangerous jobs, it would actually open the window for productive meaningful work. The goal should be the liberation of Native Born White American labor..not the degradation of Native Born White American labor..now this would be authentic progress..not the &#8220;progress&#8221; of race-replacement that the war criminal and rapist Bill Clinton advocated in a Princeton University student newspaper in his last year of office.</p>
<p>One of the great evils of the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act is that it  set into motion the massive degradation of Native Born White American Labor..and its going to get a lot worse.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we suffer from massive vote-fraud in the U.S.A. and no election can be considered to be honest. Until electronic voting is eliminated, we do not have even a hope of honest elections. It should not be assumed that those in office have been voted into office. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the &#8220;watchdogs&#8221; of vote-fraud in the early post 2000 years were democrats and they do not care to expose vote-fraud that favors democrats. This vote-fraud is more evidence that there is more going on behind the scenes than the controlled false paradigm. </p>
<p>In addition to the vote-fraud, the two party system does not offer antidotes to this situation (how handy for elitist destroyers of our society!). For the most part, both parties of the Janus-headed monstrocity foisted upon us support pernicious illegal and legal immigraion of incompatible easily manipulated third world populations.</p>
<p>We need a system of multi-party instant runoff elections with verifiable paper trails and intense scrutiny of the voting system to prevent vote-fraud.</p>
<p>Ha det godt! </p>

		<p>This is unbelievable.  </p>
<p>Look for unmanned border crossings to spread.  With Mexican junk trucks now rolling into the heartland, quick entry codes pasted on their windshields will automatically allow them to be waved across the border without checks. Just like many states have now at their &#8220;Ag&#8221; and &#8220;weigh stations&#8221; along state line.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very familiar with the area where this foolishness will take place.  Big Bend has always been my favorite 2nd tier national park.  Plenty of good hiking trails and wonderful camp sites, plus the park is home to a small black bear population as well as lots mountain lions.  With some luck you can see and take photos of both.</p>
<p>The agenda behind an unmanned crossing is simply to harass American citizens who are returning form a visit to the remote Mexican pueblo just across the river.  The crossing mentioned is so isolated the nearest large city is about 200 miles away.  Mexican nationals have no interest in coming across at the park.  At that point there are miles and miles Texas desert to walk across to get anywhere. </p>
<p>In the past if you were in the park you could hitch a ride on a small ferry boat and go over and come back without seeing an authority on either side.  Of course even in one of the most remote areas of the lower 48 the lone citizen must be made to feel the presence of the worthless and incompetent DHS and its evil bastard child CBP (Customs and Border &#8220;Protection&#8221;).  </p>

		<p>Sorry, but it may not really matter anymore. People that want to come in illegally can do that, no problem. If they get caught, they are sent back home so they can try it again the next day. Most illegals get through anyways. </p>
<p>The only thing that will stop this is a lower standard of living and much higher unemployment. </p>
<p>The US really isn&rsquo;t a country anymore by traditional standards. We have no common language, religion, culture, race or really anything. It&rsquo;s more just like an economic zone with a Chamber of Commerce (Washington DC) running the show. </p>
