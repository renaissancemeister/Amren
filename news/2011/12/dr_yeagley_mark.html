<h1>Dr. Yeagley Marks Important Milestone in Suit Against Thugs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Yeagley, American Renaissance, December 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The <em>American Renaissance</em> conference planned for February 2010 had to be cancelled because four successive hotels that had agreed to host the conference were intimidated by &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; thugs. Last August, one of the speakers scheduled for the conference, David Yeagley, filed suit against the &#8220;anti-fascists,&#8221; accusing them of conspiracy and tortious interference with contract (See &#8220;David Yeagley Sues Thugs Who Shut Down 2010 AR Conference,&#8221; AR, October 2011).</p>
<p>Mr. Yeagley has announced that he has already  &mdash;  just four months after filing suit  &mdash;  reached a settlement with one of the defendants, Jeffrey Imm. As a result, he expects no further conflict between Mr. Imm and himself or <em>American Renaissance</em>. Mr. Yeagley says he is now focusing his efforts on the remaining defendants and hopes to achieve similar results. </p>
<p>This is very good news for all champions of freedom of speech and assembly, and for supporters of <em>American Renaissance</em>. The AR conference to be held in Tennessee in March will be at a government facility, which has certain obligations under the Constitution, so will not submit to pressures in the same way a private company would. Moreover, the facility is not likely to face much pressure, thanks to Dr. Yeagley&rsquo;s clear determination to protect his  &mdash;  and our  &mdash;  right to gather and discuss controversial questions. </p>
<p>Dr. Yeagley is no stranger to controversy. He is the great-great-grandson of the legendary Comanche chief Bad Eagle, and his commentaries on American patriotism have so infuriated a few liberal Indians that some have accused him of being an imposter and not really an Indian. Dr. Yeagley has brought libel charges against his accusers. He has all available evidence of his identity, and expects to rout opponents who clearly never researched his background. One even recklessly claimed that Chief Bad Eagle never existed. </p>
<p>Dr. Yeagley has long been involved in the struggle to <em>keep</em> Indian mascots and logos for sports teams. He has always argued that giving Indian names to a team  &mdash;  or to an attack helicopter like the Apache  &mdash;  is a sign of respect for the Indian warrior&rsquo;s prowess and by no means an insult. </p>
<p>In this connection, he recently wrote three open letters to the United Nations in an effort to inspire this international authority to enforce its own conventions. According to Dr. Yeagley&rsquo;s reading of the 1948 UN mandate and the 2007 Declaration of Human Rights, the removal of American Indian images and symbols from public view is one of the acts that constitute genocide.  Dr. Yeagley has pointed out these provisions of basic UN documents to that organization&rsquo;s Special Advisors on the Prevention of Genocide. He has called on the UN to warn the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the National Collegiate Athletic Association that their actions against Indian mascots are a potential crime against humanity. An Oklahoma lawyer has vowed to sue the UN on Dr. Yeagley&rsquo;s behalf if it ignores his appeals.</p>
<p>Please send help.</p>
<p>Being a plaintiff in a lawsuit is burdensome and time-consuming, and we are grateful to Dr. Yeagley for his fight against the people who want to silence us. Dr. Yeagley manages a small, 501(c) 3 educational public charity is by no means a wealthy man. We encourage all those who approve of his action against the &#8220;anti-fascists&#8221; to send a tax-deductible contribution to:</p>
<blockquote>Bad Eagle Foundation
PO Box 75017
Oklahoma City, OK 73147</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Yeagley extends his sincere appreciation to <em>American Renaissance</em> readers who have already contributed to his foundation, and would be deeply grateful for any possible further support. He has said that he sees his cause as &#8220;the preservation of America and of all the precious freedoms it represents,&#8221; and looks forward to further successes in the new year. &#8220;America will be the beneficiary,&#8221; he says, &#8220;both Indian and white.&#8221; </p>

		<p>David is half whitey and half American Indian. And has undergone therapy and treatment for the cancer now in remission [?]! So his appearance as an American Indian spokesman does surprise some. And he does catch a lot of flak but he is related to Bad Eagle and can more than take it. He does better than most. Actually according to his resume one of the most accomplished persons on the planet. And he is not tooting his own horn but merely stating facts.</p>

		<p>Whites and American Indians both have legitimate claims to the land, both ancient and modern. White liberals and blacks have caused almost all of the misery exposed on this site. The Antifa fanatics are borderline racist anyway; they aren&rsquo;t wired like normal people, on a genetic level.</p>

		<p>I have maintained for years, that the best way to stop these thugs (who feel they have a right to dictate to the rest of us and to infringe upon our rights any time they desire) was to hit them in the wallet. AND HARD. </p>
<p>Congratulations to Mr Yeagley and our side. What a great victory. This has really put me in a good mood. Now Mr Taylor, about those thugs in Canada who physically assaulted you and prevented you from speaking, AND those who attempted to prevent you from exercising your rights to free association and free speech at your conferences?</p>

		<p>He won because he goes on the offensive, to bring pain to his attackers, so they will not want to repeat their folly. Americans should learn from this and allow their anger and frustration to give them energy to go after their attackers and bring them down. Shouldn&rsquo;t Amren or it&rsquo;s supporters look into developing the skills needed to go after the thugs? Thugs like that could easily be lured into making incriminating statements and actions, caught on video and then sued and / or arrested. Why will so few fight back? </p>

		<p>A little off topic.  &#8220;Bad Eagle&#8221; is to me the second coolest name I&rsquo;ve ever heard.  Especially for an actual tribal member, not a wanna be.  I like the name anew every time I go to his website.  </p>
<p>The coolest name is that of a great aunt of a friend of mine:  Dolly Dimple Flake.</p>

<p>I wonder if Dr. Yeagley will appreciate that I, an immigrant from India, who shares the same name of the ethnicity &#8216;Indian&rsquo; agrees with his views.</p>
<p>I wish they hadn&rsquo;t changed their name to Native American &#8216;cause anyone who&rsquo;s born here (including my own two kids) are &#8216;Native American.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When I came here in 1985, they were all called &#8216;Indians&rsquo; and I was hopeful that I, an immigrant from India, would get all the goodies that they get from the U.S. government.</p>

		<p>No, Sureesh, neither your children nor &#8220;anyone who&rsquo;s born here&#8221; is a Native American.  Just as Emma West correctly noted that her black verbal attacker could not be English, so do I note that no Hindustani will ever be a Native American.  You may be an immigrant with a green card, an American passport holder of Indian birth, or a citizen of Hindustani descent - i.e. a desi - but you will never be a Native American.  Your pretense of being White in all but skin color grew tiresome long ago, but most here are unwilling to call you out on it.  I&rsquo;ve dealt with far too many obnoxious Indians (those asking me for visas, or those resident in MY country working as cashiers and suspiciously eyeing my coupons or return receipt) to put up with your verbal sleight-of-hand.</p>

		<p>A common tactic of our enemies is to use the corrupt court system against us, to drag us in front of a judge who will punish us financially and ruin our reputations by making us unemployable and  &#8220;known felons.&#8221;   Far past time we turned this nasty little tactic on them.</p>
<p>Wonder what the settlement was with Jeffrey Imm. I hope it was a large, punitive fine, loss of employment, jail or at least probation and forced to undergo sensitivity training as part of his rehabilitation.  Let him be ever known as a law breaker.</p>
<p>Good show and keep it coming.</p>

		<p>One of the most destructive consequences of the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act is that it has 1) increased the scale of prexisting social problems and 2) created ones that didn&rsquo;t even exist within the borders of America. The fascist anti-Native Born White American thugs who are attempting to shut down AR conferences  will have a whole lot of explaining  to do in the event of the racial partioning of the US into separate race-based nation states. They will not be welcomed into the new nonwhite nation states in the former America&hellip;.nor will they be welcomed into the Native Born White American areas of the former America. The &#8220;anti-facists&#8221;  facists will truely be a placeless people without a country..and they are very likely to finally face the full consequences of their race-treason. They truely are a suicidal cabal. Very disturbed people.</p>

<p>Go over to antiwar.com and take a look at my exchange with the Leftists-liberals in Justin Raimondo&rsquo;s &#8220;Setting the Trap&#8221;&hellip;his most recent commentary..read O&rsquo;Raiffeartaigh&rsquo;s,Mike&rsquo;s and Mr. McGuckins comments.

		<p>Re post #1 and the Do&#8221;J&#8221;<br>
The FOIA/Privacy Act/ surely provides a basis for AR/ Dr. Yeagley<br>
to request access to information held in files  AND  to submit<br>
information to any files in the interest of counteracting<br>
&#8220;cookie cut&#8221; &#8220;gerrymandered&#8221; disinformation.  It would likely take a few y-e-a-r-s  to get access.  Contributing potentially corrective information, of course, should not entail any appreciable delays.    The big attainment  in the<br>
long run in these legal actions would be through powers of discovery/ or trial cross examination/ to break into the otherwise concealed actions and motivations of the thugs.  Perhaps (?) no entity in America wishes to get this case defused/de-fanged by monetary settlements more than Eric Holder&rsquo;s Do&#8221;J&#8221;??  Certainly, as an immediate practical matter, accepting settlements is in no way ignominious.   But there<br>
might, also,  be larger fish to fry?   Bare and use the FOIA teeth.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;Native&#8221; means &#8220;born.&#8221; That is why we see nativity scenes at Christmas. It is where Jesus was born. Indigenous Americans would be a better name for American Indians but in truth it is mostly just white or Hispanic multiculturalist crypto-marxist liberal types who are offended by saying &#8220;American Indian&#8221; or &#8220;Indian,&#8221; not the American Indians. Even many American Indian newspapers use the term &#8220;Indian&#8221; not &#8220;Native American.&#8221; I wonder how many centuries or millenia whites will have to have lived here before being considered indigneous, though. Many of my white ancestors came here 400 years ago on literally the next boat after the Mayflower to Plymouth, Massachusetts (1630). </p>
<p>With regard to obnoxious Indian (from India) cashiers, the Quisling imports are very arrogant. It is as simple as that.</p>

		<p>There is a way to donate online, if anyone prefers that.  Go to BadEagle.com, click on the &#8220;Donate&#8221; button, and there is a PayPal arrangement.  I think, however, that you should click on the &#8220;Contact&#8221; button first, and let me know you&rsquo;re using the PayPal.  I keep funds quite separate.  The suit involving American Renaissance is an entirely separate endeavor than the others.  Just thought I&rsquo;d let everyone know.  The P.O. box arrangement is fine, too.  PayPal does charge a fee for its use, you must know.  </p>
<p>Thank you all for previous donations (which really got everything started on this suit), and for whatever you are able to spare at this rather intense time of year&hellip;</p>
<p>By the way, people from India were originally called Hindu.  It comes from their own Sanskrit, &#8220;sindhu.&#8221;  In just means &#8220;river.&#8221; It was the people who lived along the giant river.  The river people.  The people of the river. </p>
<p>The Persians later put the &#8220;h&#8221; in place of the &#8220;s.&#8221;  When the Europeans traveled over that way, the records were written in Latin, and Hindu became &#8220;Indus.&#8221;  The geographic territory was called &#8220;India.&#8221; People, Indian.  However, this is all in LATIN.  </p>
<p>In the English language, &#8220;Indian&#8221; was first used of the indigenous people of the Americas.  &#8220;Indian&#8221; is our premiere historical name, for those who did not previously know of us.  </p>
<p>At that time, India was still referred to as Hindustan, and the people, Hindu.  Their language, Hindi.  It did not mean religion, culture, food, or customs, although all those are included.  It was the people of the river, the Hindu.</p>
<p>I am an American Indian, or, Indian.  It is an offense that a foreign people should come to these shores of late, and try to usurp the historical name of my people.  Not exactly their fault, but, why do they insist on being called Indian, in English, now?  Why not before?  </p>
<p>I, for one, shall always refer to these people as Hindu.   I never refer to myself as Native American, First Nation, Indigenous, or any other such.  Our historical name, in English, is INDIAN.  </p>

		<p>Bravo to #5, Thomas Q.  He is right on the money.  We need to start fighting back, not only through legal actions in the courts, but by collective targeted boycotts, picketing, letters to the editors, letters to the station managers and every other legal means we can think of to be a pain to our enemies.</p>

		<p>Indians from India and the aboriginal tribes in America can both rightfully call themselves &#8220;INDIAN.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way to differentiate the two types of &#8220;INDIANS&#8221; is DOT or FEATHER.</p>
<p>DOTS do not qualify for affirmative action because Indians from India far outscore whites on the SATs, etc.</p>
<p>FEATHERS do because they are a &#8216;historically oppressed minority&rsquo; with a lower than average SAT score.</p>
<p>Sureesh is a Dot trying to get the two types of Indians merged together so that his two high achieving teenage children can qualify for the affirmative action, scholarship, and government goodies set aside for the Feathers.</p>
<p>No wonder liberals won&rsquo;t let him.</p>

Sureesh does not claim to be a native American. He says his CHILDREN who were born here are native Americans, and he is correct, unless you want to chuck the Constitution of the United States, like our enemies are trying to do. If you don&rsquo;t like the 14th amendment (and I don&rsquo;t) we have to work to remove it, not belittle the whole document by ignoring the parts we don&rsquo;t like. <br>
Sureesh&rsquo;s American-born children are American citizens, like it or not. I would much rather live within a community full of Asian-Indian immigrants than a community of Mestizo &#8220;Latinoes&#8221;, or God forbid, a community full of feral African- Americans. At least with the Asians, I would have a better chance of waking up every morning alive and not robbed, raped, beaten and/or killed during the night.</p>

		<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s the scoop on this Jeffrey Imm.  Does anyone know anything about this guy?  Where is he from?  What does he do?</p>

<p>While I think Jeffrey Imm was indeed up to no good, I get the feeling that he isn&rsquo;t the real bad actor.  Imm is a Republican neo-con type who likes to repeat egalitarian slogans every where he posts, especially when he is trolling blogs and sites like AR.  I&rsquo;m surprised National Review hasn&rsquo;t hired him yet.</p>

		<p>Sureesh, you are writing in the English language.  The meaning of words, in English, has its own history.  &#8220;Hindu&#8221; did not originally have a specific meaning other than the name of the people who lived in the river valley.  River people.  People of the river.  </p>
<p>That &#8220;Hindu&#8221; came to have any specific reference to a specific aspect of the culture of the people of the river is historically circumstantial.  It may have developed during the Muslim invasions of India, which classified everything in religious terms.</p>
<p>But,&#8221;Hindu&#8221; is NOT a religion, per se.  It is a people.  Like it or not, that is the correct history.  You are a Hindu.  A river person, by demographic, ethnological identity.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;FEATHERS do because they are a &lsquo;historically oppressed minority&rsquo; with a lower than average SAT score.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that they actually are an historically oppressed minority, so you can remove those quotes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your pretense of being White in all but skin color grew tiresome long ago, but most here are unwilling to call you out on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dot Indians were the first to implement affirmative action to kick down the upper castes. They&rsquo;re very, very relevant to compare to white Americans today.</p>

Ref. 14 (and 4,5,9)<br>
No powerful source has as much at stake in matters like this than<br>
does the liability insurance industry (which has its own enormously penetrating intelligence network collectively used by<br>
most major carriers).  That intelligence network should, in due course, be provided all the otherwise concealed facts of a matter like this. The chief legal minds in the major carriers are capable of seeing beyond the here-and-now &#8220;opportunities&#8221; of outfits like $PLC, etc., into the long range interest that the insurance industry has in defusing this historial  recrudecence of &#8220;cointelpro&#8221;  &mdash;    hence the need for the fullest range of facts to be made accessible to the industry.  Any possibility of a remotely meritorious class action suit would sure seem on target in this respect.  </p>
