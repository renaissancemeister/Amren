					<p>Robert Robb, Arizona Republic, December 21, 2011</p>
					
									
                
                	
	                	<p>The most sensational allegation the Department of Justice has leveled against Sheriff Joe Arpaio&rsquo;s office is that Latinos are four to nine times more likely to be subject to traffic stops than similarly situated non-Latino drivers.</p>
<p>It is also the most important allegation. It appears to provide hard evidence in support of the general claim that the Maricopa County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office is guilty of systemic racial discrimination.</p>
<p>At this point, however, the presumption has to be that the allegation is also based on junk science, since the DOJ refuses to release the &#8220;statistical study&#8221; on which it is based.</p>
<p>The reason for that presumption, paradoxically, is the DOJ&rsquo;s findings letter itself. Another allegation is that the sheriff&rsquo;s office does not keep sufficient data on traffic stops to determine whether racial profiling is occurring.</p>
<p>How can the underlying data be insufficient to determine whether racial profiling is occurring, but sufficient to conclude that Arpaio&rsquo;s office racially profiles more than any other law-enforcement agency in the country?</p>
<p>The DOJ says the sheriff&rsquo;s office &#8220;frequently&#8221; arrests Latinos without cause. What constitutes &#8220;frequently&#8221;? The DOJ doesn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>How does the percentage of wrongful arrests of Latinos compare with that of non-Latinos? The DOJ doesn&rsquo;t say. How does the record of the sheriff&rsquo;s office compare with that of other Valley law-enforcement agencies with respect to wrongful arrests? The DOJ doesn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio, of course, contends that&rsquo;s because the issue isn&rsquo;t really racial discrimination. It&rsquo;s an attempt by the Obama administration to stop him from enforcing immigration laws.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case. Regrettably, however, the Department of Homeland Security strongly bolstered Arpaio&rsquo;s argument when it rescinded the authorization for his office to access federal databases to check the immigration status of those booked in the county jails.</p>
<p>This is the one immigration-enforcement program of Arpaio&rsquo;s that incontestably is implemented in a racially neutral fashion. The immigration status of everyone booked is checked. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made it clear that I think Arpaio is running a rogue agency. {snip}</p>
<p>In my book, Arpaio wears a very black hat, and it would be great if some good guys chased him out of town.</p>
<p>At this point, however, it&rsquo;s far from clear that the Obama administration is wearing the white hat in this story.</p>
