			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Hosenball and Samuel P. Jacobs, Reuters, December 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A direct-mail solicitation for Ron Paul&rsquo;s political and investment newsletters two decades ago warned of a &#8220;coming race war in our big cities&#8221; and of a &#8220;federal-homosexual cover-up&#8221; to play down the impact of AIDS.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The letter urges readers to subscribe to Paul&rsquo;s newsletters so that he could &#8220;tell you how you can save yourself and your family&#8221; from an overbearing government.</p>
<p>The letter&rsquo;s details emerge at a time when Paul, now a contender for the Republican nomination for president, is under fire over reports that his newsletters contained racist, anti-homosexual and anti-Israel rants.</p>
<p>Reports of the newsletters&rsquo; contents have Paul&rsquo;s campaign scrambling to deny that he wrote the inflammatory articles.</p>
<p>Among other things, the articles called the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. a &#8220;world-class philanderer,&#8221; criticized the U.S. holiday bearing King&rsquo;s name as &#8220;Hate Whitey Day,&#8221; and said that AIDS sufferers &#8220;enjoy the attention and pity that comes with being sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paul has said that he is not sure who wrote the articles that were published under his name. He has said the articles do not reflect his views, and noted that his public stances  &mdash;  supporting gays in the military for example  &mdash;  have run counter to the incendiary statements in the newsletters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The letter promoting Paul&rsquo;s newsletters was written about 1993. It was during a period in which Paul  &mdash;  who left Congress in 1985 after serving about eight years  &mdash;  returned to Washington after a decade&rsquo;s absence.</p>

		<p>Best theory on the author is Lew Rockwell, whose libertarianism used to be racial enough such that his column was in the CofCC newspaper.  Now you can&rsquo;t even get him to acknowledge that his old pre-1997 &#8220;racially tinged&#8221; writings.</p>
<p>I know the long knives are out for Ron Paul, and once he became the or a co-front runner in Iowa, everyone knew that the people who would directly and financially benefit from a war with Iran, or benefit from other sorts of government spending Paul wants to cut, would haul out the long knives.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re playing with fire if they think they can torpedo RP with this newsletter business.  In reality, they&rsquo;re giving him a really easy road to victory.  Or to put it inb baseball terms, they&rsquo;re risking the heat over the top of the plate   &mdash;   Usually the batter strikes out, but sometimes, he whacks it over the straightaway fences.  All RP would have to do is either acknowledge that he wrote these words, or endorse their content if he didn&rsquo;t, and he would have the nomination instantly locked up.  White people don&rsquo;t like black crime and riots and Martin Luther King.  You really run a risk when you throw your hundred mile an hour fastball right over the heart of the plate.</p>
<p>Ron Paul will never do this, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Too bad that Ron Paul did not say these things. As for MLK, Paul supported the holiday in his &#8220;honor&#8221;. He actually thought MLK was a good and decent man and the Civil Rights bill was a good thing.</p>
<p>I am fed up with Whites running the other way when it comes to truths about race and the INTENTIONAL harm it is actually doing to Whites worldwide. Why are they all such cowards when it comes to honesty about the racial problems facing us? We will have to face the truth one of these days and it is better to do it now before our numbers dwindle to about 5% on this planet.</p>

		<p>Oh boy, the knives are coming out now.  I like Ron Paul, but I do not trust in his philosophy of objectivism/libertarianism.  It&rsquo;s open borders insanity with the notion that all those illegals are avid readers of Hayek, Friedman, and Von Mises.  Libertarians deny the reality of race and culture.  As such, they ignore that a multicultural country does NOT nourish people who prize real individualism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against the idea of man working for himself to create his own life an family.  I&rsquo;m not against a man making a buck.  Making an HONEST buck is deeply vital and virtuous. But there are more important things than profit. Once you trade the honest man for the quick buck, you will have neither.  THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HONEST MEN.</p>

		<p>Martin L. King was a pervert and a rapist. His records were sealed by the FBI for 50 years. There is nothing in those &#8220;racist writings&#8221; that are untrue. Dr. Paul probably did not have anything to do with that particular article, but if he did, I would support him even more fervently than I already do!</p>
<p>By the way, I have read very credible articles stating that Malcolm X was a homosexual prostitute. Some even written by other blacks. The authors of these articles have a lot of evidence to back this up. Amazing how the MSM avoids these stories like the plague. </p>

		<p>It does not change my plans to continue voting for him! Hugo L. Black started off as a Ku Klux Klansman. Then he was voted in as U.S. Senator. Then he was appointed as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. He did his job just fine!!  As a matter of fact, one of his dissenting opinions dated around 1938 is used in my You Tube video posted yesterday entitled &#8220;Con of corporate personhood&#8221;.  Justice Black wrote that he did not believe a corporation is a &#8220;person&#8221; within the 14th Amendment because they never mentioned it during the constitutional amendment debates.</p>

<p>Yes, Rockwell wrote the same type of things in the old Rothbard-Rockwell Report. It was definitely him.</p>
<p>But if you look at LewRockwell.com now it is hard left on race. An article today by Tom DiLorenzo criticizes National Review for once supporting apartheid South Africa and for saying a (somewhat) respectful word about David Duke in 1991.</p>
<p>An article yesterday was subtitled &#8220;the real immigration problem.&#8221; You guessed it - the real illegal immigration problem is that there are supposedly a few thousand illegal Americans living in Mexico.</p>
<p>Murray Rothbard was a much better writer than Rockwell. Rothbard did not hide his support for Jared Taylor and Sam Francis and would not have run away from his words.</p>

		<p>The shameless Neocon attack machine has been desperately trying to make hay of this for weeks now. Between the lefties and the Neocon-men, they are obviously terrified by Paul&rsquo;s popularity. Seems the left and &#8220;right&#8221; of mainstream politics are far more similar than not, doesn&rsquo;t it? Gee, what a surprise&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sink or swim time for Ron Paul. He could show some real courage and take the bull by the horns and admit out loud that he did indeed say these things. And meant it. If he backs off and apologizes he&rsquo;s through (as far as my vote counts).<br>

		<p>#1 Ron Paul will not admit writing or even supporting these. He won&rsquo;t because his campaign staff are clever.</p>
<p>Let me explain&hellip;.</p>
<p>Paul looses all black, bleeding heart liberal whites and hispanic votes if he admits.<br>
While he may gain or solidify many white votes he has no need to try appealing to these white people. These white people have nowhere else to go. They will never vote democrat so he has their votes regardless.</p>
<p>I for one (although I don&rsquo;t have a vote as I&rsquo;m not American) hope Paul denies it and says absolutely nothing more about it. That is the best play.</p>

<p>Ron Unz, open borders, of all people, has archived all the old 3R newsletters.  This part from the July 1994 issue is where I first heard of Sam Francis.  The salient point here is that Lew Rockwell can run, but he can&rsquo;t hide.  No un-ringing a bell on the internet.</p>
<p>Now, Rockwell is against Joe Arpaio, and steadfastly opposes any &#8220;extra&#8221; law enforcement tactics and attention to blacks and Hispanics.  Back in those days, though, while he was still the doctrinaire libertarian, he muted the puritanical aspects of his own ideology.  He even supported PJB&rsquo;s Presidential campaigns, (&#8220;in spite of PJB&rsquo;s non-libertarian imperfections&#8221;), because he was practical and realistic and knew that PJB was the most credible chance for the most change toward anything appearing to be libertarian on the Federal level, in a utilitarian verve.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that these pronouncements likely appeared in the news letter in the first place in order to &#8216;bash&rsquo; folks, those the Paul organization doesn&rsquo;t agree with. Even this is used instead to bash a bit on Ron Paul. If you&rsquo;re on the right, belittling or demeaning others isn&rsquo;t really an option. It seems to Only work the other way around. When folks on the other side of the political spectrum are corrected it is usually done by those also on the left. Joseph McCarthy may have been the last one on the political right able to &#8216;frighten&rsquo; or take to task those who didn&rsquo;t agree with him. The left does this as business as usual, almost as SOP.</p>

		<p>Warnings of a race war in 2012?  I thought that it had been going on for 40 years.  It became outwardly violent since Obama&rsquo;s election in 2008.  Will it escalate?  Most probably yes.</p>
<p>Also, remember the FBI Gang Assessment Report.  Gangs in the military have been shipping weapons and even small ordinance to Mexican drug cartels.  Latino Children in Southwestern states have been taught that the land was stolen from them and the need for a new &#8220;San Diego Plan.&#8221;  Latino spokesman said last summer that there will probably be a race war/civil war in America within 5 years.  All anyone need do is reiterate these facts in a newsletter.  It isn&rsquo;t racism, it&rsquo;s reporting recorded facts.</p>

What&rsquo;s troubling about this is that this was likely leaked by a Republican operative.</p>
<p>Equally troubling is how Gingrich is using this against Paul. </p>
<p>If any Republican uses this, it will only make it worse for them in the future leading to greater scrutiny, declarations of &#8220;I am not a racist&#8221;, and insufferable pandering.</p>

		<p>Now, Newt Gingrich is making hay out of these newsletters.  Before he does any of that, he ought to be concerned about actually getting on the ballot in important primary states   &mdash;   He won&rsquo;t be on the Missouri or Virgina ballots, and a few other states.  The Rickroller missed VA, also.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ron Paul, too &#8220;wacky&#8221; and &#8220;foil headed&#8221; to win, hasn&rsquo;t yet missed a filing deadline, IIRC.  Romney hasn&rsquo;t, either.</p>
<p>Which makes me wonder:  Does Newt Gingrich (et al) really want to win?  Are they really in it to win it?  You would think that ballot access would be the first thing they tend to.  Somehow I get the feeling that other than Romney and Ron Paul, most of the rest are in it for nothing more than resume enhancement slash publicity stunt slash tripling their future speaking fees slash getting a show on the Fox Noise Channel if they don&rsquo;t have one already.</p>

		<p>A race war in the traditional sense is never going to happen as many have prognosticated for decades.  The race war is already being fought daily and has been since the 60&rsquo;s.  Its an insidious war for resources, economic deference, political control and societal realignments.  In this war the whites are and have been losing badly since it began.  Now if there ever was a race war in the traditional sense the whites would easily win out and that&rsquo;s another reason why that will never happen.     </p>

		<p>Ron Paul has always opposed the 1964 Civil Wrongs Bill, the public accomodations and EEOC sections. In 2004 he was the only Member of the House to vote against a resolution hailing the 1964 law on its 40th anniversary. <br>
Paul knows that MLK was an avowed Marxist Socialist with Communist Party USA advisers.<br>
The sit-ins were NOT peaceful, they an initiation of force against private property.<br>
Lew Rockwell did write those newsletters. Lew even hailed the LAPD beating of Rodney King in an LA Times op-ed at the time.<br>
So did Murray Rothbard and Randian Leonard Peikoff.<br>
Those newsletters are great, Ron is stupid to disvow them.</p>

<p>I beg to differ:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/Ym7l5" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/Ym7l5</a></p>
<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s wall separated church and the federal government only. By incorporating the First Amendment non-establishment provision into the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Black&rsquo;s wall separates religion and civil government at all levels  &mdash;  federal, state, and local.</p>
<p>By extending its prohibitions to state and local jurisdictions, Black turned the First Amendment, as ratified in 1791, on its head. A barrier originally designed, as a matter of federalism, to separate the national and state governments, and thereby to preserve state jurisdiction in matters pertaining to religion, was transformed into an instrument of the federal judiciary to invalidate policies and programs of state and local authorities. As the normative constitutional rule applicable to all relationships between religion and the civil state, the wall that Black built has become the defining structure of a putatively secular polity.</p>

Since the election of President Obama the rate of violent crime has continued a decline it began in 1991. There has not been a black ghetto riot of any significance since the Rodney King riots of 1992.<br>
 <br>
<a href="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm</a><br>
 <br>
Blacks still have a rate of violent crime that is about eight times the white rate, but things are getting better not worse. We are not headed in the direction of a race war. <br>
 <br>
The main problem facing the white middle class is the decline in middle class incomes while the rich get richer.  <br>

		<p>The Republicrats have done themselves a great disservice by bringing up the newsletters in an attempt to slander Paul. While being a racial realist is publicly unacceptable, voting is a private affair, and in the end most of the content in the newsletters voters agree with! All these claims of racism do is slightly slow the spreading popularity for Ron Paul by making it risky to speak openly about him. I promise you that this will not stop paulbots, who are multiplying everyday. He will win the primaries. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, I suggest you head to Iowa or NH and witness the army of young adults fighting for him like their lives depend on it. These include whites, blacks (who benefit from his stance on the drug war) Asians, and Latinos (who will be receiving the murdering end of Eric Holder&rsquo;s Fast and Furious for decades to come). </p>
<p><br>
Lets be honest here. In their heart of hearts, every Republican knows that if Romney wins the nomination Ron Paul will run third party and split the Republican vote giving Obama the nomination. </p>

		<p>Several thoughts here:</p>
<p>1. The same people who are smearing Ron Paul over this newsletter thing are the same people who extol the virtues of diversity, yet live in quite non-diverse neighborhoods and send their kids to quite non-diverse schools, like the Clintons and Obamas who, for all their support of diverse public schools, sent their kids to private schools. (Maybe they wanted to send their kids to the public schools, but the Secret Service didn&rsquo;t think it was a good idea because the students were better armed than they were!)</p>
<p>2. Libertarianism and the kind of limited government that our Founding Fathers created and Ron Paul supports does not mix with diversity. It works best when its constituents have a strong sense of personal morality and responsibility, as well as a strong sense of community and stick-togetherness. History shows that diversity ultimately leads to conflict, which necessitates a bigger, more repressive government to keep things peaceful: Witness what happened in Yugoslavia when the communist dictatorship fell. </p>
<p>3. Uncontrolled immigration is perhaps the biggest threat to our national security. All of the 9-11 terrorists were in the country illegally. People come from Iran, North Korea, and China to study nuclear physics in our universities and steal our technical know-how. Our southern border is a war zone, and terrorists tried to sneak in from Canada on New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2000. Our troops will better protect us from terrorism by being on our borders than in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>4. I would support ANY candidate who would pledge to close the borders, station troops on the borders, put a 10-year moratorium on LEGAL immigration, and free our economy from burdensome taxes and regulations to make it bloom and thus require fewer people to depend on Uncle Sam to make ends meet. Trouble is, I have yet to find that candidate.<br>

<p>Mr. Engelman,</p>
<p>While there may have been no black riots to equal the one in 1992, certainly you must agree that black mob attacks on whites (and to a certain extent east Asians) have become quite common these days. The &#8220;flash mob&#8221; attacks that we have all seen on the news. Furthermore, while I have not checked your stats that the overall crime rate has receded to 1991 levels, you must admit that even if the overall rate is down as you state, this statistic can be greatly skewed if blacks and Hispanics have refocused their violent activity away from each other and towards whites. </p>
<p>So I would say to you, who cares if the overall rates are down? In fact, I would not count crips killing bloods killing MS-13 to be crimes, but merely people eliminating themselves. But attacks on honest, hardworking, productive citizens by ghetto dwellers&hellip;that is real crime, and I believe that type of crime has greatly increased and has even been encouraged (underhandedly, of course) under Obama and Holder.</p>

		<p>MLK is also a known plagiarist. Even the New York Times admitted it. His dissertation at Boston University comes with a warning to the reader that much of it is plagiarized. A committee on the subject determined that MLK plagiarized most of his speeches as well and that he does this freely and a lot. Check it out. </p>

		<p>Ron Paul is the only one getting my vote.  I&rsquo;m not interested in anything the other Republicans are offering now, except stopping illegal immigration, but even now they&rsquo;re not following through because they want the &#8216;hispanic&rsquo; vote and because big businesses hire illegals and will vote for the GOP.  I will not vote for any of the GOP unless it&rsquo;s Ron Paul or Pat Buchannan, or someone of their caliber.  I&rsquo;m not &#8216;throwing my vote away&rsquo; at the two traditional parties who are offering us nothing and have done nothing positive for us.</p>

		<p>John Engelman is wrong on all his assertions. Since Obama and Holder Black crime has increased all across the country starting with the ongoing pack gangs looting businesses. In many cities like Oakland only about half the crimes are even reported. <br>
There have been Black riots at the Wisconsin State Fair this year and many other venues. In fact the increasing Black crime and general sociopathology constitutes an ongoing riot across urban America. <br>
Engelman cites standard leftist sources like the New York Times which lied on everything from ML King to Joe McCarthy to the AlGorean warming hoax and of course the Times supports the Keynesianism and government interventionism which have brought the economy to the current depression where the actual unemployment is double the official rate.<br>
While I disagree with Paul on abortion his economic program is the only one that is going to save the nation. The very notion of any sort of equality, social or economic, is Marxian to the core. But minorities will benefit from abolishing the minimum wage, curtailing labor union barriers to jobs, abolishing the drug war en toto and abolishing all the regulations and taxes that prevent economic growth. Four more years of Obama and this country will look like something out of Atlas Shrugged. </p>

		<p>   In the late eighties and early nineties I worked long rural routes . My AM radio was my only companion, it was where I got my news . I distinctly remember the controversy going on over the Feds changing how crime stats would be tabulated in such a way that it would show a decrease in crime when there had not really been one .</p>
<p>   Now every time I turn on the news another woman or child has gone missing or another mass murder has occurred and violent crime is down ? .You&rsquo;d better take anthing the FBI or any of the other Feds tell you with a grain a salt . They definitely seem to have a conflict of interest with the truth .</p>

		<p>A few more points.</p>
<p>1.  Rothbard and Rockwell hoped to tap into what they thought was the latent race-realism of mainstream conservatives.  It&rsquo;s not clear how sincere they ever were. In any case, Rockwell and Paul are now indistinguishable from the hard Left on race.  Even by the end of the &rsquo;90s, I remember listening to libertarians argue that if only cities had private police forces, poor Rodney King would never have had to suffer the way he did.</p>
<p>2. Uncontrolled immigration is not only the biggest threat to national security, as BAW says, but to our national identity.  Ron Paul&rsquo;s position on illegal immigration is abysmal.  Check out  the ratings of the candidates at numbersusa.com.  Yeah, shrinking government might eliminate some of the incentives for illegals, but tho&rsquo; they&rsquo;re happy to take advantage of govt.-subsidized benefits, like free health care at ERs, most come for the jobs.  If Paul did win and revive the economy, the invasion would resume.</p>
<p>3.  You don&rsquo;t have to be a neocon to appreciate that Iran is a threat to the US.  Watch what happens to oil prices and the global economy after Iran goes nuclear.  Even the establishment-Left, pro-Palestinian Foreign Affairs wants to take down the regime in Tehran. </p>
<p>4.  Poster #25 is right: If Paul does well enough in the early primaries, he&rsquo;ll be tempted to run as a 3rd party candidate, giving us 4 more years of Obama.  RP fans on this site need to think about that.</p>

 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
My statistics on crime come from FBI, Uniform Crime Reports.<br>
 <br>
<a href="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm</a><br>
 <br>
Although not all crimes are reported I am confident that crimes against whites are more likely to be reported than crimes against blacks and Hispanics. I suspect that Hispanics who are here illegally are reluctant to report crimes against them. <br>
     <br>
The crime that is most likely to be reported is the murder rate. Disappearances and dead bodies come to the attention of the police. The murder rate is a good way to evaluate the over all crime rate. In 1980 the murder rate in the United States per 100,000 inhabitants was 10.2. In 1991 it was 9.8. In 2010 it was 4.8. The decline has continued during the administration of President Obama. <br>
 <br>
The FBI reports do not distinguish between black and white crimes. However, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, &#8220;In 2005, [murder] rates for blacks were more than 7 times higher than the rates for whites.&#8221; The Bureau of Justice Statistics also documents that the black murder rate was much higher in 1980 and 1991. <br>
 <br>
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/race.cfm  <br>
 <br>
In &#8220;The Color of Crime,&#8221; Jared Taylor reported, &#8220;Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a white than vice versa, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery.&#8221;<br>
<a href="https://archive.colorofcrime.com/colorofcrime2005.html" rel="nofollow">https://archive.colorofcrime.com/colorofcrime2005.html</a><br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, I am confident that the rate of black on white crime has been declining like the overall crime rate. If it does not seem that way, that is because the internet gives greater publicity to whatever sort of events one is looking for. Also, the news media may becoming more willing to report the races of criminal suspects and crime victims. </p>

		<p>In response again to John Engelman, tax cuts by JFK caused the 60s boom, tax cuts by Ronald Reagan caused the 80s boom, tax cuts by George W. Bush caused the 90s boom out of the Clinton crash of 2000, tax cuts after WW2 caused the 40s and 50s boom.<br>
Tax increase by Bush Sr. caused the early 90s depression.<br>
Tax increases during the New Deal prolonged the depression until WW2.<br>
The only downside to the Reagan and Bush 2 tax cuts was the huge, unnecessary increase in &#8216;defense&rsquo; spending, aka Pentagon Socialism with its 5 trillion price tag since both Iraq wars.<br>
Paul opposes the neocons on this.<br>
Unless you believe that government can spend more wisely than you<br>
and private businesses, it&rsquo;s self-evident that the more of a person&rsquo;s earning they get to keep the better they are and the economy is.<br>

		<p>The New York Times has been a leftist rag for more than a century.<br>
There are several books that document the relentless lying of the Times on race, Communist infiltration of FedGov, AlGorean hoax, the Middle East, Mao and Castro just for starters. <br>
The only prestige it has is among LibDems, Socialists, Black racists, discredited Keynesians and NPR listeners. Next to The Washington Post it is the most sinister Left Establishment rag in the world and it has lost so many readers that Sulzberger has said he might shut down the print edition in 2015.<br>
The Wall Street Journal has consistently supported all the Reagan and Bush 2 tax cuts and has had many pieces on the exploision of prosperity during the 80s after the tax cuts.<br>
That family income was lost during Reagan is a standard leftist lie. Bush 2 inherited Clinton&rsquo;s economic collapse. <br>
Those FBI stats are notoriously 3-5 years behind as I well know from research on them. Half the crimes are not reported to the local police who are the source of all FBI crime stats.<br>
My wife is the local neighborhood crime prevention coordinator with the Oakland Police. The OPD acknowledges most crimes don&rsquo;t even get reported and when they do the Liberal Democrats who run the Alameda County DA&rsquo;s drop most of them.<br>
Obama and Holder have created a climate that encourages Black lawlessness. As you well know from reading AmRen.<br>
The New York Times stands for the opposite of everything AmRen does and I&rsquo;m sure both sides would acknowledge this fact.<br>
The economy collapsed under LBJ and Carter. For a while Clinton followed more GOP economic policies while pretending to be a New Democrat but the Fed&rsquo;s irresponsible expansion of money which helped Clinton win in 1996 eventually burst its bubble and NASDAQ<br>
collapsed in March, 2000.<br>
The Democrat Party since Wilson has been a statist-collectivist party to the core. The GOP isn&rsquo;t much better except a few like Paul.<br>

Over the past 100 years, there have been three major periods of tax-rate cuts in the U.S.: the Harding-Coolidge cuts of the mid-1920s; the Kennedy cuts of the mid-1960s; and the Reagan cuts of the early 1980s. Each of these periods of tax cuts was remarkably successful as measured by virtually any public policy metric.<br>
 <br>
- Arthur Laffer<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
I do not have statistics for tax receipts during the administrations of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. I do now that the national debt declined during those years. This was largely because of cuts in the defense budget. During the Reagan administration the defense budget and the national debt both increased dramatically. <br>
 <br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_by_U.S._presidential_terms" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_by_U.S._presidential_terms</a><br>
 <br>
If it was necessary to raise defense spending during the Reagan administration it was necessary to raise taxes to pay for it. Because the Soviet Union was losing its War in Afghanistan while collapsing internally it was not necessary. <br>
 <br>
The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis has compiled data for fluctuations in the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) from 1920 to 2002. GDP during these years is reported in terms of 1996 dollars here:<br>
 <br>
<a href="http://www.singularity.com/charts/page99.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.singularity.com/charts/page99.html</a><br>
 <br>
When Warren G. Harding was inaugurated in 1921 the per capita GDP was $5,758. Eight years later during Calvin Coolidge&rsquo;s last year in office, this had grown to $7,439. This represents a growth of $1,681.<br>
 <br>
The stock market crash of 1929 and the decline in the per capita GDP during the administration of Herbert Hoover has usually been blamed not only on President Hoover&rsquo;s economic policies, but the policies of presidents Harding and Coolidge, when the Republican Party dominated the country. My argument does not depend on that assertion, however.<br>
 <br>
In 1933, when Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated, the per capita GDP was $4,804. In 1936, at the end of President Roosevelt&rsquo;s first term this had grown to $6,423. This represents a growth of $1,619. In other words, there was nearly as much economic growth during Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s first term in office as during the two terms of Warren G. Harding, and Calvin Coolidge.<br>
 <br>
From 1921 to 1928 the top tax rate declined from 73 percent to 28 percent. From 1933 to 1936 it rose from 63 percent to 79 percent.<br>
 <br>
<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=213" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=213</a><br>
 <br>
From 1921 to 2000 we had Republican presidents for 40 years, and Democratic presidents for the other 40. By repeating the kind of calculations I have just done one can find that there was over twice as much growth in the per capita GDP, when the top tax rate was usually higher.  </p>

Over the past 100 years, there have been three major periods of tax-rate cuts in the U.S.: the Harding-Coolidge cuts of the mid-1920s; the Kennedy cuts of the mid-1960s; and the Reagan cuts of the early 1980s. Each of these periods of tax cuts was remarkably successful as measured by virtually any public policy metric.<br>

<p>Can it be said that cutting taxes generates more tax revenue than not cutting them, or raising them? The Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution has provided charts that document the total income tax receipts and the top tax rates from 1934 to the present. These can be found here: <br>
      <br>
<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=213" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=213</a> and here:  <br>

     <br>
     Unfortunately, the income tax receipts are not adjusted for inflation. Therefore, they are only meaningful within a span of a few years. Nevertheless, the charts enable us to see the relationship between tax rates for the rich, and the income tax receipts. <br>
     <br>
     When Reagan was elected the top tax rate was 70%. By 1989 that was reduced to 28%. Tax receipts did increase during the Reagan administration. They also increased during the Carter administration. During the Carter years tax receipts increased by an average of $21,610.75 million a year. During the Reagan years this declined to an average of $19,971.625 million a year.<br>
 <br>
Republicans like to talk about the beneficial effects of tax cuts promoted by President Kennedy. Well, let&rsquo;s see. In 1964 the top tax rate was reduced from 91% to 77%. Tax receipts increased from $47,588 million to $48,697 million. That was less than the increase the previous year, when the top tax rate had not declined. In 1965 the top tax rate was reduced to 70%. There was a meager increase in tax receipts to $48,479 million. In 1969, when the top tax rate climbed to 77%, tax receipts rose to $87,249 million.     </p>

At the bottom of the essay you linked to I found this:<br>
 <br>
Arthur B. Laffer is the founder and chairman of Laffer Associates, an economic research and consulting firm. This paper was written and originally published by Laffer Associates. The author thanks Bruce Bartlett, whose paper &#8220;The Impact of Federal Tax Cuts on Growth&#8221; provided inspiration.<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
This is what Bruce Bartlett has written about taxes in &#8220;Forbes&#8221;:<br>
 <br>
Next week is April 15, the day when most Americans have to file their federal income tax returns. To protest the allegedly high level of taxation in the United States, various right-wing groups are organizing tea parties around the country in the spirit of the Boston Tea Party of 1773&hellip;<br>
 <br>
The truth is that the U.S. is a relatively low-tax country no matter how you slice the data&hellip;<br>
 <br>
One may wonder how working people manage to pay so much in taxes in other countries. The answer is that they get a lot back from the government in other ways.<br>

To these young people Ron Paul provides that hope and change with substance to back it up as well. This is what makes Ron Paul such a strong contender against Obama; he takes away the army of youthful left leaning libertarian supporters from Barry O. while maintaining a strong Republican following as well. </p>

		<p>It seems as if there was some good race realist thinking contained in these newsletters, along with some more crass material.  It is all still a little mysterious   &mdash;   Ron Paul unlike say Pat Buchanan seems to have never expressed any explicitely pro-white sentiment anywhere else in his political career.  </p>
<p>It would be good if Jared Taylor did a &#8220;Special to AR&#8221; report on this current imbroglio.  Three things seem certain: 1) Ron Paul will end up apologizing profusely but to no avail; 2) his support among WHITES will drop significantly as a result of this controversy; and 3) not one single person on any mainstream media outlet will defend ANY of the allegedly &#8220;controversal&#8221; statements related to race contained in the newsletters.     </p>

In 2008 Barack Obama clearly ran as a statist, promising to introduce universal health care. Libertarians of any age group who voted for him were delusional.<br>
 <br>
Thank you for that link. This is what I found in it:<br>
 <br>
&#8220;In 2012 preview, Barack Obama holds moderate lead over &#8216;generic&rsquo; Republican, but ahead of potential Republican challengers by double digits. With the general election under one year away, Barack Obama leads a proposed match-up against &#8216;the Republican Party&rsquo;s candidate for president&rsquo; by six percentage points (35%-29%), a smaller margin than found in February IOP polling (twelve percentage points; Obama: 38%-Republican: 26%). On college campuses, the match-up is a statistical dead-heat (Obama: 37%-Republican: 34%). When Obama is matched against specific candidates, he leads Mitt Romney by eleven percentage points (37%-26%) and Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry (39%-23%) by sixteen percentage points.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
The survey did not mention Ron Paul. Every poll I have seen taken in December places him behind Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, and further behind the President.  <br>
 <br>
A lot can happen between now and next November. Right now the crime rate has continued a decline it began with he election of Bill Clinton, the unemployment rate is declining, and the international situation is improving. Most Americans do not remember the Bush administration as a bountiful time in their lives. </p>

		<p>Government as such produces nothing. It can only give you back what it has already taken from you or someone else.<br>
 <br>
Read Cowboy Capitalism which documents the appallingly low living standards and inferior health care in western Europe. </p>
<p>A few years ago hundreds died in a heat wave in Paris because there was no air conditioning. In Europe only criminals can possess guns for the most part, Switzerland excepted. </p>
<p>Hate speech Stalinist laws are prevalent.</p>
<p>The socialized medical systems have a been total disaster and as in Canada people who can afford it come to the states for surgery and other serious medical conditions. </p>
<p>I know Bruce Bartlett, his expertise is on how FDR set up Pearl Harbor to get us in a war 80% of the American opposed. His knowledge of economics is nil.</p>
<p>The US is not a low tax country, only low if you compare it to the draconian tax rates of 90% from FDR to JFK&rsquo;s tax cuts which knocked it down to 70% and set off the boom of the 60s, which was killed by LBJ&rsquo;s war and Great Society unhelpful boondoggles.</p>
<p>The average worker is still paying close to a third in all taxes,<br>
social security-medicare, state &amp; local states, less in Fed now thanks to tax cuts or we would be paying 40%, that&rsquo;s the 75% of us who fortunate enough to have jobs or have to work multiple jobs.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate has been double the official stats because they factor in the military and factor out the people who have given up looking. Here in Oakland it&rsquo;s officially 17% but our local Democratic Assemblyman told me it is really 30%. In California as a whole the official lying stat is 12% but it is really 25%.</p>
<p>Under Carter it was at least 15-18% and under Obama it is at least 20%. Reagan inherited Carter&rsquo;s 18% inflation and 21% interest rates. After 1982 the Carter Depression ended and the tax cuts inspired boom began.</p>
<p>Carter not did not create 2,600,000 jobs every year but from 1978 to 1980 we lost jobs. Reagan created or rather his policies created many millions of jobs every year from 1983 on. </p>
<p>Clinton only slightly raised the top tax rates from 36% to 39% and cut the capital gains tax rate and eliminated welfare as a way of life, all Republican ideas opposed by most Democrats.</p>
<p>Furthermore the goal is to radically reduce government&rsquo;s take as taxes are simply pure theft. You are literally held up at the point of a gun. I vote against every bond issue here in Oakland and California. I rejoice in public sector layoffs. </p>
<p>I totally disagree with Laffer&rsquo;s reasoning because the whole purpose of tax cuts is for us to keep more of OUR money and less for government.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing the government does that couldn&rsquo;t be much better done privately and I include the police, courts and so-called &#8216;defense&rsquo; in that category. See For A New Liberty and Power &amp; Market by Rothbard.</p>
<p>The average person did not benefit under FDR, Truman, LBJ, Carter or Obama. They benefited from JFK and Clinton adopting more Republican policies. The only people who benefited from traditional Demo policies since Wilson are bureaucrats who couldn&rsquo;t make it on the free market.</p>
<p>Hoover started the New Deal, not FDR, who merely expanded it.</p>
<p>See America&rsquo;s Great Depression by Murray Rothbard. </p>
<p>FDR&rsquo;s domestic policies were such a gross failure that only his war preparations from 1939 on reduced unemployment. </p>
<p>Harding and Coolidge had successful economic policies. The 1920 Depression ended in a year because the Fed largely stayed out it in sharp contrast to the 1929-1939 Great Depression which lasted ten years precisely because of massive government intervention.</p>
<p>Obama is by far the worst President in US history and had the thinnest resume of any Presidential candidate ever. He only was elected because he is Black. Dumb whites largely put him in. </p>
<p>The kind of dummies who get their daily disinformation from The New York Times, the Pravda of the Hudson and The Washington Post, the Pravda of the Potomac as the Brazilian Ambassador to the US described it in the mid-60s.</p>
<p>If you vote to reelect Obama and more Democrats you will reap what you have sown.</p>

Is the U.S. Health Care System the &ldquo;Envy of the World&rdquo;? Not in Canada <br>
    <br>
An 82% to 8% majority of Canadians believe their system is superior to the U.S. system <br>
      <br>
ROCHESTER, N.Y. – August 12, 2009 – As members of Congress return to their states and districts to debate the merits of the Democrats&rsquo; proposals for health care reform, critics of the proposals may repeat the phrase used by some Republicans, newspaper editorials and bloggers that &lsquo;the American health care system is the envy of the world.&rdquo; <br>
     <br>
If so, they should read the results of a recent Harris/Decima poll in Canada that found a 10-to-1 majority of Canadians believed their system was &ldquo;superior&rdquo; to the U.S. system. They might also note that a 70% majority of Canadians thought their system was &ldquo;performing well&rdquo;; and that a majority favored an expansion of public sector health care (i.e., &ldquo;government-run&rdquo; health care in the current debate) over private sector health care.<br>

		<p>These political polls mean zero. I&rsquo;ve known many Canadians and they were all dissatisfied with the terrible socialist health care. <br>
For surgeries and serious medical Canadians as well as Europeans come here to the USA.<br>
As the old saying goes, 50 million Frenchmen can be wrong and often are.<br>
Your stats remind me of the old saw about lies and statistics.<br>
I respectfully suggest that you give it up and read the books that I recommended in my first post on this thread.<br>
While AmRen has a diverse philosophical readership I&rsquo;d bet good money that there are very few Socialists and LibDems here. <br>
Socialism and Central Planning have been an utter failure in every country and every continent where it has been tried.<br>
Your views would fit nicely on the In These Times, New Republic<br>
and Z Magazine sites except the last two require you to subscribe before you can comment.<br>
The ITT site is very fair about posting dissenting viewpoints as is AmRen. And you don&rsquo;t have to give them money.<br>
Finally, the Democratic Party is an anti-White male motley collection of statist special groups all yearning to feed at the public trough and force their laws down our throats.<br>
Your free to immigrate to a socialist and to keep voting Democrat<br>
but you are going to find fewer takers every year.<br>
You might to view the DVD Atlas Shrugged, Part 1. Takes place in the US in 2016. <br>

		<p>&#8220;When have tax cuts made the economy bloom?&#8221;</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had true tax cuts. There have been cuts in SOME tax rates. However, federal spending has continued to increase under conservatives and liberals. This spending is actually our true tax level since it  must ultimately be paid for by direct taxes, borrowing or creating more credit (ie. printing). This shows up as either higher taxes paid, higher inflation or higher interest rates. And this doesn&rsquo;t even consider that the increased spending supports MORE regulations which are a further drag on the economy.</p>
<p>Even Reagan boosted most of the taxes he supposedly cut. The best that can be said is that taxes have been deferred. </p>

		<p>Your figures for 1938 are wrong but they might be true for 1939 when the war preparations by FDR began to bear fruit. <br>
As I wrote before the actual unemployment figures are usually double the FedGov&rsquo;s self-interested announcements. <br>
Of course military spending is government spending and I am pleased that you recognize that fact which most of the Dumb Right doesn&rsquo;t.<br>
The ugly truth is that far more statism and collectivism in the US and UK took place after the war than during the New Deal.<br>
See John T. Flynn&rsquo;s The Roosevelt Myth and his later book As We Go Marching. The government controls in WW2 dwarfed the New Deal and that is why we need to elect Ron Paul for President.<br>
The other GOP candidates are WORSE than Obama on foreign policy and they are all Big Government &#8216;Conservatives&rsquo; but what they are trying to conserve is the Warfare-Welfare State (for some) <br>
going back to Hoover-Roosevelt.<br>
Again, many thanks to AmRen for providing this great free speech forum.<br>

		<p>None of your sources have the slightest credibility. I already explained what is wrong with The New York Times, the FBI Uniform Crime Reports and the official unemployment stats and have given contrary sources in book form to read.<br>
The Commerce Department has the same zero credibility that all other branches of FedGov have and that is also true of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.<br>
The War Street Journal is a lying neocon rag from which you very selectively quote, as shown by your comments on Reagan.<br>
You have in no way proven that my &#8220;assumptions&#8221; are false and a vague general quote from Charles Murray, whom I knew from my Objectivist days, will not do. I remember a long conversation with him in early 1964 when I finally got it through his head that the proposed 1964 Civil Rights Act was an evil violation of property rights.<br>
The word &#8216;scientific&rsquo; is way overused. Not everything can be approached with the methodology of physics. <br>
Opinions based on incorrect assumptions are not valid I agree and I suggest that applies to yours. <br>
The Establishment is starting to come apart and the day of uncritical acceptance is over. <br>

<p>      No, the medical care system we have now is not working well . Largely because of the greed of the medical industry and the insurance industry . I have a disabled child who is grown now and still living with us . His blood test at the hospital 268 bucks, at a private lab $35.00 . </p>
<p>     That was twenty years ago . Despite the good group policy we were under at the time, every time we had something major I was left owing significant amounts of money . I had to suffer harassment and make my family do without to pay those medical bills . Eventually they did get paid though . But if I had been a minority, it would have been another story . I had to pay for my other child&rsquo;s birth up front with borrowed money . No ifs, ands or buts&hellip;.. they had to have it then . We had a contract . During the child&rsquo;s birth another doctor happened to pass by and look in the door, bam  &mdash;    &mdash;  - another 400 bucks due . I went to the office to pay that, there was a minority in front of me . She was politely asked, &#8221; How much do you want to pay ?&#8221; &#8220;Ten dollars,&#8221; came the reply .</p>
<p>      Now on private insurance I have to pay totally outrageous premiums and in most cases our medical bills also . Basically what I have is what would have been considered catastrophic insurance a few years ago . Which you can no longer buy, big surprise huh ? Wonder why it is no longer available ? It used to be the cheap insurance . Now you have to pay a Cadillac premium so you can have cheap insurance that in most cases seems to do little good . Essentially I have to do this while my family lives in a doublewide so some insurance exec or hospital ceo can live in his four story brick home in an exclusive neighborhood . While we are on this subject let me be perfectly clear ; insurance is an industry that has no real overhead and doesn&rsquo;t produce a darn thing and yet the money just pours into their coffers every month sapping the American economy . We are at a crossroads in the this nation where we are in dire need of &#8220;real&#8221; industry, real jobs, real workers  &mdash;  - not high paid desk drivers who sit in their office all day with their finger up their derriere doing little of nothing  .</p>
<p>     We used to go to Florida quite a bit . We don&rsquo;t live far away . I&rsquo;ve run into a lot of Canadians and English . I&rsquo;ve yet to run into one who did not like their medical care system . I even had an Israeli major on one of my routes . What&rsquo;s an Israeli major doing in south Georgia ? US Army Vietnam, soldier of fortune, Israeli Army . They are all of one consensus, they couldn&rsquo;t otherwise afford it . Take it from someone who has paid for over thirty years, they are probably right, it&rsquo;s very expensive . </p>
<p>      All this aside, I cannot support the Obamacrats and Obamacare . I do believe he is now illegally in the White House . He attended a black nationalist church for over fifteen years, his wife has spoken and written things that sound very black nationalist . Why should we not suspect he may have black nationalist leanings ? </p>
<p>    Obamacare will ultimately become racial . They want to decide who will be cared for and who will not be and not on the basis of who has paid . Cynthia Tucker pinned a column not too long ago advocating pain pills and end of life counseling for the aged . She&rsquo;s no spring chicken herself, so obviously she has a game plan in place . We debated one of Leonard Pitt&rsquo;s columns a few years back, right here on Amren, where he made the statement, more or less saying;&#8221; This is not in keeping with the America we have planned etc.&#8221; All through the eighties and early nineties the debate was going on about revising history . This is a liberal thing . I have the author of &#8220;Jubilee&#8221; on tape saying,&#8221; This is why we must revise history.&#8221; I have a 1976 newspaper with a column by conservative pundit Jeffrey Hart where he is trying to warn us of the effort to rewrite history . The father of revisionist history, Howard Zinn, is a liberal . Albeit one who has paid his dues, he was on a B-17 crew during WW2 . I have  to tip my hat to him at least for that . I may condemn the war but I will not condemn the warrior . My point is, if you are conservative and suspect a conspiracy, suspect no longer it&rsquo;s real . And it has all but destroyed the America we remember and love . Being white in this nation will soon be a liability . </p>

In the first part of your comment you provide valid reasons, drawn from your own life, for supporting universal health care. In the concluding part you present right wing talking points to oppose it.<br>
 <br>
The only valid reason to oppose universal health care is that one is satisfied with one&rsquo;s private plan, and one does not want to pay for the over forty million Americans without health coverage. The great majority of these do not get health care at work. Their salaries are too small to afford it on their own.  <br>
 <br>
In no country with universal health care is there a popular demand to return to a privately financed system. In my comment #54 I demonstrated that the vast majority of Canadians are satisfied with their single payer health plan, and that a smaller majority want to expand it.  </p>

		<p>First, on the seven disparate items that he lists I only agree with the one on Eisenhower. See Operation Keelhaul by Julius Epstein and The Politician by Robert Welch on Ike&rsquo;s long, extensive pro-Communist background. Up to January 1952 Truman thought Ike was a left wing Democrat. Ike&rsquo;s record in postwar Germany implementing FDR&rsquo;s Communist-inspired Morgenthau Plan is documented in After The Reich by Giles MacDonough.</p>
<p>Ike protected numerous Communists while President at Columbia as did his brother Milton as President of John Hopkins.</p>
<p>Operation Keelhaul was the forced repatriation of millions of Russians who had fled Stalin&rsquo;s tyranny back to the USSR and sure death.</p>
<p>That Canadians are allegedly happy to steal from neighbors to for their own medical care is wrong and no slanted polls make it right. The reason to oppose socialized medicine is that one person&rsquo;s ability does not constitute a right to enslave him to satisfy another&rsquo;s need. There is no right to any goods or services produced by others. The idea of it constitutes slavery as Senator Rand Paul pointed out earlier this year and was condemned by the NAACP and other statist groups. I was once interviewed by the Gallup Poll and they definitely had an agenda, they kept coming back to certain issues and I could tell didn&rsquo;t like my answers.</p>
<p>The high cost of medicine is precisely because the government controls 60% of it now, get rid of all the government controls and it will go down dramatically. </p>
<p>Prescriptions per se are a big racket. Licensing is another. Government permissions to start hospitals and medical schools are another. The shallow liberal mind is impressed with credentialism but I know of several quacks who had all the right wastepapers.</p>
<p>Obama is continuing the disastrous neocon foreign policy and Bin Laden&rsquo;s assassination was part of the piece along Khaddafi&rsquo;s brutal murder, the grovelling to Israel, the drones in Pakistan, the war threats against Iran, GITMO still in place, military involvement in Africa now, the continuing attacks on individual rights in the name of 9-11 and so forth. </p>
<p>Obama is much more a Marxist at his deepest roots and his Communist connections are well documented in The Obama Nation and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The birther and Kenyan and Muslim charges are simply nonsense and distract from the real problem.</p>
<p>Holder is definitely a Black Racist. Obama was raised by leftist whites. I can&rsquo;t know his personal psyche.</p>
<p>Have no interest in the UFO flap.</p>
<p>Illuminati existed over 200 years but how is it an issue now ? </p>
<p>Newspapers, none, they are all establishment clones of the Times.</p>
<p>This site has more information than all the dailies in the country. AmRen knows how to interpret the lie media.</p>
<p>There are several great books I recommended to you and there are some great pro-laissez-faire capitalism sites. But why should I do your work for you ? </p>

		<p>I have been paying for the indigents for decades, I do it every time I go to the doctor and every time I make a medical insurance payment . I have to pay ten times what I should . They go and it may cost them a little pride but money wise it cost them little or nothing .</p>
<p>No I am not happy with the medical care system as it is or my medical insurance, in fact I am biting ten penny nails in two over it . The problem with the medical industry and the insurance industry is that they no longer have men of integrity running them . They are not concerned with what they may be putting American families through, they want their Gucci loafers, 500 dollar suits, a mansion in a gated neighborhood and a Mercedes SUV.  AIG took all of that taxpayer supplied bailout money and started handing themselves bonuses with it . Bonuses for what ? Mismanagement and misappropriation of funds ?  What I have been paying in medical insurance monthly would easily pay for a mansion . And then I have deductibles, co pays and exclusions to weather . How can I possibly be happy with that ? I would advocate endless audits and when someone is caught outside the law some extensive jail time wouldn&rsquo;t hurt for your insurance companies and the hospitals . </p>
<p>But even so&hellip; I prefer it to what Obamacare will ultimately be . I do not believe our proposed system will be like the Canadians or Europeans . It will be racially tinged and a system that will mete out death through indifference to those it doesn&rsquo;t like . Not to mention the fact it reads like it was written by the insurance industry . Jail time for no insurance ?  I think that comes under the heading of &#8220;captive clientele.&#8221;</p>
<p>My point about the minority pundits is that there is something going on here and they know it&rsquo;s going on . You have to try and read between the lines . Why on earth would a 56 year old columnist be advocating pain pills and end of life counseling for the aged ? In the twinkling of an eye she will be receiving those pain pills and end of life counseling . What did Pitts mean when he said,&#8221; The America we have planned ?&#8221; Just what is the America they have planned ? Is it possible we got a glimpse of it with Holder&rsquo;s indifference toward New Black Panthers threatening whites at the polls ? Or Holder&rsquo;s bungling of &#8220;Fast and Furious?&#8221; Maybe I should just remind myself while I am trying to protect my family with a 12 gauge single shot from third world drug armies sporting tax payer supplied assault rifles that the ATF and Justice Department meant well . </p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Pitts just shoot straight instead of codifying it ? Because he has something to hide . Obviously they all know something about the plan to revise history and whatever else, the rest of us don&rsquo;t . That in itself should begin to set off alarm bells for you, unless of course you happen to be a liberal and support it .  </p>
<p>Obama has something to hide . He doesn&rsquo;t produce an adequate birth certificate because it will implicate him in some manner. First we get a certificate of live birth, which is not the same thing . Then we are finally handed a facade of a birth certificate rife with inaccuracies . </p>

Do you seriously believe that if the government did nothing to help the poor with health care that your health bill would be ten percent of what it is? </p>

		<p>Yes, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure who Engelman was directing his rhetorical question AND most of the government&rsquo;s restrictions<br>
on medical care that I listed have nothing to do with helping the poor. <br>
The last thing we need is another central planning agency for medicine so it can be reduced to the level of The Fed or the Postal Service.</p>
