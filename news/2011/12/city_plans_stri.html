<h1>City Plans Strict Urban Beach Week Enforcement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Smiley, Miami Herald, December 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Six months after a deadly Memorial Day shooting sparked calls to end Miami Beach&rsquo;s annual holiday street parties, proposals to pacify both the crowds and the community are taking shape.</p>
<p>On one hand, city administrators are now saying local laws will be strictly enforced this May after several years of tolerating minor offenses such as public drinking.</p>
<p>On the other, business leaders  &mdash;  less than enthused with the idea of enduring the same raucous scenario every Memorial Day weekend  &mdash;  continue to court concert promoters to rebrand Urban Beach Week.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do nothing and something terrible happens, you&rsquo;ll have people standing in front of City Hall screaming for heads,&#8221; said Joshua Wallack, chief operating officer of Mangos Tropical Cafe. &#8220;We need to be proactive.&#8221;</p>
<p>An unofficial amalgamation of private club parties and street festivities, Urban Beach Week has drawn hundreds of thousands of tourists and day-trippers to South Beach every Memorial Day weekend since 2001.</p>
<p>The parties have been controversial since their inception, when the city was caught off guard and near riots broke out. While some businesses prosper unlike any other weekend, others shutter due to lack of sales or chaotic behavior. Many South Beach locals say they leave town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In response, the city plans to direct a massive Memorial Day weekend police force to end tolerance of &#8220;minor&#8221; offenses, such as possessing an open container in public.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for taking a zero tolerance position, the recent softer approach to enforcement began after the city was roundly criticized in 2006 by the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP following the arrests of more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some business owners can&rsquo;t live with the same event each year, regardless of enforcement tactics.</p>
<p>During Tuesday&rsquo;s Miami Beach Chamber of Commerce Board of Governor&rsquo;s meeting, Jason Starkman, owner of Jerry&rsquo;s Famous Deli, said he will not open his restaurant this Memorial Day Weekend unless something is done to drastically change an event that he says brought bat and knife-wielding patrons into his restaurant this year.</p>

With blacks, it&rsquo;s always damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If they enforce rules, blacks will complain they&rsquo;re being targeted. If they don&rsquo;t enforce the rules and it gets out of hand and blacks are hurt by their own revelry, blacks will complain that they city didn&rsquo;t do enough to protect them.</p>
<p>Either way, nothing good will come from this.</p>
<p>When it comes to blacks, you can&rsquo;t win.<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.  The &#8220;justice&#8221; department will send him a nice warning instructing him to stay open, or else, much like they did with the scores of businesses that closed down for &#8220;black bike week&#8221; in Myrtle Beach.  They don&rsquo;t care if lowly servers and cooks are put in danger, this is Black Run America.  You do what your told.  </p>
<p>Every black celebration ends with shootings and riot.  Imagine what&rsquo;s going to happen when the EBT cards stop working.   </p>

		<p>This is similar to what Atlanta officials did over a decade ago to stop the yearly &#8220;Freaknik&#8221; celebration of black college students who would block traffic, rape women and chase law abiding residents out of town for that weekend. They simply blocked off traffic and kept the crowds confined to the Atlanta University campus. The only event that remained after the end of Freaknik was a job fair.</p>

		<p>Rule # 1: blacks are not responsible for their actions.<br>
Rule # 2: any criticism of their actions is racist.<br>
Rule # 3: it&rsquo;s Whiteys fault they act like animals.</p>

		<p>My city used to allow drinking in public. Then a hip-hop nightclub opened downtown. The chaos, the huge street brawls, and open defiance of the police caused the city to reconsider its tolerant stance. Now drinking in public is prohibited. This is not the first time that my city strengthened nightlife rules in response to &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; behavior.</p>
<p>When developers, either public or private, create a community space (a plaza, a nightlife district, town square etc), they make rules with white people in mind. Developers and city leaders consider security requirements, drinking rules, closing times, number of liquor licenses, outdoor music volume, etc while assuming a largely white clientele. </p>
<p>Cities are routinely caught off-guard when the hip-hop community joins the fun. Suddenly, a generally peaceful party spot becomes a violent nightmare. New rules are imposed, and the &#8220;party zone&#8221; slowly disintegrates. Instead of being brave and addressing the real problem, the cities decide to end the party. We are governed by cowards.</p>

		<p>I lived in Miami 2004-2009 and there is no way to put this politely, Urban Crime Week is an utter disgrace. I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe how stores and restaurants not only close their doors, but &#8220;shutter&#8221; their windows and entrances for the weekend. I think this whole thing blew wide open last May when a famous gay rights activist and Miami Beach resident spoke up, condemning the beach goers&rsquo; behavior. Vulgarity, obscenity, stink, dirt, jaw dropping behavior pretty much sums up what you will see. The streets are littered with garbage every morning for an entire week.</p>
<p>I had the unfortunate displeasure of trying to host family on South Beach as they unknowingly came for Urban Crime Week in 2005&hellip;</p>

		<p>Oh, now the ACLU and NAACP are in the business of forcing cities to give parties! Next they will be demanding that raves be increased and they&rsquo;ll demand that the police let the raves occur without interruption.</p>

		<p>I lived in S Fl from the 50s-80s and saw a paradise fall into the abyss.  Miami Beach was and still is dominated by the Jewish community that lives there.  During the 50s and most of the 60s, Miami Beach was a well odered place, low crime and no &#8220;urban parties&#8221;.  As a matter of fact, for all of the 50s and into the 60s, blacks had to have a work permit to be on the island, particularly after dark.  Well, as the local population become increasingly more liberal politically, it was decided to reform their, ahem, feelings towards others. This was the beginning of the end to a placid Miami Beach. The socialists decided that it was necessary to build &#8220;affordable&#8221; housing, a suicide pill if there ever was one, next there was officially sanctioned activities to draw a &#8220;diverse&#8221; crowd. Well, since that time I haven&rsquo;t been back to Miami Beach, too crowded with people that I don&rsquo;t want my family to occupy the same space. Now this so-called urban party is just an extension of the liberal necessity to cater to those that despise our civilization. Does this remind anyone of the similar &#8220;urban events&#8221; in Virginia Beach, Daytona Beach, Atlanta, etc.? If visiting Florida remember, there are many other places besides the crime-ridden Miami area to visit. For beach destinations there are lovely, safe barrier islands from SW Fl all the way up the Gulf to NW Fl. Oh, only one drawback, there are no urban parties along the Gulf coast.</p>

<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s the problem with Urban Beach Weekend   &mdash;   Too many people running around with open containers.  The violent crimes and the mayhem?  They might as well not even exist, according to the tone of this article.</p>

		<p>Here in Rochester, NY the Lake Ontario beach was shut down on Memorial Day because of mass gang fights.  I&rsquo;ve never seen so many policemen in one area.  The Rochester PD is like a small army!  The policemen were usually very polite, though.</p>
<p>To poster Anonymous #4, well-put.</p>
<p>Alcohol and drugs are only part of the problem.  High concentration of blacks is a very big problem, but you&rsquo;re not allowed to acknowledge it.</p>

		<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have here in the United States a Black problem, and ignoring it won&rsquo;t make it go away.  We must be sure to point it out at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Why is there a security guard at this restaurant?  Black people.</p>
<p>Why do you lock your car door when you drive through certain areas?  Black people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s late, but maybe it&rsquo;s not too late.  Be courageous with your speech, and do not censor the truth in the name of political correctness.  Call it like you see it.  Speak from the convictions of your experience.  They are not like us, and they destroy everything they touch.</p>

		<p>What city officials should do is ban these urban parties altogether as hazards to public safety, and where there are mass gatherings of people, station armed police and national guardsmen to maintain order. It&rsquo;s that, or citizens will have to use their weapons to defend their homes, businesses and loved ones from these mahogany mobs whos activities are aided, abetted and enabled by the likes of the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center, whose architects are anti-white activists bent on creating social chaos and genocidal violence against white Americans.</p>

		<p>I have a crazy hunch, but maybe  &mdash;  just maybe  &mdash;  the way blacks act today was a reason we had segregation and &#8216;fears of blacks&rsquo;?  I have a feeling had MLK lived, the majority of whites then would have seen what a farce the whole CRM was and the 1964 laws would have been repealed quickly, we&rsquo;d have closed borders, white women would prefer having kids over careers, most white women would have kids with white men, most white men wouldn&rsquo;t chase Asian women, we&rsquo;d have a stronger country, we&rsquo;d be a stronger race of people, our men wouldn&rsquo;t be feminized, our young men would choose to be responsible strong men over whimps or gangsters, etc.  Hell, even blacks would have been better off.  Having no welfare or laws against whites or laws favoring blacks, they&rsquo;d mind their Ps and Qs more, and they wouldn&rsquo;t be (at least openly) bashing whitey.  Maybe&hellip;</p>

		<p>The only people who could have influence here are the gays.  They&rsquo;re a powerful group, generally have good incomes, and are another protected class of people.  Politicians listen to them.</p>

		<p>There was NEVER a time (when I was growing up) (1950s 1960s) where blacks were NOT a &#8220;problem&#8221;.  In the Catholic schools of the time, &#8220;civil rights&#8221; workers would be brought in to &#8220;indoctrinate&#8221; the students. The sob stories of the poor disenfranchised blacks would be paraded out; we were supposed to feel sorry for them  &mdash;  NOT THIS KID.   Life in Detroit was way different.  Blacks were feared because they were criminals  &mdash;  their whole culture was not based on American principles, but &#8220;rule of the jungle&#8221;.</p>
<p>The one thing for a white kid to fear was being approached by two blacks on one bike.  One would jump off and steal your bike. Any resistance was met by a severe beating from BOTH of them.   Going to the black &#8220;kid&rsquo;s&#8221; house was an exercise in futility, even for white parents.  They would DARE you to take back your own property.  Their parents would be laughing at the stupid whites for &#8220;allowing&#8221; their bike to be taken.  The police were no use even back then &hellip;</p>
<p>To this day, I have NO USE for the people that were brought here.  Despite being brought here and having their circumstances improved, they have NEVER been able to assimilate.<br>
