				Stabbed Teacher Claims Assault Was to Kill Her

				<i>Poughkeepsie Journal, December 17, 2011</i>
			</p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
			<p>
				Cynthia Glozier, the Poughkeepsie High School teacher stabbed Thursday, said today through her attorney that the fellow English teacher who assaulted her was trying to kill her.
			</p>
			<p>
				The teacher charged with the assault, Ronette Ricketts, is out of jail after someone posted her bail Friday.
			</p>
			<p>
				Glozier remains in good condition at Saint Francis Hospital. Her attorney, Tom O&rsquo;Neill said she was &#8220;extremely traumatized&#8221; by the attack.
			</p>
			<p>
				His client, he said this afternoon, wanted to make clear that the stabbing incident was not the outcome of a fight.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;It was absolutely not a fight,&#8221; O&rsquo;Neill said. &#8220;It was a vicious, unproved, premeditated attempt to kill her.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Fortunately, he said, an administrator and one or two students in the high school hallway intervened to stop the attack.
			</p>
			<p>

				As things return to normal in the Poughkeepsie High School community, new details are emerging in the case of a veteran English teacher who allegedly repeatedly stabbed a colleague with a screwdriver.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Ricketts, 40 from the Town of Poughkeepsie, is charged with first-degree attempted assault and second-degree assault, felonies, and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon, a misdemeanor.
			</p>
			<p>
				English teacher Cynthia Glozier, 54, of Rhinebeck, remained hospitalized Friday. Her condition was upgraded from stable to good on Friday, according to Saint Francis Hospital. She was stabbed 16 times in the face, back and upper torso, according to city police.

					Meanwhile, he press has gone out of its way NOT to show a picture of, or mention the race of Andre Turner, who killed two people and shot two others at his workplace ion Southern California over the weekend. Of course, the names and photos of the victims indicate they are either white or Hispanic.

					Eerie, because even before this news item, I was looking up Pougkeepsie online, because of upper New York&rsquo;s prominence in Washington Irving&rsquo;s stories. Thinking I might like to explore New York from Albany to the Catskills, I Googled &#8220;Poughkeepsie&#8221; and wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, they are demographically challenged.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;The racial makeup of the city was 52.8% White, 35.7% Black or African American-&#8220;
				</p>
				<p>
					That was the showstopper. Whenever blacks exceed their allotted 13% reflected in the national demographics, no good can come from it. Conversely, the further their numbers dip in a given city below 13%, the more enriching and peaceful one seems to find their vacation.

					Another affirmative action teacher to whom the unwary public are supposed to entrust their children to. Not exactly a confidence builder. I wonder what lessons the students there have drawn from this.

					This happened about an hour drive south of me. I wonder how long it will take the school to fire Ms Ricketts? A White teacher that went berserk and assaulted another faculty member would be fired immediately. In the case of Ricketts, no mention of disciplinary action on the part of the school yet. Maybe they&rsquo;re awaiting the outcome of her trial? Whites are held to much higher standards. An vicious attack by a White is a sign of moral failings, while a similar crime by a favored minority is viewed as some kind of legacy of slavery or other social explanation.

					It seems that white americans or whites anywhere, have to learn the truth one at a time. This is the legacy of liberalism that leaves so many whites unprepared for the stark reality of blacks. They are not like whites, they are very very different in how they think and what they think and how they react.

					According to the article about 50 people showed up in court to &#8220;support&#8221; the screwdriver attacker. I wonder what color they were? This shows the base level of ignorance of blacks.
				</p>
				<p>
					This deranged &#8220;teacher&#8221; is a microcosm of what has become of public education now that the system has been flooded with incompetent, affirmative action blacks.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is another example of why home school/private school is the best approach.

					You can bet before all this is said and done concerning this case, this black &#8220;teacher&#8221; will be accusing the white teacher of &#8220;racism&#8221; as a way to justify this attack and put the white teacher on the defensive.

					Only a reality-challenged liberal or a morally-challenged lawyer could argue this wasn&rsquo;t attempted murder. That &#8220;assertion&#8221; shouldn&rsquo;t even be open to debate. There&rsquo;s nothing legitimately subjective about being stabbed 16 times.

					This sounds like a clear case of attempted murder to me! Clearly, the charges do not reflect the vicious, unprovoked nature of this attack, in which the victim was stabbed 16 times in the face and upper torso area by this animal! What was bail set at I wonder?
				</p>
				<p>
					Is it because the attacker is black and victim is white?<br />

					Thank heavens that photo of the assailant is labeled, one look at those shoulders my first thought was that Michelle had changed her hairdo. The reason for the assault - any one want to take bets on it - the other teacher used nasty racial slurs.

					An immediate charge of attempt murder and assault with a deadly weapon is mandatory for this case. She also should have been held without bond because she screeched that she was &#8220;going to get her&#8221; as she was being lead out, according to the previous report on this case. It was even mentioned that there was bad blood between these two teachers, which indicates a high likelihood that she will attempt to finish the job now that she is out on bail. Truly a case of another savage black criminal being coddled by the PC courts. Lynchmons need to return.

					looks like cynthia glozier is reaping the benefits of diversity, you know, as a teacher she has probably promoted those benefits for the last 25 years. diversity is our strength, diversity makes us richer, and better. well live with it cynthia, you and all of your fellow educators have caused it.

					*About 50 people attended the 10-minute proceeding Friday and many were there to support Ricketts,
				</p>
				<p>
					Yeah, I&rsquo;m curious what that crowd of &#8220;supporters&#8221; looked like. My guess is that it was mainly black with a good dose of &#8220;it wasn&rsquo;t about race&#8221; clueless Whites. What kind of mindset would one have to have to show up to SUPPORT a person that tried to KILL someone? I wonder how many blacks would show up to support a White teacher that tried to kill a black coworker?

					I talked about this to a friend of mine who is a retired teacher. She says the assailant will be backed 100% by the teacher&rsquo;s union, and will most likely be allowed to continue teaching in this school. What will the children learn from this vicious, feral excuse for a teacher? I can remember a time when teachers were supposed to be examples of behavior for the students to look up to and respect&hellip;

					How&rsquo;s this homicidal loony out on bail? From the account provided, she clearly intended to kill her victim.
				</p>
				<p>
					Had she been the victim and the white woman the attacker, the crime would have made national news and the attacker would be in jail with perhaps $2 million bail required.

					According to local news reports, Ms.Glozier was the main teacher (part of a group of teachers) that were trying to get the administration to revoke Ms. Rickets status as a tenured teacher. She is apparently a very popular teacher in the school among the students.

					But in our wonderful diverse society it is doubtful a black jury would find this to be attempted murder. Blacks always claim it was just a &#8220;fight&#8221;, remember the Jenna 6 where a gang of blacks were stomping on the head of an already unconscious white student and were indignant to have to even face assault charges&hellip;

				<p>
					&ldquo;She thought she was being terminated from her employment as a teacher,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what would have given this teacher the impression that she was being terminated. There was no issue with her concerning adverse personnel actions.&rdquo;

					Justin Richardson was walking through the hallways of Poughkeepsie High School on his way to his fourth-period class Thursday when he saw what he thought was a fight.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the 18-year-old senior approached, the scene came into clearer focus.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;I saw Ms. Ricketts hitting Ms. Glozier in the back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I saw she had a screwdriver in her hand.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Richardson said Cynthia Glozier was crying for help.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;She was yelling, &lsquo;Help me, help me, get her off of me,&rsquo; &rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The way she was screaming &lsquo;help me,&rsquo; it was horrifying.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					&hellip;
				</p>
				<p>
					Richardson had just come from his earth science class when he saw the two women in the hallway.
				</p>
				<p>
					For Richardson, a linebacker for the Poughkeepsie Pioneers high school football team and about 6 feet tall and about 210 pounds, it was enough for him to stand in the way to slow down Ricketts.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;I put my hands in between them and separated them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I put my arm against her (Ricketts) and gave her a decent shove and pushed her into the corner.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Another teacher, David Laffin, was already there, trying to pull Glozier away from Ricketts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Glozier, Richardson said, &ldquo;seemed really, really, really scared &mdash; scared for her life. She was bleeding from the side of her head and from her neck.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					He recalled the look in Ricketts&rsquo;s eyes as she jabbed at Glozier with the screwdriver.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;I looked into her eyes, and I saw rage,&rdquo; Richardson said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Ms. Ricketts, whoever she was.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Richardson said he went for Ricketts&rsquo; hand.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;I tried to knock the screwdriver away from her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It flew out of her hand.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					A school security guard arrived moments after Richardson and helped subdue Ricketts, he said.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;After I broke it up, the security guard took over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just walked away.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Angry, disappointed
				</p>
				<p>
					Several days after the incident, Richardson said he felt conflicted about what happened.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t how to feel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m angry, I guess.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Angry with the school, he said, and &ldquo;very disappointed&rdquo; in Ricketts.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;The simple fact that our teachers and our administration preach to us, the senior class, about being role models and having a positive attitude,&rdquo; he said.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really disturbing. They&rsquo;re supposed to be our role models,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;But I was the one who had to step in and be a role model.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					He described Ricketts as having been a friend.

					After having a falling-out with Ricketts in 10th grade, Richardson said, he stopped speaking to her for about a year.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;We started talking again in 12th grade,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We became friends. We bonded. I&rsquo;m very disappointed in her.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Richardson expressed further disappointment with the 20 or so people, including two or three adult school staffers, he said, who stood around and watched the attack without trying to stop it.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;There were a lot of people there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They just stood around and watched the whole time.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Richardson said he wanted to know why Ricketts did what she did.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;She was obviously angry about something,&rdquo; he said.<br />
					Act of courage
				</p>
				<p>
					Days after the incident, Ken Barger, a seven-year football coach and special-education teacher, said he was extremely proud of Richardson.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;It was a stress situation,&rdquo; Barger said. &ldquo;He knew what had to be done, and he reacted. He put himself in harm&rsquo;s way to save somebody else. It was an amazing act of courage.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Barger, who met with Richardson a few hours after the stabbing, described him as &ldquo;calm, cool and collected,&rdquo; adding that Richardson still had a lot of adrenaline in his system at the time. &ldquo;It was just sinking in.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Barger said he recognized some of the skills Richardson had been taught on the team in the actions he took in the hallway of the school that day.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a validation of all the life skills we teach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We try to prepare them for situations that arise that are unexpected. They could be stressful and overwhelming experiences. But you have to prepare em for all possibilities.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Barger said Richardson was being called a hero.
				</p>
				<p>
					&ldquo;The definition of a hero is an ordinary person who when the time arises steps in and makes a difference,&rdquo; Barger said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he did.&rdquo;

					Sorry, but for the life of me I cannot imagine a black person teaching English. Even by the watered-down, low standards of education majors and the feel-goodery of American schools these days I simply don&rsquo;t believe that a black person can speak English properly both in terms of accent and grammar or have a real, active academic interest in literature and the language. In fact, the more I think about it, I&rsquo;m not sure I would find a black teacher credible in any subject taught to students beyond the age of about eight.

					Something else that caught my attention - why did Ricketts have a screwdriver? How many of you have fond memories of your female teachers carrying a SCREWDRIVER around? This was obviously premeditated, not just a sudden outburst out of nowhere. Others here have said that Ms. Glozier was probably a liberal, but that might not be the case. She might have been one of &#8220;us&#8221; and was the only one brave enough to call it like it was with Ms. Ricketts, thereby making Ms. Ricketts think that Ms. Glozier was a &#8220;racisss&#8221; that needed to be taught a lesson. How many times have blacks gone to their workplaces and shot up a bunch of &#8220;Whate racisss&#8221;? Think about it!

					We just had a black on white double murder here in Indianapolis that was more senseless than usual. Two blacks are accused of murdering a 21 year old man and his 7 year old niece. It is implied in the local fishwrap (aka &#8220;The Indianapolis Star&#8221;) that they did this to steal an Xbox and a play station to trade for drugs. One of the accused went to high school with the 21 y.o. victim and spent a lot of time at his house. So much so that the niece referred to him as &#8220;Uncle Mike&#8221;. Let no good deed go unpunished. (Go to yahoo or google and look up Kyleigh Crane and Jeremy Crane; these are the victims.)

					When I worked in a 90 percent black clerical department at UCLA hospital, one of the most highly regarded hospitals in the country, every one of the black men in the department was a criminal. Some went to state prison, some just county jail,but they were one and all criminals. So were many of the women. I think all the women were welfare to work employees.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a few years of total disfunction the hospital decided to go with a private contractor who hired nothing by civilized, competent hispanics. No Whites of course, but at least no black felons prowling the halls and parking lots.

					That&rsquo;s what gets me when anti White racists expound on the wonderful middle class affirmative action civil service blacks. I know what they are, just average blacks, criminals and thugs.

					Just one good thing about it. This is a workmen&rsquo;s comp injury. By law, the injured parties medical insurance does not cover workplace injuries.

				<p>
					So the school district that hired the feral savage will have to pay for her medical care and even better, the continuing medical care rising from the attack for the rest of her life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Their workmen&rsquo;s comp insurance rates will go sky high. Their insurer might even drop the district because of this outrage and they will have a hard time finding another insurance company.
				</p>
				<p>
					Good!!!
				</p>
				<p>
					If there is even one black on the jury the savage might very well get off. Because of affirmative action she might get her job back or get a job with another school district. The victim will of course be accused of using the n word.

					Blacks are dangerous in the neighborhood, out and about in public, in hospitals, at public events, in movie theaters and the workplace. They are a menace.

					There are some black teachers who read at about a third grade level. They try to hide it but often can&rsquo;t. Poor baby, she was in over her head. Had she attacked a White male student the liberals would claim he was a skinhead White supremacist. They would research his life and family history until they found that back in the 1950&rsquo;s his grandfather was in the army with a southerner who &#8220;may have had ties to the K.&#8221;

					I fear that the average white just isn&rsquo;t smart enough. We may be the smartest or nearly the smartest race on earth but that isn&rsquo;t enough. When we are presented with evidence that leads to uncomfortable conclusions, we deny the truth. Religion is a good example of this head in the sand thinking. If whites can&rsquo;t see the farce of supreme beings, how can we expect them to suss out the truth about race inequality.

					Attempted assault? When, after having inflicted 16 stab wounds on a person&rsquo;s neck face and torso (thereby endangering the eyes, carotid, jugular vein and heart )with a screwdriver, does the &#8220;assault&#8221; begin? Is there a minimum requirement of let&rsquo;s say 25 stab wounds before it can be called an actual assault? May we infer that if Ms. Glozier had bled out and died from a bisected carotid or a punctured heart in that school corridor, would the charge then be upgraded to &#8220;attempted murder&#8221;? Could we also speculate that if no one had intervened that Ricketts would have continued until the victim expired? Ergo Eve Carson, Channon and Christopher, Lauren Burk and Amy Willard are not really dead but merely victims of &#8220;attempted&#8221; rape and murder?<br />

					Defense attorney Greenwald described his client as a &ldquo;much-loved&rdquo; teacher and the product of a &ldquo;nice, middle-class Jamaican family.
				</p>
				<p>
					Greenwald, why am I not surprised. Wonder if he is an ADL ACLU AJC SPLC NAACP employee and one or more of those organizations are doing a pro bono defense of the attacker.
				</p>
				<p>
					A single Mother being fired after 17 years on the job is under a lot of stress. I hate to say it, but a mental illness, stress, irrestible impulse defense has a lot of validity. Just one black or female White liberal on the jury and she might get off.
				</p>
				<p>
					ADL ACLU AJC SPLC NAACP have billions of tax exempt dollars and federal grants with which to wage their race war against Whites.
				</p>
				<p>
					The defense will have an endless supply of the best psychiatrists in the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					She might just get off with a 2 month evaluation period in a mental hospital. Then she will be pronounced cured and go back to teaching at the same school.
				</p>
				<p>
					Happens all the time.

					&#8220;If you google around for follow-up stories about the school board meetings, etc, there is a shocking number of comments by parents and board members showing sympathy FOR THE ATTACKER, hoping that she gets &ldquo;proper counseling, etc&rdquo;&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the load of defense psychiatrists who will testify for her, these anti White racists will testify as character witnesses for the defendant and derogatory witnesses for the victim.
				</p>
				<p>
					With all the liberal anti White money behind Greenwald the savage is sure to get off with probation and counseling.

					I wonder if she sharpened the screw driver? That makes a difference when proving intent. Defense will say she just happened to have a screwdriver in her purse and the sight of that evil racist White woman caused an irrestible impulse to stab out in an attempt to assert her right as a proud black woman to keep a job at which she is totally incompentent and was not qualified for in the first place.

					Justin Richardson DOES deserve praise for stopping the attack. Maybe he can serve as a role model for the black community since Ronette obviously cannot.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most disturbing thing is that Ronette was out on bond by the next day while Glozier spends an extended amount of time in the hospital. And that a large mob appears in support of Ronette despite the viciousness of the attack. Kind of like how Obama got elected.

					Berhardt Goetz had four brothas around him on the Subway, and all were carrying sharpened screwdrivers, after a long day of emptying Arcade video games.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately for the brothas, Bernie was carrying a concealed S&W; .38 which he promptly pulled and used on his attackers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then he disappeared off the train and into the crowd, which was running the other way.
				</p>
				<p>
					What happened as a result of this shooting of four Subway slugs? Crime dropped 90% as the Thugs now knew there was a potential in getting shot and killed if they assaulted another unknown, but easy looking, target on the Subway.

					I&rsquo;m glad he intervened. And I&rsquo;m glad that this school finally got a good return for all the money it has spent on its football program over all these years.

					We all know the power of language now because when some black person attacks a white person, and the press calls it a &#8220;fight&#8221;, then, presto-chango, no charges get filed against the black psychopath. Our government is complicit in facilitating a race war against white people.

					That is a link to the yahoo article that up-plays the attack so as to help boost the black student who intervened in the attack to show &#8220;how noble&#8221; he was. As if to help obfuscate the obvious racial tone of this attack and the seriousness of it. This only results in the attacker basically being slapped on the wrist instead of being charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. If the races were reversed, you know darn well that the White teacher would not only have both of those charges but also be found guilty of a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;.

					Cynthia Glozier, 54, of Rhinebeck etc etc etc, Notice NO use of &#8220;Ms&#8221; and where is her concerned worried &#8220;husband&#8221; ? Me thinks if the perp (40 yr old single mom) stabbed her thinking that she was about LOSE her job in the toughest recession since the 30&rsquo;s she must&rsquo;ve been very very worried about the possibility of her on the breadline with a son with NO dad etc, My theory is that Cynthia Glozier with NO husband &amp; kids(at her bedside)may have wanted a SEXUAL relationship with the exotic Jamaican female teacher and may have issued threats towards her its not the first time something like this has happened and it will happen again its human nature.
