	                	<p>When 6-year-old Ryon Smith wasn&rsquo;t locked in his mother&rsquo;s closet inside her Cahokia home, he was being beaten by her live-in boyfriend, prosecutors told a jury today.</p>
<p>Ryon was found dead with bruises and abrasions covering his body on Christmas Day 2005, they said, opening their first-degree murder case in St. Clair County Circuit Court here against that boyfriend, Lee Crutchfield.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Crutchfield described how Ryon was a difficult child who often hurled racial insults at him. Crutchfield is black, the boy&rsquo;s mother is white.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t stand to be around a child that is disrespectful,&#8221; Crutchfield told police.</p>
<p>He alleged that the boy would fake seizures and urinate all over the house. The boy was given a diaper and often locked in a closet, police said.</p>
<p>Crutchfield said he punched Ryon twice in the head because the boy was biting his finger about two days before he was found dead.</p>
<p>Ryon died from blunt force trauma, prosecutors said. {snip}</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s mother, Starr Lohman, also is charged with first-degree murder but is reported to have reached an agreement for a reduced charge in return for testifying against Crutchfield.</p>
