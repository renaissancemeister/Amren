				Murder Defendant Told Police He Punched Child Who Died in Cahokia
			</h1>
			<p>
				Nicholas J.C. Pistor, STL Today, November 29, 2011
			</p>
			<div class="lead">
				Said 6 year old shouted racial insults at him.
			</div>
			
				<p>
					When 6-year-old Ryon Smith wasn&rsquo;t locked in his mother&rsquo;s closet inside her Cahokia home, he was being beaten by her live-in boyfriend, prosecutors told a jury today.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ryon was found dead with bruises and abrasions covering his body on Christmas Day 2005, they said, opening their first-degree murder case in St. Clair County Circuit Court here against that boyfriend, Lee Crutchfield.
				</p>
				<p>
					{snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					Crutchfield described how Ryon was a difficult child who often hurled racial insults at him. Crutchfield is black, the boy&rsquo;s mother is white.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;I can&rsquo;t stand to be around a child that is disrespectful,&#8221; Crutchfield told police.
				</p>
				<p>
					He alleged that the boy would fake seizures and urinate all over the house. The boy was given a diaper and often locked in a closet, police said.
				</p>
				<p>
					Crutchfield said he punched Ryon twice in the head because the boy was biting his finger about two days before he was found dead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ryon died from blunt force trauma, prosecutors said. {snip}
				</p>
				<p>
					The boy&rsquo;s mother, Starr Lohman, also is charged with first-degree murder but is reported to have reached an agreement for a reduced charge in return for testifying against Crutchfield.
