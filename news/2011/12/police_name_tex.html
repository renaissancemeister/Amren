<h1>
				Police Name Texas Christmas Shooting Suspect

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
			<p>
				Dressed in a Santa suit, Aziz Yazdanapah showed up at his estranged wife&rsquo;s home near Dallas during a Christmas celebration with her sister&rsquo;s family, and killed everyone before turning the gun on himself, police believe.
			</p>
			<p>
				The seven bodies were discovered strewn in the living room area of the Grapevine apartment, amid opened presents and near a Christmas tree.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Suspected shooter Aziz Yazdanpanah, 58, had been estranged from his wife and two teenage children when they moved out of the family&rsquo;s upscale home in nearby Colleyville earlier this year.
			</p>
			<p>
				His wife, Fatemeh Rahmati, 56, who was a licensed manicurist at a local salon, as well as their daughter, Nona Yazdanpanah, 19, and their son, Ali Yazdanpanah, 14, were also killed.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the other family, who were visiting Rahmati&rsquo;s apartment on Christmas morning, were her sister, Zohreh Rahmaty, 58, Hossein Zarei, 59, and daughter Sahra Zarei, 22.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Yazdanpanah&rsquo;s family, Iranian immigrants who had settled in the Dallas-Fort Worth area decades ago, had been fighting foreclosure and had declared bankruptcy on their home, a 3,000-square foot house built in 1990 and recently valued near $350,000, according to public records.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				He was a friendly man who loved his children, neighbors said.

			</p>
			<p>
				<br />
				Aziz Yazdanpanah seemed to be losing control of his life in recent months  &mdash;  his wife left him, his house was in foreclosure, and his 19-year-old daughter was dating a young man he didn&rsquo;t like.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even so, the 58-year-old former real estate agent from Colleyville seemed to be holding it together. Neighbors say he would smile and wave as he drove through his middle-class neighborhood. Recently, he was seen raking leaves in his yard.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				Grapevine police also searched the Colleyville home where Aziz Yazdanpanah had been living since he separated from his wife last spring. Public records show that the couple had filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and that the property was in foreclosure &hellip; .
			</p>
			<p>
				Yazdanpanah said he bought a gun after expressing concern that his daughter&rsquo;s boyfriend was stalking him. He also insisted on picking up his daughter from her job at a phone kiosk inside Sam&rsquo;s Club in Grapevine because of concerns about the alleged stalker.
			</p>
			<p>
				The boyfriend has not been publicly identified.
			</p>
			<p>
				Neighbors said the family was Muslim but had always hung Christmas lights on their home  &mdash;  except this year.
			</p>
			<p>
				{snip}
			</p>
			<p>
				But a more ominous portrait emerged of Yazdanpanah in interviews with some of his daughter&rsquo;s other classmates.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;She would come to school crying and telling us her dad was crazy,&#8221; said Lacie Reed, 18. &#8220;He wouldn&rsquo;t let her wear certain things. He was always taking her phone away, checking her call history and checking her text messages.&#8221;
			</p>
			<p>
				Friends said Nona&rsquo;s father had installed cameras all around the home so he could watch the family&rsquo;s comings and goings. Others said he nailed her bedroom window shut so she could not sneak out at night and see her boyfriend.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;She couldn&rsquo;t date at all until she was a certain age, but when he was going to let her date she couldn&rsquo;t date anyone outside of their race or religion,&#8221; Reed said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yiselle Alvarenga, 18, said Nona&rsquo;s mother and brother seemed to come to her aid when her father punished her.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#8220;He would take her phone away and her mother would give it back to her and her brother would let her use his phone,&#8221; Alvarenga said. &#8220;She was doing good. She was just excited that her life was going to start and she was going to have control of it.&#8221;

					Religious piety is last refuge of the scoundrel who has failed at life. That goes double for Muslims. As an ethnic group, Persians normally are a cut or two above the Arabs. Yet both become equally bad when afflicted with fundamentalist Islam and its attendant sense of &#8220;honor.&#8221; Dressing up as Santa apparently isn&rsquo;t a cure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Say a prayer, if you will, for the innocent murdered family members.

					Dollars to donuts, the police will not categorize this as an honor killing. Amina and Sarah Said were both killed by their father because they were not acting Muslim enough. They had boyfriends in high school and realy liked the &#8216;kafir&rsquo; ways. Their loving father was dishonored, drove them to Irving in a borrowed taxi and shot them dead. He is still at large. I will bet the local police will not call this an honor killing either.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unless we want to live with this kind of activity forever, we best rid ourselves of Islam in America.

					Talked breifly about this out at dinner tonight with a friend. Told him I didn&rsquo;t care as long as it was Muslim on Muslim. He said he didn&rsquo;t like that kind of behavior in this country. Told him that Islam was incompatible with our way of life. He scrunged up his face and said &#8220;well, not that kind of Muslim&#8221;. I said none of them should be allowed in.

					Since this crime was first reported, there has been little information released.
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally, we are shown images of grieving family and friends. The news coverage only showed white neighbors which made me suspicious.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now I know why the media was interviewing white neighbors and there was little information being released.<br />

					I had wondered why, after the intial report, that this story seemed to drop off the radar screen. Obviously, the media is up to its usual trickes here - when non-Whites are the perps, these mass-killings NEVER get the type of hysterical coverage they do should the attacker be, or even appear to be White.

					Cults aren&rsquo;t protected under freedom of religion as far as I&rsquo;m aware, regardless of how many adherents said cult has.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or bizarre.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					So, how many here believe honor killings are abnormal?

					Weird story. They were Muslim but celebrated Christmas? Family lived here for decades? Most likely got out of Iran when the Mullahs took over I suppose. According to the neighbors they were Muslim, but most people in the US think everyone from the mideast is Muslim, so there&rsquo;s really no telling. It could be more of a cultural thing than a religious thing. Pretty terrible. I hate reading about stories like this at Christmas.

					Let&rsquo;s not pin this on Muslims or Iranians as there are more than enough examples of American white men killing their wives and children. A lot of Iranians have done well in America and I think, in general, as &#8220;Seek&#8221; wrote they are a cut above. This guy had been successful and stable for many years before the ultimate breakdown. As far as troubles with his daughters, I&rsquo;m positive that many white American dads have experienced similiar concerns and frustrations with adolescent daughters wanting to date outside thier class or race. Obviously, the overwhelming majority do not go out and kill thier families but this is not a Muslim problem though the press might have been overly cautious in publicizing the identities of all involved.

					When this story was first reported they went to great lengths to avoid giving any real information about what happened. On that basis, I knew it involved non-whites and/or non-Christians. Had they been white folks like me, their faces would have been plastered all over the front page.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surely I&rsquo;m not the only person who came to that pretty obvious conclusion.

					This story was handled oddly by the media (and perhaps the authorities) from the outset. And then, when the identity of the murderer was revealed, news items containing praises of him sprouted up overnight. He was &#8220;very nice,&#8221; a &#8220;very good neighbor,&#8221; etc. This journalistic trend of praising murderers immediately following their crimes is of recent vintage, and it&rsquo;s used only selectively.

					I knew right away the crime involved people from a non-white background. The tip off? No pictures were shown of the killer or his victims. Some people have commented on Christmas being celebrated by people from a Muslim background. I think it may be that the younger members were semi-westernized and this was why. Note how the older father was a hard-core Muslim and probably hated this just as much as his children not being under his crushing control.

					No pictures were shown of the killer right away because the identities of all the dead and the killer weren&rsquo;t known right away. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve seen articles where white criminals victims were not shown right away. Another thing, I don&rsquo;t think this is an &#8216;honor&rsquo; killing as the phenomenon has been generally reported on. These kinds of killings seem to be carried out on a female member of the family with all the rest of the family participating either directly or as co-conspirators. His cultural background may have played a role but as far as that goes then I can often tell if certain crimes have been committed by white people without having to see their pictures. Not always right though.

					&#8220;Rocky Mountain,&#8221; you sure seem to be in a hurry to apologize for this guy. Why is that?
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;Whites do it, too!&#8221; is a subconscious admission that the crime took place, that non-Whites are responsible, and that it is unusually grotesque or brutal. It is the first crack in the dam that holds back racial awareness. Embrace it, admit you&rsquo;re thinking and feeling it, and give yourself permission to not believe the controlled media.
				</p>
				<p>
					One more thing: There&rsquo;s a word that starts with &#8220;N.&#8221; Say it, in your own head if nothing else. Thinking and saying that word will prove that your mind it not under control. The word is &#8220;No.&#8221; I know what word you <i>thought</i> I was talking about. And I just got you to think it.

				<p>
					Could you provide an example of this? Which &#8220;certain crimes&#8221; are committed by Whites that one wouldn&rsquo;t have to see photos to know? Serial murders?
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>African Americans and Serial Killing in the Media, The Myth and the Reality</i>
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Two of the stereotypes surrounding serial killers are that they are almost always White males and that African American males are barely represented in their ranks. Relative to the African American proportion of the population, African Americans are overrepresented in the ranks of serial killers by a factor of about two.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The media run endless documentaries about the 40-year old Manson or Zodiac cases but how many times has anyone see the Zebra case mentioned? How many even <i>know</i> about the mass black-on-White murders committed by black &#8220;Death Angels&#8221; as part of an initiation rite?
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>The Zebra Killings of the 1970′s specifically targeted Whites for random killing, including young women and children, and was the most prolific murder ring in American history&hellip; investigators pegged the number at 71 murders and suspected even more in outlying districts.</i>

					Yes, I remember it well. This is what should not be forgotten and widely known: Muhammad and his accomplice avoided arrest and were able to kill more people because Police Chief Moose and the media were positive that the killer was White.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the Washington Post, police stopped Muhammad&rsquo;s blue 1990 Chevrolet Caprice at least ten different times during the search for the sniper and ran the plates, but saw no reason to link the car to the sniper attacks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also covered up was the fact that Malvo and Muhammad were hunting Whites. Malvo revealed during his trial:
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Muhammad planned to kill six white people a day for 30 days, a total of 180 people. His aim was to slaughter white people. .</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://goo.gl/SXEaw" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/SXEaw</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					As an end note to this sick case, Muhammad told the judge he wanted the various appeals in his case to cease, &#8216;so that you can murder this innocent black man.&rsquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					What you don&rsquo;t know could get you killed, thanks to a national media that continue to cover up or downplay black-on-White murders or non-White killings in general.
