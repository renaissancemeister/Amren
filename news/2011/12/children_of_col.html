<h1><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19550726">Children of Color to Make Up Majority of Colorado&rsquo;s Under-18 Population by 2021</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Auge, Denver Post, December 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By 2021, children of color will make up the majority of Colorado&rsquo;s under-18 population, a milestone that will be achieved in part because of the rapid growth of children born to immigrant parents, according to data compiled by the Colorado Children&rsquo;s Campaign.</p>
<p>The change in the state&rsquo;s demographic landscape reflects what is happening around the country, said Lisa Piscopo of the children&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>The report, released Wednesday, predicts the demographic shift will have broad implications for the state&rsquo;s economy and education system, and it calls on state leaders to ensure that children of immigrants aren&rsquo;t left behind.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Children of color already make up half the young people in 15 Colorado counties, including Denver, Adams, Arapahoe and Pueblo, as well as much of the San Luis Valley.</p>
<p>In 2009, nearly a quarter of Colorado&rsquo;s kids  &mdash;  about 254,000  &mdash;  were children of immigrant parents, and the vast majority, about 87 percent, were born in this country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationally, Colorado&rsquo;s income gap between immigrant and non-immigrant families is second only to Nebraska&rsquo;s, according to the study.</p>
<p>Kids of immigrant parents are also less likely to do well in school. Last year in Colorado, only 5 percent of fourth-graders who are not native English speakers could read at grade level. By comparison, 45 percent of fourth-graders fluent in English could read at grade level. That achievement gap was the second greatest in the country, according to the children&rsquo;s campaign data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if not a single additional immigrant entered the state, the growth trend would probably continue, the report concludes.</p>
<p>Such growth is driven by immigrants who are already here having children, not by those coming into the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;That train,&#8221; Piscopo said, &#8220;has already left the station.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Children of color&#8221;   &mdash;   that phrase, like &#8220;people of color,&#8221; gives the author&rsquo;s game away.  And the game is white self-hatred.  No self-respecting black uses the term to describe himself except making common cause with Leftist whites dumb enough to join them.  </p>
<p>The Denver area is in for some rough times.  </p>

<p>How about having a headline with a bit more reality than this like:  &#8220;Schools Face Massive Teacher Shortage Due To Implosion Of Pension Funds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or: &#8220;Street rioting over austerity measures causes schools to close.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or: &#8220;Black/Hispanic armed conflicts a growing problem throughout the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or:  &#8220;Black/Hispanic joblessness reaches 40%&#8221; </p>

		<p>What is truly breathtaking here is that this is, of course, presented as some wonderful &#8220;vibrancy&#8221; added to the populace and &#8220;enrichment&#8221; of our culture, etc, etc. But look at what the article really says? These people have brought nothing wonderful to Colorado! They are poor, ill-educated and destined to do little more than re-create the type of environment they come from in their home lands, though probably not quite as backward due to the inflow of entitlements, welfare, and what not all on the American taxpayer&rsquo;s dime. But when the monies run out&hellip;</p>

		<p>I live in Colorado. I think that the numbers listed in the report are understated. It is an absolute deluge! As for the cultural climate: You do not dare drive down Federal Blvd. on cinco de mayo! You will be attacked!</p>
<p>I have worked in the school districts in 2 of the counties mentioned and others and I can tell you that enourmous resources go to the illegal alien kids at the expense of the American kids. In fact, the administrators and many of the teachers give the Mexican kids a far higher priority than the native English speakers. That goes for Denver Public Schools, Adams 14 Schools, and Boulder Valley schools and others.  </p>
<p>In fact, up until about the year 2000, Denver Public Schools did not really try to teach English to Spanish speaking kids, they were letting them go through years of school in bilingual classrooms (Spanish speaking, not truly bilingual) and letting them graduate, when they did graduate, without learning English after years of schooling! </p>
<p>I have also seen many, many incidents of preferential treatment for illegal immigrants and minority children who are citizens. There is even a Denver Public school that is called an international school and it espouses globalism and belittles patriotism to the U.S.</p>
<p>As for the anchor babies, yes, the numbers of illegal anchor babies are tremendous! </p>
<p>Black kids run wild and get away with outrageous behavior with impunity. There have even been murders at Montbello High School that are at least partly due to the lax discipline for minority kids. Administrators seldom take action on extremely egregious and violent behavior and extreme defiance on the part ot black kids! </p>
<p>The anti-white racism is rampant but the administrators as well as the students don&rsquo;t think that there is such a thing as anti-white racism (because they are such ego- and ethno-centric racists). The racism extends to many of the teachers and administrators in many districts in Colorado. It manifests as taking sides whenever there is any conflict or disagreement between students, teachers, administrators and any combination thereof. The whites in power favor the minorities. The minorities in power favor the minorities. It gets very vindictive and petty indeed, especially in the more &#8220;politically correct&#8221; districts. </p>

		<p>The only thing which might push this timeline back is that Hispanics in America after the first generation or two settle down into fecundity levels not much higher than white Americans or Mexicans in Mexico.  This high fecundity is basically a recent immigrant thing.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The report, released Wednesday, predicts the demographic shift will have broad implications for the state&rsquo;s economy and education system,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed it will. And if people want to know exactly what kind of broad implications this demographic shift will have on Colorado&rsquo;s state economy and its education system, they only need to turn their heads to the south, towards Mexico and Latin America. </p>
<p>Here we have two nations, the USA and Mexico, both of whom have been sovereign and independent for some two centuries. The former turned into the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth, while the latter never managed to pull itself much above upper third world status. What do you think is going to happen when you move tens of millions of Mexicans a couple of thousand miles to the North? Will they by some act of magic turn into first world citizens and be able to maintain a first world nation (something they never manage to do on their own over centuries) or will they drag their new habitats down to the level of their old ancestral homelands?  Even a child could answer this question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to call people I disagree with, wrong in the head, but many intelligent liberals really must be suffering from some kind of mental disconnect from reality. It&rsquo;s like a colorblindness of sorts. They seem to be able to use their intellect to circumvent the obvious truth, and convince their own minds, that what is right in front of their own eyes isn&rsquo;t really there.  I don&rsquo;t think much can be done about this. I guess we will just have to accept the fact that a certain number or whites will never be able to see the truth, or to have any interest in the preservation of the white race and western civilization. They will be standing with one foot in their self dug graves and still hate the white man. Well, so be it. I really don&rsquo;t care much what happens to them. We should instead focus our energy on the people who at some point will be willing to join our cause, when they finally are able to see what is happening.  <br>

		<p>There are a few states, namely California, New York, Texas and now Colorado that I hope burn in the multicultural hell they enthusiastically created for themselves&hellip; As a 25 year old, it will be fun as an adult to watch these states sink into 3rd world bankrupt status in the coming decades. </p>

		<p>I love the use of the term &#8220;milestone&#8221;.</p>
<p>If this were a gentrifying black or Hispanic neighborhood, it would be a &#8220;troubling new trend,&#8221; or a &#8220;disturbing shift in traditional communities,&#8221; or some other such garbage, even if those communities had been there only 1/5th as long as European people have been in Colorado. </p>
<p>Wake up, &#8220;people Not of color&#8221; or whatever the PC term for whites would be: These folks on the far left DO NOT acknowledge the right of you and your family and your communities to exist at all. To them your ethnic cleansing is a &#8220;milestone&#8221;! They said it right there, plain as day. <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault, right?  Yeah, let&rsquo;s use this as an excuse to raise taxes on whites, leech off of them, beat them up, rape their women, kill them and take their property.  It&rsquo;s worked so well for blacks in Zimbabwe!</p>

<p>So tell us again how having more low IQ (nonwhite) immigrants adds value?  Every state and county and country that has a nonwhite majority has poor infrastructure, lootings, thefts, beatings, killings and all other wonderful multicultural benefits that liberals have pushed onto the average white person for the past 60 years now.</p>

		<p>Colorado was SWPL central for decades. Probably still is. Highly prestigious, feminized, government service economy, very expensive real estate speculation, a playground for the upper middle class yuppies. A horrible place to have a family, absolutely non-viable in the long term except for the cockroach underclass.</p>

		<p>I think that this author is more about left political agenda and perception creation than reality. Colorado surely has lots of Latinos but blax are only 4.0%. Non-hispanic whites are 70% and official statistics say that with hispanic whites ( like myself )it is 81.3%. My ancestors did not come from Mexico. They came to the area from Spain before the state become part of United States. I&rsquo;m American. I know Spanish fluently, but only because I always wanted to know this language. Black birth rate in US is low and stagnant. Latino birth rate is collapsing. It follows what happens in Mexico and the rest of Latin America.</p>

<p>___________</p>
<p>You are the second person to mention this, like somehow that will save us. You do realize that high-fertility invaders keep coming and coming and breeding and breeding?</p>
<p>Later generations do have lower fertility rates, but they are still significantly higher than our rate, which is below the replacement rate. And the damage done by the first generation can&rsquo;t be undone.</p>

		<p>Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, North Dakota, and Iowa will be good places to come.  There are a significant number of blacks and mexicans here who have pride, and are willing to assimilate to civilization as well.  The high-IQ European culture, civility, and infrastructure is well represented, with the best of other groups as well.  </p>
<p>I expect Whites will begin to congregate in the Upper Midwest over time, with a select group of Blacks/Mexicans who choose to live at high standards.</p>

		<p>14 Bobster:</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t save us, but it will push back our ultimate day of reckoning back several years.  All I&rsquo;m saying is that these crossover &#8220;milestones&#8221; are usually off because they assume Hispanic fertility always stays that high.  But, thinking out loud here, what might mean that it happens sooner than advertised is that the white population is over-counted by counting obviously non-white people as white.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really incredible that blacks are only 4% of the population in Colorado. You used to never see one in some areas, now you see several a minute in the least black areas. They&rsquo;re everywhere and they&rsquo;ve invaded the suburbs! ¡Mayates por todos lados!</p>
