			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lydia Warren, Daily Mail (London), December 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Punched to the ground, left bruised, brain damaged and sometimes even dead  &mdash;  these are the vulnerable victims of an increasingly popular &#8216;game&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Knockout King&rsquo; is the frightening phenomenon that has claimed lives across the country as teenagers and young adults seek out sick thrills.</p>
<p>In the planned attacks, a group will appoint a leader and then choose a defenceless victim at random.</p>
<p>They punch the victim to the ground, sometimes filming the attack on mobile phones.</p>
<p>Reports from across the country  &mdash;  including Massachusetts, New Jersey and Chicago  &mdash;  have identified victims as immigrants, elderly and often alone.</p>
<p>Films of the attacks are then uploaded to social networking sites or YouTube, in turn fuelling others to create copycat videos, experts believe.</p>
<p>The FBI does not keep records on the number of Knockout King attacks, but St. Louis Police Chief Dan Isom told the Associated Press the city has seen about 10 Knockout King attacks over the past 15 months.</p>
<p>&#8216;These individuals have absolutely no respect for human life,&rsquo; St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said.</p>
<p>One recent example that sparked outrage across the country was footage that surfaced from a Chicago train station.</p>
<p>A group of young males were seen following an elderly homeless man, before punching him in the face and knocking him out. The youths then jumped on a train, laughing at their sickening exploits.</p>
<p>The horrific video received a quarter of a million views within two days after it was posted on a hip hop website.</p>
<p>The teenager who had punched the man was not arrested as police were unable to track down the man to see if he wanted to press charges.</p>
<p>Another even less fortunate victim was retired teacher Hoang Nguyen, 72, who had moved from Vietnam to St. Louis, Missouri to be closer to his daughter.</p>
<p>He was returning to his apartment with his wife after a daytime trip to the grocery store when they were approached by a group in an alley.</p>
<p>Stepping in front of his wife, Hoang was savagely beaten by the youths and died from his injuries.</p>
<p>Elex Murphy, 18, was charged with first-degree murder and allegedly told police the attack was part of the Knockout King game. </p>
<p>One victim who lived to tell his tale was Matthew Quain, 51, who was randomly attacked in St. Louis in October.</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&rsquo;t remember much of what happened,&rsquo; Quain, who was found lying in a pool of blood by the city mayor, told the Associated Press.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was hanging out with a friend, celebrating the Cardinals in the World Series. I went to the store and saw a group of kids who looked out of place, suspicious, but I shrugged it off.</p>
<p>&#8216;I got around to the library, and the next thing I remember is waking up on the corner with the mayor standing next to me. I tried to say &#8220;hi&#8221; but my jaw was broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Quain, who works in a pizza restaurant in the city, suffered a broken jaw and a cracked skull and still has headaches and memory problems.</p>
<p>Despite raising money through fundraisers he is unsure how he will pay his medical bills.</p>
<p>Experts believe the phenomenon is driven by a thirst for attention.</p>
<p>&#8216;We know that juveniles don&rsquo;t think out consequences clearly,&rsquo; Beth Huebner, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, told the Associated Press.</p>
<p>&#8216;They see something on YouTube and say, &#8220;I want to get that sort of attention, too.&#8221; They don&rsquo;t think about the person they&rsquo;re attacking maybe hitting their head.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not thrilled with this article.  It&rsquo;s part of the racial cover-up.  And if you&rsquo;re so foolish to think that Knockout Martin Luther King isn&rsquo;t a racial hate crime, (at least in the St. Louis context, where the most brutal KMLK incidents have happened), then I request of thee:  Show me the non-black perpetrators and/or the black victims of KMLK.</p>

<p>&#8220;Experts believe the phenomenon is driven by a thirst for attention.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
No, it&rsquo;s driven by sub-Saharan genetics. It&rsquo;s driven by black males&rsquo; higher testosterone combined with their lower impulse control. It&rsquo;s driven by the fact that black people are, on average, both larger and dumber than White or Asian people. It&rsquo;s driven by the fact that back in Mother Africa, gangs outnumbering and overpowering innocent civilians   &mdash;   whether for robbery, for rape, or for just mindless brutal kicks like this repulsive formalizing of the suckerpunch they&rsquo;re calling &#8220;The Knockout Game&#8221;   &mdash;   is <i>a totally normal and accepted part of everyday life.</i> </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that Africa&rsquo;s a terribly violent place. And Africans are a terribly violent people   &mdash;   regardless of whose citizenship or passport they might happen to be holding. From the Bronx to the Bahamas to the Bongo Congo, African behavior is universal. </p>
<p>These gruesome, sadistic, barbaric &#8220;games&#8221; we&rsquo;re seeing played in StL and elsewhere are, therefore, merely another case of what Jared Taylor has memorably dubbed &#8220;Africa in our midst.&#8221; </p>

<p>Of course, it couldn&rsquo;t be fueled by a lifetime of racial grievance and a hatred of other races, could it? No, of course not! It&rsquo;s just a &#8220;desire for attention,&#8221; that&rsquo;s all. Only whites are capable of racial hatred. Just ignore the racial makeup of the victims. The writer and rag that published this article, while clucking their tongues at the barbarities, are just part of the coverup.</p>

		<p>They deliberately left out the main word in all of this, just like all our domestic media does, and that word is &#8220;black&#8221;. They keep using the tired old terms such as &#8220;youths&#8221; as a cover-up. Every such racial attack is always described as &#8220;random&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a black activity, an urban black sport. It&rsquo;s also been going on for years and this paper just now notices it? </p>

		<p>I would highly recommend Target Focus Training (TFT) for people who are vulnerable.  It&rsquo;s easy to learn and it will more than give these types what THEY intend to send.  When they are in the hospital without one of their eyes, or with a broken ankle, broken leg and ruptured gonads, they&rsquo;ll think twice about doing something like that again!</p>

		<p>Actually it has nothing to do with seeing someone on Youtube and wanting attention.  It is simply due to the fact that these &#8220;youths&#8221; (black youths, to be absolutely clear) are simply reverting to typical African violence.  If they knew what necklacing was, we&rsquo;d have a rash of incidents.  They are lacking in moral development.</p>

They don&rsquo;t think about it because they just plain don&rsquo;t care. It isn&rsquo;t because of their age, either. It&rsquo;s because the victim is non-black and vulnerable.  </p>

		<p>Interesting that this sort of thing is gaining international attention. One wonders if American flash mobs are not related to farm attacks in the rainbow nation of South Africa, urban rioting in Britain, car burnings in Europe, etc. A sort of general urban guerrilla warfare carried out by &hellip; the &#8220;youths.&#8221; </p>

<p>I wonder. Can the &#8220;youths&#8221; who are committing these crimes even consider long term consequences? Is there a genetic component at work here? </p>

<p>1. This is the type of behavior as would be seen in the wild. The jungle predatory beast attacking that prey least able to defend itself. The old, the sick, the infirm, the young, etc. These &#8220;human&#8221; predators have a mental process in selecting prey, whether they realize it or not, identical to the predator animal.</p>

<p>2. NO!! These fiends are doing what they are doing because they derive a perverse and sickening pleasure from the act. ENJOYMENT! NO other reason. A sick and terribly distorted mentality for which there is not one thing that can be done. </p>
<p>This Daily Mail too is the English press. NOT willing to mention the racial aspect to all this. BANTU attacking those most vulnerable. American press ain&rsquo;t a whole lot better. </p>

		<p>Typical perfidious journalism   &mdash;  NO mention that the &#8220;Knockout Kings&#8221; are black.  All of them.  No call for Whites to arm and protect themselves and their children against vicious, marauding blacks who HUNT for Whites and Asians to assault. No call for police or political action or harsh punishments to put an immediate halt to gratuitous black violence.</p>
<p>This will spread to England where the same tired excuses will be made for black pathological behavior.</p>
<p>But when have the msm ever felt the need to protect, advocate or promote anything White?</p>
<p><i>Experts believe the phenomenon is driven by a thirst for attention.</i></p>
<p>It is not a phenomenon; it is typical black behavior and is driven by innate black psychopathology, amorality, love of wanton violence and an intense hatred of non-blacks, especially Whites.</p>
<p><i>One recent example that sparked outrage across the country was footage</i></p>
<p>Outrage?  This is where REAL White outrage should be directed: </p>
<p><b>The teenager who punched the man was not arrested</b></p>
<p>Yet a 16-year old kid gets on a loudspeaker at a Walmart as a prank and announces &#8220;Will all the black people leave the store. Thank you.&#8221;  and it becomes National News:</p>
<p>No arrest for vicious assaults by &#8220;Knockout Kings&#8221;: <i> [Black] males were seen following an elderly homeless man, before punching him in the face and knocking him out.</i></p>
<p>Yet the 16-year old White kid?  </p>
<p><i>Police have arrested a 16-year-old boy in the case of a racial comment that was made over the public-address system at a Walmart store on charges of harassment and bias intimidation.</i></p>
<p>Ask who the real enemies are who allow, cover up and then excuse black-on-White murderous assaults.  </p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that, quietly, the gun laws in this country are being made less restrictive and more states are allowing people to carry guns. Permits are at record numbers in many of them, as are the sale of guns. Most people are not stupid and can see the writing on the wall. The police, nor the courts, can protect you. It&rsquo;s becoming more apparent each day that you need to be responsible for your own protection. The NRA, for all its faults, is basically the only organization standing between our freedom to defend ourselves and those who would disarm us (as they have in Britain, and how&rsquo;s that working out for them?).</p>

<p>I wonder how these PBS people can get through this report without laughing.  Except I do know how:  They&rsquo;re such the slaves of their anthropological egalitarianism that they take the black/juvenile antics that were the life and times of &ldquo;General Butt Naked&rdquo; seriously.  Normal people would roll around on the floor laughing out loud.  Except that normal people are &ldquo;racists,&rdquo; PBS anchors are truly the enlightened among us.</p>

<p>Almost all juveniles don&rsquo;t think out consequences clearly.  That&rsquo;s just the nature of being an adolescent.  But not all juveniles go around engaging in sometimes murderous &#8220;games&#8221; (really, hate crimes) because their brain is undeveloped.  </p>

<p>I mostly agree with your fundamental contention, but I&rsquo;m going to nuance it a little bit.</p>
<p>In the last two decades or so, the verve in public policy has been to both encourage non-criminals to be armed as regularly as possible and reduce or eliminate any criminal or civil liability that might have happened in earnest of their using deadly force to defend their lives, and to disarm as many habitual criminals as possible, simultaneously.  This isn&rsquo;t true everywhere, but it&rsquo;s the general trend.</p>
<p>Therefore, here in 2011, it is more likely now than 20 years ago that in a situation where a habitual criminal meets a habitual non-criminal, that the non-criminal has a gun and the criminal doesn&rsquo;t.  Twenty years ago, it was the opposite.</p>
<p>Examples of this policy shift are:  CCW in more states and permits in the hands of more qualified people, repudiating &#8220;duty to retreat&#8221; in favor of the &#8220;castle doctrine,&#8221; shielding those that use weapons in self-defense from civil liability, vigorous enforcement of &#8220;felon in possession of firearms&#8221; laws, even if it&rsquo;s only to extract snitching, enhanced penalties for violent crimes committed with a firearm or other deadly weapon, using &#8220;process&#8221; or &#8220;technicality&#8221; weapons offenses as leverage to extract snitching from the &#8220;stop snitching&#8221; crowd, or as the safety fallback &#8220;victimless&#8221; crime which the DA can plead down to in exchange for prison time, three strikes and you&rsquo;re out, truth in sentencing laws, mandatory minimum sentences.  I predict that in relatively short order, two more things contributing to that will be national or near-national CCW reciprocity, either by Federal legislation or by a uniform convention of existing carry states, and that many states will amend their constitutions to prohibit a Governor from pardoning an incarcerated felon or commuting his sentence without the approval of the state legislature.</p>

Let me get this straight.</p>
<p>This guy Quain gets a broken jaw, concussion and memory loss through no fault of his own and now the financial burden falls upon his shoulders to pay the medical bills? Forget the fundraisers, force the state/ federal government to pay for white victims of non- white crime! Ever since 1948 western governments have been alienating whites in their own homelands. Whites victimizing and discriminating against other whites on behalf of other races. This is pure racial perversion! </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their policies which are causing this slow- motion train wreak against their own race. </p>
<p>So make them pay! </p>

		<p>In defense of the UK Daily mail.</p>
<p>Of course I, like all of us, would prefer that the press explicitly state the obvious, that the perps are always black and the crimes generally have a racial animus component - blacks attacking non-blacks.</p>
<p>However I have found that the Mail gives excellent and extensive coverage to BBB - blacks behaving badly - matters, especially for events in the US which is not their primary area of concern. While not explicitly saying &#8216;BLACK&rsquo; the Mail is great for including lots of photos, usually way more than other papers (see their London riots stories for example) and they know the photos tell the racial story.</p>
<p>Lastly, in this story they included a photo and video of a Chicago attack in which the victim was an elderly black man sucker-punched by a young black thug, laughing.</p>
<p>The Mail is indeed getting the story out about black savagery and better than much of the US press while nominally remaining politically correct by not hammering the message home with the word &#8216;BLACK&rsquo; used very much. They are serving our cause just as Drudge is and very effectively. They show the racial facts but don&rsquo;t lay themselves open to an SPLC attack due to un-PC explicit text. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this is how the game must be played by prominent media at this time.</p>

I have been fortunate enough never to have been the victim of street crime, despite having lived in America&rsquo;s #1 and #2 cities. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what to attribute this good fortune, as I am not particularly large or threatening; and I can&rsquo;t even claim to have been particularly careful (e.g. falling asleep on NYC subways at 2am and other needlessly risky behaviors). </p>
<p>But in all my travels I have also maintained a certain &#8220;stance&#8221; on the streets, and tried (so far with success, apparently) to project the appearance to street thugs that I shouldn&rsquo;t be their first choice amongst potential victims. Maybe their third or fourth choice, but not the first. The look that random gangtas get from me silently says to them, &#8220;If you homies are planning on jumping some white boy tonight, better pick some OTHER white boy to jump, cuz this one&rsquo;s gonna fight back.&#8221; So they go jump somebody else instead. </p>
<p>But back to the eyes: a cheap and legal weapon that everyone can carry is a retractable ballpoint pen, located within easy reach. I won&rsquo;t leave the house without one in my pants pocket. If my luck ever runs out and I&rsquo;m attacked, I am prepared to grab the pen and aim for the face. Preferably the eyes, but really anywhere on the face should state your case to your attacker pretty clearly. Will it make your attacker relent? Maybe or maybe not   &mdash;   but it should at least slow them down, and buy you some precious time. </p>
<p>The thought of putting someone&rsquo;s eye out is disturbing, and under normal circumstances neither I nor I&rsquo;m sure anyone else reading this would ever WANT to do it. But when you live in a place where you can&rsquo;t carry a gun it&rsquo;s better than nothing. </p>

		<p>@Bon The reason the 16 yr old White kid was arrested for his &#8220;horrific act of hate&#8221; and the black &#8220;youth&#8221; was not arrested for his &#8220;understandable act of teen angst&#8221; was because it is much more important to make sure that black people&rsquo;s feelings are not hurt than it is to be concerned about White people maintaining the integrity of their skulls.</p>
<p>Just as it is much more important for &#8220;evil doers&#8221; like Emma West to be incarcerated and children taken away for hurting non-White folks feelings than it is for the English authority to control the flood of third worlders who have come to &#8220;enrich&#8221; England with their &#8220;morally superior&#8221; culture. </p>
