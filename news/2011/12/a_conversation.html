He is perhaps the world&rsquo;s best-known scholar in the field of racial differences in intelligence. Ever since 1969, when his article, &#8220;How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?&#8221;, appeared in the&nbsp;<i>Harvard Educational Review,</i>&nbsp;he has been at the center of what is probably the most controversial of all academic fields. Prof. Jensen has been widely reviled, but his patient research and keen analysis have now won a position of near-unanimity for his views   &mdash;   at least among specialists.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">What follow are excerpts from a several-hour conversation with Prof. Jensen, in which he talks about race, intelligence, sex differences, eugenics, and the future of the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>American Renaissance:</b>&nbsp;You are probably most famous, still, for that&nbsp;<i>Harvard Educational Review</i>&nbsp;article.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Prof. Jensen:</b>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s true, yes. I think that&rsquo;s probably one of the most over-cited articles in the history of psychology.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;Well, I&rsquo;ve always assumed that article got the incredible amount of attention that it did because this was really the first time after the Second World War that someone had stated that there could very well be a genetic factor that accounts for the difference in black and white achievement.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;Right, yes. It&rsquo;s the first time that it had really been stated explicitly in the academic literature since before World War II.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;Why were you the person to first do that? What prompted you?</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;I became involved in this subject the year [1967] that I spent at the Center for the Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, the Palo Alto [CA] think tank. I went there that year to write a book on the psychology of the culturally disadvantaged. I felt that I should have one short chapter about the inheritance of mental ability, if only to dismiss the subject. That was the standard stance at the time.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;That was your view at the time?</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;Yes, that was my view at the time. I knew next to nothing about the subject, except that I had heard Sir Cyril Burt give the &#8220;Walter Van Dyke Bingham Address&#8221; at the American Psychological Association. I&rsquo;d mainly gone just to see the most famous British psychologist. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in the subject particularly, but it stuck with me because it was a brilliant lecture.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">There also happened to be a geneticist at the think tank that year, and I became acquainted with him. He put me on a sort of reading course in this area so that I could learn more about it, the technical aspect of it. It was the year after that that I wrote the&nbsp;<i>HER</i>&nbsp;[<i>Harvard Educational Review</i>] article, in 1968, and it was published in the Spring of 1969.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">And it was there that I met [William] Shockley. We got together periodically to talk about some of these things.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;Dr. Shockley had taken a public position on these questions before you had?</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;Oh, yes; in two talks. One that he gave at the Commonwealth Club, here in San Francisco, and one that he gave at the National Academy of Sciences. This was in 1967. It was the first time he stuck his neck out on this.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;What do you think accounts for the ferocious opposition to your views   &mdash;   especially then   &mdash;   but which continues up to today?</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;It continues today, yes. For one thing, people have been taught from early childhood   &mdash;   and it&rsquo;s especially true of better-educated people   &mdash;   that all people are essentially the same, except for very superficial differences due to their social background and advantages in upbringing and so forth. To suggest anything else offends this deep conviction. In fact, I was brought up very much that way. My own parents, especially my mother   &mdash;   my father was more hard-headed and tough-minded   &mdash;   but my own mother thought it was just outrageous that I had written that&nbsp;<i>HER</i>&nbsp;article. The view being a very common one today, still, that blacks would be no different from the rest of us   &mdash;   the rest of the population   &mdash;   if they simply had the same education and all of that.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Even among a single racial group there&rsquo;s a great sensitivity about individual differences in the trait of intelligence. This is probably the most highly valued trait. When people are asked what characteristics they want their children most to have, the two things they mention first are good health and good intelligence. If you suggest that people differ in intelligence for reasons that they themselves are not responsible for, because of the particular assortment of genes they happen to get, this seems terribly unfair.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s an aspect of this that&rsquo;s particularly curious, and that&rsquo;s the fact that at the turn of the century there was a very strong acceptance, it seems, or a very strong movement towards acceptance of genetic differences by men like Sir Francis Galton and Karl Pearson. Even in the United States, very reputable people became advocates of eugenics.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;I think that World War II was really the main turning point in this. We&rsquo;d been headed in that direction [egalitarianism], but the turning point, I think, was the revulsion against the Nazi Holocaust. People pointed to that as an example of what would happen if we recognized differences.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Of course it&rsquo;s very inapplicable really, because the group that was persecuted there was the group that was doing very well in Germany and around the world. It had a larger percentage of Nobel Prize winners and members of the National Academy of Sciences and Fellows of Royal Societies than any other group.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s my understanding that in fact there&rsquo;s no record that Hitler even said that Jews were inferior anyway.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right, yes. They had other reasons for their views. But this [the Holocaust] was still given as an example of the result of making racial or ethnic distinctions between groups.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;I know that in the past Stephen Jay Gould, Leon Kamin and a few other people have been widely and popularly quoted as maintaining a strictly environmental point of view.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right. Well, certainly Kamin does; I&rsquo;m not so sure about Gould. He does on the race difference issue, no doubt about that, but on individual differences in intelligence he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a strict environmentalist. He&rsquo;s too much of a biologist for that. Kamin is, but whether Kamin believes this privately or not, I can&rsquo;t be sure. He seems to me to be too intelligent to really believe what he says.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;You think that what he says might very well simply be what he thinks people should think?</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;I think so. I think that is probably it. But then, I can&rsquo;t accuse him of that, because that would be accusing him of dishonesty. I know he&rsquo;s a very learned and bright person, and he&rsquo;s a sane person basically, which some people in the opposition aren&rsquo;t.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;Well, I guess what I&rsquo;m driving at is whether or not there really are any people left in the psychometric community, or in intelligence testing, or serious applied biology, who do think   &mdash;   and are willing to say publicly   &mdash;   that racial differences in achievement are strictly a matter of environment?</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;I know almost none myself. I&rsquo;ve looked for such persons. When my book&nbsp;<i>Bias in Mental Testing</i>&nbsp;came out in 1980,&nbsp;<i>Time</i>&nbsp;magazine ran a full-page story about it. Then they got so many complaints about that article because it didn&rsquo;t tear down my position at all. The same writer called me and said that they had gotten so many complaints that they had promised people they would bring out another article on the same subject after a certain amount of opinion had accumulated about my book. They would report this and it would satisfy the opposition.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Then they called me perhaps a month later and asked me if I could suggest anyone who might disagree with the main conclusions of this book, because they hadn&rsquo;t been able to find anyone. I said, &#8220;Well, have you contacted Kamin?&#8221; And I mentioned a couple of other people. They said, &#8220;Yes, we thought of them first, but what they have to say sounds so weak that it wouldn&rsquo;t satisfy our readership that we&rsquo;ve done a job on this thing. Is there anyone else you could suggest?&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">So I mentioned a couple of very competent psychometricians around the country. I didn&rsquo;t know quite what their stands were, but I knew they were competent people who would be capable of criticizing this type of work and would likely have seen my book by that time. They called them, but they got nothing that they could use against me, so they never did the article. Now that would have been news itself, but it didn&rsquo;t make the news.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">One person who takes the opposite side on the race issue, not on the [test] bias issue, but on the race issue particularly, who I think is a respectable scientist, is James R. Flynn. He&rsquo;s in New Zealand, at the University of Otago. He&rsquo;s a professor of Political Science. I don&rsquo;t agree with everything [he says] and I think he weights different items of information very differently than I would, or many others would. But he does seem to be a sensible and intelligent person without any very obvious ideological ax to grind.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;It sounds as though, in effect, you have to go all the way to New Zealand to find someone who is not an obvious ideologue with an obvious ax to grind who will take a reasoned and intelligent position that is opposed to yours.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right, yes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;I understand that there are more or less physiological assessments of intelligence   &mdash;   reaction time correlates with height and myopia [all of which correlate with intelligence]. It seems to me, if the general public, or perhaps more importantly, the people who run the media, are to be made to accept the notion of genetic origins of individual and perhaps racial differences, then something like direct physiological assessment might be more convincing to them than IQ tests.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;Oh, I think so, yes. You see the black/white difference is mainly a difference in this&nbsp;<i>g</i>&nbsp;factor that I talk about. The term was invented by [Charles] Spearman way back in 1904. If one does factor analysis on a whole battery of tests to determine the degree to which each of the tests measures this general factor that&rsquo;s common to all cognitive tests   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t care what the test is; it can be as bizarre as anything you can imagine   &mdash;   if it measures cognitive ability, if it measures some kind of mental effort, however slight or however varied, it will measure this&nbsp;<i>g</i>factor. Those&nbsp;<i>g</i>&nbsp;loadings, as they&rsquo;re called, of the various tests, will predict quite well the degree to which whites and blacks differ on that test. Blacks and whites differ hardly at all on some tests, but they differ a lot on others. The thing that predicts the size of the black/white difference is the&nbsp;<i>g</i>&nbsp;loading of the test. Really nothing else, for all practical purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;Can you describe in words the ones that tend to be the most&nbsp;<i>g</i>&nbsp;loaded?</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;Yes. One of the best tests for measuring&nbsp;<i>g</i>&nbsp;is Raven&rsquo;s Progressive Matrices. I can show you one right here. [Prof. Jensen describes the test   &mdash;   it involves recognizing patterns and making a selection that conforms to that pattern.]</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Everyone is familiar with these kinds of shapes. There is nothing at all esoteric about these things as there would be with, say, a vocabulary test, where the words keep increasing in difficulty because they become rarer words. It&rsquo;s really a test of true reason. It&rsquo;s really inductive reasoning. It measures nothing but&nbsp;<i>g</i>&nbsp;plus error. There&rsquo;s nothing verbal, nothing numerical, nothing spatial, nothing mechanical, nothing musical. I mean it&rsquo;s just pure&nbsp;<i>g</i>.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;How do people who argue that test results are a function of bias in the test respond to a test like that? I can&rsquo;t understand how there could be any cultural bias.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;Well, they will claim there&rsquo;s cultural bias in doing this kind of activity. If the test were really culturally biased one thing we would notice would be that the items in this kind of test should be in a different rank order for different racial-cultural groups. I mean what&rsquo;s hard for one would be easy for another and vice versa. But the rank order of item difficulty on this is exactly the same for blacks and whites.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>AR:</b>&nbsp;In other words, you can&rsquo;t pick out particular questions that seem to be prejudiced against blacks?</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>Jensen:</b>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right. Take the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), for example. This is an interesting one, because again the items in it are also the same for blacks and whites tested in this country, but if you take the PPVT, which was standardized on Americans, and give it in England, as I have done, you find that there are certain items that are way out of rank order of difficulty.</p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">The way the test works, there are four pictures on each page, and you name one of them and the child simply has to point to it. Well, there&rsquo;s one item that something like 75 percent of grammar school kids in this country get right, but Fellows of the Royal Society that I tried it on in England, flunk. It&rsquo;s a picture of a caboose. You say &#8220;caboose&#8221;, and they look puzzled. I&rsquo;ve tried this on Francis Crick [discoverer of DNA and winner of the Nobel Prize], and he said, &#8220;There is no caboose there.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Do you know what a caboose is?&#8221; He said &#8220;Yes, it&rsquo;s a ship&rsquo;s kitchen.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sorry, that&rsquo;s not right.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s right.&#8221; And he took down the Oxford English Dictionary and showed me that in England &#8220;caboose&#8221; means a ship&rsquo;s kitchen. So that&rsquo;s a true cultural difference, you see.</p><table class="quoteright" style="background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); margin-left: 1em; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em; float: right; width: 422px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><tbody><tr><th>The bottom line turns out to be that we can&rsquo;t face the prospect that there are real differences between the various racial and social groups.</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">There are quite a few items that are of different difficulty in England, but it&rsquo;s not true in this country.

Of course, when we do find those genes, I think that&rsquo;ll probably settle the race differences issue, which can&rsquo;t be settled by any known techniques of quantitative genetics, mainly because all of those techniques are for studying the heritability of individual differences in intelligence&nbsp;<i>within</i>&nbsp;racial groups, and it is highly inheritable within all racial groups that have been studied.

If you introduce a child who is in the 80 or so IQ range to reading at the usual age of six, he&rsquo;s much more likely to fail than children with IQs of 100 or higher, and much more likely to be given up on by the time he&rsquo;s at an age at which he could read with the same level of facility as the average six-year-old   &mdash;   that is to say, when he&rsquo;s nine or ten.

I think that to an unfortunate degree the mere fact of racial differences is something that human beings are almost always conscious of.

Whatever the cause, it would be better if these people did not have as many children because the children tend to turn out pretty much like the parents.</p><table class="boxleft" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; font-size: medium; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1992/09/student.gif" height="217" width="200" align="left" alt="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-image: initial; box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; ">You see, the problem with relying entirely on education in these matters, is that these measures don&rsquo;t get to the IQ group below 75.

<p>Jensen: Well, I&rsquo;m merely interested in the preservation of civilization, regardless of where it is. Some people are so afraid, of say, the Asians taking over in this country. Well if they can take over and do a better job than the rest of us, if they preserve the great things of both Western and Asian civilization, well I don&rsquo;t think the world will be worse off.

<p><br>
Hopefully Jensen later came to realize that race precedes civilization.  &#8220;Western&#8221; civilization without whites is not only unacceptable, but unachievable.  Furthermore, every race needs to have a home of its own kind, its &#8220;people&#8221;.  Jensen tries to pretend that he&rsquo;d be OK in a non-white world that &#8216;preserved&rsquo; all things white.  As I said, hopefully he eventually snapped out of this folly.</p>

		<p>I wait. I wait the time when &#8220;hard&#8221;/exact sciences like genetics, biophysics, neurophysiology, ..helped by nanotechnology &amp; more powerful optical devices and sensors have definitively proved that there were scientific paradigmata that UNDOUBTEDLY and IRREFUTABLY explained racial disparities &amp; behavioral patterns on macro-scale by established &amp; powerful theories of genome &amp; brain/hormonal functioning.</p>
<p>Jensen and others have made great strides forward, but this is not exact science.Wishy-washy liberals can twist all sociology, psychology, psychometrics etc. &amp; virtually destroy everything with &#8220;prejudice&#8221; mantra. What they CAN&rsquo;T do is to brush exact sciences aside. The ideological fanaticism had tried this in Soviet Union with Trofim Lysenko &amp; failed miserably.</p>
<p>What we see here is the clash between ideology-primarily Western, stemming from Enlightenment and before, and pushed to the absurd limits- of the liberal dogma that humans are, more or less, the same and can be molded, arbitrarily &amp; almost completely, by education (Rousseau, Kant, Pestalozzi,..). However, another Western invention that has become global, exact science, seems- as far as human nature is concerned- to be going in the opposite direction. And this conflict between ideology based on wishful thinking &amp; scientific discovery can result only in the collapse of the ideology (liberal, communist, crude racialist,..). Science&rsquo;s progress cannot be stopped. If not in the US, it will be done in Russia, Israel, Japan, Germany, China,&hellip;</p>
<p>And the results will be, I surmise, contrary to the fantasies of unbridled social engineering. </p>

<p>I would agree with your statement they are in denial of reality, however, most &#8216;liberals&rsquo; don&rsquo;t deny race reality or racial differences. Not at all. They make their career out of accepting the notion that whites as a group are bad while people of color are always good.</p>

		<p>This has tremendous ramifications for education. This really puts the lie to the notion of &#8220;teacher effectiveness&#8221; based on outcome and test scores. </p>
<p>From a liberal point of view, working with Mexican immigrant kids (from the lowest social classes in Mexico) and black kids is a real social service but, ironically, under a regime in which the teacher is punished for low test scores on the part of the students, it is not a logical course of action and will jeapardized one&rsquo;s future to work with such students. The real irony of this situation is that you can&rsquo;t tell most people this. It is absolutely taboo in mainstream media.</p>
<p>That includes Republicans, they are also very indoctrinated liberals who will not admit IQ or G factor differences in social classes much less races, just like Democrats. </p>
<p>I have broached the subject in very careful and polite ways without mentioning race but only social status with teachers who will not hear of it. They are horrified that I would even think that any group is really inherently less capable than another even though I approached the issue from the standpoint that everyone has the same intrinsic value as a human being but do not have the same inherent abilities. It is totally alien to most and those few who even understand these concepts are absolutely horrified. They are absolutely brainwashed!</p>
<p>As things stand, teachers are penalized for working with groups of students that cannot reasonably be expected to perform on the level of, say, upper middle class students in very affluent suburbs. Success as a teacher thus will depend upon getting a posting with affluent white, Jewish (white too), and, say, Chinese and Japanese students. Intelligent and lucky teachers then will work in affluent suburbs or Beverly Hills and will thus also be the most &#8220;effective teachers.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is depressing to consider that nineteen years after this interview it is still dangerous for many people in many fields to agree publicity with Professor Jensen. <br>
 <br>
Those on the right ignore evidence for man made global warming, but they do not try to suppress that evidence. Those on the left do try to suppress evidence of the importance of genetics in determining differences of intelligence between individuals, and average differences between races. </p>

There are two reasons Orientals will not replace whites in the United States the way Cro Magnons replaced Neanderthals in Europe. First, the differences in average intelligence are too slight. Second, Oriental countries are thriving, so there are plenty of opportunities for Orientals in them. <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, the Orientals who do live her and who move here perform and behave well, so their continued immigration should be allowed. </p>

		<p>I have noted two approaches to Hispanics that I think are incorrect. </p>
<p>1)Assumptions of low IQ based on data (?) based on the poorest Mexican immigrants. I would be surprised to learn that upper class Latin Americans have low IQs.</p>
<p>2)Assumptions that people of Spanish descent are non-white. Spanish people are Mediteranean whites (and Nordic, Alpine, and even Cro-Magnon sometimes). It seems to me that pure Spanish people are not very different from Italians, ethnically. Haven&rsquo;t Italians scored pretty high on IQ tests, comparatively? Shouldn&rsquo;t interethnic comparisons include all social classes?</p>

<p>Here, here. I agree. I would add that from a Darwinian standpoint, and Jensen seems to believe in Darwinian evolutionary priciples, Jensen&rsquo;s attitude demonstrates a total lack of fitness in the sense that he doesn&rsquo;t even have a drive to see his kind and his kin survive and flourish. That is a very unhealthy attitude!</p>

<p>You really think that Asian immigration should continue to be allowed? Is this the standard position of AR? Whites deserve a homeland of our own. Period and regardless of racial IQ.</p>
<p>As for your claim that since Oriental countries are thriving so therefore they will not replace whites in Europe and the US, AR readers on the US west coast (ie, Seattle, Portland, and especially San Francisco/Bay area) would strongly disagree. There are many areas that 25 years ago were 80+ percent white, that are now majority Asian. And they have no intention of leaving their large families in Asia. They continue to arrive in the US. This isn&rsquo;t including all of the &#8220;Vietnam bride/yellow fever&#8221; love affairs that the war 40 years ago gave so many white men.</p>

		<p>Let me make a bold statement. There is going to be a time when people all over the world will recognize that Apartheid was an advanced system long before its time.</p>
<p>Our black (or, as known by some, the &#8216;Bantu) education system made provision for exactly those IQ differences. Also in the white schools we were graded according to performance. I wish I could show you some of the documents in my possession about the approach taken and the successes achieved by it, in contrast to today where, as in the USA, millions are poured down the drain.</p>
<p>But then again, Spengler in his &#8216;Hour of Decision&rsquo; warned us that the whites were digging their own grave by educating the other races.</p>

		<p>The topics that AR and Prof Jensen discuss also exist in South Africa with one fundamental difference - the numbers of black and white are reversed.</p>
<p>A country that matched the infrastructural development of the USA (although on a much smaller scale) was built with the white caucasians in control. </p>
<p>A political system existed which ostensibly (from the white western liberal perspective) oppressed the black population and prevented them from blossoming and developing. Within the same system an Asian community (not Oriental) prospered in the same manner as described in this article.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago the political system was consigned to the trash can and seventeen years ago the control of all instruments of development and power were transfered to the black majority. Since then, without any impediments, absolutely everything they have touched has turned into a failure.</p>
<p>The biggest by-product of the failure of this experiment - forced onto the country lead by people like Henry Kissinger - has been the immigration patterns. A virtual open gates policy now exists for other Africans on the continent. Africans from countries north of the Limpopo River border are flocking into the country to access the most developed economy on the continent. Ironically they tried to do the same during the apartheid regime era and a fence ( = to the USA-Mexico border) had to be built to keep them out. The result is a new crime phenomena post 1994 - xenophobic killings. South African blacks are murdering the foreigner blacks as they fight to the death for jobs at the bottom of the food chain. </p>
<p>Concurrent with this is the departure of the white professional and entrepreneurial class. About 20% of the white population has emigrated to escape crime, discriminatory labour practices and to find a safe place in which to raise their children and create opportunities for them. </p>
<p>Whereas pre 1994 you had 5m whites sustaining 35m blacks, you now have 4m whites unable to sustain 35m local blacks plus an estimated 10m illegal immigrants. The death of white western civilisation as AR fears appears to be inevitable. </p>

&#8220;Nevertheless, the Orientals who do live her and who move here perform and behave well, so their continued immigration should be allowed. &#8220;</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t disagree more.  You ought to travel to Vancouver, BC to see what &#8220;more&#8221; is like.  You may enter entire blocks where if you don&rsquo;t speak Chinese, you can&rsquo;t do business, or be served.  Asians, and in particular Chinese have a very aggressive way of destroying nature, and lately have begun to attack the establishment at universities as a &#8220;minority&#8221; group that deserves &#8220;Asian Studies&#8221; included in the curriculum. </p>
<p>The average Asian is NOT of higher intelligence than the average Western example.  It is the ones that succeed in getting into the U.S. that are already the top of their population that supply the slight IQ advantage over others, who did not have to go through such a strenuous selection process at home.  I have known plenty of sub-par Chinese here in America, IQ wise. </p>
<p>There are over two billion Chinese alone in the world, inviting them to spread into the West is an act of suicide for those of European (or any other) ancestry.  I don&rsquo;t see how anyone who thinks that way would call themselves a race realist or an advocate for the West at all.</p>
