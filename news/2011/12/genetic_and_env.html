<h1><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22139438">Genetic and Environmental Contributions to the Association Between Anthropometric Measures and IQ: A Study of Minnesota Twins at Age 11 and 17</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>K. Silventoinen et al., Pub Med, December 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Associations of height and head circumference with IQ are well documented, but much less is known about the association of IQ with other anthropometric measures or the mechanisms behind these associations. We therefore analyzed the associations between IQ and several anthropometric measures using a twin-study design. Twins born in Minnesota were assessed at either age 11 (756 complete pairs) or 17 (626 complete pairs) and analyzed using genetic modeling. Head circumference and height showed the most consistent positive associations with IQ, whereas more detailed anthropometric measures were not significantly better predictors of IQ. These associations were mainly due to common genetic factors. Our results suggest that the same genetic factors have an effect on physical and cognitive development. Head circumference and height capture information on children&rsquo;s physical development, which is partly associated also with cognitive development.</p>

<p>What was  Emma West the Tram Lady suppose to do? I suppose if you believe that IQ score-race psychometrics is crucial for  waging the revolt against race-replacement, Emma West should have lectured the young pregnant Pakistani mothers on the Tram about the finer points of Murray-Hernstien. Emma West, the Tram Lady shows in a very dramatic way just how irrelevant the mad- calibrator psychometrically obsessed types really are. What matters is what European people  know to be true in their guts.</p>
<p>I really hope that the AR conference this march in Tennessee focuses exclusively on the race-replacement issue..we are running out of time.</p>

		<p>Just keep reporting the truth. Our opponents can&rsquo;t lie forever. &#8220;Name a single legitimate study that shows racial I.Q. differences,&#8221; they say. My standard response is: &#8220;You&rsquo;re being deliberately obtuse. Stop trying to waste my time.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The racial IQ gap has been old news for a while. The latest attempt to account for the emperor&rsquo;s nudity has been to say that tests of general intelligence (g) don&rsquo;t &#8220;actually&#8221; measure cognitive ability, or that the &#8220;type of intelligence&#8221; possessed by blacks (anyone&rsquo;s guess what that is) isn&rsquo;t accounted for in measurements of IQ. <br>
Or my personal favorite, that the test itself is ray-siss.  </p>

<p>And what if it turns out that the twin studies are all flawed? That&rsquo;s how science works..things could be otherwise (for the record there have always been serious critiques of the twin studies). Would this have any consequences for the Native Born White American revolt against race-replacement at the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites such as the Asian invader? No..because scores on an IQ tests are 100 percent irrelevant to the race-replacement issue.</p>
<p>The IQ score enthusiasts will always sidetrack a &#8220;debate&#8221; on White race-replacement with a mind-numbing-the eyes-glaze-over- irrelevant discussion on the finer points of Murray-Hernstien psychometrics. The research is not as strong as IQ score enthusiasts believe it to be..and eventually they will go up against someone who who has a deep conceptual and statistical grasp of the underlying issues..it will not go very well for your side&hellip;but like the 9/11 Truthers you will persist..and in the meantime Native Born White Americans are race-replaced. The foolishness is monumental.<br>

Those who cannot perform adequately are running out of time. The future does not belong to any one race. It belongs to individuals of all races who have have superior intelligence. <br>
 <br>
After one or two generations Orientals in the United States tend to make more money than whites because they tend to be more intelligent. </p>

		<p>The Intriguing Parable of Blondeblueeyedia:</p>
<p>Actually, there is no/has never been any serious or substantive controversy at all about whether blacks have lower intelligence than whites.</p>
<p>They do, and it is too well-documented to be open to discussion. </p>
<p>The controversy is about whether low black cognitive ability is caused by genes or environment or both.</p>
<p>The reason why &#8220;race fantasists&#8221; (egalitarians) try to ban research into racial difference is simple:</p>
<p>they know just as well as any Amren subscriber what the results of such research are bound to be.</p>
<p>Once definitive genetic evidence has been gathered and published, it will begin to filter into the mainstream media.</p>
<p>The talking heads will contort their brains doing damage control, but eventually, the gist of it will get through to the mainstream:</p>
<p>blacks have evolved a very different psychology than whites, and are much lower in cognitive ability on average.</p>
<p>Blacks may be lower in average intelligence than whites, they may be emotionally immature, prone to violence, selfish, and impulsive, but they&rsquo;re still human beings, they are still Americans, and they still have rights.</p>
<p>We have wasted a century during which the problems of blacks might have an addressed in a pragmatic and realistic fashion.</p>
<p>One approach might have been to keep the immigration of low IQ Third Worlders such as Mexican peasants to a minimum:</p>
<p>their presence has made the blacks an utterly superfluous labor force, and this has been disastrous for them.</p>
<p>Just imagine a white ethnicity - let&rsquo;s call them the natives of a small Baltic nation known as &#8220;Blondeblueeyedia.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Blondeblueeyedians have platinum blonde hair, porcelain white skin, blazing blue eyes, are handsome and well proportioned.<br>
Unfortunately, there are also low in intelligence, high in testosterone, high in impulsivity, high in selfishness and narcissism. </p>
<p>Liberals and progressives would know how to deal with such a group.</p>
<p>Asson as skin color enters the picture, everyone&rsquo;s brains seem to go completely haywire.</p>
<p>Present my Blondeblueeyedia scenario to progressives and ask them to work out a plan for this particular population.</p>
<p>Once they have presented to you with something reasonable, involving, for example lots of job and parent training, strict policing, simple, inflexible easily understandable, and clear, carrot and stick incentives and disincentives, respond with:</p>
<p>&#8220;excellent, you just presented me with a plan for dealing with blacks.&#8221;</p>

Anyone who finds impressive evidence that intelligence is primarily determined by genes, and that those genes differ between the races is considered to be a racist by definition, and consequently rejected. </p>

		<p>The correlation between height and IQ among twins, I find it hard to believe. </p>
<p>In the general population, I suppose something like that :<br>
 Clever men become rich, and rich men mate tall girls. <br>
So, tall children are rather clever. </p>
<p>In a family <br>
Each brother has one fourth of his genes which come from one of his grand-parents. If one of the grand-parent is tall and clever, and the other small and unintelligent, for to have the correlation it is necessary that the same gene controls height and intelligence, or that when one of these genes is transmitted to the offspring, the other is transmitted, too. That latter, one does not see why natural selection would have created that association between these genes. The former, it is hard to believe. <br>

		<p>Jupiter7, you are entitled to your opinion, but why attack everyone else for not sharing it? Plenty of us here do not care for white nationalism; we are just here to discuss HBD. You seem to assume that anyone knowledgeable in HBD must agree with white nationalism OR ELSE. This is like assuming that anyone knowledgeable in economics must agree with free-market capitalism, or that anyone knowledgeable in theology must agree with Christian fundamentalism. This is patently false; world-class economists are as divided on what economic system they prefer as laymen are, and world-class theologians are as divided on religion as laymen are.</p>
<p>There is no equivalence between academics and politics. Academics informs us, politics is how we respond to the information. You can attack people who choose to willfully deny facts, but you cannot attack people who, armed with the same facts as yourself, advocate a different response. White nationalism is just one response out of many, and not even a particularly sensible one. As John Engelman says: &#8220;The future does not belong to any one race. It belongs to individuals of all races who have have superior intelligence.&#8221; I happen to find this much more sensible.</p>

<p>WRONG, currently, and for some time now, Asians get many advantages over whites, because they are NOT white.  Their tendency to be disciplined and work hard is given a super boost in America due to AA and Protected Groups, as well as accelerated immigration programs and employers who have bought into the myth of Oriental superiority so much that they won&rsquo;t hire any engineers but Asians.  I know, I have an old friend who was an engineer for several decades in Silicon Valley fired in favor of a H1B Asian.  Now he can&rsquo;t find a job anywhere.  He was a Ten Topper in High School, one of the first people I ever heard of working on computer innovation in the early 70s, and his big problem is that he is WHITE.</p>

		<p>Why are discussions about race, IQ and genes &#8220;100 percent irrelevant to the Native Born White American revolt against race-replacement?&#8221; <br>
They are very relevant because if race differences are only skin-deep, confined only to physical features, than what&rsquo;s the problem with all the races just mongrelizing and producing one big brown humanity? It would only mean the loss of unique physical traits like blond hair and colored irises that are unique to Europeans. This new brown race would still be able to sustain and improve upon the high levels of civilzation whites in the West have created. Acting like race differnces in behavior are irrelevant, one worlders will continue to say that white nationlists and their sympathizers are just crazed bigots who have no logical justification for their fears. Liberals like to carp about how silly it is for anyone to care about a person&rsquo;s &#8220;skin-color.&#8221; But it is the behavioral and psychological differnces between racial groups, and not some skin color fetish, that justify our objections to displacement. Although in end, the globalists could seize on the findings about the higher-than-average IQs of Oreintals to justify their goal of white erradication by means of both yellow immigration and miscegenation with Orientals.  That much I&rsquo;ll concede. </p>

<p>You are entitiled to your racial preferences. But your racial preferences ar not the racial preferences of the vast majority of Native Born White Americans who come to this website. And your racial preference is not the racial preference of American Renaissance.</p>
<p>When  America was 90 percent Native Born White American and when NASA was 99 percent Native Born White American, America put 12 Alpha Native Born White American Males on the Moon. How did Native Born White Americans ever manage to survive when there so few Asians in our America? Quite well thank you. Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to commit racial suicide within the borders of America because the alien Asian presence in America demands it.</p>
<p>Asians in our America harbor malignant intent towards the Native Born White American Majority&hellip;the evidence for this fact is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Bring back the Chinese Exclusion Act&hellip;it was a wonderfull piece of 19th century legislation.</p>
