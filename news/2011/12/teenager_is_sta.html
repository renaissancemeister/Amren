<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police and paramedics try in vain to save a teenager stabbed to death amid crowds of Boxing Day sales shoppers yesterday.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old  &mdash;  named locally today as Seydou Diarrassouba  &mdash;  is said to have been killed after a fight erupted between rival gangs over which trainers to steal from a sportswear shop in London&rsquo;s jam-packed Oxford Street.</p>
<p>Cops recovered several weapons including a flick knife from the scene. Eleven suspects were held.</p>
<p>One witness told how a feral gang shoved parents and children aside as they chased down the terrified victim before murdering him in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Frightened families took refuge in shops as he collapsed in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>And the witness  &mdash;  a woman shopping with her husband and baby daughter  &mdash;  said: &#8220;I hope that one day I will forget his eyes and the monsters who were chasing him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The savagery erupted at lunchtime as tens of thousands of Boxing Day bargain hunters thronged London&rsquo;s Oxford Street.</p>
<p>There were claims that two rival gangs from South London had argued over which designer trainers they aimed to steal from a branch of Foot Locker.</p>
<p>The murder follows violent struggles in the US between shoppers battling to buy pairs of Nike&rsquo;s new Air Jordan basketball-style trainers, though the limited edition shoes are not thought to be available here yet.</p>
<p>Another lad aged 21 was stabbed in the thigh by three attackers nearly five hours after the Foot Locker murder outside the nearby Nike Town store.</p>
<p>A pile of blood-soaked clothes was left on the ground there along with what looked like a pair of brand-new Nike Air trainers.</p>
<p>Police who arrested two suspects could not make a &#8220;firm&#8221; link between the two stabbings. But they said: &#8220;There are similar circumstances, youths possibly from the South London area.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gangs in the Foot Locker incident clashed outside the shop before a fight broke out inside.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old, named by pals under his street name Seydou Nutz, made a run for it chased by at least seven young thugs.</p>
<p>The woman witness  &mdash;  a 32-year-old admin assistant too scared to be named  &mdash;  said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was near Foot Locker when all hell broke loose. Someone pushed me from behind and darted past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I swung round and could see seven people chasing this lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will remember the faces of these monsters all my life, though some were part-covered by hoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were desperate to get hold of him and were screaming and shouting, pushing people out of their way. One leapt up as he ran to try to almost jump through the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lad being chased sprinted into Foot Locker. He looked absolutely terrified. His face was etched with desperation to escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;While he was in the shop something obviously spooked him as he came out again. Maybe he couldn&rsquo;t pass the crowds.</p>
<p>&#8220;As he came out I knew they were going to catch him. One of the men going after him looked so aggressive and angry. All they wanted to do was get him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hid inside Boots and when we went out there was this crowd around him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A stall-holder selling fruit and veg nearby said: &#8220;The man was stabbed straight into his stomach. The blade was very long  &mdash;  it was a big knife. Everyone was so shocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police had already been called by the time the teenager was knifed. Armed cops rushed to the scene and were joined by paramedics who made a desperate  &mdash;  but vain  &mdash;  attempt to revive him.</p>
<p>A teacher shopping with her young niece said: &#8220;They were trying to bring him back to life and there was a friend holding his hand. When they told his friend he wasn&rsquo;t going to make it he just dropped the hand and started screaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another witness said: &#8220;After a while they put a cover on his body.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten suspects aged in their late teens or early 20s were arrested nearby.</p>
<p>A number of weapons including a flick knife were recovered at the scene, which was cordoned off from the hordes of shoppers.</p>
<p>A section of Oxford Street was closed and branches of Boots and Debenhams were forced to shut, costing them dearly.</p>
<p>Inquiry chief Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dunne, of the Metropolitan Police&rsquo;s Homicide Command, said the murder had taken place at the &#8220;busiest place in the United Kingdom on the busiest shopping day&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;It has therefore been difficult for us to piece together what happened and to clear this area.</p>
<p>&#8220;The flipside is we have probably more witnesses than usual. And I&rsquo;m looking forward to them speaking to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victim is thought to be from Tooting and may be Somali. News of his murder spread swiftly across social networking websites, prompting a string of despairing posts.</p>
<p>Rapper and actor Bashy, 26, said: &#8220;I heard someone has been stabbed &amp; killed up Oxford Street. What&rsquo;s wrong with these p*****? Lil kids &amp; families are up there too. Disgusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pal of the dead lad going by the name of &#8220;Ozzmosis_Jones&#8221; wrote: &#8220;R.I.P. Seydou Nutz. Gone too soon ma bruddah.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Some call it stereotyping, other would point out that these crimes are most usually from a particular group.  This is not an economic crime, or one borne of the legacy of slavery as we default to here in the US.  These are thugs with no empathy for others beyond their immediate wants.</p>

		<p>Well Brits. For years you called us racists but I&rsquo;m happy that you now have had an Epiphany vis a vis the joys of primitive diversity. We&rsquo;ve been enduring it for years.<br>
I take no pleasure in your misfortune. Hopefully you and we Americans can get our heads together to find a way to resolve this problem.</p>

		<p>For the benefit of readers who do not reside in the UK or know London:</p>
<p>The perimeter of London is defined by a motorway [freeway, expressway, beltway] the M25 which is about 120 miles in length. Within this perimeter approximately 8 million people live. It has been estimated that numbers equivalent to the D Day invasion commute in and out of the city each day. The River Thames flows through the city from east to west and creates the divide of North London and South London.</p>
<p>Oxford Street is the main middle class shopping street on the north side of the river. All the major department stores in the country have their flagship store and executive head quarters here. As the piece says it is probably the busiest shopping precinct in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;South London&#8221; is the euphemism being used to collectively identify the inner city black neighbourhoods which are strung along the south side of the river - Peckham, Brixton, Tooting etc. They are about 1 mile back from the prime river front properties and tourist areas. As you head further south into South London and start approaching the M25 you enter middle class white suburbia.</p>
<p>So reading &#8220;the code&#8221; (before seeing the photo) - name of deceased and origin of his location - it was clear to me the victim was black and had been set upon by a pack of wolves from his own community. &#8220;Lad and youth&#8221; is what Americans would probably call teens.</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman witness &mdash; a 32-year-old admin assistant too scared to be named&#8221;<br>
My guess is she is white</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hid inside Boots&#8221;</p>
<p>Boots is the biggest drug store chain who have outlets in every town across the country</p>
<p>&#8220;branches of Boots and Debenhams were forced to shut,&#8221;</p>
<p>Debenhams is a major department store chain found throughout the country</p>
<p>The moral of this story is just how brazen and stupid they are, plus how pathetic their value system is. To kill for a pair of sneakers?</p>
<p>To think that they could get away with such a crime in broad daylight with so many witnesses present, and police nearby [ the area is patrolled by many police officers] is clearly indicative of the -70 IQ roaming free in the concrete jungle. </p>

<p>Many details of the cultural enrichment embodied in the gangster victim and his associates. Extra enrichment bonus - he was nominally, at least, Muslim. </p>
<p>From the Mail Online.<br>
The coverage is good with photos and 2 videos:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/6r8235l" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/6r8235l</a></p>
<p>Making a gun salute with his fingers, this is the teenager stabbed to death in front of Boxing Day shoppers after a feud between rival gangs erupted in London&rsquo;s West End.</p>
<p>Seydou Diarrassouba, 18, was knifed in the heart after a fight broke out  in a trainer store as the two groups were on a shoplifting spree on a packed Oxford Street.</p>
<p>The victim was a member of the notorious London street gang ABM, which stands for �?All &rsquo;Bout Money&rsquo;, and the killer was believed to have been involved with the rival 031 Bloods. Territorial clashes between the two South London gangs have claimed several lives since 2007.</p>
<p>On YouTube, the victim appears  in a homemade rap video in which he talks about guns and killing (see below). A known gangster, he was facing trial over charges of robbery and assault by beating in relation to an alleged attack in September.</p>
<p>On Boxing Day he is believed to have left his home on a council estate in Mitcham, South London, with other members of ABM with the intention of using the sales crush as cover for shoplifting.</p>
<p>But the gang ran into their rivals and violence that is usually restricted to deprived areas of London boiled over in front of crowds of shoppers, tourists and families. Sportswear store Foot Locker became the battleground when the  college student was knifed through the heart before staggering outside and collapsing in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>He died at the scene at around 1.45pm, the latest victim of London&rsquo;s senseless gang violence.</p>
<p>Just hours later, a second man aged 21 was stabbed in the leg on the same street in what is believed to be a separate and unrelated attack.</p>
<p>Born in Merton, south London, in 1993 to Muslim parents who came to Britain from the Ivory Coast in West Africa, he was the youngest of three.</p>
<p>Friends said Diarrassouba was one of the �?bright kids&rsquo; at Rutlish High School in Merton, before attending South Thames College. His family, who live in a rundown tower-block on the outskirts of Mitcham, south London, were last night too devastated to speak.</p>
<p>But a series of disturbing images and videos seen by  the Daily Mail reveal the  teenager glorifying violence and smoking what appears to be a �?blunt&rsquo; – slang for a rolled up cigarette containing cannabis.</p>
<p>Known by the nicknames �?Nutz&rsquo; and �?TunaRaw&rsquo;, he was an active gang member for at least two years.</p>
<p>Many teenagers who lived near him would avoid him, aware he was part of the ABM gang and could be armed.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, one  teenager said he had witnessed Diarrassouba and a fellow  gang member attack another group of boys at a house  party in Croydon, simply because they were from an opposing faction.</p>
<p>The three victims of the assault were left with bloodied lips and bruised faces.</p>
<p>One associate said: �?He may well pretend to be an angel at home, but he&rsquo;s hardly going to go home and threaten his mother. Seydou was a completely different person when he was with his friends, but that&rsquo;s gang life.</p>
<p>�?Around other members  he was a bubbly character,  but not when he came across his enemies. That was a  different story.</p>
<p>�?You certainly couldn&rsquo;t trust him. He had a cold and ruthless side to him, and could turn on you in an instant if you were not one of his own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eleven people - including a boy of 16 - have been arrested in connection with the murder, but police are still trying to trace a number of those involved in the attack.</p>

		<p>Mitcham, the area he lived in has long been a fairly unsalubrious place.T raditionally it was associated with Gypsies, but has increasingly come to resemble an African village (with the odd Afghan warlord or two thrown in ) since the Blair putsch of 1997. It sits on the same Tramline that Emma West dared to speak out on.</p>

<p><br>
 I very much doubt Jordan could possibly care less about this. He has his mega-fortune, lives in some huge mega-mansion and probably hasn&rsquo;t been to a &#8216;hood&rsquo; in years. First thing a black does when he acquires money and success (usually from athletics and entertainment, the only areas they do well in) is to move as far away from other blacks as they can. </p>

		<p>When this was first reported the BBC made no mention of the name or race of the victim or perps, although given the merchandise I felt sure that blacks were involved. </p>
<p>Within hours the BBC reported another murder - of an Indian student.  This time the BBC announcer said &#8220;the police are looking for a white man&#8221; who was seen driving away from the scene.  Since then the media has deluged us with sentimental guff grieving the loss of a &#8220;highly promising student scientist&#8221;. <br>

When this was first reported the BBC made no mention of the name or race of the victim or perps, although given the merchandise I felt sure that blacks were involved.</p>
<p>Within hours the BBC reported another murder - of an Indian student. This time the BBC announcer said &ldquo;the police are looking for a white man&rdquo; who was seen driving away from the scene. Since then the media has deluged us with sentimental guff grieving the loss of a &ldquo;highly promising student scientist&rdquo;. </p>
<p>No further comment necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crime mentioned above has now been described as a a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, and several White youths have been arrested.  BUT, according to witnesses, there were no &#8220;racial&#8221; threats or abuse prior to the shooting.</p>
<p>As for the Oxford Street murder, this sort of thing happens in the &#8220;hood&#8221;, everyday, but it is now happening more and more regularly in broad daylight, in front of crowds of witnesses, in more middle and upper class areas.  When the victims and perps are named, they are - almost without exception - of West African origin.    </p>
