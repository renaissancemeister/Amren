<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Ben [Shapiro] has provided another short clip exclusively to Townhall, this time featuring an interview he conducted with John Langley, the creator of the long-running FOX program, COPS. Langley says he&rsquo;s irked by some media critics who accuse the show of perpetuating stereotypes about &#8220;people of color&#8221; by depicting a disproportionate percentage of minority suspects. Au Contraire, Langley protests, he intentionally shows an inordinate number of white suspects in order to side-step the facts. &#8220;I show more white people than, statistically, what the truth is.&#8221; {snip}</p>

<p>&#8220;C.O.P.S.&#8221; actually shows the nature of routine police calls as well as any show can.  I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the show for years.  That said, this revelation is a real shame.  It shows most of the focus, deliberately, is on domestic disputes between white people   &mdash;   and minor disputes at that.  Then again, I long have suspected as much.</p>

		<p>Smoking gun.  I&rsquo;ve always suspected that &#8220;COPS&#8221; deliberately shows too many white &#8220;criminals,&#8221; i.e. bloodied up shirtless drunks who got in fights with their wives or girlfriends, in order to keep the PC hounds at bay. </p>
<p>Similarly, I think COPS&rsquo;s stablemate on Fox Saturday nights, &#8220;America&rsquo;s Most Wanted&#8221; (soon to end), has done the same thing.  Something about John Walsh has always bugged me, and I have had the feeling for some time that it was his intention all along to ride his dead son&rsquo;s body to a small fortune.  But what clinched it for me was that in recent years, Walsh has taken to denouncing &#8220;white racists&#8221; and &#8220;right wing extremists,&#8221; on AMW, profiling a &#8220;dastardly crime&#8221; wherein a supposed Kentucky militia member yelled at a cop who pulled him over a bit too loudly for the cop&rsquo;s personal liking.  Walsh made this guy out almost to be the second coming of Hitler, using the R-word, the &#8220;Anti-S&#8221; word, and all the usual words, as many times as he could, when this person might have not held such attitudes   &mdash;   it has actually been my experience with militia types in St. Louis that they&rsquo;re &#8220;diversity lovers,&#8221; to use a charitable term   &mdash;   They would slobber like a dumb thirsty puppy for someone like Allen West.  </p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff you think you have to do while most of your show&rsquo;s profiles include black murderers, Hispanic murderers and other serious NAM ne&rsquo;er-do-wells   &mdash;   Gotta keep the civil rights hounds at bay.  Wouldn&rsquo;t want the NAACP to accuse you of racism, right?  That would be worse than a death by a thousand knife cuts.  (Actually, it wouldn&rsquo;t, but we&rsquo;ll make that our little secret).</p>

		<p>Shapiro is obviously a racist! Rather than 40% black perpetrators, it should have been 0% black perpetrators! Everyone knows that.</p>
<p>Oh, and the law enforcement officers should have been shown as 100% black. </p>
<p>&hellip;All right, maybe they could throw in a couple of really dumb whites. But only if the whites make a lot of mistakes and have to be constantly bailed out by their black colleagues.</p>

<p>I totally agree. I quit watching COPS and AMW quite awhile ago because for the very reasons you stated. I always wondered why they show so much White crime when I KNEW (since the net) that minorities are the real criminals by numbers alone.</p>
<p>As for Walsh, I can&rsquo;t stand that man. He acts like he is Numero Uno and all this fame has gone to his head. Of course he would call a White guy a racist, White Supremacist, etc. because he is just like all the rest in our media. TRAITORS, one and all, to our race. He knows where his big check is coming from.</p>

		<p>Also note that on the same network the IQ-based (racist) &lsquo;Jeopardy&rsquo; game show is paired with the common ownership &lsquo;Wheel of Fortune&rsquo; game show in back-to-back slots. Observe that the final &lsquo;Spin-of-the-Wheel&rsquo;, controlled by staff, is typically a game-changer when the person of color is behind, and is a smaller value when the person of color is in the lead.</p>
<p>Lawyers take note. The statistical analysis of these spins, sorted by the race of leader, might form the basis of a very entertaining class-action law suit.<br>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched an episode of COPS in probably 15 years.  I always thought it over-emphasized white trash types.  If you want realism nowadays watch &#8220;The First 48&#8221; on A&E.;  The show follows the first 48 hours of homicide investigations and is very entertaining.  I would guess that the victim and suspect rate of blacks on this show is around 90 percent.  Almost every homicide fits into 2 categories.  Grudges and robberies involving drugs.  Unlike Law and Order there are no elaborate storylines involving scheming whites who play mastermind.  </p>

<p>I supposed what bugged me about John Walsh, before he started in on his PC kick, is that he seemed to have the attitude that he and only he was against violent crime, nobody else had the sense enough to be against violent crime, and the only way we would ever know that violent crime is wrong is to watch him profile unapprehended violent criminals and his pontifications about how violent crime is wrong an hour every week.  It is his faux-holier than thou attitude that rubbed me the wrong way, at least before all his PC started.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like election season   &mdash;   Every second October, every politician or wannabe politician you know keeps telling us they&rsquo;re for education and health care.  As if that&rsquo;s such a brave political stand, putting your neck on the line and joining the fringe 99.99999% constituency that is for education and health care.  Start telling us about things that 90% of sane normal white people are for but only 1% of the ruling class is for   &mdash;   stopping black and Hispanic crime, stopping racial dispossession of whites.  Only then will I consider these pols truly to be courageous.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, I blogged about &#8220;The First 48&#8221; a few days ago, (first time I saw it, and I&rsquo;m going to make it a regular TV appointment), reiterating a conclusion that might not make me the most popular AR poster, especially among the members of a certain single-issue constituency:</p>

		<p>Since I support the view that reenactments cannot, by definition, be accurate to the actual event and am more than a little gunshy of &#8216;The Running Man&rsquo; psychology these shows can falsely imbue in people, I admit I don&rsquo;t watch a lot of crime docudramas.</p>
<p>However; it seems to me that most whites do not want to see black crime in any depth because it is often vulgar, extreme and essentially not understandable for it&rsquo;s sheer brutality and irrational justifications.  i.e.  It scares us to think of what lies in our midst.</p>
<p>As with every other demographically gamed statistic, Cop shows will follow what looks like high viewer density trends.  Funny that we are more comfortable seeing whites misbehave&hellip;</p>

		<p>Nothing beats the US DOJ/US DOT in terms of skewed racial/ethnic/gender bias in crime fighting propaganda. (and this ad campaign started in the Bush administration) </p>
<p>I am referring to a TV publicity campaign against drunk drivers that the Feds started running circa 2008. In that 60 second TV spot, about 4 or 5 traffic stops are depicted showing a pulled car with a beer like liquid filling the passenger compartment and some clueless under the yellow liquid drunk as the pulling officer asks: &#8220;Sir, have you been drinking tonight?&#8221; </p>
<p>All of the drunk drivers in this ad campaign were 22-50 year old white men.</p>

		<p>My career carrying a badge started just about the same time as COPS. The show as it is highlights much of what my job entails, with the exciting parts displayed and the boring parts on the editing room floor.</p>
<p>I have always believed that there was a racial handicapping in the show, putting more white suspects in an episode than statistics reveal. It has been my near daily experience that in the course of my day that the minority percentage of blacks in my area are the majority of my calls for service and the majority of arrests. </p>
<p>What I am waiting for is the outrage over The First 48, as others have commented, as well as the &#8220;Stupidest Criminals Caught on Tape&#8221; and such, where nearly all the crimes/violence/stupidity is by blacks. They make efforts to conceal the bad guys faces (God knows why), but watch them sometime, see if you notice the same things. Out of ten stories, 5-7 are blacks doing something stupid or violent. I can only hope others are noting this and becoming more aware. </p>

		<p>Well, I know I&rsquo;m shocked.</p>
<p>I was watching a documentary on very young criminals this week on a cable channel. The show featured, maybe, a half dozen teeny-boppers who had committed horrendous crimes. </p>
<p>All of the criminal kids featured on the show were White. </p>
<p>What I find particularly bothersome is that such brainwashing techniques actually work. </p>

		<p>The entire entertainment industry, mainstream media, academia, governments everywhere, the police departments, on and on and on, skew the facts and figures to favor blacks.  Part of it is because they don&rsquo;t want them to riot; part of it is because they believe that eventually blacks will somehow miraculously integrate into the mainstream; part of it is because these same kinds of people believe they are doing their part to keep the racial situation down by lying about everything.</p>
<p>Hollywood, with its opposite-of-reality presentations probably generally believes that changing the perception of blacks in the minds of the non-black population, as stupid, lazy, and without abilities of any importance, will cause the miracle to occur.  The only problem with that is that reality itself gives everyone another stark example of what these liars and distorters try to promote.</p>
<p>Right now the academians are responsible for setting loose unqualified blacks as pharmacists, doctors and other professional people, by generously awarding them unearned grades and diplomas.  This is going to prove fatal for many innocent people just so the black population can once again be catered to.</p>
<p>This is a dysfunctional empire that can&rsquo;t last much longer in its present form.</p>

		<p>Well, just remember that the television is the state&rsquo;s one-way communication system; particularly the government stations. The ABC here in Australia is a blatant propaganda tool to brainwash you and turn you into a mindless p.c zombie that is too scared to have an opinion that isn&rsquo;t state-sanctioned.</p>

He pays special &#8220;attention&#8221; to the black contestants. It is to the point that I dread seeing any black on those two shows and praying they lose. Makes me wonder if they &#8220;knew&#8221; the answers beforehand.</p>

<p>Oh, and the law enforcement officers should have been shown as 100% black. &hellip;All right, maybe they could throw in a couple of really dumb whites. But only if the whites make a lot of mistakes and have to be constantly bailed out by their black colleagues.</p>

<p>As far as John Walsh goes - I grew up in Hollywood, Florida and was a kid when his son was kidnapped and murdered. We shopped at the Hollywood Fashion Center Mall just like they did. John tried to sue Sears and make a few bucks out of the fact that his kid was snatched from there while mommy wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. Yeah, it is the store&rsquo;s fault, alright. I don&rsquo;t think he was successful in his cash-hunt.</p>
