<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If we&rsquo;re going to have a conversation about race, we should include violent black mobs in the list of conversation topics. After all, recent mob violence is the closest our nation has come to widespread racial strife in over 50 years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, a mob of black youths in Philadelphia went about chanting the phrase &#8220;black boys,&#8221; beating mostly on whites, and attacking businesses. The same kind of racial mob violence has occurred in Las Vegas, and just last week in New York City. Few are paying attention, and liberal elites are largely silent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Time and again over the last few years, mobs of black youths attacked mostly white victims in Philadelphia. There were at least 6 such mob scenes in Philadelphia during 2009 and 2010. These black mob attacks, euphemistically named &#8220;flash mobs,&#8221; have not received anything close to the attention they deserve. In one attack, a mob of blacks beat a young white woman senseless  &mdash;  a mob that had chanted &#8220;black boys&#8221; and &#8220;burn the city,&#8221; according to the New York Times. {snip} Some reporting has, amazingly, made the simple observation about the racial make-up of these mobs: that they are &#8220;mostly African American.&#8221;</p>
<p>These horrible mob attacks must be viewed in the larger context of interracial violence in America. Department of Justice statistics show that 33% of white murder victims are killed by a non-white while only 8% of black murder victims are killed by a non-black. Even greater disparities exist in violent crime and robbery. The disparity in interracial crime is certainly indicative of some form of extremism, racial hostility, or selective targeting. The mobs reflect something worse: organized and widespread anti-white ethnic violence.</p>
<p>Mobs of black youths have taken to randomly attacking pedestrians and businesses. This problem is nightmarish in its implications: a subset of the population has no self-control, was not raised to control violent impulses, and evidently gets pleasure out of hurting other people  &mdash;  particularly people of other races. This type of person usually has done nothing to create anything of value, but rather destroys for pleasure. They organize using social media, and their goal is mayhem. They have been coddled and socialized by the welfare state and public education system. With an aggressive sense of entitlement, and no regard for others, they will predictably become more violent. The mobs reflect an undesirable character type, and the vast majority of those in &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; are of the same race.</p>
<p>Now, the cultural enrichment of &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; is spreading to New York City. In Greenwich Village last week, security video captured &#8220;a group of youths climbing on counters, throwing chairs and throwing tables in a violent attack on workers&#8221; at a Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts. {snip} Watching the video, one is struck by the extraordinarily callous behavior of the teens, who were all black  &mdash;  a fact not mentioned in any of the reporting about that attack. Unlike the case with many acts of violence, certain youths are evidently becoming more and more comfortable with public, organized group violence. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet, the racial aspect of the &#8220;flash mob&#8221; phenomenon is not seriously covered in the mainstream media. This is proof of systematic racial bias in reporting, and a failure of leadership across the board in our society. The mainstream media is in effect using a filtering process that downplays violence by blacks against whites. {snip}</p>
<p>The media filtering process undermines society&rsquo;s interest in safety. When the majority ethnic group is being attacked in potentially catastrophic racial group violence, the press has a duty to report the underlying facts. Flash mobs are the closest our nation has come to widespread racial strife in over 50 years. Flash mobs, if unaddressed, will evolve into further racist attacks against whites. {snip} Moreover, if our legal, political, and academic leadership had more intellectual and moral integrity, the &#8220;flash mob&#8221; would be taken as seriously as &#8220;hate speech,&#8221; racial profiling, and other non-violent offenses against minority feelings.</p>

		<p>The liberal call for &#8220;a dialogue on race&#8221; is as hypocritical as the liberal practice of advocating forced school bussing while sending their children to white private schools. Liberals have done everything to suppress a candid discussion on black social pathology.  </p>

<p>I was reading some of the comments on the American Thinker article page and I notice that a lot of comments indicate that a lot of people in this country recognize we do have a problem with Black on White crime. At least many White Americans are finally seeing the truth.</p>

		<p>The NYT mentioned race regarding black-on-white violence. Bit by bit the censors edifice is cracking, the liberal taboos are failing. Like any flood, the tide of truth will work its way through the walls of silence, cracks will become fissures, and at last, the walls will crumble.</p>

<p>I agree. But what are all the lamestream conservatives and neo-cons at American Stinker going to do to see that the problem is addressed?  They will probably wholeheartedly endorse a Republican for President who will make sure the problem doesn&rsquo;t get solved.  That&rsquo;s because they slobber all over past Republican Presidents who exacerbated or ignored the problem.</p>

<p>No kidding?  That&rsquo;s obvious to everybody but the liberals.  </p>
<p>The reason the black on white attacks are getting so numerous is due to the excuses made for them by the government, the press, and the police.  And when black violence isn&rsquo;t being excused by these same self-appointed elites their being ignored or played down.</p>
<p>A rage is building among the sedentary white couch potatoes who are finding it difficult to ignore the threat, because it&rsquo;s getting a bit closer to home. </p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s going to take a LOT more of the same or one huge atrocity to get whites up and ready to fight.  </p>

		<p>It would not be hard to stop the flash mobs.  The real problem will be dealing with the outrage expressed by the black community, its supporters and appeasers, which is sure to follow.  Will we all wilt when the the preachers start to read the Sermon on the Mount to us, when the political classes try to bring us all together so we can move forward as one nation?</p>

		<p>One of my facebook &#8216;friends&rsquo; linked directly to the American Thinker article and I was surprised and happy to see this issue start to gain some traction on more mainstream sites (albeit AT is decidedly right leaning).</p>
<p>I read through every comment and they are really no different than what one sees here, however I think when easing the general public into the race discussion it has to be done slowly and with finesse. Many white people who&rsquo;ve been conditioned to hate themselves and believe all the liberal lies will run for the hills as soon as they see a post about &#8216;taking up arms&rsquo;, or discussing the IQ differences between the races. </p>
<p>Most conservative whites are spot on with their critique of the general malaise that decades of leftist policies have bestowed on us, but are hesitant to make the connection between those policies and black failure   &mdash;  or the disastrous illegal immigration problem via the 1964 Immigration Act.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times that I&rsquo;ve seen well produced videos or well written articles about the &#8216;conversation on race&rsquo; that I would love to tweet or post but I don&rsquo;t because some of the comments make references to Hitler or write &#8216;Seig Heil&rsquo;. Most people would think that agreeing with the article meant they were now the media contrived image of a skinhead with a baseball bat in his hand.</p>
<p>If everyone uses measured tones and attempt to have a productive dialogue about the race problems without getting involved in online arguing over nonsense, the message would spread and be embraced much easier. My two cents.</p>

		<p>You know this black mob violence phenomenon is getting bad when even publications like The American Thinker start noticing it. This is especially significant considering that Barack Hussein Obama was supposed to serve as this wonderful &#8220;role model&#8221; for blacks, but his election has only served to make things worse. In fact, fifty years of liberal policies have only made things worse, but of course the liberals never change their theories.</p>

<p>The only things I have to disagree with is that this is some new thing because of Obama.  Black anti-white mob violence has been continual in America since the 1960&rsquo;s.  Remember the Seattle and Cincinnati riots that happened around 10 years ago.  </p>

		<p>A certain part of the black population preaches the killing of whites as part of their dogma.  It is not nice and it is usually kept hidden as a matter of official police by the police at least in Calif to prevent open race war from evolving if the white population of the state was made aware of reality.  white folk are kept ignorant of reality but obviously the black criminals are fully aware of things since they do the crimes.  Read for yourself the teachings of Malcolm X and his followers over time and you will see race hate at its finest.  the Zebra killers of San Francisco were a perfect example of this hate.  Kill five white people and get the title of &#8220;Death Angel&#8221;  Kids gave the highest points.  It is sick and it is extremely evil but it is unfortunately reality.  Such things must be faced and brought out into the open  This great evil has to be stopped as the white race is not a punching bag for the frustrations of other races to be vented on a whim.</p>

		<p>You can bet the liberals know about all this because they either make every effort to cover it up, or they attempt to ruin the credibility of any prominent person who points it out.  Take the Memorial Day weekend, for example.  I have an elderly relative who watches cable news almost constantly.  As far as he knows, not one story about all the black mob violence made it onto these venues.  There had to be an intentional coverup, or else one or two of these events would have been mentioned.  Even the fact that a cop was killed in Miami and a 1000-person flash mob occurred in Boston was deemed not newsworthy.  The only thing my relative heard about was the black &#8220;poet&#8221; murdered in Miami, and that was probably just because the man was black.  There was no mention in the story of widespread black misbehavior (to put it mildly!) or that the shooting was a driveby (read: black killer).  </p>

		<p>How will whites be treated when we&rsquo;re 20% of the population? This is where we&rsquo;re headed. Do the math yourself. We&rsquo;re dropping by 1/2 of 1% per year. The following is an approximation, but it&rsquo;s amazing accurate  &mdash;  </p>
<p>1960- America 90% white (&#8220;Mayberry USA&#8221;)<br>
1970-         85% white<br>
1980-         80% white (Our last conservative president)<br>
1990-         75% white<br>
2000-         70& white<br>
2010-         65% white</p>
<p>The following is an extrapolation but will occur unless something halts the trend  &mdash;  </p>
<p>2020-         60& white (No more white presidents after this)<br>
2030-         55% white<br>
2040-         50% white (Whites become a minority in the U.S.)<br>
2050-         45% white<br>
2060-         40% white<br>
2070-         35% white (Hispanics are the largest ethnic group)<br>
2080-         30% white<br>
2090-         25% white<br>
2100-         20% white </p>
<p>Extrapolate this to 2140 and whites are essentially extinct.</p>
<p>As I was telling my 16-year-old niece, who wants to go to college and get a high-paying job  &mdash;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Oh? So you can make a lot of money, die, and leave it to the Mexicans?&#8221;</p>

		<p>The so-called &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; will swell and become much more violent and frequent when the welfare checks start to shrink or disappear altogether. </p>
<p>The violence will increase when/if Obama gets re-elected; the election of Obama has given the flash-mob participants an increased sense of entitlement. They can sense that Holder (&#8220;my people&#8221;) and Obama give them a kind of cache or &#8220;right&#8221; to more openly express their rage at the System which, of course, they blame for all their problems, like low IQ, slothfulness, anti-social behavior, etc.</p>
<p>These mobs are, of course, a more visible aspect of the long-running low intensity war that the blacks have been waging against the Whites. It is now breaking out into the open, and will surely escalate as the economy continues to crumble. </p>
<p>Brace for more to come.</p>

<p>If this is happening when we White people are a majority, can you imagine how we will be treated when we are in a minority?&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellent observation, Miss Whitey.  I was at a backyard barbecue over the Memorial Day weekend, and was having a conversation with a fellow white guy - and the increase in black on white violent crime came up, and then this lead to the topic of massive non-white, third world immigration in America.   I made the comment that there is absolutely NOTHING positive or beneficial about whites being reduced to a minority inside the nation that was bequeathed to them, and which was built by their 100 percent White European ancestors.  I flatly stated that whites, as a group, should oppose being reduced to a minority by any and all means necessary.  </p>
<p>Know what the reaction was of the white guy to whom I was speaking?   He flexes his bicep and said that he would put the hammer down on any minority who tried to pull anything with him, and if that wasn&rsquo;t sufficient, then he&rsquo;d go to his private collection of firearms.  Well, I was stunned by the sheer stupidity of such a response.   </p>
<p>I then patiently explained to this guy that once whites are reduced to a numerical minority, then the new non-white majority would most certainly vote for politicians and support legislation that would make it illegal for private citizens to own or possess firearms, even for self-protection.   Whitey WILL be DISARMED and that is a guaranteed consequence of minority status.     Plus, even more draconian, anti-freedom oriented laws would be passed - such as the ADL&rsquo;s long-coveted abolition of the First Amendment right to free speech, and &#8216;Hate Speech&rsquo; laws would be imposed upon the white minority and flexing a white bicep within a mile of a non-white minority would become a felony Hate Crime under some probable &#8216;intimidation&rsquo; clause.  </p>
<p>All of this shared wisdom and insight seemed to confuse this white guy, and I knew immediately that he - and millions of whites just like him - have never devoted more than a few seconds of their time, contemplating the true and predictable consequences of becoming a minority inside their own native homelands.  </p>
<p>Are they all too busy watching criminally prone minorities playing sports on TV and gulping their beer?   Or, is the white race just suffering from a death wish?</p>

<p>Keep in mind if we become a minority; blacks are the major problem with wanton pointless violence </p>
<p>Hispanics already outnumber blacks, and while yes they have numerous problems of their own, you do not hear about hispanic mobs attacking whites. You don&rsquo;t hear about asian mobs doing it either. </p>
<p>Blacks pose a special and unique problem, whitey may make excuses and pretend it isn&rsquo;t a problem but when we are in the minority you can be sure hispanics and asians won&rsquo;t feel the need to cover it up, and they are far far less likely to tolerate black mayhem in THEIR communities.</p>

<p>How many more atrocities do we need? Weren&rsquo;t Wichita, Knoxville, Anne Pessley, Eve Carson, Lauren Burk enough for starters?</p>
<p>The murders of Channon &amp; Christopher rival the torture camps of Bosnia and Argentina&rsquo;s Dirty War in the 70s in terms of sheer, sadistic brutality.</p>
<p>The Manson murders were horrific and got world wide attention but were no more horrible than what was done to the five people in Wichita by the Karr bruvahs. I&rsquo;d wager that if you asked 50 White people what they know about the Wichita murders, you wouldn&rsquo;t find six who do.</p>

		<p>Luke - I agree with you, especially on what is going to happen when minorities start to vote in their politicians etc.,</p>
<p>I think we are seeing the future already. In Australia the labour party is popular with minorities because they chase the ethnic vote. As a result we have a party that is actually doing things that are bad for the country, which the mainstream population opposes.  </p>
<p>The Labour party gets in because of ethnic block voting. I think that when we get ethnic politicians they will start banning any Caucasians migrating to Australia and take in migrants from either the Middle East (muslims) or Asia. It just depends on who gets power first. </p>
<p>And Asians can be very racially violent. I was attacked by a group of Korean Americans when I was studying in Korea. There is definitely a segment of the Asian population in American which not only blames whitey for all their problems but will target lone individuals and hound them. </p>

		<p>If we had an alternative example, it would make a difference.  Not simply as a refuge or sanctuary from the obvious but as a point of proof that -other things- were better as well.  Taxes for social entitlements in particular.</p>
<p>As is, people hesitate to become enraged because there are so many things wrong and the desensitization element is strong.  Nobody likes being driven to hysteria by engineered means.</p>
<p>Which is why I can only say the obvious:  Document.  Document.  Document.  Place cameras on streets, in high-crime patronage (liquor, convenience, restaurant) facilities.  Hire people who can either slice the comms protocols to steal the IMs or mix and mingle to show the actual use of mobile telecomms as an organizational _preparation_ to raise up these militia&rsquo;d flash mobs.</p>
<p>An event is just an event.  But conspiracy of intent through preparation and repetition is a key factor in breaking down the refusal of whites to see black hate for hat it is.</p>
<p>The next point has to how to get the data published.  It cannot be by website alone.  Because that can be shut down.  There has to be a clear and well financed campaign to distribute COLLECTED VIDEOS of multiple wilding/FM activities.  Not one, not two.  But dozens.  So that those who want to know, can watch the imagery and see it for what it is:</p>
<p>A secondary conspiracy by the MSM and our law enforcement agencies to hide the extent of this ongoing race war, against us.</p>
<p>Only through physical delivery of snail mail DVDs can we saturate enough of the population base to beat out any secondary censorship (as websites taken down for &#8216;exceeding bandwidth&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Myself, I hope it does get worse.  Because the worse it gets, the more people will question the history of everything racial as we now know it.  The more people will want to escape their fellow Americans and FIND their fellow whites.</p>
<p>Which is the first step to a separate enclave system and hopefully, nation state.  For ourselves and our posterity.</p>

		<p>This stuff is one of the unintended consequences of attempts to integrate blacks into mainstream society, which began in earnest back in the 50s and 60s with the civil rights movement and all that sprang from it. In a nutshell, the more rope we give them (&#8220;rights&#8221;) the worse it will get. The more we cower before them out of misguided self-imposed guilt for who only knows what (wasn&rsquo;t there, didn&rsquo;t do it), the more encouraged they will be to escalate the behavior. They can smell our weakness, you might say.<br>
It should be obvious there is a global assault in progress on whites and white culture – for lack of a better word. What is white culture? It is many things, but among them is that it is the culture that abolished slavery and codified the concept of civil rights, and implemented the rule of law and equality before the law for all. White culture is a magnanimous culture, one that recognizes its own contradictions and remedies its inequities. It arose from centuries of its own great sufferings and sacrifices. It is essentially humanistic and therein lies its greatest contradiction for it exists in a world that is in many ways inhumane. It is a world where the survival of the fittest is the guiding principal.<br>
Whites are only about 15% of the world&rsquo;s population and that number is rapidly shrinking. Most white nations are in decline with negative population growth, while the non-white populations are exploding, not only in their native countries but also in the immigration magnets of Europe and America. These are not good odds and the decline of civilization, as highlighted by the above article, is thus inevitable. It would take a vigorous repudiation of the liberal (this is not meant in the political sense) foundations of civilization and its principles to stop this course. Whites would again need to march in the streets for their kind, just as we daily watch the non-whites do. But whites do not seem to have the energy to do so any longer, or the will. God forbid we should offend someone.<br>

		<p>The &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; should be taken much more seriously than &#8220;hate speech&#8221;. As of now, violent black mobs are treated as if they are not even the same as racial hatred. They are manifestations of nothing but black hatred of Whites. Google flash mobs and When they are organized by white people spontaneous dancing breaks out. When it is blacks, violence breaks out.<br>

<p>The murders of Channon &amp; Christopher rival the torture camps of Bosnia and Argentina&rsquo;s Dirty War in the 70s in terms of sheer, sadistic brutality.</p>
<p>The Manson murders were horrific and got world wide attention but were no more horrible than what was done to the five people in Wichita by the Karr bruvahs. I&rsquo;d wager that if you asked 50 White people what they know about the Wichita murders, you wouldn&rsquo;t find six who do.<br>

<p>I know exactly what you mean. When I have mentioned those names above, not ONE single person (White) ever heard of it and if they did they forgot all about it. To them it is just one more crime and ALL races have their criminals,they say.  What imbeciles. Even a couple of them, in their 60&rsquo;s had their homes robbed and two of them in their 70&rsquo;s were held up at an ATM by BLACKS, of course, yet they do not want to hear about what is happening to Whites at the hands of blacks. Could be because they are elderly but mind you, they were of the &#8220;greatest generation&#8221; of WW-2. So much for the greatest generation as they call it.</p>

		<p>Some random thoughts. </p>
<p>(1) I sure hope everybody here who live in one of the 40 states that readily issue Concealed Carry Weapons permits (CCW) has one and carries a handgun for self-defense daily. (WI will make be #41 later this year. IL may also join this year. CA has 3 federal lawsuits suing for more liberal issuance of CCWs which, if won, will bring CA and HI into the fold.) See: https://goo.gl/Muxbr </p>
<p>(2) Support the increased use of the death penalty. Acc. to Dr. John Lott, the death penalty, like &#8220;Shall Issue&#8221; CCW laws, reduces violent crime rates. </p>
<p>(3) I wish AmRen started an online forum where various issues which affect the future of our race can be discussed, debated, and where we can organize. Illegal immigration, immigration reform (of the kind we&rsquo;d prefer), and border control; crime (esp violent crime) and self-defense; laws &amp; politics (US federal, state, and local; European; SA; Australian/NZ); media propaganda/bias; and Muslim invasion/jihad are just some of the subcategories of topics I think would be worth discussing. </p>
<p>(4) Probably the best way to get some of our agenda advanced is via the Tea Party movement.</p>

		<p><i>Many white people who&rsquo;ve been conditioned to hate themselves and believe all the liberal lies will run for the hills as soon as they see a post about &lsquo;taking up arms&rsquo;, or discussing the IQ differences between the races.</i></p>
<p>Put it out there anyway.  Keep discussing it.  You&rsquo;d be surprised how few whites believe the liberal lies, after 50 years the lies are wearing thin, and, the empirical evidence shows otherwise.</p>
<p><i>I would love to tweet or post but I don&rsquo;t because some of the comments make references to Hitler or write &lsquo;Seig Heil&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Enemies of the white race love to infiltrate pro-white threads, tea party meetings and any other form of white advocacy with misspelled references to Hitler and Nazis.  This is used to discredit white advocacy.</p>
<p><i>the new non-white majority would most certainly vote for politicians and support legislation that would make it illegal for private citizens to own or possess firearms, even for self-protection.</i></p>
<p>This will not matter in the long run; once nonwhites have control of the military and police THEY will be used to wipe out any last vestige of white America!  We will be attacked by tanks, from the air, with any/all weapons of mass destruction to clear the land for nonwhites. </p>
<p><i>Hispanics already outnumber blacks, and while yes they have numerous problems of their own, you do not hear about hispanic mobs attacking whites. You don&rsquo;t hear about asian mobs doing it either.</i></p>
<p>Jealous Asians and Hispanics hate and despise whites as much if not more than unintelligent blacks.  Do not ever think they won&rsquo;t attack whites, they will, in force. These groups, ALL ethnic groups compete with one another for resources, are ethno-centric and only support only their own.</p>
<p><i>Imagine an economic downturn of blackouts, food shortages and riots in which all law enforcement niches are filled by media-molded unassimilated immigrants and indigenous psychologically prepared minorities; law enforcement personnel conditioned to believe that the people they&rsquo;re sworn to protect are noxious bigots who deserve the violence they suffer.</i></p>

		<p>When it comes to racial violence, there is nothing to converse about, except what to do with the dead bodies and wounded whites leave behind after being attacked by non-whites. Racial violence and harassment against us is definitely getting worse. I see more and more blacks and browns looking at me with hate stares, which I respond with hate stares of my own. I urge all whites who are able to learn how to use guns, knives and bare hands to defend themselves and their families. I have used guns, fists and pepper spray against non-whites already, and luckily for those non-whites, they did not provoke me enough to start shooting. Whites must lose the inhibitions we have against killing and violence, because our enemies never had them&hellip;&hellip;.and they will get us killed. While I deplore violence in general, violence in defense of self and family is another matter, a duty in fact to ourselves and our race. Everytime a white shoots, stabs, cuts or otherwise kills or stops a non-white attacker, he does more than just protect him or herself. He protects others and puts non-whites on notice that we are not going to just be pushed around or worse, not without a fight. As for the comment that states non-whites will use the military against us, I agree they will do that. If they do, then we will respond with a violent revolution where any of them will be killed on sight, even children. In other words, they will find out that I and a growing number of other whites are modern day Vlad Draculas, who will stop at nothing to strike back. If they make our lives even more miserable than they already are for many, we can make their lives a nightmare from which there&rsquo;s no waking up. That will be their biggest mistake because when white rage does explode, it&rsquo;s going to be a mega-tsunami of non-white blood splashed across the landscape.</p>

<p>So true about the Tea Party! I have long gave up on their delusional thinking. They could care less about the demographic transformation of this country as long as they are all &#8220;legal&#8221;. </p>
<p> When Glenn Beck started becoming their &#8220;leader&#8221;, I really distanced myself from them. Then when they got behind the two black candidates for POTUS, Herman Cain and Allen West, that did it for me.  Beck is about as useless and as dense when it comes to White survival. He preaches just the opposite, in fact. Him and his black Founding fathers is a joke.</p>

<p>Ain&rsquo;t that the truth. The exurb I live in was built 10-15 years ago to accommodate the White flight from the predominately Black city 20 miles away. Up until 5 years ago, it was 98% White. Now I see more and more Blacks every day around town. It&rsquo;s ironic, for all their resentment of Whitey, Blacks still want to live in White communities and send their kids to White schools. </p>

		<p>This article is dead on accurate in its assertion that there is a systematic policy in the media to suppress all stories about black on white &#8220;wilding&#8221; incidences.   Just last Summer here in Des Moines, IA, at the state fair, hundreds of black youths started randomly beating whites all while shouting &#8220;Beat Whitey Night.&#8221;  One of the victims suffered a fractured skull from the standard kick-a-knocked-out-victim-in-the-head maneuver that black punks love to do so much.   When the Des Moines police spokeswoman, a sergeant in the PD, passed this tidbit to the press, she was reassigned to the traffic division where she remains to this day.  The police dept. and the Des Moines Register announced that there was no racial correlation whatsoever, even though all the victims were white, and all the videos and eyewitness accounts show only black perps.  So far, no one has been charged and, likely, no one ever will. Earlier that same Summer, a local black high school basketball star along with six of his black buddies jumped an 11 year old white kid and beat him senseless until some cops showed up.     He was arrested and charged with aggravated assault.   But, for some reason, the charges were dropped, and he was playing basketball the next Winter.   </p>
<p>It comes down to this.   White leadership is a sick joke.  White leadership is a bunch of fools who are so afraid of being called racist that they are willing to let random whites get beaten and killed by gangs of blacks in order to avoid having the dreaded &#8220;R&#8221; word applied to them.   And blacks will toss the race card at the drop of a hat too.  They&rsquo;re like lab rats who&rsquo;ve figured out that every time they push the lever, a free food pellet drops out.   </p>
<p>This abuse will only get worse and worse until 1) whites are gone or 2) average whites get so enraged that they learn to control black viciousness they way they used to in the old days, with brutal force and constant vigilance.  The boundaries need to be redrawn and the old lessons need to be relearned. </p>

For almost all of human history, and everywhere, MINORITY rule was the standard thing, and the masses were ruled without any say.</p>
<p>Thus, minority rule applied to most of humanity for most of history.  Powerful, organized minorities invariably dominated confused, disorganized majorities.</p>
<p>Some ethnic groups (e.g. Jews) have learned how to accommodate themselves to the majority around them and still live very well as minorities.   Perhaps we too need to start looking at the best survival strategies for a minority population.  It is not impossible. </p>
<p>The ideal of majority rule was conceived when we were the majority and expected to rule ourselves. But as some wise person has said, &#8220;The Constitution was  not meant to be a suicide pact&#8221;.   Nowhere is majority rule set in stone or written across the heavens. We are not locked into it. There are other forms of governance that may, in time, serve us better. We should start looking at alternatives, instead of just supinely accepting our fate.</p>

		<p>Looks like my Grandparents&rsquo; generation knew the threat well.  Folks in that generation were branded as racist, or old fashioned. However, they were able to keep the threat in check by segregation and violent retaliation when necessary.  In retrospect, the violence that was committed by whites during the Civil Rights Era was in response to Black&rsquo;s becoming more bold in their violence (assaults, rape).  Thankfully, there are areas in the USA that are still mostly Black free and the citizens are taking advantage of Conceal and Carry.  I dare one of these Black punks to pull some flash mob deal in some small to medium size town in Kentucky, or Tennessee.  They may want to order some body bags in advance.  But, these worthless punks know that they can get away with this in Chicago, Philly or some other black hellhole like Atlanta.  </p>

<p>There is something about that Dick Morris guy I cannot stand. School vouchers and school choice? What do these morons think will happen if it is given to NONwhites (which it will, of course).  They will just turn into the dangerous public schools we have right now full of nonwhites. </p>
<p>As for the costs of medicaid, FS and section 8, you do know there are SOME White poor and elderly and disabled, that truly need these to survive and eat, don&rsquo;t you? The problem with these programs is the proliferation of NONwhites who have taken over and used up OUR resources for themselves. Most of us Whites worked for YEARS and paid into the system, the NONwhites did not!</p>

<p>First off, are you SBPDL?  If not, you read it regularly.</p>
<p>I can prove that the &#8220;ownership society&#8221; nonsense of the lamer cons like Jack Kemp was precisely that.  Kemp&rsquo;s fancy theory was that black ghetto dwellers commit crime and misbehave because they don&rsquo;t &#8220;own&#8221; the domiciles in which they live.  From that, Republican pols enacted curious constructs, allowing project residents to &#8220;own&#8221; their project apartment (sort of like a condo), and then it snowballed with bipartisan fervor to the subprime fiasco and the evisceration of mortgage lending standards for the sake of BRA and HRA.</p>
<p>I have never lived in a &#8220;owned&#8221; house.  Every house I lived in while growing up, my parents rented.  Then it was either college dorms or cookie cutter apartments, and it still is.  Using Kemp&rsquo;s logic, I should be the world&rsquo;s worst gang banger.</p>

		<p>Bad blacks are far too comfortable in white settings and events. THey need to meet resistance, stares, ugly comments when mingling with us. The same way we don&rsquo;t feel welcome at NAACP conventions or black college sports events.</p>

		<p>#38, we need to welcome a precipitating event that solves this once and for all. Maybe it will be something totally out of the blue. I do think the re-election(or not of Obama)is a possibility, as is the cutting off of welfare, or a gangrape of a woman by 50 blacks caught on tape, in other words something will happen eventually that wakes us up for good.They are just too reckless and video cameras may prove their doom.</p>

		<p>#44, yes I do know that SOME Whites needs these benefits.  Even Morris knows who needs them even more.  That&rsquo;s what I meant by implicitly pro-white. You did get my point, didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>#45, I always despised Jack Kemp.  Just as awful a HUD Secretary as any appointed by a democrat!  The stupid enterprise zones didn&rsquo;t work either.</p>

Following racist behavior downplayed [then and now] by MSM and Government. </p>
<p>MAKES ME WANNA HOLLER  by  Nathan McCall [born 1955]<br>
 [Prof Afro Am studies - Emory U]    Published 1994   page 62</p>
<p>    &ldquo;We all hated white people. The fellas and I never talked about specific things they&rsquo;d done to us, but we instinctively knew that each of us had been through bad scenes with white folks before. So we took it out on white boys.</p>
<p>      After we reached the ninth grade and were sent to the mostly white Woodrow Wilson High School across town, we fxcked up white boys more than we went to class. We walked through secluded areas of the building after classes on Fridays. When we came upon a white boy, somebody would light into him, then everybody else sprang and we&rsquo;d do him in.</p>
<p>     One day, we double banked a guy standing at his locker in the area where the wood shop classes were held. We walked as if we were going to pass him, then Lep hauled off and punched him in the face.  Then I popped him in the mouth. He fell back and slammed his head into the lockers. Before I could hit him again, somebody else hit him with a barrage of punches that sent him crashing to the floor. We kicked him in the face and stomped him until blood squirted everywhere. After we finished, we ran out a side door and went home.</p>
<p>   I saw that white boy in school about a week later. Walking down the hall, Lep nudged me and pointed him out. He had his arm in a sling and bandages taped to the bridge of his nose. I snickered and told Lep, &#8220;We fxcked him up good.&#8221;&rdquo;  &hellip; END QUOTE</p>

<p>Must read for anyone interested in how USA got into its present precarious race relations condition. SOUL ON ICE by [the late]  Eldridge Cleaver also sheds light on how current American racial relations came to be.<br>
