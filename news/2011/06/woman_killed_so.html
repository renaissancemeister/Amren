			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Thompson, Telegraph (London), May 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latisha Lawson, 31, forced her two-year-old son Jezaih to drink a vile mixture of olive oil and vinegar as part of a ritual to drive the devil from his body.</p>
<p>As he choked on the liquid she held her hand over his mouth to stop him vomiting and crushed his neck.</p>
<p>Jurors heard Lawson had wanted to drive a demon named as &#8220;Marzon&#8221; from her son&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>She had become convinced that her son was possessed and blamed herself because she did not profess her love for God while she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Lawson and another woman, who also believed her children were possessed, fed the mixture to four children at their home in Fort Wayne, Indiana.</p>
<p>Three of the children immediately vomited up the mixture, but Lawson held her hand over her son&rsquo;s mouth to keep the liquid down.</p>
<p>An autopsy ruled he had died from having his neck compressed.</p>
<p>Police said Lawson kept Jezaih&rsquo;s body in a plastic sack for more than a year after his November 2009 death until she was arrested on December 21.</p>
<p>Lawson told jurors she was convinced her son was possessed by demons as his behaviour had changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew and believe I was interacting with a demon at that time,&#8221; Lawson said.</p>
<p>She said she kept her son&rsquo;s body as she was convinced her son would be resurrected after his death</p>
<p>&#8220;I went in and just asked God to bring him back,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did it in the Bible. He did it with Lazarus. He did it with a child in the Bible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Defence lawyers had argued that Lawson was delusional and incapable of understanding right from wrong.</p>
<p>But prosecutors said there was no evidence to suggest the mother of two didn&rsquo;t understand how wrong her actions were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jezaih was an unwanted kid,&#8221; said Allen County Deputy Prosecutor Thomas Chaille. &#8220;This is a simple child abuse case. She still thinks she did the right thing. Scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawson was convicted of murder as well as charges of neglect and battery of her four year old daughter.</p>
<p>She faces at least 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month.</p>

		<p>&#8220;She still thinks she did the right thing. Scary.&rdquo; said the Prosecutor.  This admission from the one who seeks to imprison her should tell you something.</p>
<p>The above comment brings me to side with the Defense.  Put her in a Mental Institution indefinitely.</p>
<p>Sorry Folks, I always did have a soft spot for the ill.  I sided with Andrea Yates too.  Not to be Free but not in a cold hard Prison meant for the knowing either.  I believe in Mental Institutions.</p>

		<p>Well, doesn&rsquo;t SHE look like an intelligent, upstanding member of the community!  Those eyes communicate an IQ of maybe 70 at the most.  I say we should learn from animal breeders, and not let inferior humans reproduce.  Given overpopulation, reproduction should be a privilege, not a right.  Antebellum Southerners knew this and restricted marriages of their children to ONLY partners whose pedigrees exemplified health, strength, intelligence, etc.  They had the right idea.  I don&rsquo;t care what liberals say - we need to start paying attention to what&rsquo;s being bred in this country.  And maybe in the world as well.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with #1 SS.  Quite clearly there was no intent to kill.  A mental hospital is not really the answer though.  This woman is not insane, just very, very stupid.  There&rsquo;s neither cure nor treatment for what ails her.  But, in common with many of her co-ethnics, she needs permanent custodial care.</p>

		<p>Dear AnalogMan,</p>
<p>I agree with you as well and quite frankly, I have no answer for what do with these people.</p>
<p>If I had it my way, I&rsquo;d just deport all non-whites back to their native lands and focus only on America and Americans.</p>

<p>You have no idea how many young black males and females I work with are in the same boat - right, wrong, truth, lies?  It&rsquo;s all the same - all that matters is what is more expedient at the moment.</p>

		<p> You might laugh but maybe this woman was the one who was &#8220;possessed?&#8221;  The &#8220;possession&#8221; includes perhaps years of regular narcotic use?  Honestly, what did she think she was doing with olive oil and vinegar; making some kind of divine &#8220;salad&#8221; that would drive away the imps? Geeze!  </p>
