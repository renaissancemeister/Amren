<h1><a href="http://www.answeringmuslims.com/2011/05/free-speech-victory-in-dearborn.html">Free Speech Victory in Dearborn, Michigan!</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Wood, Answering Muslims, May 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dearborn hosts an annual Arab Festival on Warren Avenue. During the festival, the street is reserved, but the adjacent sidewalks are not reserved and therefore remain public property. Hence, prior to 2009, many people would distribute pamphlets, DVDs, CDs, etc., on the public sidewalks. However, when Ronald Haddad took over as Chief of Police, he announced that no one would be allowed to distribute materials on the public sidewalks. Indeed, he insisted that no one would be allowed to distribute materials within five blocks of the festival. (He justified his decision by claiming that he needed to keep the area clear for pedestrian traffic.)</p>
<p>From a Constitutional perspective, this was quite disturbing, as the government was officially limiting free speech on public sidewalks. Moreover, those of us who attended the festival noticed that security only enforced the policy on Christians. Muslims remained free to distribute their materials.</p>
<p>Pastor George Saieg, an Arab Christian from the Sudan (who has observed the effects of Islamic law in his home country and therefore understands the importance of free speech better than many of us) decided to take the case to court. The freedom fighters at the Thomas More Law Center (praise God for them) took the case free of charge, and they won.</p>
<p>Lower courts had ruled in favor of Dearborn (i.e. that Dearborn police could stop people from exercising their freedom of speech on the public sidewalks adjacent to the festival). The appeals court [United States Court of Appeals] reversed the decision on Constitutional grounds. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hence, at the festival next month, police will no longer be permitted to interfere with Constitutionally protected free speech activities. Additionally, the city may now be held liable for damages to anyone whose rights were violated by police at the festivals. That has profound implications for our own case against the city, which is based, in part, on the following incident:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I wonder how long the city is going to put up with officials like Chief Haddad, Mayor John O&rsquo;Reilly, Judge Mark Somers, Prosecuting Attorney William DeBiasi, and others, who apparently have no respect whatsoever for the Constitution, and are responsible for numerous lawsuits against Dearborn. Are the citizens of Dearborn going to continue letting their leaders destroy their city&rsquo;s reputation? Or will they eventually elect leaders who will champion the Constitution and fix the damage that&rsquo;s been done? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>That is the only way to deal with these bullies, Push back and push back HARD. They are so very fast to use and abuse the law against the citizenry, sweet reason isn&rsquo;t going to work against them. Youtube clips exposing them and court cases overturning their decisions will.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s real push back and it sets us all an example.</p>

		<p> I cannot qoute the Quran (Koran) exactly, but part or their philosphy goes like this: When few in number, be like the lamb; when great in number be like the tiger.<br>
 They realise there is strength in numbers and that eventually they will take over.</p>

		<p>They will keep disobeying because for liberals, submission to Islam trumps all liberal values.  Kind of makes you wonder of the driving value of liberalism is not the destruction of Western civilization, rather than nice things like liberty, equality, and progress.</p>

<i>From a Constitutional perspective, this was quite disturbing, as the government was officially limiting free speech on public sidewalks.</i></p>
<p>These issues and decisions have less to do with the Constitution than with the flip of a coin.</p>
<p>In the first toss, the lower court won (and we all know it shouldn&rsquo;t have). It was only the luck of the second toss that this lower court ruling was over turned.</p>
<p>We are in dire straits when such a clear violation was supported by a lower court who should have known better.</p>

		<p>My family has roots in the Michigan area for over 400 years.  I was born in Dearborn in the 1950&rsquo;s. My parents removed our family from the state after it was evident that the &#8220;urban youths&#8221; would be ruinging a once great city.  I thank God every day they left and brought their family to a safer state.</p>
<p>In the meantime, my remaining relatives have had enough of the robberies, the arson of entire city blocks during Devil&rsquo;s Nights, the rapes, the murders.  And this is Detroit.  Dearborn is a different story.  What was once a quaint but strange neighborhood of middle easterners has turned into the middle east itself.  Prayer calls ring out and are heard through most of the city.  The remaining white areas are diminishing as folks see the writing on the wall and leave.  Christians were told they don&rsquo;t live in the United States anymore and are told the Bill of Rights have been replaced with Sharia Law.  The turncoat mayor, like all politicians in this country, are interested in making a buck, not supporting the citizens and the Constitution.  Even the architecture has changed and now resembles the middle east.  It is rumored that there are thousands of muslim males belonging to a secret militia commanded by Yasar Arafat&rsquo;s cousin.  So what is a patriot to do who wants to stay and fight this scourge?  Our own government will protect these people and in fact are bringing more here.  So don&rsquo;t blame those that leave.  Dearborn will be entirely a muslim city within the next two decades, probably the first in America.  But we are almost powerless to stop it, short of bringing down this government and you know that is sedition.</p>

<p>I can tell you right now. Dearborn &#8220;citizens&#8221; don&rsquo;t care about either their reputation or the Constitution. Citizenship does not make one a loyal American.</p>

		<p>Disturbing? That is why it was considered. Do you think if a white person had sued it would have went anywhere?  It is easy to say no to whites. With that guy they felt unsure. </p>
