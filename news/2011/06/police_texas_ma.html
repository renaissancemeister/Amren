<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A father abandoned his 4-year-old son along a West Texas highway, and the injured boy spent several hours alone in the dark before a passing motorist picked him up, police said.</p>
<p>Carlos Rico, 22, stopped his car along a cactus-lined stretch of Interstate 20 near Sweetwater at about 3 a.m. Tuesday and &#8220;threw the boy out of the car like a bag of garbage,&#8221; Sweetwater police Chief Jim Kelley told the Abilene Reporter-News on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The boy was picked up about three hours later by the local high school basketball coach and taken to a hospital, where doctors removed at least 500 cactus spines from the child&rsquo;s body, Kelley said. The boy was in the state&rsquo;s custody on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of bad things. This is absolutely a first. I&rsquo;ve never seen a 4-year-old angel left on the side of the road for dead. He&rsquo;s such a sweet little boy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rico told Saginaw investigators that God told him to choke the boy and expel him from the car, Kelley said. There was bruising on the boy&rsquo;s throat, he said.</p>

		<p>I have White family members in Abilene, I pray for their safety. I wonder what the real motive for this was? Was the boy not his biological son?  Would they call an abandoned White child an &#8220;angel&#8221;? Could they without fear of accusations of &#8220;raysissm&#8221;?</p>

		<p>There`s a story similar to this making the rounds. Same neck of the woods. But it involves police. I am assuming the people were all White based on the geography.  A woman with her 18 month old baby was pulled over in the dark of night. She was placed under arrest for traffic warrants  and pleaded with the officer to bring her baby along to the station. He refused, but let her call the Grandmother and agreed to wait with her car and baby inside  till Granny got there. But THEN, Cop#1 finds out the Grandmother is coming with her boyfriend, a Sheriff from the next county over. Not wanting to get in an argument over jurisdiction with a hostile officer from another county, he drives off!! Leaving an 18 month old baby alone in a car on the side of the road, thirty miles from the nearest streetlight. The talk was that if a citizen did this, he`d be facing prison&hellip; and how the lady will soon have enough money to pay her tickets and a baby sitter.</p>
