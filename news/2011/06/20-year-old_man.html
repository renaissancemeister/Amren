			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melissa Grace, Daily News (New York), June 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 20-year-old man was charged with attempted assault and rioting Thursday for a caught-on-camera rampage that left a West Village Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts trashed, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Dwayne Jones was one of as many as 20 transgender youths allegedly involved in the May 16 melee, court records show.</p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, we had the article about the white transvestite who was beaten by blacks. His reaction to the beating was not to defend himself but to curl into a ball on the floor.</p>
<p>Transvestites are emotionally confused and unstable. They force themselves on the public and demand they be respected. </p>
<p>Black transvestites are men with the same violent tendencies of black men regardless of what clown costume they are wearing. <br>

		<p> And after 20 of these hoodlums trash an eating place, in a big urban area, police are able to find a grand total of only one, to charge?! If all the rumors about cops and doughnuts are true, you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d have come down extra hard on people who wrecked a place where their favorite dessert is sold!</p>
<p> Same old story: The mob comes in and wrecks a place of business, the owner/manager and help cower helplessly, the police don&rsquo;t arrive until the perps are long gone, and SOMEHOW even with a surveillance video to work with, the law can recognize only one face. Welcome to Urban American, circa 2011.</p>

		<p>Over 250,000 Confederates died trying to prevent this type of thing from happening!  Robert E. Lee once said something to the effect that although he sympathized with the black slave he feared more for what would happen to whites in the future.  The man was a visionary!<br>

		<p>Did I read that last sentence right? &#8220;transgender youths?&#8221; They just looked black to me. Was there some kind of &#8220;transgendered youths&#8221; convention going on in the neighborhood that day, or are &#8220;transgendered blacks&#8221; more common than I thought? </p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s interesting to learn that &#8220;&#8221;transgendered blacks&#8221; act just the same as &#8220;non-&#8220;transgendered blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it me or is the news getting stranger and stranger all the time?</p>

		<p>The West Village/ Christopher Street area has been a gay liberal haven for decades. However, since it was nearly all white it was still rather genteel with a low crime rate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changing as gay black and hispanic thugs have begun wilding there in recent years.<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/3kkunb3" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3kkunb3</a></p>
<p>One reason is the creation of nearby Harvey Milk High School, America&rsquo;s first (and hopefully last) all-gay high school. A large number of the student body are black hoodlums.</p>

<p>Is Black mayhem some type of fountain of youth? Every time Blacks run amok they suddenly are labelled as youths. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re 20 years old or 36. I think this may be a subconscious way for liberals to acknowledge the perpetual juvenile tendencies of Blacks. </p>

<p>What the heck does this mean? &#8220;He&#8221; used to be a woman, but is now a man? Or he is a man in the process of trying to become a woman? Or he just cross-dresses, or what?<br>
Of course it does seem evident that a person who is so deeply confused as to not even be sure about which gender they are, would be confused about how to act in a civilized society, too.</p>

Not to mention they far outnumber their ONE White victim by ten to one.</p>
<p>Whites today have no such luxury. They don&rsquo;t have the brothers, cousins and friends (low birthrates) it takes to form &#8220;gangs&#8221; to counter attack these cretins.</p>

		<p>One of the few things that may ultimately make sick sense about digital ID technology is that any &#8216;youth&rsquo; (forget the transgender stuff, that&rsquo;s just to distract from the common skin color) which enters a place of business to commit felony vandalism is _going to get caught_.</p>
<p>Because as soon as you walk through the door, active transponders in the frame will ping the RFID chip on your drivers license, library or EBT card.  And then assign a date:time stamp which confirms your presence at the location.  Cross confirming it with video to quickly &#8216;solve&rsquo; all crime.</p>
<p>It also being illegal to, &#8216;papers please&rsquo;, be without said form of identity at all times, there will be no privacy whatsoever in our shopping or entertainment lives.</p>
<p>Of course this is just a hair right of Hitler on the totalitarianistic abuse scale and again, the reason for the suggestion of gender as opposed to racial group identification of the thugs in question.</p>
<p>Because those who push the agenda for controlling all of us, cannot afford to have us notice that ONLY one or two groups are really pushing the envelope in terms of -needing- such a national herding system.</p>
<p>Welcome to a darker world&hellip;</p>

		<p>Yes, the news is getting stranger every day because the people are getting stranger. </p>
<p>I have a question.  Is it not just a legal fiction when one is gender reassigned?  After all would not doing so ruin the actuarial science used in things like insurance.  And of course the corporation couldn&rsquo;t let that happen, right!</p>
<p>Also, to me the big issue is the use of public restrooms by such individuals.  Where are the rights of untransformed people.  </p>

A 20-yr. old trans-sexual &#8220;youth&#8221;?</p>
<p>To my knowledge, this operation involves detailed prior counselling, extensive surgery, hormone treatments, perhaps a trip out of the country, and A LOT OF MONEY (in the tens of thousands). How could all of that be done before the age of twenty? And where did a  mere &#8220;youth&#8221;  get all that money?</p>
<p>Apparently this 20-yr. old is already healed by now.  So when did the surgery and hormone treatments begin   &mdash;    when still in his teens?</p>
<p>In fact, is this even legally possible for someone under 21? I have my doubts.</p>
<p>Forgive me, but I have to be suspicious about this story. (And how do we know the others were &#8220;trans-sexuals&#8221;? They were not arrested, so they could not have been examined.)</p>

<p>Who owns these donut shops in NY?  In California ~ 80% are owned by battle- scarred Cambodian refugees, some of whom survived the unspeakable horrors of Pol Pot&rsquo;s Killing Fields.</p>
<p>Asians are known to protect their businesses with deadly force, especially after violent black gangs and looters targeted them during the Rodney King Riots:</p>
<p><i>The Korean American community, seeing the police force&rsquo;s abandonment of Koreatown, organized gun-wielding groups to protect businesses and area residents. Open gun battles were televised live as shopkeepers defended their business from the crowds of violent looters.</i></p>
<p>As for Cambodians:</p>
<p><i>An expert on Los Angeles-area gangs, said black gangs fear Cambodian gang members because they are &#8216;reckless and unyielding&rsquo;  &mdash;  even more so than others.</i></p>

<p>How interesting!  Apparently, it&rsquo;s the same thing in NY City.</p>
<p>I had a friend who knew someone who owned a string of them in Manhattan (especially Subways). They are franchises. To my astonishment, the owner was either Cambodian or Thai. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to strike it rich in America.<br>

<p>Transgender and transexual typically refers to those that have NOT completed the process, they may be taking hormones, or they may just dress as the opposite gender and claim they are transgendered, many do not plan on ever having surgery. </p>
<p>If they have had sexual reassignment surgery they are typically referred to as simply a &#8220;woman&#8221; (or man) based on their new gender.</p>

<p>Gee, just think, we have all our ONCE White owned donut shops, motels/hotels, pizza joints, 7-11&rsquo;s, just to name a few, &#8220;battle-scarred&#8221; Asians and muslims. I think it is Whites all over the world who are the real battle-scarred. </p>
<p>I do not &#8220;celebrate&#8221; these multiracial businesses one bit, in fact, I never patronize them any longer. We have a few places left here in CA that are owned by White families and that is where I use my $$$ and if I cannot find a White run business, I do not shop there.  </p>

<p>In the Northeast, it&rsquo;s all Hindus, taking advantage of cheap SBLA loans, since they&rsquo;re now classified as underprivileged minorities. They also borrow money from their friends and relatives. If the businesses fail, they sell off what they can to pay off the latter. The American taxpayers get shafted.  </p>

<p>No it was NOT a transvestite. It was a transsexual woman.</p>

<p>Well transgender is a NONSENSE word with no meaning whatsoever. Its a joke. Transsexual makes a noun out of a medical process - a verb. which is also a joke. I would argue that MOST trans-sexing women desire and plan to have the surgery, but affording it is hard in america because we are one of the few modern countries which does not pay for it. </p>
<p>&#8220;TS/TG do not necessarily imply a physical and medical sex change. Usually, they refer to a self-identification process. As an aside, the minimum age for self-consent to almost all medical procedures these days is 18.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong. Transsexual by DEFINITION is a medical sex change. And there is no minimum age for treatment. More and more teens are being treated with supressive therapy at younger ages. In the Netherlands treatment starting at age 13 is common. </p>
<p>Finally, I see 2 possible trans-something people and a lot of rowdy black men. Now let me tell you, a trans-sexing woman would be the LAST PERSON to cause any trouble. Most want to have a quiet and unnoticed transition as much as possible. So this is really weird. I can say this is ATYPICAL behavior and they may be particularly GHETTO-ized blacks or transvestites than typical trans-sexing female behavior.</p>

<p>The point on the SBA loans is quite interesting. Americans wont take them because they under the new bankruptcy laws may NEVER be relieved of the debt. But hindus, pakis, whoever, goes ahead and does it KNOWING they can run back to the hell hole they came from if things go south</p>

<p><b>We have a winner.</b></p>
<p>This illustrates a major point about how the media uses language to control our perceptions of events. When they describe black rioters as &#8220;youths,&#8221; we immediately trivialize the crime that occurred and equate it, in our minds, with the sort of harmless suburban hijinx that white suburban kids did when I was young. <i>They&rsquo;re only youths&hellip; nothing to see here&hellip; no harm done&hellip;</i> </p>
<p>Anyone who has taught in an urban school knows what sort of criminal behavior those 18-year-old &#8220;youths&#8221; get up to. </p>
<p>Yes, you know it&rsquo;s true. They fail so many grades that they&rsquo;re likely to be 18 in grade 7.</p>

<p>SIgh. Yes, it does. Since many on this board dismiss claims of &#8216;transgenderism,&rsquo; while others seem to want to tacitly defend it, I should at least be permitted to state the historic Christian position.</p>
<p>People are created with ONE gender, for the most part. Just as the APA was co-opted to remove homosexuality and lesbianism from their list of &#8216;deviant behaviors&rsquo; by the Gay Lobby in 1973, so, now, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon of &#8216;TG/TS [sic] &#8216;rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But such an event COULD NOT HAPPEN, without the hormone blockers, estrogen pills, etc. that modern European medicine has come up with!</p>
<p>This is merely another link in a long chain, going back to Loving vs. Virginia, of working to EFFECT SOCIAL CHANGE via a Marxist Matrix Mentality.</p>
<p>If we continue to countenance such perversions, we will end up like Brazil- mulatto, mindless, and missexualized, all in order to be complacent drones of the PTB.</p>
<p>So much for &#8216;alabaster cities&rsquo; &#8216;gleaming&hellip; undimmed by human tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For that is the legacy of this Modern Multicultural Morass called America, if we don&rsquo;t start acting as if normalcy is a thing to be striven for at all costs&hellip; even if it means returning to public stoning.</p>

<p>Unless they&rsquo;re in prison in California!!</p>
<p><i>A murderer is suing California, demanding the state pay for her sex change operation and move her from a men&rsquo;s prison to a safer women&rsquo;s prison. The state has provided Lyralisa Stevens, who lives as a female, with sex hormones since 2003 when she began a 50 year-to-life sentence for shooting a woman in a dispute over clothing.</i> </p>
<p><i>An appeals court ruled in 1999 that prisons had to continue to provide hormone therapy for inmates who were already taking taking hormones when they arrived at a cost of some $1,000 for each prisoner. A sex change operation could cost as much as $50,000, according to officials&hellip;So far, judges have sided with transgender prisoners.</i> </p>
<p>Yeah, not like the state of California is rolling in dough!</p>
<p><i>The Supreme Court has ordered California to get rid of 34,000 criminals in the overcrowded state penitentiary system over the next two years. 13,000 have already been released from prison&hellip;It costs $53,000 per year to incarcerate one inmate in California.</i></p>

<p>Father John, you lose me right there!  Public stoning? How about executions too? In fact, we might just as well go and join the Taliban right now. What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>If public stoning is &#8220;the historic Christian position&#8221; (as you claim), then I want nothing  to do with either one. No thanks. We need a system that is RATIONAL, not something based on hocus-pocus and superstition and ancient Semitic tribal customs. You can just leave me out of your weird  morality! Anyone who wants that, can go live in Arabia or Afghanistan. In fact, why aren&rsquo;t YOU there?</p>

		<p>So then, I guess if a 250 pound construction worker decides to wear a dress he is a &#8220;transgendered woman&#8221;? This is surreal. It would be funny if it didn&rsquo;t have such disturbing implications.</p>

<p>Just look at our system that you call &#8220;RATIONAL&#8221; now. We cannot sustain our prison population without releasing them all. Don&rsquo;t you think that is what is happening now? Look at CA for example!</p>
<p>The REASON we cannot sustain such a huge prison population is because of OUR allowing the immigration of NONwhites the world over and keeping the &#8220;slaves&#8221; that we freed! We all know the WHY and WHO are in our prisons in such large numbers. So, now what?</p>

<p>The &#8220;detailed prior counselling&#8221; can be avoided, along with much of the $$$$, by locating some unscrupulous surgeon in a sleazy area of the world e.g. Tijuana.  Look up &#8220;Butcher Brown&#8221; aka the &#8220;Butcher of San Diego&#8221;.  I mean, there&rsquo;s going to be someone to fulfill the surgical desires of guys with amputation fetishes etc.  </p>
<p>Apologies for the slightly wider peek into the underworld. <br>
