<h1>21 Bodies Found with Warning Notes in Western Mexico</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, June 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 21 bodies have been found strewn in the streets just outside the western Mexican city of Morelia, and in every case the perpetrators left a warning note, the state prosecutor told AFP.</p>
<p>The bodies, all males between the ages of 25 and 30, were found in different areas just outside the city limits of Morelia, in Michoacan state, said state prosecutor Jesus Montejano.</p>
<p>Taking the unusual step of releasing the contents of the warning notes, Montejano said the message was: &#8220;Because society asked for it, this is going to happen to those who continue to rob houses, kidnappers and rapists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said some of the bodies were found piled together, their faces covered by tape, in areas around the city, and some showed signs of torture.</p>
<p>Michoacan state is the base of the notorious drug cartel La Familia, which is known for its religious zeal, notably justifying the beheadings of 12 policemen last June as being the work of &#8220;divine violence&#8221;.</p>
<p>Late last year the group said in a letter sent to local media it was ready to dissolve itself if security was enforced and citizens of the state are protected, urging the authorities to take control of the state &#8220;with force and decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal officials said it was unclear at the time whether the message was authentic, but still dismissed it, insisting the government &#8220;could not make deals with criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state has meanwhile seen an exodus of people fleeing their homes in recent weeks due to fighting between drug gangs and with security forces.</p>
<p>Esquivel Lucatero, the mayor of Buenavista municipality, told AFP in late May that nearly 2,000 people had left their homes, as army helicpoters were deployed in the western state and soldiers maintained a heavy presence in the region.</p>
<p>Authorities had set up a refuge for the families in Buenavista, in at least the second exodus due to drug violence in less than a year, after several hundred people fled their homes in Ciudad Mier, northeast Mexico, last November.</p>
<p>The La Familia drug gang dominates Michoacan, but it was unclear whether intensified clashes were sparked by infighting within the gang or with other groups, such as the Zetas, which are expanding across the country.</p>
<p>Mexico has seen an explosion in drug-related violence in recent years that has left some 37,000 people dead since the government launched a military crackdown on organized crime in 2006.</p>
<p>In a brutal attack in the northern border state of Coahuila earlier this week, 13 people were killed after an armed gang stormed a drug rehabilitation center and fired on patients.</p>

		<p>I find events in Mexico grow more disturbing by the day. This is where our foreign policy priority should be. Never mind Afghanistan or South Korea or Okinawa, Romania, Kosovo, etc. The hell with the Paracel and Spratly islands! We share a long, vulnerable and porous border with an unstable state. One that is historically, emotionally hostile to us, and harbors irredentist claims. The idiots in Washington need to bring the troops home and address the problems on our own borders. Let some other country play Globo-Cop.</p>

		<p>Mexican cops appreciate the good work. Gang drug warfare is a win-win always heads or no heads.</p>

		<p>When will we, and the rest of the world, realize that Mexico is the most abusive, corrupt, drug-infested hellhole on earth? It&rsquo;s truly amazing that its leaders come trotting over here through our revolving door to tell us how we should accept their criminals. Drug cartels have also set up headquarters in various places in Arizona. Its mules are scattered throughout the US. Those who&rsquo;ve invaded fo decades include murderers, rapists, pedophiles, domestic abusers and commit every crime in the book. As soon as they break in and occupy, they begin draining our natural and social resouces. They cram our schools, emergency rooms and prisons. They are destroying our country and all of this is with the blessings of our government. If the invaders kill enough ranchers, drive drunk and kill innocent people and take the livlihood of millions of Americans, then we hand them the keys to the kingdom - citizenship!</p>

<p>&#8220;WE&#8221; (many of us) DO realize it. It is the enemy who controls our government (the POTUS and the politicians don&rsquo;t) that WANTS this mayhem coming across our borderless borders to inflict all the damage it can to WHITE Americans, thereby destroying AMERICA.  This whole scenario is playing out in all the White world. The question should be, what are WE going to do about it? </p>
<p>Just go along to get along, and keep burying our collective heads in the sand, hoping it all goes away. That seems to be the &#8220;thinking&#8221; of most White people today.</p>

<p>And why the hell not, considering the so-called &#8220;criminals&#8221; in this case are doing what the government could and should be doing but won&rsquo;t  &mdash;  namely protecting the people and cleaning up this situation. Unless things change very soon in Mexico, it&rsquo;s not going to be a question of whether the country will be taken over by drug-running gangs, but only which gang.</p>

		<p>Fantasy:</p>
<p>You turn on the TV  and see &#8220;shock and awe&#8221;.  Leftist commentator: &#8220;It appears that the United States has invaded Mexico, and apparently is poised to capture the capital.  Swarms of activity everywhere!  Some are waving US flags while others shoot at the planes with weapons!</p>
<p>Etc., etc.</p>
<p>We had this &#8220;nation&#8221; below us under control back in the pre-PC time.  How can that be achieved now?  Big stick needed.</p>
