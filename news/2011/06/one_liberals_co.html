<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>Josaphine writes:</p>
<p>I am white, 42, and married to a black man. My husband is a fine art painter by trade, and a corporate accounts manager by day. We are celebrating our 16th wedding anniversary this year. We met in college in 1988 and married in 1995. After I earned a master&rsquo;s degree, we married and had three children and moved to a midwestern city. My oldest daughter is 14, and I have been a homemaker and homeschooling parent since her birth.</p>
<p>My husband and I are former lunatic liberals. We promoted multiculturalism, the arts and diversity, and we have been involved in our neighborhood association, &#8220;urban renewal,&#8221; and the urban homesteading movement in our city. We always thought our interracial relationship was progressive. After marriage we associated with a local group of liberals who dug up their yards to plant food, composted, built rain barrels, breastfed their babies, practiced attachment parenting, planned community gardens, used clotheslines, etc. We did these things too, and in our liberalism, we felt very progressive. We were very popular with our white liberal friends because we were the token interracial couple.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Things have not worked out as planned.</p>
<p>Living in a mostly black neighborhood has cast a very harsh light on black culture for me. All of my liberal illusions have been shattered. I have realized how much hatred and anger blacks have for white people. I have lost so much hope and innocence just by living here for nine years. I often feel that I have been beaten over the head with a big stick. I have read so much about HBD (Human Biodiversity), race, black culture, white culture, white nationalism, and other topics that I had never even known about. I have struggled to have a voice, and to use it without choking up.</p>
<p>We have never experienced white racism as a couple, only intolerance from blacks. {snip}</p>
<p>Several incidents have contributed to my racial awakening.</p>
<p>I once received a call from an older black woman who had at some point been an associate of my husband&rsquo;s in the arts. They were working on an artist grant program together. She was trying to locate my husband so that she could return a portfolio of his work that she had borrowed a few years back. I told her that she could dispose of the items, that he did not need them. She became offended by this, and mentioned that she could tell that I was white by my &#8220;accent,&#8221; and that she did not trust me to make that decision FOR my husband (I often work as his office assistant in the sale of his paintings). She demanded to speak with him personally. This black woman continued to tell me that she was a black poetess, and very knowledgable of the &#8220;black experience,&#8221; and that she did not approve of interracial relationships. She said that her son had married a white woman and that there were children &#8220;produced&#8221; in the marriage and she could never bond with them. They were not authentically black to her. She asked me if I was going to teach my children about their black heritage. I realized at that moment that I was absolutely not going to teach my children to identify with a sub-culture that was filled with criminality, lies, illegitimacy, and a legacy of slavery and victimology. American black culture today is nothing to be proud of and we should all denounce it and demand assimilation.</p>
<p>{snip} We have been led, I believe by God, into a new way of thinking. Since last year, we have turned 180 degrees politically, and have adopted very conservative values. We have lost all of our liberal friends in the process, but have strengthened our family in many ways. We have become religious and very concerned with the future of our country.</p>
<p>I have felt very strongly that I am to be an advocate for marriage, family, and traditional values. I have never taken the time to acknowledge my white heritage. I would love to know more about my own white family and their traditions. I feel at age 42 that I am so far behind, and that I am creating a new heritage as I go along.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I love my husband and my beautiful children dearly. They are smart, obedient, caring and compassionate. I do not regret the choices that I have made. I have realized that we have been brought together for a very important reason. I just don&rsquo;t know what it is yet, but I am learning. My life has been turned upside down with the truth, and I am trying to read and learn all I can. I used to blame my liberal white friends for living in the expensive suburbs and worrying about &#8220;safe schools&#8221;, but now I have great compassion for them. I too long for a safe and friendly place to raise my children.</p>
<p>I know this is quite long, but I have many thoughts on this issue and don&rsquo;t get a chance to talk about it often. I enjoy your blog greatly because I feel that my place is at home with my children. I openly reject feminism and homosexuality. I do not identify as a liberal any longer. I believe that white people are silenced in the open discussion of race and I don&rsquo;t like it one bit. I teach my children the truth about race, and look to God for guidance in all things. I do not openly support mixed-race relationships, but now that I am in one, I have to do the best I can to just be honest and truthful about it.</p>

		<p>For this individual, she was lucky to have married a black man who did not abuse her.  Unfortunately, black genes are black genes.  By miscegenation, she has injected black genes into the white gene pool which will bring down the gene pool if massively done.  This country and other Western civilization has set it own path of self destruction by making the whites a minority in their countries.  Sheer folly.  What are the reasons are this foolishness?  </p>

So many of our people have been living in ignorance of their cultural heritage.<br>

It&rsquo;s so sad that when they finally become enlighted they wake up in an inter-racial marriage with 3 mixed kids. What a nightmare.</p>

		<p>A good reminder that politics is not a package deal. Break one taboo (mixed race marriage) and you are not beholden to break any other (accepting homosexuality). Accept one standard (curious about white heritage) and you are not beholden to accept any other standard (rejection of contemporary black culture).  Critical thinking is the key. Bravery when it might mean loss of friends or beliefs is helpful. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that things like this are associated with liberals and things like giant SUV&rsquo;s are associated with conservatives.  That&rsquo;s a big part of the reason white the upper class has gone left recently.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;I would love to know about my own White family&#8221;  Sorry but that bus has already left&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;A portfolio a few years back. I told her she could dispose of the items. She became offended by this.&#8221;  Actually I would have been too. Life and reading psychology books has taught me that unreturned items are a MAJOR source of interpersonal conflict. But don`t ask me, ask Shakespeare!! I would have done EXACTLY what the Black lady demanded. To hear it from the person who loaned it to me to begin with. Especially something as personal as an Art Portfolio. Who needs the grief of being asked about it years later, or after a divorce, and not being able to produce the item. &#8220;Why didn`t you ask ME?!?&#8221;, I can almost hear already. Also, the black lady may have had some cultural insight on the very matter of not being able to return something after being called on it.. Or as they say in prison, &#8220;Don`t diss me when I`m trying to do you a solid!!&#8221; </p>

		<p>One of the most agregious facts about interracial couples is that the white person is usually race-ignorant.</p>
<p>If they have any knowledge at all, it is usually the contemporary dogma of cultural relativity, or worse, pop-celebrity culture.</p>
<p>If all whites were enlightened enough to make informed decisions on race, there would probably be far fewer interracial offspring. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a very strange position she is in.</p>
<p>She sees how racist Blacks are but is married to one. Plus she now has biracial children.</p>
<p>I wonder how her husband feels. Based on the article she must have talked to him about her feelings.</p>
<p>I am happy about one thing. She has now seen the truth. Hopefully, other Whites will see the truth without having to go through such suffering as this woman has. </p>

I have lost so much hope and innocence just by living here for nine years.&#8221;   Welcome to reality, you have made your &#8220;racial&#8221; bed, now lie in it. You should of thought about these things long ago before you ever dated out of your race. Now, when things get to the point of blacks telling you how it really is, you have mixed feelings (pun intended.) It&rsquo;s best you stay where you are and get in touch with your &#8220;black&#8221; side.</p>

&#8220;Too soon we grow old. Too late we grow wise.&#8221;</p>
<p>I generally like reading first-hand accounts of people&rsquo;s racial awakening but this one has me a bit confused. Maybe she has regrets she&rsquo;s not willing to admit to others (or herself) but something seems missing.</p>
<p>It almost sounds to me as if she&rsquo;s still trying to rationalize her life choices to herself.  <br>

		<p>I know a white woman who got pregnant while on vacation to the Caribbean.  She came home and gave birth to a daughter sired by a dark-skinned black who never paid a cent in child support (of course, as he was a part-time hotel worker).  Her family was appalled, but rallied to her side with financial and emotional support.  </p>
<p>Now the mother is married to a white man and has a BEAUTIFUL blue-eyed blond younger daughter.  The younger white daughter looks like a child from a high-end catalog, while the older mulatto looks like every other kid in Harlem.  The white daughter has a smart, educated, successful father.  The mulatto doesn&rsquo;t even know any black relatives, but knows that none of them had any education and were employed as domestics in the Caribbean tourist industry.  As the girls age, the differences between the two only grow.  </p>
<p>What must people think when they see her family walk by?  How many of her husband&rsquo;s coworkers whisper behind his back?  Is she blind to the mistake she made and the fact that her older daughter has 1/2 the genes of an unintelligent 3rd world black?  Of course not.  </p>
<p>She never speaks of it, but she self-consciously favors the mulatto daughter whenever they&rsquo;re in public - she seems to think hovering over the girl while ignoring the younger daughter will make everything OK.  It&rsquo;s uncomfortable to watch, to say the least.  The white daughter is very confident and well-adjusted.  It&rsquo;s the husband I actually feel most sorry for, as he watches his daughter ignored for another man&rsquo;s child&hellip;while financing the whole sad story with his hard-earned paychecks.<br>

		<p>My first response is that living in a black neighborhood, Laura Wood should count herself fortunate that she has not been a crime victim.<br>
 <br>
My second response is that rather than reject all of liberalism she should develop a more nuanced view, and evaluate which liberal policies have stood the test of time, and which have not. <br>
 <br>
Every government policy that separates us from child labor, twelve hour days in dangerous mines and factories, food and medicine contaminated by bacteria and dangerous chemicals, and so on was at one time considered to be a liberal policy. </p>

		<p>In reading the entire article on the original site, I was most struck by a line AR did not quote:  Her husband only started acting like a man after the 9/11 attacks.  Before that, &#8220;he acted like a teenager in a man&rsquo;s body.&#8221;  How could she know that and not wonder?  AR used to print navel-gazing essays like this about once a month, but I think it has been a while since we&rsquo;ve had one.</p>

		<p>This woman has had at best a &#8220;semi-awakening.&#8221;  She&rsquo;s traveled toward reality land, but she&rsquo;s still got miles to go.  Telltale sign:  She demands black assimilation.  The reality is that blacks will never assimilate.  You can wait for the next 80 years, it&rsquo;s not going to happen.  Another sign:  She doesn&rsquo;t understand that with full assimilation comes much miscegenation, a long-term disaster for whites but NOT for blacks.  </p>

		<p>The only whites who are liberal are ones who have not had to encounter bad black behavior and/or racial hatred from blacks.  It&rsquo;s easy to be compassionate for people when you don&rsquo;t have to deal with them directly.  Living around Hispanics and seeing the crime they bring and the destruction they bring, I have grown anti-Hispanic, especially with the illegals, and am even openly displaying my disgust.</p>

		<p>The problem with this woman and her alleged &#8220;conservatism&#8221; is that it hits a brick wall rather quickly   &mdash;   all on account of her race-mixing. Without batting an eye, she made the choice to remove herself from the White/European gene pool and to inject her genes into the African gene pool. She has also - likely - contributed to the bloating of the Welfare State, to ghetto Thug Culture, to crime and to an already malicious war against White people being conducted by black African racists!</p>
<p>This woman boasts about how she is now opposed to homosexuality and feminism on the blog page. And, &#8220;so what!&#8221; is all I have to say to her on that. </p>
<p>I would rather have a gay son or a lesbian daughter than a race-mixing son or daughter in my family, any day! </p>
<p>At least the possibility is still there to have white grandchildren, even if they are created through IVF or other means. </p>

		<p>Some posters will bash this woman, but I have to give her credit for at least realizing the folly of her ways (although some will argue that it&rsquo;s too late). I personally am far more sympathetic to the &#8220;reformed liberal&#8221; than the liberal who wallows in their hypocrisy their entire life, and does their best to impose their corrupt values on everyone else. Very few libs, for example, are willing to live in a mostly black neighborhood. I suspect very few would be able to adhere to the &#8220;liberal religion&#8221; if they actually did so.</p>

		<p>if she wants to let her kids live in a &#8220;safe&#8221; neighborhood, it would have to be a mixed-race &#8216;hood. her kids would have to breed with others who have white moms and black dads. pure blacks would likely attack them. i know a mulatto girl who only dates white men. her baby boy has weird bug-eyes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;My mother was a radical feminist and a liberal&#8221;</p>
<p>That explains a lot.  It really does.  Her mother was likely  indocrinated and was used as a pawn in a larger agenda.</p>
<p>Many whites where taught (whether subliminally or overtly) to hate themselves, hate their heritage, and many white women were taught that white men where the enemy.  This didn&rsquo;t just happen by chance, it was divide and conquer.  </p>
<p>Many whites to rid themselves from the induced guilt try to gain acceptance from nonwhites, and they will often go to absurd lengths to gain that acceptance. </p>
<p>The quick answer to this mess is no more forced integretion.  Return to private freedoms of association.  Whites need to hold politicians accountable.  And above all, stop the fear of being called a racist by the brain-dead liberals.</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s a sad case, but I don&rsquo;t feel a great deal of empathy with this woman. She has realized her mistakes, at least partially, and knows that they are of her own choosing.  But when you&rsquo;re stuck in a long-term mmixed marriage, with three nonwhite children, what are you to do?  It&rsquo;s rather late to extricate yourself from out of the mire. </p>
<p>She says she&rsquo;s&rsquo;s been learning and that she and her husband have changed their thinking drastically. But no, not really. Not much.  She&rsquo;s maybe on the way to wisdom, but she hasn&rsquo;t gotten there yet. So now she&rsquo;s gotten religious?  She&rsquo;s merely exchanged one dead-end alley for another dead-end alley. Well, she&rsquo;s only 42.  Maybe by the time she&rsquo;s 62 she&rsquo;ll have gotten wiser. She&rsquo;s got a long way yet to go.</p>
<p>Also, that phone conversation with the older black women who disappoved of her, was extremely mild compared to so many things that could have happened. The woman was at least civil. </p>
<p>Has she experienced assaults, rapes, physical and personal attacks?  Apparently not! She has not suffered. That older woman was simply expressing her sincere opinion,  and I would have told her the same things myself.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 16- I think you&rsquo;d be in the minority on that one about rather having a gay kid than a bi-racial grandkid. It&rsquo;s a choice I wouldn&rsquo;t wish on anyone. I have a daughter, &amp; the thought of her one day being around blacks does sound the alarm.  I will teach her to be cautious around dead beats of all colors &amp; faiths, religious fanatics who are the &#8220;Hellfire &amp; Brimstone&#8221; types, and psychopathic Muslims, etc. </p>
<p>But if I had a son, I&rsquo;d much more want him yo date a female of anyculture than to be a homosexual. I admit that it would bother me. A lot. </p>
<p>With that being said, I believe that people are born gay. Who would really choose to be humiliated day in and day out? Who would want that for their loved ones? But as far as finding her roots, I&rsquo;ll agree with some of these other posters. It&rsquo;s a little late for this woman. Even for young Whites who have sexual endeavors with people of another race, that is not ideal for most AmRen readers, but the follies of lust can be blamed. It&rsquo;s a whole lot different when you bring mixed kids in the picture. They suffer alot, too. But not as much as gay kids.</p>

		<p>I understand the jump to bash this woman for the poor choices that she has obviously made. I have a similar story but was very lucky to not have had children by my Middle Eastern former husband. Being in Utah it is a huge fad here to adopt kids of other ethnicities- former gov and now presidential candidate Jon Huntsman and his wife have several. I feel sorry for this woman more than anything- obviously her husband seems to be a decent man who has not abused or left her- yet. Hopefully more White girls will wise up and say a big NO to black men who ask them out. It is OK- you are not &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; them and you will save yourself and the gene pool a lot of mysery. </p>

		<p> Ever notice how many articulate, effective conservatives started out as chanting, marching liberal leftists? It&rsquo;s like the little boy whose dog had puppies, and the first day they were born he proudly showed them to his parents and said, &#8220;See my liberal puppies?&#8221; A few days later he showed them to a young friend and said, &#8220;These are my conservative puppies.&#8221; When his mother asked him why their politics had changed, he said, &#8220;They&rsquo;ve got their eyes open now.&#8221;</p>
<p> This woman started out as a flaming, morally righteous race-mixer. Then grim reality opened her eyes. Lo and behold, it appears that most of the &#8220;nasty old racists&#8221; looked, not like her grandmother, but like her husband. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting article. So I took a trip on over to the original site and read the whole thing including the comments. That&rsquo;s when I grew skeptical of it&rsquo;s authenticity. I believe this article is a brilliant piece of propaganda written by someone with a reputation for sneaky and deceptive behavior. Not that it isn&rsquo;t very well done. Like I said, it&rsquo;s brilliant. But it&rsquo;s not authentic. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know who wrote it as I recognize the writing style. Indeed, one of the follow-up comments by &#8220;Josephine&#8221; practically tells you the author&rsquo;s true identity.</p>

		<p> &#8220;this one has me a bit confused. Maybe she has regrets &hellip; but something seems missing. It almost sounds to me as if she&rsquo;s still trying to rationalize her life choices to herself.&#8221;<br>
   &mdash;  BuffaloNat.</p>
<p>I agree. She&rsquo;s very confused and still  has to sort a lot of things out. Maybe it&rsquo;s too late for her, and maybe she never will manage it. </p>
<p>Also, if she&rsquo;s trying to resolve this dilemma together with her husband, I don&rsquo;t see how that can ever happen, as they will (and must) end up on the opposite sides of the fence. The sad fact is that she cast her lot with another race, and it&rsquo;s too late to backtrack now.<br>
 <br>
I also don&rsquo;t like her confusion of certain issues as emblems of liberalism. What&rsquo;s wrong with breastfeeding babies or planting a garden? I&rsquo;ve done gardening all my life, and I never associated that with flaming liberalism! This woman is pathically mixed up.</p>

		<p>I am in the same boat as this woman, though I am 7 years younger and only have one child with my wife who is Black. There is no ghetto thug culture where I live here, and the reason I became aware of the racial reality that human beings actually live in is because of websites like Amren. </p>
<p>Oddly my wife is very racially ignorant, even of what Black people are like. There are not a lot of Blacks in the greater Vancouver area yet but if things continue as they are that will change. So I took it upon myself to find out how Blacks think by going to Black websites and what I found there disgusted me. It even disgusted her. I couldn&rsquo;t let it go and spent a good amount of time researching what I could, and even looking up things from a white racialist  &mdash;  Race Realist and such perspective.</p>
<p>I found sanity there, and I have spent the last few years trying to come to terms with it all. Ironically though I was quite the racist when I was in my mid-teens but moving to an all white liberal area with my family changed that. But now when I read some of the horrible crimes committed against White people by Blacks I become enraged.</p>
<p>Why do I stay with her? She is hard working and makes more money that I do, and doesn&rsquo;t carry a victim or anti-white mentality. She is an alien in a foreign land since she is an immigrant and she knows that through and through. And of course love is the reason I will stick it out with her. Though of I have been showing her the face of Black culture worldwide, she has become accepting of how bad things actually are. </p>
<p>I will not raise my child with any of that ghetto garbage, or Black victimology mentality, and I will never feel guilty for being white or the world we, and nearly we alone have created. I may be in for a trial with my wife and son, I may lose, but as so many White people proclaim how they are true to themselves and their word I feel no different. I have made my bed and I will do the best to deal with it. </p>

		<p>Despite this womans brave words, I detect real regret in the decisions she has made. Now that she is on the road to racial awakening, I&rsquo;m wondering how much longer her marriage will last.</p>
<p>The other thing that caught my attention was her expressing an interest in getting to know her white side. It&rsquo;s for this very reason that I spent MONTHS and money tracing our family tree just so I could show my children where they came from and to be proud of who they are. Turns out, they have every reason to be proud too. We found some pretty interesting things.</p>
<p>I think a lot of these young white girls today don&rsquo;t even stop and think for one second about what they are doing to their heritage and blood lines when they race mix, and like this woman,only realize what they have done when it&rsquo;s far too late to change anything. I actually feel the smallest bit sorry for her. Like a poster above stated, what a nightmare to become racially aware after all her mistakes.</p>

		<p>Wow. I&rsquo;m pretty moved by this article and have an ambivalent sense of sorrow mixed with holding back my laughter. </p>
<p>One reason that it is such a compelling account is that you can just smell her regret for everything in her life. And I wonder how long that marriage is going to last? Probably not too long, as the Africa steadily, steadily unfolds from the African. Or she&rsquo;s stuck and has nowhere to go - I&rsquo;ve seen that before too. She lost her social circle.</p>
<p>However, the most telling emotional regret is that she drank the kool-aid, she&rsquo;s obviously stuck - with him, kids, and living in the ghetto(!) - and her former friends that she lost are now living rewarding upper-middle-class lives that are still solidly and happily disingenuously liberal white lives. Sure they&rsquo;re leftists still (with reservations as they get older) but their kids go to great schools, their houses are located among other wonderful disingenuous leftists, and they are economically and socially secure in their delightful neighborhoods. Oh, and their husbands still look great for their age due to a healthy and active diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Regrets. Regrets. What could have been.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only way to express my ambivalent feelings of pity and laughter is, &#8220;Oh Snap! Oh No You Di-int! Damn, Gurrl! Ya&rsquo;ll shoulda checkd yoself befo you wrekd yoself! Knockout!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know a white woman who got pregnant while on vacation to the Caribbean. She came home and gave birth to a daughter sired by a dark-skinned black who never paid a cent in child support (of course, as he was a part-time hotel worker). Her family was appalled, but rallied to her side with financial and emotional support.&#8221; &hellip;..etc., etc.</p>
<p>Race Realists must realize that abortion has a place, and this is one fine example.  What I wonder about is why she had the baby in the first place?  Was it her goal to get pregnant by a black while on vacation?</p>

		<p>I can honestly feel for this woman. I am 47. When I was in my mid to late 20s, I must have has sex and slept with more than 40 Black women over a several year period. For some reason I was very attracted (I guess addicted to them). Two of these women became pregnant by me. One decided to get an abortion which I paid for. The other refused to do so and kept the child (my son). He is now 19 years old and is a college sophomore. He was raised by his mother, but I have had a strong presence in his life and I have provided for him economically including paying for his college tuition and his prep school education when he was in high school.I come from an upper income family and have a mid six figure job. His mother and I had (and still do) a respectful, but mostly busnesslike relationship. </p>
<p>It was not until I was in my early 30s, that I settled down, found a lovely race conscious (not racially bigoted but race conscious),White woman who I thank my lucky stars that we met. We married in 1997 and have two lovely boys. Needless to say, she is well aware of my son from my wayward, undisciplined days and my my two other sons are aware of their older biracial half brother. In fact, my oldest son who is soon to be a teenager likes him (his older half brother).</p>
<p>While what I have written may not sound like it, the fact is that over the years, I have become much more race conscious due to my wife and her unconditional love and support. The fact is that although my oldest son is half Black, I love him as much as my other two full blooded White sons. He has half my genes running through his body. I will love him and support him until the day I die. His mother is aware of this fact. As far as I am concerned, I am not a race traitor for doing so.    </p>

		<p>They met in college in 1988 and married in 1995?  That is unusual!  Most of the White women I have known who have gotten involved in interracial relationships (most often with Asians or Mestizos since there aren&rsquo;t a lot of Blacks here) have been impulsive, non-thinking types who moved in with the fellow in a month or two and then married a few months after that.  Previously, they had been in relationships with unsuitable Whites (alcohol, drugs) and generally have made poor decisions regarding every aspect of their lives since childhood.  The media image of race-mixing White women being successful and &ldquo;cool&rdquo; is just false.</p>
<p>Back to the article:  This woman is as much of a &ldquo;lunatic&rdquo; as ever.  Now she wants Blacks to assimilate!  May as well try to get a hawk to stop eating mice and go for gathering nectar like a hummingbird!

		<p>A few observations regarding this melancholy letter.</p>
<p><br>
1. &#8220;Reaction Formation&#8221; occurs when a person feels an urge to do or say something and then actually does or says something that is effectively the opposite of what they really want.&#8221; </p>
<p>A common pattern in Reaction Formation is where the person uses &lsquo;excessive behavior&rsquo;, for example using exaggerated friendliness when the person is actually feeling unfriendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reaction Formation&#8221; goes further than projection such that unwanted impulses and thoughts are not acknowledged.&#8221;</p>
<p>This excerpt seems a pretty obvious example: </p>
<p>&#8220;My mother-in-law teases that we are always talking about each other fondly and she makes fun of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most married couples of 20 years don&rsquo;t feel the need to openly and repeatedly praise each other to others.  </p>
<p>2.&#8221;My marriage is a success story, but neither of us have figured out a way to celebrate our family openly&#8221;</p>
<p>Think of all the activities that she has denied herself with her children because of the spectacle her black children would make.  After all the excuses, she has missed a lot of enjoyment in life because of her regretable error.  The sad tone of her letter is a clear reflection of this.</p>
<p>3. &#8220;I would love to know more about &#8216;[my own white family]&rsquo; and their traditions. I feel at age 42 that I am so far behind, and that I am creating a new heritage as I go along. I plant the same vegetables that my great grandmother, Vernie, used to feed to me from her garden. I have her photo in my kitchen, and I talk to her from time to time&#8221;</p>
<p>A little Freudian, funny how the phrase in brackets slipped in there.  Likely a recurrent dream.  Freud,s explanation of dreams was &#8220;disguised wish fulfillment&#8221;</p>
<p>4. Think of all the potentially enjoyable light hearted moments with other whites who don&rsquo;t know she has black children, that she has avoided because of potential embarrassment and hurt of an irreverent remark about blacks that could arise any time i casual conversation.  </p>
<p>4. Think of all the microdramas that she has had to endure, that are too painful to speak of. </p>
<p>5.  Do we really know that there were no domestic police calls.</p>
<p>6. .&#8221; I suddenly felt the true power of submission and femininity like never before. I began to feel the need to submit to my husband, who up until that point had acted like a teenager in a man&rsquo;s body. My feminist upbringing taught me how to fill in the gaps for him and literally perform his duties when he would not. The more I acted like a real woman, the more he in turn behaved like a real man. I think we fell into very traditional roles when our children came and it made us mature very quickly as man and wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a neat and tidy rationalisation, when &#8220;lazy slob&#8221; would serve as well.</p>
<p>7..&#8221; I do not regret the choices that I have made.&#8221; </p>
<p>   Oh come on, the letter is subliminal grieving, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Analyze this, from a non shrink.<br>

		<p>My racial awakening came late too, but of different reason. I am happy to say that grew up in a authentic anglo-saxon place with lots of myths from old times. I was 18 before i saw a black man and found it strange. As they and their music interested me null i had no contact that i can recall as anything else than just boring before i was about 34-6. I suddenly got this black person sent to me by a friends girlfriend who wanted him (for gods sake) to get a job. So there i stood, trying to instruct this african in simple manual labor. As my words reached nothing but ill-will and resistance, the whole of the socalled humane doctrination just fell apart and i became united with the last centuries of real experience. I was turned into a slave keeper on the spot. I never ever wanted that. But i had no excuse to not putting him to work, so i did, and found out that i had to direct every movement he did or else the job had to be done again. I went over his work after he had done it and could go home. He didnt appear the day after and i was glad.  </p>

		<p>Sadly, where does she belong?  </p>
<p>We make choices every day; this was an extremely bad choice.  Once something is done or action has been taken, we can never go back.  Often, young people simply cannot realize that certain decisions last a lifetime: like throwing a pebble into a pool-ripple after ripple after ripple.  Within her heart and mind, she knows she has betrayed her race.  To give a benefit of the doubt, she was besieged by miscegenation propaganda (a media, a government, an educational system, etc.) into committing such an abominable act.  However, the decision she made must rest with her.    <br>

		<p>I am white, 42, and married to a black man. My husband is a fine art painter by trade, and a corporate accounts manager by day. We are celebrating our 16th wedding anniversary this year. We met in college in 1988 and married in 1995&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Living in a mostly black neighborhood has cast a very harsh light on black culture for me&hellip;I have realized how much hatred and anger blacks have for white people&hellip;<br>
 <br>
I once received a call from an older black woman who had at some point been an associate of my husband&rsquo;s in the arts&hellip;She&hellip;  mentioned that she could tell that I was white by my &ldquo;accent,&rdquo; and that she did not trust me&hellip;This black woman continued to tell me&hellip;that she did not approve of interracial relationships. <br>

The black women in Laura Wood&rsquo;s neighborhood may resent her because she married a successful black man with a college degree. There are many fewer black men like that than the number of black women who want to marry them. Many of those black men marry white women.<br>
 <br>
I live in a black neighborhood. I have been mugged several times. Nevertheless, every black person who knows me likes me. A black woman stopped one of the attacks, and may have saved my life.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I know a white woman who got pregnant while on vacation to the Caribbean. She came home and gave birth to a daughter sired by a dark-skinned black who never paid a cent in child support (of course, as he was a part-time hotel worker). Her family was appalled, but rallied to her side with financial and emotional support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truth be told, many rich young white women visit the Caribbean to smoke pot and have recreational sex with impoverished young black men. The white ladies &#8220;pay&#8221; their black sex servants by feeding them and buying them petty gifts. Given both the power and wealth gaps between the first world white princesses and their third world black male sex slaves, it is  hard to blame the black men for any results of miscegenation. Let&rsquo;s face it, the white women here buy the black mans body, and should solely be accountable fir the consequences. The black men are nothing but slaves serving their white mistresses, albeit in a pleasant amorous manner.<br>

		<p> So what&rsquo;s the old cliché that hell is the truth seen too late?  By marrying a black, Josaphine joined, for better or worse, the black community. Being a brain-washed college liberal, she was very naive about black social pathologies. Unfortunately, her black (mixed) children will feel overwhelming societal pressure to join the very black community that she finds so repulsive and distasteful. There is also a possibility that her children, when fully grown, will despise her for being a white woman. </p>

		<p>This is one of the saddest articles I have ever read. Both from the standpoint of the &#8216;awakening&rsquo; the woman has had- but she is still rife with the disease of liberalism. While she says her family are now &#8216;conservative and Christian,&rsquo; she yet still remains with the man that forever destroyed her genetic heritage, by their illicit union.</p>
<p>For, within the counsel of the Almighty, the Word of God still considers such unions to be not only immoral, but destructive of a godly seed that will outlive the errors of their parents.</p>

		<p>Many liberals are willfully ignorant.  They don&rsquo;t know the biological and sociological facts about blacks and refuse to be informed.  They won&rsquo;t listen to race-realists or read any material that might enlighten them.  The liberals who DO know the truth and continue to identify as liberals must naturally pretend to buy the party line and ask no uncomfortable questions.<br>
I believe that most Americans, however, know the truth about blacks, regardless of what they say  &mdash;  or don&rsquo;t say  &mdash;  in public.  Most whites do not want interracial relationships or children.  And, of course, most whites who make youthful mistakes regarding race usually live to regret it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I openly reject feminism and homosexuality. I do not identify as a liberal any longer. I believe that white people are silenced in the open discussion of race and I don&rsquo;t like it one bit. I teach my children the truth about race, and look to God for guidance in all things. I do not openly support mixed-race relationships, but now that I am in one, I have to do the best I can to just be honest and truthful about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh please, this last para shows that, far from being &#8216;awakened&rsquo;, she is as illogical as she was before, albeit in a different way.</p>
<p>What does homosexuality have to do with racial awakening? And in what sense of the word is she going to teach her own mongrel children about race? She has put herself in a position where such attempts by her can only cause a lot of emotional anguish to them. After all, she, not they, were responsible for their mixed blood.</p>

		<p>If race reality was more accepted in the mainstream, far fewer tragic stories like this would happen. Although the writer says that she has no regrets, it&rsquo;s obvious that she wouldn&rsquo;t get into an interracial marriage if she had it to live over again. More publicity of these cases could make more people who are considering an interracial marriage think twice. Once you have made a child interracial, there&rsquo;s no way of undoing it. If only this woman had seen the problems that race mixing brings earlier, she might have had a white husband and three white kids. If any good comes from this, let&rsquo;s hope that at least some other young white woman will heed the warning.</p>

		<p>Knowing what we do about black criminality, why on earth would anyone believe this idiot liberal&rsquo;s description of her life?  Obviously, something is wrong, but the entire article smacks of deception&hellip;.going out of its way to let out anything that would be a splash of cold water in the face of any white woman considering having sex with a black man.</p>
<p>What are the things she is hiding?  Based on the FACTS about the general black population, we can make some guesses&hellip;.STD&rsquo;s, infidelity, violence&hellip;..often unusually depraved violence, a relationship based on racist dominance instead of love, child abuse, child neglect, psychopathological behavior in the children with or without any traceable pathology in the family, child sexual abuse, rape, assault and other abuse by other family members or other blacks where she lives, witness of crimes, often extreme crimes, often with racial hate as the motive.</p>
<p>All these things are the norm, not the exception with blacks.  Not just common, but UNIVERSAL.  It is so overwhelmingly unlikely that she doesn&rsquo;t experience these things daily that I feel comfortable calling her a liar by omission.  I say, this is her life experience, not what she portrayed in the article and feel boldly confident that any reasonable examination of her life would quickly show the truth of this.</p>
<p>The point of her article is to help victimize others.  Strong words by I have witnessed it many times.  WE ALL HAVE.  I have never seen the opposite or even known of it.  Like a unicorn, the black/white mixed race family that isn&rsquo;t violently psychopathological is a myth.  It doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>I fully agree. That older black woman who gave her a stern talking-to on the phone  was absolutely right. She made good sense, and was probably smarter than this &#8220;white intellectual&#8221; who had merely been educated beyond her intelligence. I have to wonder what her IQ really is, since she obviously hasn&rsquo;t fully awakened yet.</p>
<p>And I agree with the other poster [TimMcHugh #5] that the black woman (offering to return the art portfolio) was also right in wanting to hear the husband say that he didn&rsquo;t want his art back. Only he could say that and make it final.  There again, the wife demonstrated her fundamental lack of sense.  </p>
<p>Frankly, this confused  &#8220;white intellectual&#8221; comes across to me as a bit ditsy.  She exhibits a pattern of poor judgement. There are a lot of people today with fancy degrees who never belonged in college, and she&rsquo;s a good example.</p>

<p>This, thankfully, will never happen. The last thing we need are more mulattoes with confused feelings about race who inevitably hate Whites. Her case is one of the few cases, I think, where abortions are better than having the child.</p>

		<p>The first thing that springs to mind upon reading this tale of woe is, just how black is her &#8220;black husband&#8221;? Is he half or three-quarters white? Most likely, judging from the way he (supposedly) acts. <br>
Second, her awakening, faint though it is, is a case of too little, too late. She, her husband, their children, and grandchildren, down through several generations at the least, will have to live with her careless, unthinking actions. <br>
I wish her no harm, but I do hope she stays away from young white people. Her very existence, &#8220;in a marriage of 16 years&#8221; etc, etc, etc, could very well entice some young white woman into thinking, &#8220;Oh well it all worked out well for her, see?&#8221; I doubt very much that she would bare her innermost thoughts to everyone she meets, and even if she did, young people have a way of believing what they see, not what they hear. Furthermore, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want her, her black husband and their &#8220;mixed&#8221; children (who probably look and self-identify as black) living in MY neighborhood  &mdash;  I would never know when some of their black relatives were going to show up and cause the typical problems associated with blacks everywhere and at all times. <br>
Lastly, she admits that her children are not &#8220;black enough&#8221; for her mother-in-law. I wonder how her own parents feel, are the children &#8220;white enough&#8221; for them? I doubt it. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid ATBOTL is right:</p>
<p>It really is strange that environmentalism (which used to be known as CONSERVATIONISM, and was associated with people like Teddy Roosevelt) is associated with liberalism and trashing the environment with conservatism.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s because conservatives these days love to talk about black crime, but not so much about a corrupt corporate oligarchy that has trashed the American worker and turned us and our great-grandchildren into indebted slaves to Arab oil merchants and Chinese bankers.</p>
<p>It should not be necessary to choose between race realism and conservationist/environmentalism:</p>
<p>I want European civilization to survive, and I want the planet earth to survive as well.</p>
<p>Can someone please explain to me how these two objectives are contradictory ?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t there any Republican nature lovers and birdwatchers out there who have a problem with one third of bird species worldwide going extinct within our lifetimes due to excessive pesticide use??</p>
<p>Or is caring about mass extinctions of birds, fish, animals, insects, plants, and wildlife, the wholesale destruction of rainforests, coral reefs, and old-growth forests some kind of &#8220;loony left obsession&#8221;??</p>
<p>Most liberals are closet race realists, and most are sincere, credible environmentalists.</p>
<p>If you want to appeal to them, you had better sound like an environmentalist.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t even pretend not to understand where she is coming from, and I know many other Am Ren readers can relate. 
<p>This woman was brainwashed into liberal stupidity from her very own mother. Following liberalism to it&rsquo;s logical conclusion, she was being the best liberal possible by either race mixing or going lesbo. I accept her change of heart and welcome her to the world of race reality. </p>
<p>She now can be a powerful spokeswoman on racial issues. It serves us poorly to disparage her or cast her out. She&rsquo;s 42 and has already misused her fertility. At this stage, she provides a valuable public service as spokesman for what NOT to do. There are so many white women and white men that have not yet misused their fertility and could be awakened by this woman before it&rsquo;s too late for them. Cable TV and a miseducation on every level have confused whites as much, if not more, than this woman&rsquo;s upbringing did on racial issues.           </p></p>

		<p>This is precisely why I don&rsquo;t call myself a conservative. She is proud of the choices she made (presumably her marriage to a black man.) This woman states that we should &#8220;demand assimilation&#8221; I couldn&rsquo;t disagree more strongly. </p>
<p>Assimilation that is to say non-whites becoming more like whites will only lead to intermarriage, dysgenic breeding trends and lower average IQs. Assimilation is the problem!</p>
<p>We should strongly resist any effort to assimilate non-whites. I will socially shun any white and who marries a black. I am growing to despise conservatives as much as liberals. They accept all the basic premises of the left while pretending they are something else. They aren&rsquo;t. They are just another side of the same phoney coin.</p>
<p>The question is not liberal or conservative it is race realist vs. egalitarian. Until conservatives understand that they will continue undermining the very country and society they claim to love and care for.</p>

		<p>Feel sorry for that woman. She now knows that her liberal ideas were an illusion. Blacks are dangerous people, and that can&rsquo;t be denied. That&rsquo;s why I believe cities and neighborhoods should be able to establish restrictive covenants against Blacks from moving in. It used to work so well before the 1965 Civil Rights (for Blacks) laws were initiated. These laws weren&rsquo;t established because we were mean or bad people; they had a specific purpose to keep neighborhoods safe and property values from declining. Still remember when I was a kid growing up in an all white neighborhood. It was great, and it&rsquo;s sad that future generations of whites won&rsquo;t have that privilege.    </p>

<p>It is not necessarily a difference of intelligence.  The white woman was (and still is to some extent) mired in political correctness.  The black &#8220;poetess&#8221; was free from all political correctness and was able to just speak her mind freely.</p>
<p>I have seen countless politicians, school adminstrators, law enforcement authorities, and media pundits spout politically correct nonsense even thought they are, otherwise, intelligent people.  The best thing people can do is to free their mind of politically correct baggage, and let reason and observation be their guide.  <br>

<p>Did you read either of President Obama&rsquo;s books? He clearly expresses his gratitude for his White mother, his White grandparents and relatives as being the people who raised him and made him the man he is today. In fact, he talks about having met his biological father only a few times in his life. He has made this fact in public speeches as well.</p>

		<p>For the first time I&rsquo;m realizing what the posters here mean when they say blacks assimilating into white culture is a bad thing. Aside from the fact that most of them are obviously incapable of this, imagine moving out of your 99% white suburb to a *DIVERSE* big city, and realizing that 99% of blacks sure don&rsquo;t act like your &#8220;culturally white&#8221; father. Of course, most of the suburban white liberals, unlike Josaphine, never get to experience this firsthand.</p>
<p>As a mulatto who was raised as a White American and ultimately had to face reality, I have a special kind of disgust for miscegenation. For god&rsquo;s sake, DON&rsquo;T DO THIS TO YOUR CHILDREN. Going through life feeling like an outsider is not fun, and I certainly won&rsquo;t be having children and continuing this cycle. I&rsquo;m sure some of you will think I&rsquo;m a fake, but I am serious, a long time AmRen reader/subscriber who eventually learned the truth and is just as sick of black-run America. Black culture is disgusting and foreign to me&hellip;but the only thing more disgusting is the oblivious white liberals who worship it.</p>

Unfortunately, we are stuck with them because they are Americans. I&rsquo;ll still support a native born black any day of the week over an illegal, but I don&rsquo;t want to live next to either.&#8221;  The look on her face was absolutely priceless. I don&rsquo;t think she had ever heard a white person defend their own culture, race, or anything else ever before in her life.

		<p>This lady&rsquo;s story of conversion from liberal multiculturalist to racially aware conservatism is heartening.  However, even though this woman is sincere in her new found racial convictions I feel she is vending another kind of poison to people; and that is that stern exhortations will transform radical, anti-white blacks into law abiding, flag waving, aracial conservatives. </p>
<p>Or, that black/white interracial relationships can work as long as the parents are patriotic conservatives and the mulatto offspring are instilled with the proper values and taught to reject black victimology. This is lunacy and will only lead to the destruction of the European genome and the eventual Haitification of the United States.  </p>
<p>Assimilation has been a spectacular failure.  Total separation is the only solution to this country&rsquo;s worsening racial crisis.  </p>

		<p>#10- &#8220;I know a white woman who got pregnant while on vacation to the Caribbean. She came home and gave birth to a daughter sired by a dark-skinned black who never paid a cent in child support (of course, as he was a part-time hotel worker). Her family was appalled, but rallied to her side with financial and emotional support. &#8220;</p>
<p>As an Asian Indian, we (or the Orientals, for that matter) will never countenance such behavior from our own kind. And we don&rsquo;t even bother to term ourselves &#8216;Race realists&rsquo; or any such fancy term- the sort of disgusting manner in which a woman would have a one-night stand with any hotel staff in a remote location (much less one of African origin) and bring his child into the world as some sort of souvenir from the vacation is too obviously disgusting and hits in your face. Think Jerry Springer here. And any guy who marries such a woman would be treated as the biggest fool and sucker by everyone around him.</p>
<p>Whites never cease to amaze other races for such foolish actions. Looks like all the &#8216;race realists&rsquo; among them cannot keep their boat from sinking, as long as such actions like these are tolerated among their own.</p>

<p>There is also the other factor that she makes no reference to her own family. I&rsquo;d think they wrote her off. I know of a similar situation, and that&rsquo;s what the White family did.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t for the life of me understand why whites are so intellecutally obtuse on matters of race. If everybody would take the same approach to looking at African Americans as they do Anglo/Saxon white Protestants, Irish-Catholics or any other ethnic or racial group, they would at least have a realistic picture of what happens when white women decide to produce children by black men. <br>
First, women are the culture-bearers. They teach the children the cultural folkway, traditional foods, religious practices and family identity. For centuries African women in America were subject to all kinds of sexual abuse, including dehumanizing sexual atrocities at the hands of white men, black men and others. The reason that African American culture and families were able to hold together was/is; a black woman can only produce a black child. No matter how light-skinned the child is, it is still black, and therefore it&rsquo;s identity is that of the culture from which the mother hails.<br>
Conversely, however, when a white woman decides to have a child by a black man, she should understand that she will never be able to produce a white child. Therein lies the crux of the craziness. The child grows to know that it is different that its mother, and can never be what its mother is, and therefore is neither what its father or mother is. I have yet to see one of these children that is not crazy, including Obama. <br>
Black women, who know America better than any other group of people, will not give up their cultural authority to white women.<br>
White women, who love black men are outraged that black women don&rsquo;t embrace them as part of African American culture, the only arena where black women have true authority. Black women know that colored children of white women are different than interracial children born to black women. They know that white women&rsquo;s colored children spend their whole lives trying to be something than can never be, and that is white, like their mother. 99% of them marry white, seeking to produce offspring that are white, like their mother. They know the torture of being different, of being the child of interracial lust, experimentation, or cultural arrogance. They are the byproduct of white female short-sightedness. Black men in these situations, are the victims of centuries of social curriculum that have taught them to loathe themselves, and seek validation by committing genetic suicide with a white woman. <br>
Don&rsquo;t blame black people, black culture, nor black women for rejecting the added craziness of &#8220;jungle fever&#8221; and its byproducts into their already complicated lives. You call black people racist for demanding to keep their cultural authority - do you call Jews, Irish, Italians, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, nor any other group of people who demand to do the same, &#8220;racists?&#8221; Self-preservation is the first law of nature. Just because there are white women who choose to exercise their &#8220;free, white, and 21 perrogatives&#8221;, black culture does not have to accommodate them. White women&rsquo;s attempts to manipulate both black and white cultures often fail.</p>

 I&rsquo;m with you I would rather have kids that are queer than race-mixers. In my opinion, queers are just brainwashed and think they are gay for reasons they do not realize are normal. Liberal controlled public schools brainwash kids with sex ed into thinking wrong things ( Like a girl who thinks she&rsquo;s a lesbo just because she finds breasts pretty; or a boy who thinks he is gay just because he likes a little back-door stimulation). But a race-mixer is the end of the blood line completely.<br>
 The only choice real like have left is homeschooling. The race mixing woman in the article will struggle with her feelings for a long time but will eventually admit that she must leave her husband, or kill him and her children.</p>

I know a minister who has made a similar argument. He told me that there have been a number of White men in his congregation who have married Asian women and with the exception of a very small minority, no one has made a peep. However, when two of his White members married Black spouses, a number of members could hardly contain their disgust. Several members even complained to him about it in private.</p>
<p>He told me that he responded by telling them that a persons choice of spouse is ultimately their decision and as children of God they should not stand in judgement of others. He admits that the hypocrisy among some of his members is disgusting.</p>

<p>If you were a true convert to White racial consciousness, you would tell your son that even though you are his father, and that you did your fatherly responsibilities by providing for him financially until he reached adulthood, the fact that he is now an adult and that he is responsbile for his own affairs and that you do not wish to have any more contact with him unless it is absolutely necessary. That includes paying for his college tuition.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Are you for real? Tell his own biological son he wishes to have no more contact with unless it is absolutely necessary?! For the record, I am a proud White person and I do not agree with his past sexual, miscegenationist escapades. Nonetheless, for you to suggest that he inform his the son that he bought into this world that he wishes to have no more contact with him is harsh, callous and unreasonable.</p>
<p>Could you tell your own children such a thing? You should be ashamed of yourself!  </p>

That&rsquo;s a very interesting article. So I took a trip on over to the original site and read the whole thing including the comments. That&rsquo;s when I grew skeptical of it&rsquo;s authenticity. I believe this article is a brilliant piece of propaganda written by someone with a reputation for sneaky and deceptive behavior. Not that it isn&rsquo;t very well done. Like I said, it&rsquo;s brilliant. But it&rsquo;s not authentic. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know who wrote it as I recognize the writing style. Indeed, one of the follow-up comments by &ldquo;Josephine&rdquo; practically tells you the author&rsquo;s true identity.</p>
<p>Sorry Amren, but you&rsquo;ve fallen for a HOAX</p>

		<p>She is 1/4th White, and no don&rsquo;t have a daughter with her, I have a son who is only 4 months old at this moment. His skin turned out so light that most people at this point would think he&rsquo;s a white baby. Though I am not a fool, he will have black features come out more as he gets older.</p>
<p>Anyhow many of you commentators seem to be ignorant of the amount of Black DNA in southern Whites in the USA. I&rsquo;ve seen a documentary that suggests around 10% of their genetic heritage is black. The Blacks and Whites in question included real slaves, and the second virtual slaves in indentured servitude. Often the two groups worked alongside eachother and at times intermixed. This in my opinion throws out the typical Black argument that their ancestors were raped by their White masters. Not to say that didn&rsquo;t happen, but I don&rsquo;t believe it when it comes to the majority of racial mixing before the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Regardless I don&rsquo;t consider what I&rsquo;ve done a crime. If you look at as reducing White numbers through breeding outside my race, then of course I am guilty of that. But what I have is a baby that I love very much, and will always be there to love him and protect him.</p>

AMREN has posted several articles over the years discusing White women from the USA, Canada, and Europe who have traveled  to Jamaica and other carribean islands on sex tours. The poster is correct. </p>
<p>Apparently you are new to this website and are naive about sexuality in general.<br>
