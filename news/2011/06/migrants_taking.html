			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Martin, Daily Mail (London), June 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Almost nine out of ten jobs created since the election went to immigrants, the Coalition&rsquo;s poverty czar has revealed.</p>
<p>Former Labour minister Frank Field, brought in to advise the Government last year, criticised David Cameron&rsquo;s plans to reform welfare as nowhere near radical enough  &mdash;  because they do not punish the workshy or reward those who have contributed to National Insurance.</p>
<p>He also said he believed the public wanted tougher sanctions forcing the long-term unemployed back to work.</p>
<p>Mr Field dismissed proposals to simplify the benefits system as nothing more than &#8216;Gordon Brown&rsquo;s approach, on speed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Good, reliable&rsquo; people who have worked hard and paid NI should be helped more than those who have not, he said.</p>
<p>Figures uncovered by Mr Field show that in the first year of the Coalition, 87 per cent of the 400,000 newly created jobs have gone to immigrants, because Britons are too lazy to chase work.</p>
<p>Embarrassingly for Mr Cameron, the proportion of new jobs going to immigrants is actually higher now than it was in Labour&rsquo;s last year in office.</p>
<p>But his attempts to get to grips with the problem have to some extent been scuppered by Business Secretary, Vince Cable, who opposes an immigration cap.</p>
<p>In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Field said: &#8216;I fear that, at the next election, we will still be having the same debate on welfare reform as we had at the last four.&rsquo; And he said tougher sanctions were needed to force back to work those who refused jobs that they believed &#8216;were only fit for immigrants&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Field said: &#8216;This group of recidivist, workless claimants know from past experience governments leave them alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, has unveiled plans to simplify benefits into a single universal credit designed to ensure those in work are always better off.</p>
<p>Last night, a source close to Mr Duncan Smith said the figures on immigrant workers were a Labour legacy.</p>
<p>The source said: &#8216;When faced with young, sparky Eastern Europeans coming here to work, it is essential that Britons have the skills to compete.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Hey Elites!  Stop creating a society which favors a low class worker and you will stop alienating your own people away from work!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those mirror-a-mirror conditions.  These jobs only exist because their is massive immigration to England.  There is only massive immigration to England because the economy has become so rotted from within that White English are not interested in contributing to a society that they no longer feel any identity with.</p>
<p>Which shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone.  Having comes through the industrial revolution and two World Wars, we should now be at the verge of creating a truly manumitted society where the classes merge.  Instead, the society is as highly class diverse as ever and elite punish a conservative middle class by who -don&rsquo;t- spend like the money wasn&rsquo;t their&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And import a new generation of slave laborers who live paycheck to paycheck.</p>
<p>This is why genetics as a means to improve us is outlawed.  Capitalism only works based on a &#8216;business cycle&rsquo; which strip mines populations of their work ethic and then tosses them aside for a new generation of fools.  Did we all have 125 IQs there would be no question but that society itself would have to improve because doctors and lawyers not wanting to work as day laborers would never be an issue.</p>

<p>So the government handed out cushy benefits while importing millions of foreigners to undercut the wages. They&rsquo;re not workshy   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re on strike. And I can&rsquo;t say as I blame them.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been in England and I didn&rsquo;t see ANY &#8220;sparky&#8221; Eastern Europeans which would likely have been WHITE! all I saw was muslims from Africa and Pakistan also Bangladeshi. Wherever the people were/are from, they certainly WERE NOT White Eastern Europeans.</p>

		<p>Explain to me again why the English have to compete against immigrants for jobs in their OWN country?  Hell, why do Americans?</p>
<p>I meet LOTS of Brits who have fled that hell hole to come to work in Germany.  Some of my best friends, actually.</p>

		<p>A couple of years ago there was a low-budget movie called &#8220;Brick Road,&#8221; which, intentionally or not, revealed volumes about what&rsquo;s happended to Britain and especially London in recent years.  Whole neighborhoods are now first- and second-generation Bangladesh immigrants.  </p>

<p>Would this be the election in which the British electorate <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> sweep the BNP into office?</p>
