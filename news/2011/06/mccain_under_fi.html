<h1><a href="https://apnews.myway.com/article/20110621/D9O04O1O1.html">McCain under Fire for Blaming Blazes on Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jacques Billeaud and Bob Christie, My Way, June 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As if Arizona&rsquo;s immigration debate wasn&rsquo;t already hot, Sen. John McCain has ignited a barrage of criticism by saying that there is &#8220;substantial evidence&#8221; that illegal immigrants are partly responsible for wildfires in the state.</p>
<p>McCain is standing by the statement he made over the weekend as he toured a massive wildfire in eastern Arizona, but immigrant rights advocates say the state&rsquo;s senior senator is using illegal immigrants as scapegoats. Authorities have said humans started the three major blazes in Arizona, but investigators don&rsquo;t know any more details.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials say all three blazes are the result of human activity. Whether illegal immigrants were involved  &mdash;  as has sometimes been the case  &mdash;  is unknown.</p>
<p>The issue heated up over the weekend when McCain told reporters: &#8220;There is substantial evidence that some of these fires have been caused by people who have crossed our border illegally. The answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCain and fellow Arizona Republicans Sen. Jon Kyl and Rep. Paul Gosar released a joint statement Monday defending McCain, saying they had been told that some fires in the southern part of the state are started by illegal immigrants. {snip}</p>

		<p>This is payback for HB 1070 Arizona&rsquo;s anti immigration law they are mad as hell and are taking it out on honkey. We really have opened a Pandora&rsquo;s Box of trouble. </p>

		<p>He is being attacked because it is true. Of course his elite puppetmasters told him to say it so that he will look electable to republicans and others who already call him McAmnesty. Vote A3P! All the other politicians are crooks.</p>

		<p>Have you ever seen those trashy tabloids while in a supermarket checkout line?  Something about most of them you might not know   &mdash;   They&rsquo;re all assembled and published out of the same office park building in South Florida.  There has been a theory running around the right wing for as long as I&rsquo;ve been paying attention that the firm behind all those trash mags has links to the CIA, and the raison d&rsquo;etre for these mags are to smear &#8220;controversial&#8221; truths by intermingling them with obvious gossip nonsense.</p>
<p>I think John McCain is playing similar games here.  Are we to believe that Mr. Republican Amnesty in the Senate all of a sudden cares about illegal alien crimes?  No   &mdash;   I think he is trying to smear the truth by mixing it with what he knows to be lies.  The accusation, (coming from Glenn Spencer), is NOT that Mexican nationals inside the United States started the fire, it is that Mexican drug gangsters in Mexico just south of the border started the fire and started it in such a way at such a time hoping and knowing it would spread northward into Arizona, which it did.</p>

		<p>At least he&rsquo;s standing by his statement and not crumbling under the peer pressure of mexican groups. Since when is it wrong, to say the truth?</p>

		<p>The setting of these fires creates a haze or smog that helps evade the spy in the sky type drone aircraft used to look for illegals and drug smugglers. The Chinese when marching south from Manchuria to Korea - - 1950, set forest fires on a Biblical scale as a means of eluding American aerial surveillance, and it worked.</p>

		<p>These things will keep happening until we get serious with our open borders.  This may never happen with Obama in charge.</p>
<p>I just read an article from an Arizona Sheriff who pointed out that Obama is putting only 1200 Natl.Guards on the border for just 3 months and yet there are 28,500 troops on the Korean border and have been there for 58 years to protect South Korea. South Korea is now a very rich nation and should provide their own security. Under Obama&rsquo;s amnesty goals most people who support him and his goals believe that anyone who believes in protecting the border and enforcing the law are probably racists. SO, the most important question remains, can America survive Obama?</p>

<p>Only now that criminal aliens are burning down his states does McCain see a problem.</p>

<p>Well, Juan, I guess you should&rsquo;ve &#8220;built that damned fence&#8221; way back when we first told you to, huh?</p>
<p>I hope your enjoy your media crucifixion, Senator McAmnesty. I, for one, am getting tremendous enjoyment out of watching it. </p>

		<p>Just goes to show how dim-witted the pro-illegal invader advocates truly are. Had they simply ignored Juan McCain and waited a few more days, Juan would have been referring to the same illegal invaders as &ldquo;God&rsquo;s children&rdquo; and demanded they be given amnesty at once! <br>
