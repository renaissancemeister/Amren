			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Carvalho and Embun Majid, The Star (Kuala Lumpur), June 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The biometric system has been implemented at all immigration entry points to better monitor foreigners coming into the country.</p>
<p>The National Foreigners Enforcement and Registration System was introduced yesterday without any major hiccups.</p>
<p>Deputy Home Minister Datuk Wira Abu Seman Yusof said foreigners entering the country would now have their thumbprints taken electronically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The process went on smoothly and the department has not received any complaints so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the system is new and there are bound to be minor glitches,&#8221; he told The Star.</p>
<p>He added that the thumbprinting process would be improved to avoid inconveniencing visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our officers have to take the thumbprints but ensure privacy and that there is no discrimination during the process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said the system, which had already been introduced in the United States, Britain, Canada, Italy and Brazil, was necessary to protect the security and sovereignty of the country.</p>
<p>Under the system, foreigners will have their thumbprints taken and processed within a short time upon their arrival.</p>
<p>The system will monitor them and a warning slip will be issued should they overstay.</p>
<p>This will allow immigration authorities to take the necessary action.</p>
<p>In Alor Setar, Kedah Immigration deputy director Hasreena Hashim said the department conducted a trial run of the system several weeks ago to identify problems in its implementation.</p>
<p>The trial run was conducted after the system was installed at all the entry points in the state.</p>
<p>In Penang, state Immigration director Abdul Qadir Siddiq Ahmad said the system had been in force on a trial basis since May 13.<br>

		<p>I could be mistaken, but I believe Malaysia was the country that had the first succesful immigration amnesty a few years ago. </p>
<p>What they did in their amnesty is they gave everyone living in the country illegally 90 days to leave, and employers 90 days to end employment of illegals. At the end of 90 days they publicly caned and imprisoned all immigration lawbreakers, but gave them amnesty for the first 90 days. It worked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our officers have to take the thumbprints but ensure privacy and that there is no discrimination during the process,&rdquo; he said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for.</p>
<p>When AQ Khan&rsquo;s SCOPI complex made thousands of centrifuge parts for Iran and Libya in the mid-90s (because none of the Persian Gulf countries had smart enough technician classes to do so), we essentially lost, for all time, the secrets to nuclear proliferation.</p>
<p>SCOPI was centered in Malaysia where a Sri Lankan man by the name of Tahir married into the Malaysian elite and was able to use his wife&rsquo;s machine shop company to create centrifuge rotors, spining at tens of thousands of RPM with required tolerances of hundredths of millimeters because of the extremely corrosive UHF gas involved.</p>
<p>Before they had been making plumbing and automotive components.</p>
<p>Tahir was helped by a family of Swiss traitors, one of who&rsquo;s sons, Urs Tanner, with the complete approval of the CIA case officer who was running him, managed the factory.</p>
<p>Would this national thumbprint system have stopped this operation?  No.  Because the CIA knew about it from the start and -chose- not to intervene, thinking they could roll up the whole rotten bunch.  See the movie &#8216;Firefox&rsquo; for how that turned out with nuclear secrets slipping forever out of our control, on an almost daily basis, courtesy of the Internet.</p>
<p>Since you cannot control internal agencies of upper class evil with a system that only applies to foreign nationals crossing a border, what the biometric ID system now being tested in far away places is actually for is to control the rest of us.  The poor schmucks whose only advantage is our ubiquity and anonymity.</p>
<p>Once the system is electronically fine tuned and rendered cheap enough to be universally applicable.</p>
<p>Once the -idea- of being herded like cattle through points of entry, not just at borders but in every shop, vehicle, library, movie theater and the like is accepted as &#8216;common place = harmless&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It will come here.  In force.  And we will be able to do nothing about it because our ability to privately associate and exchange ideas with whom we like  Will be as equally subject to oversight and preemptive judgment as our public equivalent now is.</p>

		<p>It could work here. Except that our &#8220;elites&#8221; have NO WISH to control our borders.</p>
