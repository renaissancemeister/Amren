<h1>FBI Investigating Reported Somali-American Suicide Bomber</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Welch, CNN, June 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The FBI is investigating reports that a suicide bomber who killed two African Union soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia, this week was an American citizen, an FBI spokesman said Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Days after Monday&rsquo;s suicide bombing, al-Shabaab, a Somali militant group allied with al Qaeda, posted a statement on its website identifying the suicide bomber responsible for Monday&rsquo;s bombing as Abdullahi Ahmed, a Somali-American from Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Al-Shabaab also posted a statement and a 20-minute audio clip from the man it identified as the suicide bomber, who spoke in English during part of the recording.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a member of al-Shabaab for two years. I am from Minnesota, USA,&#8221; Abdullahi Ahmed is quoted as saying in the statement. &#8220;I am so happy to turn my body into shrapnel for the infidels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Omar Jamal, the first secretary to the Somali Mission to the United Nations, said the man speaking on the audio recording brought back a &#8220;vivid memory&#8221; of his former acquaintance, Abdullahi Ahmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This guy was a young guy, he was a taxi driver in Minneapolis &hellip; I met him a couple of times, and we debated about the current Somali situation and Jihadist philosophy,&#8221; said Jamal, a Minneapolis resident and advocate for the city&rsquo;s Somali community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2008, a sizable group of young Somali-American men left Minneapolis  &mdash;  home to the nation&rsquo;s largest Somali population  &mdash;  and were feared recruited by al-Shabaab. Several were reported killed, according to Minneapolis community leaders.</p>
<p>The family of one, Jamal Bana, 20, told CNN in 2009 that they learned of his death via the Internet. Another one, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, blew himself up and killed 29 others in the fall of 2008 in what was believed to be the first suicide bombing carried out by a naturalized U.S. citizen. The incident raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Al-Shabaab has been waging a war against Somalia&rsquo;s government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia law. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has added to the impoverished East African nation&rsquo;s humanitarian crisis.</p>

		<p>Somalis are among the worst and most terrible people to allow into a western country. They should not be here.</p>

		<p>Typical evil conservative media! They just don&rsquo;t report all the German-American suicide bombers, the British-American aircraft hijackers and the Italian-Americans who turn once-thriving cities into uninhabitable wasteland.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t worry about the ones who go back.  I&rsquo;m displeased with the number who stay.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I have a very hard time seeing a suicide bomber &#8216;happy to turn his body into shrapnel&rsquo; as rising to the level of discourse necessary for intelligent debate.</p>
<p>By reasoned application of ethics, someone who will blow themselves to bits and in the process removes their philosophical opponent from life as well, can neither continue to expound a point of view nor convince anyone else of it&rsquo;s moral authenticity.</p>
<p>They will only despise you Mr. Ahmed.  For the savageness by which you acted and the stupidity by which you left a better life to do it.</p>

		<p>The good news is, HE&rsquo;S DEAD!!!  And so are his fellow suicide bombers.  May they all follow suit, in one of their own countries, toot sweet.  (And why are we letting pigs like them in to the U.S.?)</p>

		<p>The way for the FBI to catch more of these madmen is to do more cavity searches on 80 year old white women.<br>
Wake up America, know your enemy and watch him.<br>
Leave innocent people alone for g*ds sake.</p>
