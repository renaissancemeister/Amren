<h1>Fox Business Host Apologizes for Using &#8216;Language Interpreted&rsquo; as Racist: &#8216;We Did Go a Bit Too Far&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News, June 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eric Bolling, host of the Fox Business Network show &#8220;Follow the Money,&#8221; apologized to viewers on Monday for using racist language during a segment that aired last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a segment that aired on Friday, Bolling referred to the White House as the &#8220;Hizzouse&#8221; and &#8220;Hizzy,&#8221; and President Obama&rsquo;s guests  &mdash;  including Gabon President Ali Bongo  &mdash;  as &#8220;hoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did go a bit too far,&#8221; Bolling admitted.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m amazed he wasn&rsquo;t fired on the spot.  Don&rsquo;t misinterpret me either.  I&rsquo;m not saying that he should have been fired.  However, an equivalent comment about Whites would have gone completely unnoticed, or perhaps even celebrated.</p>

<p>Too true. An adult shouldn&rsquo;t lower themselves to their level.</p>
<p>The guy let his guard down thinking he was being hip and he made the mistake of believing we live in a post-racial American.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised this happened. What&rsquo;s surprising is that he doesn&rsquo;t understand the rule of &#8216;who can say what&rsquo;.<br/>

<p>Ebonics is constantly in evolution. It&rsquo;s such a rich, exciting vehicle of communication; always changing. I cringe when I hear &#8220;whites&#8221; using expressions such as &#8220;jive turkey&#8221;, &#8220;been wif yo mama&#8221;, &#8220;honky&#8221; and the ultimate redflag of archaic uncoolness &#8220;ofay&#8221;. It&rsquo;s all so &#8220;yesterday&#8221;.</p>
<p> Let&rsquo;s not reduce Ebonics to the status of classical Latin. BTW is &#8220;know whaam sain?&#8221; still an OK  tag phrase with which to end a declarative sentence thereby making it an interrogative?</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all git beck to me wif a ansah Yo!<br/>

		<p>This is all quite interesting stuff, to hear about a television presenter using gutter-talk to &#8216;reach out&rsquo; to an audience&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the UK, there seem to be just too many whites trying to emulate their cool &#8216;hipster&rsquo; black contemporaries.</p>
<p>Even such phony gestures as &#8216;high-five&rsquo; is something I would entirely avoid.</p>
<p>Such behaviour may be understandable among &#8216;teens&rsquo; and &#8216;young people&rsquo;; always primary targets of Change Agents (and probably not just for the malleability of their minds alone), though for any self-respecting individuals, it is something that is beneath contempt.</p>
<p>I am reminded of white men of early middle age who insist on posturing with the belief that junk &#8216;music&rsquo; rivals any of our own productions. </p>

		<p>Anyone who has children can figure out what ebonics really is   &mdash;    the speech patterns of little kids whose grammar was never properly corrected by their parents.  3 year olds say all kinds of adorable things, like &#8220;I just swimmed in grandma&rsquo;s pool!&#8221;, and as the parent, you respond with &#8220;Oh, you just swam in grandma&rsquo;s pool, that&rsquo;s great!&#8221;, and so on&hellip;.</p>
<p>Apparently some black parents just don&rsquo;t correct their children.  Drives Bill Cosby crazy.</p>
