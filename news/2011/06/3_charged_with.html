		<p>The first thing I ever learned riding the bus late at night was to never SIT at the stop on the bench. As soon as you did, two guys would be hovering over you asking for a cigarette&hellip; So I started to stand about ten feet away and keep my scam radar at full frequency&hellip; Hope this helps to anybody else unlucky enough to have to ride. Sadly, I have no real advice for anyone having to get on&hellip; Myabe sit next to the driver and hope the wave rolls past you before it breaks on the passengers further back&hellip;</p>

<p>If they had just as much opportunity, they would turn out to be brain surgeons and executives in equal numbers to US and not violent criminals?</p>
<p>I simply cannot believe that the media ignore all of this barbaric and sadistic behavior that is on the up rise in many of our cities.<br>

		<p>Decades ago in Chi there used to be what was called &#8220;Jesse James&#8221;. Hoodlums would walk through the elevated trains [EL] robbing the passengers and then get off just as the train was pulling out of the station en route to the next stop. One time someone blasted the two villains and when the train reached the end of the line there were no passengers on board, only the two dead bodies. Typical Chi in many respects.</p>

		<p>Many years ago I read an account about how a few armed blacks from Compton,CA, on a bus from Los Angeles to the north pulled their guns, robbed the passengers, and worst of all, verbally brutalized the white passengers.They told them that they wanted to kill them, and over and over again said how much they hated Whitey.They were caught. I wonder what their sentences were? They couldnt have been very long.Does anyone remember this?</p>

		<p>I find it ironic and amusing to read about these two bus attacks by black males after yesterdays PC article from Mary Schmich about omitting race in news stories. Actually, I would find it hysterically funny if it wasn&rsquo;t so scary. How about another commentary about THIS one Mary? Hmmm?</p>

		<p>I live in Chicago and am very familiar with this columnist. She is a devout SWPL, of the &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; variety. Years ago she wrote a column about a man who was on TV because he was involved in the Clinton Monicagate story. She wrote of how handsome he was and how she had a crush on him. The mans name? ERIC HOLDER!! I felt at the time she took a weirdly cloying, submissive pride in openly demonstrating her sexual attraction to a black male   &mdash;   even a light-skinned one like Eric. As John Lennon said,&#8221;&hellip;strange days, indeed.  Most peculiar,mama!&#8221;</p>

It was kind of sad. They seemed like decent folks. Indeed, one was a college professor. Nevertheless, they were complaining to the wrong people. They should have been telling young black men to stop committing all those crimes. </p>

		<p>From Second City Cop, today:</p>
<p><i>&hellip;on todays date 15-20 black teens&hellip; got off of the bus and out of cars at 111th and Kedzie and broke buisness windows, car windows and attacked pedestrians&hellip; all pedestrians and vehicles were that of white people&hellip;..a white females car was destroyed as she sat in it and male and female white pedestrian were attacked. Clearly white people are being chosen and targeted among the black offenders&hellip; why is this not a hate crime?? what would happen if the same group were white people who went to the ghetto and ONLY targeted black people and left white people alone???? yep, you guessed it.. hate crime. Why did the 111th and kedzie wildings not make the news?</i></p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/19GN5" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/19GN5</a></p>
<p>Also, an animal welfare group is canceling an event that was to be held in the neighborhood where these anti-white mob wildings are occurring, and the Illinois NRA affiliate is issuing a State Department like travel advisory against Chicago:</p>

		<p>During the early 1970s the MSM covered up the fact that the zebra murders were racially motivated. Lives could have been saved if whites knew they were at risk because of their race.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening now.  The real story is that the leftists want white people to be victimized.  The reality is That they&rsquo;re genocidists who support hatred and violence toward whites.</p>

		<p>Believing is seeing </p>
<p>Professional skeptic Michael Shermer has famously noted that our brains are belief engines. We humans tend to see what we believe rather than believe what we see. Advocates of multiculturalism are aware of that fact. By tinkering with our brains&rsquo; programming, a belief system can be installed that will cause us to deny reality and cling to a delusion as if it were a religion. </p>
<p>Case in point: The days of summer, 2011, have been marred with black-on-White racism. Our mental program, however, refuses to acknowledge the obvious. We don&rsquo;t see black thugs terrorizing White people at theme parks, water parks, on public and school buses, etc. </p>
<p>What we &#8220;see&#8221; is White privilege and White racism. Even as we gaze at YouTube videos of black thugs rampaging through a upscale White business district, our minds are programmed to reject reality and replace it with delusions. </p>
<p>When hundreds of blacks scaled the walls of a Nashville water park, our minds followed the program: We saw the Hollywood version of evil White people banning sweet, harmless little black kids from swimming pools. </p>
<p>When hordes of hundreds of thousands of blacks descended on Miami a few days ago, our programmed minds failed to see that overt black-on-White racial hatred and violence.</p>
<p>When Memorial Day beach goers were terrorized by black thugs on Memorial Day in Boston, we saw it but our brains were programmed to trigger feelings of White guilt and self-condemnation as &#8220;racist&#8221; for even considering the fact that blacks were behaving badly.</p>
<p>When flash mobs repeated attacked Whites in Chicago over the past few days, we saw nothing; nothng at all. </p>
<p>The challenge is reconnect with reality. Effectively go to our brain&rsquo;s &#8220;control panel,&#8221; click on &#8220;add or remove programs,&#8221; seek for malware programs titled &#8220;White guilt,&#8221; and &#8220;White privilege,&#8221; and delete.<br>

<p>Thank goodness the animal rescue group cancelled. Those groups are 95% White women with the odd White husband helping out, mix in dozens of dogs and puppies in pens that cannot be quickly moved and they would all be the perfect sitting duck targets for a mob of crazed abusive blacks.</p>

		<p>  The crime situation in Chicago is starting to resemble Brazil, where bus robberies are common near the Favelas in Rio and Sao Paulo. I fear the Brazilification of our country has accelerated since the election of President Obama. Here we are becoming a Northern Brazil, but without the good times and fun loving, free spirited women. </p>

<p>Jeddermann,<br>
Now THAT&rsquo;S what you call a &#8220;Happy Ending&#8221;!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Some of my colleagues in Philadelphia used to ride the EL into work. They always referred to it as &#8220;The African Queen&#8221;.<br>
One night one of them was riding home when a &#8220;band of bruthas&#8221;<br>
got onto the train and began running through the cars unsscrewing the light bulbs and throwing them at passengers. He said that two of the cars were in total darkness before the next station where &#8220;Da Youfs&#8221; got off. This was 25 years ago when things relatively speaking weren&rsquo;t as bad as they are now.</p>
<p>Just think of what a different country this would be if they all went away. We could deal with our White criminal element and there would be no jury nullifications and capital punishment might be a deterrent because it would be used against White  Capital offenders.<br>
Our streets, public transportation and parks would again be safe and people like Channon and Christopher would be able to go out  in the vehicle to visit friends and return safely to their families. Anne Pressley would have slept safely in her bed and awakened to go to work at the TV station the next morning. The Wichita five would have spent a nice evening together and the one young man would have been able to give his sweetheart the  engagement ring he had bought for her. <br>
Eve Carson and Laruen Burk would have been at their graduations to receive their diplomas.<br>
THe Columbia student would be working at her chosen profession instead of having been raped, tortured and burned in her own apartment etc,, etc.. </p>

		<p>I guess those fine upstanding young men were not properly challenged in their scoo&rsquo; by their white teachers.  I am sure their teachers, many of them liberal young females, fawned all over them and passed them with A&rsquo;s.  What about all the government support, welfare and food stamps they got?  Or the late-night basketball hours in the local park?  What about the mentors programs or the many city youth services?  What sidetracked these budding scholars?  It must be whitey&rsquo;s fault somehow!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care how decent these blacks were.  Nobody has a right to be liked.  Yes, they have civil rights and civil liberties.  But I&rsquo;m not required to like any black person, (even if no black ever committed any crime), or any person in general, and nobody is required to like me.  If they were so smart, they should grok this nuance.</p>

AS QD said about, no one has any RIGHT to be liked. Nor does anyone else have any RESPONSIBILITY, or obligation, to like them. It&rsquo;s a purely personal matter.</p>
<p>As far as those blacks whose feeling were hurt&hellip; well, that&rsquo;s merely unfortunate.  But   &mdash;   sorry   &mdash;   I have a much greater responsibility to my own personal safety and wellbeing than to any worries about their touchy feelings. I am not going to risk getting insulted, robbed or stabbed just to spare somebody&rsquo;s feelings.</p>

<p>I lived in the suburbs when UIC ws being built.  For years the papers were full of articles about how the building site was &#8220;racist&#8221; because the campus would constitute a big area cutting off a nearby ghetto from a business area.  It would mean that black muggers and rapists would be inconvenienced have to walk or drive around the campus to get to their victims.</p>
<p>The area is very unsafe.  I remember when a visiting Asian professor, a nobel prize winner was robbed and beaten while walking on Roosevelt Rd.  That was in the news.  The ordinary robberies and assaults are of course covered up.<br>

<p>Rich,<br>
White people WILL wake up and hopefully before it&rsquo;s too late. The biggest problem is that our children have been propagandized to believe that to show displeasure at the criminal behavior of Blacks is racist and to be called a racist is like wearing the mark of Cain.<br>
The sexual attacks on White coeds on our university campuses is reaching major proportions. We hear about only the most horrific i.e. the ones who end up fatally for the young woman e.g Eve Carson and Lauren Burk or the Columbia coed while although not murdered was hideously tortured, burned and mutilated.<br>
We read these horror stories and hope that someday soon it will all go away but it won&rsquo;t unless WE take the steps to bring it about.<br>
