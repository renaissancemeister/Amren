<h1>Suspected Flash Mob Rips Off Upper Darby Sears (with Video)</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Reilly, Daily Times (Delaware County), June 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A mob of about 40 people stormed into the Sears department store on 69th Street Thursday, and in a flash stole thousands of dollars worth of merchandise, officials said.</p>
<p>Police were able to round up 15 juveniles and one adult, 19, all from West Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&#8220;They came in on the El train and hit Sears,&#8221; police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said. &#8220;They stole sneakers, socks, watches, whatever they could get their hands on, and left.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine the guts of this gang of young hoodlums. One was 11 years old. The others arrested ranged from 12 to 16 years old. They planned this out earlier in the day on a social networking site. It was pre-planned. They got on the El, got off at 69th Street Terminal and walked up the hill to Sears.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The parents should be held accountable,&#8221; Chitwood said. &#8220;And where were the parents of the 11- and 12-year-olds when their children were riding into 69th street with a mob of teenagers? If I could, I would charge the parents. Certainly, this is unacceptable behavior. It was intentionally planned earlier in the day to gather and go to Upper Darby to rob and pillage. There has [sic] got to be consequences, and I don&rsquo;t mean a slap on the wrist. The county has got to send a strong message. This was a (pack) attack and will not be tolerated.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Somehow, a part of me thinks of this story as &#8220;petard hoisted own.&#8221;  Sears panders big time to blacks, because it granted a franchise several years back to a relative of someone who was at the time a radical black talk radio host in St. Louis, that being Lizz Brown, for those of you who are familiar with her name.  The store opened up in the heavily black northwestern part of the city.</p>

		<p>I just watched the video. I can&rsquo;t write what I really want, but I now understand why they had Jim Crow laws. They are necessary if one wishes to have civilization.</p>
<p>I notice in the view from inside the store there was a black lady leaving. She stopped and looked. She knew, by looking at all the &#8220;youtts&#8221; that something was up. Since she is from the community, she could tell something was going to happen. </p>

<p>Video cameras must be racist since they show a disproportionate number of African Americans committing crimes.</p>
<p>They can organize a robbery but can&rsquo;t organize a math or science club at school?</p>
<p>They did organize a vigil against crime at one of our local schools.  Guess what happened?  Yep&hellip;.fights broke out and the cops had to break it up.  On my father&rsquo;s grave that is the truth.  </p>

		<p>Against 40 of them what are you supposed to do? It&rsquo;s getting to the point where the fight has to be taken to their &#8220;turf&#8221; i.e. groups of Whites going into the black neighborhoods and retaliating. And we all know that&rsquo;s not about to happen. The only group willing to make it happen is the invading Mexicans.</p>

<p>Darby officials vow to take borough back, implement state of emergency [ Philadelphia ]<br>
delcotimes.com ^ | June 26 2011 | By LAURA WISELEY </p>
<p>Posted on Monday, June 27, 2011 12:12:08 PM by NoLibZone</p>
<p>DARBY BOROUGH  &mdash;  The borough is back under a state of emergency today after being rocked by at least five violent incidents in a 72-hour period. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are taking the borough back,&rdquo; Mayor Helen Thomas said during a Friday-night press conference to declare the state of emergency. &ldquo;We want everyone to understand that this has to stop, and it&rsquo;s going to stop tonight.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Officials put the state of emergency declaration into effect at 8 p.m. Friday. Under the declaration, an 8 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew is in effect for adults and juveniles throughout the borough, and anyone discovered to be out during that time frame is subject to immediate stop-and-frisk procedures. </p>
<p>Police will concentrate primarily on groups of three or more individuals who are loitering or causing a disturbance. </p>
<p>The curfew will remain in effect for 10 days, after which, Thomas said, officials will re-evaluate the measure and decide whether to continue it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;(The criminals) are tearing the borough up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are too many guns and too many drugs. Tonight, the cells are going to be full.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The declaration was prompted by five violent incidents in the 72 hours preceding Friday&rsquo;s announcement. Those incidents included a stolen-car chase Thursday afternoon that ended with police shooting the driver after a confrontation at Fifth and Pine streets. </p>
<p>In an unrelated event earlier that day, a 27-year-old man was shot four times during a robbery in the 500 block of Spruce Street. </p>
<p>Later Thursday night, police were called to the 600 block of Darby Terrace for a report of a man with a gun barricaded inside a home.</p>

		<p>[One sad part about this is that the Sears brand will likely fold shortly, into K Mart.]  Note that, in the video, passersby did not seem alarmed by the flash mob on the sidewalk, or as the flash mob entered the store.  I would have behaved as if physical attack were immanent. </p>

		<p>When I was a kid 69th Street was a favorite destination for hanging out on a Saturday afternoon and a place for thousands of mostly white, working class shoppers to spend a few pleasant hours.</p>
<p>This was, of course, before the days of the mall.  If you liked to shop, 69th Street was the place to go.  But now?</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s like the rest of West Philadelphia and, indeed, the city as a whole.  Another urban area ruined by black thugs and their ghetto brethern. </p>

  Wow! That should scare da youfs! What a joke. We&rsquo;ve been tolerating it for years. Guards with shotguns loaded with beanbags should be deployed in malls where there are large numbers of Mau Mau. If that doesn&rsquo;t work then upgrade to .00 buckshot.</p>

<p>Right. And what does Mr. Chitwood think he is going to do about it? Throw them in jail? Have their parents send them to their rooms? Wait till Jessie Jackson, the NAACP and the Obama Justice Dept get through with Mr. Chtiwood, instead of the police superintendent, he&rsquo;ll be lucky to be a crossing guard. </p>
<p>Sears will just suck it up and drop the charges out of fear of charges of racism, bad publicity and loss of Black customers.<br>

		<p>Marshall Fields made his career on realizing that the merchandise should be where the customers are, not behind a counter with the clerk. Sadly, one hundered years of retail progress may be heading in the opposite direction. <br>
  I also remember how my dad would comment on seeing a Toyota commercial, &#8220;Brought to you by the people who gave you Pearl Harbour&hellip;&#8221; To which I would add, &#8220;Flash Mob beatings and robberies. Brought to you by the same folks who gave you carjackings&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting is how the camera operator at first is focused on the obvious theft of a pair of sneakers.  The camera follows the thief for a bit than it becomes obvious the store is absolutely filled with them.  It must have been a shock and awe kind of moment.  It seems pretty obvious this is genuine organized crime and we do have statutes specifically designed to deal with it.  Especially when you consider it was organized electronically.  What I find puzzling is that the crooks are all dressed differently.  If they all had on the same colors a grainy security camera video could easily confuse a jury and create the doubt most of these crooks would need if caught.  &#8220;It wudd nunna me, it waa dat udder dude&#8221; would become the standard of courtroom defense in these cases.  So while they are organized, they are still pretty stupid overall.  It&rsquo;s clear they expected some to be caught but didn&rsquo;t care.  Perhaps the juveniles were sacrificial pawns who were more than happy to get arrested for their &#8220;skreet cred&#8221;.  Sears wins no sympathy from me since ti is clear they didn&rsquo;t hire enough real security and didn&rsquo;t have a plan in place to lock the store down once they saw this happening.  I wonder how many real security guards were replaced by those cheap cameras?  What I do know is that the take will not be high enough for Sears to justify a real security team.  They&rsquo;ll take it on the chin to satisfy the bean counters and leave other businesses to fend off the mobs.  Whatever happened to tough retail managers and burly security guards?<br>

<p>I agree with you. That black lady clearly knew something was up and decided to get her butt out of there real quick. Blacks know what the deal is with other blacks. I used to work with this black women and she was always talking bad about other blacks. She would point something out to me about a black guy pulling a scam or something all the time. She was always right too. She mentioned many things to me about blacks and how they thought (race is central to their thinking). She would say, always matter of factly, things about them, like a black guy has to show off when he gets money, and would &#8216;go bling&rsquo; (this was how she knew the guy dating her daughter didn&rsquo;t have all the money he claimed). She gave me a lot of insight about how blacks are. </p>

		<p>#14,Jim Crow is coming back.It is the default position for any nation with large black populations.Segregation has been practiced with blacks since the beginning, for obvious reasons, now again evident to our generation.What sickens me is stupid suburban women saying things like, &#8220;they need better education and a chance at the College experience&#8221;&hellip;.no we don&rsquo;t have any time for that.Time has come today.</p>

<p>PHILADELPHIA (CBS) – It was a sudden violent attack from out of nowhere for no reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl from that group yells to us &lsquo;run&rsquo; like they were going to kick our [expletive]. At that moment, one kid punches my friend in the face,&rdquo; victim Rajiv Sainath said.</p>

		<p>This is just one more instance of a world-wide phenomenon, to wit, what happens when black Africans reach critical mass without strict white supervision and enforcement of strong behavioral codes.</p>
<p>We can now say that this is a universal law of nature, observable in all cases when black Africans are extended the same civil and other rights as whites and Asians.  They are always poor, always undisciplined, always at the top in crime statistics, and always largely living off the efforts of others.</p>
<p>Of course, there are always exceptions, but the rule is undeniably valid.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not the attitude it&rsquo;s the populace.</p>
<p>If there ever was a white clientelle, you just lost them by being reactive, after the fact.</p>
<p>And as for slapping wrists, why whatever do you mean, in BRA?</p>
<p>Obama &#8216;The Beer Summit&rsquo; POTUS and Eric &#8216;My People&rsquo; Holder will not allow for the flagrant and racist abuse of white privilege in holding any little black feet to the fire.</p>
<p>We are a nation being run and overrun by 13% of it&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Imagine this in 3-5 years time when the reality of the global economy and U.S. debt is one of no more free handouts to the criminally indigent.</p>
<p>We will never survive until we SEPARATE and secede.</p>
