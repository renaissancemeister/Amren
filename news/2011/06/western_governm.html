<h1>Western Governments Are Blamed for Asia&rsquo;s Shortage of Women</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ujala Sehgal, Yahoo! News, June 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In her new book &#8220;Unnatural Selection,&#8221; Science writer Mara Hvistendahl examines how the trend toward choosing boys over girls through sex-selective abortions has spread through the developing world, particularly in Asia. Coining the term &#8220;Generation XY,&#8221; Hvistendahl provides the grim results of sex selection: while the natural sex ratio at birth is 105 boys born for every 100 girls, in India the figure has risen to 112 boys and in China, 121. The Chinese city of Lianyungang actually recorded 163 boys per 100 girls in 2007.</p>
<p>The shortage of women is already giving rise to deep societal problems. New markets have been created for women in Asia, including wedding agencies that arrange marriages between South Korean men and women often from poorer nearby countries like Vietnam, that now account for 11% of all marriages in South Korea. There is also a growing practice of child marriage in China, where wealthier families buy young girls to secure wives for their sons early. {snip}</p>
<p>But what distinguishes Hvistendahl&rsquo;s book from other similar reports is that, as the Guardian notes in a profile today, she &#8220;lays the blame squarely on western governments and businesses that have exported technology and pro-abortion practices without considering the consequences,&#8221; unlike other accounts, that solely basing sex selection on cultural practices.</p>
<p>{snip} Hvistendahl claims western governments actively promoted abortion and sex selection in the developing world, encouraging the liberalization of abortion laws and subsidizing sales of ultrasounds as a form of population control.</p>

		<p>Of course, Whites are responsible for every wrong thing that has ever happened. Didn&rsquo;t you boys and girls read this is your White Initiation Handbook (p. 37 in the current edition) that comes bundled with your first White Privilege check?</p>
<p>The responsibility in no way lies with the Asian governments who actually made the decision.</p>

		<p>So now Westerners are supposed to anticipate the impact of any new technologies they may develop when exported to non-Western nations, and refuse to export those technologies if the anticipated consequences are negative? Is there anything which doesn&rsquo;t get blamed on white people any more?</p>

		<p>And I place the blame squarely on Hvisendahl for being a self-righteous, apologizing, pandering know-it-all catering to the left for her own purposes. Someone in an East Asian government is obviously paying this purpose for propaganda. Why doesn&rsquo;t tgis person write a piece about the Western societies promoting abortion in THEIR OWN populations?</p>
<p>Why are White European, American,Australian, New Zealand &amp; Canadian peoples so slow to pro create these days? Because the social incentives ARE NOT available to them. I say they should do it (no pun intended) anyways, and  bankrupt the system. </p>

<p>Is this supposed to make me cry?  If we&rsquo;re doing this with the secret motive of gradually reducing the population of Asia, then it&rsquo;s one of the rare few sane things we&rsquo;re doing on the international stage.  </p>

		<p>5,000 years before Western medicine developed sterile procedure, antibiotics, ultrasounds and safe and simple abortion procedures asians were killing girl babies at birth.  The chinese dump them in trash heaps, dumpsters, ditches, rivers and woods.  Indian midwives learn the technique of breaking a new born girl babies neck along with the rest of their skills.</p>
<p>This is yet one more reason why I consider White women such a dangerous part of the anti White coalition.  When our own Mothers and daughters betray us, there is no hope for our race.</p>
<p>As for the Vietnamese, Cambodian and Loation girls, life in S. Korea is so much better than life in those countries I doubt that they are coerced.  Mail order brides are a long tradition in most societies, including European and N American.  Couldn&rsquo;t be worse than life in the projects and on welfare with a brood of babies by various boyfriends.</p>
<p>Half the Japanese women who came to America in the 19th and early 20th century were mail order brides.  Many of their families were eager to get rid of them.  Better a hardworking life on a farm or small business than life as a low level prostitute in pre WW2 Japan which would have been the fate of the girls had they stayed in Japan.</p>
<p>Sale of daughters is another wonderful cultural practice of asian societies for the last 5,000 years.  How dare this scandinavian woman disrespect third world non White cultural practices!!!</p>

<p>When you start with a faulty assumption, you end up with the wrong conclusion.</p>
<p>Asia has long favored men. This is nothing new. To claim that the use of western practices like selective abortions is to blame is absurd.</p>
<p><i>There is also a growing practice of child marriage in China, where wealthier families buy young girls to secure wives for their sons early.</i></p>
<p>As crass as it sounds, it seems to me that the imbalance of females may adjust itself through market forces if females are seen as a means to make money. </p>

		<p>China WILL implode within the next 50 years because of this. Their recent Census discovered their birth rate is only 1.5 child/woman, as opposed to 1.8 as commonly reported. And, the female abortion rate is so high that it&rsquo;s like having 1.4 child/woman in a normal sex-ratio country.</p>
<p>China is therefore worse off now than most of Europe.</p>
<p>India might take a while longer, but there will definitely be a collapse in the upper-caste population in Northwest India.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but, my &#8220;own mother and daughter&#8221; have not betrayed me. If yours have, you are likely part of the problem. Most white men and women have been very stupid for the last 100 years or so and we both need to get our act together but, to criticize white women in particular because of some white-trash liberal is not productive to our cause.</p>

		<p>Another wackjob liberal feminist who hates the white man and therefore the white man&rsquo;s country. According to these nuts there is NOTHING in the world that the evil west didn&rsquo;t cause. Of course she probably didn&rsquo;t mention that abortion is MANDATORY in China after the 1st child. That is what has caused China&rsquo;s demographics problem, not the west. I am going to LMAO when we get invaded by China or WW3 starts and moronic libs like this one are starving to death. Maybe then she will realize the jewel the evil white man has created.</p>

<p>In the USA the same is going on like in Germany:<br>
People are thinking instead of believing. If the Media publishes an article the people first think about whether it is true or not and if it is nonsense they write extremely fast and good commentaries about how nonsense the article is.</p>

<p>Wow, this is just too much! Every single country mentioned in the article above has traditionally been killing off their unwanted infant females for centuries, or more. I read an article from somewhere ages ago that put forward the theory that the lack of females in countries such as Pakistan and the surrounding nations is the reason why those countries are full of boy-loving paedophiles.</p>

<p>  Because whites invented airplanes, tanks, bombs, and submarines as well as modern firearms are they responsible for worldwide warfare and mayhem? Throughout history East Asians have been very talented at using and improving Western weapon technologies. </p>
<p>Mara Hvistendahl&rsquo;s viewpoint is totally ridiculous: Chinese Koreans and Indians have to take responsibility for their own cultural preferences and these include the preference for male progeny.  Ms. Hvistendahl&rsquo;s condescending response smacks of the tendency of some American Gender Feminists to blame the world&rsquo;s misfortunes on white males. </p>

<p>&gt; You&rsquo;re right in you implying that male baby preference has historically only been Eastern.  Males were preferred in the West throughout time because they were most often used as laborers, soldiers, and basic cannon fodder.  There has only until recently been a shortage of women anywhere because of this.  After our own CW, women greatly outnumbered men.  Look it up.  Somewhat the same after WW2.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US now has a male birthrate significantly higher than that of females, due mainly to the preference of late-marrying couples wanting a single designer child to be male, and aborting female fetuses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Sources on this claim?  But I could believe it to the extent that fathers want their family name to go on.  That has always been a motive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to manipulate Mama Nature&rsquo;s carefully designed evolutionary balances can and often does come to a bad end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Manipulated Mother Nature is nothing new and it is not &#8220;carefully designed.&#8221;  There have been huge population losses due to war, famine, and disease in the past and Mother Nature always bounces back, with the humans intact and growing again.  It is when were ruin Mother Nature herself that she will not be able to regain homeostasis.  Just today, I see that we are getting set for a massive marine extinction of species.  That is due to acidification of the oceans due to the burning of fossil fuels.  Don&rsquo;t buy it, just wait.</p>
<p>Did it ever occur to anyone that homosexuality, male preference, war and famine is also part of nature&rsquo;s modality for re-balancing?</p>
<p>As for this article by this Leftist Bimbo, China has long had a one child policy that was harshly enforced.  I can&rsquo;t believe that she could be so ill informed and/or think everyone else is that they won&rsquo;t recall that.  Lots of girl babies have been adopted in the U.S. for a couple decades now.  Chinese women used to be the larges group in mail order bride businesses such as &#8220;Cherry Blossoms International.&#8221;  China wants its population to drop because it is untenable now.  Even with the incredible economic growth rate that it has now, most Chinese still live in poverty.  All the wealth in North America and Europe won&rsquo;t be enough to solve that problem if China were to allow families to have 4-5 babies.  This is an idiotic discussion, because anyone half informed individual has to already know this.</p>

<p>WHAT?!  The history and the situation of today, is the exact opposite.  China invented gunpowder, but the Europeans invented the weapons and high tech that changed warfare.  Paper, mechanics, engineering, porcelain (ceramics), China did this stuff first, but Europeans improved them.  Today, China steals technology from the West and replicates it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think its ever been a racial issue as much as a class issue.  The racial aspect has been a distraction for some of us.  But I am happy to see it spread through the third world by any means.  Poor people can&rsquo;t afford abortions, but rich people have always got them. Make it illegal here, women with means will go to Canada, or find people here doing it in &#8220;back allies.&#8221;  Forcing poor women to have babies only increases the likely result of more social services to pay for, and increasing waves of illegal immigrants running from resource wars.  </p>
<p>If we could make it mandatory for welfare moms to have a baby limit that would be great, but we can&rsquo;t do that.  Christianity says that we mustn&rsquo;t, even if common sense says it would be best. If we decide that we want them collectively, then we have to collectively agree to pay for them, raise them, educate them, etc., or else be hypocrites.  If we follow the Christian directive to its heart, then every time a male ejaculates, an ova must be fertilized, just like cattle. But lots of poor people do keep wages low. Hence, the true capitalist manipulation of Christians for their own ends.  This isn&rsquo;t even to mention the crime that such a system causes and perpetuates.  You pay for supporting them, they get cheap labor and you lose your jobs.  Suckers.  </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, this woman is applying her own Leftist Western Christian interpretation of culture. This is purely political piece that ignores well known facts, such as China&rsquo;s long standing One Child Limit.  That was in effect long before China&rsquo;s entry into the world Capitalist marketplaces.  And for good reason; The Chinese government knows how hard it is to control a large population, and has to do it with harsh measures to get an effect.  They know that doubling that huge population would guarantee chaos that no one could control.  The Communist Chinese government ought to be given lots of credit for having the guts to do what obviously had to be done.  The only problem I have seen is that Westerners have provided an outlet for extra babies, which spread the over-breeding Chinese tendencies everywhere.</p>
<p>That any scientist could ignore the statistics of over-population for a political bias disqualifies the use of her letters as a validating source.</p>

		<p>Others have said it here, I will repeat it;  It is not that Whites have too few babies, it is that the rest of the world has too many.  The more we assist the third world in preventing famine, starvation, disease, etc., the larger the disproportion of them to us will be.  Their surpluses natural run to the source of where their salvation has long come from.  Self-righteous, or self-serving Whites acomodate them, arrogantly believing that they can make them to be like us by teaching them our religion and selling them Coca Cola.</p>

		<p>Oh please spare me. Both of my grandfathers died from tobacco usage, does that mean I can blame the American Indians for their deaths, since they introduced tobacco to the White man?</p>

		<p> Follow the logic: Blame the west for the killing of baby girls, the left wing liberal media starts a campaign of guilt against America, our &#8220;dear leaders&#8221; accept guilt and immediately start sending money to affected families in order to repent for the sins of America. The families now claim all abortions are caused by the &#8220;evil wicked west. <br>
 Then they laugh all the way to the bank.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s more likely all the problems in the world are caused by this kind of leftist ideology as it spreads across the globe. That&rsquo;s the last thing anyone would think, however. They have us well trained?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The US now has a male birthrate significantly higher than that of females, due mainly to the preference of late-marrying couples wanting a single designer child to be male, and aborting female fetuses.&#8221;  John</p>
<p>   I don&rsquo;t know where your getting your information &#8220;John&#8221;? The male female ratio is actually declining in Japan and the United States:<br>

<p>There is also &#8220;little evidence that abortion is used for sex selection in the United States&#8221;: <a href="https://reason.com/archives/2001/10/03/sex-selection" rel="nofollow">https://reason.com/archives/2001/10/03/sex-selection</a></p>

		<p>Societies that are relatively gentrified and have strong traditions have ways to cope with surpluses in the male population without the consequence of going to war. Formal and informal clubs (i.e. cafes) can keep men occupied. In the case of China specifically, the labor of the younger men is needed to support an increasingly aging population.</p>
<p>For that matter, as noted, China has the means of procuring wives from abroad for some of their surplus men. As long as these women are East Asian, I doubt that the Chinese leadership will have much concern that they were not born Chinese. China, itself, came into being through the amalgamation of numerous East Asian ethnic groups into a greater Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Still, the imbalance of gender represents a social pathology which must have some consequences even in the most well-behaved society.</p>
<p>Female infanticide is not new in any of these societies. The problem is that contemporary technology is moving the issue into new territory demographically. It is easier to put out of mind a child who never existed except as a &#8220;bump&#8221; and an image on a television monitor than it is to destroy one which is already born and crying for your care.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I sometimes really wonder about the value of some regular posters here when I read badly informed (uninformed) statements like these.&#8221;</p>
<p>  I was talking about modern technologies not ancient ones. Did China invent the submarine, tank, atom bomb and airplane as well?  Didn&rsquo;t they adapt these techonogies from the West? I wonder about some posters myself. <br>

		<p>How is this the West&rsquo;s fault?  If couples in China and India choose to selectively abort girl fetuses using Western technology, this is no different than Asian countries fighting wars against each other using Western technology.  Moreover the selective abortion of girls in India is already a violation of Indian law since passage of the 1994 &#8220;PTND&#8221; Act.  Technology is neutral; how it is used is up to individuals.  Barbed wire was invented for cattle fencing, which made animal husbandry - and therefore improved diet for humans - possible on a larger scale.  It also made the stalemate on the Western Front during World War One so bloody and drawn out.  Since it is cheap, easy to install and can be electrified, it also made the economical operation of modern concentration camps possible.  </p>
<p>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are highly effective insecticides.  They were invented in order to improve crop yields by eliminating insect pests.  They also proved the basis for the development of nerve agents; Tabun was being investigated as an insecticide at IG Farben in 1937 when two of the researchers accidentally poisoned themselves with it.  They took three weeks to recover.  A German law passed in 1935 REQUIRED them to report this to military authorities.</p>
<p>Radio frequency transmission was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1895 to allow wireless communition at long distances.  We have benefited from this invention in many ways, including broadcasts of news and weather information, entertainment, disaster and emergency-relief communications, and so on.  However, during the Rwandan Genocide, radio propaganda was vital to fuelling the killings, as the print media could not reach many Rwandans, due to the low literacy rate there.  The stations &#8220;Radio Rwanda&#8221; and &#8220;RTLM&#8221; were the ringleaders in the media exhortation of Hutus to slaughter Tutsis.  Their carefully-worded broadcast instructions were gleefully followed.</p>
<p>Hvistindahl&rsquo;s statement amounts to the claim that Lucien B. Smith and Joseph F. Glidden are responsible for both the 1914-1918 bloodbath in the trenches, as well as the Holocaust, and that Marconi is responsible for the Rwandan Genocide.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, I am going to blame American Indians for being the first to cultivate tobacco.  Tobacco use is the largest cause of preventable death in the world, and using Hvistindahl&rsquo;s childish reasoning, this is entirely their fault.  Ancient Sumerians and Egyptians were the first to brew alcohol, and thus all the miseries alcohol has inflicted on its users and those around them since them over the last 8000 years must be laid by the West&rsquo;s Hvistindahls squarely at the feet of the Arabs.</p>
<p>The good news here is that Mara Hvistendahl is not a one-issue Chicken Little.  A quick online search shows that when she&rsquo;s not worried about ultrasound scans and abortions, she&rsquo;s fretting about coal mining and coal burning, as well as hydroelectric dams.  How does she expect people to generate adequate amounts of electricity?  Nuclear?  </p>
<p>I suspect each of us already knows the answer to that one.</p>
