<h1>Bill Would Freeze Obama&rsquo;s Power to Grant Illegals Amnesty</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jordy Yager, The Hill, June 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is crafting a bill that would temporarily freeze the Obama administration&rsquo;s power to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The measure is in response to a memo issued by the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last week that approved a broader breadth of discretion for agency officials when considering whether to deport someone through the Secure Communities program.</p>
<p>Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), who is sponsoring the legislation, blasted the memo. He said that under the new guidelines ICE agents could defer the deportations of &#8220;millions of deportable illegal and criminal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the guidelines set forward by the ICE memo, agents could opt to defer on a case-by-case basis the deportation of people in the country illegally who have committed minor crimes or have extraordinary circumstances, such as students who would have been able to gain legal status under the DREAM Act, which stalled in the last Congress.</p>
<p>The 7,000-member ICE labor union has stated its opposition to the memo and issued a unanimous vote of no-confidence of ICE Director John Morton.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Realizing the dim prospects to pass the DREAM Act in this Congress, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) asked Obama last month to delay the deportation of certain illegal immigrants, such as students who have been in the U.S. for at least five years and do not have criminal histories.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Obama is the President, and therefore has total control over Federal law enforcement.  You can&rsquo;t stop someone from not doing something.  Only thing that will work is impeachment (unfortunately, Biden is also open borders), or him not winning re-election (unfortunately, Romney is for open borders).  You can take the hint that any Republican not named Romney is kidding themselves, Romney has too much money and name recognition, all he has to do is walk in a straight line while chewing gum and touching his nose and the nomination is his.</p>

		<p>They better get on it quick. Obama is pushing a revised version of the Dream Act Through Congress today. On his campaign website is posted a photo of him with the caption:</p>
<p>&#8216;I want to sign THE DREAM ACT into law  but I need your help to do the hard work of changing minds and changing votes one at a time&rsquo;</p>
<p>I wonder, is it only a matter of time before we will see the US flag flying under the flag of Mexico. And what will become of us evil, racist,&rsquo;Gringos&rsquo; then?</p>
<p>This kind of thing smacks of treason and I believe that the founders of this country would agree. <br>

<p>John Jay in Federalist 2 declared that we were one people bound by a common heritage (European) a common language (English) and a common religion (protestant Christianity). Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania, serving as a senator in the 39th congress, stated during the debates on the fourteenth amendment that the citizenship clause as proposed by  senator Jacob Howard of Michigan would lead to an &#8216;invasion&rsquo; of American soil by foreign nationals. I think senator Cowan was a prophet.</p>
<p>I believe that we are in the fourth stage of this invasion and like the fourth stage of carcinoma the prognosis is dim indeed.  </p>
