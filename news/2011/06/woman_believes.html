<h1><a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/beach-north-124629279.html">Woman Believes Beach Violence Covered Up</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dick Johnson, NBC Chicago, June 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>City officials said they closed North Avenue Beach on May 30 because of excessive heat, but Amy Schwartz says no one is talking about the excessive violence that prompted her to call 911 that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a fight breaking out on the beach because there&rsquo;s nothing but animals covering this beach today,&#8221; Schwartz phoned into the police. &#8220;What the hell is going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Schwartz said she was walking from Oak Street Beach toward North Avenue Beach on Memorial Day when she witnessed a woman being beaten by a gang of people on the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were being rude and abusive and throwing trash around and defecating,&#8221; Schwartz said. &#8220;The crowd became very animated. They were cheering on the beating and more people joined in, so I kept walking forward. I was afraid I could be next.&#8221;</p>
<p>MULTIMEDIA<br>
Schwartz believes the story of what really happened that day is being purposely downplayed in the name of saving Chicago&rsquo;s summer tourist business and the reputations of the city&rsquo;s new mayor and police superintendent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police presence has been boosted significantly at the beach since Memorial Day.</p>

		<p>The Main Street Media MUST keep this under wraps the best they can. Imagine if the majority of White Americans knew what we knew. It would be over&hellip;&hellip;and the Africans will NOT give up their grip on white society.</p>
<p>Once the truth is known, it means the end of &#8220;multicultural&#8221; society and &#8220;diversity&#8221;. It means segregation. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

		<p>Just one of the many examples of how political correctness is killing our society.</p>
<p>A few generations ago, this type of nonsense would have never been tolerated&hellip;it would have been, ahem, &#8220;stomped out&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Yes, the police might have acted, ahem, &#8220;forcefully&#8221;, but at least the troublemakers would get the message.   </p>

		<p>I lived in Chicago for a number of years and if there was one section of the city I would have described as &#8220;neutral&#8221; it would have to be the beach.  I saw plenty of trouble in that town, but never at the beach.  People mellowed out and left each other alone at the beaches.  Well, it looks like the blacks have put an end to that and I take it as a sign of much bigger problems to come.  North Ave beach was easily the nicest beach, too, made up mostly of yuppies and people from the Gold Coast.  Perhaps it has changed, but I find it hard to believe it has become that ghetto so fast.  </p>

		<p>To Black Swan, oh really? Just HOW would it all &#8220;be over&#8221;? I see a bunch of whiners. I hear a bunch of whiners. In 20 years I&rsquo;ve NEVER seen anyone actually DO anything.</p>
<p>Seriously, I want to know. HOW would it all &#8220;be over&#8221; if only whites &#8220;knew&#8221;? The fact is, they DO know. They move to suburbs, and move again once they become sectioned 8. They abandon whole cities. They tolerate their children losing college spots and themselves being passed over for jobs in favor of the grossly less qualified.</p>
<p>EVERY white ALREADY knows and has for decades! They know there are neighborhoods and whole cities they can&rsquo;t enter in safety. Yet they do NOTHING. I see no way this can change. People are cowards, pure and simple. In fact, I&rsquo;ll be amazed if there is enough courage for the moderator to even post this, such is the extent of the fear.</p>

They claimed they closed THE BEACH because of excessive HEAT.</p>
<p>The beach, because of the water, is cooler than the area surrounded by land. Of course, actually going into the water would be the quickest way to cool off so why deny people access to the water?</p>
<p>The excuse is absurd but I suspect that had to come up with one fast and they didn&rsquo;t have time to think it through.</p>

		<p>The bitter truth is that such despicable acts have been going on for years, but the media largely ignored the episodes with rare exceptions. Some Chicagoans may remember the &#8220;Freaknic&#8221; that occurred in the forest preserves in 1998 and made headlines for several days. These outrages occur regularly, but are seldom, if ever reported. If the newspapers ever bothered to cover such crimes as well as black on black criminal activities, the size of your daily newspaper would triple.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with the blacks who get their jollies by defecating and urinating in public or by vandalizing public washroom facilities?</p>
<p>Interestingly, if one visits the comments section accompanying the original article, one post states that some of the honor students moved North after Rainbow Beach was closed (about eighty-five blocks further South along Lake Michigan). Disturbances at that particular Chicago beach erupted into a fullscale race riot in 1919 that last for several days and which necessitated the mobilization of the state militia.   </p>

		<p> Knowing the views of Mr. McCarthy (guns commit crimes not criminals) and the shifty Ex-Obamaite Rahm Emanuel, I believe in Ms. Schwartz&rsquo;s version of the Memorial Day Holiday events. I can see no reason why she would lie and leave herself open to charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;media sensationalism&#8221;  Federal, state and local government are like the controlled media, always anxious to ignore or downplay racially motivated minority crime.</p>

		<p>The gangbanger neck-tattoo crowd, all black with some Puerto Rican associates, started showing up in the hundreds like an invading army. Of course they created a hostile atmosphere as they strutted around, looking to start trouble. Looking at it I knew trouble was brewing as one could just tell from their body language they weren&rsquo;t there just to swim. I sized it up and then left the area as I felt there was going to be violence.<br>
They don&rsquo;t live in any of the adjacent areas, they travel across town to attack whites. Thanks to the internet people can now find out what the news really is without censorship. </p>

<p>  Of COURSE we all know what&rsquo;s going on. And yes, the tactics we&rsquo;ve implemented thus far are: evasion, and more evasion.<br>
Doing anything more at this point, with an unsympathetic government at the peak of it&rsquo;s power, and the pod-dwelling populace who spend an unhealthy amount of time worrying about &#8220;racism&#8221;, and willing to toss to the lions anyone &#8220;guilty&#8221; of that &#8220;crime&#8221;, would be completely foolhardy.</p>
<p> Our masters have all the time and OUR money to prosecute you or I to the full extent of their many lately-made-up laws. You&rsquo;ll do no one any good rotting away in one the many new gulags springing up all over this nation, like toadstools in the night.</p>
<p>  I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s gone on too long. Remember that it was IN THE 50s that the Fed sicced the military on entire populations for the sake of forced integration. What on earth would they resort to now? Barring a complete collapse, the only other thing I see kicking the pedestal out from under the elected criminals is dissension from within. We&rsquo;re already seeing glimmers of that, with cuts to civil service employees and state and federal employee furloughs. </p>
<p>  When government orcs see their status diminish and their goodie bags going empty, they&rsquo;ll turn tail and run. We can only hope.  </p>

		<p>It is sad but true first come the blacks, then come the problems. They seem to have no interest in living in a civilized world. But Thomas Jefferson and Lincoln told us this many many years ago. To bad we didn&rsquo;t listen.</p>

		<p>Chicago is trying to suppress the reporting of such racially charged incidents and the understaffed police department is being reassigned and redeployed in an effort to avoid a repeat performance by the youths. The &#8220;Taste of Chicago&#8221; food festival has been reinforced by additional police officers, including some undercover police. </p>
<p>The city is also curtailing its Fourth of July Firework shows since those exhibitions draw thugs as well as suburbanites. </p>
<p>According to a friend, whose granddaughter works as lifeguard in suburban Lake County, the ritzy Lake Forest beach was also overrun by intruders on Memorial Day. These well to do suburbs discourage youths from visiting by charging residents for beach passes as a legal mechanism to exclude undesirables. Most of the time this method works, but Memorial Day was an exception to the rule. </p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the surprise? In Africa they defecate in the same sources that supply their drinking water. These people, with some exceptions are primitives and never will be civilized. They are the cancer of society. I feel some sympathy for the few who don&rsquo;t engage in that behavior but sadly the process of sorting out the chaff from the wheat is entirely too risky.

Decades and billions have achieved no <br>

Chicago is known as a danger zone of gang crime.</p>
<p>It is said that Chicagos crime syndicate(s) are still active in the city with some actually holding office.</p>
<p>If gangs have a wide presence, and the decadent decision making policies of local government is cognizable by a wide margin, its logical to propose that criminal activity is diametrically related to how local government is maintained.</p>
