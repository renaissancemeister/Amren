<p>From the video&rsquo;s description:</p>
<blockquote>Many students support affirmative action, in an effort to promote diversity. They argue that race-based preferences &#8220;level the playing field&#8221; for disadvantaged minorities. However, these same students refused to sign our petition to apply such policies to the basketball team. At UC Riverside  &mdash;  where the video was filmed  &mdash;  10/11 active players on the team are African American. Why not use affirmative action to promote diversity there?</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely worth the four and a half minutes to see the students say they support affirmative action, but then stumble and fumble as they try to explain why &#8220;skill&#8221; should be the deciding factor, not race, and that using affirmative action in sports is just &#8220;different:&#8221;</p>

		<p>Actually, by the liberals&rsquo; definition, the sports situation IS different, since they can rightly claim that no one was &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; in having an opportunity to try out.</p>
<p>Where their argument falls flat, of course, is that blacks actually do have every opportunity to concentrate on schoolwork that would qualify them for admissions to college, but they choose not to avail themselves of the opportunity.  Compare the situation of Asian immigrants.<br>

		<p>A better inteview would be this, asked of white students:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe in affirmative action?&#8221;</p>
<p>If they say &#8220;Yes&#8221;, they should either be kicked out of school, to be replaced by a non-white, or else kept out of the next thing for which they are competing (such as grad school), as a direct result of their answer.  They should appreciate the consistency.</p>

		<p>This is why making the facts known regarding race/intelligence is so important.  </p>
<p>These people all believe in merit-based judgement; they just have been taught that blacks do possess that merit and just haven&rsquo;t been given a fair chance to demonstrate it in school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not contradictory, it&rsquo;s what social scientists have been telling people and it&rsquo;s not impossible&hellip; It just isn&rsquo;t true.</p>

		<p>I actually don&rsquo;t like the video, because it&rsquo;s trying to be clever, but it gives an opening to savvy liberals to state their case, i.e. that &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; is artificially hindering well-intentioned blacks from academia, whereas no such racism is hindering whites from basketball.  The video is defeated by that argument, and the liberals win.</p>
<p>The far better argument is this:  Ask the kids if they are willing to give up their spot, right now, so that a non-white can take it.<br>

		<p>Campus liberalism still survives in the form of support for affirmative action, because many whites have never been made aware they&rsquo;ve been subject to lifelong brainwashing and censorship.  </p>
<p>If there is any hope, it is that these kids are intelligent enough to sense the truth, and rebel against the lies they&rsquo;ve been told.</p>

		<p>Blacks of West African ancestry dominate sports such as basketball, football, and the 100/200 meter dash because they have a much higher percentage of quick-twitch muscle fibers.   Hopefully, the science professors at UC Riverside have made these impressionable youth aware of this well established fact.  </p>
<p>Likewise, there is a reason that the brains behind the moon landing suffered from an appalling lack of diversity.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping these young Americans will eventually look at the world rationally and scientifically, rather than through the clouded lens of political correctness.<br>

		<p>It appears these kids were thoroughly indoctrinated by their professors. All seemed to support affirmative racism&hellip;.I mean affirmative action. </p>
<p>I would have asked other questions concerning their support of AA, and maybe added a little hoax of my own. I would have asked them: &#8216;Since you are supportive of affirmative action measures, would you be willing to withdraw from school TODAY, right now, so a minority can have your place in class?&rsquo; I would then produce some phoney, but legitimate looking papers for them to sign, giving up their slot in school so a &#8220;deserving&#8221; minority can take their place. </p>
<p>Somehow I don&rsquo;t think there would be any takers. Young indoctrinated liberals supporting all the &#8220;right&#8221; causes like AA is one thing when it is your kid, my kid or the kid down the street who has to pay the price. But its an entirely different story when it is these kids themselves who would be asked to sacrifice their futures, so a less qualified minority can attend class in their place.  </p>

		<p>I personally don&rsquo;t see affirmative action as fair, at the same time I understand that in a society where there are diverse populations and when one or more of them were discriminated again, the rest would demand some level of justice in the form of compensation. What would happen if we don&rsquo;t succumb ? Lot of unrest would ensure. I think avoiding this unrest while also making up for discrimination are the two reasons behind the whole idea of affirmative action. </p>
<p>I come from a country where AA exits. In my country I am the parallel of a Jew or a white in the US. To give a simple example, I ranked in 200s in 100,000 students in an exam. I had classmates who ranked around 1000 or even 20000 who wouldn&rsquo;t have been if not for AA. </p>
<p>Now coming to why do people perceive sports to be different, I think the reason is simple. Leaving aside the students&rsquo; responses for a moment, sports was never really a profession of status or livelihood in the bygone eras where there was discrimination and when AA was initiated. Sports is more of a money earner during our times. Bottom line is sports wasn&rsquo;t taken seriously as a profession, it is today.</p>

		<p>There is a stronger case for affirmative action in athletics than in academics.  The reason is differential rates of physical maturity: </p>
<p>&#8220;African-American boys showed pubic hair growth earlier than White boys (nine months earlier) and earlier than Mexican-American boys (one year earlier). Pubic hair growth equalized at the end of the development process, with all three groups completing pubic hair growth phases within five months of each other. However, African-American boys started and completed genital development a year earlier than either of the other two groups studied.&#8221; (Journal Summary &#8220;Secondary Sexual Characteristics in Boys,&#8221; original article authored by: Marcia E. Herman-Giddens; Lily Wang; and Gary Koch)</p>
<p>Relatively late-maturing white, Hispanic or Asian children are going to be, on average, smaller, weaker and more awkward than their same-age black peers   &mdash;  - quite unrelated to any average athletic advantage mature blacks may have due to genetics.  This relative delay in physical development, moreover, occurs in the critical years when fundamental athletic skills are acquired.  Many whites, Asians, Hispanics will understandably become discouraged when competing with their more mature same-age black peers.</p>
<p>This may help to explain, as Steve Sailer has suggests, why 8 of the 9 top white players in the National Basketball Association are foreign born AND why the white basketball talent that does exist in America tends to come from high schools very low to negligible black student enrollments.</p>

		<p>I just shake my head in disbelief at these white clowns supporting their own dispossession (and mine) via affirmative action.  In the not too distant future, these fools will be scrambling to save what little is left of the very things they now willingly give away.  If and when racially-conscious whites do secede and create a little haven for themselves somewhere within the current region of the United States, I don&rsquo;t want these idiots to be a part of it.  I don&rsquo;t care what happens to them!!!</p>

		<p>I cannot figure out if Beck is a race realist. He gushes over MLK on TV and then puts out solid awareness pieces like this. The guy has a lot of influence. Surely he has observed the only demographic group that is drawn to his message of values and principles.</p>
<p>My best guess is that Beck doesn&rsquo;t want to offend that big black cameraman that the New York union assigns to film his TV show, six feet from his face. It is probably best that he is leaving FOX. The more of these videos, the better.<br>

		<p>Excellent video. I hope all those who support AA in acedemics and the professions, (but support &#8220;talent&#8221; in sports) will someday have to look up from the operating table and see AA doctor Jamal &#8220;The Dunkman&#8221; Jackson trying to guess which one is the scalpel as he is preparing to do their surgery.</p>

		<p>These young adults are so inarticulate that I want to cry. Even the young man carrying the petition can&rsquo;t hold a conversation without interjecting, &#8220;Like, you know, basically&hellip;&#8221; throughout his speech. On top of that, these students all end their sentences as though they were questions. Someone needs to teach these young people how to speak like strong, confident adults who believe in the truth of their own words. &#8220;The Voice of the Neuter is Heard Throughout the Land.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We are doomed. If this is the youth that will be our future, we are doomed. Not only have they swallowed the PC/it&rsquo;s-all-good agenda hook, line and sinker, their time in school has obviously been a waste as they cannot seem to form a cogent thought. You can almost smell the gears burning&hellip;</p>
<p>Education is inevitably indoctrination. That is its basic purpose, to acclimate and integrate the young into their culture. But being &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221; we no longer have a culture, so our education has become a confusing mishmash. The apparent repudiation of traditional western culture (aka &#8220;White Culture&#8221;) has created a vacuum that is now filled by titillation and self infatuation. Education has become entertainment. The value of a course is not now in how much it teaches you but how good it makes you feel. Or in how much it validates those you, as a White, have &#8220;oppressed.&#8221; Black is white and up is down. We are doomed.</p>

		<p>Not a bad video, but what would make it really interesting is for the interviewer to go to a campus where the basketball team is already currently 90% white, and try to get the students to sign a proposal to ship in black basketball players to even out the team to 50% black. Then he could go around and propose making the team 90% black, in order to &#8220;make up for past discrimination.&#8221; It would be very interesting to see how many students would go along with this. If the question was worded properly, I&rsquo;ll bet the majority would  &mdash;  except for those on the basketball team, of course!</p>
<p>It would also be interesting for the interviewer to ask the students to define &#8220;affirmative action.&#8221; Who knows what kind of crazy ideas they have about it. Perhaps something for someone like Craig Bodeker to tackle?</p>

		<p>This was very hard to watch even though alot of Whites I come in contact with are just as clueless. I swear, sometimes I literally feel as if I live among the living dead or the body snatchers and I&rsquo;m the only human left, thats the best way I know how to describe it. By personal experience, these White people cannot\will not see whats right in front of them and cannot\will not think rational even with FACTS! And Whites are the ONLY race that this seems to happen to, while non-Whites openly promote their own - with the SUPPORT of Whites! These Whites will be the first they slaughter when the sshhhhtuff hits the fan because to them it will be unexpected. I will go to my grave never understanding this.<br>
And to the White useful idiot who said - &#8220;why would you kick out the best players on the team just to have more Whites&#8221; I say - isn&rsquo;t that what happens academically, kicking out the best players to have more blacks? I&rsquo;d also like to ask him that if he believes AA is such a good thing, then why doesn&rsquo;t he immediately drop out so a more deserving &#8216;underprivledged&rsquo; ghetto &#8216;yuf&rsquo; can take his place?</p>

		<p> What a bunch of mush-headed White kids! Not one of them could perceive, or was willing to say, that affirmative action if carried to its logical conclusion, should include athletics. Not a one had enough nerve to say they opposed affirmative action. Or maybe they were afraid to say so   &mdash;   peer pressure you know.</p>
<p> So, it appears that the average White college kid nowadays is either terribly brainwashed about this issue; or they&rsquo;re unwilling, or afraid, to be honest about their true feelings. It&rsquo;s for sure that there are many White college students who DO NOT agree with affirmative action. But that&rsquo;s not something you say out loud on liberal campuses nowadays.</p>

 IF Whites rise up against the new discriminating Majority (think there will be AA for Us?) they will not crush us. If we have the will to rise up We Will Win (to steal an old Wobblie slogan). I say it&rsquo;s easier to &#8220;correct&#8221; things now. </p>

<p>There is a third, more important and more insidious reason for AA:  It is being used to dispossess Whites   &mdash;   by denying us entry to top-tier universities or ivies (and thus the prestige that comes from such), to prevent us from salary-enhancing career advancement, to deny us SBA loans to open businesses  &mdash;   at the same time using the satanic progressive tax code to strip us of our wealth and property.  Wealth, money and property handed over to hoards of non-Whites to expand their population while ensuring that we limit ours.  There are already 100 million non-Whites in our midst, their population expanding and overtaking us.</p>
<p>A top-tier university or ivy lends credence to one&rsquo;s work   &mdash;   which one carries more weight with the press and government?  A professor at Harvard or one from Long Beach State?  How many times has the much-discredited Gould been noted prominently as a &#8220;Harvard professor&#8221; by the NYT? Or the recipient of a &#8220;Genius Award?&#8221; How dare <b>you</b> question a Harvard professor!! (no matter that he is wrong).  Who in the hell do you think you are questioning a great Harvard professor, you are nothing but a kulak!!</p>
<p>Whites must start looking at AA  NOT a method to redress past discrimination, as an anodyne for &#8220;White racial oppression&#8221; or to give blacks a &#8220;leg up&#8221;,   &mdash;   or any other government lie   &mdash;    it is being used by hostile government elites as a weapon against Whites  &mdash;   a very powerful weapon in the government&rsquo;s arsenal and it is a part of their triangulation against Whites, the ultimate goal of which is White genocide.</p>
<p>Blacks are merely low IQd tools, battering rams and useful idiots, playing a losing roll in the main theater of this war, which is White destruction.</p>
<p>Is there anything else that matters?  Please, everyone, start looking at it from that POV, from a White perspective.  A genocide is being perpetuated against us in our homelands   &mdash;   all of them.  Is this the world we wish to leave to our precious children?  </p>

<p>&#8220;I have given my life to try to bring unto them the advantages which our civilization must offer, but I have become well aware that we must retain this status; white, the superior, and they the inferior; for whenever a white man seeks to live among them as their equal, they will either destroy him or devour him, and they will destroy all his work; and so for any existing relationship or for any benefit to this people let white men from anywhere in the world who would come to help Africa remember that you must continually retain this status; you the master, and they the inferior, like children that you would help or teach. Never fraternize with them as equals, never accept them as your social equals ; or they will devour you; they will destroy you.&#8221;- Dr. Albert Schweitzer, winner of the 1952 Nobel Prize for peace, in his 1961 book, From My African Notebook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Relatively late-maturing white, Hispanic or Asian children are going to be, on average, smaller, weaker and more awkward than their same-age black peers  &mdash;  quite unrelated to any average athletic advantage mature blacks may have due to genetics.

<p>This is very correct sir!<br>
I recall all too well what it was like being between 12-18 years old in public school with same-age blacks. <br>
It was a dismal time for white kids, who were almost all scraggly, shorter, and awkward. Meanwhile the blacks were bigger, already sexually aware (probably as early as 10 or 11 years), stronger, had deeper voices, etc. </p>
<p>What did this entail: a proto-form of social terrorism. <br>
The social engineers already knew this long before forced integration. Integration was like putting Piranhas in a goldfish tank. </p>
<p>Blacks became defacto enforcers, bullies, celebrities, and Casanovas. This naturally included sexual liberties with all the females. <br>
Meanwhile everyone else did their best to stay under their radar, lest they were to end up in a swarm-beating, or with a table over their head. </p>
<p>The effects of this upon probably millions of impressionable young people during such formative years is surely damaging to the white ethos. </p>
<p>Any non-black parent who willingly sends their child to such an environment needs to undergo shock-therapy.   <br>

		<p>I attended UCR a few years ago and the quality of responses in this video is pretty much par for the student body - many of the race-based student groups, and a few of the religious ones, are so fervent and verbally violent that most students, especially white ones, will simply nod and allow their opinions to be led from &#8220;everyone deserves a fair shot&#8221; into &#8220;whites are evil&#8221;, rather than face down what amounts to a mob of angry students screaming that you&rsquo;re a racist. The school mounts no opposition or discussion of the subject - in fact the Ethnic Studies department actively promotes this ideology and stamps down on any dissent with protests arranged by the professors. The result is that very few students, as evidenced by this video, have any idea of what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>

<p>Sounds a lot like a protection scam to me.  The difference being, of course, that it&rsquo;s not the minorities wielding the sword, as you suggest, but the government.  Left to their own devices, whites would do precisely what they did for centuries before the feds took the side of the blacks; sort the blacks out PDQ.

<p>So, no, AA doesn&rsquo;t fly as a way for whites to protect themselves from blacks.  It <i>does</i> work as a euphemism for white payments into a fedgov/black protection racket, though.</p>

		<p>What is interesting a few years ago the American Olympian basketball team played an Italian team. The American team was composed of professional NBA players and they were all black. I think Kobe Bryant was on the team and many well known names. The Italian team was smaller than the American team and they were all white. Basketball is not a major sport in Europe. Their sport is soccer. Therefore, the Italian team had another disadvantage, and that was experience. The result of the game was interesting. The Italian team trounced the American team by something like 86 to 43. Yet, the American team was composed of well known black professional players that play basketball for a living.

<p>I actually don&rsquo;t agree with this.  Blacks are disadvantaged.  Intellectually disadvantaged.  Many could perform better in school if they worked harder, but they will never perform as well as Whites or Asians, no matter how hard they try.  Someone with an average IQ and a great attitude can graduate college and get a decent, or even good job.  He won&rsquo;t, however, become an engineer, or a theoretical physicist, or a cancer doctor.  It just ain&rsquo;t gonna happen.</p>
<p>I could become a much better tennis or golf player if I worked harder.  But I know I&rsquo;ll never actually be good in either sport, so I don&rsquo;t even try.  I think many Blacks feel the same way about academics.</p>
<p>If we want to be intellectually honest, we can&rsquo;t assert both that racial differences are real, and that Blacks are entirely at fault for not performing as well as Whites in a White society.  You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.     </p>

<p>Of course heavy social pressure is one of the reasons why people respond with politically correct answers such as those seen in the video above.  This type of automated response is exactly what Jared Taylor has been working hard at attempting to undo in many people with this website.</p>
<p>If you read the comments on the YouTube video you will see that the overwhelming majority of people agree with the point of view of Amren.  In fact, I would say most do.  It is the fact that through a very carefully planned and deliberate propaganda campaign that merely merely *think* that people don&rsquo;t agree with the overarching view of Amren.  Once more and more people realize this it will have a domino effect and political correctness will collapse like so many other failed social policies that came before it.</p>
<p>As for a response on camera, pointing out racial double standards or making generic comments such as &#8220;I feel it is important for the best doctor to get hired for everyone&rsquo;s safety and hiring policies should be based on merit&#8221;, etc, are hardly controversial and will only get a person labeled racist by organizations as out of touch with reality as the SPLC.  To the rest of the world, such a response would hardly be controversial at all.  More young people need to have the courage to follow in Jared Taylor&rsquo;s footsteps.  This will happen, sooner or later, I can guarantee it.</p>

<p>Generic statements are definitely the best way to say what you truly think without being blatant.  Racial double standards,no.  </p>
<p>The problem is &#8220;controversial&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221; is an ill-defined line,especially on liberal campuses.  Even subltle or benign remarks or actions that arent truly &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;controversial&#8221; can cost people valuable social connections and employment options.</p>
<p>Liberals are a little too trigger-happy when it comes using the racist label.   </p>
<p>People can be marked forever by a racist label in online media even if their action or comment wouldn&rsquo;t be considered &#8220;controversial&#8221; by the standards here.  </p>
<p>Even subtle remarks can easily be altered by gossipers to mean something else entirely.  Not supporting AA is easily seen as supporting &#8220;racist practices&#8221; by liberals who think minorities have the merit but not a level playing field.</p>
<p>I think these students were smart in playing it safe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the commenters in the YouTube section are a good representation of the population as a whole.</p>

&#8220;I actually don&rsquo;t like the video, because it&rsquo;s trying to be clever, but it gives an opening to savvy liberals to state their case, i.e. that &ldquo;institutional racism&rdquo; is artificially hindering well-intentioned blacks from academia, whereas no such racism is hindering whites from basketball.</p>
<p>Nonsense. To libtards, &ldquo;disparate impact&rdquo; (10/11 on the team black) is ipso facto evidence of discrimination/racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anon. #50</p>
<p>Just curious. I assume that &#8220;libtards&#8221; is a combination of liberal and retards but couldn&rsquo;t it also be a combination of liberal and bastards?<br>
Either way I like it.<br>

		<p>&#8220;blacks actually do have every opportunity to concentrate on schoolwork that would qualify them for admissions to college, but they choose not to avail themselves of the opportunity. Compare the situation of Asian immigrants&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks are disadvantaged. Intellectually disadvantaged&hellip;If we want to be intellectually honest, we can&rsquo;t assert both that racial differences are real, and that Blacks are entirely at fault for not performing as well as Whites in a White society. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
Not everyone here insists that African Americans are innately disadvantaged when it comes to smarts. Perhaps only a small minority of very loud AmRen posters believe that. It&rsquo;s what gives this website it&rsquo;s charm. That racial differences are real is no reason to automatically assume whites are more intelligent (even if it&rsquo;s possible or even likely). It&rsquo;s more likely true that those physically superior will also be intellectually superior as well. Besides&hellip; why can&rsquo;t we have our cake and eat it too - even if only on this virtual website, why can&rsquo;t we have it both ways? Women and people of color do every single minute of their lives. </p>

		<p>I support Affirmative Action for Africans since without it most would never get into college.  If we relied on their academic intelligence, and not their skin color, they, for the most part, would not get in.</p>
<p>As for white athletes. Too bad. They aren&rsquo;t as good as Africans so they should just shut up and apply to Med school.</p>
