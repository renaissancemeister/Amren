<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Olympic Delivery Authority wants the economic and social benefits of the regeneration of the area, and the design and build of the Olympic Park and venues, to have a positive impact on local communities and different parts of the UK. An example of how we are achieving this is ensuring our procurement process is transparent, fair and open to a wider range of diverse suppliers.</p>
<p>The way that we are recruiting and managing employees is fair, and helps to promote equal opportunities to all and eliminate discrimination in the workplace. We are working with partner organisations to encourage women, black, Asian and minority ethnic people, and disabled people, to train and apply for jobs in construction and other areas where they have traditionally been under-represented. {snip}</p>
<p>What we build for 2012 and beyond will be inclusive for people of all cultures, faiths and ages, and fully accessible to disabled people with a wide range of impairments. We will also provide an accessible transport network that will give everyone the opportunity to enjoy the Games, as well as leave a lasting legacy for equality and inclusion. </p>
<p>We recognise the diversity of the population of the UK, London and the five Host Boroughs and are committed to realising the advantages of this diversity in delivering our programme. We are already engaging with and involving the local communities to help us deliver the most accessible and inclusive Games.</p>

<p>Are you a Whitey and want a job? Too bad- not wanted!  These declarations of preferences for anybody but straight White men should be grounds for a massive anti-discrimination class actions lawsuit.   They employer is actively discriminating against White by selectively encouraging only &#8220;the other&#8221; to apply, thus discouraging Us from applying.  That is vile, despicable, pernicious, toxic hate speech, because it legitimizes hostile and dangerously anti-white environments and policies.  It also promotes violence against Whites, because if they aren&rsquo;t wanted for employment, there must be something so wrong with them that the deserve a good beating to knock some of that unearned White skin privilege off of them.<br>

		<p>I wish they would cancel these stupid &#8220;games&#8221;. Honestly, I am yet to see an argument as to why it&rsquo;s in any way entertaining to watch such futilities as the contest to see which country imported the fastest Africans.

<p>The diversity nonsense is sadly typical of the way these games are being run here. London, once proud centre of the great British Empire is now a hell pit filled with the Third World and with a standard of living to match. You&rsquo;ll all get a chance to see it when the cameras roll into town, with excited interviews featuring &#8220;Londoners&#8221; called Muhammad Muhammad Akbar Muhammad and Sheneequa Shabazz X.</p>
<p>I can only imagine what the Chinese thought at the handover at the end of the Beijing olympics when we had some &#8220;urban&#8221; group shucking and jiving and a girl presented as British who was in every way a Third Worlder.</p>
<p>The best I can say is that I hope the whole experience, from futility and cost of the silly events to the crime and degeneracy inflicted on visitors by &#8220;Londoners&#8221;, serves as a warning to other civilised nations.</p>

		<p>This sort of sick-bag verbiage is now so stale and banal that it is almost beyond parody. I sometimes wonder how anyone can bring themselves to write it - in fact they probably don&rsquo;t, they just press a button on a computer marked &#8220;standard equal opps. statement&#8221; and out it spews.</p>
<p>As white Brits have been almost completely cleansed from this part of London over the past forty years the benefits for them from the twelve billion so far plowed into this farce by the British taxpayer will be zero. </p>

<p>How is this FAIR? They promote equal opportunity to ALL, but openly give help to every group but Whites! They include women on the list but don&rsquo;t kid yourselves, they don&rsquo;t mean WHITE women! </p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more Tom. The Olympics is the only time you&rsquo;ll get an Australian yelling with excitment at a gold-medal win in javelin or discus;  the term &#8216;futilities&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t even begin. Then add in a whole lot of artificially created diversity to make the whole very expensive and pointless exercise even more futile.</p>

I still remember 40+ years on,  a old short story I read as a kid. It was called &#8220;The Mile Relay&#8221; or some such. It was about a talented Edwardian  champion who is framed by an unscrupulous and jealous educator to have appeared to have been cheating because his track shoes were altered  and replaced before the big race. But the hero`s sense of fair play, sportsmanship and camraderie render the allegations mute when he comes to a stop on the final stretch as his competition stumbles on a turn and goes down. The hero pulls up, dusts the other boy off and hands him his baton before both boys complete the final lap after the  other youngster has a moment to shake off his injury. The crowd cheers both boys, and the track coach quietly convinces the dean to resign because he has the goods on him, as a boy who was blackmailed to be in  on the deception comes clean after witnessing the hero`s civility&hellip; I`ve never forgotten the feeling I had after reading it. It was like taking a clean hot shower in the mind.</p>

		<p>London&rsquo;s Olympic Games are little more than a property(real estate)scam,the true aim being the creation of an islamic overspill suburb.There is a pre-fabricated temporary feel about most of the sporting venues,and it wouldn&rsquo;t take a great deal of work to convert an unwanted velodrome into the oft-mooted &#8220;super&#8221; Mosque that the New Order is so keen to erect.  </p>

The ONLY ONE of these groups that should be of ANY concern to British government, are (native born) disabled people. (And frankly, even they probably won&rsquo;t make great construction workers.) </p>
<p>The rest are just foreigners, who should be entitled to NOTHING   &mdash;   except maybe a one-way plane ticket back home. </p>
