			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), June 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Kuwaiti woman who once ran for parliament has called for sex slavery to be legalised  &mdash;  and suggested that non-Muslim prisoners from war-torn countries would make suitable concubines.</p>
<p>Salwa al Mutairi argued buying a sex-slave would protect decent, devout and &#8216;virile&rsquo; Kuwaiti men from adultery because buying an imported sex partner would be tantamount to marriage.</p>
<p>And she even had an idea of where to &#8216;purchase&rsquo; these sex-salves  &mdash;  browsing through female prisoners of war in other countries.</p>
<p>The political activist and TV host even suggested that it would be a better life for women in warring countries as the might die of starvation.</p>
<p>Mutairi claimed: &#8216;There was no shame in it and it is not haram&rsquo; (forbidden) under Islamic Sharia law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave the example of Haroun al-Rashid, an 8th century Muslim leader who ruled over an area covered by modern-day Iran, Iraq and Syria and was rumoured to have 2,000 concubines.</p>
<p>Mutairi recommended that offices could be opened to run the sex trade in the same way that recruitment agencies provide housemaids.</p>
<p>She suggested shopping for prisoners of war so as to protect Kuwaiti men from being tempted to commit adultery or being seduced by other women&rsquo;s beauty.</p>
<p>&#8216;For example, in the Chechnyan war, surely there are female Russian captives,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;So go and buy those and sell them here in Kuwait. Better than to have our men engage in forbidden sexual relations.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Her unbelievable argument for her plan was that &#8216;captives&rsquo; might &#8216;just die of hunger over there&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She insisted, &#8216;I don&rsquo;t see any problem in this, no problem at all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In an attempt to consider the woman&rsquo;s feelings in the arrangement, Mutari conceded that the enslaved women, however, should be at least 15.</p>
<p>Mutairi said free women must be married with a contract but with concubines &#8216;the man just buys her and that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s enough to serve as marriage.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Her remarks, made in a video posted on YouTube last month and carried by newspapers in the Gulf states in recent days, have sparked outrage in cyber-space from fellow Kuwaitis and others in the wider region.</p>
<p>&#8216;Wonder how Salwa al Mutairi would&rsquo;ve felt if during the occupation (of Kuwait) by Iraqi forces, she was sold as &#8216;war booty&rsquo; as she advocates for Chechen women,&rsquo; tweeted Mona Eltahawy.</p>
<p>Another tweeter, Shireen Qudosi, told Mutairi &#8216;you&rsquo;re a disgrace to women everywhere&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For Muna Khan, an editor at the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television station, the &#8216;icing on the cake&rsquo; of Mutairi&rsquo;s &#8216;preposterous views&rsquo; was her assertion that her suggestions do not conflict with the tenets of Islam.</p>
<p>Mutairi said that during a recent visit to Mecca, she asked Saudi muftis  &mdash;  Muslim religious scholars  &mdash;  what the Islamic ruling was on owning sex slaves. They are said to have told her that it is not haram.</p>
<p>The ruling was confirmed by &#8216;specialized people of the faith&rsquo; in Kuwait, she claimed.</p>
<p>&#8216;They said, that&rsquo;s right, the only solution for a decent man who has the means, who is overpowered by desire and who does not want to commit fornication, is to acquire jawari.&rsquo; Jawari is the plural of the Arabic term jariya, meaning &#8216;concubine&rsquo; or &#8216;sex slave&rsquo;.</p>
<p>One Saudi mufti supposedly told Mutairi: &#8216;The context must be that of a Muslim nation conquering a non-Muslim nation, so these jawari have to be prisoners of war.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Concubines, she argued, would suit Muslim men who fear being &#8216;seduced or tempted into immoral behaviour by the beauty of their female servants&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The idea is silly, it would mean Kuwait would have to OPENLY LEGALIZE slavery again. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is a &#8220;sex slave&#8221; or any other type of slave, same difference.</p>
<p>That will never happen, way way to much worldwide condemnation when it comes to legalized slavery these days.</p>

		<p>Typical muslim hypocrisy. The same people that condemn homosexuality (making it a capital offense in some islamic countries, e.g.)regularly  partake in buggery and pederasty (the dancing boys of the Taliban, again, e.g.).  It has been regularly reported that muslims are the biggest viewers of pornography in the world.  And was there any doubt that at least some of the 19 9/11 murderers were deeply sexually repressed?  And, the idea of paradise for devout muslims is what, access to 72 virgins; in other words, lots of sex, not &#8220;romance&#8221; or &#8220;love&#8221; but unlimited physical, animal action. What a spiritual religion.  One wonders if to be a muslim one must be so disconnected from reality as to be mentally ill. </p>

		<p>I friend of mine went to school in Kuwait. According to him, Kuwaiti men are not deperived of sex partners as long as there are goats and donkeys available. This is not a joke nor an attempt at being condesending. He told me that he stumbled upon and witnessed this type of behavior while out riding a dirt bike. True story. It appears to be an acceptable (but hush-hush)practice because of the lack of willing female partners. Ask some veterans returning from the middle-east.</p>

		<p>The one thing I can say is this.  She was trying to give her citizens what they want.  And for others saying that this would bring back slavery so it is wrong, remember who condemns slavery, the West.  Slavery is still practiced from the levant to Asia and most of Africa.  When whites go so will this taboo.  Plus, it isn&rsquo;t slavery if it is done to whites, its righting the wrongs of the past.</p>

		<p>If you look at the timeline for the abolition of slavery at wikipedia you will find the last nations to do so are all Muslim theocracies. If you follow the links for those countries you will find most have abolished slavery in law but not in practice. And when did Kuwait abolish (in law) their kafeel system? February 2010.</p>
<p>Islam is usually rendered as &#8216;submission&rsquo; but I can think of another word that might be a better English translation. </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s trying to legalize what is <i>already</i> happening. Under the &#8220;Kafeel&#8221; system foreign workers are imported - mostly from poor Asian countries such as the Philipines and Bangladesh. Once in Kuwait, they basically have no protections and the justice system little interest in crimes against them. Many of the domestic servants such as maids and housekeepers are physically and sexually abused. When they get tired of it they escape to their embassies. But there are rarely any consequences for the abuse. The abuser just imports another to replace her. To let you know how widespread the abuse is, over 2/3 of the people living in Kuwait are foreign born workers. Though this number also includes male laborers as well.</p>

		<p>This article is very informative.  All this time I was thinking <br>
that the only beneficiaries of Islam were Muslim men.  Now I know better.  And whoever says beauty is only skin deep, well, perhaps, but ugliness can rot the soul all the way to the bone.  </p>
<p>In the photograph, this Salwa al Mutairi looks to be a deeply scarred woman, strikingly reminiscent of how Darth Vader of Star Wars looked like when his mask was finally removed just before he died in the movie:  Awful and rather sickly.  If this repulsive woman is happily married, there seems no question that any form of adultery her husband could get away with, whether it be legalization of sex slavery or the other alternatives listed that also no doubt weigh heavy on her hubby&rsquo;s mind, they could well keep her marriage together, and what better way for her to know exactly what is going on that to own a family sex slave.  So, too, would the practice of wearing a burka help her.  So would bigamy.  So would the promise of 72 virgins to martyrs.  All these things help ugly, rotten-hearted Muslim women.  </p>

<p>Oh really? That&rsquo;s why Muslims invades Slavic nations such as my father&rsquo;s native Ukraine and my grandmother&rsquo;s native Russia, to kidnap girls and women and force them to be sex slaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, in the Chechnyan war, surely there are female Russian captives,&rsquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is why Russians kill Muslims without mercy, compunction or restraint when their children and families are threatened by these barbarians&hellip;&hellip;.ever wonder why the capital of Chechnya is called Grozny? That in Russian literally means terrible, and the Chechens have murdered, raped and enslaved Russian women for centuries among other atrocities they committed against my grandmother&rsquo;s ancestors.</p>
<p>&#8220;One Saudi mufti supposedly told Mutairi: &lsquo;The context must be that of a Muslim nation conquering a non-Muslim nation, so these jawari have to be prisoners of war.&#8221;</p>
<p>There you have it, one example of what they really think of us, and why we must fight Islam, to the death literally or even with nuclear strikes against them to keep us from being enslaved. A non-Muslim enslaved by these people suffers in ways Americans can barely conceive of, but Slavs like me are well aware of. We must not allow this to happen in our lands. We must punish sex trafficking against our people harshly, and without mercy. The only thing they understand are piles of corpses. And we must stop the Islamification of western nations, because blonde, fair skinned and beautiful women and girls especially are going to be targted by these fiends. They are obsessed with red heads as well, all the more reason to expel them from our lands. They have their women, they have no right to ours. What an evil, hideous woman, no wonder even other Muslims went ballistic.</p>

		<p>  There is nothing in the Holy Koran against this practice. In fact, Muslim men have traditionally been allowed concubines or unbelieving sex slaves. Of course, slavery is not condemned in the Holy Bible either. If this form of slavery has been widely banned in Middle Eastern countries, it has been by the civil, rather than the religious authorities. I would say that the views of Salwa al Mutairi are completely in compliance with Islamic Sharia Law. </p>

		<p>Belief in Islam is often a kind of self embraced intellectual retardation. It&rsquo;s also a perfect system for lower IQs. Its adherents have historically produced very little contribution to modern culture, society, or science. You won&rsquo;t be hearing about the Saudi Arabian space program anytime soon, for example.  The woman quoted is simply of less than (western) average intelligence- it literally sounds like the reasoning of a child. </p>

<p>You couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong, dear.  Islam has it&rsquo;s own law process and typically ignores the outside.  A typical Arabian house is huge and NO ONE can get inside to find the captive women who cannot ever leave.</p>
<p>The reason that she mentions Russian sex slaves is that there are already many of them as well as Ukrainian sex slaves all over the region, from Turkey, the Balkans, to Saudi Arabia and all points where Arabs inhabit.  I saw a recruitment poster for Russian women &#8220;dancers&#8221; for clubs in Qatar when I was last in the Balkans.  Of course, those who understand know that these women are quickly turned into slaves.  their passports are seized and they are told, beyond their own rapes and beatings that their families will be killed if they try to escape.  We also know that this has even occurred inside the U.S.  I have heard reports from The Ukraine that there are hardly any young women left between 17-25.  An entire generation is missing. </p>
<p>She does do us a favor in one sense;  She helps revive the Chivalric notion that says that women must be protected, and NOT part of a offensive military.  The origin of military is defense and aimed at protecting, primarily women and children from exploitations like these.</p>
<p>Historically, Islam is NOTHING but a slave trading coalition, given a holy excuse and validation.  </p>
<p>If you Google Circassian Beauties, you will be able to locate the history of slave capturing in the Caucasus region of Europe from ancient times.  </p>

		<p>My first thought:  Is this an admission of a demographic crisis in progress?</p>
<p>If you need a lot of kids in a hurry, polygamy is a way to get there.  Choosing Western women would help legitimize a deeply held inferiority complex in SWA males, both for the &#8216;conquest&rsquo; of the ethnic identity itself and the real benefits to national IQ and pulchritude.</p>
<p>Shortages of women are also what happens when you create tribal cultures that control inheritance of limited family businesses through restricted marriage access and multiple wives.</p>
<p>Mind you, it can&rsquo;t have been too bad as the Arab population of SWA has gone from 80 million in 1950 to 320 million in 2003 (_Eurabia_) and still can&rsquo;t seem to send out their social refuse to Europe and The West, fast enough but that can also mean a lost youth segment in the population which is hard to replace.</p>
<p>The obvious problem with Mz Mutairi&rsquo;s logic is the same one inherent to scalping in the bad ol&rsquo; days of the Wild West.  Someone sets a head bounty for Chiricahua or Comanche like they were dealing with wolves and once the hair is off the head, nobody knows the difference between the predator and some poor victim group of Hualapi or Hopi.</p>
<p>In Chechnya for instance, kidnapping for ransom is already THE NUMBER ONE means of income in some areas and it is _not_ restricted to that benighted state but has spread across the whole region.</p>
<p>If a kidnapper says a child he stole from N/S Ossetia (scene of Beslan, 380 dead _children_), Dagestan or Georgia is a &#8216;POW&rsquo;, it won&rsquo;t matter if she&rsquo;s 13 or 19, a member of a warring faction or just some kid snatched at 0D30 from the house of her slaughtered parents.</p>
<p>Money will be the sole driver of the trade and human lives will be _bid upon_, like EBay, with young woman&rsquo;s family likely losing to a rich Arab.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The demoniac always reveals himself without understanding himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would venture that the so-called outrage by muslims is really their way of saying, shut up you fool, you are giving the game away!</p>
<p>We need to understand that Islam has a long tradition of enslaving &#8220;captives,&#8221; often going on raids for that express purpose. Muslims were the goto guys for slaves throughout history. So where&rsquo;s the surprise? Their so-called religion hasn&rsquo;t budged from its 7th century roots and is clearly and undeniably deeply seeped in the barbarism and ignorance of those times. Tom #17 hit the nail on the head when he said &#8220;it literally sounds like the reasoning of a child.&#8221; That is because it IS the reasoning of an underdeveloped and regressive &#8220;culture&#8221; - a culture that would be child-like were it not for its propensity for violence and barbarism.</p>
<p>Islam and the islamization of the world is the greatest threat to freedom and civilization since the Cold War and the threat of nuclear holocaust. It is a far greater pernicous threat than the Soviets ever were. We are fools to let them roam amongst us while they plot our destruction and enslavement.</p>

		<p>I am outraged that she explicitly brought up Russian women! I had wondered about the races of women prisoners of war, but assumed she was talking about Darfur. All she cares about is that Muslim &#8220;men&#8221; do not break their faith. She completely disregards the women who are held captive. If there were an all-out war in this country and I was captured, I would kill any Muslim &#8220;man&#8221; that bought me.</p>

<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t notice that the first time but you are VERY correct. Something is odd about that. Devout Muslim women do not pile on the make-up, sheesh the really devoute don&rsquo;t even pluck their eyebrows. She is a rabble rouser!<br>

		<p><i>My first thought: Is this an admission of a demographic crisis in progress?</i></p>
<p>Possibly. Arab/Muslim birth rates are indeed collapsing. Although they&rsquo;re still higher than whites, the days of rampant Arab reproduction are decisively over.</p>

		<p>Islam has no problem at all with slavery. Never did. The &#8220;prophet&#8221; was a slaveowner.</p>

		<p>I remember watching a television documentary featuring the habits of young Kuwaiti men.</p>
<p>  Apparently most of them are seriously overweight and suffering from such attendant disorders as diabetes.  According to the documentary young Kuwaiti men like nothing better than gorging themselves on American fast food, burgers, fried chicken, pizza, you name it.  In their big cars they drive to drive-thru establishments where &#8216;hot and cold running&rsquo; Pakistanis come and collect their orders.  Sitting in their cars the Kuwaitis feast and gorge themselves.</p>

		<p>By the looks of her, I&rsquo;d say this Salwa al Mutairi is looking forward to having a go at blonde sex slave herself.</p>
<p>The tales of foreign women tricked into captive whoredom are true. Many a Thai woman has accepted a job as a housemaid in the Middle East  &mdash;  no deception involved, as long as your definition of &#8220;housemaid&#8221; includes catering to the sexual whims of every single member of the family, the women not excepted!</p>

<p>The one thing I can say is this. She was trying to give her citizens what they want. And for others saying that this would bring back slavery so it is wrong, remember who condemns slavery, the West. Slavery is still practiced from the levant to Asia and most of Africa. When whites go so will this taboo. Plus, it isn&rsquo;t slavery if it is done to whites, its righting the wrongs of the past.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Righting the wrongs of the past would be enslaving, castrating and empaling all the muslim fiends for at least 1000 years, so we would be equals.</p>
<p><br>
Now I see why the Russians keep on killing those people of the Caucasus, self-defence.</p>
<p>The only language that a Muslim understand is sheer force.</p>
