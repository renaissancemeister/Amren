<h1>Two Men Arrested in Plot to Attack Seattle Military Processing Facility</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Carter, Seattle Times, June 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, also known as Joseph Anthony Davis, 33, of SeaTac, and Walli Mujahidh, aka Frederick Domingue Jr., 32, of Los Angeles, appeared in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Thursday on charges alleging they purchased machine guns and grenades from a paid police informant earlier this week as they moved into the final stages of planning an attack they hoped would inspire an uprising among radical Muslims in the United States.</p>
<p>Mujahidh arrived in Seattle from Los Angeles on Tuesday and he, Abdul-Latif and the informant went to lunch, according to details contained in a 38-page complaint. The men discussed details of the attack, including where they would hide the weapons.</p>
<p>The informant predicted, according to the complaint, that the case would make the news, and Mujahidh &#8220;described the imaginary headline of a newspaper article: &#8216;Three Muslim Males Walk Into MEPS building, Seattle, Washington, and Gun Down Everybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Details contained in the complaint and gleaned from other court documents and interviews show the men to be &#8220;self-radicalized,&#8221; with no known affiliation to al-Qaida or other terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>Both men are U.S. citizens and converts to Islam, according to the charges. {snip}</p>
<p>The men are charged with conspiracy to murder U.S. officers, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction (a grenade) and other firearms-related counts. {snip}</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan urged people to keep the arrests in perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the actions of individuals who adhere to a violent and extreme ideology and do not represent and should not reflect on the Muslim community as a whole,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We hope there is no backlash here. That would not be fair or what we stand for.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to charges, Abdul-Latif was recorded saying his anger over the United States military&rsquo;s real or perceived activities in Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen motivated the planned attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On June 14, Abdul-Latif met with the informant, who showed him several weapons provided by federal agents for a &#8220;show and tell.&#8221; The meeting was taped. Abdul-Latif chose an M16-style weapon because it had more firepower that would &#8220;leave a bigger hole,&#8221; according to the charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At least twice during the investigation, Abdul-Latif said the attack was inspired by the murderous shooting spree at Fort Hood in 2009, where a Muslim Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, killed 13 people and wounded 29 others.</p>
<p>The men planned to storm the building, kill the security guards, order everyone to the floor and kill as many military recruits as possible, according to the federal complaint. They talked about how they would target men wearing green and with short haircuts, according to the charges. The men scouted the center and discussed in detail the attack, including plans to kill the security guard in the lobby and order everyone else to the floor.</p>
<p>Grenades would be thrown in the cafeteria, and then they would walk through the hallways, firing their assault weapons, the complaint says.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the politically correct mush, I agree with Durkan, but for a different reason.  These arrests were the result of a &#8220;sting.&#8221;  The weapons the Federal stool pidgeon provided them were inoperable.  I&rsquo;m always suspicious of stings, like the &#8220;Liberty City Seven,&#8221; the dumb Haitian drug dealers in Miami who wanted to blow up the Sears Tower but didn&rsquo;t know what city the Sears Tower was in.  Methinks certain &#8220;anti-terrorism&#8221; sections of Federal law enforcement agencies don&rsquo;t want their budgets cut, so they&rsquo;re going out provoking more and more false flag incidents, all the while they&rsquo;ll miss the real terrorist types.</p>
<p>But if you want to believe this, this only proves that Peter King is right to want to hold hearings about Muslim radicals preaching to black prison inmates.</p>

		<p>Islam shouldn&rsquo;t take the blame for this one. </p>
<p>It appears these were just two American-born Africans with an axe to grind against white society.  Their conversion to Islam was just a symptom of their festering hate.</p>

		<p>And suppose there is a backlash?  Why should that be troubling?  Muslims have been creating &#8220;frontlash&#8221; in their incessant campaign to intimidate non-Muslims into accepting Islamicization of law, culture and politics in America.  If Americans grow suspicious of Muslims as a whole on the basis of those proverbial bad apples, I say, &#8220;Good.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s not some sort of odd phobia that creates this suspicion, it&rsquo;s the experience of very real lethal acts.  </p>
<p>Three cheers for backlash.  I call it defense.</p>

		<p>Just saw the wife of one of the men on local television here. She was talking animatedly, but wearing a black head covering with only her eyes visible.</p>
<p>I just wanted someone to tell her: &#8220;This is America. You don&rsquo;t have to dress like that unless you are planning a bank heist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just a couple of dimwits caught in a manufactured crime. The wife did say her husband had said nothing at home about this supposed plot.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t anyone read anymore? I have been learning about Islam since 9/11, and here are some facts from the three books of Islam.</p>
<p>1. Muslims are allowed to lie to non muslims, it&rsquo;s sanctioned in the Koran.<br>
2. Muslims are not allowed to befriend non muslims under penalty of death.<br>
3. Muslims are not allowed to leave Islam under penalty of death.<br>
4. A treaty is only to be followed when it benefits muslims, the instant it stops, it&rsquo;s toilet paper.  And on and on. Please LEARN about Islam, it&rsquo;s hideous.</p>

		<p>A grenade is a weapon of mass destruction, according to US justice ? Then how would they call a nuclear bomb ?</p>
<p>Also, are those numerous sting operations really useful against Muslim terrorism ? Would the arrested individuals have really comitted any crimes at all unless prompted and presented with weapons ? Isn&rsquo;t the police diverting precious resources away from monitoring really dangerous and organised Muslims who are actually determined to overthrow the United States&rsquo; government ?</p>

<p>This follows on the Obmanation&rsquo;s announced plans to withdraw a few troops from Afghanistan this past week   &mdash;   did he not promise to end &#8220;America&rsquo;s involvement in Afghanistan&#8221; as one of his campaign platforms?  And, will the ever stupid republicans dare to throw that in his face?  The war is becoming increasingly unpopular and more and ever more ridiculous ideas must be brought forth to justify sending our young white males into the meat grinder.</p>
<p>So, how does he play both sides?  Deliver a speech from the tele-prompter pre-written for him paying lip service to steady &#8220;troop drawdowns&#8221; and sketchy references to Afghanistan security forces taking over in 2014.   That should shut up the base that wants to end the overseas wars.</p>
<p>But wait!!  We can&rsquo;t withdraw our troops!!  We&rsquo;re fighting them over there so we won&rsquo;t have to fight them here in the US, (right?)   &mdash;   these &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, though homegrown,  are perfect examples that we have &#8220;a lot more work to do&#8221; in the &#8220;unstable&#8221; Middle East before we can withdraw troops.</p>
<p>IWO, the war is in danger of going out of business! <i>and that can&rsquo;t happen</i>.</p>
<p>Expect more false flags.  Lots of them.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t expect &#8220;terrorists&#8221; such as these to raise the ire of Homeland Security; they are still searching for the greatest danger to the US: white homegrown terrorists including white ex-military.  Now, <i>there&rsquo;s</i> the real danger.</p>

<p>That is up from 13.4 percent in 1974 and 29.4 percent in 1991.

<p>A study that looked at the relation between divorce rates and out-of-wedlock birthrates and violent crime between 1973 and 1995 found that nearly 90% of the change in violent crime rates can be accounted for by the change in percentages of out-of-wedlock births.

		<p>I look for these two to walk or get a mere slap.  </p>
<p>A google on U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan reveals that she identifies with &#8220;traditionally persecuted&#8221; groups. A couple of articles claim that she is openly gay as well, thus her outlook toward all such formally victimized (and now special) groups.  </p>
<p>She seems a bit flaky as well and appears to have poor judgement.  She relates an incident that happened to her in Pioneer Park in downtown Seattle where she was surrounded by a pack of &#8220;lowlifes&#8221; demanding money.  </p>
<p>Suddenly, she heard a man say &#8220;Leave her alone, she&rsquo;s my lawyer&#8221;.  Turned out the man was one she had gotten released form a public urination charge when she was a public defender. </p>
<p>Her reaction to the incident? She said &#8220;It pays to have people in lowly places.&#8221;  Why not say: &#8220;Guys, we must make our streets safe for citizens again.&#8221;  </p>
<p>A few years ago I was visiting Seattle on business and walked over to the Pioneer Park area.  While there, I noticed a large male (black-Hispanic-?) walking up and down the streets harassing tourists and shoppers. I got the feeling he was running a protection racket on the businesses as well. Not a cop in sight. Bums all over the place.   </p>
<p>Jenny Durkan is a libtard flake. By the way, in case she hasn&rsquo;t heard, there&rsquo;s already a backlash against Muslims. It&rsquo;s happening now in five Islamic countries courtesy the US military. </p>
