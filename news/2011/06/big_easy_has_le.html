<h1>Big Easy Has Lessons for SoBe</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[A] dramatic police shooting on the streets of South Beach this past weekend was video-taped and posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>The incident has prompted some people to call for an end to the annual Urban Beach Week, a celebration of hip-hop culture that draws an estimated 250,000 people, many of them African American, to South Beach during Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Complaints about Urban Beach Week have been common ever since hundreds of thousands of visitors swarmed South Beach for Urban Fashion Week about 10 years ago, catching many city officials by surprise. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Any talk of trying to bring an end to the weekend celebration needs to take place with a dose of proper perspective, keeping in mind that we&rsquo;re allowing the acts of a few hundred trouble-makers to define the hundreds of thousands of visitors who simply seek a fun weekend.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the event is a phenomenon, an organic burst of cultural identity that marketers and promoters can spend years studying and never replicate. Rather than quash it, city officials should embrace it and learn to better control and brand it.</p>

<p>Well, when this topic came up yesterday, I commented:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;To cancel this glorious celebration of African-amerikan Culture would be to &ldquo;disrespect&rdquo; this noble and cultured people.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Yeah, I would say that is really a dose of &#8220;proper perspective&#8221; you got there.  The acts of a &#8220;few hundred trouble makers&#8221; should not deter this &#8220;fun&#8221; weekend for the rest&hellip;</p>
<p>Au, contraire&hellip;..those silly little &#8220;acts&#8221; by BLACK CRIMINALS does seem to put a damper on things like having fun, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>One cannot go out and have any fun whatsoever when there are three or four or more blacks in the crowd, period! They all message their friends to join them for some &#8220;fun&#8221;. I will never go anywhere that has even a few blacks, let alone hundreds!</p>

		<p>We celebrate the contributions that Diversity makes to helping Whites finally admit, &#8220;Well, maybe we aren&rsquo;t the same after all. I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t ever act like that, and nobody I know would.  Why is that typical behavior for the Africans-who-stay-in-America?&#8221;</p>
<p>James Edwards has a sly rhetorical trick that we need to adopt.  Whenever you are with another White, realist or idealist, and a story of typical black behavior can&rsquo;t be avoided, just ask, &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t that what you would do?&#8221;</p>
<p>That one question has the power to undo years of &#8220;race is just a social construct because diversity is our strength and we need to do more to help minorities because all men are created equal and we need to do more to atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to the beloved community of color for our unearned White privileges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks jumped over the fence after the po-leece shut down the pool?  Isn&rsquo;t that what you would do?</p>
<p>Blacks started shooting each other when they were unsupervised by their Affirmative Action enforcers?  Isn&rsquo;t that what you would do?</p>
<p>Blacks rioted during the latest Juneteenth emancipation celebration? Isn&rsquo;t that what you would do?</p>
<p>That one question has the power to make a transformative change that will move us forward along the path toward a massive acceptance of Burkean reality.<br>

		<p>New Orleans had 334 people arrested last year and seven people shot, including an infant.</p>
<p>As soon as I read that sentence it became obvious that the entire article was oriented towards justifying one uncivilized event by blackening the reputation of another, equally bad, one.</p>
<p>Sorry, but only children use the twin excuses of &#8220;But if they can do it why can&rsquo;t we?&#8221; and &#8220;But he did it first and worse!&#8221;</p>
<p>I still say that someone in the mayoral staff is getting a BIG payday out of this and that&rsquo;s why it is being so glibly excused as being uncontrollable as a private activity.</p>
<p>You _know_ that the people who host these so-called private parties are making heaps of money off the booze or the drugs or the &#8216;displays&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And so the reality is that they could easily be regulated for having a certain number of people in a rented room for purposes of public performance where alcohol is being sold.</p>
<p>The question is whether you want the shakedown from that going in someone&rsquo;s back pocket or into a citywide insurance fund which could be so large to cover indemnities that it effectively sends most of the lower class party groups packing.</p>

		<p>I never cared for the word &#8220;flabbergasted&#8221; because it sounds, well, just plain silly.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I&rsquo;m flabbergasted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s  hard to believe in an age of enlightenment that Americans continue to allow their malleable minds to be manipulated by the merchants of multiculturalism. </p>
<p>Hordes of black thugs numbering in the hundreds of thousands add  nothing to a community. They don&rsquo;t come to spend money. They come to steal. An exception, maybe, is the drug business. It&rsquo;s akin to calling the hordes of Genghis Khan a welcome wagon. </p>
<p>Note, if you will, that the violence erupted simultaneously in various cities across the nation. Was this a conspiracy? Not even Alex Jones would bite on that. Truth is there is a genetic marker inherent within the sub-Saharan ethnic group. These people are genetically programmed to mesh in massive hordes. Crime and violence is innate. </p>
<p>Denial will solve nothing; nothing at all.</p>

		<p>Sorry if you live there,but it&rsquo;s better for the rest of us if they cause problems there instead of here.  They would be causing mischief wherever they are because that&rsquo;s what they do.  Doesn&rsquo;t Africa have a lot of beaches?  Maybe we could promote an african spring break in say africa?<br>

		<p>&#8220;Urban&#8221;, eh?</p>
<p>This perverse use of the term &#8220;urban&#8221; really gets on my nerves.</p>
<p>What they refer to, is Black ghetto culture. And it should be called for what it is! No point in trying to sell it as just &#8220;urban&#8221;; people aren&rsquo;t that stupid.</p>

<p>Wow! The marketers have really outdone themselves. I do not for the life of me understand this ninny around with regard to race and this reflexive idiocy on the part of Whites to excuse all things that fall under the rubric of bad Black behavior.</p>
<p>Do some Whites have a Darwinian self-destruct gene that causes them to want to excuse and cozy up to those Blacks that hate us and want to maim and/or kill us?</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t let the criminal actions of &#8220;a few hundred trouble-makers&#8221; lead you to any racist conclusions. And when even the apologists admit that it&rsquo;s &#8220;only a few thousand&#8221; or &#8220;a few tens of thousands,&#8221; then you won&rsquo;t be permitted to draw any conclusions either.</p>
<p>Never observe, learn, or generalize. Let people like &#8220;Jackie Bueno Sousa&#8221; do your thinking for you.</p>
