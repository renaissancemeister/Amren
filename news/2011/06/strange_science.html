<h1><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/29/strange-science-menstruat_n_886815.html">Strange Science: Menstruation Causes Prejudice?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Catherine Pearson, Huffington Post, June 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study suggests that depending on where they are in their menstrual cycles, women have very different reactions towards strange men. At their most fertile, women are more suspicious of men they see as outside of their social or racial group and who they perceive as being physically threatening. Which means that prejudice could, at least partially, be a byproduct of our biology.</p>
<p>Researchers from Michigan State University asked 252 college-age women  &mdash;  224 of whom were white and 28 of whom were black  &mdash;  to complete an online test in which they quickly associated traits like muscularity with photos of men of both races. They also asked a smaller pool of women to complete a similar test, this time asking them to wear a t-shirt that was either red, blue or yellow and then evaluate men who were also assigned one of those three color groups.</p>
<p>The researchers found that when they were at their most fertile, women were increasingly biased against men in a group different from their own  &mdash;  whether it was according to race, as in the first experiment, or according to t-shirt color, as in the second. Notably, this was only true of women who indicated that they saw the men as physically threatening.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What the small study suggests is that in addition to learned biases, there could be something about women&rsquo;s biology that leads them to protect themselves against men who they believe pose a risk to them, sexually, at the time when they are most &#8220;at risk&#8221; of getting pregnant. In other words, when women are more likely to conceive a child, they are biologically driven to be more discriminating about who they are going to mate with. Without necessarily realizing it, they protect themselves against men who they believe endanger that choice.</p>

		<p>Oh, the shame. &#8216;Scientists&rsquo; have yet another experiment designed to ferret out and expose hidden bias and racism. Important work, no doubt as these tests become more and more subtle and discerning. </p>

<p>This whole article is utterly bizarre. First of all just how many of the women saw men as &#8220;physically threatening&#8221;? Two out of 200?</p>
<p>Secondly that weird t-shirt bias add on of a &#8220;small group&#8221;. Maybe the multi-cults should force races to wear certain color t-shirts (ie. white women wear the same color as black men) as a way of profiting from this biological preference?<br>

A similar study showed that when women were menstruating that they found effeminate men attractive. When they were ovulating, they were attracted to masculine men.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;What the small study suggests is that in addition to learned biases&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Do you know what is strange and biased? The headline.</p>
<p>There is nothing strange about being attracted to a member of your own race. Bias doesn&rsquo;t need to be learned because it&rsquo;s natural and innate; something researchers have a difficult time accepting while spending too much time denying.<br>

This is going to become a &#8220;hate fact&#8221;. Rapes are going to increase, women still under the MSM hypnosis will look for men different from themselves when they are less fertile. What you study, you also change.<br>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;There are deep histories of negative stereotyping of black men of being, perhaps, sexually coercive,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;These stereotypes have been around for centuries, so it wasn&rsquo;t too far of a stretch to think we&rsquo;d see them here.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
<p>I guess that stereotype is connected to the fact that DOJ statistics* show that the percent of the black male population in this country that rape or sexually assault white women is roughly four times the percent of the white male population that rape or sexually assault white women.</p>
<p>(Scroll down to Table 42):</p>
<p><a href="/content/pub/pdf/cvus05.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus05.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#8220;But he said the fact that women also showed bias in the colored t-shirt experiment was extremely surprising. It indicates that there doesn&rsquo;t need to be a particularly deep cultural history for the prejudice to exist and to fluctuate according to fertility.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was surprised because he&rsquo;s a moron, made stupid by racial liberalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so pleasant to watch science, and studies like this one in other fields, increasingly putting the lie to the entire edifice of racial liberalism.</p>
<p>*If you go back to the DOJ statistics for 2005, before the figures were extremely jiggered by, I believe, including Hispanics as white. To see the unbelievable change in the figures just 2 years later, scroll down to Table 42 here:</p>

		<p>This makes no sense at least in my 62% black area. I go in wal-mart once or twice a week and can say that probably 50-60 percent of the younger girls, meaning 18to25ish either are with a black boy or have a black baby. I see it everywhere, I beleive that the lower class white girls, and quite a few middle-upper class white girls actually will pick a black over a white boy more of the time. Young white girls seem to have lost thier way having been brainwashed by the media and schools. Just out census study reports that over 50% of all under 2 kids are minorities. This report has to be true from what I see. Another problem nobody is talking about is if say 25% of the white girls go dark then where will the young white boys get girls.  I know so many many young single guys, but basically no single girls and by single I dont mean only mariied, but girls without boyfriends ect. Luckily, our young white guys for the most part do not find black girls attractive but still they need a white girl to have babies with,, and for a lot of them, a far higher percentage of them will be old bachelors than in past years, another nail in the coffin of the white race.

<p>Sexual vitality counts for a lot with young women, and a small dose of apprehension no doubt adds to the lure (as well as triggering guilt feelings about being &#8220;racist,&#8221; which can be expiated by sexual surrender).</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s face it (as the old South did), blacks have a notable sexual vitality.</p>
<p>Probably more importantly today is that, unlike many shy white youngsters, black males are relentless (&#8220;ardent,&#8221; I believe was Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s word for their pursuit of their women) in their pursuit of young white girls, calling the girls racist if they don&rsquo;t respond as they wish them to respond, and never letting up in their pursuit.</p>
<p>The sexual vitality of blacks and the sexual danger from blacks was well understood in the old South, which had the most reasonable system short of return to Africa to contain it, segregation.</p>

		<p>Poster # 16. You are so right. I went back to the States last year to visit my folks. I have lived in Australia (my wife is a Australian of Serbian/Greek heritage) for the past six years and was astounded by what I saw. There were absolutely huge numbers of white girls either holding hands with black boys, or were pushing strollers with black babies in them. It is almost to the point of where the white men have accepted it as a way of life. The new norm.  Also, Black men have essentially declared equal footing in courting white females. Many will look at the census and say &#8220;no way, according to the census, only 2% (or whatever the exact number is) of white woman marry black men&#8221;. They may be correct. The number of white women that marry black men may only be 2%. However as a general rule, black men do not marry. Therfore I would venture to say that for every white woman that is counted as being official &#8220;married&#8221; to a black man, you can safely assume that 4 or 5 more are either cohabitating with a black man, or have given birth to a black child.  </p>
<p>I do not think I would put the percentage as high as 50-60% as poster # 16 has. However I would say at least 25% of all white females in many major metropolitan areas across the country are crossing the racial divide. Particularly from the ages that poster #16 mentioned (18-25ish). Therfore I see many white men growing old alone. Some might say that quite a few white men marry Asian woman thereby balancing the trends out. I do not believe this is the case. Reason being, most white men I know that marry Asian ladies are from middle, to upper middle class backgrounds (not counting military members) who have some degree of education. Whereas many of the young white males losing large numbers of prospective mates to Africans are from lower middle class origins.  It will be from this group of white men that a very large number of Bachelors will emerge.  A particular demographic cannot lose 25% of their opposite sex to other men and have it go unnoticed in future trends. </p>
<p>What does this mean for the future? Well, the white men from that demographic most effected will be faced with some unfortunate decisions. They will either remain single and grow old alone without a family. They can turn to overseas woman (from Asia, eastern Europe or South America) to alleviate their loneliness and start a family. Or they can overlook the black children of a prospective female mate and become a stepfather seeing as though the bulk of black men will not raise the kid they create for more than a year or two after birth. </p>
<p>Personally, I think that any white man that would marry a white woman with black children would have to be psychology, emotionally, and spiritually defeated to do so. He would have to be able to admit to himself that he was his wife&rsquo;s number two choice (the 1st choice being a black man) That being said, the last of the three options I mentioned would not be a possibility for me.</p>

<p>Humpty:  Great comment, especially the lines about Thomas Jefferson!!</p>
<p>With White girls, it&rsquo;s everything you mentioned combined with brain washing coming from the media, educational and governmental triangulation against Whites, especially White males.</p>
<p>White males&rsquo; are portrayed in the media as wimpy, weak and effeminate in appearance;  oafish and brutish in personality; stupid and in need of rescue.</p>
<p>In the educational system, White males are depicted in textbooks as THE cause of all suffering in the world, past, present and future   &mdash;   as genocidal colonists, carriers of deadly disease and supreme racists, who must atone for ANY sins committed against non-Whites.</p>
<p>All this while blacks are presented as virile, hard working, intelligent, gentle, masculine, and peace loving.</p>
<p>I would add this:  <i>Teach your White children well</i>  Warn them about black violence!   Talk to them about why Whites should avoid blacks whenever possible.  You may just save their lives.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why (white) feminists and educators have spent the last 40 years telling us men don&rsquo;t need sex or girlfriends. (white) men who pursue women are verily made a criminal class. Men also seem to have very little connection to children. Even with their own children, sometimes. He&rsquo;s inconvenient and in the way and will surely be separated from &#8216;his&rsquo; (which they might not be biologically his) children if he separates from the mother. It&rsquo;s no surprise no one is talking about it. For many the idea doesn&rsquo;t enter their heads, until they are personally involved. </p>

		<p>If I had it to do over again, I might consider staying married and having 3-4 kids and raising them to maturity.  At least they&rsquo;d be white, and what they did with their lives after age 18 would be up to them.  Instead, I divorced early without having kids, and never married again nor had kids.  I love my life today, single and kid-free, BUT - I also see that I did not serve my race or my country by remaining childless.  Only one life, so many options!!!</p>

<p>Yes, I totally overlooked the extent to which young white women along with all the rest of us are told constantly by our media and other institutions that white men are not much &#8216;count, and black men are fine fellows. That&rsquo;s got to have some effect on their thinking, and also on the thinking of young white men and young black men, making the former more diffident and the latter even more puffed up with undeserved self-esteem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teach your White children well. Warn them about black violence!&#8221;</p>
<p>Amren has run these two articles about two mis-taught white women who were raped by blacks: </p>
<p>&#8220;Connors speculates that she might have run away in the awkward moments before David Francis attacked her had it not been for the fear that she&rsquo;d appear racist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman told detectives she was worried because the man looked like a thug, but she didn&rsquo;t want to seem racist.&#8221;</p>

<p>The standard answer is organ size.  But, what I can attest to personally from living single in the Big City is that blacks simply put more effort into getting a girl.   In a cafe or bar, black men would come up &amp; talk to me, while the white guys would slouch in the corner looking sullen.  I always wanted to tell the white guys, Well, who do you think the girl is going to go home with&hellip;?  I never did myslef (dates blacks) but I sort of understand why girls do.  No one likes to be ignored.<br>
