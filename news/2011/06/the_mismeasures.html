<h1><a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/06/gould-morton-revisited/">The Mismeasures of Stephen Jay Gould </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brandon Keim, Wired Science, June 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the rush to prove bias in a scientist who erroneously used skull-size measurements to demonstrate racial differences, the great historian Stephen Jay Gould may have succumbed to bias himself.</p>
<p>The argument centers on the work of Samuel Morton, who rose to 19th century acclaim by rigorously measuring the volume of human skulls. In those pre-Darwin days, he was looking for evidence that God created the races separately, though his findings that Caucasians had the highest average volume were also interpreted as evidence of their cognitive superiority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, it would seem that Gould was guilty of at least one accusation he made against Morton&rsquo;s methods. He omitted measurement of Native American skulls that would have altered his racial averages in unpalatable ways. As for the charge that Morton, who measured volume by packing skulls with mustard seed or buckshot, packed Caucasian skulls extra-tight, there was no evidence. And once mathematical errors were corrected in Gould&rsquo;s own cherry-picked dataset, they actually resembled Morton&rsquo;s supposed racial hierarchy more closely than Morton&rsquo;s own results.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To be certain, Lewis and DeGusta don&rsquo;t write that the scientific method can shield interpretations and assumptions from cultural biases. Those are a different matter altogether, and Morton&rsquo;s work was full of them: that humanity was created in one divine swoop a few thousand years ago, that 19th century racial categories were real and fixed, that between-group cranial differences were more significant than within-group. (That Morton believed cranial volume differences represented cognitive variation is now doubted, but many other researchers did. Such features are now recognized as <a href="/instruct/anth/smith/TimeMach1984.pdf">physiological adaptations to climate</a>, with no cognitive implications.) But as far as the data went, Morton was honest.</p>

		<p>Stephen Jay Gould did not &#8220;succumb to bias.&#8221;</p>
<p>He consciously and deliberately lied systematically about racial difference in order to further his ideological agenda and further his academic and literary career.</p>
<p>Like all other scientists without exception, he knew full well that natural selection either affect all organisms which ever existed on earth or else none of them.</p>
<p>And it shapes all of the organs of all of these organisms, or else none of them.</p>
<p>Natural selection shapes the human brain just as much as it does the other organs. </p>
<p>It determines psychology, levels of aggression and entity,  cognitive ability, etc. just as surely as it determines skin, hair, and eye color.</p>
<p>If two species of rabbit have differently shaped skulls, then all scientists on earth without exception - including that lying liar Stephen Jay Gould - would assume as a matter of course that they have differently shaped brains, and hence brains which function differently.</p>
<p>Brain size apart, the skulls of Africans are shaped differently than the skulls of Caucasians. </p>
<p>Therefore, it is impossible even theoretically for the brains which fit inside of them to be the same.</p>
<p>All of this is as axiomatic and obvious as 2+2 equals four. <br>
 <br>
We have been lied to for century by scientists who have known better.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Such features are now recognized as physiological adaptations to climate, with no cognitive implications.&rdquo;  Even if the first half of that were true, that of climate adaptation, it is far from certain the latter is true, that of no cognitive implications.  An evolutionary argument could be made that those in warm climes with much food available year round require less of it inhabitants in order to survive to procreate than a colder clime where death by starvation is an annual reality.</p>

This is basically a lie with a grain of truth buried in it, so that non-Whites feel can better that science &#8220;refutes&#8221; White supremacy (whatever in the world that is).</p>
<p>The White brain evolved as a response to selective pressures forced on it by the colder climate. Crops do not grow constantly, and if you don&rsquo;t plan ahead, the winter will simply kill you even if you have enough food. Peoples near the equator don&rsquo;t face this problem and so never evolved brains that are identical to Whites&rsquo;.</p>
<p>See? It&rsquo;s an &#8220;adaptation to climate&#8221;. There are no cognitive implications. Well, OK, there are, but we won&rsquo;t talk about them because we can&rsquo;t be adults about the data.</p>

However, if there are &#8220;no cognitive implications,&#8221; why is there a correlation between brain size and intelligence? <br>

		<p>Brain weight/volume are the simplest of the differences between black and white brains. There are more significant physiological differences between the brains of the two races, such as the amount of fissures present in the two brains, with whites having much more. this gives the white brain larger surface area.</p>

		<p>There is a difference in the black brain that may or not be physically measured, but contributes to the biggest difference between blacks and whites. It is the personality, that the black race has a much higher percentage of sociopathic personality disorder than the other races.  </p>

		<p>2 Elitist:</p>
<p>Sam Francis would have liked you. </p>
<p>One of things he always taught me, and tried to teach everybody, is that you can&rsquo;t look at modern political ideology in a vacuum, you best understand it when you realize who does and who does not benefit from its attaching itself to the public policy making process.  Some air-headed lamestream conservatives like to talk about the &#8220;power of ideas,&#8221; (as if an idea had power by itself) but Sam thought more of the converse   &mdash;   the ideas of power.  In other words, it&rsquo;s not the ideas that had power, it&rsquo;s the people that have power, and they&rsquo;ll only adopt and promulgate the sort of ideas that accrue to their power.</p>
<p>Stephen Jay Gould being a blatant liar and engaging in blatant deceit is true, but ultimately moot.  It didn&rsquo;t even matter to him that someone could easily refute his ideas.  All that matters is that racial egalitarianism as a matter of public policy and &#8220;polite&#8221; social assumption directly benefits some very powerful and wealthy people, who will use some of their power and wealth to benefit pseudo-academics like Gould.  It&rsquo;s not that &#8220;might&#8221; makes right, it&rsquo;s that money and power get to define &#8220;right.&#8221;  Videri quam esse. </p>

		<p>Evolution, natural selection, the origin of species and the descent of man and the like are amazing in that they persist, even among people who should know better, simply because they are labeled, scientific.</p>
<p>Rarely, these days, does anyone bother to examine what that means.  Or bothers to notice that, without exception, every bit of &#8220;scientific evidence&#8221; put forth has turned out to be a hoax.  Heck, I remember being taught about such things as &#8220;the peppered moths&#8221; in high school, secure in the knowledge that evidence for evolution was plentiful, widespread, systematic and non-controversial.  Years later, in graduate school, I learned the &#8220;peppered&#8221; moths were actually a hoax and had been painted.  And that everything I ever learned about evolution, right down to things like Piltdown man, had been frauds.  Known frauds&hellip;.I had literally been lied to in school.</p>
<p>Here is the thing.  There is no scientific evidence for evolution.  Even bacteria forced to undergo thousands of generations of replication don&rsquo;t exhibit what you would expect if evolution was fact instead of fiction.  There is no continuous change of one species to another in the fossil record (the absence of this, by itself is STRONG refutation of evolution as a theory).  You do not see evolution on a macro level.  You do not see it in microbiology.  In fact, parts of the theory&hellip;for example, that life originated in a primordial ooze, are patently absurd and violate prime tenants of biology (that life only originates from life&hellip;.and never from non-life).</p>
<p>The best I can figure out is that evolution has never been more than a vague set of suppositions that start with the assumption that God does not exist, life advances, and since science is somehow the be all and end all of human thought (instead of being a series of tools for gaining useful knowledge), that anything that sounds &#8220;scientific&#8221; must be true and unquestionable.  It&rsquo;s basically, atheist gobblydegook that has never provided accurate knowledge of anything and has been used almost exclusively to try and weaken Christianity.</p>
<p>The Descent of Man is particularly noxious, insisting that obviously superior whites must assume kinship with blacks.  It&rsquo;s all just a giant communist scam. We aren&rsquo;t even the same species, although, much like wolves and dogs, we can interbreed (but don&rsquo;t in natural circumstances).  We are, in fact, natural enemies.  It&rsquo;s obvious in any serious inquiry into our history without the burden of the Descent of Man hoax.<br>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim to know this (nor does anyone); but I have to speculate as to whether this often-displayed sociopathic behavior is a result of the disharmony of living within a white-created civilization that operates on white standards, a situation to  which blacks are not naturally adapted by their  own evolution.</p>
<p>In other words, what&rsquo;s sauce for the goose is NOT  (necessarily) sauce for the gander.  To each his own.</p>
<p>To state it further: settled, orderly civilization   &mdash;   a fundamentally unnatural condition, something relatively new to humanity, a mode of living to which Europeans and Asiatics have had ten thousand years to adapt   &mdash;   is  novel and difficult for African blacks to adjust to.</p>

		<p>Gould is only one of a long list of so-called academics who have lied to further their careers and to further a political agenda.</p>
<p>One Margaret Mead comes to mind. As I recall, she was a graduate student at one of the ivy league universities studying Franz Boaz when she a wrote a book called COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA; this book has been required reading in practically every introductory Anthropology course in college for generations now.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Miss Mead conjured virtually all of the data she used to come to her conclusions about the the free-wheeling, free love going on in Samoan society among the young people. To my knowledge, the academy has never formally censured Mead, nor has it refuted her data.</p>
<p>As many Amreners know, this kind of &#8220;academic deception&#8221; has long been used by the elites to further their agenda to bring about a &#8220;fundamental transformation&#8221; in our society. </p>
<p>If I recall correctly, Franz Boaz was a member of the The Frankfurt School, which dominated the &#8220;soft sciences&#8221; in America from the early 20th century. The elites have very successfully used this domination to undermine American education and thus American society to advance their agenda.</p>
<p>For more insight into how this has transpired, search the internet using The Frankfurt School as a search criterion. </p>
<p>Boaz, Mead, and Gould have all been integral to the successful deconstruction of our culture. Given that they ensconsed themselves in our &#8220;elite&#8221; universities, their influence has been greatly amplified. Once the lies and deceptions are uncovered, the damage has been done. </p>
<p>And the beat goes on.</p>

<p>You are either stunningly ignorant, mentally challenged, or a troll.  You might as well go around shouting that the Earth is flat or that the sun revolves around the Earth.  There is now massive, irrefutable evidence proving evolution, and it is corroborated from thousands of different examples and perspective, spanning virtually all biological fields.   You need to read any evolution textbook, such as Futuyma or Strickberger, or Freeman.</p>
<p> Note also that evolutionary biology provides the scientific basis for racial differences.  Evolutionary biology is a friend to us at American Renaissance.  I think that you are a troll, simply tossing vinegar into the cake mix<br>

		<p><i>If I recall correctly, Franz Boaz was a member of the The Frankfurt School, which dominated the &ldquo;soft sciences&rdquo; in America from the early 20th century.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Boaz (or Boas) was an official member of The Frankfurt School; nevertheless, his influence contributed greatly to the advance of Political Correctness and attendant breakdown of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>Boaz pushed an ideological and political shift in the social sciences and opposed research on human genetics   &mdash;   and not from the emergence of new empirical data.  His ideology was meant to counter the racialist theories of American eugenicists like Madison Grant, whose book, The Passing of the Great Race was highly critical of Boas&rsquo;s research</p>
<p><i>Boas, almost single-handedly, developed in America the concept of &#8216;culture&rsquo; which he believed would in time expunge race from the literature of social science.</i></p>
<p>And, importantly:</p>
<p><i>The four decades of the tenure of [Boas&rsquo;s] professorship at Columbia gave a continuity to his teaching&hellip;his students eventually made up the greater part of the significant professional core of American anthropologists, and who came to man and direct most of the major departments of anthropology in the United States.</i></p>
<p>Again, his influence cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>For decades, Boas set back research on the study of human genetics and to this day psychometricians  brave enough to study and publish data about racial differences are demonized, labeled Nazi, attacked physically, their life&rsquo;s work suppressed and ignored.</p>

		<p>The squalid story of Stephen Jay Gould demonstrates that those who want us to believe that &#8220;race is only a social construct,&#8221; and that the only differences between the races are cosmetic need to rely on lies and politically correct thought control. <br>
 <br>
If the scientific evidence really demonstrated that the races are equivalent in average ability, personality, and character it would not be necessary to persecute those who maintain otherwise. <br>
 <br>
The intolerance of liberals on this issue is particularly detestable because they claim to believe in free expression. They are staunch defenders of pornography, blasphemy, and flag desecration. They have no qualms about suppressing scientific facts that impede their agenda. <br>
 <br>
In &#8220;The Inequality Taboo,&#8221; Charles Murray wrote, &#8220;specific policies based on premises that conflict with scientific truths about human beings tend not to work.

		<p>The exposure of Stephen Jay Gould as a charlatan comes at an explosive time in American history. The civil rights legislation was passed when the median income adjusted for inflation had been growing for several decades, and continual growth seemed inevitable. <br>
 <br>
Right now the U.S. economy appears to be in a period of prolonged and irreversible decline. There will be less generosity toward those who are seen to have genetic predispositions toward low intelligence and crime. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Here is the thing. There is no scientific evidence for evolution. Even bacteria forced to undergo thousands of generations of replication don&rsquo;t exhibit what you would expect if evolution was fact instead of fiction. There is no continuous change of one species to another in the fossil record (the absence of this, by itself is STRONG refutation of evolution as a theory). You do not see evolution on a macro level. You do not see it in microbiology. In fact, parts of the theory&hellip;for example, that life originated in a primordial ooze, are patently absurd and violate prime tenants of biology (that life only originates from life&hellip;.and never from non-life).&#8221;</p>
<p>Um&hellip;I just took Medical Microbiology. Multi-drug Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus is recent mutation due to the large amount of antibiotics treating it. Certain drugs like Penicillin, a narrow spectrum, do not work on the new Aureus strand. This can be shown on cultures where the bacteria continues to grow over the where P is placed (unlike photographs that show differently in the past).</p>
<p>What happened? Magic?</p>
