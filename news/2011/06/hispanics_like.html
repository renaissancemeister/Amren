			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lamar Smith, Politico, June 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in the 1986 election, after a Republican president signed into law the largest amnesty for illegal immigrants in American history, only 23 percent of Hispanics voted for Republican candidates.</p>
<p>More recently, a November 2009 Zogby poll found that 82 percent of likely Hispanic voters strongly or somewhat support reducing the illegal immigrant population over time by enforcing existing immigration laws, such as requiring employers to verify the legal status of workers and increasing border enforcement.</p>
<p>Exit polls reported by CNN reveal that 38 percent of Hispanic voters cast ballots for House Republican candidates in 2010, significantly more than in 2006 (30 percent) and 2008 (29 percent). And this level of Hispanic support for Republican candidates came despite widespread pre-election claims by advocates for illegal immigration that a pro-rule-of-law stand would alienate Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>{snip} Voters elected Susana Martinez governor of New Mexico, Brian Sandoval governor of Nevada and Marco Rubio to the U.S. Senate from Florida. All are Republicans.</p>
<p>And these Hispanic candidates come from states with large and growing Hispanic populations. According to 2010 census data, states with the largest Hispanic share of total population include New Mexico (46 percent), Texas (38 percent), California (38 percent), Arizona (30 percent), Nevada (27 percent) and Florida (23 percent).</p>
<p>Voters also elected five pro-enforcement Hispanic Republicans to the House of Representatives: {snip}</p>
<p>How did Republican candidates appeal to Hispanic voters? They focused on the fundamental values of patriotism, rule of law, freedom, family, support for small businesses, jobs and education.</p>
<p>The pro-enforcement movement is not anti-Hispanic; it is pro-rule-of-law. Time and again, American voters  &mdash;  including Hispanics  &mdash;  have defeated amnesty attempts, including the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform legislation.</p>
<p>Contrary to the claims made by some, the record shows that Republicans will continue to attract Hispanic voters, and more Republican Hispanic candidates will be elected to public office. {snip}</p>

		<p>I actually know latinos who came here the legal way who don&rsquo;t like the illegals.  The illegals take jobs away from them and ruin their neighborhoods also.  Cesar Chavez thought this way, unbeknownst to most left wing, brown-shirt latino activists.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to guess that a lot of Hispanics live in America because they prefer it to Mexico. As such, they might not be too keen on seeing America turning into the Mexico they have left.</p>
<p>Of course, their &#8216;leaders&rsquo; will see otherwise and they are the ones making all the noise and grabbing the attention of the Lamestream media and the lilly livered RINO&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Yep, these family value oriented Hispanic-Americans. I sure don&rsquo;t see them or HEAR from them, do you?  </p>
<p>Why is it people like you, Republicans, only CARE about hispanics, blacks, etc and never talk about your White voter base, you know who have, &#8220;fundamental values of patriotism, rule of law, freedom, family, support for small businesses, jobs and education.&#8221;  HUH?  When you turncoats start pandering to WHITES, then I may just vote for you. But not until then. </p>

		<p>Legal Hispanic citizens have the attitude that &#8220;I (or my parents) immigrated to the US the LEGAL way and jumped through all the hoops, so why can&rsquo;t they do the same?&#8221; meaning the illegals. Also there is the inconvenient fact that they have to compete with the illegals for the same jobs and services, many of which are tacitly available only to illegals. THEY know full well why these illegal aliens are here and what they are up to, and they don&rsquo;t have to feel guilty about expressing their outrage at their actions, beliefs and backward cultures.  White people on the other hand are muzzled on the subject through fear of being branded racist, and losing their jobs and reputations or worse.</p>

		<p>If there are Hispanics who think that the invasion should end, then why not form groups and speak out loudly against those who break our laws? If they, and we, were as vocal and demanding as the invaders, we&rsquo;d do a lot toward stopping the continued occupation of our nation. Of course, we need a government who stands with us rather than the criminals, and will use every means possible to stop the destruction of our country.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care one iota about what the &#8220;legal&#8221; hispanics think or feel. They have no &#8220;outrage&#8221; over their brethren crossing our borders. </p>
<p>THEY are NOT on the White side to begin with. RACE trumps all and never forget it! Too bad that some posters here on Amren still have not figured that one out yet. Too bad that most Whites do not have that natural instinct of RACE TRUMPS ALL.</p>

		<p>Well I disagree with those saying where is the outrage?  There is an organization called &#8220;you don&rsquo;t speak for me&#8221; look it up. It is made up of &#8220;Latinos&#8221; who are against illegal immigration. This organization has only been shown in Lou Dobbs tonite when he was on CNN.

		<p>The error in Lamar Smith&rsquo;s analysis is that he uses the percentage of Hispanics that voted Republican in the first mid-term elections after &#8216;86 IRCA was passed (Nov. 1986) as a reliable baseline.  The problem is, &#8216;86 Midterms were good for Democrats   &mdash;   They made gains in the House, and took back the Senate after six years of Republican control, thanks to Reagan fatigue.  The Hispanic Republican vote was going to be small no matter what happened earlier in the year with immigration legislation.  By the way, where was all the Hispanic gratitude toward Republicans that election season, huh Lamar?</p>
<p>Bob Dole got in the mid-20s of percent of the Hispanic vote in 1996 vs Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>The main reason why Hispanic vote for Republicans was higher in 2010 than in 2008 or 2006 is because the Hispanic vote mirrors the white vote in the direction of trend.  If the percentage of whites that vote Republican goes up, so will the percentage of Hispanics that vote Republican.  And vice versa.  Always, though, the white for Republican percentage will be way higher.</p>

Sounds like you are trying to convince us that &#8220;many&#8221; legal hispanics are against these hispanic invaders?  I don&rsquo;t buy into that simply due to my own experiences living and working around these &#8220;hispanics&#8221;&hellip;Just how many Latinos are in that organization compared to their numbers in our country? Very few. </p>
<p><br>
I worked in a place that employed about 60% &#8220;hispanics&#8221; (government job) and whenever any White person mentioned all these illegals getting benefits (that the public knows nothing about) those same LEGAL hispanics did not like us saying anything about their racial brothers and sisters. I once asked if they liked these illegals crossing our borders and receiving taxpayer funded benefits. The typical answer was, &#8220;they come here to work and to better themselves&#8221;. I replied, &#8220;well then how come they are receiving all these benefits if they &#8220;come to work&#8221; and then go on and commit so many crimes to our detriment&#8221;? Is that good for America? Their pat answer was, &#8220;we are a nation of immigrants&#8221; baloney. They are as irrational as blacks are, when pointing out facts or discussing any truths that pertain to their racial groups. </p>

Divide &amp; conquer. By excluding middle-class Latinos from the White Middle class&rsquo; struggle to save the country, you inevitably lead theM and their $$$ into the arms of Liberal extremists. Working with them doesn&rsquo;t have to equal supporting miscegenation.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I know some pretty decent Hispanics who are pre-1950 &#8216;first generation&rsquo; immigrants that came here with a high work ethic and have plowed their way through prejudice, hard times and lousy jobs to have finally made it in life, ever since.</p>
<p>For all this, they are still altruistically Christian, once they have come to accept you into their way of thinking as an ignorant outsider who is no threat.</p>
<p>I respect them immensely, not least because they have retained what I consider to be a proper (for whites) family architecture of three kids after marriage and a mom who stayed at home to raise them, even though the husband was working 2-3 low end service jobs for much of his youth and middle age.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t consider them to be the ideal for a post-white Republican America however for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1.  Their daughters have turned into typical second generation <br>
    hispanics with families born out of wedlock (one dad is in <br>
    jail), low social achievement in college, drug abuse and a <br>
    lot of &#8216;community organizing&rsquo; vs. high end career placement<br>
    achievement, after joining the workforce.<br>
2.  They are highly politically aware, vote entirely left of <br>
    center and never saw a social entitlement they didn&rsquo;t like <br>
    the look of, &#8216;for their children&rsquo; as much as themselves.  <br>
    They would institutionalize a social welfare nanny state if <br>
    they could.<br>
3.  They are highly religious.  Which includes an abhorrence of <br>
    prophylactics and abortion to control fertility.  This <br>
    extends as well to a patriarchal view of the place of women <br>
    in society which is very much subservient (though he equally <br>
    loves her very much).</p>
<p>For all that they are very personable, kind, people; they remain very much the stereotype of &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; in genetic culture attributes of high birth rate, low productivity and socialist politics.</p>
<p>Once Republicans have enough people like them in the fold they will become it&rsquo;s political complexion as much as skin tone changing the party from the inside out.  They will _never_ <br>
&#8216;assimilate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And then miscegenation will be by culture values as much as, if not more than, by intermarriage.  And so they will outnumber us in ten generations instead of five but they will still outnumber and replace us, as a distinct heritage of white excellence.</p>

<p>Actually, no.  Hispanics have very much a common identity that transcends nationalism and which they share through dialectic Spanish language.</p>
<p>They -enjoy- the sense of privilege of having an elevated class status relative to new comers who, less fortunate than themselves, often come to them like an Italian before his Godfather to beg advice or favors.</p>
<p>It is the ultimate expression of machismo to grant wisdom and opportunity through social networking with illegals who then depend on you and can be exploited to provide easy labor in trade for short term jobs, awareness of free ESL classes and othe social programs, employment references and residency affirmations.</p>
<p>Same family as above, the Hispanic patriarch does not realize that I speak some Spanish.  Hearing him describe me and my situation (the details of which I had given in confidence, in order to gain his patronage because no white would help me) to an illegal alien that came to his porch under similar circumstances was quite enlightening.</p>
<p>It was also the end of my trust in the genuineness of his friendship.</p>
<p>No matter how much you may want to believe otherwise, #6 has it right.  Race trumps all.  Culture derives from genes.  And if you once intermix and trade off dominance between cultures for cheap votes and social status among your own kind, you guarantee the ruination of both the culture and the genes whose legacy are your inheritance.</p>

<p>I would say more than you think especially ones of non-Mexican stock. Very few legal  mexicans will be vocal about their dislike of illegal immigration due to fear of being called sell-outs, self hating etc.  If you worked in a goverment office and witnessed this type of racial preference and system abuse, what did you do to stop it? Did you deny these invaders benefits? Did you become a whistleblower?</p>
