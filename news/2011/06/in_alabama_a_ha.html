<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/us/04immig.html?_r=1">In Alabama, a Harsh Bill for Residents Here Illegally</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Preston, New York Times, June 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Alabama has passed a sweeping bill to crack down on illegal immigrants that both supporters and opponents call the toughest of its kind in the country, going well beyond a law Arizona passed last year that caused a furor there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alabama&rsquo;s bill goes beyond Arizona&rsquo;s. It bars illegal immigrants from enrolling in any public college after high school. It obliges public schools to determine the immigration status of all students, requiring parents of foreign-born students to report the immigration status of their children.</p>
<p>The bill requires Alabama&rsquo;s public schools to publish figures on the number of immigrants  &mdash;  both legal and illegal  &mdash;  who are enrolled and on any costs associated with the education of illegal immigrant children.</p>
<p>The bill, known as H.B. 56, also makes it a crime to knowingly rent housing to an illegal immigrant. It bars businesses from taking tax deductions on wages paid to unauthorized immigrants.</p>

 NYT and MSM always offer good entertainment in their choice of words for sensible measures that may slow down the loss of White America for White Humanity.  Doing the right thing for Whitey is &#8220;harsh&#8221;.  We are disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t call the law &#8220;vile&#8221; and work in the pagan prayer &#8220;our cities must reflect the wonderful global diversity that so much contributes enriching multicultural authenticity to our shared life and better, inclusive, tolerant, and welcoming future for all&#8221; and &#8220;we must fight these hateful anti immigrant laws and bring the Alabama along with us as we march toward a fulfillment of the American Promise&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we hold fast to the White Faith of our White Fathers:</p>

		<p>Ga. has a new similar law.  According to the news, farm employers are having a hard time keeping workers, but applicants for unemployment won&rsquo;t consider farm work.</p>
<p>Our White guv&rsquo;nah is too much of an establishment Rino that he didn&rsquo;t dare say on TV that he&rsquo;ll introduce a bill that requires our unemployment beneficiaries to prove they&rsquo;ve been turned down for a farm job.  That requirement would be &#8220;insensitive,&#8221; no doubt.</p>
<p>We need more insensitivity if we are to survive. We won&rsquo;t, so don&rsquo;t expect much but horrors in the dystopian non white future.  Doesn&rsquo;t it just terrify you to imagine how we will be treated when we are a minority?  We will be proven the fools of the universe.  We sacrificed ourselves for our sworn enemies, then they turned on us with a vengeance.   We deserve whatever we get. Let&rsquo;s just make sure the liberal elites are on the front lines of the reception of the Diversity Curse.<br>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s to Alabama! Well done on getting this measure passed- let those who protest these new laws live with the consequences of illegal immigration as state after state forces people who are ipso facto criminals into the &#8220;sanctuaries&#8221; created by liberalism.</p>

		<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>HB.56 will of course be shot down, just like SB.1070 was, unless you Alabama can find the means to independently prosecute and house illegal immigrants for something like inability to pay state and local taxes and insurance premiums and thus not invite Federal oversight of their _immigration_ status perse.</p>
<p>The reporting of criminal alien children in our education system may be of some statistical use for historians, &#8216;far into the future&rsquo;, as proof of exactly how outrageously expensive (to taxpayers) the education of these children was, compared to the profiteering benefits of junk consumerism, declining wages and total productivity gains of ethnic wage slaves that accrued exclusively to the megacorps.</p>
<p>But that assumes we can ever catch up with and fine said companies which will have long since fled to extranationalist locales and group alliances.  Otherwise it&rsquo;s just more dead trees.</p>
<p>More important will be the E-Verify statistics which either will or will not prove how critical immigrants are to the &#8216;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s here where I hope there is a real chink in the fat cat&rsquo;s armor.  Because, if you believe VDare (and I do) _most of those jobs ARE done by legal residents_!!</p>
<p>Finally, until and unless we begin to challenge the United States as a federal body (with more than 16 states participating), it won&rsquo;t really matter what individual States do because we will never gain traction in the minds of Americans sufficient to overcome the brainwashing by which the MSM would have us all believe that these are the actions of a small group of latent racists in each State legislature.</p>
<p>Rather than the effective and applied power of the will of the people overall.</p>

		<p>I wonder if we could use this information to bill Mexico for schooling and for medical bills for Mexican nationals in our country so America does not have to pay the bill, and if the Mexican Government does not pay the bill, could we then confiscate property owned by the government of Mexico to pay the bill.</p>

		<p>South Carolina also bars illegal immigrants from attending all public colleges in that state. Georgia has barred illegals from attending the 5 most selective colleges in that state and legislation was introducted to bar illegals from all public colleges that failed and will be introducted next year in the legislature.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m surprised by all the negativity on here. The more states that pass tough legislation like this, the easier it will be for other states to join the bandwagon. </p>
<p>Yes, liberal judges will try to water this down, but that&rsquo;s missing the point: more and more stories like this will indicate that whites are finally starting to wake up. The more whites that wake up, the more of an unstoppable force they will become. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about any one bill, people! It&rsquo;s about the total momentum of one such bill after another after another after another after another.</p>

		<p>Oh Ye of so Little Faith!!</p>
<p>Just when you thought All Hope Be Lost&hellip;.</p>
<p>I agree the situation is not good with SCOTUS hanging on by a thread, but, this just in from Roy Beck&rsquo;s site:</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT SAYS COURT OF APPEALS <br>
WAS WRONG IN BLOCKING <br>
HAZELTON&rsquo;S E-VERIFY ORDINANCE </p>
<p>MAYOR LOU BARLETTA&rsquo;S ORDINANCE SPARKED A NATIONAL EFFORT OF LOCAL &amp; STATES TO PASS OWN E-VERIFY LAWS </p>
<p>This Ruling Opens Way For A Lot More Pressure Against Illegal Foreign Workers   &mdash;   2 Weeks After Supreme Court Approved Arizona&rsquo;s E-Verify Law </p>
<p><i>The Associated Press has just reported that &#8220;two weeks after issuing a major ruling affirming a state&rsquo;s right to pass legislation cracking down on employers who knowingly hire illegal workers, the Supreme Court has voided a lower court ruling blocking a city ordinance that does the same and also targets landlords who willfully house illegals.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>This is a start and a strong message not to give up the fight   &mdash;   if anything, illegals and their supporters will get the message that Alabama, Pennsylvania  and any other states passing these types of laws are hostile to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>If there isn&rsquo;t a better reason to vote against 0bama, I don&rsquo;t know of one.  One more lefty SCOTUS appointee and these 5-4 rulings will become 4-5 rulings against illegal immigration crack-downs (and pro more AA, Hate Speech Laws and anti-White discrimination).  Mobilize your family  NOW and everyone you know to get this loser OUT OF OFFICE!!</p>

		<p>10:  I have to apologize in advance, because I&rsquo;m going to come off like an arrogant jerk.  But I keep saying it here, have been saying it since last July, yet the message hasn&rsquo;t sunk through.</p>
<p>SB 1070 has not been &#8220;shot down.&#8221;  Parts of it have been temporarily enjoined pending the hearings on its constitutionality.  Any court decisions you have heard about SB 1070 are in the injunctive phase, not the constitutional phase.  So far, a Federal trial level court in Phoenix issued injunctions of parts of SB 1070 on July 29, and just several weeks ago, the 9th Appellate Circuit sustained the injunctions after Arizona appealed.  Gov. Brewer said she will appeal that ruling the SCOTUS, they have not yet decided on cert or not.</p>
<p>The constitutional procedure is still in Federal trial courts in Phoenix, incidentally the same judge that issued the injunctions last July will hear the arguments.  I don&rsquo;t know if that judge has heard arguments or if a date for her to do so is pending.</p>
<p>However, the parts of SB 1070 that were not enjoined are enforceable (and enforced) law in Arizona as I type these words.  </p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/z4va5" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/z4va5</a></p>
<p>That will tell you what of SB 1070 can and cannot be enforced at the moment.</p>
<p>You probably heard that SCOTUS found for Arizona on another immigration-related law a few weeks ago.  (One that Janet Napolitano signed while he was Governor, incidentally).  The conventional media wisdom is that it&rsquo;s a good leading indicator about how this same SCOTUS (assuming no membership changes) would rule on SB 1070.  However, I am not yet ready to jump to that conclusion, because the particular law in front of the court a few weeks ago punished American citizen business owners and employers for violating Federal immigration law that applied to American citizens, applying the Federal immigration law to the letter as state law.  SCOTUS said that that wasn&rsquo;t unconstitutional pre-emption, however, they might have a different attitude about a state law that punishes the illegal aliens themselves as a state crime for violating a state level law that copies Fed immig law.</p>

1. IRS/CRA is not a Government Agency; it is a collection agency. All Alphabet Agencies (CIA, DOT, etc.)<br>
are agencies of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) which is an agency of the UN.<br>
2. SSNs/SINs are issued by the UN via the IMF, not by Social Security Administration or CRA<br>
3. There are no Judicial courts and hence no &lsquo;judges&rsquo; overseeing &lsquo;law&rsquo;. There are Executive<br>
Administrators enforcing Statutes and Codes.<br>
4. You own no property; slaves can&rsquo;t own property. Read the Deed to the property that you think is<br>
yours. You are listed as a Tenant.<br>
5. The Revolutionary War was a fiction/fraud/ruse. The King of England financially backed both sides<br>
of the American Revolutionary war.<br>
6. America is a British Colony. Britain is owned by the Vatican.<br>
7. The Pope can abolish any law in USA/CA. Pope&rsquo;s laws are obligatory. The Pope has ordered the<br>
genocide and enslavement of millions of people.<br>
8. We are slaves and own absolutely nothing – not even what we think are our children.<br>
9. The duty of the police is not to protect you; it is to protect the Corporation and arrest code-breakers.<br>
10. Everything in CA/USA is For Sale: roads, bridges (yes, the Brooklyn Bridge is for sale), schools,<br>
hospitals, water, prisons, airports, etc.<br>
11. Social Security/Insurance is not insurance; nor is there a Trust Fund holding it. The SS/SI cheque<br>
comes directly from the IMF which is an Agency of the UN<br>
12. A 1040/ T1 (filing) form is for tribute paid to Britain – the interest on the bankruptcy.<br>
13. We are enemies of the State pursuant to Trading with the Enemy Act, 1933<br>
14. The Constitution cannot be used to &lsquo;defend&rsquo; oneself as none of us is a party to it.<br>
15. Can/Am is a British colony. CA/USA are private corporations, not territories.<br>
16. The UN has financed the operations of CA/USA gov&rsquo;t for over 50 years; it owns every man, woman,<br>
and child and also holds all the land in Can/Am in Fee Simple.<br>
17. We do not owe &lsquo;public/ national debt&rsquo; – we can discharge fictitious public obligations.<br>
18. All wars are a scam/farce/fiction. USA/CA and other corporations were making loans to others all<br>
over the world during the Depression. USA financed the building of Germany&rsquo;s infrastructure in the 1930s.<br>
All those who died defending their non-existent &lsquo;countries&rsquo; died in vain. Switzerland is &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; as this is<br>
where the Bank of International Settlements is located. Wars are simply a red herring to keep us believing<br>
that government is necessary.</p>

<p> The good news is that some states are waking up.
