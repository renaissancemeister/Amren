to offer counseling to one of the black students charged with the crime. In
2009, a black Columbia University professor assaulted a white woman during a
heated argument about race relations. According to interviews and court records
obtained and reported by Denver&rsquo;s ABC affiliate (12/4/2009), black gangs roamed
downtown Denver verbally venting their hatred for white victims before
assaulting and robbing them during a four-month crime wave. Earlier this year,
two black girls beat a white girl at a McDonald&rsquo;s, and the victim suffered a
seizure. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel ordered an emergency shutdown of the
beaches in Chicago because mobs of blacks were terrorizing families. According
to the NBC affiliate there (6/8/2011), a gang of black teens stormed a city
bus, attacked white victims and ran off with their belongings.</font></span></p>

		<p>In exposing the lie he does a great service to non-white victims of black racism, and to all whites, actually. In uncovering the lie, however, he must tell a few lies of his own. Such is the legacy of &#8216;political correctness&rsquo;. Blacks were attacking, expunging, and discriminating against whites back in the good old days &#8216;when white racism ran amuck&rsquo; too. </p>

		<p>A long time ago Lew Rockwell used to run columns by Jared Taylor. Apparently Lew decided that Jared (and some other writers) was too edgy, so he stopped running pieces about race, shied away from immigration, and even scrubbed his archives of Jared&rsquo;s columns.</p>
<p>It is through lewrockwell.com via a link on Karen deCoster&rsquo;s page that I first found my way to AmRen.com. (Sadly, deCoster doesn&rsquo;t link to AmRen anymore.)  </p>
<p>Anyway, glad to see that Lew has finally decided to talk about race again.  This is very good news.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute!  The Chicago Tribune censored the race in the case of stories involving black crime to &#8220;guard against subjecting an entire group to suspicion&#8221;?</p>
<p>They and others in the lame stream media never hesitate to subject the entire white race to suspicion (and vitriol) whenever they can.</p>
<p>A clear admission of a double standard, not that we didn&rsquo;t know about it already.  And these bleeding hearts wonder why white people are so angry.</p>

		<p>As a fan of Steve Martin&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Jerk&rsquo;, I know that black racism is nothing new, as Nathan was instructed by his black father to never trust Whites. This and my experience as a courier in the City of Chicago and member of the military. </p>
<p>What is new is that the election of Obama gives youth a sense of empowerment to act out their impulses. African tribal evolution is patriarchal in nature and a black male President along with the Hope and Change signs seem to be what has given many among this community the feeling of license to go flash mob. This behavior will become more and more prevalent until the call finally comes for order. Then it gets interesting.</p>

		<p><i>Black silence in the face of black racism has to be one of the biggest betrayals of the civil rights struggle that included black and white Americans.</i></p>
<p>I had a different opinion of this story yesterday on my soapbox, but the more I think of it, the more I don&rsquo;t like this article.  Such as this sentence above, it&rsquo;s true if you take out &#8220;betrayals&#8221; and insert &#8220;successes.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t believe the &#8220;civil rights struggle&#8221; was really opposed to &#8220;racism&#8221; in a generic sense, but opposed to white people, white rule and white authority.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my opinion was that it the real tragedy of an op-ed like this is that a black man is writing it, i.e. there aren&rsquo;t fifty white people the average college educated American adult could recognize by name writing the same things.</p>
<p>Williams talks about the Chicago media race censorship.  As luck would have it, I was thinking about it today.  Some AR regulars noted the hypocrisy of media race censorship but telling us the age and gender of suspects and victims.  They said in earnest that to be fair and to eliminate every &#8220;ism,&#8221; every MSM story about crime will have to read something like this:  &#8220;Somebody did something to someone at (location) on (date) at (time of day).&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, I think in order truly to comply with the diktats of social justice, we&rsquo;ll have to go even further than that.  If we say the location, then it&rsquo;s going to be obvious who did it.  If you say it happened in North St. Louis or South Chicago or The Bronx or South Central L.A., or South Phoenix or anywhere in Detroit, that&rsquo;s &#8220;racist dog whistling,&#8221; don&rsquo;t you know?  Same with the time of day:  If this unspecified incident involving unspecified individuals happened at 2:30 AM, then that&rsquo;s coded racism as well. </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t imply that a crime was committed either, because as we all know, whenever politicians want to revoke privileges or rights based on criminal convictions, the entire black caucus gets up and starts whining about disparate impact and how you&rsquo;re picking on blacks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the template for a truly politically correct social justicey MSM (not) crime story, it will have to read like this:</p>
<p><i>Somebody behaved in some manner toward somebody else at some place on some date and time.</i></p>

		<p>The ironic part of this story is what lies behind the silence of other blacks about these cases. Years ago, Whites were also silent about lynchings and perceived injustices done upon blacks. The difference, though, is that it took a huge portion of Whites to overtake what was the societal norms of segregation. No matter how misguided that it turned out to be, I believe they had the most noble of intentions.</p>
<p>If those Whites of 45+ years ago were still alive, or better yet, still empowered politically, I seriously doubt they would support such a move for equality these days. There will be no such large contingency of blacks to help the White man out when he is slighted and persecuted. On the other hand if black power is really what these uneducated brutes want, they should take a look at Zimbabwe, S. Africa, and closer to home, cities like Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, Las Vegas, LA, Atlanta, etc. There will be no handouts to poor blacks from wealthy and powerful blacks. It&rsquo;s an illusion based on false pride. The black leaders will spend on themselves and maybe 1 or 2 &#8220;homies&#8221;. The ones in the &#8216;hood will know their place or be eradicated. Count on it.</p>

<p>Pretty good editorial, except for this line. Unfortunately, the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement was a con game from the very beginning. &#8220;With rights comes responsibility,&#8221; and those constantly demanding the former of the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement were never willing to demonstrate the latter.</p>

		<p>2 Karl Ketzer:</p>
<p>I first became familiar with Sam Francis because of a long profile of him in a monthly magazine that Lew Rockwell once did with the late Murray Rothbard, the Rothbard-Rockwell Report (RRR).  I think it was in 1994, the title was &#8220;The Francisian Way.&#8221;</p>
<p>I count Lew Rockwell as an intellectual idol, not because I&rsquo;m an all-in Anarcho-Capitalist (definitely not), but because I like the way he thinks.  That and for an A-C, he has been very fair if not supportive of PJB and Sam Francis, even though they&rsquo;re hardly A-Cs themselves.</p>
<p>Since Ron Paul is running for President again, we&rsquo;ll probably get to hear about those &#8220;racist&#8221; newsletters of his from the 1980s, his first stint in Congress, 1978-84, that &#8220;bashed&#8221; Martin Luther King.  The &#8220;racist&#8221; and anti-MLK articles were most likely Rockwell-written.</p>
<p>That said, even when Rockwell did &#8220;go there,&#8221; it was never from a white nationalist or race realist perspective, always from an anarcho-capitalist perspective.  His main problem with MLK was that he supported &#8220;big government.&#8221;  Like, Duh, fish also support vast quantities for water for much the same reason.</p>

		<p>I like this guy.  While I applaud some of his observations, I think Jared Taylor has a better handle on these issues: there is a racial difference in behavior, IQ, culture, mannerisms, on and on.  </p>
<p>As someone said, the Civil Rights struggle was not betrayed, it was fulfilled.  The consequences were predicted by the South.  The results of racial tension, lower standards, deteriorating schools, etc., was exactly what the South warned against.  It now has come to fruition.  The South was not against civil rights, but it was a proponent of segregation, for the reasons mentioned.  </p>

		<p>No, the reason the media cencors the perpetrators race when the perp is black is because they need to deceive the public to continue their agenda.  </p>
<p>Those in the media on balance do not represent the general population&rsquo;s beliefs, concerns, etc.  To protect their agenda they must continue to decieve the public about race.</p>
<p>You have the same situation on schools and public education.  The fact is blacks learn at a differnt rate than whites.  They have different apptitudes.  The average 12 grade black student performs at an average white 9 grader.  The behavior is also different.  Blacks are far more likely to be problem students.</p>
<p>These differences must be concealed by the media.</p>

		<p>Government policies involving subsidizing high birth rates among black morons has probably meant we have actually succeeded in breeding the African-American community into a state of retardation.</p>
<p>If the stupidest 50% of blacks have been sterilized consistently over the past century and good behavior had been consistently rewarded (decent wages, decent housing, and most importantly of all, protecting decent blacks from feral ones), we would probably have a pretty decent African-American community by now - not a bunch of geniuses, but generally hard-working, decent, responsible adults.</p>
<p>But no matter what the reasons, the black community has spiraled downward into into a mind-boggling hellhole of chaos, violence and dysfunction, and does not seem to have touched bottom yet. </p>
<p>Given the fact that the totally insane US oligarchy has smashed the economy to bits through globalization, uncontrolled immigration, job off shoring, etc. we can expect things get worse.</p>
<p>The totally insane US corporate oligarchy will wall themselves off in fortified towns, but what about the rest of us? (Obviously, blacks who can afford it are walling themselves off and gated communities as well: no matter what kind of nonsense they spew in public, they have no desire be stabbed by one of their own)</p>
<p>Even the most deluded liberal is eventually jolted awake by the sheer and utter awfulness of typical black behavior.</p>
<p>When close to 50% of the black men in some communities are armed, dangerous, violent felons, it&rsquo;s too late to talk about a couple of bad apples.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also probably time to remeasure black IQ:<br>
I suspect the average has dropped 10 points over the past generation. Many of the new stories posted here are not suggestive of individuals with IQs between 80 and 90, but rather between 60 and 70. </p>
<p>Worse yet, the degeneration of the black race is so utterly mesmerizing that it tends to distract from an even more important issue:<br>
the degeneration of white America into imbecilism and depravity, drug addiction and ignorance - including its ruling class, which seems increasingly to be made up of drug addicted retards. </p>
<p>What are we going to do about that?</p>

It&rsquo;s not just black silence.  What about the deafening silence of the media and officialdom?</p>

		<p>As a long time admirer of Dr. Williams,I am not the least surprised that he wrote a column such as this. Acknowledging the true is the first step to deal with  reality. The true is that whites want to preserve both their culture and race. Most of us don&rsquo;t hate NWM; we see no reason to end Western Civilization just assuage the egos of leftist racists for transgressions of the past. Slavery and mistreatment by one group in power of another is as old as human history; white people were no worst than others. The call for human rights today comes from those members western europe culture. Slavery can be found all over the African continent currently. Which cultural tradition would you prefer?      </p>

		<p>People of lower IQ are usually not as magnanimous as those of higher IQ.  And blacks in general are not even generous with each other.  They&rsquo;re suspicious of other blacks&rsquo; motives and thus tend to be very self-centered.  They usually only stick together when opposing whites.<br>
It will be interesting to see how long it takes them to apply the same worldview to their political relationship with Hispanics.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately for Walter Williams, who would like to see a racial healing, the majority of blacks in this country don&rsquo;t have the capacity for understanding that he does.</p>
<p>Because of that, the situation will continue to head toward critical mass.</p>

		<p>Those that control the media realize that whites are waking up. So, they realize that they have to bend a little so they do not break. I feel some of the recent stories in the media, like the sudden &#8220;cracking down&#8221; on immigration, and the acknowledgement (which is ridiculously overdue) of black on white violence and racism are like pressure release valves. They realize that the pressure i.e. anger is building with our people, so they have to reduce that pressure with these sudden acknowledgements of what we&rsquo;ve known to be true. Don&rsquo;t ever think the media are on our side! </p>

<p>  &mdash;  Fed Up</p>
<p>The power of the state is the root cause of the problem   &mdash;   a state controlled by those whose ultimate goal is White genocide.</p>
<p>This is being carried out via federal courts that refuse to uphold the rights of Whites and openly legislate against us, a media that refuse to report black-on-white murders, rapes and robberies and warn Whites about rampant black crime, and an educational system that vilifies Whites, <i>dehumanizes us</i>, making us, for blacks and other non-Whites, fair game for attack.</p>
<p>This is the insidious triangulation I keep writing about.  None of this would be happening without a complicit state   &mdash;   a state that uses blacks and hispanics as battering rams as part of its strategy to carry out White genocide.</p>
<p>And, where the Internet has been our savior.</p>
<p><i>What are we going to do about that?</i></p>
<p>Good question.  I would suggest spreading the word to everyone you know and care about.  Arm yourself and loved ones, including and especially females.  Teach them to avoid blacks at all costs and be ruthless in the face of black aggression. It&rsquo;s far past time we started fighting back, and in a cold-blooded, callous manner.</p>
<p>We Whites survived harsh conditions in our past by being ruthless and merciless against those who wished to kill us and appropriate what was ours.  This cold-blooded instinct is in us, I&rsquo;m convinced, no matter the media lies. </p>
<p><i>Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of the day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and pursued unalterably through every change of administrators too plainly proves a deliberate, systematic plan of reducing us to slavery.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>I would disagree with Mr. Jefferson that the systematic plan is to reduce us to slavery;  it is to reduce us to ashes.</p>

<p>And, to those who call me &#8220;Cassandra&#8221; or scold me to &#8220;quit whining&#8221;   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s hear what YOU propose to halt our slide into oblivion. </p>

<p>Well, Jefferson was writing about THEN.  What we are confronting is NOW.  It has gotten worse. The elites have changed.</p>

<p>I would not take &#8220;Cassandra&#8221; to be a pejorative name but a highly admirable one.  It implies a wisdom and insight that too many others sadly lack.</p>
<p>Would that we had more Cassandras!</p>

<p>Is there a truly conservative newspaper in any large city in the US? Is there a republican mayor in any city in the US with a population larger than 300,000? All media outlets, but especially big city ones, pander to blacks (at the expense of whites) the way 90 pound white kid pander to blacks at these same inner-city schools. These public officials and newszines are the very ones who should be standing up for whats right. </p>

<p>Oh, just like today we hear they are &#8220;profiled&#8221; and &#8220;innocent&#8221; as well, right?

<p>What isn&rsquo;t told is that <b>lynching was not only done against blacks</b>, nor was it only done by whites. Those lynchings were avenged, one for one. The blacks didn&rsquo;t just sit around crying about it like they would in the movies. But they have appropriately lynching as a cultural myth of black victimization, aided and abetted by a complacent media. </p>
<p>There were plenty of whites lynched too. It&rsquo;s time we took away the lynching card from the Africans in America.</p>

		<p>Bon from the land of babble is right (as usual), and that is one Jefferson quote I have not heard before, thanks for sharing it. Though I think Cassandra is not a slight against you, cassandra&rsquo;s problem was that noone believed her about the future she saw. I am inclined to say that&rsquo;s the people who disbelieve are simply too horrified by the truth and hope that it won&rsquo;t happen. More and more those same people are waking up and telling of the future themselves. I am on your side Bon.<br>
KGB Is also right lynching was gone on both sides, But now we are letting the other side gain too many points over us and I cannot stand it any longer! I live in a place where I can fly my confederate flag, and my neighbors fly theirs too.<br>
 I&rsquo;m with Bon, I say disseminate information and arms. Get the word out not only about crime, but also about Neighborhood demographics for those who have been kept unaware. Print out news and stories and paper the country. I have been thinking that we do not have the same type of media representation so the best option would be to record ourselves in the newscastor manner reading the stories that matter and posting them to every video hosting website we can.</p>

<i>Bon from the land of babble is right (as usual).</i> </p>
<p><br>
Thank you for the kind words.  It&rsquo;s nice to know someone is paying attention!!</p>
<p>I often read about the plight of SAs Whites   &mdash;   here&rsquo;s the latest, dateline June 27, 2011: </p>
<p><i>The ANC-regime is arming its youth league, while the besieged white minority is rapidly being disarmed of their 1,2-million legal self-defence weapons</i></p>
<p><i>all legal guns have to be re-registered by July 31 2011..<br>
 more than half of all the reregistration applications are being turned down, and that 90% are again turned down on appeal.</i> </p>
<p><i>White families are increasingly forced to hand over the only self-defence weapons and ammunition which they still could use legally against the country&rsquo;s many tens of thousands of black criminal gangs.</i> </p>
<p>Stay ever vigilant.  We are alive because our forebearers believed in defending what was theirs with deadly force   &mdash;   they certainly didn&rsquo;t wait for the government to rescue them!!</p>
