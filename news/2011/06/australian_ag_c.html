<h1>Australian AG Condemns Surge in Black Prisoners</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, June 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Australia&rsquo;s attorney general has condemned as unacceptable the burgeoning number of young Aboriginal prisoners that a parliamentary report branded a &#8220;national crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>A report on indigenous youth in the criminal justice system released Monday found Aboriginal children are 28 times more likely than other Australian children to be sent to a juvenile detention center.</p>
<p>Attorney General Robert McClelland said Tuesday that the report would redouble his efforts with state governments to find alternatives to jail, particularly for less serious offenses such as failure to pay fines and unlicensed driving.</p>

		<p>What ought to be seen as unacceptable is not the Aboriginal incarceration rate, but the Aboriginal crime rate.  Focus, mates, on the things those people do that land them in prison in the first place.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised our mates down under cant see the obvious. Got too many black &#8220;youths&#8221; in the criminal justice system?? A rate 28 times higher than others?? You say this is unacceptable?? Simple. Just start dropping the charges against these children of color, no matter how serious or violent the crime. Then start jailing White kids for even the most minor of offenses. If you still don&rsquo;t have enough Whites, just start filing bogus charges against them.</p>
<p>This should even out things in no time and soon the little black darlings wont be &#8220;over represented&#8221; in the criminal justice system. Then all will be well&hellip;..We all know this is where we are headed. Australia can get a jump on the rest of the world.<br>

		<p>Again this is partly a result of the Stone Age clashing with the 21st Century and in many ways is quite tragic.</p>
<p>BUT:</p>
<p>Back in the 60s and 70s the do-gooders made sure Aboriginals were given full civil rights (Sound familiar?) This basically meant they were given access to alcohol and social security payments and the right to live in towns and cities, this has basically been their destruction. </p>
<p>They were told to reject the white man&rsquo;s religion and then all the &#8220;Missions&#8221; were closed down, while the mission system was not perfect it was better than the filthy squatter camps that so many aboriginals live in today.</p>
<p>They are constantly told that the White Man stole their land so aboriginals tend live in a state of hate and resentment to modern Australian society.</p>
<p>They are given free education but very few aboriginals want attend school.</p>
<p>They are given free health care and subsidised housing but most still live in total filth.</p>
<p>They have problems adapting to the 21st century but they seem to have no problems using cell phones and ATMs.</p>

 <br>
The first positive step that could be made to attempt to remedy this problem Mr Attorney General is to stop trying to make, or turn Aboriginals into Whites. I think once our authorities here in Australia get over that obstacle and minimise the supervision of them in their own communities, they can deal with their own mess themselves. One way or another.</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, Australoids make up an even greater percentage of prison populations than do American blacks.  The vast majority of these Australoids, moreover, are addicted to meth.  <br>
The only alternative to imprisonment would logically be apartheid or removal to guarded reservations.  Otherwise, whites in Australia will descend into a new dark age in which they must live behind fortresses and emerge with armies to protect them.</p>

		<p>From what I remember as far as IQ statistics go, Australian Aboriginals are the least intelligent group of people on the planet(sub-saharan pygmy people aside, but I consider pygmies to be a sub-species of humanity so they&rsquo;re not included).</p>
<p>I imagine that any country with a large population of australian abos would have a &#8220;national crisis.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Until the powers-that-be turn around and face the real issue, by, say, noting that Aboriginals are 28 times more likely to commit Crimes, and acting to address that, these problems will likely continue or even rise?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see any possible solution to the Aborigines. Everything has been tried. Nothing works. They can&rsquo;t really function in a modern, technologically advanced society but no Australian government or authorities would ever admit that. And Australia can&rsquo;t roll back a few hundred years of history and become again an almost unpopulated stone age country. The Aborigines and their pathologies are just a burden to be suffered. It would be far better to concentrate on the issues of immigration, asylum abusers and securing borders. Things that CAN be changed and improved. </p>
