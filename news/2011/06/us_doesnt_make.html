<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43287918/ns/business-world_business/">US Doesn&rsquo;t Make Cut for Happiest Nations List</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael B. Sauter et al., MSNBC, June 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What makes people happy? The question, which has been debated by philosophers for centuries, now is being tackled by international bureaucrats and the results are interesting, to say the least.</p>
<p>24/7 Wall St. analyzed the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Better Life Index to objectively determine the happiest countries in the world. The Index is based on 11 measurements of quality of life including housing, income, jobs, community, education, the environment, health, work-life balance, and life satisfaction. We made &#8220;life satisfaction&#8221; the cornerstone of our index because it is as good a proxy for &#8220;happiness&#8221; as the survey provides. We then compared &#8220;life satisfaction&#8221; scores to the other measurements to find those economic and socio-political realities that had the highest and lowest correlation to happiness.</p>
<p>The happiest people in the developed world get loads of social services without having to work too hard. Having abundant natural resources, a thriving services sector and a fairly homogeneous population helps as well. The OECD study no doubt would have had different results had it included politically unstable countries in the Middle East or large emerging economies where political unrest threatens to bubble over such as China.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Old, stable nations of northern Europe took five of the top 10 spots on our list. These include Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark. Switzerland is also on the list and has many characteristics in common with the Scandinavian countries. The resource-rich, English-speaking countries of Australia and Canada made the cut as well. Noticeably absent from the list are any OECD nations in Latin America, southern and eastern Europe and Asia. {snip}</p>

		<p>Another version of this story I read last week states that the U.S. finished in dead last place in this survey.  That doesn&rsquo;t compute with me, for every immigrant we receive is by definition leaving a more happy country for a less happy one.  Why would they want to deprive themselves of happiness?</p>

		<p>Whitey, do you have any happiness left at all?  Our enemies call that &#8220;unearned White privilege,&#8221; and they are dedicated and well funded and fully empowered to steal it or beat it out of you.  A happy Whitey, called a &#8220;raciss,&#8221; is proof positive that the Civil Rights struggle &#8220;has come far, but still has much more work to do&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unless you are miserable and fully dispossessed, you are an obstacle to blacks achieving the American Promise that Jefferson, Washington, Madison, and Lincoln made to them.</p>

		<p>Happiness for yourself is a short term goal indicative of poor social awareness.</p>
<p>Happiness as a belief in the potential of a good future for your children and your kind is a different and ultimately more prophetic, marker of both present status and an understanding of which way the trends in your world are pointing.</p>
<p>Europe will not be a &#8216;happy&rsquo; place if they don&rsquo;t understand that misery in the Mediterranean states with massive influxes of poor African and SWA&rsquo;ian Islamics is sure and certain proof of what their own disastrous population policies are pointed towards.</p>
<p>Sweden, Norway and Finland in particular have gone whole heartedly into the &#8216;Scandinavian Marriage Mode&rsquo; of 1.25-1.6 fertility and limited commitment _from women_ to their their partners as family supporters.</p>
<p>Because the state will provide for almost every aspect of socialized child rearing.  Provided you pay 50-70% taxes to enable it-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Two things prompted the Swedes to take this extra step  &mdash;  the welfare state and cultural attitudes. No Western economy has a higher percentage of public employees, public expenditures  &mdash;  or higher tax rates  &mdash;  than Sweden. The massive Swedish welfare state has largely displaced the family as provider. By guaranteeing jobs and income to every citizen (even children), the welfare state renders each individual independent. It&rsquo;s easier to divorce your spouse when the state will support you instead.</p>
<p>The taxes necessary to support the welfare state have had an enormous impact on the family. With taxes so high, women must work. This reduces the time available for child rearing, thus encouraging the expansion of a day-care system that takes a large part in raising nearly all Swedish children over age one. Here is at least a partial realization of Simone de Beauvoir&rsquo;s dream of an enforced androgyny that pushes women from the home by turning children over to the state.</p>
<p>Yet the Swedish welfare state may encourage traditionalism in one respect. The lone teen pregnancies common in the British and American underclass are rare in Sweden, which has no underclass to speak of. Even when Swedish couples bear a child out of wedlock, they tend to reside together when the child is born. Strong state enforcement of child support is another factor discouraging single motherhood by teens. Whatever the causes, the discouragement of lone motherhood is a short-term effect. Ultimately, mothers and fathers can get along financially alone. So children born out of wedlock are raised, initially, by two cohabiting parents, many of whom later break up.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/bm8cG" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/bm8cG</a></p>
<p>Which is one reason why socialism destroys not just the family but the productivity of the Western Society model.  Because without motive to create long term binding family partnerships, we lose our ability to plan and invest in other areas of society (technical innovation) as well.</p>
<p>Let one thing slip (Norway exhausts it&rsquo;s North Sea oil riches) and the entire socio-economic model of many of these &#8216;idyllic&rsquo; places will _implode_.</p>

===</p>
<p>Reminds of the stunning   &mdash;  - to him   &mdash;  - discovery of liberal political scientist Robert Putnam:</p>
<p>&#8220;A bleak picture of the corrosive effects of ethnic diversity has been revealed in research by Harvard University&rsquo;s Robert Putnam, one of the world&rsquo;s most influential political scientists. His research shows that the more diverse a community is, the less likely its inhabitants are to trust anyone - from their next-door neighbor to the mayor &hellip;&rdquo; (Financial Times, Oct. 8, 2006)* </p>
<p>Putnam: &ldquo;&hellip;in the presence of diversity, we hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it&rsquo;s not just that we don&rsquo;t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don&rsquo;t trust people who do look like us.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Prof. Putnam found trust was lowest in Los Angeles, &#8216;the most diverse human habitation in human history&rsquo; &hellip; When the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, they showed that the more people of different races lived in the same community, the greater the loss of trust.&#8221; </p>

		<p>This article should be dismissed as racist propaganda, and the author fired and blacklisted (along with the editor who approved it) for being so impudent as to suggest that homogeneous countries are more desirable to inhabit than diverse countries.  One would have to be incredibly ignorant if not outright malevolent to deny that diversity enriches life for us all.  Any conclusion to the contrary can only be false. </p>

<p>This article is from the MSNBC website, and so is that abrasive left-winger Chris Matthews who claims to love Obama and diversity but lives in a lily white Maryland suburb. Liberals like him will use the cliche that they want to &#8220;live in a neighborhood with good schools&#8221; etc., as a rational for why they live where they do. They&rsquo;re so blinded by ideology they wouldn&rsquo;t realize the real reasons for why their neighborhoods are so desirable even if it hit them over the head. </p>

		<p>In Nassau County, NY the rallying cry was &#8220;it&rsquo;s a pity we can&rsquo;t live in Garden City&#8221;.  I long for the day when there is an infusion of Section 8 people and the building of low-income and public housing in the white upper-class towns where hypocrites like Chris Matthews live.  And let&rsquo;s hope the media uncovers all the under-the-radar stuff that these spoiled liberals undertake to keep out the people they claim to champion.  Diversity Kills. </p>

 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
&#8220;Homogeneous population,&#8221; is a polite way of saying, &#8220;Nearly everyone is white.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
A generous public sector of the economy helps too. Unfortunately, many blacks will game the system. When welfare benefits became more generous and easier to qualify for during the 1960s hundreds of thousands of blacks quit low wage jobs and went on welfare. Whites are less likely to behave that way.<br>
 <br>
Those who support Social Democracy tend to support immigration policies that make Social Democracy difficult to sustain. I hope they figure that out before it is too late.  </p>

		<p>I live in a neighborhood with mostly asian neighbors, the rest are a motley assortment of immigrants from the rest of the world.  People only make friends by their ethnic/racial group here, thus I have no friends in my home area.  </p>
<p>I work in a neighborhood that is 99% latino.  Everyone speaks Spanish.  Even in the chain restaurants like Subway or McDonalds, NONE of the workers speak English.  I thought at least the manager would speak English.  Nope.  (In both places I&rsquo;ve had to place my orders in my broken Spanish.)  </p>
<p>I do my shopping in a 90%+ italian/irish white neighborhood.  They are mostly second and third generation and maintain many characteristics of their parents and grandparents culture.  As a man of WASP background whose roots go back 4 centuries here, I can&rsquo;t really relate to their niche cultures.  </p>
<p>I am unhappy and distrustful everywhere I go, but at least in the first and the last places I mentioned I don&rsquo;t see any garbage on the ground or fear for my safety. </p>

<p>I worked and lived in Europe for several years.  They have older culture, and a more cohesive population, despite foreigners.  Their social services make them less stressed and more secure. As one friend in Slovenia told me, &#8220;We are like one big family here, so we don&rsquo;t mind paying the higher tax.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s the key, so far, most white Europeans retain the feeling that they are able to rely upon one another, while in the U.S. we are spread out, have suffered with &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; longer, and have a less viable culture that is largely pop-commercial culture than authentic.  From my experience I would say that Euros are much better at friendship, family, and knowing how to enjoy themselves and others than Americans, who are ridden with stubborn individualism, and selfishness, neurotically trying to prove otherwise to a fault.  Euros have their faults, with a funny sort of narcissism of their own, but I would have to admit that they are happier.  Being of the same race, ethnicity and culture, real culture, has much to do with that.</p>

<p>I just saw a Rick Steve&rsquo;s travel show on The Netherlands, last night by chance.  I watched it because I lived there for a month in 1997 and knowing its problems with Muslims and other immigrant issues, I was interested if he would manage another Polly Anna loaded show.  Well, he sure did,  Not one mention of immigration, or its problems, just a often reiterated tout of the Dutch as Europe&rsquo;s most tolerant nation.  I&rsquo;m amazed how his cameramen miss all the dark people for the pretty blonde ones so often.  But he had two wonderful accomplices in his show; a Dutch couple who did a similarly great jog in exemplifying the sort of blinkerism that I have realized actually allows people like the Dutch to live with many objectionable people, ideas, and things; THEY IGNORE WHAT IS UPSETTING.  They call it &#8220;coziness&#8221; they love to look inward to themselves.  I think that is the key, The Dutch, The Danes, smaller countries more, larger countries less, focus inward.  That way, they don&rsquo;t see what they don&rsquo;t like.  They protect their egos by proclaiming tolerance, and their truly great social systems take the stress out of their lives.  They go traveling as a ritual, to prove their own worldliness, but they just act more Dutch than Americans act like Americans, and so on with French, Germans, etc.  As the balance has changed some of them like Denmark, have finally begun to change policies, but I think I finally understand why people like the Dutch can stand living &#8220;elbow to jowl&#8221; with so many creepy people.  I will say that I personally found the Dutch both charming, friendly, and a bit mentally ill - I mean clinically so.  It was too easy to meet up with such cases casually for that to be a problem of personal perception.</p>

		<p>Other than real problems of crime, unemployment and high cost of living and low wages, Americans are unhappy because of the elite divide and conquer tactics.</p>
<p>For a century since the founding of the NAACP by marxist immigrant troublemakers, the elites and our government has gone out of its way to divide Americans and immigrants into ever smaller groups.</p>
<p>Men and women, the different races, the chosen people vs the beasts who walk on 2 legs, gays, bi, mexicans vs guatamaleans vs salvadoreans vs puerto ricans, whacky a do environmentalists on and on the list of federally funded dissident groups grows.</p>
<p>The common theme of all the separatist groups is that &#8220;we are abused and oppressed and discriminated against by the White middle class christian minority.&#8221;  Counting White gays, women and earth worshippers, I would estimate that around 80 percent of the population belongs to a group that considers itself oppressed and discriminated against.</p>
<p>From the marxist billionarie whose grandfather didn&rsquo;t get into the country club of his choice to the Man Boy Love Association child molester who considers that the child molestation laws opress and abuse pedophilos, America is a country divided against itself.  </p>
<p>And it is all funded by our federal government and the federal tax laws that allow anti American subversives to be exempt from taxation as long as they give their money to SPLC, Tides Foundation, ACLU, NOW and all the other organizations that have splintered us into warring groups.</p>

<p>&#8220;America could be the happiest nation on earth under our constituion.&#8221;</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t been living under the constitution for decades now starting with the Civil Rights Act to hate crime laws that give unequal treatment to some groups and not others to the Patriot Act which spies on American citizens.  The increasing diversity in this country will destroy what little constitutional rights we have left.  When there are 450 million people living in this country and open space is at a premium does it seem likely we&rsquo;ll retain the right to own property?  Will it seem wise for people to be allowed to own firearms when the majority of gun owners aren&rsquo;t White?  Sometime in the near future there will be a scramble to maintain law and order through martial law and we will either end up with a 100 percent Marxist controlled government or (hopefully) some form of National Socialism.  You can either be free or you can be diverse.  </p>

		<p>im not at all surprised by this article,  the scandanavian model, while not perfect, is a civilization of compassion, civility and of progress.  we in the white identity movement have to stop automatically aligning ourselves with &#8220;right wing&#8221; free market conservative principles.  I think we have seen what free market capitalism, particularly in a global context has done. a system which necessitates an underclass to function.   sweden is a welfare state indeed, but it is better than what we have here in the so called land of opportunity, and our wonderful system which has left a true unemployment rate at an upwards of 20 percent with millions of our fellow whites falling into poverty and despair. sweden has proven that one can have a system which actually cares for the welfare of it&rsquo;s people without stifling initiative and creating a rationing system.  of course swedens&rsquo; model would never work here though as people, particularly blacks but also many whites have no sense of civic responsibility and would abuse the system to the point where it would be bankrupted.  another reason why people are happy in sweden is, and i&rsquo;m completely serious here, is the abundance of attractive beautiful blonde women. </p>

		<p>Communism failed because it was contrary to basic human nature. Diversity will fail for the same reason. Our basic nature is tribal, and the sooner we recognize that, the better.</p>

		<p>Japan usually scores pretty low on the Happiness Index.  81st, 90th, etc. Oman beat them.  Last year there was a talk show in which Japanese and foreigners discuss the whys and wherefores of the low ranking. </p>
<p>The show listed all of the positive sides of Japanese society.  Low crime, high literacy and education levels and so on.  The flipside is that the Japanese on average worked the most hours per week, have some of the longest commutes and take the shortest vacations.  Funny thing, the Japanese wwere puzzled by their low ranking and the foreigners on the panel had to point out the grueling work schedule and high suicide rate. </p>
<p>End result is an increase in mental illness, divorce and other social ills.  Add to that crushing debt (over 200% of GDP), rising unemployment and short-sighted business and political leaders who do nothing about the problems.  </p>
<p>Socio-cultural cohesion through monoculturalism definitely helps to build a productive happy society, but it is not everything.  Takes a bit more.  Sufficient sleep and leisure time, vacations, hobbies, spending time with one&rsquo;s family are needed as well.</p>

		<p>Who knows if this study is true - think it&rsquo;s kind of arbitrary in my opinion. On the flip side of that - it&rsquo;s sort of accurate, meaning these happy countries aren&rsquo;t in cultural turmoil (yet) coupled with low crime rates and somewhat gentle governments that don&rsquo;t act like a police state. </p>
<p>Here in the US, you have to worry about lots of things that can make anyone unhappy. It&rsquo;s a country in decline with third world types taking over. It&rsquo;s has a strong police state with liberties being taken away. It has a more centralized govt. with centralized soviet style planning, and people are detached from the govt. What I mean in the last sentence is that I don&rsquo;t think most voters really care. Americans are conditioned to entitlements and goodies and are more worried about goodies in the future than future generations. &#8220;Deficits be damned, I want my govt. benefit, and the hell with future generations that have to pay for it&#8221; is the attitude of most. </p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why the US isn&rsquo;t all that happy in general.</p>

		<p>BAW #29: Communism didn&rsquo;t fail. They repackaged it and called it Environmentalism, among so may other freakish groups. </p>
<p>Communism is still alive and well in the heart of the UN. And for a History lesson on Communism and what they have done to true American Heroes, I suggest the book, &#8220;The Life of John Birch&#8221; by Robert H.W. Welch, Jr. </p>
