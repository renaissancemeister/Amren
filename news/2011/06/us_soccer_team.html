			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), June 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If the U.S. soccer team were hoping for the home advantage during Saturday&rsquo;s Gold Cup final then they were in for a nasty surprise.</p>
<p>Despite being the &#8216;home&rsquo; side in California&rsquo;s Rose Bowl stadium, the majority of fans  &mdash;  most of them American born of naturalized Mexicans  &mdash;  booed and jeered the U.S. team.</p>
<p>The surprising scenes were followed by angry outbursts from U.S. team goalkeeper Tim Howard, who was visibly shaken after the entire post match ceremony was conducted in Spanish.</p>
<p>Speaking after the game, Howard said: &#8216;[tournament organisers] CONCACAF should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think it was a [expletive] disgrace that the entire post match ceremony was in Spanish.</p>
<p>&#8216;You can bet your ass that if we were in Mexico City, it wouldn&rsquo;t be all in English.</p>
<p>&#8216;It never ceases to amaze me all that stuff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tempering his comments, the ex-Manchester United keeper added: &#8216;It was a good crowd today.</p>
<p>&#8216;They were up for it, doing the wave, it was what we expected. We know it&rsquo;s going to be like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking to the LA Times, Mexican supporter Victor Sanchez said: &#8216;I love this country, it has given me everything that I have, and I&rsquo;m proud to be part of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The 37-year-old Monrovia resident reflected the sentiment of most of the 93,000 strong crowd when he added: &#8216;But yet, I didn&rsquo;t have a choice to come here, I was born in Mexico, and that is where my heart will always be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite the remarkable support for the Mexican side, head coach of the U.S. team Bob Bradley told reporters after the game his team was expecting the hostile crowd.</p>
<p>&#8216;Obviously &hellip; the support that Mexico has on the night like tonight makes it a home game for them.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s part of something we have to deal with on the night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking to the Times, American fan Roy Martinez was one of the few supporters present actually supporting the U.S.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I know, it&rsquo;s strange, and when we got here, we were a little worried.  </p>
<p>Wrapped in an American flag he led USA cheers outside the stadium, trying to gee up the home side.</p>
<p>The game came after it emerged this week ethnic minorities now make up the majority of babies in the United States.</p>
<p>It is the first time that this has been the case and the change reflects a growing age divide between mostly white, older Americans and predominantly minority youths that could reshape government policies.</p>
<p>Preliminary census estimates also show the share of African-American households headed by women  &mdash;  made up of mostly single mothers  &mdash;  now exceeds African-American households with married couples, a sign of declining U.S. marriages overall but also continuing challenges for black youths without involved fathers.</p>
<p>The findings, based on the latest government data, offer a preview of final 2010 census results being released this summer that provide detailed breakdowns by age, race and householder relationships such as same-sex couples.</p>
<p>Demographers say the numbers provide the clearest confirmation yet of a changing social order, one in which racial and ethnic minorities will become the U.S. majority by the middle of the century.</p>
<p>Currently, non-Hispanic whites make up just under half of all three-year-olds, which is the youngest age group shown in the Census Bureau&rsquo;s October 2009 annual survey, its most recent. </p>
<p>In 1990, more than 60 per cent of children in that age group were white.</p>
<p>Long after the game finished Mexico supporters remained, bouncing up and down as they chanted and cheered for their team.</p>
<p>The American&rsquo;s were not even spared in the trophy ceremony after Mexico&rsquo;s 4-2 win  &mdash;  booed for one final time as they were announced as runners up.</p>
<p>Speaking after the game, another fan summed up the mood for many American-Mexican fans.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;We&rsquo;re not booing the country, we&rsquo;re booing the team.</p>
<p>&#8216;There is a big difference.&rsquo;</p>

								<h2>In Gold Cup Final, It&rsquo;s Red, White and Boo Again</h2>
						<p><small><em>Bill Plaschke, Los Angeles Times, June 25, 2011</em></small></p>
<p>It was imperfectly odd. It was strangely unsettling. It was uniquely American.</p>
<p>On a balmy early Saturday summer evening, the U.S soccer team played for a prestigious championship in a U.S. stadium &hellip; and was smothered in boos.</p>
<p>Its fans were vastly outnumbered. Its goalkeeper was bathed in a chanted obscenity. Even its national anthem was filled with the blowing of air horns and bouncing of beach balls.</p>
<p>Most of these hostile visitors didn&rsquo;t live in another country. Most, in fact, were not visitors at all, many of them being U.S. residents whose lives are here but whose sporting souls remain elsewhere.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even when the U.S. scored the first two goals, the Mexico cheers stayed strong, perhaps inspiring El Tri to four consecutive goals against a U.S. team that seemed dazed and confused. Then when it ended, and the Mexican players had danced across the center of the field in giddy wonder while the U.S. players had staggered to the sidelines in disillusionment, the madness continued.</p>
<p>Because nobody left. Rather amazingly, the Mexico fans kept bouncing and cheering under headbands and sombreros, nobody moving an inch, the giant Rose Bowl jammed for a postgame trophy ceremony for perhaps the first time in its history.</p>
<p>And, yes, when the U.S. team was announced one final time, it was once again booed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> &#8220;I know, it&rsquo;s strange, and when we got here, we were a little worried,&#8221; said Roy Martinez, a U.S. fan who wrapped himself in an American flag and led &#8220;USA&#8221; cheers to passing cars outside the stadium before the game. &#8220;But, you know, it works.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was truly strange but, in the end, it indeed worked, perhaps because there is pride in living in one of the only countries where it could work.</p>
<p>How many places are so diverse that it could fill football stadiums with folks whose roots are somewhere else? How many places offer such a freedom of speech that someone can display an American flag on their porch one day and cheer against the flag the next?</p>
<p>I hated it, but I loved it. I was felt as if I was in a strange place, and yet I felt right at home.</p>

		<p>A miniature of this happened to me when I still lived in California, Northern California in 2002.  I worked in a clinic that served the Hispanic community and all the staff we Mexican females.  The same matchup occurred and when the Mexican team lost, one of them was going on and on about it.  I told her that now she could root for the U.S. team.  She got really made, went to the boss, who was white, accusing me of racism.  I told the boss that she didn&rsquo;t know the difference between racism and nationalism.  Later I found a huge amount of corruption, fraud at the clinic and quit.  It was an awful experience and finished off any tolerance I had for Hispanics in the U.S. completely.  And I had already taken a lot, even burglaries.  I won&rsquo;t enter a Mexican restaurant or buy any product from there if I can help it.</p>

		<p>It is news stories such as this one-and the one about the movie &#8220;Machete&#8221;-that exposes 1) the double-very doubled actually- standard and the very nasty intentions that the race-replacement enthusiasts harbor towards the Native Born White American Majority. Jared Tayor should use this news story-along with the one about the movie &#8220;Machete&#8221;-and run with it in a &#8220;debate&#8221; with the race-replacement enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Here is the crucial point. The Tea Partiers are compared to Adolf Hitler  because the Tea Party may have slightly hinted at some kind of nascent White Identity poltics. What occured at this soccer game in LA was a full-blown  expression of Mexican racial nationalism on American soil. To be honest, it was a declaration of a race war by Mexican invaders on US soil against the Native Born White American Majority. And this full-blown  expression of Mexican racial nationalism on US soil is supported and encouraged by liberal and corporate race-replacement enthusiasts such as Chris &#8216;tingle up my leg Mathews,Kieth Oberman, the Republican Party and the Deocratic Party, Noam Chomsky and Alexander Cockburn.</p>
<p>None of the above race-replacement enthusiasts should be the least bit shocked when the Native Born White American Majority starts expressing themselves openly in highly full-blown racial nationalist way, for it is long overdue. It is just a question of the triggering events occuring that will ignite Native Born White American Racial Nationalsim.</p>
<p>What I have just written is exactly how Jared Taylor put the issue when he appears on RT  or any other major media outlet. It is long overdue..very long overdue.</p>

		<p>It probably is much worse than reported. The cursing, the name calling, the throwing of things, the threats, the just plain obscene and foul behavior was probably overwhelming. Some time ago they had one of these games and staged it in Columbus OH so that crowd would be much smaller but at least less rowdy.</p>
<p>And it is correct too, if American fans tried this sort of thing in Mexico City or any other venue in Mex, those fans might actually be killed or nearly killed.</p>
<p>These reports almost seem to suggest that this is all a good thing. That the diversity is so good that bad behavior, a total lack of sportsmanship in a perverse way that we should be proud such stuff is tolerated.</p>
<p>And yes, the Mexican is so proud. They are a proud people. Very very proud. And they have so much to be proud of. As evidenced by their behavior at this soccer game.</p>
<p>To them it is not just a game, it is victory over the gringo!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not part of it. You are an invader and parasite, brought here by the hatred of the democrat party in an effort to ethnically cleanse Whites, because White Americans don&rsquo;t typically want to give these ignorant politicians control over all of our lives. Instead of playing by the rules, it&rsquo;s much easier to go over the people&rsquo;s heads and replace them with a people who don&rsquo;t mind corruption. Like you.</p>

<p><br>
Well, you have a choice about remaining.</p>
<p>&#8221; I was born in Mexico, and that is where my heart will always be.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>When can we expect you to get the hell out of OUR country, and go back to your homeland?</p>
<p>The guy is basically telling you he&rsquo;s not American, how much more obvious can it be? How can these idiot journalists call such behavior &#8220;uniquely American&#8221;?</p>

		<p>These events are, or at least ought to be, excruciatingly humiliating to white Americans. To argue &#8220;We don&rsquo;t care for soccer anyway&#8221;, is really lame. If the men who landed at Normandy had known this would happen one day, would they have bothered to advance ten yards up the beach?</p>

<p>What, pray tell, is good about any of that? I can&rsquo;t believe the verbal contortions hacks like this guy will go to in order to support even the most weird and debilitating effects of a multicultural society. One that was not asked for, or wanted by a vast majority of the people it was foisted upon. But it&rsquo;s not Mexico I&rsquo;m angry at, it&rsquo;s only the people that live there and forced their offspring on the United States. I&rsquo;d like to suggest they take their soccer balls and go back to where their hearts are. Unbelievable. </p>

		<p>What do you call a place where the United States and Mexico play a game of sport, around eighty thousand of the some ninety-three thousand fans are Mexicans cheering for Mexico, where some of those 80,000 Mexican fans were booing the American goalkeeper, where most of those 80k were blowing air horns and vuvuzelas and bouncing beach balls during the American national anthem, where the entirety of the on-field post-game ceremonies and tournament trophy presentation was conducted in Spanish, and where most of the surrounding area&rsquo;s residents were jubilant when Mexico won the game?</p>
<p>Most people would call it Mexico.</p>
<p>We used to call it Pasadena, California, part of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, Republocrats.</p>

		<p>You know what I love? I love the word &#8220;Mexifornia.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a lovely word. A descriptive word. It neatly encapsulates the entire race and immicration problem in just ten letters.</p>
<p> I want to see this word become &#8220;mainstream&#8221; in the near future. I want to see the day when everyone has heard of this word, when it rolls easily off everyone&rsquo;s lips. We awakened whites need more words like this. </p>
<p>The lefties have been viciously using words against us for half a century or more, words like &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;white supremacist.&#8221; It&rsquo;s time we awakened whites started to fight back.</p>
<p>We need a few words that cannot in any way be called &#8220;slurs,&#8221; but that paint a more vivid picture of what is happening to this country than anything the leftists can come up with. This word delightfully falls into that category.</p>

		<p>As the second article posted stated, this has happened several times in recent years. Soccer games draw many more Mexicans that Americans and their hatred for America, which is only good enough to provide them with jobs and welfare checks, is quite obvious. Being total hypocrites, the same people would protest being deported. </p>

		<p>Eventually it won&rsquo;t be sporting conflicts it will be the real thing. Whites need to wake up and research all they can about our demographic crisis and where we are all headed. Whites should research the ongoing genocide toward the White South Africans to see what happens when Whites become the minority. Whites need to become politically active soon. Perhaps we can set aside a territory specifically for Whites where are people can go and increase are racial stock unmixed. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to cede any part of our country, but just that we will make no-go-zones so a certain percentage can increase our numbers.</p>

		<p>In my opinion, soccer is pretty much a foreign sport. I&rsquo;m not saying it isn&rsquo;t an interesting or challenging sport. I know that a lot of Americans play it, and there seems to have been a push during the last ten or so years to popularize it. We have our own sports. I take a dim view of what professional sports have become, and I don&rsquo;t patronize them. but if I did, soccer would be on the bottom of my list. </p>

		<p>El Tri need to keep their fans in check.  If Chicharito came out with a statement, it might have some impact.  In years past, I have had a place in my heart for the Mexican team, but this shabby behavior by the fans makes it harder to do that.  CONCACAF also need to say they are sorry.  Their are other English-speaking teams in the tournament i.e. Jamaica,  Spanish-only is an affront to them.</p>
<p>Tim Howard is right.  He must have been pretty angry to curse about it.  He is a Christian and a gentleman, but I understand his frustration.  </p>
<p>Someone needs to tell the US coach that Defense is important.  We only seem to look at that aspect of the game as an afterthought.  Look at the difference between having Bundesliga defender Cherundolo in the back and compare with our performance without him.</p>

How many places offer such a freedom of speech that someone can display an American flag on their porch one day and cheer against the flag the next?&rdquo;  How many governments are so rotten to the core that they betray their own people (Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965) and choose their own race for extinction? <br>

&ldquo;I hated it, but I loved it. I was felt as if I was in a strange place, and yet I felt right at home.&rdquo;  This type of individual always feels right at home until he or she becomes a victim of this treacherous diversity; then, he or she is the loudest to scream.    <br>

		<p>I can not help &#8220;defend&#8221; the Mexicans. They ruined their nation, as they ruin any area, and thus they must move into white areas to have a civilization that can feed them. We are the stupid ones. They are the smart ones.</p>
<p>They ruined Miami (Cubans&hellip;same thing). As a child, my family moved out of Miami/Dade county around 1965 since the influx destroyed the school my brother, sister and I attended. We moved and then, with the forced integration with Blacks, we moved again in the early 70s to avoid the violence.</p>
<p>I presently live in an area of Florida which is about 90% white (but dropping fast) and we (entire family and I) are already planning a move. BUT, where? My wife and I want to retire in the whitest area of the US but what about my children?</p>
<p>We are all looking at moving out of the US. Perhaps back to Wales where my family originated from, knowing even now the &#8220;world plan&#8221; is to bring Arabs and Africans even to Wales. We figure we will get one more generation of a white area before either the white race is exterminated or the whites wake up and fight back.</p>
<p>It is only a matter of time before there is real and serious violence.</p>

<p>Such absurd self-delusion can only be found in the far left and the far right.  I am old enough to have been around in the 1980s, and I didn&rsquo;t approve of the USSR&rsquo;s foreign policy.  Never once did it occur to me to go live in the &#8220;evil empire&#8221;, illegaly get a job, and root against local sports teams.</p>
<p>To deny that Mexican hatred is motivated by language, culture, and ethinicity is naive in the extreme.  Pie-in-the-sky libertarians are perfectly content with open-borders as long as their ivory tower think tank positions are unharmed.  Those of us in the real world have a different perspective.

<p><br>
What makes this LA Times traitor Plaschke think that ANY of these screaming, swearing hispanics display the US flags at their homes? Out of that Rose Bowl crowd of 80,000+, I&rsquo;m guessing the number of mestizos who fly the Stars and Stripes over their front door is between Zero and One. Many, MANY Mexicans in SoCal fly the Mex flag   &mdash;   and ONLY the Mex flag   &mdash;   on their houses. They know they can get away with it because no white will EVER tell them to take it down (or at least show a modicum of respect by flying it BELOW the American flag). </p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;I hated it, but I loved it. I was felt as if I was in a strange place, and yet I felt right at home.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
You won&rsquo;t feel nearly so &#8220;right at home&#8221; once your state becomes Mexifornia in law as well as in fact. You won&rsquo;t &#8220;love it&#8221; once you&rsquo;re part of a despised minority, whose &#8220;history of racism&#8221; will be blamed for anything and everything that goes wrong with the new brown-power &#8220;nation&#8221; of Baja Norte. When Mexicans screw up the Golden State exactly the way they screwed up Mexico, and whites get the blame, your new Mexican overlords will NOT distinguish between &#8220;good&#8221; gringos (like Plaschke imagines himself to be) and &#8220;bad&#8221; gringos. To La Raza, there are no good gringos; only bad gringos. </p>

		<p>Victor Davis Hanson ran a similar story on National Review and I remember some of the article&lsquo;s commentators bent overboard to excuse Mexican/Chicano misbehavior. One said that Italian-Americans acted the same why in Italy when the American soccer team played Italy. I can&rsquo;t help but think that the numbers and vehemence of the fans were in no way similar. I doubt the small number of Italian American fans at the game tried to interrupt the United States Anthem with air horns and vuvuzelas?  But such is the liberal belief in the benefits of diversity that any excuse, no matter how illogical and desperate, must be used to prevent cognitive dissonance.</p>

		<p>The proportion of Mexico-rooting soccer fans in the LA stadium is misleading, because soccer is not really an American sport, so those in the stadium are most likely to unassimilated foreigners anyway.  Once they assimilate (hoping some at least eventually will), they move on to watching football, baseball, basketball, even hockey.  Assimilated Americans would rarely be at a soccer game, regardless of which team they would root for. <br>

		<p>I was at this game and this story is wrong. Most of the Mexicans that attended the game were not American born or they did not live in the US. They were actual Mexicans from Mexico; I know this because there were bus loads of people that came up from Mexico. I also saw hundreds of cars parked in the stadium&rsquo;s parking lot and around the area that displayed Mexican license plates. I can also tell when someone is from Mexico, the Mexicans that were there dressed differently than Mexican-Americans.  I am sure some of them were living in the US or born here, but the majority were Mexican nationals.</p>

		<p>I live in Orange County. I used to drive to LA several times a week for business and recreation. You must know that not every Mexican is evil and racist. There are some in our lives that we like very much. When I lived in LA, some of my Mexican neighbors were exceptionally nice to me. I am not a liberal, this really happened. My problem is third world drivers in LA. They are usually Mexican, but they could be Arabic or Russian or other. Every time I am in LA, I am almost killed by a third world driver. It is usually road rage mixed with a very childish mentality. It happens in OC as well, but it&rsquo;s much worse in LA. One of the Mexican janitors in my building lost two nephews last year to traffic accidents caused by such people. One of the Mexican women in my martial arts class similarly lost her husband in a road rage incident. They basically agree with me. The janitor stays out of LA and Mexico, and that woman simply stays away from other Mexicans&hellip;&#8221;muy peligroso&#8221; as they stated.  I don&rsquo;t travel to LA anymore. The roads are too dangerous and the crime is too high. I can take the train to some parts, but I&rsquo;ve almost been hit while crossing the street. Vuvuzelas and booing won&rsquo;t kill you, but bad driving mixed with anti-white racism is very deadly. The few whites I knew that still live there have become drug addicts. I don&rsquo;t want to visit them either. You would have to be on drugs to live in that mess.</p>

<p>Like I said a few days ago when a Lew Rockwell story became an AR story, I like the way he thinks, but I don&rsquo;t agree with him and his brand of anarcho-libertarian-capitalism entirely.  He&rsquo;s just being ideologically arrogant in presuming that all the Mexicans at the Rose Bowl must have read Murray Rothbard or Ludwig Von Mises, and that gave them the motivation to boo the American team and cheer &#8220;the opposition.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s nothing more than they&rsquo;re Mexican, their feeble minds have been filled with anti-white propaganda, the &#8220;old country&#8221; is right next door, and more subtle than that, as Sam Francis and James Lincoln Collier have pointed out, the informal social mechanisms of the past that &#8220;encouraged&#8221; white ethnic immigrants of the past to assimilate have now been turned into civil rights violations, so they&rsquo;re not available to force Mexicans to become Americans, even if such a thing were feasible or desirable.</p>

<p>I get your point about the teaser to Pat&rsquo;s article which I noted also.  I believe Lewrockwell is libertarian. True believing  libertarians are open border proponents which explains the  introduction to Pat&rsquo;s comments to some degree at least. </p>
<p>Additionally, according to the &#8220;Loopies&#8221;, the animosity that jihadists and Mexicans have against the US is deserved because of the empire built by NEOCON imperialists. In the cycloptic eye of the Rockwell Libertarian, the NEOCON is the center of evil in the universe. They have discovered the source of all sin.      </p>
<p>Lewrockwell justifiably takes a lot of shots at RepubliCONs. Yet leftists Demorats, the real totalitarians of our age, seemingly are almost never mentioned. </p>
<p>Nor have I ever seen an article on Lewrockwell critical of the 7th century totalitarian cult called Islam, or of the invading Mexican hordes. (They may exist, but on my rare visits to Lewrockwell I haven&rsquo;t seen any).</p>
<p>Concerning the soccer match, a similar disgraceful display by Mexicans occurred in LA during the 90&rsquo;s.  I think after that California passed a referendum prohibiting state money to illegals.  But, naturally, a thug in black robes, like the nitwit &#8220;judge&#8221; Susan Bolton of Arizona, invalidated the law.   </p>
<p>The California governor at the time, Grey Out Davis,refused to appeal the thug&rsquo;s ruling.  </p>
<p>My guess is that the 80000 or so fans at the soccer match were illegals.  Soccer hasn&rsquo;t gone over big in the US. It won&rsquo;t draw that many US fans. </p>
<p>As a white boy growing up on the US border with Mexico I know that Mexican-Americans are no big fans of soccer. </p>
<p>In my day the Mexican kids were crazy about American football and couldn&rsquo;t wait for the season to start each fall.  Baseball was another American sport we all played in High School. Soccer wasn&rsquo;t given a second thought.</p>
<p>Ironically, just across the border in Mexico, soccer was all the rage (along with bullfighting). </p>

		<p>As recently as 1970 California was 80% white. Southern California in particular, used to be renowned for its huge numbers of white children and teenagers. Recall all those &#8216;beach&rsquo; movies from the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s. I just watched the sci-fi move THEM. It was made in 1954 and about half the move is filmed in Los Angeles. There were many shots of busy, crowded, streets. EVERYBODY was white. I saw one single colored person in the whole film. A black guy who was a shoe-shiner. An event like this would have seemed inconceivable to those people at that time.</p>

<p>I suspect Italy at the time did not have 20+ million illegal invaders from America squatting in their country illegally; demanding privileges and benefits reserved for legal citizens of Italy. Had that been the case, I can assure you your experience would have likely been much different. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the soccer game that&rsquo;s the problem here. It&rsquo;s 20 million illegal invaders, largely from Mexico, who are becoming more militant, demanding, as well as aggressive in their efforts to carry out reconquista.</p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s not just this one soccer game that is calling into question the lack of patriotism and assimilation among Mexican immigrants. There are so many Hispanic people living in Southern California that many are not bothering to learn English or adopt American culture. Organizations like La Raza and MEchA have called for the creation of &#8220;Aztlan&#8221; or a new &#8220;Bronze&#8221; Continent. Many of these militant newcomers are Mexican irredentists, anxious to renounce the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and are very vocal in demanding group rights and denouncing &ldquo;Anglo&#8221; America. Although they don&rsquo;t, at present, speak for the majority of Chicanos, their growing influence and the demographic changes in the Southwest point to a future Quebec Provence within the United States.</p>
