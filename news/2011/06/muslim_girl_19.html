<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1392454/Muslim-girl-Katya-Koren-19-stoned-death-beauty-contest-Ukraine.html">Muslim Girl, 19, &#8216;Stoned to Death After Taking Part in Beauty Contest&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Will Stewart, Daily Mail (London), May 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A teenage Muslim girl was stoned to death under &#8216;Sharia law&rsquo; after taking part in a beauty contest in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Katya Koren, 19, was found dead in a village in the Crimea region near her home.</p>
<p>Friends said she liked wearing fashionable clothes and had come seventh in a beauty contest.</p>
<p>Her battered body was buried in a forest and was found a week after she disappeared.</p>
<p>Police have opened a murder investigation and are looking into claims that three Muslim youths killed her, claiming her death was justified under Islam.</p>
<p>One of the three - named as 16-year-old Bihal Gaziev - is under arrest and told police that Katya had &#8216;violated the laws of Sharia&rsquo;. Gaziev has said he has no regrets about her death.</p>
<p>Stoning is a divisive subject among Muslims, with some groups interpreting it as Islamic law and others disagreeing.</p>
<p>According to Amnesty International&rsquo;s annual report on death sentences worldwide, issued in April, there were no reports of judicial executions carried out by stoning in 2010.</p>
<p>However, new death sentences by stoning were reportedly imposed in Iran, the Bauchi state of Nigeria and Pakistan.</p>
<p>At least 10 women and four men remained under sentence of death by stoning at the end of the year in Iran, where adultery is the only crime which carries that penalty under Sharia law.</p>
<p>It was widely imposed as a sentence in the years following the 1979 Islamic revolution, and even though Iran&rsquo;s judiciary still regularly hands down such sentences, they are now often converted to other punishments.</p>
<p>The barbaric practice was thrown into the international spotlight last year when an Iranian woman, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery after suffering years of abuse at the hands of her drug addict husband.</p>
<p>Miss Ashtiani&rsquo;s lawyer said she was allegedly beaten and sold for sex by opium-addict Ebrahim Ghaderzade, who she is accused of killing.</p>
<p>She was jailed for ten years for murder and sentenced to death for adultery. She was also convicted of having illicit relations for which she received 99 lashes.</p>
<p>The Iranian authorities eventually suspended the stoning after an outcry from the international community.</p>
<p>The European Union has called the sentence &#8216;barbaric&rsquo;, the Vatican pleaded for clemency and Brazil, which has tried to intervene in Iran&rsquo;s stand-off with the West over its nuclear programme, offered Miss Ashtiani asylum.</p>
<p>A number of celebrities, including Robert Redford, Robert De Niro and Sting called for her release in an open letter to the Iranian regime, backed by more than 80 actors, artists, musicians, academics and politicians.</p>
<p>When Carla Bruni, the French First Lady, prominently gave her support to the 43-year-old mother-of-two, Iran responded by launching two scathing attacks on Miss Bruni, branding her an adulteress with a &#8216;vastly immoral lifestyle&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Last week Amnesty international called for &#8216;clarification&rsquo; on the legal status of a jailed lawyer who represented Miss Ashtiani, Javid Houtan Kiyan.</p>
<p>It issued a statement that read: &#8216;If  &mdash;  as appears - he is held solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression, including in connection with his work as a defence lawyer on behalf of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, he should be released immediately and unconditionally.</p>
<p>&#8216;The allegations that he has been tortured while in detention should be investigated immediately and anyone found responsible for abuses brought to justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Islamic republic says the death penalty is essential to maintain law and order and is applied only after exhaustive judicial proceedings.</p>
<p>Murder, rape, armed robbery, drug trafficking and adultery are all punishable by death in Iran.</p>
<p>In March, Iran hanged a woman convicted of murdering a love rival.</p>
<p>Shahla Jahed, 40, had been a &#8216;temporary wife&rsquo; of Nasser Mohammad Khani, a former striker for the Iranian national football team.</p>
<p>The execution was thought to be the 146th so far this year. At least 270 people were executed in 2009.</p>

		<p>Probably Crimean tartars.  While this might be the first time we&rsquo;ve heard about it, I doubt it&rsquo;s the first time this has happened.  Girls dying in some off the back roads Muslim village in the middle of nowhere doesn&rsquo;t often make the news, and there are plenty of such villages in certain eastern European countries.</p>

		<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s been an update to the story.  Turns out a lovesick classmate killed her with a knife and a rock for spurning his advances.</p>

<p>Maybe we can get Robert Redford to write a letter to blacks to get to them to stop killing so many white and Asian people!  </p>

		<p>Crimean Tatars are not native east Euros, but Turkish invaders from Central Asia. </p>
<p>Still I am not surprised that this turned out to be a love-murder rather than a classic &#8220;sharia&#8221; killing (though it may have been justified as such). Muslim groups in Europe with history from before WWII tend to be very secularized (though Islam is part of their national identities, similar to Protestantism for Ulstermen). Newer migrants, and Arabs/Pakastanis/Afghans generally, tend to be far more devout. </p>

<p>  The unfortunate girl doesn&rsquo;t physically resemble the Crimean Tartars that I saw during my visit to the Ukraine. She doesn&rsquo;t have the pronounced Asiatic look or light skin of most of the Tartars. I look upon the Crimean Tartars as a harmless people. My guess is her ancestors are probably originally from Azerbaijan or some other Central Asian Republic. Her figure and eyes are more like the women from that region. Traditionally, the Tatars are not Islamic fundamentalists. Her death is a tragedy and it was probably due to jealousy on the part of a former boyfriend or crazy admirer. </p>

<p>&#8220;Murder, rape, armed robbery, drug trafficking and adultery are all punishable by death in Iran.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Don&rsquo;t forget homosexuality   &mdash;   which, according to Iran&rsquo;s leader Ahmadinijad, &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t exist&#8221; in his country (largely because all Iranian homosexuals are either deeply closeted or have already been hanged). </p>
<p>Also: why is it that the ONLY attractive Muslim women I ever see are always in the Obituary column?</p>

		<p>Madness.  She may not be white but she is certainly full of life and did not deserve a court of three just for being aware of that prettiness.</p>
<p>It never fails to amaze me how these &#8216;proud to have done its&rsquo; also manage to achieve their ends only covertly and the body has to be found in the woods, later.  If it was a decision by the entire town or region, there would not have been a remote burial or three accuseds.  Indeed, the authorities likely would never have been notified.</p>
<p>At the same time, such women as Mz. Koren are engaging in an act of rebellion against social norms which are very old and will likely never change without outside intervention.  They must surely be aware of the consequences and I wonder at how the woman thought she would survive the open hostility against her upon returning to her home town.</p>
<p>The other women are more victims in the traditional sense in that there was no right thing for them to do under Sharia.</p>
<p>Power corrupts.  But Islam subsumes power under &#8216;universal law&rsquo; which is both moral and judicial and so is absolute in it&rsquo;s applied corruption.</p>
<p>That is why Islam must not be allowed to cross our borders.  Becaue it preaches what can only be deemed a bridge across the separations of powers which traditionally have kept us safe from extremist behaviors.</p>
