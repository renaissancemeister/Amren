<h1>Father and Son Charged in Holdup on Father&rsquo;s Day</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael P. McConnell, The Macomb Daily, June 21, 2011  </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A father and son from Flint were arrested together on Father&rsquo;s Day after police say they teamed up in the armed robbery of a Ferndale man.</p>
<p>Beinville H. Alexander, 45, and Beinville H. Alexander II, 21, were arraigned Monday before Ferndale 43rd District Magistrate James Brennan. The father is charged with armed robbery and felony firearm charges and jailed on $75,000 cash bond. His son is jailed on $25,000 cash bond on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>Police said the father committed the armed robbery and his son briefly drove the getaway car before the suspects were stopped and arrested.</p>
<p>A Ferndale man, 55, flagged down a patrol car about 4:30 a.m. Sunday and told police he had just been robbed at gunpoint of $12 near a public parking lot at Nine Mile and Woodward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Recovered from the car were a Smith &amp; Wesson semiautomatic handgun and a Winchester shotgun, both loaded,&#8221; [Detective John] Thull said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The man who was robbed later told police he was walking from the parking lot where he parked his car when the older suspect walked up behind him and pressed a semiautomatic handgun against his back.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Maybe it is better that black boys don&rsquo;t have their fathers around. It shows their behavior is nature rather than nurture.</p>

		<p>Nothing like a good father-son outing to stay close. Remember, the family that robs together, stays together. Even if it is only in the same prison. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Who says blacks don&rsquo;t celebrate Father&rsquo;s Day?&#8221;</p>
<p>That reminds me of a joke. What&rsquo;s the most confusing day in Harlem? Father&rsquo;s day.</p>

<p>Old Dad is introducing his son to making some BIG scores.</p>
<p>Pretty soon he&rsquo;ll take him on a robbery where they can net as high as $20.</p>
<p>When they finally reach the big time, they&rsquo;ll be snatching purses.</p>

		<p>First you must do dna testing to validate the father/son relationship.  This is an anomaly in itself.</p>
<p>Nothing else about this story is remarkable, even the fact this man was at a park at 4:30AM.</p>

Well, the THINK they are father and son.  A trip to The Maury show and a DNA test may prove otherwise. </p>
<p>Remember the TV show, The Courtship of Eddies Father?  They could make a TV movie about this&hellip;The Court and prosecution of De Andre and his alleged Father. </p>
<p>Five bucks says the victim was white.  Ferndale is 95% white&hellip;which is why they went there hunt. <br>
 <br>
Nice parenting. </p>

		<p>This story just shows that the war against crime is a failure - just like the war against drugs. The solution, really the only solution is to end all of these laws that try to control market place transactions. Free market solutions will solve the situation as communities will have to compete to make themselves more attractive to business and commerce. Those areas that have less of this type of commerce, will attract more business.</p>
<p>So remember  - we do not have any racial or crime problems in America - just too much government regulation and not enough free market economics&hellip;</p>

		<p>Beinville? Beinville? Do you pronounce that Bean Ville?<br>
With names like that what other choice do they have other than a life of crime?<br>
Was the victim white? No RACIAL MOTIVATIONS HERE I GUESS?<br>
Someday (if it EVER happens) whites are going to have to wake up and accept the fact that We Are NOT All Equal, and to say we are is insanity at the least.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got to say I&rsquo;m a little miffed. You see I spent $12 with my Dad on Father&rsquo;s day and all the while I could have MADE $12 on Father&rsquo;s day&hellip;.by robbing random people in the park for quarters.</p>
<p>Bravo gentlemen, bravo&hellip;.I just hope everyone on this site remembers that everyone is the same and black criminality is based on societal racism- That will be a test item in an Afrocentric class somewhere in the near future.</p>
