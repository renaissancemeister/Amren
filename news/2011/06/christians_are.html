			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Wynne-Jones, Telegraph (London), June 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Trevor Phillips warned that &#8220;an old time religion incompatible with modern society&#8221; is driving the revival in the Anglican and Catholic Churches and clashing with mainstream views, especially on homosexuality.</p>
<p>He accused Christians, particularly evangelicals, of being more militant than Muslims in complaining about discrimination, arguing that many of the claims are motivated by a desire for greater political influence.</p>
<p>However the chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission expressed concern that people of faith are &#8220;under siege&#8221; from atheists whom he accused of attempting to &#8220;drive religion underground&#8221;.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph ahead of a landmark report on religious discrimination in Britain, he said the Commission wants to protect Christians and Muslims from discrimination, admitting his body had not been seen to stand up for the people discriminated against because of their faith in the past.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging intervention into the debate over the role of religion in modern Britain, Mr Phillips:</p>
<blockquote>* warned it had become &#8220;fashionable&#8221; to attack and mock religion, singling out atheist polemicist Richard Dawkins for his views;
<p>* said faith groups should be free from interference in their own affairs, meaning churches should be allowed to block women and homosexuals from being priests and bishops;</p>
<p>* attacked hardline Christian groups which he said were picking fights  &mdash;  particularly on the issue of homosexuality  &mdash;  for their own political ends;</p>
<p>* told churches and religious institutions they had to comply with equality legislation when they delivered services to the public as a whole.</blockquote></p>
<p>The report, published by the Commission tomorrow, says that some religious groups have been the victims of rising discrimination over the last decade.</p>
<p>It shows that in the course of the last decade, the number of employment tribunal cases on religion or belief brought each year has risen from 70 to 1000  &mdash;  although only a fraction of cases were upheld.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips spoke after a series of high-profile cases which have featured Christians claiming they have been discriminated against because of their beliefs, with a doctor currently fighting a reprimand from the General Medical Council for sharing his faith with a patient.</p>
<p>While the equalities boss promised to fight for the rights of Christians, he expressed concern that many cases were driven by fundamentalist Christians who are holding increasing sway over the mainstream churches because of the influence of African and Caribbean immigrants with &#8220;intolerant&#8221; views.</p>
<p>In contrast, Muslims are less vociferous because they are trying to integrate into British &#8220;liberal democracy&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&rsquo;s an awful lot of noise about the Church being persecuted but there is a more real issue that the conventional churches face that the people who are really driving their revival and success believe in an old time religion which in my view is incompatible with a modern, multi-ethnic, multicultural society,&#8221; Phillips said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muslim communities in this country are doing their damnedest to try to come to terms with their neighbours to try to integrate and they&rsquo;re doing their best to try to develop an idea of Islam that is compatible with living in a modern liberal democracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most likely victim of actual religious discrimination in British society is a Muslim but the person who is most likely to feel slighted because of their religion is an evangelical Christian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senior clergy, including Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, have attacked equality laws for eroding Christianity and stifling free speech, but Phillips said many of the legal cases brought by Christians on issues surrounding homosexuality were motivated by an attempt to gain political influence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for a lot of Christian activists, they want to have a fight and they choose sexual orientation as the ground to fight it on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the whole argument isn&rsquo;t about the rights of Christians. It&rsquo;s about politics. It&rsquo;s about a group of people who really want to have weight and influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;There are a lot of Christian activist voices who appear bent on stressing the kind of persecution that I don&rsquo;t think really exists in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Mr Phillips, who is a Salvationist from a strong Christian background, expressed concern over the rise in Britain of anti-religious voices, such as Richard Dawkins, who are intolerant of people of faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand why a lot of people in faith groups feel a bit under siege,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no question that there is more anti-religion noise in Britain.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a great deal of polemic which is anti-religious, which is quite fashionable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phillips said that the Commission is committed to protecting people of faith against discrimination and also defended the right of religious institutions to be free from Government interference.</p>
<p>The Church of England is under pressure to allow openly gay clergy to be made bishops, while the Catholic Church only permits men to be priests, but the head of the Government-funded equalities watchdog said they are entitled to rule on their own affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law doesn&rsquo;t dictate their organisation internally, in the way they appoint their ministers and bishops for example,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s perfectly fair that you can&rsquo;t be a Roman Catholic priest unless you&rsquo;re a man. It seems right that the reach of anti-discriminatory law should stop at the door of the church or mosque.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not keen on the idea of a church run by the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think the law should run to telling churches how they should conduct their own affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The intervention by the Commission comes after criticism of its £70 million annual budget, which is to be cut drastically.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips, a former Labour chairman of the Greater London Assembly and television producer was criticised for his £110,000 a year salary and was accused of &#8220;pandering to the right&#8221; by Ken Livingstone, the former Labour London mayor, for saying that multiculturalism had failed.</p>

		<p>Lol&hellip;.where are these &#8220;militant&#8221; Christians&hellip;..because I&rsquo;d like to join them.</p>
<p>I love the members of my church&hellip;.holy people who are serious about their worship and love of God and Jesus.  But one thing that I have an extreme problem with is their pacifism.  Or, it might be more accurate to say they do not tolerate what I consider a normal and healthy interest in weapons and techniques of war and a preparation to destroy anyone or anything that threatens those I love.  I consider men who do not embrace, prepare and train in that to be cowards.</p>

I began reading this article prepared to defend Christians against Trevor Phillips. After reading the article I see Trevor Phillips as motivated by a nuanced concern for the sensitivities of people of faith against the forces of militant, crusading atheism. In Europe the worst bigots are the atheists. </p>

<p>In the Daily Mail version, the headline said Trevor Phillips says that &#8220;some Christians&#8221; are more &#8220;militant&#8221; than Muslims.  He says it himself right here way   &mdash;   By &#8220;some Christians,&#8221; he means black Christians.  That said, their &#8220;militancy&#8221; isn&rsquo;t based on Christianity, or even religion per se.  It&rsquo;s not even political militancy.  It&rsquo;s just criminal blacks being criminal blacks.</p>

Just the other day I was wondering what happened to Mr. Phillips. He&rsquo;s usually in the British press complaining about how white England is.</p>
<p>Now I know.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been busy working on another theory to explain why whites are evil.<br>

<p>When Trevor Phillips meets with &#8216;Muslim community leaders&rsquo; he is no doubt hearing exactly that.  The reality to them is that &#8216;coming to terms&rsquo; means that Muslims will set their own rules.</p>

They are just doing what those militant Christians in Sudan and Nigeria are doing&hellip;which would be getting MURDERED by muslims as usual.

<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely speechless on this guy&rsquo;s &#8216;findings&rsquo;. Go to a thread on the Daily Telegraph/Andrew Gillgan  blogs (award winning investigative reporter) who has been exposing &#8216;Muslim integration&rsquo; first hand for a number of years now. Or Google: &#8220;Britain&rsquo;s First Islamic Republic&#8221;.  Tower Hamlets. </p>
<p>Philips: &ldquo;The most likely victim of actual religious discrimination in British society is a Muslim but the person who is most likely to feel slighted because of their religion is an evangelical Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lol, have a look at how many cases Muslims win for &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;,&rsquo;hurt feelings&rsquo;; even when their behaviour has been blatantly criminal they have gotten away with it, including murder. Ali Dizaei - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Operation HELIOS‎: The investigations, codenamed Operation Helios, cost £4 million and involved over 50 officers. It was the most expensive &hellip;wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Dizaei - </p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
 Philips: Senior clergy, including Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, have attacked equality laws for eroding Christianity and stifling free speech, but Phillips said many of the legal cases brought by Christians on issues surrounding homosexuality were motivated by an attempt to gain political influence.</p>
<p><br>
Not like the Muslims, eh? In actual fact far more cases have been instigated and brought by homosexual groups against Chrisitans for the very same reasons. </p>
<p><br>
Philips: I think for a lot of Christian activists, they want to have a fight and they choose sexual orientation as the ground to fight it on,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Again, Stonewall are far more millitant against Christians than the other way round. <br>
 <br>
Philips: &ldquo;I think the whole argument isn&rsquo;t about the rights of Christians. It&rsquo;s about politics. It&rsquo;s about a group of people who really want to have weight and influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Surely it&rsquo;s the same for all factions, be they racial, religious, cultural. That&rsquo;s human nature.I mean Trevor Philips never ever did anything like this of course. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s funnier- what he&rsquo;s saying, or that he might actually believe it&rsquo;s true. Either way, it&rsquo;s all good - more and more these anti-white racists are showing ordinary decent non-racist white citizens that they are being discriminated against by their own government, aided by a cowed media. Non-native, non integrating minorities are being pandered to while they vigorously undermine our traditional way of life. The internet is a big white wall, and thanks to ridiculous spouting from delusional idiots like this one, the writing on it is becoming ever more apparent. Islam is the antithesis of human cultural achievement.</p>

		<p>@Jonathan Engel, before you start bashing atheists as &#8220;bigots,&#8221; you might want to consider how much violence the atheists are perpetrating in the name of their cause.  Oh, right, NONE WHATSOEVER. Instead, you should make common cause with the atheists, because they generally share the same culture and the same values that you do, while the Muslim immigrants do not. It&rsquo;s not the atheists who are responsible for all the rapes in Sweden, who are chopping women&rsquo;s clits off, who are rioting in the streets at the merest whiff of &#8220;disrespect,&#8221; and so on. Get your priorities straight, Mr. Engel, we&rsquo;re on your side.</p>

<p>Interesting conclusion.  But white racial survival depends upon whites asserting themselves in the most &#8220;bigoted&#8221; ways.  Calling atheists bigots is the same strategy as calling whites racists for resisting anti-white oppression.  Atheism is a philosophical response to age old religious dogmatic, controlling, oppression.  Atheists are such a small group, yet they really rankle believers because they use logic, history, and common sense in forming their rational responses to irrational thoughts, claims, and practices - all in the interest of creating a healthier society.  Impatient representatives like Richard Dawkins leave his critics breathlessly angry because he is so inescapable.</p>
<p>We have seen many examples of how Christian thought undermines the necessary &#8220;bigotry&#8221; required for white survival.  Our exclusiveness must be asserted, first, to ourselves.  Removing the stumbling blocks of contradictory psychology is something on philosophical atheists can do for us.  The current atheist spokesman are great performance artists whose razor sharp wits frustrate and anger Christians and believers.  But check their IQs, they are at the top of their racial profile.  They and scientists, who are most often agnostics and atheists, represent the actual acme of white (and human) intellectual achievement.</p>
<p>Remember Dr. Watson&rsquo;s genetic work and recent conclusions that got him fired?  These people ought to be and actually are our allies and best examples of white intellectual prowess.  It is hypocritical to condemn them while using them in arguments concerning white achievement.  </p>
<p>In the end (or sometime before that) we must decide, is superstition and emotionalism - a trait common in the primitive world, more important than the almost exclusive white ability to explore, achieve, and create a higher life?  Because when whites rage over their belief systems, they are no different from Muslims or anyone else who cannot respond to cold logic except by condemning and destroying what upsets them.</p>

<p>This is the problem; Phillips is dodging white race replacement concerns of people who happen to be white and traditionally Christian.  England, Britain are traditionally Christian nations.  The monarchy will have to be eliminated for Phillips to realize his ultimate goals.  This is something that even atheists hopefully realize would cause mortal damage to the existence of the UK and England as an identifiable entity.  What Phillips is angling for is an interpretation of Britishness and England as an opened Marxist state, available to anyone for use and settlement.  But what he really wants is more blacks and Muslims to have access to Englands land and wealth - and power.  It is plain usurpation.  Atheists like Dawkins must not be blind to race suicide as they attempt to eliminate the retarding psychosis&rsquo; of superstition and dogmatic control of the mind and spirit that all these old religions share.</p>

<p>Philosophical atheists have never, and never would form into military auxiliaries to invade, torment, or otherwise war on humanity to get it&rsquo;s ideas or agenda&rsquo;s across.  Atheism is an attempt to free the intellect of superstition and dogmatic thinking in order to allow it to evolve higher consciousness and achievements.  Whites have been the historical vanguard, in science and advances in civilization because of that.  All religious thought tends to take us backward because they rely on the mentality of the &#8220;true believer&#8221; who must accept impossible propositions as fact and nonsensical rituals as most meaningful.  Their own sub-conscious rejection of that nonsense requires frequent, chanted repetition of that dogma and the vilification of any who do not share that dogma, to the point of violence, as history and the present so well illustrates.</p>
