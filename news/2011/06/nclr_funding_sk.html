<h1>NCLR Funding Skyrockets After Obama Hires Its VP</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judicial Watch, June 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The influential and politically-connected National Council of La Raza (NCLR) has long benefitted from Uncle Sam&rsquo;s largess but the group has made a killing since Obama hired its senior vice president (Cecilia Muñoz) in 2009 to be his director of intergovernmental affairs.</p>
<p>Ignored by the mainstream media, Judicial Watch covered the appointment because the president issued a special &#8220;ethics waiver&#8221; to bring Muñoz aboard since it violated his own lobbyist ban. At the pro illegal immigration NCLR, Muñoz supervised all legislative and advocacy activities on the state and local levels and she was heavily involved in the congressional immigration battles that took place in the George W. Bush Administration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week a JW probe has uncovered details of the alarming increase in federal funding that these NCLR groups have received since Muñoz joined the Obama Administration. In fact, the government cash more than doubled the year Muñoz joined the White House, from $4.1 million to $11 million.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, a big chunk of the money (60%) came from the Department of Labor, which is headed by a former California congresswoman (Hilda Solis) with close ties to the La Raza movement. Since Obama named her Labor Secretary, Solis has launched a nationwide campaign to protect illegal immigrant workers in the U.S. {snip}</p>
<p>The NCLR also received additional taxpayer dollars from other federal agencies in 2010, the JW probe found. The Department of Housing and Urban Development doled out $2.5 million for housing counseling, the Department of Education contributed nearly $800,000 and the Centers for Disease Control a quarter of a million.</p>
<p>Additionally, NCLR affiliates nationwide raked in tens of millions of government grant and recovery dollars last year thanks to the Muñoz factor. An offshoot called Chicanos Por La Causa (CPLC) saw its federal funding nearly double to $18.3 million following Muñoz&rsquo; appointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chicanos Por La Causa&#8221;??  Hell, these people need to go back and do a review of elementary Spanish grammar and bone up on POR vs. PARA as prepositions.  Just another bunch of naco rabble as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>

		<p>this is happening due to the Ford/Rockefeller foundations.  And to the corporations/businesses who want the cheap labor.  The survival of this country is not of their concern.  Taxpayers are to used for their benefit.</p>

		<p>Clearly the sacred N word thinks this will lock in the ILLEGAL ALIEN vote, and of course it may do so. </p>

		<p>Not surprising. Hispanics have become the chosen race and even though La Raza is one of the most anti-American organizations in the country, it is pandered to by this administration. </p>

		<p>If NCLR can get tens of millions of our tax dollars, why can&rsquo;t the New Century Foundation get a similar amount?  After all, at least the NCF doesn&rsquo;t advocate that people break our immigration laws.</p>

<p>White nationalists in particular need to understand that the US is no longer under the rule of law.  Our elites freely ignore even their own meager rules on a whim.  They sign little pieces of paper (in Obama&rsquo;s case he doesn&rsquo;t even do that&hellip;.he has a machine do it for him) and then do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, do you have a moral obligation to obey the law, follow rules, policies and procedures, cooperate in any way?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  Acting blatantly when agents of force around will get you punished.  But anything and everything you can get away with to destroy those harming us, is not only moral, it&rsquo;s a moral imperative.</p>
<p>Tax evasion, making money by stealing it from the government or any corporation you can, using extreme methods to protect your family, refusing to render aid to non-whites, undermining these people at every opportunity&hellip;.it&rsquo;s all fair game.</p>

		<p>The really bad part of all of this is not the money, but the Republican response, nothing. The Republicans don&rsquo;t want to make this a campaign issue for fear of loosing the Hispanic vote. </p>
<p>My guess is, if the Republicans do get elected in 2012, they will spend even more money on Hispanic in an attempt to buy their votes in 2014 and 2016.</p>

<p><br>
It seems to me the entire Obama Administration is just one huge &#8220;ethics waiver.&#8221; The Anointed One can waive ethics, waive tradition, waive the Constitution itself. These are not the actions of a US President, but of a dictator, of totalitarianism. </p>
<p>As an earlier poster said, we are getting well beyond the Rule of Law here. </p>

		<p>White people need to start shunning Hispanics, even the &#8220;whiter&#8221; ones because they are politicially aligned with the blacks against our interests.  If they want to vote with the blacks, they can live with the blacks.  </p>
