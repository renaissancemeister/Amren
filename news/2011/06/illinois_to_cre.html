<h1>Illinois to Create Private Scholarship Fund for Children of Undocumented Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, May 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn is expected to sign a bill that would create a private college scholarship fund for the children of undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Illinois is on the verge of becoming the first state to create a private college scholarship fund for the children of undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The Illinois House, which on Thursday passed a state version of the DREAM Act by a 61-53 vote, sent a bill to Gov. Pat Quinn that would set up a state fund that would route privately funded college scholarships to as many as 95,000 children of undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The children would be able to obtain private college scholarships and enroll in state savings programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters praised the legislation as a much-needed way to offer financial help to undocumented immigrants who graduate from Illinois high schools and want to continue their studies in college but can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>The Illinois Dream Act would create a panel to raise private money for college scholarships and let the children of immigrants join programs that help them invest money and save for college.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To qualify for the college savings pool, students must have a Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Scholarship recipients must have at least one immigrant parent and the student must have attended school in Illinois for at least three years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents have criticized the legislation as improper because it provides benefits that could help people who violate immigration laws. They also have complained it&rsquo;s confusing because of proposed federal legislation by the same name that would give some illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.</p>

		<p>The is no reason nor need for the State of Illinois to get involved in PRIVATE scolarships.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with the DREAM Act of Illinois as it is written, I disagree with it because it is being set up by the state and at some point in the very near future TAX DOLLARS WILL BE USED TO FUND IT.</p>

		<p>Very wise decision to canvas for private funds since there are no state funds left.</p>

		<p>From the original article : <i>&#8220;These students deserve an opportunity. They work hard. We send them through grade school, we send them through high school, then we slam a door in their face and say `Oh well, all the hard work is for nothing. You can&rsquo;t go to college,&#8221;&rsquo; said state Rep. Edward Acevedo, D-Chicago.</i></p>
<p>Oh, how I wish that were true! But it&rsquo;s not. Illegals aren&rsquo;t prevented from going to college. What this bill does is provide scholarships to people in the country ILLEGALLY that citizens can&rsquo;t even get. Discriminating against citizens in favor of illegals is insanity. That&rsquo;s how far down the rabbit hole things have gotten.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t Illinois one of the most indebted states, and likely to have problems funding services to meet bond obligations?  Nice that they spend money administering to illegals.  </p>

		<p>Remind me again, what is the advantage to being a legal resident?  You have to pay taxes, you have to pay tuition, you have to pay for medical care.  It appears much of this is optional if you are an illegal.  What, claim you are an illegal, they aren&rsquo;t allowed to check on that, then glom onto the benefits!</p>

		<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but isn&rsquo;t Illinois on the verge of bankruptcy like California, and for the same reasons? If so, then where are they getting the money for this?</p>

		<p>To #3 and BAW - </p>
<p>Yes, this is further proof why my state was considered &#8220;nearing financial disaster&#8221;. I can give you an endless list of reasons why it is. </p>
<p>And this Private scholarship Fund&hellip;which to me sounds more like a privatly funded (whites taxes) place that secretly gives scholarships (free passes to some jobs that whitey are more legitimate, eligible and considered for) to minorities. The smart people (us are some of them) know why it&rsquo;s REALLY becoming broke.</p>
<p>And as embarrassed as I am to how our state is run, yes it is going to be a financial disaster in a short period of time. I promise you Illinois will soon turn from &#8220;The land of Lincoln&#8221; to &#8220;The land of welfare and illegal immigration under the shoplifted pockets of hard working whites by corrupt and cowardly politicans&#8221;.<br>
In some ways i&rsquo;m hoping illinois goes broke so there&rsquo;s no money left to fund illegals and non-working minorities into these Acts. Show them what being an american, and a citizen of illinois is really all about. </p>
<p>The &#8220;american dream&#8221; is soon becoming &#8220;The American dream Act&#8221;.</p>

		<p>In the question lies the answer.  Or at least the motive.</p>
<p>If you are using State authority to gift funds to those not part of the system which gives you that authority, then you are flouting _the system itself_.  And the participation in it by the honorable, truting, white, base population.</p>
<p>Why would you want to engender such digust and revulsion amongst your tax paying population base (i.e. the ones who pay the State government salaries because they are honest white workers) except that you wish to open the population&rsquo;s minds to the concept of replacing such corrupt malfeasance on the part of their own government with something &#8216;more responsible&rsquo;, from outside?</p>
<p>This is why I say we need to _rapidly_ move towards a white nation state of our own.  Within the borders of the old United States so that we can chuck out all population groups whom we don&rsquo;t like without being told we are &#8216;removing them from their American civil rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Because the kind of psyops that is being practiced here is one which can only be aimed at dividing America up so that OWG globalism is seen as a &#8216;good idea&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But if it was such a good idea, then they would not have to corrupt the existing system to make it seem so.</p>
<p>White America will never stay white if we don&rsquo;t vote for and from amongst, our own.  Only by electing those who hold a common racial identity from amongst our own can we dare to expect them to hold to a fiduciary level of white responsibility for our common good.  And that is exactly the opposite of what is being done here.</p>
<p>&#8216;Might as well call it the NAU, because there is certainly more of Mexico in Illinois than there are whites&hellip;&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I never want to hear that kind of shaped logic argument expressed in my nation.  But that is clearly what we&rsquo;re being mind-game directed towards concluding.</p>

		<p>Just taking the first impression from reading this, so I haven&rsquo;t seen all the details of the proposal, but it sounds exactly like the way I would want these &#8220;Dream Act&#8221; proposals to work- privately funded. If liberals want to hand out entitlements to others, feel free, as long as it comes from their own pocket and not the public largesse. Privately funded scholarships do that. That being said, I do have issue with illegal aliens and their children being here in the first place, and if government were properly enforcing the borders and laws in regards to immigration, the issue about whether the children of illegals are to receive any forms of scholarships to US institutions would be a moot issue.</p>
