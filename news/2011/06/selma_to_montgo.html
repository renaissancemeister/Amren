<h1><a href="/ar/1995/05/index.html#cover">Selma to Montgomery, 30 Years Later</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marian Evans, American Renaissance, May 1995</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>
					<span class="dropcap">M</span>arch 1995 marked the 30th anniversary
 of the Selma-to-Montgomery voting-rights march. The surviving leaders 
of the demonstration recently met to commemorate what was one of the 
most effective efforts of the civil rights era. The atmosphere was one 
of amity and self-congratulation, in which it was taken for granted that
 the marchers and their purposes were noble and their opponents were 
despicable racists. In an act of contrition, Joe Smitherman, who was 
mayor of Selma 30 years ago, presented the keys to the city to a group 
of aging civil rights leaders. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Rituals like this firmly establish the today&rsquo;s view of who was 
right and who was wrong. And yet, does Mr. Smitherman, who saw the 
now-sanctified event as it really unfolded, not harbor even fleeting 
reservations about the new America that the civil rights movement 
created? Perhaps not. George Wallace, former governor of Alabama, 
recently gave a framed photograph of himself to Rosa Parks, who started 
the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955. He inscribed it &#8220;To a great lady.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					The 1965 demonstrations in Selma and Montgomery were part of a 
massive campaign to secure voting rights for blacks. In the states of 
the former Confederacy, it had been only during Reconstruction that 
blacks had had more or less uncontested voting rights. In Alabama, 
blacks were first given the vote under a state constitution written in 
1867 by Northerners and forced upon the state by the U.S. Congress.

				<p>
					A new constitution, written in 1901, eliminated most blacks from 
politics, by limiting suffrage to people who could read and understand 
the U.S. Constitution, and who had been employed during the previous 
year or who had paid property taxes. The new constitution also required 
separate schools for black and white children. Since that time, as in 
most of the South, the vigor with which suffrage restrictions were 
applied to blacks varied from region to region.

				<p>
					In 1965, black civil rights leaders seemed to be winning every 
battle they fought. The Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in 
1954, and the &#8220;sit-in&#8221; movement, begun in 1960, successfully integrated 
many Southern lunch counters, restaurants, hotels and churches. 
President Eisenhower used federal troops forcibly to integrate public 
schools in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in 1962 President Johnson used 
them to overwhelm resistance to integration at the University of 
Mississippi. The movement&rsquo;s greatest success, however, had been the 
passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination
 in employment and public accommodation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The national press was warmly sympathetic to black demonstrators 
and their white supporters. The movement basked in an aura of great 
moral superiority, and the obvious next step for what seemed to be an 
unstoppable juggernaut was to secure unrestricted voting rights for 
Southern blacks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Martin Luther King, who led this stage of the movement, was by then
 world famous. Having come to prominence only ten years earlier during 
the Montgomery bus boycott, he was now a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize
 and a frequent guest at the White House. He chose Dallas County, 
Alabama as the target for demonstrations because it had been 
particularly inhospitable to black voters. Although there were more 
blacks than whites of voting age in the county, 28 white voters were 
registered for every black. Selma, 50 miles from Montgomery, was the 
county seat. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A Board of Registrars examined prospective voters, black and white.
 It had a small office in the Selma courthouse and could handle no more 
than 50 applicants a day. On January 18th, 1965, King and his close 
assistant, Ralph Abernathy, led six or seven hundred people to the 
courthouse and demanded that they be registered. There was already a 
line of ordinary applicants, and the group was turned away. The 
demonstrators marched back to their headquarters at Brown&rsquo;s Chapel 
Church, and held a press conference, claiming   &mdash;   correctly   &mdash;   that blacks 
had been denied registration. Overlooked were the facts that blacks had 
been among those waiting to be tested and that in the days before the 
demonstration a number of blacks had been duly registered. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar nationally-reported exercises took place throughout the 
months of January and February. King was constantly in and out of town, 
flying around the country raising money and giving press conferences. He
 returned to give speeches and lead marches. Meanwhile, more and more 
northern whites trickled into town. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At the time, Selma had a population of 29,000 people, of whom 
15,000 were black. It took only a small crowd to paralyze the town, and 
at the height of the demonstrations approximately 11,000 outsiders were 
swarming the streets. Selma&rsquo;s mayor, Joe Smitherman, complained that for
 three months he spent three quarters of his time dealing with 
out-of-town demonstrators. Selma police were swamped with complaints of 
thievery, and townspeople were soon heartily sick of the visitors, many 
of whom were drunk and left garbage wherever they went. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Some Northerners came just to have a good time. Many were 
&#8220;beatniks,&#8221; who drifted across the country from one demonstration to 
another. They had no money for hotels which were, in any case, 
commandeered by the hundreds of journalists covering the demonstrations.
 Many whites of both sexes found accommodation in black churches and in 
the George Washington Carver Homes, the black housing project. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Intimate mixing of the races in this fashion was unheard of in the 
rural South, but even more shocking to the people of Selma was the 
public sexual behavior of the demonstrators. If the accounts of what can
 only be described as public debauchery were not given in sworn 
affidavits by citizens, state troopers, and national guardsmen, they 
would be difficult to believe (see following story). Residents of Selma 
could be forgiven for beginning to wonder whether the demonstrations 
were as much about public interracial copulation as they were about 
voting rights. Many of the journalists were disgusted by what they saw, 
and complained that candid accounts of the demonstrators&rsquo; behavior were 
edited out of the stories they filed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Language as well as behavior was edited. On one occasion, James 
Forman, secretary of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee 
(SNCC), spoke at the Beulah Baptist Church in Montgomery. Addressing a 
mixed-race group that included many ministers, nuns, and church women, 
he said: &#8220;If the Negro isn&rsquo;t given his place at the table of democracy  &hellip;
 it&rsquo;s time for us to knock the f***ing legs off the table.&#8221; Some of the 
ministers expressed surprise at this language, but Forman offered no 
apology. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A few minutes later, Ralph Abernathy tried to smooth things over by
 saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sure that God will forgive him, that the television crews 
will delete it from their films, and newspapermen will not print it.&#8221; A 
beatnik came to Forman&rsquo;s defense: &#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with &#8216;f**k&rsquo;,&#8221; he asked; 
&#8220;It&rsquo;s a good old American word, and expressive.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					There were demonstrations in Montgomery during this period as well.
 On March 10, at about 8:00 p.m., approximately 100 people were being 
harangued on a well-lit street a short distance from the state capitol. 
One of the black leaders of the group then said in a loud voice, 
&#8220;Everyone stand and relieve yourselves.&#8221; Practically the entire crowd, 
male and female, young and old, black and white, did as they were told, 
as rivulets ran almost to the next block. Two blacks were arrested for, 
according to a bystander, &#8220;particularly lewd and offensive exposure of 
their private parts.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					Adding to public revulsion for the demonstrators was the sight of 
men and women in religious garb drunk in public and fondling each other.
 The civil rights movement had always draped itself in religion, and 
King made a point of giving ministers and priests very visible roles. 
The presence of clerics was so useful that some of the demonstrators 
dressed as priests or nuns appear to have been impostors. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This may have been the case during a small demonstration in 
Montgomery on March 16th. A group of 34 men, most dressed as priests, 
arrived at the capitol late in the evening and insisted on praying on 
the capitol steps. Finally, at 3:00 a.m. the police let them say the 
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer on the bottom step. As they broke up to leave, two 
photographers came running across the street. One of the men dressed as a
 priest said to one, &#8220;You stupid son-of-a-bitch, after all this time 
here, you didn&rsquo;t get a picture of us saying a prayer on the bottom 
step.&#8221; An Alabama state policeman said that many of the &#8220;priests&#8221; swore 
like sailors and that he doubted more than half were authentic. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It may have been the disgraceful behavior of false clerics that 
prompted one of the three killings associated with the Selma 
demonstrations. On March 8th, a white Unitarian minister from Boston, 
James Reeb, was brutally clubbed to the ground as he left a restaurant, 
and died two days later. The night before Reeb died, the demonstration 
leaders held an all-night, out-door vigil to pray for his recovery. 
Disgusted journalists noted that a number of young couples at the rear 
of the crowd fornicated during the services. 
				</p>

				<p>
					About this time, Jimmie Lee Jackson, a black civil rights leader, 
was shot and wounded in an altercation with police. Activists swept him 
away, medical treatment was delayed, and the man died. The Chief Deputy 
Sheriff of Dallas County thought the delay was deliberate. &#8220;I believe 
they wanted him to die,&#8221; he said; &#8220;They wanted to make a martyr out of 
him  &hellip;&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					The day after Rev. Reeb was clubbed, Selma demonstrators defied a 
court order and set out to march the 50 miles to Montgomery. As they 
crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge leading out of town, they were met by a
 line of state troopers standing shoulder to shoulder. &#8220;This march will 
not continue  &hellip;&#8221; boomed the public address 
system, but there was deadlock for 15 to 20 minutes, while King and his 
associates knelt to pray, and police pleaded with the demonstrators to 
go home. When officers finally moved forward with night sticks held 
horizontally and tried to push the demonstrators back, the resulting 
mayhem ended in clouds of tear gas. Eighteen officers were injured by 
flying rocks and bottles. 
				</p>
				<p>
					According to press accounts, the police had &#8220;whipped and clubbed&#8221; 
unoffending demonstrators, and television pictures showed crowds of 
fleeing blacks choking on tear gas. Reeb died the day after the 
confrontation at the bridge. These two events were a tremendous 
propaganda advantage for King, and they brought thousands more 
demonstrators to Selma from the North. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A few days later, President Lyndon Johnson went before Congress and
 evoked Reeb&rsquo;s name in a strong call for legislation to ensure voting 
rights for blacks. He also ordered mobilization of the Alabama national 
guard to protect a second attempt at a Selma-to-Montgomery march, this 
one newly sanctioned by a federal judge. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus began, on March 21, 1965, the now-famous march. King, 
Abernathy, and U.N. Undersecretary Ralph Bunche   &mdash;   also a Nobel Peace 
Prize winner   &mdash;   took the lead down Selma&rsquo;s Sylvan Street. On the way to 
the Pettus Bridge, the crowd marched past a record store, where an 
outside speaker alternately blared &#8220;Dixie&#8221; and &#8220;Bye, Bye, Blackbird.&#8221; At
 the head of the procession a mixed group of young men carried the U.S. 
flag upside down   &mdash;   the sign of distress. Many demonstrators wore &#8220;GROW&#8221; 
buttons, which stood for &#8220;Get rid of Wallace.&#8221; Nearly two thousand 
Alabama National Guardsmen, 100 FBI agents, 75 federal marshals, and 
dozens of state and county police officers guarded the marchers. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Just outside Selma, the Citizens Council of America, an 
anti-integration group, had set up posters showing King sitting next to 
known Communist leaders at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. The 
caption read, &#8220;Martin Luther King at Communist Training School.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					History books call this a &#8220;massive&#8221; demonstration and, indeed, some
 11,000 people set off on the first leg of the journey. However, the 
highway to Montgomery narrowed to two lanes shortly after leaving Selma,
 and permission was granted for only 300 marchers on all but a few miles
 of roadway. Most of the crowd therefore streamed back to Selma. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Although it is impossible to know even their approximate numbers, 
some of the demonstrators were shills. A few openly boasted that they 
were in Selma because they had been offered food, money, and sex. Dora 
Brown&rsquo;s unusual financial arrangements came to light when the checks 
stopped coming. In a sworn affidavit she testified as follows: 
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						&#8220;I was at Brown&rsquo;s Chapel Church with the movement along with a 
blind man and a one-legged man who were both white people. I am 
one-armed and we were told at the time that we were the ones they needed
 worst, since we were handicapped it would help the movement. We were 
told that if we would make the march from Selma to Montgomery we would 
be paid $100.00 per month plus food and clothes  &hellip; James Gildersleeve would pay us.&#8221; 
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8220;I have received three checks from Gildersleeve for $100.00 each but now he has quit paying me.&#8221; 
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<table class="quoteright">
					<tbody><tr>
						<th>
							According to press accounts, the police had &#8220;whipped and clubbed&#8221; unoffending demonstrators.
						</th>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
				<p>
					Gildersleeve was not to blame. Rev. Frederick Reese, president of 
the Dallas County Voters League, was arrested after other blacks accused
 him of stealing thousands of dollars in movement funds. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Miss Brown&rsquo;s unhappy testimony continues: &#8220;Gildersleeve told me 
that he couldn&rsquo;t pay me since Frederick Reese had gotten all the money. 
Gildersleeve gave me one pound of lard, some greens, a watermelon and 
$1.00 in money. He said that is all he could give.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is not recorded whether Miss Brown or the one-legged white man 
were among the select 300 who spent four nights on the road to 
Montgomery. It is known that the evenings were characterized by the 
now-usual drunkenness and fornication. On at least one occasion, police 
officers prevented newspapermen from photographing the revelry. And even
 among this inner circle, there were frequent complaints about stolen 
clothes and missing bed rolls. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of the marchers slept in the open except for King, who set up 
housekeeping in a trailer that was moved from camp to camp. There are no
 reports on how he spent his evenings, but his inclinations are now well
 known. His companion, Ralph Abernathy, was not a model cleric, either. 
In 1958, a Mr. Davis was arrested for threatening Abernathy with a 
hatchet because Abernathy kept trying to have sex with Mrs. Davis. She 
testified in her husband&rsquo;s defense that Abernathy had first seduced her 
when she was a 15-year-old member of his congregation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As the march went on, the press continued its adulatory, front-page
 coverage. All around the country, supporters held sympathy marches and 
worship services. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The night before the last leg of the trek, more than 30,000 people 
gathered in a field a few miles outside of Montgomery for a free 
concert. Harry Belafonte, Nina Simone, Sammy Davis, Jr., Billy Eckstein,
 Mahalia Jackson, the Chad Mitchell Trio, and Frankie Laine serenaded 
the crowd until nearly one in the morning. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On March 25, the 30,000 were joined by another 5,000 as King and 
Abernathy led the march into Montgomery, up to the steps of the state 
capitol. The city was festooned with Confederate flags, one of which 
fluttered along with the state flag over the capitol building. It was 
widely   &mdash;   and falsely   &mdash;   reported that not a single United States flag 
flew in Montgomery that day. The Stars and Stripes waved, as it always 
did, from a tall flag pole on the capitol grounds. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The leaders of the march asked to see Governor George Wallace, so 
they could present him with a list of grievances. He refused to meet 
them. The rest of the day was filled with speeches by Hosea Williams, 
Roy Wilkins, James Forman, Ralph Bunche and other black leaders. Joan 
Baez and Peter Paul and Mary were among those who entertained the crowd,
 which finally broke up around four p.m. The march was over. It took 
until midnight for sanitation crews to clean up the mountains of trash 
demonstrators had left behind. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Late that evening, a third killing took place when a white civil 
rights worker name Viola Liuzzo was shot to death as she was driving 
between Selma and Montgomery. Both the press and President Johnson were 
outraged, although accounts of the killing were often incomplete (see 
story, page 7).

				<p>
					Given the sanitized view of the demonstrations that had been 
broadcast to the world, Alabama congressman William L. Dickinson 
undoubtedly met much skepticism on March 30 when he tried to convey a 
different picture to his colleagues on the floor of Congress: 
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						&#8220;Drunkenness and sex orgies were the order of the day in Selma, on
 the road to Montgomery. There were many   &mdash;   not just a few   &mdash;   instances of
 sexual intercourse in public between Negro and white. News reporters 
saw this   &mdash;   law enforcement officials saw this  &hellip; 
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8220;Has anyone stopped to ask what sort of people can leave home, 
family and job   &mdash;   if they have one   &mdash;   and live indefinitely in a foreign 
place demonstrating? This is no religious group of sympathizers trying 
to help the Negro out of a sense of right and morality   &mdash;   this is a bunch
 of godless riffraff out for kicks and self-gratification that have left
 every campsite between Selma and Montgomery littered with whiskey 
bottles, beer cans, and used contraceptives.&#8221; 
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The nation was profoundly uninterested. In fact, the 
Selma-to-Montgomery march was probably one of the most effective events 
in the entire civil rights movement. Unlike the &#8220;March on Washington&#8221; in
 1963, in which 200,000 people took part and where King gave his &#8220;I Have
 a Dream&#8221; speech, the agitation in Selma and Montgomery led directly to 
national legislation. The nation was riveted to the march, and President
 Johnson constantly referred to it in his push for a voting rights bill.
 The killings of James Reeb and Viola Liuzzo were also a great stimulus 
to lawmakers. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The legislation passed and was signed into law in August, 1965. In 
what would appear to be a direct abrogation of the reserved powers 
specified in the Tenth Amendment, it prohibited all state tests of voter
 literacy and education. It even authorized federal elections examiners 
to register voters who had been rejected by state authorities, and to 
patrol the polls to see that such people voted. The law affected states 
outside the South, notably New York, which had required that voters be 
literate in English. New York promptly sued on Tenth Amendment grounds, 
but the Supreme Court ruled in 1966 against the literacy provisions   &mdash;   to
 great rejoicing among the state&rsquo;s Puerto Ricans. 
				</p>
				<p>
					With a total of three deaths, the march was one of the most 
sanguinary episodes in the civil rights period. However, very few 
demonstrators were harrassed or assaulted. In retrospect, it is 
surprising that there was not more violence. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As invariably happens in racial matters, a group of whites with 
little experience of blacks saw fit to give instruction on race 
relations to people with a great deal of experience. Northerners invaded
 the South, a deeply conservative society, demanding that Southerners 
change their way of life. To add insult to arrogance, Northerners then 
proceeded publicly to violate some of the most deeply felt norms of 
privacy and decency. The self-control   &mdash;   even passivity   &mdash;   of the citizens
 of Selma and Montgomery is as astonishing as the degeneracy of the 
demonstrators. Perhaps even Mayor Smitherman, desperately trying to run a
 city overrun with disorderly demonstrators, harbored thoughts of 
homicide. 
				</p>
					Now, 30 years later, Selma is a sacred name, one of the stations of
 the cross on the road to integration and racial equality.

				<p>
					<b>V.B. Bates, Deputy Sheriff of Dallas County:</b> &#8220;To begin with,
 I saw white females in from other counties, other states I believe, 
building up their sexual desires with Negro males. After a few minutes 
of necking and kissing, the Negro male would lead them off into the 
Negro housing project. I watched this procedure many times.&#8221;

					<b>Black man, name withheld:</b> &#8220;[M]en and women used this room 
[in the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee headquarters] for sex
 freely and openly and without interference. On one occasion I saw James
 Forman, executive director of SNCC, and a red-haired white girl whose 
name is Rachel, on one of the cots together. They engaged in sexual 
intercourse, as well as an abnormal sex act  &hellip; Forman and the girl, Rachel, made no effort to hide their actions.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;During this same period, March 8, 9, and 10, a large number of 
young demonstrators of both races and sexes occupied the Jackson Street 
Baptist Church for approximately forty-eight hours  &hellip;
 On one occasion, I saw a Negro boy and a white girl engaged in sexual 
intercourse on the floor of the church. At this time, the church was 
packed and the couple did nothing to hide their actions. While they were
 engaged in this act of sexual intercourse, other boys and girls stood 
around and watched, laughing and joking.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Corporal H.M. Brown, Alabama State Troopers:</b> &#8220;I observed on 
many occasions the so called men of the cloth, who were white, fondling 
the breasts and buttocks of black female demonstrators. On numerous 
occasions, I saw couples of the opposite sex and color leaving the 
crowd, fondling each other and going into the houses and alleys along 
Sylvan Street. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;Since 1961, I have observed mobs and demonstrations, but the crowd
 of demonstrators in Selma, Alabama, was the lowest scum of the earth. 
This gathering of demonstrators in Selma included the largest crowd of 
sex degenerates that I have ever observed in one place in my life. They 
had no morals or scruples and did not appear to care who saw them during
 their orgies.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Captain Lionel Freeman, Alabama State Troopers:</b> &#8220;One Negro 
who was standing beside a priest and both standing about three feet from
 a line of troopers, made several attempts to provoke a trooper into 
hitting him. The Negro waved three dollar bills in the trooper&rsquo;s face 
and then dropped them, saying &#8216;Why don&rsquo;t you pick them up, I know you 
need it.&rsquo;  &hellip; The Negro then said, &#8216;I&rsquo;ll sleep with a white woman tonight.&rsquo; The priest seemed to think this was real funny.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;[S]everal newspapermen who were allowed to go to the rear of the 
demonstration came back up to the front and told us they observed white 
and Negro couples in the act of sexual relations. They told us that they
 had sent the story and pictures home to their papers. One told me that 
the only thing he recognized about his story when it was printed was his
 name.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Lieutenant J.L. Fuqua, Alabama State Troopers:</b> &#8220;I also saw 
Negro men feel the breasts and butts of white girls, making no attempt 
to hide this, but rather appearing like they wanted everyone to see 
them.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Charles R. McMillan, Selma policeman:</b> &#8220;Both Negroes and 
white demonstrators were bedding down side by side. A young teenage 
Negro boy and girl were engaged in a sexual intercourse [sic] that was 
interrupted by a newsman who attempted to take a picture of the act.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					Selma citizen: &#8220;I, Marion J. Bass, did, on the night of the 23rd of
 March 1965, see at the camp site of the Selma to Montgomery march, a 
young white girl and a colored man having sex relations. They were on 
the ground out in the open and did not try in any way to hide as I 
walked within six or eight feet of them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;There were many colored girls and white boys laying in the same 
sleeping bags. I also saw a white girl about 17 years old and four 
colored boys get into the back of a truck and close the doors &hellip; They were in the truck about 45 minutes and when they opened the door to get out, the girl was dressing.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Lieutenant R.E. Etheridge, Alabama State Troopers:</b> &#8220;The 
action and movement of the two wrapped in the quilt left no doubt 
whatever that they were having sexual intercourse. They were within 30 
feet of the main body of demonstrators, and in plain view of them. They 
remained on the ground for about 20 minutes, got up and went toward 
Brown&rsquo;s Chapel Church.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;On the morning of March 14th, at about 11:00 a.m. I saw a white 
preacher with a Negro girl in the back seat of an automobile. He had her
 breasts out of her blouse and was handling them.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;I observed white ministers on at least three occasions who were in what appeared to be a very intoxicated condition.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>First Lieutenant Samuel Carr, Alabama National Guard:</b> &#8220;I 
hereby further swear and attest that during such time of duty with my 
National Guard unit, I personally saw one case of sexual intercourse 
between a young white boy and Negro girl. I further swear and attest 
that I saw occasions of public urination  &hellip;&#8221;

				<p>
					<b>Cecil Atkinson, resident of Prattville, Alabama:</b> &#8220;Between 
Selma and the first stop, I observed both men and women relieving 
themselves in public, all together and making no attempt to conceal 
themselves at all.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;At one point I observed a young beatnik-type man with his collar 
turned around to resemble a priest. He told me that it was &#8216;the way to 
get along.&rsquo; Another told me that he had been offered $15 a day, three 
meals a day, and all the sex he could handle if he would come down and 
join in the demonstration from up North.&#8221; 
				</p>
					<b>Mrs. Nettie Adams, resident of Montgomery:</b> &#8220;There were white and Negro people all over the Ripley Street side of St. Margaret&rsquo;s Hospital [in Montgomery on March 15]  &hellip;
 They were all kissing and hugging. This one particular couple on St. 
Margaret&rsquo;s lawn was engaged in sexual relations   &mdash;   a white woman (skinny 
blond) and a Negro man. After they were through, she wiggled out from 
beneath him and over to the man lying to the left of them on the lawn 
and started kissing and caressing his face.&#8221;

		<p>A family friend was one of the national guardsmen accompanying the march. Before his death a few years ago, he corroborated much of the behavior described in this article. He also stated that there were actually only about 40 people who made the complete march. Most showed up, had their photo made and left or jumped in a car. King did little if any marching except when news cameras were present. He was constantly shadowed by a Cadillac in which he spent most of his time.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As invariably happens in racial matters, a group of whites with little experience of blacks saw fit to give instruction on race relations to people with a great deal of experience. Northerners invaded the South, a deeply conservative society, demanding that Southerners change their way of life. To add insult to arrogance, Northerners then proceeded publicly to violate some of the most deeply felt norms of privacy and decency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the Whites who act this way are rejects from their own society.  They take their anger out on normal Whites in any way they can (they think they are &#8220;getting even&#8221;)and will do so until us normals put a stop to it.</p>
<p>Unfavorable media coverage cements the power of the degenerate over the respectable.</p>

		<p>This story is true and well documented. The worse part was not mentioned that the once beautiful city of Selma has been completely destroyed by the black leadership.  Confederate monuments have been moved and street signs with the names of Confederate generals have been replaced.  Believe it or not but there are still outside agitators working in Selma today.  I have often wondered who supports them? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered how race relations were between blacks and whites before the passage of civil rights laws.  Modern day media and text books make it seem like white southerners routinely beat blacks, subjected them to cruel and barbaric treatment in many spheres of life, and brutalized them at every turn like they were dogs.  The modern narrative is that blacks were essentially peaceful and docile people who wanted to be left alone, while white southerners were boorish and thuggish racists.  When I read accounts like this, it makes it seem like things weren&rsquo;t quite as bad as liberals make them out to be.  If there are any southern commenters here, maybe you&rsquo;d like to share your views on this.</p>

 <br/>
- Marian Evans, American Renaissance, May 1995</p>
<p>Most white liberals live in safe - that is to say white - neighborhoods, and come in contact with few blacks. Those few are either exceptional, or they occupy subordinate positions without resentment. <br/>
 <br/>
Nevertheless, it must be said that segregationists did a bad job of getting their message out. It was difficult to convince whites with little exposure to blacks that blacks were dangerous when the image of segregationists outside the South was of howling mobs beating up peaceful demonstrators who were singing hymns and folk songs. <br/>
 <br/>
And that did happen. The camera did not lie. It was not until the black ghetto riots began in northern cities that northern whites began to get a more complex view of blacks. The facts that there were no major riots in the South, and that the riots in the North ended as soon as the inauguration of President Nixon changed northern attitudes about blacks, the Democrat Party, and the government. <br/>

		<p>The fact is that the 1960s was a time of sexual decadence. I saw first hand how the hippies, some suburbanites and other &#8220;love children&#8221; behaved shamelessly in San Francisco and other urban areas in in the late 1960s. You had people engaging in group sex,(in some cases, openly!), spouse swapping parties etc&hellip; In some cases you also had people having sex on the street! </p>
<p>It was disgusting! The hoodlums at Selma were not all that distinctive in their sick, deplorable behavior.</p>

		<p>Why would you expect any different? </p>
<p>Slavery was never intended for the west and whites were given their chance to fix the problem in 1791 but failed. This would have stopped the Santa Domingo Island for the white French in 1801 where they were all massacred and set the stage for the white demise worldwide. </p>

		<p>As one who participated in the anti war movement from 1969 to 1974 I am mildly skeptical of this story. <br/>
 <br/>
I participated in larger demonstrations during a time when the dial on the sexual revolution - which I never liked - had moved in the direction of greater license. The closest I ever saw to this kind of thing was one demonstration in Washington, DC when several demonstrators took their clothes off and waded in the Reflection Pool. I never saw public sexual intercourse. I certainly never saw it in a church.<br/>
 <br/>
I agree that if this did happen during the Selma March it was disgraceful. </p>

		<p>Around the time of this event I was a young CPA employed as an auditor. One of my assignments was performing financial operating studies of hospitals around the state of Alabama to gather data for a statewide healthcare facility. I was shocked by the the emergency room cases at rural hospitals along Highway 80 between Selma and Montgomery. Alcohol induced blackouts, drug overdoses and, worst of all, the physical and mental damage to young white females who had apparently had been secretly drugged and gang raped. The physical damages to parts of their bodies would eventually heal but I&rsquo;m not sure if they ever recovered mentally.</p>

		<p>I would have a lot better feeling for our press if some of these &#8216;articles&rsquo; which were submitted and subsequently grossly distorted by national chain newspapers could be gathered together and reprinted, in a collection.</p>
<p>Given the &#8216;great moment in history&rsquo; nature of the events being reported and the utter dichotomy between what was said and actually -seen-, on the ground, I find it exceptionally hard to believe that journalists wouldn&rsquo;t hold back a copy of their submitted work for their own records.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t innocents, not even in 1965.</p>
<p>As the American economy sinks lower and lower beneath the waves and and ethnic behaviors skew more and more towards their racial means, the ability to point to a -starting- point for the prurience, violence and degeneracy of our times could help, a lot, in giving us a view of what times were like -before- the bums rush of the socialist liberals.</p>

<p>You must not know too much. Of course blacks and these so-called &#8220;white&#8221; girls would have sex in the church!  They had it in broad daylight on peoples lawns for pete&rsquo;s sake! Who do you believe, then? The corrupted media or eyewitnesses, such as police officers and residents living around all that stuff?</p>
<p> Many of those &#8220;clerics&#8221; were no more a preacher than I am and wore the &#8220;cloth&#8221; while engaging in sex also. I guess you don&rsquo;t believe that either? You think this stuff doesn&rsquo;t happen TODAY? Give me a break. </p>

		<p>Why would anyone doubt that the liberal press skewed the facts in favor of blacks and white lefties, just like they do today?  Also, the press of that day did not openly discuss distasteful sex, though, for the good of society, they surely should have mentioned the events detailed in this article!<br/>
During the Reconstruction period, when Southern blacks started to vote and serve in legislatures, one of their first proposals was the legalization of interracial marriage.  Common sense would tell someone to let such an explosive proposal wait until later, but that says something about the common sense  &mdash;  or lack of it  &mdash;  involved.</p>

		<p>Frankie Laine? I had to look this up, and he was at the Selma march.<br/>
   For you younger folks, Laine was a white singer who was popular in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s. He is best known for the number of theme songs for Westerns he sang. Then again, the theme song for Rawhide would have been perfect for the Selma march.<br/>

		<p> The American press is not monolithic, and was not in 1965. It is only in retrospect that Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement have become iconic. If the Selma March had been characterized by sexual license and public intoxication and urination I suspect that conservative publications like Human Events, and National Review, both of which opposed the civil rights movement at the time, would have publicized those characteristics. </p>

<p>Seems the 1960s was the decade America started its downward plunge in earnest (it started its decline in 1868 with the &#8220;passage&#8221; of the 14th Amendment).  I was born in 1973, so I obviously got taught some revised history.</p>

Hello Johnny. As a 67 year old White southerner, I can tell you firsthand that for many Blacks life in the south before the 1960s was much rougher. Many Blacks were indeed the victims of unprovoked violence and mistreatment.</p>
<p>However, it seems today that things have went too far the other way.  Many Blacks (and Hispanics for that matter) are out of control! </p>
<p>Another fact is that Hispanics were very small in number thus they were not a major problem just as many Blacks in the era I am talking about were not major nuisance as well.<br/>

<p>At the same time, the better elements of Southern society often went out of their way to show kindness to them. Some would say this was patronizing, but it was benevolence nonetheless.

<p>No comment as to WHY these &#8220;low-class Southerners&#8221; did &#8220;bad&#8221; things to blacks? No comment as to what the BLACKS did to Whites back then, especially to White women and girls? At least those &#8220;low-class&#8221; Whites had a darn good reason and the moral duty to defend their race against the black onslaught.

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I forgot to add this sentence of yours.</p>
<p><br/>
You don&rsquo;t see the irony in all this? And we are STILL giving Blacks our MONEY/jobs/women/etc., aren&rsquo;t we? You can call it benevolent or charity all you want since it was your own mother, but I call it the White man&rsquo;s/woman&rsquo;s folly. Our charity and altruism begins with and ends with our own RACE. We are now seeing the devastating results of all this &#8220;benevolence&#8221; are we not? Now poor Whites are more than likely to be left out of any help or charity, since we have to &#8220;help&#8221; these poor little minority races.</p>

		<p>Having lived around radical leftists before, I find little reason to doubt the contents of this article. Especially since it is clearly stated that alcohol was involved. Probably some of the stories of public sex and lewdness were individual incidents repeated by multiple witnesses, of course, as could hardly be believed that any more than a visible minority of the protestors partook in such behavior. </p>
<p>As for sex in a church, it really isn&rsquo;t as unusual as the pious here would like to think. </p>
<p>As for it not being mentioned in then-conservative journals like the National Review, I would say we have to first look back to confirm that it wasn&rsquo;t. In any case though, describing and commenting on such debauchery may have been considered beneath the dignity of such publications, feeling that they had a strong enough ideological case for arguing against the &#8220;civil rights movement&#8221;.</p>

<p>That was their first MISTAKE!. Sounds like a bunch of liberal do-gooders as we see today, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>As for this comment,<br/>
As a Southerner of roughly your same age, I agree with some of what you said. In the past there was a low-class white Southern element that did bad things to blacks.<br/>
 &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>No comment as to WHY these &ldquo;low-class Southerners&rdquo; did &ldquo;bad&rdquo; things to blacks? No comment as to what the BLACKS did to Whites back then, especially to White women and girls? At least those &ldquo;low-class&rdquo; Whites had a darn good reason and the moral duty to defend their race against the black onslaught. I don&rsquo;t see these &ldquo;uppity&rdquo; White Southerners doing what needed to be done. Nope, they aided and abetted, did they not?</p>
<p>How convenient of you to leave all that out. Or maybe you were &ldquo;educated&rdquo; in our PC schools? </p>

As a fellow pre-baby boomer southerner, like Southron, I can attest to the fact &#8220;anonymus&#8221; post is a bunch of twisted, falsehood illogical NONSENSE! </p>
<p>Southron is correct. </p>
