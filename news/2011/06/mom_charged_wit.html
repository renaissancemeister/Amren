<h1>Mom Charged with Murder of 5-Year-Old Son Beat Child to Death Because He Broke the TV: Prosecutors</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rocco Parascandola and Kevin Deutsch, NY Daily News, June 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Bronx mom said she beat her 5-year-old son to death because he broke the television while playing Nintendo Wii, prosecutors said Monday.</p>
<p>Kim Crawford, 21, smacked Jamar Johnson in his back and stomach on June 13 &#8220;harder than I&rsquo;ve ever hit him,&#8221; she told cops.</p>
<p>Crawford watched him vomit and complain of agonizing pain for five days as his internal injuries got worse. She never took him to the hospital because she feared getting arrested, she told investigators.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was worried they&rsquo;d see the bruises and I&rsquo;d get in trouble,&#8221; she told cops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After hours of questioning, she finally admitted becoming enraged at Jamar when he told her he broke the television, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hit Jamar twice in the back and twice in the stomach,&#8221; she told cops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a separate case, a Bronx man was charged Monday with killing his girlfriend&rsquo;s 3-year-old daughter, police said. Edgar Algarin, 26, apparently exploded in anger because Enidaliz Ortiz-Encarnacion wouldn&rsquo;t eat, sources said. He told police he punched the girl in the back, sources said.</p>
<p>The city Medical Examiner&rsquo;s office said the girl was choked and beaten in the upper torso.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sources said the girl&rsquo;s mother was away on business and that Algarin may have been angry that he was forced to babysit.</p>

		<p>How anyone can injure a child is beyond me. That innate horror I feel on reading this is but one small component of being a member of my tribe- the white, western, anglo tribe- the most advanced, civilized  people the world has ever known - always trying to better the lot of ourselves and those around us.. Our civility and compassion will be our downfall it seems. Charge them, try them, sterilize them, then lock them up to the full extent of our laws- the ones we wrote to define our civilized societies. </p>

		<p>I am sure that this story will be the center of all the court programs.  We won&rsquo;t hear anymore more of that white Casey Anthony stuff. Yep I am sure of it. </p>

		<p>The average black watches TV seven mind-numbing hours a day, so you can see why she was so angry.</p>
<p>After all, without the boob tube there was nothing for her to do.</p>
<p>What was she supposed to do, read a book? Spend more time with with her child? C&rsquo;mon, that&rsquo;s crazy talk!</p>

		<p>These stories sicken me- I would like to add that when you hear stories like this it is almost always &#8220;mom&rsquo;s boyfriend&#8221; or &#8220;dad&rsquo;s girlfriend&#8221; who batters a child to death when they are babysitting. </p>

<p><i>An Ohio woman convicted of killing her month-old baby daughter in a microwave oven.. turned it on after a fight with her boyfriend.</i> </p>
<p>All horrific crimes, not one of them reported here on the West Coast.  </p>
<p>Yet, every day, day in and day out for the past month, I hear hourly updates on the Caylee Anthony case from over 2,000 miles away   &mdash;   with color photos of her mother/killer splashed across the front pages of the local newspapers, daily.</p>
<p>This is because they are White.</p>

		<p>The NYC tabloids could probably publish a separate daily on black abuse of their kids.  Moreover, one half of American black women&rsquo;s pregnancies are aborted; in NYC, it&rsquo;s almost 3/4.</p>

<p>Considering the findings of the 2010 census which can be found on todays edition of Fox news website this can only be a good thing, yes?</p>

		<p>I just recently vacationed from NYC, and not ONE single newspaper advertised these stories on the front page. I did see the news on TV, but no photo as always becausen of a certain fearful reason. <br>
And yes, the Casey Anthoney trial has been old news like O.J.&rsquo;s trial. Nobody truly cares because this stuff happens everyday. Just her name being recognizable is the only reason the media think they can get attention. <br>
I promise you&rsquo;ll never see a nationally televised murder trial of someone named Dominishqua Tavaris</p>

		<p>A bit OT, but look at the &#8220;lady&rsquo;s&#8221; reasoning:  She didn&rsquo;t seek help for fear of getting into &#8220;trouble.&#8221;   I have seen blacks discuss slavery in Africa, where they grudgingly admit it occurred, but claim the slaves were granted all sorts of humanitarian &#8220;rights.&#8221;  With no white man, and no police, courts, doctors, social workers, lawyers etc around for 10,000 miles  &mdash;  -indeed the existence of the white man, obviously, was unknown to Africans for most of their history  &mdash;  -with no one around to put the African in &#8220;trouble&#8221; why on earth would he grant his slaves any &#8220;rights&#8221;? The presence of US is a huge mitigating factor in the brutality of non-whites; but at what cost?</p>
