			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Brooks, Reuters, June 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A so-called &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221; bill that would have allowed a crackdown on cities providing sanctuary to illegal immigrants died when the Texas legislature adjourned for another two years without passing it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the sanctuary cities bill was far less restrictive than the measure passed in Arizona, and it was championed by Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry, who is considering running for president.</p>
<p>Political analysts expected it to sail through the Republican-dominated legislature.</p>
<p>While Republican party infighting and rivalry between the two chambers of the legislature were factors in its demise, shocked conservatives and Tea Party supporters blamed so-called &#8220;Country Club&#8221; Republicans with close ties to business.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In that election [of 2010], Texas voters, much like the rest of the country, swept Republicans into office in historic numbers. For the first time in well over a century, Republicans enjoy a supermajority in the Texas House and just one seat shy of that in the Senate. Among those swept into office in Texas were several Hispanic Republicans.</p>
<p>Two powerful Texas businessmen joined the lobbying against the bill, legislative sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>Houston homebuilder Bob Perry and grocery chain magnate Charles E. Butt hired one of Austin&rsquo;s most powerful lobbyists to oppose the legislation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Texas is not the only state where powerful business interests have expressed reservations. After Georgia&rsquo;s Republican-led legislature passed a tough new anti-immigration law, farm groups expressed concern that the measure would staunch the flow of workers to help with harvesting crops. And in Utah, business interests helped to moderate proposals there. The package passed by the Utah legislature included a guest worker program as well as restrictions on immigration.</p>

<p>This was a clear setback but some help came from DC.  Congressman Lamar Smith introduced a bill that immigration enforcement patriots have been demanding for decades.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;Legal Workforce Act&#8221;   Smith&rsquo;s bill mandates the use of the federal E-Verify program by all employers across the nation. </p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s bill allows an exemption for seasonal workers in agriculture who return to the same job each year.  And it does not preempt state laws in other areas of immigration enforcement.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Republicans dominate the legislature but refuse to get the job done.&#8221;</p>
<p>You mean there are still some Americans that think so-called conservatives, are going to solve illegal immigration and the on going cultural conquest of the U.S. by Mexico? Fifty million here so far and counting, so I&rsquo;m voting for a &#8220;CONSERVATIVE&#8221; in order to get rid of Obama, because they&rsquo;re aware of what&rsquo;s happening.(tongue in cheek) </p>
<p>P.S. The fact is, &#8220;conservatives&#8221;,&#8221;Republicans&#8221; or whatever other name they&rsquo;ll use in the future, have &#8220;known&#8221; whats been happening for a quarter century now. </p>

		<p>Guess these traitorous business men don&rsquo;t care about the welfare of unemployed Texans, nor the safety of all its citizens. Little Ricky is pretending to want to abolish the sanctuary cities in Texas, knowing that it wouldn&rsquo;t pass. It will be the same old, same old. Perry definitely won&rsquo;t get my vote. When he looks for votes, let him go to the &#8220;Latinos&#8221; cause he sure won&rsquo;t get mine!</p>

<p>====</p>
<p>Economist Thomas Sowell has a useful analysis of why business lobbies are so eager to team up with leftist and ethnocentric organizations to gut enforcement of U. S. immigration laws   &mdash;  - what the clout of characters like &#8220;homebuilder Bob Perry&#8221; and &#8220;grocery chain magnate Charles E. Butt&#8221; means for ordinary, often unemployed American citizens:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Leaving prices out of the picture is probably the source of more fallacies in economics than any other single misconception. At current wages for low-level jobs and current levels of welfare, there are indeed many jobs that Americans will not take. The fact that immigrants  &mdash;  and especially illegal immigrants  &mdash;  will take those jobs is the very reason the wage levels will not rise enough to attract Americans &hellip; . It is elementary supply and demand. Yet we continue to hear about the &#8216;need&rsquo; for immigrants to do jobs that Americans will not do  &mdash;  even though these are all jobs that Americans have done for generations before mass illegal immigration became a way of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>OR   &mdash;  - in the less delicate words of Michael Scott of Glendora, California   &mdash;  - in the Los Angeles Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;President Bush&rsquo;s &#8216;willing workers&rsquo; concept is little more than a national job fair for businesses and private residents that don&rsquo;t want to pay living wages. </p>
<p>&#8220;A &#8216;willing worker&rsquo; is generally a desperately poor, unskilled individual from the Third World seeking almost any kind of work. A &#8216;willing employer&rsquo; is generally a mercenary and conniving firm or individual offering employment to willing workers at non-living wages and with terrible working conditions. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is a marriage made in hell, on the backs of innocent U.S. workers, taxpayers, who are forced to pay $8.7 billion annually in unfunded mandates to support 2.9 million illegal aliens, just here in California &hellip;&#8221; (Los Angeles Times, May 22, 2005) </p>

		<p>The voters in Texas need to either recall these &#8220;Republicans&#8221; or get in their face and let them know that they will be thrown out in the next election. They need to be confronted everywhere they go. There should also be an organized boycott of any businesses that opposed this bill.<br>
As I&rsquo;ve said before, Republican and conservative are two different things, thats why I always refer to myself as a conservative not a Republican.    </p>

		<p>These country club Republicans sure are short sighted. They may get cheap labor today, but in the future these third worlders will become a permanent bloc vote of the Left should they ever obtain the right to vote (say with an amnesty). TAnd you can bet the ranch that if this were to happen, liberals will enact even more anti-business measures than we have </p>

		<p>   How often I&rsquo;ve walked in chain stores to be assisted by 3rd world employees . But an aging, down on his luck white guy can go in and get down on his knees begging for a job and he is not going to get one .</p>
<p>   All of this is just too similar to the bondsmanship system of an earlier America . Today 3rd worlders clamor for jobs Americans allegedly do not want . Tomorrow their descendents will be seeking reparations for having been forced into what they will label a form a of slavery .  </p>

		<p>Patriots..Americans..you can duplicate what we just accomplished in Maryland. Turn to the Referendum process, take this to the <br>
people of Texas inthe form of a Referendum, ie. &#8220;Should all Federal adn State monies be withheld from &#8220;Sactuary Cities? Yes? or Now. Do  it now while the people of Texas still exist as a white majority.<br>
Then go after every one of these legislators and  at the next election get rid of them.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying it for years:  The business community can&rsquo;t be trusted at all on immigration.  They value cheap labor above loyalty to country or community.  By the way, what can you say about a rich man named &#8220;Butt?&#8221; </p>
