			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anissa Haddadi, International Business Times, June 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the opening day of the trial of the nine men, a court heard how seven teenage girls, the youngest of them is 13 years old, were groomed into child prostitution with offers of alcohol, drink and cash by nine men in a sex-trafficking ring.</p>
<p>As the trial started the prosecution revealed how some of the girls were sold on to other men to be abused, and one 15-year-old girl was plied with drink, drugs and cigarettes to persuade her to have sex with others as a &#8220;favour&#8221; to her &#8220;pimps&#8221;, the prosecution said.</p>
<p>Deborah Gould, prosecuting, warned the jury that as the trial unfolded they would be introduced to a world &#8220;that I expect few of you were aware of&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apparently most of the girls involved thought &#8220;to be loved and in love&#8221; with the men at the time.</p>
<p>The men, who are aged between 21 and 59, including a group of three brothers, operated mainly around the small town of Wellington, near Telford and face a total of 55 charges including rape, child prostitution, sexual activity with a child and trafficking children within the UK.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;This case is about exploitation,&#8221; said Debbi Gould, prosecuting. &#8220;The Crown say that the men in the dock variously trafficked, raped or sexually abused girls both over and under the age of 16 years over a considerable period of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three of the men, brothers Ahdel Ali, 23; Mubarek Ali, 28; and Tanveer Ahmed, 39; are accused of acting as &#8220;pimps&#8221; and exploited their victims. Others, including Abdul Rouf, 34, and the oldest defendant Mohammed Younis, 59, used their homes as brothels to allow men to engage in sexual activities with the girls, the court heard.</p>
<p>Jurors were told the men usual tactics to entice the girls revolved around offers of car rides, employment and cash, before they started grooming and exploiting them either for their own sexual gratification or to earn money. Some of the girls were treated as sexual commodities as they were sold or &#8220;given&#8221; to other males.</p>
<p>Two girls, who cannot be named, were &#8220;slowly but surely&#8221; persuaded by the brothers through a combination of attention, gifts, encouragement, pressure and guilt to have sexual activity with others for their benefit, the prosecutor told the court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having established that their victims were prepared to accommodate that to please them, the next logical step was to encourage them to do this for payment,&#8221; Gould told the jury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pimps, for that is what the Crown says that Ahdel Ali, Mubarek Ali and Tanveer Ahmed are, identified and then exploited their victims&rsquo; need for attention and protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>On one occasion, the men, assisted by Noshad Hussain, 20, are said to have used one girl as a child prostitute and transported her to different locations to meet men.</p>
<p>At the time they provided the victim with plenty of drinks, cannabis and cigarettes and pressured her into have sex with others as a &#8220;favour&#8221; to them.</p>
<p>The court also hear how on a different day, she was allegedly driven to a park in Stoke-on-Trent to meet a man from Bradford to perform oral sex.</p>
<p>&#8220;They sold her as a sexual object to others,&#8221; Gould said. &#8220;She was acting as a child prostitute, they were controlling and organising her activities &hellip; and transporting her to different locations in order that she could undertake these activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile details of how two of the girls were groomed in a churchyard in Telford where young Asian males congregated to drink and smoke also surfaced.</p>
<p>One 15-year-old is also alleged to have performed oral sex on Mohammed Ali Sultan, 24, on three occasions.</p>
<p>The jury members were warned that what they were likely to be distressed by some of the evidence in the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will neither like nor be impressed by the behaviour, attitudes and morals of some of the defendants in this case, most of whom are married men,&#8221; said Gould.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Crown says that just as the defence will accuse the girls of telling lies, so too have the defendants lied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t be bamboozled, don&rsquo;t be confused and don&rsquo;t be misled. The psychology of abuse and our understanding of it has greatly changed in recent years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahdel Ali, 23; Mubarek Ali, 28; Tanveer Ahmed, 39; Mohammed Ali Sultan, 24; Noshad Hussain, 21; Mohammed Islam Choudrey, 52; Marhoof Khan, 33; Mohammed Younis, 59; and Abdul Rouf, 34; deny all the charges against them.</p>
<p>The case continues.</p>

		<p>Grooming?</p>
<p>Has anybody else noticed that when a gang of Asians (almost always Pakistani) men do this they are described as groomers in the British press. Yet if a ring of white men get caught doing this their pictures are all over the press with the P word (paedophile) in huge letters.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll lay you ten to one that they&rsquo;ll be found innocent.  Even if they are found guilty, they&rsquo;ll get like 1-3 years probation and counseling.  Then the liberal organizations will blame &#8216;white racism&rsquo; for &#8216;forcing&rsquo; the Indian men to this &#8216;desperate&rsquo; life of crime, which was really their &#8216;cry for help&rsquo; against discrimination.  Liberals in California do these very things all the time!</p>

		<p>So don&rsquo;t the pansies in UK&rsquo;s newspapers call them by the collective title, Asians?  Well by the names we know they are Muslims, some of the nastiest people on the face of the earth.  First, they are told by their religious leaders that Christian women and girls are fair game for the sex slave trade.  And secondly, these goons know fully well that they are destroying Western culture and civilization.  Of course you know that in its place, Islam and Sharia will be replacing Western ways.</p>

		<p>As an Asian American, I find it offensive that these Muslims are considered Asians. This gives us all a bad name. The difference between Christianity and Islam is that Christians are encouraged to develop self control and self control is seen as a fruit of the spirit. Obviously, self control is not a virtue among Muslims. In some Muslim sects, men are able to get into temporary marriages, which are liasons with women other than their spouse, and this is not considered adultery. Women do not have this privledge and are expected to be virgins upon marriage and faithful to their husband after marriage.</p>

		<p>The real story here is that all this went on with the consent of the British government, on all levels.  Sure, this instance is (at least it appears to be) being prosecuted.  But for so many years and so many other cases, it was not.  The most blatant cases receive a slap on the wrist at best.  And heaven help, say, the father who attempts to put an end to this.  Although his daughters rapists might do a few months in prison, the father who punches one of them might do a few decades in prison for &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Minimal appropriate response to this.  Death sentence for those involved&hellip;..mass deportations of all other muslims.  Restricted travel to and from the countries involved.</p>
<p>However, a sane society would, instead, literally declare war on the muslim populations and wipe them from the face of the earth.  They are a population that insist a state of eternal war exists against non-muslims&hellip;..and they are serious about it.  The natural response would be to recognize that state of war, and fight that war until the enemy is defeated.  And since they define that as only when the last muslim is gone&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, few people seem to be sane.</p>
<p>Who is worse.  The muslim man who rapes the infidels daughter or the white man who lets him do it with impunity.</p>

<p>These monsters are NOT Indian. They are Pakistanis. Stop looping these losers with us. We have nothing to do with them. Infact Indians in Britain are among the wealthiest and best educated ethnic groups. Also, the media needs to stop using PC terms like  &#8220;groomers&#8221; - just refer to them as Moslems, better still Pakistani Moslems.</p>

<p>You should be.  The PC catchall term &#8220;Asians&#8221; was invented for the purpose of blurring racial boundaries and making it harder to determine exactly what <i>race</i> an &#8220;Asian&#8221; actually is.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there were Orientals, Indians, Pakistanis, Polynesians and a few other racial groups scattered across various parts of Asia, all of them referred to specifically by name.  Now we&rsquo;re supposed to pretend that they&rsquo;re all just part of one polyglot mass of raceless &#8220;Asians.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole idea of this Orwellian nonsense is to make it more difficult for us to discuss race in any meaningful way at all.<br>

		<p>These FN muslims will get some serious sentences ranging from community service all the way to suspended 6 month sentences. England fears the muslims more than American politicians and MSM does right now, the same fear will take over in America when the muslim % increases to the point that the muslims know they can begin to challenge law enforcement and even the military and get away with it because we KNOW &#8220;mustn&rsquo;t outrage muslims or blacks&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is a whole slew of similar cases going through the British courts.<br>
 It appears to a systematic, nationwide pattern of abuse inculcated amongst pakistanis.<br>
 Of course, the whole idea is to preserve pakistani women as pure and virginal whilst using stupid, sily young White girls as prostitutes.<br>
 It is a timely warning to Britain of the character and behavior to be expected from pakistanis and their exploitative, tribal nature.This will only get worse as the pakistani population exponentiates in the future and will, as a matter of fact, eclipse the indigenous population.</p>

		<p>The girls involved are, of course, young white girls and these actions were publicised by the Britiah National Party a couple of years or more ago but the leader, Nick Griffin and the BNP was once again branded liars and racists by the liberal and  Left Wing fools who really have a lot to answer for now.<br>
The Muslim men cannot do this to Muslim girls as they would get their throats cut PDQ but in their twisted mentality it is OK to corrupt those who are not Muslims.<br>
Being 73 years old now, I have no career to be ruined by the Left Wing/Liberal fools so I am not afraid to give my name etc. here or anywhere the truth needs to be published.  While racism cannot be claimed as the motivation for their crimes, it should be classed as seriously as that crime in the eyes of the Law.  If it was one of my daughters/grand-daughters&hellip;&hellip;.. Sharia Law would be applied; personally.</p>

MUSLIM MEN RAPE FOUR BRITISH SCHOOLGIRLS AT AMUSEMENT PARK<br>
Another instance of muslim violence is this disgusting rape of four thirteen year old schoolgirls, on an innocent trip to an amusement park, who were raped and sexually assaulted by muslim men/paedophiles. The rapes and assaults occurred on the queue for and on the roller coaster. This horrific rape of young girls is becoming all too common and the UK is not alone in the escalating numbers of victims of muslim rape. Now what does the Quran/Islam tell us about muslim men raping kafir or non-muslim girls?: &#8220;Islam gives an open license to Muslim men to have sexual intercourse with women as long as these women are not Muslims and/or when these Muslim men are living in an infidel country.&#8221; And in regards to paedophilia   &mdash;  This is what Imam Khomeini, the top shia authority says: &ldquo;A Muslim man can have sexual pleasure with a little girl as young as a baby. But he should not penetrate her vaginally, however he can sodomize her&rdquo;. (Tehriro vasyleh, fourth edition, Qom, Iran, 1990) We are also told that the Prophet Mohammed was married to a six year old girl and consummated the marriage when little Aisha was just nine years old:- A&rsquo;ishah said: &#8220;The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) married me when I was six and had sexual intercourse with me when I was nine and I was playing with dolls&#8221;. Let us also remember. according to Islamic beliefs - that women/girls not wearing headscarves or dressing in Western clothing are &#8220;asking for rape&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>The psychology of abuse and our understanding of it has greatly changed in recent years.</i></p>
<p>Yeah, just like in the US, Gould, the &#8220;understanding&#8221; of abuse and pedophilia is to look for &#8220;root causes&#8221; such as &#8220;feelings of oppression from the dominant culture&#8221;, i.e, White Culture to explain away child rape (but this only applies for non-White cultures, mind you, for Whites, especially for those who wear the collar, child rape is a capital offense, its offenders subjected to LWOP, attendant prison abuse and bankrupting fines   &mdash;   the Catholic Archdiocese in Los Angeles coughed up <i>$660 million</i> to disappear its pedophilia problems).</p>
<p>From Drudge yesterday:</p>
<p><i>The World&rsquo;s Five Most Dangerous Countries for Women</i></p>
<p>1.  Afghanistan</p>
<p>2.  Congo</p>
<p>3.  Pakistan</p>
<p>4. India  </p>
<p>5.  Somalia</p>
<p>India:  Top issues for women are female feticide (selective abortion and infanticide), child marriage, women trafficking, and domestic servitude.</p>
<p>About 45 percent of girls are married before they turn 18. <i>India registered the highest trafficking risk among the countries in the poll.</i></p>
<p>But, as #2 writes:   <i>The liberal organizations will blame &lsquo;White racism&rsquo; for &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; the Indian men to this &lsquo;desperate&rsquo; life of crime, which was really their &lsquo;cry for help&rsquo; against discrimination.</i></p>
<p>Pakistan: Child marriage and forced marriage are a threat. Women who defy expectations have faced acid attacks as well as punishment by stoning.</p>
<p>Indeed, more than 1,000 females die in honor killings every year&hellip; 90 percent of women are victims of domestic violence at some point. There is no such thing as marital rape in Pakistani law; five of the six men convicted in a high-profile gang rape case were acquitted earlier this year.</p>
<p><i>And secondly, these goons know fully well that they are destroying Western culture and civilization.</i></p>
<p>The Indians and Pakistanis are only doing what is normal for them and what they&rsquo;re allowed to do in the UK (and the US as well).</p>
<p>The real goons are the anti-White government officials who allow massive immigration from these types of cultures into White Homelands   &mdash;    the ultimate goal, being, to destroy Whites, White homelands and Western Civilization.</p>
<p>And, it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>Any objections, you racist White Kulaks?  Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

		<p>Historically, people who were considered Asian were either of East Asian (Japanese, Chinese Korean, Vietnamese) etc. and Malay (Filipinos and Malaysians). Indians and Pakistanis were considered Caucasians. I read somewhere this changed after Indians and Pakistanis immigrated to the US and wanted to get business loans designated for minorities and those groups were added to the &#8220;Asian&#8221; racial category. Pacific Islanders are also part of the &#8220;Asian&#8221; racial category and Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Fijians, and Tongans are Pacific Islanders.</p>

&gt;&gt;<br>
The real story here is that all this went on with the consent of the British government, on all levels.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Back when I first started reading about this in the 90s, the UK cops knew, _knew_, to a street corner and vehicle plate number, which of these wonderful examples of humanity were operating in their neighborhoods.  And all their victims, by face and name.</p>
<p>The problem was, these &#8216;Asians&rsquo; used _young men_ (of equal or slightly older age to the victim group but still under the cutoff for statutory vs. real rape charges) as intermediaries.  Men who were recruited in Pakistan and could be sent back there if things got too hot.</p>
<p>Sending these young people into the malls etc. to evaluate the young, impressionable, trusting, women who went to the malls solely to be socially &#8216;seen&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It was these young male &#8216;shoppers&rsquo; who (over several visits) selected the target girl and used compliments, food, entertainment and eventually, gifts up to fairly expensive jewelry, to get them to go outside -with them-, whereupon they got into to these big limos and other expensive sedan type (driven = maximum control over a woman who screams rape) vehicles.</p>
<p>And that was that.</p>
<p>The UK cops hadn&rsquo;t enough men to track them very far and if the they intervened at the pickup why, these grandfatherly types were only driving the girl home and neither they nor the boys wouldn&rsquo;t get more than a slap on the wrist _because they hadn&rsquo;t done anything_.</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>By the same token, it was the older men who kept the drugs, booze and weapons at their own rented-in-another-name houses which is where they upped the ante.  Not at their own homes.  Oh no, these were &#8216;proper gentlemen&rsquo;, they would never take a piece of street meat home to family.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Sure, this instance is (at least it appears to be) being prosecuted. But for so many years and so many other cases, it was not.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Yes and whose fault is it that we let OUR girls go out unaccompanied and hold themselves in such little self-respect that they trade their bodies for _trinkets_?</p>
<p>Let me add that this happened first in Northern and Mid Country England whose industrial centers have long been written off by both sides of UK Labour/Conservative politics-</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/SJd0t" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/SJd0t</a></p>
<p>As outsourcing of industry has resulted in a &#8216;middle class&rsquo; which is basically a working poor or on lifetime dole.  There is not a lot of pride or wealth to go around there, so -anything- that rolls into town with a wad of cash is &#8216;interesting&rsquo; to a certain kind of girl.</p>
<p>Yet now these same larger cities (Liverpool, Birmingham etc.) are split into no-go zones as ethnic enclaves because the whites quickly caught on to what their neighbors were really like.</p>
<p>The real defining factor is of course: devaluation of money.  A man with a little cash in England can move mountains in Pakistan and so these immigrants continue to do things in their own countries (drugs, weapons, electronics, protection rackets) that would get them multi-decade sentences if they were still here.</p>
<p>But they are not, having &#8216;retired&rsquo; to a defacto multinational condition.  Because Crime Does Pay.  If you know when to get up from the table and walk away.</p>
<p>Where no one has been proud enough of white culture to protect their own since WWII, we have no means of matching these men&rsquo;s ability to buy what they want.  Because, as of yet, the lowering of cultural values has not resulted in a sin-infested sewer which drives a culture of easy money.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The most blatant cases receive a slap on the wrist at best. And heaven help, say, the father who attempts to put an end to this. Although his daughters rapists might do a few months in prison, the father who punches one of them might do a few decades in prison for &ldquo;racism&rdquo;.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Not if they don&rsquo;t find the body.  And it&rsquo;s quickly coming to exactly that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Minimal appropriate response to this. Death sentence for those involved&hellip;..mass deportations of all other muslims. Restricted travel to and from the countries involved.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I agree.  It will never happen though, because a &#8216;capitalist&rsquo; society is one which depends on influxes of the poorest to support a junk consumerist approach to volume commerce.  And they breed (cousin to cousin, with horrific effects on the UK medical system, courtesy of a massive load of congenital diseases) at hugely greater TFRs than whites do.  Which accelerates the safe-havening of entire areas.  Where this kind of crime is simply not reported.</p>
<p>Furthering an endemic cultural condition by which nobody having any cultural restraint to exo-groups makes every ethnic a predator and every white native a victim.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
However, a sane society would, instead, literally declare war on the muslim populations and wipe them from the face of the earth. They are a population that insist a state of eternal war exists against non-muslims&hellip;..and they are serious about it. The natural response would be to recognize that state of war, and fight that war until the enemy is defeated. And since they define that as only when the last muslim is gone&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The World Jewish Congress made the mistake of declaring war on Hitler and insodoing devastated Europe, twice.  First with their own deaths.  And now with a pointless savaging of our culture with implied ethnic cleansing guilt.</p>
<p>I do not want to see the U.S. become the next Nazi Germany.  The UK doesn&rsquo;t have the room to make a stand, should they make that choice.  And so they will be overrun by the combination of UK military and ethnic racial identity.</p>
<p>What is important to remember from this illustration is that history distorts the reality of WWII as a commercial, for-profit, enterprise so huge that American Ball Bearings were put on South American freighters to go to Nazi Germany within days after the 8th AF &#8216;broke the rules&rsquo; of target selection and blew up Schweinfurt and Regensburg, which, on it&rsquo;s own, should have ended the war in 6-8 weeks, late in 1943.</p>
<p>Hap Arnold said he had no clue how the Luftwaffe got all the aircraft they threw at us into the air that day (60 bombers shot down outright, another 100+ so badly shot up, they and their crews would never fly again, deep penetration raids officially &#8216;cancelled&rsquo; until the new year.  Nominally because there were no long range escorts.  Truthfully so that Germany could recover&hellip;), except that someone had told them.</p>
<p>If our elites are wiling to engage in those kinds of undertable shenanigans with an international, wartime, threat during the 1940s when people actually cared enough to have publicly lynched them for such a magnitude of treachery, do you really think that a little thing like rape and murder of lower middle class whites by &#8216;Asians&rsquo; in the rundown cities of the UK, long since abandoned by the Elites, will make any difference to the racial politics of these upper classes?</p>
<p>The reality is that NOBODY WANTS TO LIVE IN SWA.  Or Africa.  Or most of Eastern Asia.  Between the weather, the overpopulation, the disease, the endemic poverty and the callous attitudes that go with all of these, we in the West would be perfectly safe from all these places and their inhabitants, if only we didn&rsquo;t invite them out from under their rocks.</p>
<p>Cancel their IMF loans.  Refuse all further subsidies for food and immigration.  Deny any trades in currency.  And these nations would rapidly die in place.</p>
<p>Unable to make a first world existence sustain itself in a third world environment.  As their populations starvation-crashed around them.  Something we should SEE, first hand, before we commit to making The West look like Islamabad.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Unfortunately, few people seem to be sane.</p>
<p>Who is worse. The muslim man who rapes the infidels daughter or the white man who lets him do it with impunity.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Sanity is a matter of perspective.  I don&rsquo;t believe in a 30hr work week X2 jobs at 6-8 dollars an hour for 25 years until you are too old to keep going and spend the last 5-10 years of your life without medical insurance or SSI.  That is a step back for our quality of life, utterly unjustified by the endless influx of a permanent welfare underclass who live, essentially, for free.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t believe in transferring our industry to the Far East where wage slaves pay off the IMF loans in places like ex-Suharto&rsquo;s Indonesia, at a dollar a day earned income _solely_ for the profit margins of the major corporations.</p>
<p>Because that makes us no better than Hitler, sending Jews &#8216;to the East&rsquo; as expendable slave laborers.</p>
<p>As I said, nobody wants these miserable peoples&rsquo; wretched landscapes so the notion of genocide is a waste of immorality for no gain.  If they are &#8216;safe&rsquo; where they are and it is only our elites who wish to import ever more of them, here, to ruin our lives.  Then it&rsquo;s time we looked at Defeat In Detail attacking the smaller threat whose control over the nature of distributionist-centrist capitalism (money here, industry over there) is what is directly responsible for creating a generation of rich &#8216;Asians&rsquo; who still have no morals.</p>
<p>Certainly our elites are more proximately &#8216;fixable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As for the blame game, I don&rsquo;t go for kicking the victim either.  A good stern talking to and a constant regimen of family time as oversight would sort these young white women who might want to date Muslims so that -someone- would pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Or it won&rsquo;t and they are doomed to Darwinian selection out of our gene pool and into someone else&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not pretend that we are to blame because someone else does something to us.  Blame doesn&rsquo;t stop them from trying.  It only paralyzes us from coming together to stop them from succeeding.</p>

		<p>Mohammed married Aisha when she was 6 and had intercourse with her when she was 9.  As soon as they were married when she was 6 he practiced frottage to ejaculation with her daily.</p>
<p>This is according to Mohammed&rsquo;s writings.</p>

		<p>Poster #6 Indian</p>
<p>I fully understand how you feel about being linked with child raping and pimping pashtun pakistanis.</p>
<p>But it is your own government&rsquo;s fault for calling every race and ethnicity that is something other than sub saharan black african or European   &#8220;Asian&#8221;</p>
<p>Does the government of England call blue eyed kurds asian? Are fair skinned brown haired Persians and Armenians Asian? What does the government of England call Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodians etc?</p>
<p>If you read this Indian poster, I&rsquo;d really like to know.</p>

Indians have reclassified themselves as &#8220;Asians&#8221; so as to get affirmative action college admissions, jobs and government set aside community development loans and tax breaks for their businesses.</p>
<p>If classified as Caucasian or White, Indians would be denied college admission no matter how high their test scores and school grades, denied employment no matter how superior their qualifications and experience because of affirmative action preference for anything but white.</p>
<p>They would also be denied government help in their business and would be unable to bid for government contracts because Whites are not allowed in government contracting.</p>
<p>So Indians have a price to pay for their affirmative action privileges, being classed with pashtun pakistani pimps.  But the rewards of being asian instead of White are enormous in terms of jobs and money.</p>
