			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Dagge, Christian Science Monitor, June 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asian-born Australians are on the brink of overtaking their European-born counterparts for the first time in the country&rsquo;s history. More than 2 million Asians now call Australia home, according to new figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The number of Asians in Australia has almost doubled in a decade, from 1.03 million in mid-2000 to 2.1 million in the middle of last year. Around half  &mdash;  like Kumar  &mdash;  have come as students, the remainder as skilled migrants or through family reunification programs.<br>
This in a country that formerly drafted immigration policy in an effort to protect against the &#8220;yellow peril.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be sure, Australia still battles racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Close to 1 in 10 people in Australia are born in Asia,&#8221; says Bob Birrell, a director at Monash University&rsquo;s Centre for Population and Urban Research. &#8220;There is nothing like that in other countries including the US or Canada, which are considered highly multicultural. It is a massive shift and it has happened over a very short time span.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ABS data measured residents, meaning not all those counted will become citizens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible transformation for a country that ran a &#8220;white Australia&#8221; immigration policy until the early 1970s  &mdash;  a policy that overwhelmingly targeted Asians. In 1947, just 0.3 percent of Australians had been born in Asia. Last year, the figure stood at 9 percent. European-born Australians make up 10.8 percent of the country&rsquo;s 22.6 million people  &mdash;  a long way from the 17 percent they represented several decades ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Controversial politician Pauline Hanson gave birth to a new political force when, during her maiden address to the Australian Parliament in 1996, she warned that the country was &#8220;in danger of being swamped with Asians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Running on an anti-immigration platform, her One Nation party collected close to a quarter of the vote in the 1999 Queensland State elections. In April, Hanson ran for a seat in the parliament. She lost, garnering less than 2.5 percent of the vote.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is a massive shift and it has happened over a very short time span.&#8221;</p>
<p>It happened because bankers and financial elites successfully steered politicians in white countries like Australia and the U.S. into approving a massive debt. </p>
<p>Only by chaining themselves to high immigration can they show the &#8216;growth&rsquo; which is now essential to keep their heads above water.</p>

		<p>the holier than thou white crowd need to stop and think why peoples of colored push and shove to land onto countries built by white brain power.  and then look with open eyes at the countries occupied by these people of color, majority of them are third world countries.  matter of fact, any higher civilization built by white brain power cannot be maintained once the whites leave these third world countries.  the only exception is Japan.  </p>

		<p>If Australia was still a white&rsquo;s only nation, I would sell everything I have, perfect my Aussie accent, and move there right now.  Besides, I have distant cousins there already.</p>

Everyone should be aware, that when the monsters who wrote this say the above sentence, they aren&rsquo;t talking about the ethnic cleansing of White Australians from Australia. They are talking about Whites wanting something of their own. That&rsquo;s the worst thing in the universe to these creatures.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t dream of applying this standard to non-Whites. To their simple, hate-addled minds, White = bad, non-White = good.</p>

		<p>Australia should never have abandoned the White Australia program. As with Britain the opening up of the country to non-whites was done by the Labour party. Immigration is a privilege, not a right. Australia was entirerly within its rights in exercising its natural preference for European immigration.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s an incredible transformation for a country that ran a &ldquo;white Australia&rdquo; immigration policy until the early 1970s &mdash; a policy that overwhelmingly targeted Asians.&#8221; </p>
<p>A treacherous transformation is possibly a better decription. As recently as 1972 Australia was in Viet-Nam to protect us from Communism and the Yellow Peril.</p>
<p>Then in 1972 a socialist labour government was elected, they quietly dropped the white Australia policy and the Asians started arriving by the boat load and the plane load. Then a consevative government was re-elected in 1975 but its leader Mr J.M.Fraser made things worse advocating an almost open-door immigration policy, fortunately it has since been pulled back a little bit especially when Mr John Howard was PM.</p>
<p>Now have a look at the &#8220;new look&#8221;  typical family, say at a large shopping centre, yes, they are nearly all Asian, pregnant mother often wearing a burqua, baby in pram and several siblings, all being generously supported by the Australian taxpayer. By Asian I will also include, Arabs, Sudanese/Somalis, Indians, South-East Asians, Koreans and Chinese. With a few execeptions most of them are not very nice people, they just look after there own needs and do not intergrate with traditional Australian society.</p>
<p>The Anti-immigration One Nation Party lead by Pauline Hanson was very succesful for a short time but they failed due to internal divisions and lack of political skills as well as a total and hostile opposition from the established parties and the media.</p>
<p>It is time for all white people in the USA, Australia, Canada, NZ and UK and the EU to come to our senses before it is too late.</p>

		<p>This is a racial catastrophe beyond belief.  All further immigration in to Australia must stop.  Asians of various types comprise nearly half of the world&rsquo;s population (factoring in China, India, Southeast Asia etc etc), while Whites are only about 10% of the world&rsquo;s population.  Whites cannot allow their nations to be swamped by Asiatics or other non-White groups - Asia is a vast place stretching from Kazakhstan to Japan, Mongolia to India.  Yet still they are spreading into our sphere of influence.  Whites simply aren&rsquo;t allowed to have nations of our own for posterity, nations we built from nothing - only to have other racial groups come in and reap all the benefits and eventually take the whole country over.</p>

<p>They aren&rsquo;t all 85% white.</p>
<p>Australia is probably around 85% but dropping fast.<br>
New Zealand was only like 57% white from the latest data.<br>
Canada is around 80% but dropping fast.</p>

		<p>When they talk about racism in Australia, they tend to talk about it from the perspective of whites being racist towards anyone else. They never talk about the racism from immigrants coming into Australia. The media has this almost naive idea that only white Australian&rsquo;s are racist.  </p>
<p>Having been on the end of vicious Asian racism, I can tell you it is not pretty. And it is justified as being somekind of fair retaliation for all the bad things whites have done. </p>
<p>The whites who support multicultural immigration live in a bubble and have not thought about the consequences for future generations of white people in Australia.  </p>
<p>Because English is the international language most people can read, speak it, but English speakers are unable to understand what is being said about them around them, or what is being printed in the ethnic media produced in their own language. We get scrutinised for everything but are unable to scrutinise what other ethnic groups are saying because they do it in their own language. </p>

		<p>Forget picture postcards and Oprah shows in Australia.  They are merely facades, and not truly showing what&rsquo;s really going on here in Australia.  Australia has (like all Western countries) been swamped by non-white hordes.</p>
<p>Although living well, a feeling of depressive realism has descended over me within the past five years.  I was born, bred and &#8216;buttered&rsquo; in Sydney, however, it is merely a sad shell of a place I grew up in during the 1970s. </p>
<p>Australia has, without doubt, lost its identity, as waves of third world tribes flood our cities.  Black Africans, &#8216;chip-on-the-shoulder&rsquo; Lebanese Muslims (usually second generation), Indians/Pakistanis/Sri Lankans/Bangladeshi, Pacific Islanders (Tongans, Samoans, NZ Maoris) are running amok here, crime wise.  The police are noticeably terrified of them.  Unfortunately, the young cops seem more intent on horsing around than nabbing these thugs.  </p>
<p>A young woman was involved in a car-jacking here in Sydney last night.  I was surprised to find out two black Africans were involved – usually Muslims and Pacific Islanders are the perps.  It&rsquo;s &#8216;good&rsquo; to see crime being shared around to our most recent arrivals – black Africans.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, until the average white Australian has his TV, football/cricket, or beer taken away, he&rsquo;ll go on life seemingly oblivious to what&rsquo;s going on around.</p>
<p>Yes, the Asian (Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indonesian) deluge here is very distressing, with no end in sight.  I pray for Australians to pull their heads out of the sand, however, until their greedy ways are reversed, I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope.<br>
