<h1>Mexico, Other Countries Join Ga. Immigration Suit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Bluestein, Google News, June 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexico and 10 other countries have joined the legal fight against Georgia&rsquo;s tough new immigration law, warning that the strict crackdown could jeopardize close ties between the U.S. and its Latin American neighbors.</p>
<p>The nations filed briefs late Wednesday in support of civil liberties groups who asked a federal judge to declare Georgia&rsquo;s new law unconstitutional and block it from taking effect. The filing marks a new phase in the legal showdown that has pitted Georgia&rsquo;s attorneys against groups who had threatened to challenge the law even before it was adopted by lawmakers.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s move also echoes the legal strategy it pursued to challenge tough new immigration rules enacted by other states. Attorneys representing Mexico filed briefs challenging similar legislation adopted in Arizona and Utah.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure, Mexico said, would strain diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Mexico, &#8220;interfering with the strategic diplomatic interests of the two countries and encouraging an imminent threat of state-sanctioned bias or discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru also filed briefs Wednesday in support of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The filing from Mexico said the country&rsquo;s top officials were closely watching the debate surrounding the Georgia measure. It said Mexican officials were dismayed when Georgia passed the law, which it said could impact millions of Mexican workers, tourists and students in the U.S., and millions more whose jobs depend on international trade.</p>

		<p>Here is an idea. Lets join in an alliance with Guatemalans, El Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Etc, etc who are in Me-Hico illegally, and protest Mexican laws about illegal aliens.  Maybe Mexicans can be taught the meaning about the word hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>I understand the indignation of many Americans over this blatant meddling. However, nothing can possibly top US meddling in the affairs of other nations. One could easily point to US efforts to &#8216;reshape the middle east&rsquo;. However, given the nature of this story, I will point towards Latin America.</p>
<p>The CIA regularly makes sure its favored candidate &#8216;wins&rsquo; elections throughout the region. The result are regimes subservient to mostly US based multi-national corporations (MNC). Usually this means the economic life of entire nations function solely to enrich MNC - at the expense of local citizens. Yet, angry Americans love to rail against Latin American governments that fail to provide for their citizens.</p>
<p>In the case of Mexico, it is obvious that the CIA rigged the &#8216;election&rsquo; of 2006 in favor of Felipe Calderon. Why? Well, as soon as Calderon was installed President of Mexico, he began efforts to sell of Mexico&rsquo;s state owned petroleum industries to US based MNC. He also unleashed the Mexican military on the country narcotics traffickers. Was this the quid pro quo?</p>
<p>US media headlines about a &#8216;Mexico Drug War&rsquo; are misleading. US agencies are coordinating the so called &#8216;Mexico Drug War&rsquo;. DEA, FBI, ATF, ICE, CIA etc have agents throughout Mexico. They monitor electronic activity - phone calls, emails, etc. They operate drones which collect further intel. THEY identify drug cartel bosses - and then call in the &#8216;Mexican&rsquo; military to kill them!</p>
<p>As such, calls by many a well intentioned American for Latin American countries to just get their act together ring hollow in the face of such overt US intervention throughout the region.</p>
<p>How about we cut off ALL immigration and let them fend for themselves?</p>
<p>Some Americans are now calling for US troops to enter Mexico (again) - ostensibly to neutralize the drug cartels. To them I say; be careful what you wish for. If US troops enter Mexico, illegal aliens in Georgia (and throughout the US) will be declared REFUGEES!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I strongly suspect the US is headed headlong towards another invasion of Mexico in the near future. You see, Mexico has a Presidential election come July 2012. Once the CIA favored candidate is declared the winner, expect to see open revolt throughout Mexico - &#8216;necessitating&rsquo; another US invasion.</p>

		<p>Now we know why Latin America doesn&rsquo;t have much in the way of social welfare programs.  That&rsquo;s because their governments are spending a good chunk of their money on lawyers to sue American states.  Maybe if they spent that money on welfare and social development instead of lawyers, their citizens wouldn&rsquo;t want to move to the United States, ergo state legislatures might not feel the need to pass these 1070-style crackdown legislative packages (but still should).</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be frank.  Third world countries are dumping their rejects on the Western World.  In this country, those rejects are used to get votes, cheap labor while the rest of the public are forced to support them and suffer from their crimes.  This will not end until either the majority of whites say no more, or this country is no more.</p>

		<p>The gall of the Mexicans, et al is stunning. Why do we permit this? We tell China, for example, to chill on the violating human rights program and they tell us to go suck a bug. So does everyone else we try to get to act like white folk. We need tell them all to suck a bug, and start rounding them up.</p>
<p>Mexico, et al, have an agenda here. We are the dump for their population overflow and they want to increase the throughput, and we are a significant source of revenue for their populations without which they might likely face widespread unrest. In their countries, the US minimum wage is like a six figure salary. Billions are sent back by the illegal immigrants here. Why do we permit that? Uncle Sam needs cash flow, so why not impose a 50% tax on any money sent out via Western Union or whatever to the &#8220;plaintiff&rsquo;s&#8221; countries? Then they&rsquo;ll have something to really scream about.</p>

		<p>Since the government of Mexico has legally intervened to strike down a duly enacted law of the sovereign State of Georgia, the Georgia governor should request the immediate closure of all Mexican diplomatic offices in that state.  Also, where are the lawsuits from Canada, Britain, Australia, France, Russia, Japan, and other countries? That&rsquo;s right! There are none because the illegal aliens are primarily from SOUTH of the border!</p>

		<p>I hope this ludicrous lawsuit is laughed out of court. I wish there were some way to get Calderon&rsquo;s passport or diplomatic immunity revoked. That man is as bad as his predecessor, Vicente Fox. For some reason, Mexican Presidents seem to think the US is here to take care of them and their corrupt country. Mexico is no better, maybe worse than any Midde Eastern country. It&rsquo;s savage and barbaric drug cartels are murdering their fellow citzens and anyone else who gets in their way. They need to be cut off from the rest of the world.</p>

Georgia, Arizona and other states are being forced into enforcing their own immigration laws because of the complete failure of the Obama administration.  There are U.S. troops all around the world defending foregin nations borders while America&rsquo;s are basicially wide open to the narco trade and terrorists. The most pressing question for America is whether the nation can survive Obama.</p>

		<p>States like Georgia definitely need to counter-sue. How many illegals are in the Georgia legal system in which Georgia tax-payers are on the hook for their upkeep? And why are these other countries not suing Mexico for their immigration laws which are much harser then the US laws? Oh, that&rsquo;s right, they know their citizens ultimate goal is the US, not Mexico, and getting anchored in so the remittance money can start flowing.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe ANY nation should meddle in the affairs of others. I have never believed that we should be trying to make a democracy out of the Middle East or anything else. I believe all nations, ours included, should run our own countries but also not bring other countries ie. immigrants into our nations either.</p>

There will never be a welfare system in Latin America, so long as these countries can simply send their downtrodden north until they cross our border illegally. Once here, they only have to start pumping out anchor babies (which comes naturally to these people) to gets their smorgasbord of entitlements rolling in.</p>
<p>The United States of America is Latin America&rsquo;s welfare system. This is why these countries are fighting so hard to protect their interests, which includes billions of dollars of remittances being pumped back into their countries each year.<br>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea, how about we start billing Mexico for the hundreds of millions their citizens (they&rsquo;re not Americans, they&rsquo;re illegals, remember?) cost US taxpayers in healthcare, education, and crime.  First place to start would be to cut off all the millions we send them in foreign aid.</p>

		<p>The fundamental problem is the unholy alliance between multinational countries and governments. The megacorporations want a world government as it reduces drastically the amount of money these corporations have to lay out in order to bribe corrupt politicians so that they will do their bidding. <br>
Add to that the problem of the US exporting democracy when we are no longer making any of that in the US, along with the rest of the things we are no longer making</p>

		<p>Lee #14, no need to wait for the money, just deduct it from the $100 million PER DAY the US is paying the Mexican government owned oil company for the oil it ships to the states. The oil company I might add, that was created from the nationalized British and American oil interests in Mexico.</p>

		<p>The fact that there is an obvious cognitive dissonance (if not functional discord)) between-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&hellip;.diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Mexico, &ldquo;interfering with the strategic diplomatic interests of the two countries&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Where diplomacy abroad is being allowed to supercede national interests at home (i.e. it&rsquo;s no longer being used to protect the people whom the government is empowered by), there is and should be NO loyalty by the ruled to the rulers.</p>
<p>Which should tell you all you need to know on why a foreign government is being used as a front for a desired policy argumentation which Obama cannot appear to again be fighting &#8216;the will of the people&rsquo; on.  Not if he wants to regain office.  Not if he doesn&rsquo;t want to make it _very clear_ that his is a brown-vs.-white agenda.</p>
<p>Democracy is pluralism, writ large.  We all know where that strategy comes from as &#8216;universalism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Pluralism is thus the _breakdown_ of national powerbase to so many sub-majority (ethnic) groups that only &#8216;coalitions&rsquo; of competing interests can pass and enforce laws that have been so watered down that they cannot possibly serve the people they represent, only the people who write them.</p>
<p>People who pay for the candidates of their choice to vote as plural blocks in getting those laws passed.  No matter what.</p>
<p>So it is that Capitalism is also a false god because it is also no longer _Mercantile_ driven, to conserve assets within a NATION whose ethnicity is homogenous.  Oligarchy by the many is still Ownership by the few who pay to wrest control from them.</p>
<p>We were better off when nationalism was restrictive to genelines.  Where the Holocaust was not used as a guilt-club to destroy PRIDE in our blood heritage.</p>
<p>And the only way to get that back is to break with the Federalist Super State regime that dictates that we submit to capitalism and democracy (as it is now practiced, with no controls over funding and &#8216;representation&rsquo; vs. real platform politics).</p>
<p>And we must do it soon.  Because the alternative to fighting our own, at home.  And fighting multinational corporations from overseas, will be one of never being able to reach our oppressors.</p>
<p>Or their bank accounts.</p>
<p>The USA is done.  Whites are not.  Yet.</p>
