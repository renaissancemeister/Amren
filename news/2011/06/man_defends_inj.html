<h1>Man Defends Injured Pirates Player&rsquo;s Wife in Road Rage Attack</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WPXI (Pittsburgh), June 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pittsburgh police said a man attacked the wife of Pirates catcher Chris Snyder following a traffic dispute while Snyder sat in the car, unable to get out because of back surgery last week.</p>
<p>Authorities said a passer-by and an off-duty police officer subdued Subhash Arjanbhi Modhwadia, 44, on Wednesday after he ripped a mirror off the car and started swinging at Carla Snyder in the city&rsquo;s Banksville neighborhood.</p>
<p>Investigators said Carla Snyder was driving when she narrowly avoided hitting the man, who was riding a scooter. Police said Modhwadia, of Scott Township, followed her to a BP gas station along Banksville Road and started kicking the vehicle.</p>
<p>Officials said Modhwadia bit a bystander who intervened then threw punches at him and the off-duty officer while holding a key between his fingers. Police said Modhwadia also threw a shoe at the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ripped off her mirror, tried to get at her. That&rsquo;s when we came out. Another guy came over and tackled him and put him on the ground and tackled him again,&#8221; witness Chuck Crooks said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Narrowly avoided hitting the man&#8221; I never understood how two people can do ten thousand dollars damage to each others car, then get out and calmly exchange drivers licenses. But then shoot each over a near miss? </p>

		<p>A white guy fought off Hodgie?  At last, a white man who has a pair.  I was beginning to wonder. </p>
<p>Hodgie committed several felonies in that attack.  Wonder if he plans on running for congress?  Maybe he&rsquo;s an NAACP staffer?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got ten bucks that says he voted for Obama&hellip;even if he ain&rsquo;t legal to vote!   How long to you think it will take for the ACLU to come to his defense?  </p>
<p><br>
Wonder if Eric Holder plans to sue the baseball player for human rights violations?   Bet they end up naming a street after him (Hodgie) not the white guy.     </p>
<p>He was on a skooter.  Was he wearing a helmet over his turban?   </p>
<p>I wonder if he was wearing one of those long white man-dresses like they wear in the middle east.  He was on a skooter., talk about wind resistance!  Or, blowing smoke up your skirt.  </p>
<p>Remember, Islam is a religion of peace!  Wonder what those blue-eyed devils did to set this poor guy off?</p>
<p>Lost of unanswered questions!  Wow.      <br>

		<p>The video strongly implies the woman was IN THE CAR! The guy threw his scooter in front of the car and then proceeded to kick the doors and rip off the mirror. </p>
<p>If some crazy guy on a scooter starts attacking the car why didn&rsquo;t she put it in gear? </p>

		<p>Some knucklehead rared back with a coke bottle to throw it at us the other day, because we were driving on the road he was walking in the middle of.  We usually like to see them jump out of the way rather than swerving into the other lane which could cause an accident which would then be our fault.</p>

<p>A Former Floridian Gives Yahoo Blog Credit For Reporting Race; We Disagree</p>
<p>From: &#8220;Fled From Florida&#8221;(Email him)</p>
<p>Credit should be given to the Yahoo Sports Blog for properly identifying the attacker of the MLB&rsquo;s Pittsburgh Pirates&rsquo; star catcher, Chris Snyder (who is white himself):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Placed on the disabled list with a herniated disk last week, the 30-year-old just underwent a back surgery that has severely limited his movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The procedure was so recent, in fact, that it prevented him from helping his wife Carla as she was attacked during a road rage incident in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about a tough spot to be in: Carla was driving Chris and their two children in a car in Pittsburgh when she almost collided with a man on a motor scooter. Police later identified that man as 44-year-old Subhash Arjanbhi Modhwadia.&rdquo;<br>
[Good Samaritans come to aid of Pirates catcher during road rage incident, June 16, 2011]</p>
<p>The article goes on to describe how the attacker, most likely of Middle Eastern descent of course, followed them to a gas station, blocked their escape and damaged the vehicle before being subdued by an off-duty cop and an off-duty fire fighter.  </p>
<p>The comment thread that this item sparked, ranging from untactful to informative to comical, show that the American people remain very aware of what&rsquo;s happening in this country despite the nonstop Politically Correct propaganda from the MainStream Media. </p>
<p>James Fulford writes: We&rsquo;re always glad to hear about these things from our readers. However, we think &ldquo;Fled From Florida&rdquo; is wrong to credit the Yahoo Sports Blog. Neither the blog itself nor the linked news stories hint at an attack committed by any of the following:</p>
<p>An immigrant<br>
An East Indian<br>
A Hindu<br>
A person of color</p>
<p>If Chris Snyder had not had a disabling back injury and had punched Mr. Modhwadia, injuring him, we would have heard about all of that. (Snyder is 6&rsquo;4&rsquo;, and weighs 240.) </p>
<p>The only reason we know anything is due to Subhash Arjanbhi Modhwadia himself, who comes from the Land Of The Funny Names, (in this case probably Gujarat, in India) and refused to change his name for the convenience of English speakers. </p>
<p>So our reader is the victim of an optical illusion &mdash; the MSM is still not reporting race, although as long as they report names, we can deduce.</p>

		<p>You seriously cannot quote an exceptional story like this to generalize all Indians. This nutcase does NOT represent the vast majority of Indians who are the wealthiest, best educated and most law abiding citizens of the United States. Statistics are on our side. However, if I were to quote tons of stories of white Americans acting crazy going beserk - committing some of the most horrific &amp; ridiculious crimes ranging from muder, theft, rapes, larceny etc&hellip;.I bet many here would jump on the bandwagon to justify and even rationalize the perp, simply because he/she&rsquo;s white. In this case, I&rsquo;m all in support for the cop who arrested this thug. White, Black,Arab, Oriental or Indian - a thug is a thug!</p>

		<p>Had Chris Snyder been able to defend his wife, would the local authorities have charged him with a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. Maybe not since he plays for the Pirates; but what if this had been John Smith, just an average guy? What would really be interesting is the day a Haji attacks the car of a Black Middle Linebacker who is 6&rsquo; 5&#8221; and weighs 300 lbs. What will the authorities do; no white person was involved (except maybe as a witness)?</p>
<p>Has anyone checked to see if Subhash is even here legally?   </p>

		<p>Perhaps, in the country that Mr. Subhash Arjanbhi Modhwadia is originally from such public altercations are not that unusual? Remember under multiculturalism, we have to accommodate our new citizen&rsquo;s languages, customs and mores for the sake of diversity  &mdash;  - after all &ldquo;diversity is our strength.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Drugs or prior history of psychosis?</p>
<p>If we were a dominant majority in our own nation, (I am talking about a 90% majority here) this would never have reached the news.</p>
<p>1.  Because this man would know better than to attack white indigenes.<br>
2.  Because we would, without exception, enforce license and insurance laws with hefty fines and jail time, to the point where people would NOT drive without them.<br>
3.  If this man pulled both these stunts, he would be aggressively instructed, at the scene, in why such vile behavior was not permitted against _anyone_ (let alone a woman with kids).<br>
4.  If he was naturalized, sent back to his country of origin.</p>
<p>My big hope is that #4 turns out to be true.  If it isn&rsquo;t, may the man make the repeated acquaintance of many big, mean, blacks during his prolonged incarceration.</p>
<p>IMO, this is the proof that no one respects us in our own lands.  Rather than back off when he&rsquo;d made his point and was facing increasing resistance, Modhwadia chose to escalate and escalate, thinking he could win against all comers.</p>

		<p>You only have to watch Deadliest Roads to see how these people drive in India/Pakistan. #12 you are right on: these kinds of public altercations are very common in those countries, and traffic accidents are very frequent. I&rsquo;m willing to bet my next paycheck that this guy was not following Western driving rules. Probably turned into her and expected her to move over as they do in India which we can all see on Deadliest Roads. I remember on the show some small white car tried to change lanes by driving directly into the next lane even though there was a truck there. The white canadian driver of course kept driving straight and smashed right into him. These people have absolutely no driving skills whatsoever. </p>

		<p>To White as a Ghost:</p>
<p>I agree 100% with what you say. These people are terrible drivers. I live in Toronto which is now overrun with Indians and Pakistanis. They cut me off all the time! They don&rsquo;t signal. They just move right into your lane! Just two days ago a Pakistani girl did this on the 401, (Toronto&rsquo;s busiest highway). She hit a car with five Canadians in it. The father died, the mother is also not expected to live and now three white children will probably be orphans!</p>
