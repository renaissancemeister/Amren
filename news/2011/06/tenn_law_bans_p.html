			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Timothy B. Lee, Ars Technica, June 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new Tennessee law makes it a crime to &#8220;transmit or display an image&#8221; online that is likely to &#8220;frighten, intimidate or cause emotional distress&#8221; to someone who sees it. Violations can get you almost a year in jail time or up to $2500 in fines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ban on distressing images, which was signed by Gov. Bill Haslam last week, is also an update to existing law. Tennessee law already made it a crime to make phone calls, send emails, or otherwise communicate directly with someone in a manner the sender &#8220;reasonably should know&#8221; would &#8220;cause emotional distress&#8221; to the recipient. If the communciation lacked a &#8220;legitimate purpose,&#8221; the sender faced jail time.</p>
<p>The new legislation adds images to the list of communications that can trigger criminal liability. But for image postings, the &#8220;emotionally distressed&#8221; individual need not be the intended recipient. Anyone who sees the image is a potential victim. If a court decides you &#8220;should have known&#8221; that an image you posted would be upsetting to someone who sees it, you could face months in prison and thousands of dollars in fines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another provision of the legislation governs law enforcement access to the contents of communications on social networking sites. The government can get access to &#8220;images or communications&#8221; posted to a social networking site by offering &#8220;specific and articulable facts,&#8221; suggesting that the information sought is &#8220;relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have said it before here, and I&rsquo;ll say it again, because it probably applies in this case   &mdash;   Whenever a government these days proposes and/or passes a law that seems weird, intrusive, invasive, or destined for DumbLaws.com, there is usually a silent racial motivation, an end-run attempt to do something about black or Hispanic crime without actually saying so.  If the opposition to this bill was strong among Tennessee&rsquo;s black Democrats in the state legislature, then there&rsquo;s the leading indicator.  I think the touch that sort of gives it away is &#8220;social networking.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Every time I see a photo of a sexy woman, it causes me severe emotional distress.  This happens on an average perhaps 20 times a day, and every time I go to Fox News in the morning.  Can someone direct me to the 800 number or wherever so that I can get my millions due to being traumatized by these images that will not give me peace?</p>

		<p>I would hope that this one get quashed at the state or federal supreme court level. It is too vague and opens up the attorneys full-employment act of Tennessee. How do you enforce this if somebody posts something on Facebook in Kansas and the offended party is in Tennessee? Is the governor of Tennessee going to order the Kansas State Patrol to bring this scofflaw in? The KSP will respond to a warrant out of Tennessee for a felony charge, but shouldn&rsquo;t be bothering because somebody in Nashville got their feelings hurt by someone in Lenexa. </p>
<p>What if the Chiefs whip the Titans in KC and the scoreboard flashes something &#8220;offensive&#8221; that can be seen by anyone in Tennessee (or the nation) watching the game on TV, IPAD, laptop, Iphone, etc? Do you go after CBS or FOX and every service provider too? If the Tennessee National Guard is in Afghanistan or Iraq, could a member also sue even though he is not physically in Tennessee? I&rsquo;m sure that the Judge Advocate General Corps division that handles wills, powers of attorney, and other legal matters over in tent 23-A wants to open up this can of worms. What if people walk into LP field wearing gear from the other team? Is an off duty Police Officer suddenly going to become offended and slam Matt Cassel&rsquo;s Mom to the ground? (I believe she is White and therefore wouldn&rsquo;t invite a federal lawsuit against said officer). </p>
<p>I would think that Tennessee has more pressing matters than &#8220;Disturbing Images&#8221;. Just take a walk around Memphis. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no way such a law could be enforced.  It&rsquo;s way too broad, as emails are sent all over the world, and the rest of the world isn&rsquo;t governed by TN law.  If that one ever goes to an appellate court, and it will, it&rsquo;ll be struck down.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t Haslam only a generation removed from New England?  I know his father was part of the Pilot Gas Station and truck stop fortune.  I never really trusted him because hew as part of MAIG while Knoxville Mayor.  He was the most liberal of the three major Republicans running for Governor last year (incidentally, I favored Wamp).  I still say he&rsquo;ll push for an income tax.  Mark me.</p>

The government can get access to &ldquo;images or communications&rdquo; posted to a social networking site by offering &ldquo;specific and articulable facts,&rdquo; suggesting that the information sought is &ldquo;relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which essentially means that in order to build a case, they have to build a case.  i.e.  They -cannot- make a single point judgment of the image or text (sext) in hand.  They -must- act on the belief that you are &#8216;habituated&rsquo; and thus give themselves an argument that they have to snoop before presenting evidence of the need for a warrant for &#8216;greater freedom of electronic snooping&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Talk about horses and carts.</p>
<p>The way to handle this is:  Have a thousand person student body at a high school choose a selection of images (swastikas, horror film stills, whatever) and post them on Facebook.</p>
<p>Then do it again and again and again until they &#8216;get caught&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Then have their parents disown them to avoid paying their minor child&rsquo;s criminal fees.  And dare the Tennessee government to put them all under social services care.</p>
<p>Such would expose the hypocrisy of the government which sought proof of continuing crime by monitoring a -supposed- crime without doing anything to stop it.</p>
<p>There is such a thing as preventative law enforcement.  And then there is witch hunting.</p>
<p>This can only edge towards abuse of power from a needless opening position (because if it was serious like child prostituion or pornography there are already laws on the books to handle rapid electronic surveillance warrant issues).</p>
<p>I myself don&rsquo;t believe it has thing-1 to do with black and hispanic (flash mob/wilding etc.) crime because the cops already have an ability to intercept text and open-network server systems in their cruisers and so the easiest way to handle the issue would be to make those networks which you wanted open access to _free_.  As every library network I log onto MUST SAY: &#8220;Any information over this unsecured network subject to monitoring, do you want to log on anyway?  Y/N.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics are cheap. Even if they use dialectic spanish, ebonics or some other form of &#8216;code&rsquo; a large enough sample size will give you the cryptographic breakin.</p>
<p>Because it is &#8216;offensive material&rsquo; based, this is far more sinister.  And thus certain to be aimed at whites.</p>

		<p>I want to see Gov. Bill Haslem along with any legislator that had anything to so with this insanity fined and imprisoned or both. They should also lose their jobs and be shunned from society for they have caused more &#8220;emotional distress&#8221; than any image posted by a web-site on the internet. I &#8220;am extremely emotionally distressed and upset&#8221; that our supposed leaders have spit in the face of America and our citizens by imposing their mean spirited, Marxist ideals on a free nation. This is America!  and Bill Haslen and his cronies need to find a country that likes dictators. How an idiot like Haslen gets to be Gov. is way beyond me. I guess George Soros money has far reaching tentacles. One can only hope that &#8220;Spooky Dude will run out of money by the next election.    </p>

		<p>I am not that surprised over this vote. Haslam was hand picked by the country club Nashville kingmakers just like the rest of the RINOs in high office around in these parts. The Memphis Tea Party is PATHETIC, doing little more than rubber stamping establishment NeoCons rather than drafting conservative candidates. </p>

		<p>Can someone tell me why Tennessee, of all places, would enact such a dumb and dangerous law?  I thought the Volunteer State consisted heavily of Albion&rsquo;s Fourth Seed, the Outer Celtic Protestants whose ancestors came here during the 18th and early 19th centuries.  So why have legislators there enacted a law that makes it easier for blacks and Hispanics to make life miserable for whites and make a bundle in civil &#8220;damages?&#8221;</p>
