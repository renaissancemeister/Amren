			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aricka Flowers, Progress Illinois, May 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some members of the Asian-American and Latino communities are taking issue with the proposed redistricting map that could be approved as early as today in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Chicago&rsquo;s burgeoning Chinatown neighborhood should be in one congressional district, rather than fractured into three separate federal voting districts. That&rsquo;s the consensus of a coalition of Asian-American organizations that are calling on the Illinois General Assembly to &#8220;fine tune&#8221; the state&rsquo;s new map of congressional districts.</p>
<p>But the group, the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community (CBCAC), may be up against tall odds since a vote on the political map could come as early as today. {snip}</p>
<p>C.W. Chan, the Asian group&rsquo;s [Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community (CBCAC)] chairman, said the political map  &mdash;  made public last week  &mdash;  flies in the face of &#8220;well over a year of hard work including discussions, advocacy, and public testimony emphasizing the need for the community to be kept intact at all levels in the redistricting process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chan said the CBCAC considers this new development to be a setback in its effort to gain fair voting rights for residents of Chinatown; home to about 30,000 people  &mdash;  a 50 percent increase from a decade ago, according to federal census data. That data also shows the Asian population in Illinois grew by 38.6 percent, the fastest rate among minority groups in Illinois.</p>
<p>The new map, like the former map, has Chinatown divided between U.S. Reps., Danny Davis (7th), Daniel Lipinski (3rd), and Luis V. Gutierrez (4th).</p>
<p>CBCAC is a project of eight major service organizations in the community. Their mission is to empower Chinese American communities in Greater Chicago through organizing, civic participation, education, and coalition building. {snip}</p>

		<p>When it gets to the point that mongolians, chechens, bengalis and bhutanese all want their own voting districts, does anyone, anywhere seriously believe there will be a U.S.A. anymore?</p>
<p>Very soon our nation will be a fragmented collection of ethnic fiefdoms at war with each other, either hotly or coldly, and whites will be poor, starving refugees pushed around by the powerful chinese warlords, black gang-kingdoms, latino jefes and - well, you get the point.  </p>
<p>The sad thing is that liberal whites want just such a future for their descendants.  Enough of them have been quoted as saying things like they hate the white race, they can&rsquo;t wait &#8216;til we&rsquo;re out of power, we&rsquo;re a &#8216;cancer&rsquo; on human history, etc.  </p>

		<p>Unopposed, the Chinese invaders are carving out semi-autonomous colonies inside America.</p>
<p>This happened in Malaysia.  For centuries the Chinese migrated there, displacing the indigenous Malays. With sufficient numbers, the Chinese in Malaysia now maintain their own language, schools, culture and political structure, claiming immutable rights of &#8216;historic presence&rsquo;. </p>
<p>If this continues, future generations of Chinese in America will expect not only ethnic identification with territory, but also ethnic representation in Washington, with access to military and strategic secrets.</p>
<p>They are conquering us without us even acknowledging it.</p>

		<p>Our so-called &#8220;model&#8221; citizens (Chinese and Asian-Americans) want in on the action to &#8220;empower&#8221; their race, just like the blacks and mexicans do.</p>
<p>So where does that leave us White folk? Where are our race based organizations? Where is our empowerment committees?  We are the low man on the totem pole in our own country and not a peep from our White politicians or &#8220;leaders&#8221;..</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand why anybody considers Asians a model minority anymore, especially after the recent incident at UCLA.  They whine just like other nonwhites do, obviously.  Is anyone on here aware that May is designated as &#8220;Asian/ Pacific Islander Heritage Month&#8221;?  I had to hear all about it at work recently. An email was sent around listing all the steps taken in recent years to help Asian American businesses.  The only people  discriminated against in this country are whites.  Enough said. End of discussion.  Asians are just like the rest of them. </p>

<p>This is diversity making us stronger?</p>
<p>Nothing could illustrate the failure of multicultural socities better than the above headline.</p>
<p>We are in the depths of the situation Roosevelt warned us about regarding multiculturalism making this country into a giant boarding house of contentious, bickering people.</p>
<p>As the economy continues its slide to the bottom, this situation will continue to get far worse.</p>
<p>Even mainstream Obama supporters are talking depression right now or they describe it euphemistically as a &#8220;double-dip.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see anyone arguing that this is racist, segregation, or discriminatory. The reporter doesn&rsquo;t question any of this but reports on this move as if it&rsquo;s acceptable and &#8216;empowering&rsquo;. Which it is; for minorities. </p>

		<p>LOL. The Asian community isn&rsquo;t getting any representation in Chicago.</p>
<p>Chicago is all about &#8220;the blacks&#8221; and &#8220;the hispanics&#8221;.<br>
Detroit we are zooming for your status and with high-speed rail connecting us someday, we will be able to more quickly trade thugs (and the women they are pimping). <br>

If whites are the minority in the big blackened yellowed reddened cities they must get fair and equal representation too.  </p>

		<p>I agree!  Why not, it can be called &#8220;Separate Development&#8221; or Apartheid.  After all it is the sensible way to go (tongue in cheek).  Have the same for African Americans and all groupings as they wish, etc.  It will make a better guarantee for a peaceful future and all can support themselves financially and prove they can do it.</p>

<p>The future of the U.S. is being shaped by unelected elites who would like to see nationalism broken apart.  The more a country is full of bickering ethnic solitudes, the less resistance there will be to the whims of the powerful shareholders.</p>
<p>If this comes to pass, the U.S. will exist only as a world trading bazaar, effectively owned and run by feudal billionaires in gated communities.</p>

		<p>@15  &mdash;  B J Deller,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
I agree! Why not, it can be called &ldquo;Separate Development&rdquo; or Apartheid.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Because so long as we are tied together by the slenderest thread, anything whites do to -exclusively- achieve success in our lives which does not reflect equally across the unequal black, hispanic and asian cultural as genetic divides will be seen as somehow prejudicial.</p>
<p>i.e.  It will be taken away from us the same way as it was in South Africa when the protective separation of whites from black townships ended in 1994.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
After all it is the sensible way to go (tongue in cheek). Have the same for African Americans and all groupings as they wish, etc. It will make a better guarantee for a peaceful future and all can support themselves financially and prove they can do it.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Politicians will never yield power.  They will alway do whatever they can to generate intergroup dependencies that they can &#8216;moderate&rsquo; (suck cash from).  Politicians are the accomodator personalities of our culture.  They have no real ideas of their own so they betray us to other interests: political, cultural or economic, that they may profit from the gains of having to fix a problem which they themselves have created.</p>
<p>This will never change so long as whites foolishly believe they have truly &#8216;representative&rsquo; participation in the running of the national government in Washington.</p>
<p>We must shift, privately, into coaligned, contiguous (across state borders) ethno enclaves which have gathered together the fundamentals of education, technology, agriculture and industry necessary to create independent nation after separation.</p>
<p>And then actually, physically, remove ourselves from the failed state that the USA is about to become.  Only when we have the choice bits of midwest under our thumbs and absolutely no allegiances to the foul proclamations coming out of the former America&rsquo;s capital will we be able to create a government and society based upon inclusiveness for no one but the white indigene groups which are the founder population of the original country.</p>
<p>AT THAT POINT, it will be up to us to succeed or fail.  Which is what whites have _always_ wanted, exclusively, for ourselves.  Not pity.  Not glory.  Not respsonsibility for others problems.  Just our own lives and the freedom to live them the way we see fit.</p>

<p>Either you create minority districts or you end up white-majority districts where minorities hold the balance of power. The end result of having minority districts is having white districts. Unless you intend to do away with the foundational idea of &#8220;one man, one vote&#8221; you have to have minority districts if you want white districts.</p>
<p>The idea of dividing up a neighborhood like Chinatown in Chicago is a little depraved. The intent behind it has to be to deprive Chinese residents of any concentrated political influence. If you had, for example, a Polish neighborhood and it was carved up as described, most Amren reader would see the situation for what it is.</p>
