<h1><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2011/06/21/gore-promoting-fewer-children-to-curb-pollution/">Gore Promoting Fewer Children to Curb Pollution</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Poor, The Daily Caller, June 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an appearance Monday in New York City, former Vice President Al Gore, prominently known for his climate change activism, took on the subject of population size and the role of society in controlling it to reduce pollution.</p>
<p>He offered some ideas about what might be done for females in the name of stabilizing population growth. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we could do about it is to change the technologies, to put out less of this pollution, to stabilize the population, and one of the principle ways of doing that is to empower and educate girls and women,&#8221; Gore said. &#8220;You have to have ubiquitous availability of fertility management so women can choose how many children have, the spacing of the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to lift child survival rates so that parents feel comfortable having small families and most important  &mdash;  you have to educate girls and empower women,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&rsquo;s the most powerful leveraging factor, and when that happens, then the population begins to stabilize and societies begin to make better choices and more balanced choices.&#8221;</p>

		<p>To preach this message to industrialized nations is as useless as telling a Major League pitcher to get hitters out.  Unless, of course, this message is preached to third-worlders in industrialized nations.  This message would be more useful (or less useless) if explicitly directed at the third world.  Looking at the original article, Gore wasn&rsquo;t directing his message in any specific direction.</p>
<p>Of course, I quite doubt the vast majority of third worlders, in their home countries or in industrialized ones, care much about the environment.  Given their penchant to largely recreate their homelands, they&rsquo;d likely believe the generally cooler temps of Western nations are simply too cold for them.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to see Gore actually take this effort and preach to the people who are actually responsible for the population explosion   &mdash;   Non-whites.  You can count the number of seconds on one hand that he keeps caring about overpopulation once someone starts screaming racism.</p>
<p>No, what Gore means here is that us white people are screwing up the world by having &#8220;too many&#8221; children.</p>

		<p>For all you ecologists out there:  The worst thing you can do for the planet is move someone from the Third World, where they have a very low ecological footprint (i.e., use very little energy and non-renewable natural resources) and move them to a First-World country, where they will have a large ecological footprint.   </p>
<p>Everyone expects new immigrant to start consuming   &mdash;   house, TV, computer, water, electricity, gas, heating oil, car, etc.  In my community, they even give &#8220;energy grants&#8221; so that the recent immigrants can heat their houses in the winter and cool them in the summer.  If the immigrants don&rsquo;t start consuming, then all the liberals are wringing their hands at how racist Whites are &#8220;holding them back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leftists will tell you to do without to &#8220;save the Earth&#8221; while at the same time doing their best to destroy the ecology of the West by pushing to import tens of millions more people. </p>
<p>The movement of hundreds of millions of Third Worlders into the First World over the last 50 years (and their resulting children), is a prime reason causing increased consumption of resources.  </p>

		<p>Margaret Sanger would be proud.  He isn&rsquo;t saying anything new, liberals look at the &#8220;masses&#8221; as worthy and unworthy, the unworthy (poor, irresponsible, having too many children, attached to the government by way of needing services).  The next thing I would guess from the government will be forced abortions.  The way we are demonizing corporations and saying that they are not paying their fair share, but it is ok that the government takes from us, we are really in for it.  We need to look at government as what it is &hellip;a necessary evil.  It has grown too large and the local governments have also added to this problem by not solving their own problems and keep going to the federal government for help.  Kind of remind me of slavery.  We are the slaves, states are slaves and the federal government is the slave master. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a Canard, this idea that all good things come by empowering and uplifting women. Women across the globe are already socially esteemed, or protected and placed on a higher plane than men. Fertility in the west has fallen far below replacement levels due to vilifying legislating against men? </p>

		<p>8 Anonymous:</p>
<p>The environmentalist left always complain about the high average energy consumption of citizens of the Western world.  I happen to think that it&rsquo;s non-whites in the Western world, both domestic and imported, that are driving it.</p>
<p>I had a landlord who rented to black tenants tell me one time that almost all of his black tenants liked to keep their thermostats very high in the winter.  Even if they could pay their gas bills themselves, (often, there are government subsidies), it would still hurt the average white energy-conscious consumer because the accumulative demand from these black energy hogs means that the natural gas utility has to purchase more natural gas on the open market, and in a tight supply market, like the one we recently had, that means much higher rates for everyone, including the old white senior citizens on fixed incomes who should set their thermostats at 70 but can only afford 65.</p>
<p>Now, this is not the only example.  But notice the average black ghetto thug isn&rsquo;t driving a Hybrid Prius or a Smart Car, much less keeping the gas hogs they do own in good enough shape in order to maximize their own fuel economy.  That all adds up   &mdash;   A MPG here, an MPG there, pretty soon it starts adding up to real waste and a higher price for you and me at the pump.</p>

<p>I wonder if mass immigration to the West decreases the pressure in these overpopulated third world countries (as opposed to West nation - many of which are overpopulated already themselves). That is, the birthrate is higher in these nations in the first place because we let so many of them immigrate. </p>

		<p>No, the answer is quite simple; stop giving them free food. This explosion in the world population is due to free western food and medicine, distributed by both government and traitorous &#8216;charities&rsquo;. Let them shift entirely for themselves for two generations and we will see an appropriate and entirely natural readjustment of the global population. </p>
<p>They want us &#8216;evil, colonial oppressors&rsquo; out of &#8216;their nations&rsquo;? I for one and more than happy to oblige -and pull the plug on every bit of western aid they recieve. Meawhile, I want the rest of their third world populace to get out of my soverign nation and go sleep in the bed that they made for themselves. </p>

<p>And at the same time, New York&rsquo;s Mayor Bloomberg is encouraging the importation of  endless streams of ever more immigrants!!</p>
<p>Basically, it boils down to more immigrants and fewer Americans. Can anything be plainer that we are being replaced? Or (at the very least) that our ruling &#8220;elites&#8221; could not care less?</p>

		<p>I remember back in the late 60s and early 70s environmentalists told us we had to lower our birthrates to stabilize the population.  Well, glory be, white people did that.  Even black American birth rates went down significantly, although they are always higher than the white rate.  And indeed, had we kept immigration at the levels of the 1950s and early 60s our population would have stabilized by now, at well under 300 million.</p>
<p>But starting in the 1970s immigration levels went through the roof.  And immigrants have higher birth rates than native born Americans.  So now our population shows no likelihood of stabilizing within the next century.  Who favors this immigration policy?  The current board of directors of the Sierra Club, among others.  Apparently population growth isn&rsquo;t a problem for the environment so long as it&rsquo;s non-white people doing it.  Years ago when Al Gore was running for President he was asked by Craig Nelson of Project USA if he would reduce immigration.  He said no, we need &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, go to hell, Al Gore.<br>

		<p>Watch for him to work with Christian churches promoting adoption of African orphans. Why not have white couples adopt African children rather than have their own white children? Under God we&rsquo;re all equal anyway. Gore would be going along well used channels of co-operation between Christian churches and the anti-racism movement, but with ecology added into the mix. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;the subject of population size and the role of society in controlling it&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is nothing new. I remember being in high school in the early &#8216;70&rsquo;s with teachers earnestly drilling it into us (white middle class teenagers every one of us) that we MUST limit ourselves to two children per couple, or preferably less, to prevent disastrous overpopulation of the entire world.  Having some contact with most of my former classmates down through the intervening 37 years, it is clear that most of us DID have 0, 1 or 2 children. WE aren&rsquo;t the ones overpopulating the Earth&hellip;. I am as guilty as the rest, having only contributed 2 children myself.<br>
White people have already self-limited themselves to producing the tiny number of children they can reasonably hope to support  &mdash;  considering the crushing burden of feeding, housing, educating and providing free medical and other care to endless hordes of others through social programs.<br>
Given freedom from onerous taxation for social programs, most white families could easily and happily raise 4 or 5 successful children even on ONE income.</p>

<p>Unless you CHANGE PUBLIC POLICY.</p>
<p>In the 1920&rsquo;s, the construct of forced sterilization and eugenics directed SPECIFICALLY at non-Whites were where WHITE SCIENTISTS, CLERGY (including, at one point, the Archbishop of Canterbury), and POLITICIANS were located.</p>
<p>Madison Grant, Lothrop Stoddard, et al. were in the forefront of Public Opinion, and the 1924 Immigration Act was a DIRECT RESULT of this here in the USA.</p>
<p>What changed public opinion? The BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION, and the importation of that &#8216;foreign element&rsquo; in Russia, to these United States. Then, armed with lots of dollars from the &#8216;International Bankers,&rsquo; These same &#8216;Others&rsquo; set about brainwashing and destroying the ethnic homogeneity of the USA. It only took them seventy years.</p>
<p>The names may change, but the ideology is still the same. It is Antichrist. Too bad the &#8216;main dream&rsquo; [sic] Churches didn&rsquo;t stand up to it; but merely capitulated to &#8216;another gospel.&rsquo; Instead of instituting &#8216;hispanic&rsquo; parishes, one communion could have stood up for her Irish, French, and German communicants who built the entire edifice of their Church here in the USA&hellip; but no. It would appear that Christendom is a passe idea, once one can claim &#8216;universal jurisdiction.&rsquo; Misericordie, Domine.<br>

Al Gore and Ted Turner both have 5 kids each and multiple homes, they drive multiple cars, boats, fly around in private jets, and waste more money EACH than my entire neighborhood.  It&rsquo;s just absolutely gross.  In addition, they live in mansions or in gated communities which promotes an idealistic, utopian viewpoint about multiculturalism which is very far from the reality that we middle class whites experience daily &#8220;in the trenches,&#8221; so to speak.  First of all, these hypocrites should take a long hard look in the mirror before they open their mouths to let loose what I consider absolute drivel.  </p>

		<p>If Al Gore actually believes this is true&hellip;.he should be the first to insist on border (and interior) inforcement to REMOVE the illegal aliens that have invaded our country, very much adding to the pollution and very much gobbling up our precious water, and housing, and parking, and tax dollars.</p>
<p>Yes, Al Gore has showed us the way. Too bad he is not going in that dicrection too.<br>

That would be great for our people. Have you ever gone to an all white event (for me it&rsquo;s the fourth of July fireworks). It was soothing wallowing in all the beautiful whiteness. Just sit back and soak it all in. This is how it should be. It&rsquo;s our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweden, a socialist state, is an example of a white nation that has had a baby boom in the past ten years.  And I mean a native Swedish baby boom.  Dog eat dog capitalism would not have allowed this to occur.  The Swedish model, sans immigrants/asylum is the ultimate white model, as also is Norway.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t the World be a much better place if Al Gores parents had followed this one very simple rule?</p>
<p>Of course if Al hadn&rsquo;t been born we wouldn&rsquo;t have the INTERNET he claims credit for?</p>
