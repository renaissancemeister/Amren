<h1>When a News Story Omits Race, Do We Really Know Any Less?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Schmich, Chicago Tribune, June 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>You probably know the basic facts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A dozen or so teenage males went on the prowl near North Michigan Avenue in Chicago&rsquo;s toniest shopping district. They attacked five people, ages 20 to 68. Their loot included a backpack, a wallet, a bike, an iPad, a BlackBerry and an iPod Touch. The cops quickly arrested five alleged assailants, at least three of them from the South Side, and vowed to find the rest.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve followed the story  &mdash;  and who hasn&rsquo;t?  &mdash;  there&rsquo;s another fact that you also know, but it&rsquo;s one you haven&rsquo;t read in the Tribune or seen explicitly stated by most of the official media: The young men were black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So why would a news organization avoid a fact? This fact?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ambivalent about the omission of the attackers&rsquo; race in the news accounts, but I think I would have decided to leave it out too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the quandary, for editors, for cops, for all of us:</p>
<p>Race alone doesn&rsquo;t predict or explain behavior. Just because this mob was young and black hardly means that all young, black people in groups are a violent mob. Knowing the race of these attackers is no form of protection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So, yes, the attackers were black. We notice. But how to measure the relevance of the fact?</p>
<p>As my friend pointed out, recalling the words of the African-American writer Toni Morrison, &#8220;Once we know the race, what else do we know?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer? Not as much as any single word  &mdash;  black, white, other  &mdash;  may make us think we do.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s the wrong way to look at it, even if it is true.  The better way to look at it is not that most young black men are ever part of violent mobs, but that most violent mobs consist almost entirely of young black men.</p>

		<p>&hellip;But they sure as hell don&rsquo;t have a problem mentioning the race if the perpetrator(s) are/is Caucasian. </p>
<p>I mean,even if it&rsquo;s an Arab or Hispanic, they will get labeled &#8220;white&#8221; if they do something wrong.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t mention blacks by their race, they are such a &#8220;fragile&#8221; and docile people that mere mention of their race in these instances will puncture their self-esteem.</p>
<p>Poor blacks! BooHoo! I think I am going to cry a river now!  </p>

		<p>Is there any wonder why more and more people are going to the internet for their news?  They&rsquo;re tired of having their intelligence insulted by these reporters who tell us that the race of the perpetrator is irrelevant.  Heck, the only reason I go to newspaper websites is just to read the comments section (which are becoming more and more like Amren boards).</p>

		<p>&#8220;So why would a news organization avoid a fact [that the perpetrators were black]?</p>
<p>Reporting that fact would amount to &#8220;stereotype confirmation.&#8221;  And if American media have any objective it is to avoid confirming stereotype about black youths, particularly black youth in groups.  The stereotype is that they are impulsive, violent, capable instant mayhem.  Who can forget Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s immortal words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery. Then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved. After all we have been through. Just to think we can&rsquo;t walk down our own streets, how humiliating.&rdquo;  (Jesse Jackson, November, 1993)</p>
<p>If the rampaging Chicago youths were white, that fact would be heavily reported, as it would be a stereotype &#8220;disconfirming&#8221; fact. Likewise, the stereotype disconfirming &#8220;fact&#8221; that three white Duke university students raped a black female intoxicated American media such as the New York Times as well as a large segment of the Duke faculty and the NAACP.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why stereotype disconfirming facts will be heavily reported, even when not true, and stereotype confirming facts will be ignored or worse.</p>

<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t. Not 100% of the time. But in my area you can count on the perp of a violent crime USUALLY being a young black male.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing the race of these attackers is no form of protection.&#8221; </p>
<p>Not for people like myself and others who post here. We already know of the aggressive, violent tendencies of blacks. Its those who don&rsquo;t pay attention, or those who believe the idiocy that the mainstream media dishes out on a daily basis that could be helped greatly if the media would only be honest when reporting on violent crime. Blacks have to find victims somewhere. And its sure not people like those who post on AmRen. </p>

		<p>By making the claim that the race of the perpetrators is not indicative of all people of that race, she needs to go a step further and say that their age and gender is not indicative of all ages and genders in that group.  Additionally, the location of the crime becomes unnecessary as well since that particular spot isn&rsquo;t always the scene of a crime.  </p>
<p>She might as well say that every news story (save for ones where the fugitives are at large), should read &#8220;Somebody did something somewhere.&#8221;  Better yet, report nothing.</p>
<p>Of course, us reasonable people know that&rsquo;s a bunch of nonsense and realize that all facts (especially race) are very pertinent to the story. </p>

If a crime is committed, the community has a right to be informed so they can take action to protect themselves and aid in the capture of the suspect.</p>
<p>If race is excluded, why is gender not? </p>
<p>You never read, &#8220;A person was attacked by an unknown person&#8221;. The gender is always included. For example, &#8220;a 20-year-old male was attacked by an unknown male&#8221;. </p>
<p>News reports always include the gender of the suspect. Why is gender considered relevant when race is not? Likewise, the age and build of the suspect is often included as is the clothing they were wearing at the time of the attack (which I consider odd because clothing can quickly and easily be changed and discarded while the race of the suspect can&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>We all know why this is done; because the majority of violent crime is committed by blacks (and increasingly Hispanics). Blacks know this and demand the suppression of facts in the vain hope that no one will make the connection between the blacks and the high levels of violent crime they commit.<br>
    <br>
A couple years ago, the Buffalo News ran a front page story about a series of seven rapes (and attempts). However, they didn&rsquo;t report this story UNTIL the seventh attack when they finally reported the story and included the fact that the suspect was black.</p>
<p>What this means is that six other women were unaware of the potential to be raped by a black man in this neighborhood because the Buffalo News didn&rsquo;t report the first incident and give a full description including the race of the suspect. </p>
<p>If I was one of the women attacked after the first attack and I learned that the Buffalo News didn&rsquo;t report the first attack, I would have hired a lawyer to see if the Buffalo News could be held culpable for suppressing information relevant my safety and well being.</p>

<p> If it was an all white group doing this the media would be splashing it all over the front page of every newspaper, magazine, radio, television and internet site literally screaming their color. The coverage would be wall to wall, 24 hours per day seven days per week for months. Every concievable angle would be covered. The Justice Department would charge the group with so many crimes they couldn&rsquo;nt try them in a lifetime.<br>

		<p>Interesting piece, more for what it doesn&rsquo;t say than what it does (do click through and read the whole thing). </p>
<p>The writer describes a &#8220;conundrum&#8221; of whether to include race in the story. Nonsense. Race is a reportable fact, something that was once grasped by the people who used to call themselves &#8220;reporters.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the attitude that our media somehow needs to manage race relations by omitting what everyone knows. So who are they really doing this in service of. I think their names are Dvonte, Trovolus and Derodte.</p>

		<p>What maddeningly blind PC drivel.</p>
<p>Writer Toni Morrison said, &ldquo;Once we know the race, what else do we know?&rdquo; Well Toni, I know that when you were asked what you thought of black women having children out of wedlock, you responded that they should give their children to you, so that you could nourish and love them. You were never called on that canard, forced to adopt black America&rsquo;s unwanted babies, or made to eat your words in that instance, so why not keep plodding on. </p>
<p>To answer your question, though, what do we know once we know the race? A hell of a lot.</p>

		<p> Typical agonized, White liberal hand-wringing: &#8220;Oh, my goodness, if we identify them as black, nasty old White racists will post hateful comments, and the vast majority of black kids who are good, moral kids who treat their mommas right, will be tarred with the same brush!&#8221;</p>
<p> The news media should be in the business of disseminating the news   &mdash;   all of it, minus things like the names of juveniles arrested, the names of alleged rape victims, and the like. Nothing is gained in this nation of &#8220;diversity&#8221; (read: polyglotism) by pretending that race doesn&rsquo;t matter, and deliberately leaving it out. Tell us the race of all perps   &mdash;   black, White, or red all over. Then let the accumulation of facts speak for itself. &#8220;Racial stereotypes&#8221; is often just liberal-speak for &#8220;inconvenient, uncomfortable facts.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If you look really carefully, you will notice that in San Francisco, blacks from the Fillmore housing projects sometimes target whites and others in the North Beach area of the city late  at night.One of their victims was a white who was forced into a van, and beaten so severely that he suffered severe brain damage.The politically correct news media, as usual, covers up any racial factor in these incidents.  m I the only individual who notices this, or is there even one other?</p>

<p>We know that if there are instances similar to the one being reported, we are reading about probable hate attacks, and, if knowing that to this Morrison seems insignificant, then she&rsquo;s only saying that because she doesn&rsquo;t have to be concerned about being a victim.  Nor is she concerned about out-of-control black crime, because she perceives it as a way of gaining leverage for black causes.</p>
<p>This story is slanted in the same way all worthless drivel excusing black crime and criminals is portrayed by leftist radicals in the media.</p>

		<p>Stanford educated Ms.Schmich teaches us that race alone does not predict behavior. Thomas Jefferson had a different opinion:</p>
<p>&#8220;They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection.&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, Jefferson&rsquo;s observations reflect reality much more closely than Ms. Schmich&rsquo;s do. Jefferson&rsquo;s observations explain the high rates of illegitimate children, drug use, violence, and crime. The rates of these behaviors are very predictable, even if Ms. Schmich teaches us otherwise. As traditional controls go away, these rates will increase. And then there will come the call, which we are just now beginning to hear, for &lsquo;order&rsquo;. Also from Jefferson:</p>
<p>&#8220;They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome. But this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Their excuse holds up, albeit just barely, until you notice one thing. Okay, so the race of a busted thug is irrelevant in a newspaper story so it is omitted.  Ok&hellip; I got it, don&rsquo;t buy that reason, but I got it.</p>
<p>But if that is true&hellip; What about when the suspect is still at large and the description of the suspect is given without race? That renders the description useless and thus unnecessary, yet the description is still printed.  Why is this so, Mr. Editor?  Logic would have it that a description without a race would only make sense in an homogeneous society.  Logic dictates that in a multi-racial society descriptions that give racial information become more important when the suspect is still at large.  These descriptions are printed in hopes of catching the criminal or finding witnesses to the crime.  If they weren&rsquo;t they wouldn&rsquo;t provide the exact height and weight, clothing, or hair color of the suspect; I mean according to the logic that editor removes unnecessary information.    </p>
<p>I see another logic prevailing here; one that says you have an agenda to push.  I mean there is only a library&rsquo;s worth of history of media manipulation to pursue an agenda. Right?  </p>
<p>No, nothing to see here, boys.  Just keep on walking.</p>

		<p>Some in the black community seem to imply that since crime is prevelant in their own neighborhoods, that the rest of us should &#8220;get used to it&#8221; as if we all should just accept deviant behavior as a way of life.</p>
<p>That is not acceptable! Thuggery is thuggery and should be dealt with harshly wherever it occurs. The &#8220;stop snitching&#8221; and &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; mantras may play well south of 35th Street, but that&rsquo;s not how the rest of us choose to live.</p>

		<p>The author misses the obvious fact that race is very predictive of violent behavior.  Ok let&rsquo;s not mention race at all when reporting crime.  Fine.  It&rsquo;s the left that&rsquo;s foisted &#8220;diversity&#8221; on us which makes EVERYTHING about race.  They should at least fess up to the bad behavior that race identity brings.  The left nurtures this resentment toward whites and now they&rsquo;re getting their dividend of hate.  Yes, identify it in the news!</p>

		<p>The simple fact is that when a criminal act is committed by a white or Asian the race of the suspect is always mentioned.</p>
<p>When a similar transgression is committed by a black or blacks, it&rsquo;s nearly always omitted.  This doesn&rsquo;t make the news item any less informative, since the public long ago noted this omission.<br>
And even if they didn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s practically universally known in this country that blacks commit the overwhelming majority of crimes, particularly violent crimes.</p>
<p>When traveling in black areas I&rsquo;m extremely observant of blacks near me.  In white areas I pay no attention to the people around me.  I would assume that the majority of whites do likewise. </p>

A hardshell conservationist who would preserve species and races, I can not go &#8220;to church&#8221; with them to hear of the sacred slaughter of Amalekite, Jebusite and &#8216;Maphrodite before the pagan &#8220;abomination,&#8221; nor to learn  that the latest manifestation of African zeal in Chicago is but an illusion.  No amount of transfer payments may relieve those who live in intellectual squalor and that is where Ms. Schmich and the Bible thumpers at whom she would chuckle reside.

<p>the fact that this is implicitly known by everyone hearing about the story, yet never mentioned in any of the stories, is evidence of multiple problems. the fact that this hack glosses over this point- which is really the whole story- is further evidence.</p>
<p>this column is proof positive of the much higher criminality of blacks and the fact that the media willingly, deliberately covers it up. that someone whose supposed job is to convey objective truth can be so cavalier with admitting he and his ilk deliberately obscure the truth would be hilarious if it weren&rsquo;t so very sad.</p>

<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re white, we know that they&rsquo;re racist and should apologize for existing, or, as I like to say, the crime of &#8220;living while white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, white people are ultimately responsible for black crime as well (because of racism and white privilege, e.g. the privilege of working 80 hours a week), so maybe the newspapers, instead of reporting &#8220;a mob of 50 black youths&#8221; could just report &#8220;a mob of 50 young victims of white racism.&#8221; That would pretty much clarify everything.</p>

Remarks [by Jesse Jackson] at a meeting of Operation PUSH in Chicago (27 November 1993). Quoted in &#8220;Crime: New Frontier - Jesse Jackson Calls It Top Civil-Rights Issue&#8221; by Mary A.

		<p>Dunno how long it will last but I just posted this-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
We are the frontline of crime.</p>
<p>Black Males, 14-44, represent 3-4% of our population yet form 36% of our prison population.  They are 7X more likely to commit violent crime &amp; 8X more likely to commit property crime than whites.  They are responsible for 30-35,000 rapes of white women per year (whites go multiple years without assaulting -any- black women) &amp; are responsible for 52% of this nation&rsquo;s murders.  Blacks have a 20% higher serum testosterone level &amp; an average 15 point/1MSD (100 vs. 85) lower IQ compared to whites.</p>
<p>Poverty /=/ Low IQ or High Criminality.  East Asian immigrants, being genetically smarter than whites, need less than one generation to advance in society.</p>
<p>If one group shows a higher propensity for crime (high testosterone reduces impulse control in ALL races) at the same time a lower biologic intelligence limits their SES mobility (you have to be smart to benefit from social cohesion); pretending this is a social problem &#8216;that has nothing to do with genes&rsquo; after 300 years of blacks living in Western society is _absurd_.  It denies us the chance to marshal our genomic sciences to a medical resolution.</p>
<p>And why would a cognitive elite, safe in their gated communities, want to raise overall IQ to a self-competitive 120 collegiate level if they can bandaid the plague of undiscussible racial crime &amp; retain a subject population of junk consumer ditch diggers?<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>And the Tribune forum actually took it.  Here&rsquo;s a thumbs up for journalistic integrity.</p>
<p>And here is why Mz. Schmich is wrong-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Race alone doesn&rsquo;t predict or explain behavior. Just because this mob was young and black hardly means that all young, black people in groups are a violent mob. Knowing the race of these attackers is no form of protection.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Perhaps.  But race certainly predicts job fulfillment where SES satisfaction in life status has an R=.72 correlation with intelligence and blacks still retain a 1MSD &#8216;achievement gap&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you are not rich because you are not smart (and let&rsquo;s face it is getting ever more difficult for even smart whites to get by in this ever more sophisticated society) you are less likely to see the rationale behind loyalty to &#8216;the system&rsquo; of social rewards for hard work as applying to you.</p>
<p>That -is- racial and applied across generations, genetics dictate the environment by which blacks suffer in squallor far more than environment dictates their genetics.</p>
<p>If you are not the lead dog on the sled team _because your genome doesn&rsquo;t have pathfinder material_, your view never changes.  And that is not the fault of those who do have the right stuff&hellip;</p>
<p>We must be able to discuss this, openly.</p>

		<p>Now, wasn&rsquo;t it Jesse Jackson who expressed great relief when he realized that the group of young men tailing him on foot one dark night WEREN&rsquo;T BLACK????   If a group of young black men is out of control, wreaking mayhem, even one of the blacks&rsquo; icons (JJ) tells us to fear those young black males MORE than we&rsquo;d fear whites, Hispanics, or any other race.  So I don&rsquo;t know who this broad is kidding; young black ghetto males are vicious, dangerous, and to be avoided at all costs.  Just ask Jesse Jackson!!!</p>

		<p>News reporting used to be unbiased and objective. Not any more. It&rsquo;s used now more for sensationalism and/or to push a dangerous agenda.</p>
<p>Take the story above. Reporting this news item should be used first and foremost to inform the public for their safety. And informing the public means a description of the perpetrators - race is a description. If I lived or worked around the North Michigan Avenue area of Chicago I&rsquo;d like to know what the teenagers looked like who were committing these assaults so I would know who to watch out for - basic common sense. I would also want to know the severity of the &#8220;attacks&#8221;. You can tell that main stream media (MSM) is down playing the crimes when they will not even use the word assaults, but substitute the lesser word attacks.</p>
<p>The MSM does us all a disservice when, to quote Mary Schmich, &#8220;Race alone doesn&rsquo;t predict or explain behavior&#8221;. The public KNOWS this. For MSM to assume the role of civics teacher is utterly unnecessary - we&rsquo;re intelligent enough to know better. So either MSM assumes we are all bigoted morons, which is extremely insulting and untrue, or they are pushing their own agenda at the expense of peoples safety, which is inexcusable. MSM has sacrificed common sense for what they feel is politically correct, thereby jeopardizing everybodies safety, making their agenda stupid and dangerous.</p>
<p>To quote Schmich again: &#8220;Knowing the race of these attackers is no form of protection&#8221;. Oh yes it is Mary! Talk about stupid and dangerous - to the extreme.</p>
<p>And then MSM wonders why they are losing readers and viewers daily? Because daily they insult and endanger us.</p>

		<p>I have been told many times that most black criminals prey on blacks, and that most white crime victims are the victims of white criminals.</p>
<p>I have been robbed at gun point once, and mugged more times than I care to admit. My brother and sister have been robbed at gun point. I have friends who have been mugged. Every single time blacks did it.<br>
 <br>
I am sure there are a few blacks who have been mugged by whites. You probably could fit every one of them in my apartment, and still have room for a few bearded ladies, and a man with two heads. </p>

		<p>My initial impression upon reading the headline was that &#8220;at least this writer was willing to broach the topic,&#8221; but alas, the article turned out to be disingenuous to the point of nausea. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so disingenuous, like most liberal rationalizations about race: Whenever black problems are discussed, this pretense of not wanting to make overgeneralizations goes out the door, and invariably, whites and white &#8220;racism&#8221; are blamed for black problems. </p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t make generalizations about black behavior but we can make generalizations about their cause, that is, white &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, notice how stupid liberals think the general public is. We are incapable of making fine distinctions about group behavior and realize that, while blacks are far more prone to violent behavior, this does not mean that any individual black is violent. Liberals really do have a contempt for the general public&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>

I believe what we&rsquo;re seeing is a crack in PC wall.</p>
<p>The media has been hiding the race of suspects for years. This is becoming increasingly obvious to white people who are now literally under attack.</p>
<p>The tactic the writer is using is interesting. Notice that this woman doesn&rsquo;t resort to calling people racists and bigots. It&rsquo;s almost as if she knows it&rsquo;s not going to work so she&rsquo;s employing a fresh spin.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to convince people that race doesn&rsquo;t matter. &#8216;So what IF all the teens WERE black? What does it matter? It doesn&rsquo;t! QED!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The media can&rsquo;t hide the facts any longer. White people are seeing the truth about media lies and black crime. </p>

		<p>Actually I agree with the article. There is no reason to include the race anymore because we already know which race. Especially if they dont mention it. By not mentioning race they just told me the race. And if they call them &#8220;youths&#8221; then its slam dunk over but that is not really needed anymore. When ever I read &#8220;mob&#8221;, &#8220;riot&#8221;, &#8220;pack&#8221; I already know and so do most.

		<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s attended a journalism class lately knows that &#8216;social justice activism&rsquo; has been woven into the contemporary curriculum.</p>
<p>The premise of journalistic activism holds that news reporting should be used to offset perceived negative portrayals of non-whites. In order to avoid maintaining negative stereotypes, race should not be reported at all.</p>
<p>This is coming straight from the mouths of some prof&rsquo;s, and is taking root in editorial policy.</p>

		<p>For some reasons newspaper reports always make a big deal about giving the age of any controversial person in the news, it&rsquo;s always the second thing you read after the person&rsquo;s age.<br>
  So a person&rsquo;s age, for some reason, is &#8216;more relevant&rsquo; to the news than a person&rsquo;s race.<br>
  Anyway, the self-imposed censorship of the press (for that&rsquo;s exactly what it is), imposed by the newspapers compares to the news manipulation that characterized the former Soviet bloc.</p>

		<p>The omitting of race in crime reports is getting to be an ongoing joke in Australia.  </p>
<p>I feel it is really important to report race. For instance with the influx of Indian migrants in Australia, there has been a massive spike in sexual assaults committed by Indians on Australian women. </p>
<p>People need to know that they may not be as safe around certain ethnic groups because these groups have racist stereotypes about them. For instance the favourite stereotype from third worlders, sex being like a handshake for Caucasian women. </p>
<p>There is a double standard being played out that the Indian community doesn&rsquo;t want to be mentioned as responsible in the media reports about these sexual assaults because they don&rsquo;t want to be stereotyped because it will endanger the safety of the members of their community, but an absolute denial of the human rights of Caucasian women.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to be stereotyped but I bet they don&rsquo;t do much to combat the appalling stereotypes of Caucasian women in their own community.  </p>

<p>This is patently false.  If you park your car in a somewhat deserted area and you see several young blacks nearby, and instead of getting out of the car you drive away, there is a very high probability that you have just saved yuorself a beating and a robbery.  Knowing the race of these individuals was a very valuable &#8220;form of protection&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s rephrase the question as follows:</p>
<p>what would the US be like today if the media, politicians, etc., had been brutally honest about the reality of black crime rates over the past 50 years or so??</p>
<p>Here are some possible answers:</p>
<p>whites would be more savvy about avoiding explosions of black on white violence. </p>
<p>The US would be even more segregated, but a heck of a lot safer for whites. </p>
<p>We might have developed rational policies by now for dealing with the breathtakingly, staggeringly, high levels of black violence, crime and dysfunction in America.</p>
<p>For some reason, the topic of race makes people incredibly stupid (including the waffling writer of the above article).</p>
<p>If almost 40% of Japanese American males were dangerous felons, people would avoid them like the plague, with good reason.</p>
<p>If close to 0% of black Americans were dangerous felons, no one would be afraid of them - just like no one is afraid of Japanese Americans.</p>
<p>All of which should be obvious to a bright nine-year-old.</p>

		<p>Needing to live in New York City several years ago, I had to check out possible neighborhoods in which my lower-middle class income could permit me to find some place relatively safe. I wound up in an Asian neighborhood in Queens, in large part because I thought to myself, &#8220;When&rsquo;s the last time you heard about an Asian mugger?&#8221;</p>
<p>To pretend that upscale whites don&rsquo;t consider the racial makeup of a neighborhood, despite all their talk about equality and all, is not true. The problem is that Black youth are now targeting the liberal, wealthier neighborhoods. For example, when the Rodney King riots broke out in Los Angeles (in 1992 as I recall)the Blacks talked about going &#8220;to torch the three B&rsquo;s (Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Brentwood)It now looks like out of control &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; are entering such neighboroods in big cities at will to wreak havoc, without waiting for a full scale riot like they did in the past.</p>

This is how ignorant some blacks are. I was reading an internet article on a black interest website one day about a crime that took place amongst some local gang over a shooting over drugs. Imagine that. Well, the writer spun the tone of the article towards not reporting to the police if any of the readers know anything about the shooter. </p>
<p>The moron writer said for the bystanders to keep all the info to themselves without sharing w/ law enforcement, because the &#8220;cops have their own code of silence&#8221; called the&#8221;Blue Wall&#8221;. Oh, well that explains everything! Now it&rsquo;s fair, right?</p>

		<p>My daughter has a classmate that is 1/4 Japanese. This girl and my daughter are good friends. She was one of a few girls over the other night for a birthday party. Her grandfather was stationed in Japan with the Navy back in the 1950&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m sure that for reporting purposes, she is placed in the &#8220;multiracial&#8221; or Asian category. I can think of one Asian boy at my kids school; the other 4 or 5 are girls adopted from China. In the &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; mentality of the MSM, I should be quaking in my boots whenever I see the grandmother. As far as I know, both the mother and grandmother of my daughter&rsquo;s classmate have never &#8220;been in the system&#8221;. We&rsquo;re all aware of those attacks led by groups of Japanese grandmothers masquerading as black teenagers.  </p>
<p>Contrast that with the news blaring from the idiot box nightly concerning the inner city of the nearby major metropolitan area and there is good reason I avoid that area at night. Even though I cringe at some of these names that my peers give their children (Aidan, Braden, Cayden, and so on), some of the really oddball names that blacks give their children are a Godsend. </p>
<p>Unless the parents name the kid Michael, James, or something fairly normal, you almost know instinctively that they are black. Even the Asian kids at my daughter&rsquo;s school all have normal names. Granted most were changed from something like Xiong Zhang to Olivia Randolph. The black parents who were procreating when I was born had the foresight to give junior a normal name. However, almost to a person, they came up with the screwiest middle names. I guess they just couldn&rsquo;t contain themselves. Walter Edwards doesn&rsquo;t necessarily specify race (I know a couple of White guys named Walter), but Walter DeoVante Edwards is a dead ringer. </p>

Black: 2,468 per 100,000</p>

Exactly. I read once of a town that was inundated by swarms of deadly fer de lance snakes after a volcanic eruption. News reports didn&rsquo;t include the statement, &#8220;There is no reason to think that the fer de lance attacks have been species motivated.&#8221; </p>
<p>The concern was that the fer de lances were swarming and were biting people, not whether they were motivated by hate or were just being fer de lances.</p>
<p>The volcano of racial integration is erupting, and we are beginning to be swarmed by a danger that we are not accustomed to having among us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If I was one of the women attacked after the first attack and I learned that the Buffalo News didn&rsquo;t report the first attack, I would have hired a lawyer to see if the Buffalo News could be held culpable for suppressing information relevant my safety and well being.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, yes, the attackers were black. We notice. But how to measure the relevance of the fact?&#8221;</p>

As a reporter, it&rsquo;s your JOB to report the facts. It is NOT your job to &#8220;measure the relevance of the fact.&#8221; That&rsquo;s for sociologists and politicians   &mdash;   and also your READERS   &mdash;   to do. </p>
<p>So, Ms. Smich, you may stop wringing your moisturized and manicured pale-skinned hands over this, as I have solved for you your moral dilemma. Just tell your readers the facts, and leave the measurement of their relevance to others. </p>

<p>No, &#8220;we&#8221; don&rsquo;t know which race.

<p>Therefore, it is up to YOU and all of us to Spread the Word to our White children and loved ones that blacks are to be avoided whenever possible, are violent, will attack without provocation.  I take no chances around blacks; no White should.</p>
<p>It may save their lives.  Take a hint from the hispanic gangs in Azuza; there is a very good reason why they&rsquo;re ethnically cleansing blacks out of their neighborhoods   &mdash;   and it&rsquo;s not all due to drug rivalries, it is about protecting their loved ones from black violence.</p>

<p><i>The Arizona Republic (-12.30 percent), the Cleveland Plain Dealer (-11.24 percent), the Los Angeles Times (-11.05 percent), the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times (-10.70 percent), the San Diego Union Tribune (-10.05 percent), the Chicago Tribune (-9.72 percent), the Detroit Free-Press (-9.56 percent) and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (-9.50 percent) also lost significant print circulation, ABC reports.</i></p>
<p>The papers claim they are losing readership to the Internet but I don&rsquo;t believe it.  Whites are sick and tired of the White-hating, marxist messages the msm continue to blast.  As wat tyler writes: <i> It is about time for whitey to strike back economically.</i></p>

If Charles Murray, Professor J. Philippe Rushton, and others had written and published their books during the 1940s the Brown v Board decision of 1954 would have substantiated school segregation. The civil rights legislation of the 1960s would not have been signed. <br>

This would be unfortunate for the minority of blacks who are able to perform and behave as well as whites. It would be fortunate for whites. The crime rate would be much lower.

<p>Well, she knows where her bread is buttered, no doubt.</p>
<p>If I were attacked by a wilding group of people, all of whom were 7 feet fall, bald, and barefoot,  would that mean something?   If You were attacked by a group of one-eyed midgets, every one  of them with flaming red hair and no front teeth, would that - just perhaps -  mean something?  Would that physical description not  be worth reporting? Or would it be prejudicial?</p>
<p>She might supercilliously ask: &#8220;What&rsquo;s their appearance got to do with anything?&#8221;   Well, obviously it would seem to have something to do with something!  It would mean, for whatever strange reason, that people in that area would be wise to be wary of mobs of red-haired midgets with no front teeth, or groups of bald seven-footers who are barefoot.</p>
<p>This is a silly analogy, I admit, but no less silly than her lame excusal of mobs of violent young blacks who time after time have proven their criminal proclivities. Blindness to that fact is sheer idiocy.</p>

		<p>Just require the police to provide a detailed description including race and other distinguishing features. Require that Crime Alerts (like Amber Alerts) are flashed over social media and all media outlets online and on the air. Any individual in a media outlet that fails to report the full-description will be prosecuting for obstruction of justice, as would any police officer who fails to file an accurate report. We can even charge them with being an accessory after the fact. We need to play hardball people. Make our enemies squirm. </p>

<p>Steven, that you identify these crimes as being committed solely or largely by whites only goes to show that you do see these criminals identified as white. Clearly you have made the connection.</p>
<p>However, you&rsquo;re missing the point of the article. It&rsquo;s about identifying unknown suspects.</p>
<p>If a group of black teens attack a man sitting on a park bench and the black teens get away, the media should identify the criminals as black teens because it aids in their capture and is a warning to the public. If the suspect are on the lam, they should be identified.</p>
<p>The examples you cite about serial killers and bank fraud don&rsquo;t follow this pattern unless the suspect is identified and at large. That&rsquo;s why when a white man attempts to molest a child, the suspect is identified as white. The same thing should apply to identifying black suspects.</p>
<p>BTW, there are plenty of black serial killers. Just do a google search and you will find them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a youtube video from 2008 which needs to be updated:</p>

		<p>Steven, Steven. Typical liberal nonsense rebuttal. First of all, when you stated &#8220;white pedophiles, white child molesters.&#8221; That is the same label. You are only repeating yourself to add to a list that fits your narrative. Look up Lindsey Bruce Columbus, Ohio. Black pedophile who raped, murdered &amp; decapitated 5 year old White female. Emily Rimel. It sickens me to no end that I ever have to bring up that story.</p>
<p>And by the way Stevey, by population %, Whites should have a huge criminal lead for &#8220;sexual predation&#8221;, but blacks are not far behind on this. Many blacks who are incarcerated for non-sex related crimes actually have a sexual predator label on them from somewhere in their past. So spare me that blacks aren&rsquo;t pedophiles. Moron.</p>

		<p>Anon 73 - the newspapers were reporting the sexual assaults by Indians and then the nationality was reported less and less.  </p>
<p>They may be by Indian Muslims but the main stream media doesn&rsquo;t drill down that far in reporting this, which is my point. If one group is prone to sexually assaulting women more than others then people do need to be aware of it. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where you are located but it has been a noticeable problem where I am living. We are all aware that it is happening and the silence is deafening. </p>

		<p>Failing to mention race in such a context as in this kind of street crime ultimately leads me to think cognitive dissonance is at work here. In other words, mind control through techniques which disturb the mental processes of listeners to the extent that a message which subverts the actual logically obvious message prevails.<br>
A la Goebbels.<br>
Where in Nazi Germany it should have been clear a totalitarian age was in the offing, many thought it wouldn&rsquo;t become that way because Hitler&rsquo;s propaganda insidiously portrayed the killings in the asylums and the lebensborn lunacy as acceptable, so we in the USA are told to think that the not-at-all obscure racial hatred component of much street crime is not what it is; rather it is &#8220;random.&#8221;<br>
So don&rsquo;t get alarmed and don&rsquo;t draw conclusions. Especially conclusions of the type that family breakdown amidst government welfare programs are not at all connected. And that once a family is broken it doesn&rsquo;t regenerate; that once entropy wins order doesn&rsquo;t re-establish itself without outside effort.<br>

		<p><em>I&rsquo;m happy the press doesn&rsquo;t mention the race of criminals when reporting.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that for one minute.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;d get pretty tired of hearing about all the:<br>
<ol><br>
  <li> white child molesters</li><br>
  <li>white serial killers</li><br>
  <li>white pedophiles</li><br>
  <li>white bank fraud, etc</li><br>
</ol></em></p>
<p>Taking each by turn, 1.) Something that registers as pathological behaviour in a given society or culture tends to be more easily detected. 2). Just take a look at some of the suppressed and heavily played-down cases that only appear on the internet. 3). Please see point 1). Please also bear in mind that in a society where the age of majority is a prerequisite for marriage (one man to one woman, not &#8216;playing the field&rsquo; with a raft of sponging babbymammas), rather than a shuck &#8216;n&rsquo; jive free for all feel-good catastrophy such crimes are recognised as such, rather than being considered the &#8216;norm&rsquo;. 3). Please refer to public administration in many major cities that have been indelibly stained by corruption; Bank fraud can be seen more as a crime of opportunity in this context than anything else. If you can&rsquo;t get in, then you can&rsquo;t cheat and steal your way to a small fortune.</p>
<p>When it comes to crime generally, if there is no viable framework of normative behaviour to follow, then clearly such instances of behaviour may never be recognised as &#8216;criminal&rsquo; at all. Just look at the post-hoc excuses and justifications that are wheeled out for the sorts of pathological behaviour that the media do their utmost to suppress.</p>
