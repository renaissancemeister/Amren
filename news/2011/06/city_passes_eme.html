<h1>City Passes Emergency Curfew in Wake of Brutal Five Points Beating</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WISTV (Columbia), June 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Columbia City Council has enacted an emergency curfew in the wake of the beating of an 18-year-old man last week in Five Points. Meanwhile, the teenage victim of the brutal attack is speaking out for the first time.</p>
<p>Council members unanimously passed an ordinance during a special work session Tuesday morning making in against the law for anyone under the age of 17 to be out in the Five Points area between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.</p>
<p>The curfew lasts 60 days and goes into effect immediately. It will be enforced every day of the week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>19-year-old Thyeem Henrey and seven juveniles are being held in the June 20 beating of Carter Strange. Police say he was jogging home just after midnight when the suspects approached him and beat him up. According to family members, Strange had to have emergency brain surgery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carter says he recently talked to the man who found him and called 911. &#8220;I told him how much I appreciate what he did, because otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t be here right now,&#8221; said Carter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carter doesn&rsquo;t have medical insurance, so his family has set up an account. You can go to any Wachovia and Wells Fargo bank and donate money.</p>

		<p><i>Carter doesn&rsquo;t have medical insurance, so his family has set up an account.</i></p>
<p>South Carolina might have a crime victims compensation fund, largely funded by the cash netted in drug busts and other drug bust assets later sold at auction.  Odds are they could pay his medical bills.  Even if Carter did have insurance, the insurance company would ask for this fund to recompense them anyway.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this &#8220;emergency&#8221; curfew is only temporary and only applies to U-17.  At least one of the assailants was at least 17, and as we know, blacks can be plenty criminal even when they reach 17 years old.</p>

		<p>I hate to say this but you have to be an idiot to jog in Columbia South Carolina after midnight. </p>
<p>I was only in Columbia once in my life and that was enough. I was in Basic training a Fort Jackson and then had to stay for a couple extra months of school at that stink hole. Happiest day of my life was when I got on the bus to leave there. It was bad even back in the early 1970&rsquo;s. If you went downtown alone it was very easy to get hit over the head and robbed and they even came on post robbing people. One guy was robbed and killed.</p>
<p>We went in a group of five one night thinking that would be safe but end up being chased by a group of about 20-25 blacks. </p>
<p>I have nothing good to say about Columbia. I wouldn&rsquo;t live there anymore than I would downtown Atlanta. I may have to visit or work there but I&rsquo;m not going to live there. </p>
<p>I would never have been in Columbia unarmed except for the fact that the Army took my knife away and said it was a danger weapon and wouldn&rsquo;t let me own a private firearm.  Actually safer in Vietnam because there you could shoot back. </p>

		<p>*He says he tries not to think about what happened to him, and he&rsquo;s not even mad at the people who attacked him.<br>
However, Strange said he does have one question. &#8220;I might ask them why they did it, but I don&rsquo;t even know if they have a reason behind doing it,&#8221; said Strange.</p>
<p>I was feeling sorry for him before I read these statements. A pack of black thugs almost beat him to death, but yet he&rsquo;s not &#8220;mad at them&#8221; and has NO IDEA why they did it! The stupidity of Whites like him just amazes me! Trust me, if a pack of Whites attacted a lone black, they WOULD be mad and they would know exactly why they did it. I suppose his next move will be to meet with his attackers to tell them that he &#8220;forgives&#8221; them and to ask how he can help them. If Mr. Strange doesn&rsquo;t change his mindset and start getting mad, then I definity see an Amy Biehl award in his future. <br>

		<p>This is only article that actually give facts of stoked tensions-<br>
turns out, racial tensions are just mean comments left on websites.   No marching, no shouting, no demands, no picketing, just comments on websites- that should really be frightening and a big threat to social order.</p>
<p></p>
<p>https://goo.gl/AKLbu</p>
<p>The victim is white. The eight alleged perpetrators are black. And that opened the lid on some racial tensions in the Capital City. </p>
<p>The State newspaper closed the comments section on a story about the incident, citing abusive comments. The Free Times Rant &amp; Rave line filled with messages calling the beating a hate crime. On a Facebook page called &ldquo;Justice for Carter Strange&rdquo; are posted not just prayers but posts calling the attackers &ldquo;animals&rdquo; and demanding they be imprisoned for life.</p>
<p>Police accounts of the incident contain no indication that the victim was targeted because of his race  &mdash;  the definition of a hate crime.  <br>

<p><br>
Or maybe just brainwashed.  Whites, particularly young whites, are so steeped in pc that it overrides their innate power to think.</p>
<p>Taxi drivers are told they must always pick up passengers no matter what their instincts tell them.  </p>
<p>People are told that when they walk down the street they must use the same amount of awareness and caution when being approached by an 80 year-old white woman or a gang of 20 black &#8220;youths.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Older people see thru this nonsense, but young white people often adhere to the nonsense.</p>

		<p>Well that&rsquo;s equality, black youths involved in an unprovoked attack on a white and youths of all colors get to share in the penalty.  <br>
Any wonder why white flight is a common phenomena   &mdash;   black crime and the inability of the police and newspapers to deal with it.  Make that white, Asian, Hispanic and even Jamaican flight from Afro-American communities.  </p>

		<p>Until white people really wake up, and demand:</p>
<p>1. regular, public, mass hangings;<br>
2. nationwide &#8216;concealed carry&rsquo;;<br>
3. deportation of all illegals;<br>
4. the right to live once more in all-white communities &hellip;</p>
<p>life is going to just keep getting worse and worse for us - forever.</p>
<p>What is truly frightening is that this is happening at a time when record numbers of criminals are locked up, thanks to three strikes laws (which liberals are constantly challenging). </p>
<p>The only realistic hope for whites is for us to band together in communities of the like-minded, and do all we can subtly but with force to keep those communities as white as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, if whites would just wake up,we could solve all problems. But there is something genetically flawed about whites. Those of us who are awake are likely to remain a minority until there are too few whites left to re-civilize the nation.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s white, they&rsquo;re black.  That&rsquo;s all the reason they needed.</p>

		<p>How did this happen in SC?  I thougt Southerners were safe from black mob violence because they are so heavily armed?  Every time something like this happens in a Northern state, people here say this could never happen in the South.  Well what do you have to say now?  </p>
