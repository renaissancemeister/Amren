		<p>All three were black, there was a pic on the news. </p>
<p>Did they steal Colt 45 or Heineken? </p>
<p>They already had records for other crimes.</p>
<p>I wonder if the white woman will be charged with a hate crime?  </p>
<p>As the woman says, the blacks were laughing.  I have noticed that myself.  They seem to think crime is a joke. </p>

		<p>At first, it&rsquo;s a great story, but then the reality sinks in.  One of our own exposed herself to injury or death just to stop blacks from acting all black in here.</p>
<p>The potential benefit wasn&rsquo;t worth the most likely cost.  She got lucky, so let&rsquo;s hope she got it out of her system and will never walk into a Walmart again.</p>
<p>Look for the NAACP sue her for drawing attention to black criminals.  The only time Whites are allowed to interact with black criminals is when we are receiving a justified robbing, raping, or murdering form the Integration and Civil Rights Diversities.<br>

		<p>Did you see that white police car ram the &#8220;poor, oppressed minority&#8221; into the fence?</p>
<p>I yelled so loudly that I&rsquo;m now cowering in my apartment awaiting a summons from the management company for causing a noise disturbance.  If I feel completely masochistic, I&rsquo;ll show them the cause of my exuberant (racist) outburst of White Rightness. The will earn their anti racist bona fides by condemning me with an eviction notice. &#8220;We will not tolerate prejudice from our residents!&#8221;</p>
<p>I can easily get out of any retribution by groveling and apologizing and starting a petition drive that Walmart stop making its videos available to the internet because they are used in &#8220;unfortunate ways that only serve to incite vile and outdated stereotypes against the beloved community of color by reflecting poorly upon our most vulnerable and needful and enriching and valuable and vibrant diversity&#8221;.<br>

		<p>We need more people like this heroic woman. We must all be alert and ready to act in the new America, especially if you are interested in sustaining your family, friends, community and quality of life. It is the quality of life in modern America which is diminishing right before our eyes. This Lady of Texas acted absolutely correct and in her and our best interest. She defended and guarded her values, her families values, her communities values and the values of her culture. She stood up and said ENOUGH!  When will you confront your &#8220;enough&#8221; moment?  I tip my hat to the Lady for her brave nobility.</p>

		<p>I can understand the sentiment. She could have gotten killed, though, were the thieves armed. If she got badly hurt would Wal-Mart or anyone else have been there for her while she recuperated, helped her with lost wages, medical bills, etc?   Don&rsquo;t mean to discourage spontaneous action on the part of citizens but she seems to have taken some chances there. </p>

		<p>That is actually a very stupid thing to do.  She could have been killed over a case of beer.  That isn&rsquo;t the way to stop crime.</p>
<p>She should have simply recorded the license plate number.   In a well functioning neighborhood, that is what happens.  Witnesses call in to police with tips.</p>
<p>But due to the chaos of integration, you have diminishing common sense. </p>
<p>Crime might be impossible to stop under the current climate.  Mixed neighborhoods with a heavily black population will have the most crime and the least amount of common sense.  That is because norms are broken down.  Culture breaks down.  Unity breaks down. Crime goes up, and tips to police is viewed as snitching.  Everything gets turned upside down.</p>

<p>As a white person, I do not intend to go to prison, unless I am framed for a crime I did not commit.</p>
<p>As if going to prison for breaking the law, the high risk of prison rape most likely by black inmates, being confined and missing out on so many things I like to do in the free world, were not bad enough, the consequences of being released into society as a convicted felon seem to do more to motivate me to stay on the right side of the law.</p>
<p>If after serving a prison sentence, or being getting a suspended sentence, upon being made a convicted felon, it would put me in a portable prison.</p>
<p>As a convicted felon, I would not be able to practice such professions as law, medicine, or banking.  But even jobs I could legally do would be extremely difficult to find with a criminal record.</p>
<p>I would not be able to vote, hold public office, or own any kind of firearm.  I would not be able to visit such countries as Canada or Great Britain.</p>
<p>Of course, to black, hispanic, and even low-life white habitual criminals, would such consequences even matter to them!?</p>
<p>It is this disgrace to honor that would be even more terrible for me than going to prison itself.  I wonder could it be that in my previous lifetimes I was a native Japanese, and maybe in another lifetime that I was a Scottish Highlander?  These are the kinds of people who traditionally value honor more than anything else!</p>

		<p>I commend her courage; however it was very foolhardy.  To risk her life like that over a case or two of beer at a Walmart?!  I could see her jumping on their car if they had taken her child or baby, but a case of beer?!  She&rsquo;s lucky she jumped on the car instead of gotten in front of it or they surely would have run her over and thought nothing about killing a White woman.  I&rsquo;m still confused about the video of the car pinning the guy against the fence?  Does anyone know who that was?  Was it one of the thieves?</p>

		<p> This woman should get a community award for her courage, and her refusal to be intimidated by this trash. Would that more White men showed half as much courage as she did.</p>
<p> My only regret about the only thing is that she wasn&rsquo;t packing heat, so she could give those three what they deserved, right there on the spot.</p>

If these thugs were in Saudi Arabia they would not be laughing!<br>
They would be contemplating the rest of their lives with only one hand.<br>
The Saudis have no humor for crime and would not put up with this stuff for an instant.<br>
I would not want us to copy them, but this goes to show that we can learn something from every culture.</p>

<p>I suggest you read up on European history regarding the Chivalric tradition.  You&rsquo;ll find it interesting.  It turns out that pre-Christian Vikings had the strictest codes of honor.  Your word was literally your oath, and there was no forgiveness if you broke it.  Likely, this is one reason why Northern Europeans have been the cultural source of  world wide business stability, including American.  If you look at the faces of those folks who caused the latest trouble, there are less Northern European, &#8220;Blue eyed white men,&#8221; (as Brazil&rsquo;s president called them) than there used to be.  It is likely as genetic as cultural.  </p>

		<p>While this gesture appeals to the old-school &#8220;law and order&#8221; crowd at face value, what she did was as foolish as it will ultimately be meaningless, or at least forgotton in a matter of days. Black criminals play for keeps, and it is a wonder she got away alive. Is stolen beer from Wal-Mart(a grand celebrator of &#8220;Diversity&#8221;) really worth your life? </p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the world many of us grew up in the 50&rsquo;s,60&rsquo;s, or 70&rsquo;s. These feral predators think NOTHING of killing for gain, or just for sport! And this woman is obviously NOT racially aware, or she would have known to steer clear of this situation by a country mile!</p>
<p>Making yourself a martyr for &#8220;right and wrong&#8221; in this day and age is an empty gesture. Save your strength and efforts for bigger battles than this, my White brothers and sisters.   </p>

		<p>I just hope that the woman doesn&rsquo;t suffer any retribution from the two Mau Mau because they won&rsquo;t serve any REAL jail time unless the cops add on leaving the scene of a crime and resisting arrest. Her name is out there and that&rsquo;s what worries me. Then again we&rsquo;re talking Texas, one of the few states that still seems to have a set of &#8220;coglioni&#8221;.</p>

		<p>What was with all the &#8220;men&#8221; standing around doing nothing through this whole situation?  Good for you girl!  And all you bloggers saying what she did was useless and endangering to her self, shame on you.  Ya, these thugs now know who she is, but everyone knows who they are too.  They should be the ones worrying.  I gotta tell ya, and a lot of you might not like hearing this, but if White males don&rsquo;t start bucking up and fighting back, we are in serious trouble and will have nobody to blame but ourselves.  This situation brings to mind an incident not too long ago when sweet little Taylor Swift was getting a music award and some black thug, I forget his name, ran up and took the microphone away from her to rank about how his black sister should have won instead.  There wasn&rsquo;t one big White bubba in the whole place who got up and knocked that &#8220;jackass&#8221; (Obama&rsquo;s word) off the stage.  Not one White man stepped up to defend this White girl who was being deprived of a golden moment in her life by this thug.</p>

		<p>No, the lady wasn&rsquo;t necessarily stupid, she was acting according to principle. Yes, on one hand, she may have gotten hurt, yes it was only a case of beer.  The point is, however, by principle, she acted, even though she put herself at risk. Acting on principle, as opposed to pleasure, is one of those &#8220;higher&#8221; traits that only intelligent, morally upright, people value.

<p>I sincerely hope her male relatives/friends can look out for her interests until she backs gusto with capability.  This applies also to her children.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to lose brave white wombs to stupid black retribution.  And yes, anyone who thinks beer is worth a felony rap is beyond ignorant.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind when you think righteous confrontation = step down in the face of ethnic crime.  It doesn&rsquo;t.  They simply don&rsquo;t care.</p>

		<p>I admire the womens&rsquo; courage, but there is no way in hell I would risk my personal safety for Walmart. Does anybody think Walmart could care less about this lady? Would Walmart have paid her medical bills - or her funeral costs - if this had ended badly? Walmart has gutted countless main streets in small town USA. It is a huge trader with China and is not a buy American company at all. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t lift a finger for Walmart. Now maybe if it was a privately owned store and I was friends with the owner. But for Walmart? No way!</p>

		<p>Great courage.  I would like to know what the woman thinks of &#8220;Die-versity&#8221;. </p>
<p>Odd that there is no statement from the BBKs at Walmart.  One thing for sure they will not appreciate her action. </p>
<p>I recall an incident in a Florida Walmart some years back where a granny pulled a gun and threatened to shoot a black criminal (BC).  A store manager had caught the BC shoplifting and a fight ensued. </p>
<p>I think real damage was about to be done to the hapless manager when granny put a pistol to the BC&rsquo;s head.  Well the outrageous part, as well as I can remember, was that the Walmart BBKs either threatened or actually took legal action against her.</p>
<p>In our local Walmart about five years ago a BC simply picked up a TV and walked out. Nobody would or could stop him.  The cops investigated of course but&hellip;..I doubt much happened.</p>
<p>Once in a while BCs make mistakes.  Again at our local Walmart recently two BCs attempted to rob an illegal Mexican on the parking lot.  Trouble was about half of Michoacan was in the nearby nursery buying plants for their landscaping business.  They came out and swarmed over the BCs leaving them cut and bleeding on the pavement. </p>
<p>I quit going to Walmart because of their support for Die-versity.  The last straw was an advertisement for women&rsquo;s baby slings in which all the women were pretty and white. In the featured slings these women all carried little black kids.  </p>
<p>I wrote to the CEO of Walmart and sent him my cut-up credit cards. I told him how disgusted I was with his baby sling ad. I&rsquo;m sure that this fool expressed shock at my reaction and chalked it up to some &#8220;cracka raycist&#8221;.</p>
<p>I also forbid any of my employees to do company buying at Walmart. </p>
<p>I salute the woman but I would risk nothing for Walmart.  If a white person&rsquo;s life is in danger it&rsquo;s another story.  Protect Walmart&rsquo;s property? Screw them. </p>
<p>Yes I know, today Walmart, the next day they&rsquo;ll rob your house. But Walmart asks for this.  They think it better not to offend blacks than to risk a Jacksonian type boycott.  A little lose of merchandise here and there is likely treated as a business cost. </p>

		<p>That lady is reckless, brave, decent and very lucky to be alive after a brush with these thugs. Maybe a tip of the now melting iceberg of white tolerance to this kind of blatant anarchy and lawlessness by (majorities)-In many States is starting to ferment. It is telling that this obviously decent white female American is prepared to go to these risks and lengths to stop them, then perhaps there is hope for us yet?

		<p>1/ She seemed to show suprise they were laughing. 2/ She actually expected  them to stop. So she either hasnt much experience of these peoples ways or she&rsquo;s been brainwashed in some &#8216;Diversity is Strength&rsquo; school of tolerant thinking.</p>
<p> Btw, even in England habitual shoplifters  are usually posted on a mugshot  list (and they&rsquo;re nearly always black or of immigrant stock too) and not allowed into that shop  again.</p>
<p>That accent of hers  btw, is it Southern?  </p>

No, the lady wasn&rsquo;t necessarily stupid, she was acting according to principle. Yes, on one hand, she may have gotten hurt, yes it was only a case of beer. The point is, however, by principle, she acted, even though she put herself at risk. Acting on principle, as opposed to pleasure, is one of those &ldquo;higher&rdquo; traits that only intelligent, morally upright, people value. I have the utmost respect and admiration for this woman.<br>

As do I. Someone else posted on here that she is not racially aware or she wouldn&rsquo;t have risked her life for her principles against a car full of feral black thugs.  No, I suppose she isn&rsquo;t QUITE aware yet, but she sure knows what color the criminals were, and so will all of her friends, relatives and acquaintances. Her actions will start to awaken a whole group of formerly unaware people. There should be a whole lot more people acting the same way, and with each small,single action, decent morality grows; thugs and thieves become increasingly less brazen as they begin to face a white public who refuses to pretend they don&rsquo;t see it, and more people awaken to the racial reality. It&rsquo;s like a grass fire. It grows  &mdash;  or it could  &mdash;  from each brave or even impulsive action like hers. </p>

		<p>I also noticed the thugs parked where all d-bags park at WalMart&hellip;right up by the curb, to the side of the doors.  Those lots are always crowded, so people who don&rsquo;t respect civilized society&rsquo;s &#8220;code&#8221; tend to feel they deserve a better deal than all the rest.  If they haven&rsquo;t been shifty enough to coax a doctor into signing for a fraudulent disabled parking ID, or haven&rsquo;t STOLEN a disabled parking ID yet, they simply pull up near the curb and go in to shop, or, in this case, to rob the place.  My guess is these creeps park there even when they don&rsquo;t need a fast getaway!</p>

		<p>White backlash, oh yes.  How come we spent so much time studying grammar, articulation, elocution, and sentence diagramming, spelling, and other areas of our efforts?  Blacks are living proof it is unnecessary to be accomplished in any of these issues.  And our government pays these people to be stupid and exist&hellip;.<br>
No excuse for massive ineptitude and ignorance. None.  To blacks who are accomplished, God Bless, live long and prosper.</p>

<p>Not noticeably so.</p>
<p>This article does not say WHERE in Texas it happened.   <br>
Large Texas cities are full of newcomers from elsewhere.</p>
