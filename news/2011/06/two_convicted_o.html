<h1><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bailey-20110610,0,7516858.story">Two Convicted of Murder in Shooting of Oakland Journalist</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lee Romney, Los Angeles Times, June 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A jury Thursday convicted two men of first-degree murder in the slaying of Oakland Post editor Chauncey Bailey, who was gunned down on a downtown street in broad daylight nearly four years ago in an effort to thwart his investigation into the finances of a business run by one of the defendants.</p>
<p>Yusuf Bey IV, 25, was convicted of ordering the murder of the 57-year-old Bailey, the first U.S. journalist killed over a domestic story since Don Bolles of the Arizona Republic died in a car bombing in 1976.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bey IV was running Oakland&rsquo;s Your Black Muslim Bakery, a once-prominent Bay Area institution founded by his father that gave jobs to former prisoners. The confessed triggerman in Bailey&rsquo;s death was bakery handyman Devaughndre Brousard.</p>
<p>The jury Thursday also convicted Antoine Mackey, 25, on first-degree murder charges for killing Wills and helping Broussard kill Bailey. {snip}</p>
<p>Deputy Dist. Atty. Melissa Krum said she was pleased with the verdict, adding: &#8220;To not just kill a local reporter but to have it done in the middle of the day as he walked to work seemed to be an almost manically egotistical move&#8221; on Bey IV&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>The Oakland bakery was run for years by Yusuf Bey, who preached his own form of Islam and gained street credibility by hiring felons and teaching them discipline and self-worth.</p>
<p>Bey and his group earned political capital in Oakland, winning public financing that was never paid back and meting out street justice with their own army of followers, authorities have said. But Bey&rsquo;s credibility frayed. At the time of his death in 2003, he faced child rape charges.</p>

		<p>This is why I no longer debate the relative merits of afrocentrism with blacks. If they want to believe that the black man is God, that he is the original Homo Sapiens, that Plato and Aristotle were black&hellip;as long as that bolsters his self-esteem enough to keep him from resenting whites and what they&rsquo;ve accomplished, then hopefully it will be enough to keep him from my doorstep. Let them have their fantasies. They need them.</p>

		<p>I am very surprised and I am extremely pleased that there was a conviction here.  The star eye witness was not really totally credible,  but his testimony apparently did the job.  I used to drive by the Black Muslim Bakery, where in would sometimes see Dumb White Folks feasting on food created by the Rapist, Racist Bey Sr.  Justice has been served for the White Devil, Chancey Bailey, and the poor hapless black who was distantly related to the black who killed the one of the Beys. </p>

<p>I wish I could be so insouciant about their self-indulgent delusions.  But if they believe they were once kings and queens who flew spaceships they designed around the Pyramids they designed, and then compare that glorious past to their current predicament, then on top of that gasoline you throw the match of white leftist anti-white blame whites for everything propaganda, what do you think is going to happen?  Hirsch is going to be walking down the street minding his own business, and at him will come several blacks waiting take out the &#8220;pale oppressor&#8221; who stole all that glory from them.</p>

		<p>What happened to Chauncey Bailey routinely happens to journalists in Africa. However there is one big difference. In this country justice is served (at least for now).</p>

		<p>Sounds like another black on black crime.  If the white media reports it, it is racism.  If they don&rsquo;t report it, it is racism.  </p>

<p>As I always say, when your dealing with blacks, you just can&rsquo;t win.</p>
