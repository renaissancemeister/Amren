<h1>ICE Has Released More Than 8,000 Criminal Illegal Aliens Into U.S. Since 2009</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, Cybercast News Service (CNS), May 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which is responsible for enforcing U.S. immigration laws inside the country, has released more than 8,000 illegal aliens convicted of crimes onto the streets of the United States since fiscal 2009, according to ICE data released by House Judiciary Chairman Lamar Smith (R.-Texas).</p>
<p>Citing these statistics, Smith has introduced legislation that would allow Homeland Security&rsquo;s ICE to keep criminal illegal aliens in custody longer than the current six-month period established by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Keep Our Communities Safe Act&#8221; is &#8220;desperately needed,&#8221; Smith said at a hearing about the bill on May 24 because of two high court rulings that said immigrants  &mdash;  and later illegal immigrants  &mdash;  could not be detained for more than six months, if efforts to return the immigrant to his or her home country failed.</p>
<p>The result, Smith said, are thousands of criminal illegal immigrants being released in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smith said the IG found that nearly 134,000 immigrants with final orders of removal instead had been released into U.S. communities from 2001 to 2004. The IG report also found that these illegal immigrants were unlikely to ever be repatriated because of the unwillingness of their home country to provide necessary travel documents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2006 report also says: &#8220;Currently, (Detention and Removal Operations) is unable to ensure the departure from the U.S. of all removable aliens. Of the 774,112 illegal aliens apprehended during the past three years, 280,987 (36%) were released largely due to a lack of personnel, bed space, and funding needed to detain illegal aliens while their immigration status is being adjudicated. This presents significant risks due to the inability of Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and ICE to verify the identity, country-of-origin, and terrorist or criminal affiliation of many of the aliens being released.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ICE statistics show that the agency released 3,847 convicted criminal aliens in 2009; 3,882 in 2010; and 1,012 so far in 2011.</p>
<p>The data also show the citizenship country of the convicted criminal and non-criminal illegal immigrant. For example, in FY2009, 74 convicted criminal illegal immigrants from Somalia were released in the United States. Somalia is one of the 10 countries the U.S. government has designated &#8220;countries of interest&#8221; because of believed ties to terrorism.</p>
<p>Another 79 convicted criminal illegal immigrants from Somalia were released in 2010, according to the data.</p>
<p>According to the ICE spreadsheet, 36 convicted criminal illegal immigrants from the Sudan were released. Sudan is one of four countries the U.S. State Department considers a state sponsor of terror.</p>

		<p>I guess the program secure communities is not making any community secure. Instead of locking up and then deporting criminal aliens. Secure communities instead has picked up illegals without any previous criminal history during traffic stops and then deporting them. Why does this not make sense?</p>

		<p>Of course, illegals will be the first criminals to be released in America. Then the blacks, etc. White AMERICAN prisoners will probably never get to see the light of day. Does anyone here think this is not part of our enemies AGENDA and their hate Whitey campaign, still on the march?</p>

		<p>Hmmmm&hellip;Somalia, Sudan, etc. I wonder how many illegal aliens from say, Norway, or Germany were released into American society by those charged with keeping such riff-raff OUT of our midst? I ask again, who are the REAL enemies of America??? </p>

		<p>. The IG report also found that these illegal immigrants were unlikely to ever be repatriated because of the unwillingness of their home country to provide necessary travel documents.</p>
<p>What sense does this make? Why do we need papers from other countries ? Why is even our business to take them home?<br>
Put them on a bus..for Mexico..and Hasta La Vista. <br>
They found there way here..they can find there way back</p>

		<p>Secure communities is simply a way to get digital ID checking into Americans&rsquo; wallets without our recognizing what it is so that everyone can be a finger tap away from having their RFID drivers license chip pinged to a digital map database address by Uncle Sugar&rsquo;s minions, at will.</p>
<p>The second Patriot Act legislation (the one which puts 100,000 dollar head bounties, I mean life insurance, on every soldier&rsquo;s dead corpse) required that States begin the process to create digital IDs and progress has been steady and assured, ever since.</p>
<p>If you have no real way of tracking illegals down via honest residency reporting, giving them a mandatory (free EBT food card!) ID which reports their sleeping location without their permission is the next best thing to open borders by default.</p>
<p>OTOH, actually solving this &#8216;humanitarian crisis&rsquo; ICE problem isn&rsquo;t all that hard either.</p>
<p>Namely, if you want to have diplomatic relations with the U.S. it should be -mandatory- that any illegal alien of your country, found within our borders, be automatically repatriatable to your/his homeland, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Anything less and it&rsquo;s good bye diplomatic relations and forget about ever becoming Most Favored Nation trade beneficiaries with the U.S..</p>
<p>Also, since we can&rsquo;t dump Nigerians on Mexico and act like it&rsquo;s their fault they share a border with us, I propose giving a billion dollars a year to some BOB country like Algeria or Chad or even Libya to build the worlds largest open air desert &#8216;illegal immigrant holding facility&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This nation then to take from us _all_ illegal immigrants who, for whatever reason, cannot or choose not to go home.</p>
