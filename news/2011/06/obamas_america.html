<h1><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/articles/print/270291">Obama&rsquo;s America in Black and White</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Seth A. Forman, National Review, June 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Platitudes about the civic utopia that would spring forth from the election of Barack Obama have vanished. Thomas Friedman&rsquo;s claim that &#8220;the American Civil War ended, as a black man &hellip; became president of the United States,&#8221; has now been replaced by PBS host Tavis Smiley&rsquo;s prediction that the 2012 presidential election is &#8220;going to be the ugliest, the nastiest, the most divisive, and the most racist in the history of this Republic.&#8221; E. J. Dionne&rsquo;s trope that &#8220;it is time to hope again. Time to hope that the era of racial backlash and wedge politics is over,&#8221; has given way to the statement by CBS&rsquo;s Bob Schieffer that recent criticism of Obama represents &#8220;an ugly strain of racism that&rsquo;s running through this whole thing.&#8221; Paul Krugman, who wrote in 2008 that &#8220;Racial polarization used to be a dominating force in our politics, but we&rsquo;re now a different, and better, country,&#8221; has taken to equating the anti-Obama Tea Party with the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the punditry that overpredicted the soothing qualities of Obama&rsquo;s presidential salve. Average citizens have also been chastened. A Rasmussen poll in October of 2010 found that just 36 percent of voters said relations between blacks and whites were getting better, down from 62 percent in July of 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that non-college-educated whites are the most alienated of racial groups. Only 44 percent of this demographic said they expected their economic situation to be better ten years from now, compared to two-thirds of minorities (and 55 percent of college-educated whites).</p>
<p>The familiar clich√©s with their subtle innuendos featuring &#8220;angry white males&#8221; who suffer from economic &#8220;anxiety&#8221; have been trotted out to explain white disillusionment. &#8220;The sense of being eclipsed demographically is almost certainly compounding the white working class&rsquo;s fear of losing ground economically,&#8221; is how Ronald Brownstein of <em>National Journal</em> adroitly phrased it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The extent to which blacks remain alienated from this historical social compact is America&rsquo;s best-kept political secret. In the simplest terms, blacks tend to be more ambivalent toward the nation&rsquo;s founding documents, institutions, and values than whites, are more likely to prefer an activist government, and are more likely to look skeptically upon free-market competition, entrepreneurship, and individualism. Polls cited by Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom in their seminal work <em>America in Black and White</em> show a marked racial divide on such questions as the proper level of governmental assistance, whether the federal government should provide more services even if it means new taxes, and whether or not it is the responsibility of government to reduce income differences among people.</p>
<p>In other words, even though the 2010 census reveals that residential segregation for blacks is at its lowest level ever (the average black lives in a community that is 54 percent nonblack), blacks remain the most politically segregated group. There is indeed no greater predictor of voting patterns than being black  &mdash;  not income, not education level, not marriage status, not age, not religious affiliation, not party affiliation, not profession. Once the voter is known to be black, it can be estimated with roughly 90 percent confidence that he will pull the lever for a Democrat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A greater violation of the principles of free will and individual conscience could hardly be imagined. What other group of people is officially assumed by government to have had identical experiences or suffered the same debilitating social rejection? What other group must suffer leaders like Jesse Jackson, who told a Congressional Black Caucus reception in 2009, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t vote against health care and call yourself a black man&#8221;?</p>
<p>Two related results of this special dispensation for blacks have been that they continue to trail whites, Hispanics, and Asians in the rate at which they create new businesses, and that they are overrepresented in government employment. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pundits who spoke of a post-racial America if Obama became president were ignoring the fact, laid out in his two autobiographies and evident throughout his career, that Obama himself embodies the ambivalence that many blacks feel toward the &#8220;American creed,&#8221; a set of beliefs and attitudes born from a revolution against state authority and centered on the ability of individuals to determine their own destiny.</p>
<p>The result is that the country now seems to be teetering on the edge of race-based political partisanship. {snip}</p>
<p>The Democratic Party could become even more dependent on racial minorities, as blacks continue to interpret the white turn against Obama as cruel racial rejection. Arrayed against the party of minorities will be the predominantly white Republican Party, completely bereft of blacks and increasingly heedless of their concerns. Rather than eliminating race as a significant issue in American politics, the Obama presidency appears to have rendered it the central cleavage in American life for years to come.</p>

<p>This is where an otherwise decent (but not great) article fails big time.  Blacks aren&rsquo;t the way they are because they have had improper leadership or spokesmen that engage in perfidy, and they&rsquo;re not that way because we pander to them with affirmative action and cushy government jobs.  They&rsquo;re not that way because we &#8220;failed&#8221; to teach them the glory of the founding documents.  Sorry, NR, and all the neo and lamer cons that write for it, blacks are that way because they are born that way.  </p>

		<p>The most explosive part of all this might be uncovering the actual facts of the President&rsquo;s upbringing.  Not much of what circulates about his background actually survives reasonable skepticism.  There is very little hard information that race was ever important in his upbringing. </p>

		<p>Relations between blacks and whites are getting worse.  It&rsquo;s due to abysmal black attitudes, blaming ALL their failures on whites, and the increasing number of black on white attacks.</p>
<p>Relations between blacks and Hispanics are getting worse also.  While blacks can&rsquo;t use the same lame excuse of racism and oppression they use with whites, they don&rsquo;t really need an excuse, because they fight with everybody, which includes Asians, as well.</p>
<p>The only possible way to improve race relations is to relocate blacks to two states and build a 100&rsquo; wall around them with no gates.  Aid packages can be dropped in via parachutes.</p>
<p>Not having anyone to fight with but themselves, there won&rsquo;t be anybody left in about twenty years.</p>

		<p>There are three major errors in this article. First, it assumes the lack of blacks in high-tech and other entrepreneurial type businesses is due only to their overrepresentation in government and other public sector jobs. I.e.,the &#8220;new social compact&#8221; between the government and blacks has somehow tricked blacks who otherwise would be successful entrepreneurs into accepting high-prestige but lower paying sinecures in government and public service bureaucracy. </p>
<p>This idea ignores both the desires of blacks themselves and - perhaps more importantly - the brick wall of IQ. Most hi-tech and many other entrepreneurial enterprises require well above average intelligence, at least in the 130 IQ range and very often considerably above that. For blacks, even highly educated, far above average blacks who score higher than most whites on IQ tests, this is a barrier they cannot penetrate - only tiny numbers of blacks have the requisite IQ&rsquo;s for success in such endeavors.</p>
<p>Of course, any NR writer these days (except for John Derbyshire) isn&rsquo;t going to admit IQ might limit black success in entrepreneurial businesses. It&rsquo;s all government&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>The second error is the statement that &#8220;a Republican party completely bereft of blacks will become increasingly heedless of their concerns.&#8221; Rubbish. The G.O.P. is essentially bereft of rank and file blacks today, yet panders shamelessly to any black it can find, both from a sense of white guilt and a mistaken belief that blacks can be converted into middle-class white people in their beliefs.</p>
<p>The final error is the assumption that a wider racial cleavage in the electorate is a bad thing. Reading between the lines one can tell that the author, a typical race-blind &#8220;mainstream conservative,&#8221; is horrified that white people might actually come together as a group, vote their own interests, and start pushing back against the multiculturalists and globalists. This prospect might upset the author, but it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.   </p>

		<p>This news story recapitulates the Anti-White Narrative, and can best begin to discredit it by characterizing all the stereotypes and sneers as exactly that: the Anti-White Narrative.</p>
<p>Once we understand how naming this line of defamation can help to de-rail it, perhaps we will understand the value of using our white voice in a white context to block this kind of hate speech.</p>

		<p> An excellent column, Mr. Forman. It&rsquo;s good to see National Review be more forthright than it usually is about the crisis of race in this country, and to allow the writer to point out some inconvenient and embarrassing (to the Left) truths.</p>
<p> Is the 2012 election campaign likely to be the &#8220;most racist&#8221; in the history of the Republic? Possibly. And maybe that would be a good thing   &mdash;   to stop playing &#8220;Let&rsquo;s Pretend&#8221; and &#8220;blow out the carbon,&#8221; so to speak.</p>

<p>While the Republican Party may be nearly bereft of blacks it will never be heedless of their concerns.  Always the Republican Party will keep selling out whites in a hopeless attempt to get the black vote.  The Republican leadership never dares to come out against affirmative action, even though white people vote to eliminate it every chance they get.  The Republican Party occasionally makes noises against illegal immigration but will never get serious about stopping that source of cheap labor for our corporate masters.  And certainly the Republican Party will never vote to reduce <i>legal</i> immigration.<br>

		<p>If Republicans cared about the concerns of conservative whites the way Democrats care about the concerns of liberal blacks, the Republicans could not only win, but it would be meaningful.</p>
<p>But as it is, the Republicans will do little with affirmative action, they will do little to stop illegal immigration, they will do little to fix public schools.  In the end, they will do little if they win.</p>

		<p>The fact of the matter is that the various races have differences beyond skin color. If Blacks were, indeed, the same as Whites with the exception of skin color they would have long ago assimilated and there would be no racism in this country.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the various races also differ in IQ, temperment and emotions. The average Black is more aggressive and impulsive than the average White. The average Black commits more violent crime than the average White for the same reason that men commit more violent crime than women.</p>
<p>Also, because the average Black has a lower IQ than the average White, he cannot compete as well in this capitalistic society. He would therefore be better off in a socialist society. Hence his voting pattern and hence his employment in government and lack of employment in the high tech industry and his lack of representation in management and in business ownership.</p>
<p>Blacks and White are too disparate to assimilate. It is just not going to happen. Until Blacks and Whites are willing to admit what most people know, solutions cannot be found. You cannot solve a problem until the problem is identified.</p>

		<p>The government is the problem.  When blacks fail to achieve or are underrepresented in positions the government changes the rules or standards for them. Civil rights was never about swinging the pendulum to the middle to make things fair.  Civil rights was about raising blacks up while putting whites down.  I told a black co-worker that I am am not celebrating diversity because it means the end of whites.  He laughed and agreed with me when I said &#8220;Why should I celebrate my demise &#8220;.  </p>

		<p>Blacks make up a fraction above 12% of the American population, and yet the media act as though it were half.  Surveys have shown, moreover, that a good number of Americans believes blacks comprise anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of the nation.  If someone lives in a city with a large black population, I suppose he might get that impression.  Or if he watches a lot of contemporary TV or movies, he might.  <br>
The only real, ongoing problem we have with blacks is crime  &mdash;  a problem that every nation on earth has if it contains blacks.  In the past, societies contained most of the problem by various forms of segregation.  Even countries and states that had few whites and many blacks managed to keep their affairs in order by maintaining strict control of the black majority.  <br>
Blacks&rsquo; low IQ and lack of ambition shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for whites.  In the past, we relegated them to their own schools and &#8220;black jobs&#8221; and basically left them alone.  They either left us alone or faced the police and long prison terms.  <br>
Blacks have proven that no amount of welfare, job creation, or sympathy, or even a black President will mollify them.  They are simply emboldened and want more.</p>

<p>Is this guy having a laugh? The GOP, its voters and conservatives in general bend over backwards to court blacks. It was Newt Gingrich who saved affirmative action in 1996. They had the votes to end this racist policy but Newt claimed ending quotas was driven by &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I read the full article and came across this:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no coincidence that the nation&rsquo;s wealthiest majority-black suburb, Prince George&rsquo;s County in Maryland, is a bedroom community of Washington, D.C.; 41 percent of employed blacks living in Prince George&rsquo;s County work for the state, local, or federal government and another 10 percent work in the nonprofit sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in DC and can tell you that Prince George&rsquo;s county is a run down ghetto. The local news often leads with murders from either DC or PG County.</p>
<p>If PG County is the best blacks can do they might as well give up.</p>

		<p>The charge of &#8220;racism&#8221; should not be used to suppress the expression of legitimate concerns about black social pathology, especially black crime.<br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, the President&rsquo;s family is so squeaky clean and picture perfect as to remind one of &#8220;The Huxtables,&#8221; or even to suggest &#8220;Leave it to Beaver,&#8221; and &#8220;Ozzie and Harriet.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
That said, the Democrats would be better off if they had nominated a straight arrow in 2008: that is to say a white combat veteran of the War in Vietnam, the War in the Gulf, or perhaps both, who attends church and is faithful to his wife. He could be liberal on economic issues, but on important matters of culture he needed to be someone a white filling station attendant in rural Georgia could feel comfortable with.<br>
 <br>
Being a member of Jerimiah Wright&rsquo;s congregation was foolish. Democrat politicians who aspire to national office cannot carry that kind of baggage around with them, especially if they are black. </p>

		<p>6/26/11, @J.Engelman, Your point is well taken about black crime. Even the late NYPD Comm. Ben Ward was quoted as saying(1988) &#8220;our dirty secret is blacks are 25% of the NYC population but do 70% of the crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>This not to say all black are criminals, this only proves courts are too lenient on the perps.</p>

		<p>Lets see here. Blacks and Mexicans make up more than 3/4 of all local state, and Fed. jobs. But as of yet don&rsquo;t make up 1/2 of the population. Go to any Mexican store, eatery, or home depot, Target, Walmart on and on&hellip;who makes up the vast majority of employees? Mexicans and blacks.</p>
<p>I have rental properties in S/E Fresno &#8220;little Mexico&#8221; Let me give you an example why Mexicans and blacks vote Democratic.</p>
<p>I rent to a young strong Mexican man with a family of 3 girls and a wife. All able bodied and nice family. They pay their rent with Section 8, they are given food stamps, all medical is free, and everyone of them are labeled disabled, receiving additional moneys and free available programs for this and that.</p>
<p>They own a boat and two cars and throw many parties a year with 200.00 rental bounce houses for the kids, liquor, big grill parties and on it goes. That&rsquo;s not to mention two cell phones, home phone, Direct TV.</p>
<p>Their children speak little English like their dad. The phone bill is in Spanish, the Direct TV. is also in Spanish, communications with banks and DMV, are all in Spanish.</p>
<p>Here is the point, who staffs the disability offices?</p>
<p>90% is staffed by Mexicans and some blacks. Whites need not apply. The Mexicans take care of their own. How do I know all this I talk to them. I ask questions, and for the most part simple observation will tell you as well.</p>
<p>The Feds. Have managed to buy the votes of the &#8220;poor&#8221; even lowering the standard more. The Feds have colluded with big unions going them preferential treatment like, excused from the Obamacare, special privileges to the White House, and passing pro union legislation and on it goes. All unions vote democratic.<br>
The Feds. pay their employees at the rate of 1 1/2 times more than the private sector, if you count time off, benefits, holiday pay and hourly pay. Your getting the idea by now.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  olewhitelady.</p>
<p>Not true.</p>
<p>We have plenty of problems with blacks beyond crime   &mdash;  the devastation of schools and problem of &#8220;educating&#8221; average IQ&rsquo;s of 80   &mdash;   not to mention that educational dollars are taken away from YOUR white children in the name of &#8220;social justice&#8221;,  the physical destruction of neighborhoods and entire communities, the drag and cost on businesses that are mandated to hire lazy, unproductive blacks, the massive amount of white taxpayer monies wasted on welfare to maintain black populations, the disproportionate medical care blacks need due to their slovenly health habits.</p>
<p>Blacks are a scourge on every white civilization in which they&rsquo;ve been allowed to settle, cannot cope with living in First World cultures, and are only doing what is normal for them.</p>
<p>The Man @ #11 has succinctly stated the root cause:</p>
<p><b>The government is the problem.</b></p>

		<p><i>The Democratic Party could become even more dependent on racial minorities, as blacks continue to interpret the white turn against Obama as cruel racial rejection. </i></p>
<p>When are blacks going to figure out that Obama&rsquo;s border policy is a racial rejection of <i>them</i>?</p>
<p>White Southerners turned against the Democratic Party in 1948 and 1960 without voting Republican. Some blacks might be enticed to do the same  &mdash;   vote third, or stay home.  It wouldn&rsquo;t take too many to do real damage to Democratic hopes  &mdash;   and make the party pay for its sins to <i>all</i> American races.</p>

		<p>Race is a problem? What problem?  Maybe it&rsquo;s a problem for racists, but not for the rest of us who passionately embrace the enriching diversity that surrounds us and contributes so much vibrancy to our communities and culture.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you worry that drudge might be a racist?  He&rsquo;s back to over reporting stories that &#8220;reflect poorly upon the community of color&#8221;.  Last time he put the race war headlines together, he was attacked for his &#8220;disgusting and vile&#8221; reporting.   He then cleaned up his headlines. </p>
<p>But the news didn&rsquo;t stop, and race evidently won&rsquo;t stop being a problem just because disgusting and vile websites tell the truth.  He must have gotten fed up with the intransience of violent and dangerous blacks, so he&rsquo;s back to honest reporting tonight:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Being a member of Jerimiah Wright&rsquo;s congregation was foolish. Democrat politicians who aspire to national office cannot carry that kind of baggage around with them, especially if they are black.&#8221; <br>

Foolish?  It hardly hurt him.  He carried around that kind of baggage, and still got into the White House anyway!</p>

		<p>Is black violence getting worse or do we just know more about it, because of all the alternative news sources on the internet?</p>
<p>I made a quick surf of the internet regarding a couple of stories from the Drudge Report reporting flash mob attacks and a couple of black on white beatings, especially the one with the kid who was set upon and viciously beaten by a gang of blacks, and I&rsquo;ve never seen so much anti-black rage in my life.</p>
<p>Is this just now forming or is it too noticeable simply because it is now being published on the internet?</p>
<p>Some of the most outraged were on Beck&rsquo;s The Blaze:<br>
https://goo.gl/e1sN5</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re seeing an amazing shift in public opinion.</p>

<p>Of course, any NR writer these days (except for John Derbyshire) isn&rsquo;t going to admit IQ might limit black success in entrepreneurial businesses. It&rsquo;s all government&rsquo;s fault.<br>

 <br>
Conservative writers often blame the government, or Democrats for problems that are more specifically caused by blacks. In cities where blacks are numerically insignificant, like San Jose, and Honolulu, Democrat run cities have low crime rates and well performing public schools. <br>
 <br>
The public school system of Washington, DC is the third most expensive public school system, and performs worse than any of the states. This is not because Washington is run by the Democrats, but because 85 percent of the student body in Washington, DC is black.  <br>

		<p>Relationships between Whites and all other racial groups are getting worse, and worse with each passing day. I blame colleges for this more than any other factor. I just finished taking a humanities class in which I was told by my professor (and Carolina NAACP head) that the Greeks stole everything they knew from nameless black philosophers. I asked him 3 times for the name of these philosophers, and the names of their so works (so that I may add their books to my home library.) Mr. NAACP never answered that question. Today I start my first sociology class-I can only imagine what hatred for Whites this will bring. </p>

		<p>I would suggest that the problem is not low IQ but transient level IQ, resulting from a 20% interbreeding level.  87 is like the eternal tweener or young adolescent.  Knowing what they want but unwilling or unable to (yet) press ahead with a legitimate route to achieving it.</p>
<p>These are NOT Black Africans (
<p>The cat is out of the bag as it were, so long as blacks ride the line they will ask why they can&rsquo;t do this _all the time_ and so long as whites continue to see massive race pandering and fiscal abuse (Stimulus and Health Care on the edge of a massive depression), they will try to act like the parents who take away the keys after junior has wrapped the Lexus around a flagpole.</p>
<p>It is only the idiot, _evil_, spin makers who are making this black vs. white and we are falling for it, again, because it&rsquo;s such an easy, intuitive, leap to make.  Well, yes and no&hellip;</p>
<p>I would also suggest that we need to avoid letting racism be the new fad-of-bad card behind which the nation rallies.  The poster above me suggests that Obama should not have been even a contender with the baggage he brought yet the fact is, he was.  Why?  I would suggest that fickle youth and tired-of-it middle classers voted for him strictly because he represented a new hook.</p>
<p>We need to avoid letting polarism be the divide by which defending the helpless black president from the evil racist white is the &#8216;newest new&rsquo; in the political game.</p>
<p>If you want to challenge Obama, ask him to divide himself from the Hispanics by opposing, outright, illegal immigration.  Starting with something incontrovertible, like a BIG FENCE.  That will buy him back a sizeable percentage of &#8216;Republicans never would have&hellip;&rsquo; whites and frankly, will not mean all that much, as a function of policy efforts, as we head into the Post-Peak depression. </p></p>

		<p>Heard today about Hispanic (Corpus Christi,TX), falling behind academically, what? falling behind from where? The Hispanics don&rsquo;t respect education, their drop out rate is astronomical, and while in school they seldom excell.  </p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics suffer from the same malady, &#8220;the government can&rsquo;t make brains, or character, or motivation for upward mobility.&#8221;  The Gov can print bankrupt money, and useless ideas and programs.</p>
<p>America is now paying useless people for citizenship, and for their next vote.  What a sham.  China &#8220;please send money.&#8221;</p>
