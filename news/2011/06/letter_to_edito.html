<h1>Letter to Editor: Writer Sees Race as Key to Gang Activity, Crime</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Times Leader, June 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>We will not be able to solve the gang problem in Northeastern Pennsylvania unless we are willing to speak the truth about race and crime. The facts are this: Most of the gangs are predominately made up of black or Hispanic members.</p>
<p>Violent crime is disproportionately committed by nonwhites. This region seemingly was a safer place to live until the racial demographic started to change. Does anyone, in his or her right mind, want Wilkes-Barre or Hazleton to turn into another Camden or Detroit?</p>

<p>We are seeing this happening in Europe.  Everyday it seems some prominent voice is joining the struggle, giving courage to thousands.</p>

<p> As a child, I remember the cities in NE PA being nice and clean, with a small town look and a friendly feel. Imagine my shock when a business trip took me through Exton, PA, circa 2010. It looked like a comparable wasteland, no unlike the pre-Guiliani Bronx. That also coincided with a noticeable demographic shift that took place in the meantime. </p>
<p>Multitudes were hanging out, sitting on stoops and street corners in the middle of the day. I would wager the reason phenomenon is the relocation of ghetto dwellers from NYC and recently gentrified parts of New Jersey thanks to Section 8 vouchers.          </p>

		<p> The letter writer is absolutely correct, of course. As no name was published with the letter, at least he/she won&rsquo;t have to fear having their house firebombed, or being the victim of a &#8220;beat-down&#8221; on the street.</p>
<p> No more so than any other White resident of that gloriously diverse corner of Pennsylvania, anyway.</p>

		<p>Yes, that reality, my own witness happen in Los Angeles twice in 1975 and 1981,there both of blacks&hellip;.. one in Seattle in 1982, there blacks.  In Phoenix in 1997, there hispanics, same with in Orange,CA in 2000.  My former co worker black guy did pulled the gun toward other players at basketball game in Mesa,AZ in 1998,there no shot yet&hellip;. I believe that more crimes by hispanics and blacks&hellip;..IF YOU REFUSE TO BELIEVE THEN GO TO SEE DOJ record will show which most race attend to prison/jail&hellip;.</p>

<p>As Obama pursuades Puerto Rico to become a state, the city of New York allows illegals, primarily from Puerto Rico, to enter the United States by the thousands each year.</p>
<p>New York is active in increasing illegal immigration causing massive spill-over to occur into adjoining states.</p>
<p>Unless Pennsylvanians begin to call-in and/or write their local elected officials, whites living in the Pocono Mountains, Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, York, and Lancaster, areas will remain passive until non-whites displace them.</p>
<p>Some whites have already decided to live side-by-side non-whites at the cost of their christian standard of living.</p>
<p>To give Pennsylvania and the rest of the United States an idea of what North Eastern Pennsylvanians tolerate in accepting illegals and other non-whites to live among them, here are 3 cases out of thousands which have occurred over the past 5 years:</p>
<p>NE,PA - A Puerto Rican living with a young white woman killed her with a single blow to the head using a screw driver while their illegitimate child slept in a nearby bedroom.</p>
<p>He later buried her body in a shallow wooded area a few miles from their apartment after a failed attempt to burn the body.</p>
<p>The womans remains were found by a young boy hunting with his family.</p>
<p>The Puerto Rican, who was later given a life sentence at tax-payer expense, had gotten into a jealous rage because his girlfriend was taking college courses while he slept with her friends.</p>
<p><br>
NE,PA - An African woman was decapitated in her apartment with a kitchen knife at the hands of her boyfriend days after a break up.<br>
Her boyfriend was also an African immigrant.</p>
<p><br>
NE, PA- A black woman living in an apartment was brutally set on fire by her live-in boyfriend.</p>
<p>The woman was found walking down a dimly lit alley in smoke.<br>
She later died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital.</p>
<p>The womans boyfriend, who was black, was later found and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

		<p> There are still a lot of towns/regions in PA that are predominatly White. Fight like the brave leaders in Hazleton did.<br>
All small towns must fight the fight before it gets out of hand.<br>
A social network of race realists must radicalize small-town America. Get ready now for the future.</p>

		<p>Blacks and Hispanics do not have high crime rates because of white racism. White racism persists because blacks and Hispanics have high crime rates. This is because they are closer, in number of generations, to stone age savagery than are whites and Orientals. <br>
 <br>
Civilization breeds a racial population for law obedience because the criminal justice system of a civilized nation gradually removes those with criminal predispositions from the gene pool. <br>

		<p>NAVY, it&rsquo;s crimes like these and their obnoxious, sadisitic and vile behavior that leads Ameicans of Slavic descent like me to regard immigrants as &#8220;darkie&#8221; invadiers. My ancestors suffered horribly at the hands of Muslim and non-white invaders, when they were not being oppressed by other Slavs. That is why I want them all dead, expelled or both. Why do you think I admire the likes of Vlad the Impaler, and Slobodon Milosevic? The fought for their people, and died doing it. But they also took a lot of invaders out of the picture permanently before they were executed by their and their people&rsquo;s enemies.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in PA for thirty-one years, all of them spent in the suburbs of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>No doubt that Northeast Philly and some other sections are crime -ridden; the rest of the Philly area and its suburbs seems to be very peaceful.</p>
<p>Of course, PA is a right to carry state, which always reduces crime rates.  I avail myself of that right, at least whenever I have to travel through largely black and Hispanic areas. </p>

 <br>
We have a crime problem because we have a minority problem. Whites in the United States have nearly the same low crime rate as whites in Europe. Orientals in the United States have nearly the same lower crime rate as Orientals in Asia.<br>
 <br>
It is the blacks and Hispanics who give the United States a high crime rate. Those people have high crime rates everywhere in the world that they live. No, I don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s because of &#8220;white racism.&#8221; </p>

		<p>NE Penn. is part of huge exurban arc around New York City were non-whites who have been displaced from the city itself by more recent immigration have settled.  Because the suburbs of NYC are mostly wealthy, Blacks, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans who are being pushed out of the city itself by Mexican, Chinese and Indian immigrants have to go 50-150 miles outside of the city to depressed old mill towns to find housing they can pay for with their section 8 vouchers.  Upstate New York and Western Massachusetts are heavily affected by this trend too.  </p>
