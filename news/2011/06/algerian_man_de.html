<h1><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8567331/Algerian-man-denied-French-nationality-because-of-sexism.html">Algerian Man Denied French Nationality Because of Sexism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), June 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The man&rsquo;s application was refused because &#8220;his idea of sexual equality is not that of the republic&#8221;, according to a high-ranking official quoted by French radio station Europe 1.</p>
<p>The man, who has not been identified, is married to a Frenchwoman, but does not allow her to leave the family home freely, it was claimed.</p>
<p>The French constitution states that the government can refuse nationality or strip nationality for a &#8220;lack of integration&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the interior minister, Claude Gu√©ant, told the Guardian that the man had failed to accept the French way of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;His behaviour showed a lack of assimilation into the French community; it was incompatible with the values of the French republic, notably in respect to the values of the equality of men and women.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision came after far-right leader Marine Le Pen wrote to French MPs asking them to support an end to dual nationality, claiming it &#8220;undermines republican values.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy is reportedly &#8220;very favourable&#8221; to ending dual nationality, the Guardian reports.</p>

		<p>Western nations can be an inspiration to the rest of the world when they proudly stand firm on their principles and sovereignty. Obsequiousness and multiculturalism never won anyone&rsquo;s respect, least of all the respect of those being pandered to. </p>

		<p>Dual nationality should be mandatory for non-whites, as an alternative to not giving them a &#8216;white passport&rsquo; at all.</p>
<p>If citizenship is revoked, you can&rsquo;t have someone being stateless.</p>

		<p> Who would have thought the French would take a stand. But then again, the Gaullist style nationalism I thought was overboard may be their salvation and a rallying point of hope for Whites in America and worldwide. Not that we won&rsquo;t have to take up arms if we reached the breaking point of no return.</p>

		<p>The headline should say French CITIZENSHIP denied, not French &#8220;nationality&#8221;.   There&rsquo;s a big difference between citizenship and nationality. Anyone can fill out some papers and get citizenship nowadays. But nationality is what you ARE, and no papers or laws can change that.</p>

		<p>Makes me want to go to mother France and join the Nationalist party. Might not want to tell &#8220;Them&#8221; that, though. I grew up around Cajun French and I know the differences. I could go to college to learn Old French and medieval literature. They may pass me since I am a woman, but who are they most letting in nowadays?</p>
