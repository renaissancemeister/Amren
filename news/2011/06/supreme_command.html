			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, June 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An El Monte man was sentenced to three years in state prison Wednesday in connection with a scheme to recruit 200 Chinese nationals and charge them for joining a phony Army Special Forces unit that he led as &#8220;supreme commander,&#8221; Los Angeles County prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Under the deal with prosecutors, Chinese national Yupeng &#8220;David&#8221; Deng pleaded guilty to three felony charges including false pretenses, manufacturing deceptive government documents and counterfeit of a government seal, said Jane Robison, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney&rsquo;s office. As part of his sentence, he will be required to pay restitution to the victims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities alleged that in 2008, Deng concocted a faux military unit he called the U.S. Army/Military Special Forces Reserve unit and persuaded other Chinese nationals, primarily in the San Gabriel Valley, to join it.</p>
<p>Deng told them joining the unit &#8220;was a path to U.S. citizenship&#8221; but authorities said Deng&rsquo;s &#8220;U.S. Army/Military Special Forces Reserve&#8221; was actually an immigration scam that preyed on Chinese immigrants in the San Gabriel Valley desperate to become citizens.</p>
<p>As the self-titled &#8220;supreme commander,&#8221; Deng allegedly charged each recruit initiation fees as high as $450 and a $125 annual renewal fee. Recruits allegedly could promote themselves in rank by making cash donations to the defendant, prosecutors said.</p>

		<p>This sounds so typically Chinese. People criticize them for not being creative, but when it comes to thinking up these sorts of scams, I don&rsquo;t think anyone else comes close.</p>

		<p>You sure this isn&rsquo;t some COINTELPRO false flag style buisness to flush out or build up another yellow peril/red menace situation. WHat if its a front? Chinese paramillitaries on U.S soil is not to be joked about considering their role in the wars in Malaysia Korea and Vietnam. Don&rsquo;t forget Calderon&rsquo;s meth deal with a Chinese immigrant from Shanghai. That Worthy oriental gentelman had 800 million stashed in his house, made from selling precursor chemicals Synthesized in China. I&rsquo;m pretty sure thats enough to buy some heavy weight support in a California nearing collapse.Hell it would be poetic justice after the opium war. Cash takeover of California bought with the welfare money of the parasites that infest it. <br>
Wouldn&rsquo;t be &#8220;creative&#8221;, but its not like the British didn&rsquo;t show them exactly how to do it. </p>

		<p>Remember the old stories of how Chinese Coolies feared having their &#8216;pigtails&rsquo; cut off because &#8216;God&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to grab hold of to lift them into paradise? In my opinion this guy got off lightly compared to what a Chinese court would have doled out for a similar offense. Somewhere in the deep dark recesses of the &#8216;news speak&rsquo; that pervades our media I remember hearing that China leads the world in executions for crimes against humanity and the state. And nary a whimper from the UN or amnesty international. I think they should have  marched this guy out to the back of the Court House and summarily executed  him. And published the video on You-Tube. The fact that the message would go out that Americans aren&rsquo;t such big softies, anyway would be a lot like cutting off that Coolies &#8216;pigtail&rsquo;<br>
Americans aren&rsquo;t pushovers even if your country does own a good portion of our national debt and almost owns our economy.</p>

		<p>Nice satire, Vick, but you left out the 8&rsquo;s.  Eight is a lucky number for Chinese, so &#8220;Gold Mountain Special Lucky Army Force Unit Number 888&#8221; would have been spot-on.</p>
<p>As I recall, the character for &#8220;four&#8221; is the same as the one for &#8220;death&#8221;, hence the fascination with &#8220;eight&#8221;.  A quick look on Wikipedia at Taiwanese naval ships, for example shows a distinct avoidance of the number &#8220;4&#8221; in ship hull numbers, and the South Korean Navy has done the same thing.  The use of non-sequential hull numbers within ship classes by mainland China makes identifying such a trend there problematical.</p>

		<p>The ironic thing, Lone Star Rebel, about the stubborn Chinese attachment to pigtails a century ago was that this hairstyle was imposed upon the Han Chinese as a sign of submission when the Manchus took over in 1644, founding the Quing Dynasty.</p>
<p>As an aside, while the term &#8220;coolie&#8221; has perjorative connotations to the ethnically hypersensitive, it really just means something like &#8220;day laborer&#8221; in both Mandarin (kuli) and Cantonese (gu lei).  The term is basically the same in Thai and Malay.</p>
