<h1>As Asian Indian Community Grows, Pressure Builds for New School Holidays</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Fernandez, Mercury News, June 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For many in the Bay Area&rsquo;s rapidly growing Asian Indian population, Diwali is as important as Christmas is to Christians.</p>
<p>Now there is a budding movement to have the Hindu holy day declared a school holiday in Fremont, Sunnyvale and San Jose, cities where Asian Indians comprise a significant portion of the overall enrollment.</p>
<p>While the push for a school holiday is in its infancy, Silicon Valley&rsquo;s Indian community is growing both in numbers and influence. For their part, local school officials say it&rsquo;s important to recognize that diversity  &mdash;  but adding a new holiday to the school calendar can be a major headache.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2010 Census shows the Indian population in the Bay Area has grown dramatically over the past decade, from about 150,000 in 2000 to about 250,000 last year, with about 118,000 in Santa Clara County alone. Indians now comprise 18 percent of the population in Fremont and 15 percent in Sunnyvale.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the increase, many, even in the Indian community, wonder about the fairness of shutting down school for Diwali, a festival of lights that falls in either October or November depending on the year. Does that mean schools should also close to celebrate the end of Ramadan for the Muslims, Vaisakhi for the Sikhs, Tet for the Vietnamese, and Rosh Hashanah for the Jews?</p>
<p>Go ahead, say the Diwali supporters, the more holidays celebrated, the better.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Celebrating diversity&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Passaic&rsquo;s Assistant Superintendent Lawrence Everett said the school board unanimously  &mdash;  and without controversy  &mdash;  voted it a district holiday six years ago, four years after Three Kings Day also was approved as a no-school day. Schools in Passaic are also closed for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, while schools in South Brunswick close for Eid al-Fitr, the end of the Muslim fasting holiday, Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice.</p>
<p>Everett said the Diwali closure was in &#8220;response to our Indian population,&#8221; which totals a little more than 2 percent of its 13,000-student body. &#8220;It&rsquo;s aligned to our district vision of celebrating diversity, not merely tolerating it,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Why not???  They learn little enough in school as it is.  Better stay at home and practice handwriting, the ABCs, read a book, memorize times tables or watch the history channel that spend 6 hours in school.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the marxist feminazis and liberals will get paid for the holidays.  But at least that is one less day the teachers can shove their anti White propaganda down the throats of their captive audience.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s got to be more than 15% in Sunnyvale. I live in Sunnyvale and that&rsquo;s all I see on the streets. Go up to SFO and check out the international arrivals, and you&rsquo;ll see mostly Indians coming in. Where I live, most all the whites have already moved out. On my street there&rsquo;s only myself and two other residences that are white. All the rest is Asian/Indian. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about time to put the place up for sale. Think next year will be my last here; the take-over has pretty much been completed. </p>

		<p>In segregated schools this makes sense.</p>
<p>We need more of this, not less.  When the time comes to ask for all-white schools, this is will be the reason.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism makes for bad immigration policy, but excellent  segregation policy.</p>

		<p>Ach, they come for a richer version of India. Give them numbers and they&rsquo;ll colonize, and it&rsquo;ll be the same with Moslems. Of course with moslems it&rsquo;ll be worse than having too much time off and throwing colored dust in the air. </p>
<p>Go to any tech city and you&rsquo;ll see lots of Indians. </p>
<p>Gregory Clark in &#8216;A Farewell to Alms&rsquo; talks about how, sometime when India was trying to get into the cotton trade, their work ethic was so inferior to that of the English that it was cheaper for them, even with English machines, to ship it to England, get it ginned (or woven or whatever) there, and ship it back (to India) than to do it there. I haven&rsquo;t seen problems with the Indian work ethic so far (maybe a bit) but, I&rsquo;m not for letting them out of the American, Protestant Work Ethic Pressure Cooker even a little bit, to see how they go. </p>

		<p>Frankly, I have little or no objection to Indian immigrants.  They&rsquo;re smart, hard working, rarely involved in crime, and in general become productive citizens.</p>
<p><br>
However, I expect them to become loyal Americans and celebrate normal American holidays. If they want to continue to observe Indian holidays that&rsquo;s OK too. Many other immigrant groups, going back to the Irish and Italians, celebrate ethnic holidays among their own.</p>

<p>I love those days when the Teachers&rsquo; unions shut down the schools!  Hooray!  The fewer days they can poison the kids&rsquo; minds.  HOME SCHOOL FOR ALL!!!  CLOSE ALL THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS!!!</p>

<p>This is my comment:</p>
<p>I, for one, am sick to death of accomodating all these religions and cultures. Let them all go back to their own lands and quit trying to change ours.</p>
<p>But then, we are the fools who allowed it all in the first place.</p>

<p>Did 260 people (2% of 13,000) complain so vociferously and demand they be given a holiday, or were administrators like Everett such milquetoast, spineless pushovers that they threw themselves on the track long before the train arrived? I&rsquo;m betting on the latter. What a horrible precedent they&rsquo;ve set. </p>

<p>Nor would I, if they weren&rsquo;t here in such huge numbers.  It&rsquo;s the <i>scale</i> of their presence that&rsquo;s objectionable.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;They&rsquo;re smart, hard working, rarely involved in crime, and in general become productive citizens.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Then I suggest you move to India, where you can enjoy the company of those smart, hard-working productive citizens at all times.  But leave <i>my</i> country the way the Founding Fathers wanted it to be, please.<br>

		<p>Want to bet that these are all fraudsters abusing the H-1B visa which has replaced 3 MILLION of our best and brightest engineers with fraudsters with fake resumes and fake degrees from India. </p>
<p>75% unemployment for our best and brightest is a kick in the teeth and a death sentence for people who worked hard their whole life</p>
<p>Even in the depression years of 2007, 2008, and 2009 they were importing over 300,000 Indians</p>
<p>This H-1B is a statement from the US government - go die, we don&rsquo;t are about you.</p>

		<p>This and many other similar articles force me to regard America as a large dying animal on the African plain. This huge mass of meat has attracted a diversity of scavengers: lions, hyenas, jackals, vultures, etc. All are trying to devour as much as they can, each uses its own techniques. Powerful ones, lions and packs of hyenas, use brute force; jackals use stealth; vultures and other birds use stealth and flight. There is much fighting among the scavengers, but none help the scavengee. </p>
<p>The third world immigrants streaming into America are not coming here to become Americans; they are colonizing America.</p>

		<p>Joe #2: drive north a bit and you will get to the areas of Sunnyvale that are about 90% Latino instead of 90% Indian. It is not very clear from looking at the houses/condos/apartments themselves, but you can tell by looking at the cars.  More Mexican flags and fewer Ganesha decorations, you know.</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I most earnestly warn White Americans that they are on the cusp of tsunami type tidal wave of massive subcon Indian immigration that will make their experience of Mexican immigration in the past 40 years look like a presbyterian ladies summer pic-nic and tea party.<br>
  You might scoff - but just your average Canadian or Britain.</p>

		<p>If you come to this country legally, then you&rsquo;ve sworn an oath to give us your loyalty and become an American in every sense of the word. That means you&rsquo;ll go along with OUR customs, which includes OUR holidays. Is that crystal clear?</p>

		<p>My two cents:</p>
<p>I am actually against closing the schools for Diwali; we Indians can celebrate our own holidays at home and with other Indian friends and do not wish to impose &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; on the schools. We sent our kids to school to study and excel at the basics and are strongly opposed to teaching &#8220;culture&#8221; at school. American schools are going downhill because of too much focus on self-esteem, multi-culturalism, and what not. </p>
<p>For the record, I celebrate Diwali, Thanksgiving, and Christmas with my family. I go to the annual India Day festival but I have also gone to Scottish and German Festivals to learn about their cultures. One thing though, I would never go to a Kwanza festival because those things are unsafe. FYI- India Day Festival was just as safe as the Irish and German festivals.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many AR posters believe, I do like and respect whites- I am just observing with my own eyes that Indians in the U.S. do outachieve whites in math and science and that is partly due to whites being dumbed down by multiculturalism.</p>

<p>john, you must be Indian or very uninformed.<br>
As an engineer I worked and lived in Bombay for a year. Wouldn&rsquo;t send my worst enemy there. Indians are filthy, not so smart, have bad work ethics and as far as crime, well, read some statistics from India.<br>
The bottom line is, let them stay in India. I certainly don&rsquo;t want them to come here and change my country.<br>

		<p>#16, yes I believe you. Now the schools here in Sunnyvale are almost all Indian/Asian/ethnic whatever. Whites either send their kids to private school, home school, or tough it out being a part of the shrinking smaller White minority - and getting very small.</p>
<p>What most Whites do here is move out when their kids are old enough for school. I&rsquo;ve watched the trend, and most leave California entirely. </p>
<p>#14   &mdash;   Yes I know what you mean about the Latinos in the northern part of the city. Cheaper apartments and good parks/recreation seems to attract them.  </p>

		<p>The country has been floaded with hords of uneducated Indian&rsquo;s with fake degrees and fake  experiences. Majority of them are lazy,with lower IQ, aggresive and rude. they don&rsquo;t contribute much and the only people I feel sorry are millions of American IT workers, specialy older one&rsquo;s who lost their livelyhood to this greedy scam by corporations and politicans.Truly sad.</p>

		<p>None of these races, even the Indians and East Asians ever want to assimilate. They don&rsquo;t want America, they want India with flush toilets. Thats my problem with them. They all form their clique and racial and ethnic grievance brigades and whine and moan to make things more like India and Somalia. Go to India and Somalia if you want Indian and Somalia.

		<p>Many schools in the New York  &mdash;  New Jersey area close on Jewish Holidays because of the number of Jewish teachers who have to take those days off.  Maybe if you have a large number of Hindu teachers, you would be justified in closing the school on Divali, but not because a handful of students would be absent.</p>

		<p>I notice in the last year or so, there has been a dramatic increase in articles on Amren about bad behaivor by Indians and other Asian immigrants.  I hope this has opened the eyes of racially conscious whites who thought that these people wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem or that we could make alliances with them.  </p>
