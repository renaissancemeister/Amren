<h1>AZ Sheriff: Why More Troops at Korean Border than U.S. Border?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, CNS News, June 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona Sheriff Paul Babeu said the Obama administration&rsquo;s decision to extend the deployment of 1,200 U.S. National Guard troops along the U.S. border with Mexico until Sept. 30 is &#8220;pandering&#8221; and that those numbers &#8220;fall far short&#8221; of what military power is needed to keep the country safe.</p>
<p>Babeu noted, for comparison, the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to help defend it against North Korean aggression; U.S. troops have been stationed in South Korea for 58 years.</p>
<p>Babeu is the sheriff of Pinal County in southern Arizona and is on the frontlines against illegal immigration, human traffickers, drug smugglers, and potential terrorists. He was named the 2011 National Sheriff of the Year by the National Sheriff&rsquo;s Association on Sunday, June 19.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we doing?&#8221; Babeu told CNSNews.com by telephone. &#8220;We need 6,000 armed soldiers on our border to protect America. Homeland Security starts at home.&#8221; He was talking about the National Guard.</p>

		<p>By design the southern border suppose to be open for cheap labor and Democratic votes. If you guard the border they won&rsquo;t come in.</p>
<p>Now that the Republicans are the weaker of the two parties thanks to immigration, we will see further lowering of the standard of living. There will be more centralized soviet style planning by our congressional politburo and comrade Obama.   </p>

		<p>We need to drive from office all elements of political power who are leash-lackeys to high stakes PACSIGs whose commercial and social interests include replacing us as a population.  </p>
<p>At the cost of long term loss of cultural excellence too-little/too-late after it is realized that you cannot put a new sticky label over a 90 IQ and still call it American as a means to continue a first world scientific and economic state with third world cultural genetics.</p>
<p>Scientific and Engineering excellence begins with a 115 IQ and a graduate studies degree (i.e. Masters and Above).  Only about 16% of our population meet that baseline.  The rest are still Joe The Plumbers and _do not need_ to have their jobs stolen or undercut by non english speaking invaders from South Of The Border who are aided through special education, Section 8 housing and food assistance programs.</p>
<p>If such a simplistic: &#8216;This won&rsquo;t be America after the Hispanics are finished with it!&rsquo; conceptualization cannot be conveyed to our leadership and the elites who own them, then Arizona is already a lost frontier.</p>
<p>And we need to move the fight to the interior and start to think about separation.<br>

		<p> He makes a good point. South Korea is a rich country with a much larger and better equipped army than North Korea. Why do we need troops stationed in Korea? Do they really want our army of occupation? Let&rsquo;s put the troops coming home from Afghanistan on the Rio Grande, and withdraw our forces from Japan and Korea.  </p>

		<p>We strongly believe that the alliance between S.Korea and USA made the current S.Korea, a democratic and prosperous Korea. We are grateful for that and are ready to do our part as one of the most faithful allies of USA. One example can be found in Vietnam War. We sent total 320,000 soldiers to Vietnam war (~50,000 for a given time) and fought together with American soldiers. There were a few casualties (~5,000), but most of us believe that the Korea-USA alliance was worth more than that.   </p>
<p>It is sad to read Sheriff Paul Babeu&rsquo;s remark. It&rsquo;s understandable why he said that, but he could have used other example. The alliance grows on blood. (From S.Korea)</p>

		<p>Reply to SciFi:</p>
<p>The alliance is a total one-way street. It benefits South Korea but does nothing for America. American troops are stationed in South Korea, at great expense to Americans, to protect it from North Korea. Are South Korean troops stationed in North Dakota, at great expense to the South Korean taxpayer, to protect America from a Canadian invasion? Frankly I see no reason at all why Americans should risk their lives for South Korea. America would be better off in every way if it ended its &#8220;alliance&#8221; with South Korea.</p>

<p>Make that the alliance grows on AMERICAN blood. Almost 129,000 Americans were killed or wounded fighting in Korea FOR SOUTH KOREA! How many Koreans have bled fighting for America in America? Zero. </p>
<p>Btw, please don&rsquo;t mention Vietnam. America never should have got involved in that sad and futile affair.</p>

		<p>To Anon,</p>
<p>When S.Korea was poor, the majority of cost was covered by American taxpayers money (and we are very grateful for that). But in these days, S.Korea covers about a half of all cost. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the alliance is one way. I used Vietnam war as an example why it is not an one way alliance. S.Korea sent the largest number of armed force to Vietnam after USA purely out of allianceship (as USA did during Korean war). I don&rsquo;t think I have to even mention that S.Korea is on the border that demarcates the free world and the communistic world in old days and USA world-Chinese world in these days. In a sense, S.Korea is a limes of American empire.</p>
<p>You may want to pull out the American armed force from Korea because of this tiny amount of money. If so, I predict that S.Korea will fall into the Chinese world soon and Japan will follow S.Korea. Then USA has to retreat to Hawaii. Roman Empire began to crumble when the empire let barbarians cross the limes.  </p>

		<p>To 2nd Anon,</p>
<p>According to the treaty between S.Korea and USA, S.Korea has to and  will send the armed force to America if America is attacked by others. Of course, this is not likely to happen (who dares to attack America?) and that&rsquo;s why it looks like an one way street. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like alliance thing, how about seeing this way? <br>
Korean armed force is one of the largest and strongest (thanks to the American armed force here) which is under the command of an American General in Korea who in turn under the command of American president. What does it mean to you? Basically, you have one of the strongest armed force under your control by spending a tiny amount of money. Although Korean armed force is mainly staying in Korea, it is likely that it will be very handy in certain situations. I would say it&rsquo;s a bargain. </p>

		<p>And don&rsquo;t forget the 60,000 US troops still in Germany. They would be perfect to wrap around the Texas border with Mexico&hellip;.which if we do not actually defend, Mexico may soon claim adverse possession and move the border to somewhere between Dallas and Oklahoma City&hellip;..and between Houston and New Orleans.</p>
<p>Either we have a country or we do not. No matter what the Federal government does or does not do, my country is being invaded and the defense of my country requires that the invader be driven back across the border&hellip;..at bayonet point if necessary.</p>
<p>I swear, a mere 300 men could change the direction of this once-great nation.<br>

<p>I completely disagree with everything you say.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in these days, S.K.covers about half of all the costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>That still leaves the American taxpayer responsible for half of the costs. From my perspective why should we pay ANY of the cost to defend S.K.? S.K. has TWICE the population of N.K. It has a GDP FORTY times larger. It should easily be able to look after itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used Vietnam war as an example to show it wasn&rsquo;t a one-way alliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t mention that sad, futile and senseless war to me. America should NEVER have been in Vietnam and gained NOTHING by being there. Likewise America should leave S.K.</p>
<p>&#8221;..South Korea is on the border that demarcates the free world and the communistic world in old days&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Just to bring you up to speed. The Berlin wall fell. The Warsaw pact has dissolved. Germany has reunited. Eastern Europe has been liberated and the USSR has split into fifteen different countries (so far). Any justification for keeping troops in S.K. (or elsewhere) has long, long since vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;S.Korea is limes of the American empire&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I DON&rsquo;T WANT AMERICA TO BE AN EMPIRE. I want a republic with a federal government with strictly limited powers. </p>
<p>&#8220;S.Korea will fall into the Chinese world soon and Japan will follow S.Korea&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine with me. Geographically, historically and culturally these countries have far more in common with China then America. Nor do I see this as any threat to America. Is an armada of 10,000 Chinese junks going to sail 12,000 miles across the Pacific ocean to attack Oregon? </p>
<p>&#8220;Then USA has to retreat to Hawaii&#8221;.</p>
<p>So what? I don&rsquo;t want an expensive American empire in the far east. I see no gain from it. Canada and Mexico are even further back, 2,400 miles on the west coast of North America. They are not troubled by this. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t even have made Hawaii a state if it was up to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roman empire began to crumble when the empire let barbarians cross the limes&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>What a crazy analogy! The Roman empire was a geographically contiguous unit centered on the Mediterranean sea. It didn&rsquo;t have outposts thousands of miles across the ocean. Indeed Britannia was one of the first places Rome abandoned when it faced mounting barbarian pressure. It was a superflous outlier.</p>
<p>Personally if I were a south Korean I would feel humiliated and ashamed that my country still hid behind America&rsquo;s skirts like a cowering child instead of being proud and independent.</p>

		<p><i>But in these days, S.Korea covers about a half of all cost.</i></p>
<p>They should cover the entire cost.  They can well afford it   &mdash;   Their economy is way bigger than North Korea&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re buying enough South Korean cars and electronics, by the way.</p>
<p><i>S.Korea sent the largest number of armed force to Vietnam after USA purely out of allianceship</i></p>
<p>So?  As it turns out, all those wasted lives and all that wasted money was for nothing, because all of Vietnam went communist, then years later our wonderful internal traitors and corporate cheap labor hogs turned around and &#8220;normalized&#8221; relations.  Beyond all that, there&rsquo;s the moral angle   &mdash;   I do not countenance as much as one white man dying or as much as one shekel of a white society&rsquo;s wealth being spent over the matter of what kind of system of government yellow people or any non-white people should or should not have.  That means no Korea, no Vietnam, no Iraq, no Afghanistan (other than thumping the people responsible for 9/11), and no Libya.</p>
<p><i>You may want to pull out the American armed force from Korea because of this tiny amount of money. If so, I predict that S.Korea will fall into the Chinese world soon and Japan will follow S.Korea.</i></p>
<p>So?  Are we supposed to spend white lives and white money because of fears of Chinese hegemony over the Oriental world, which is pretty much a fait accompli?  Growing Chinese economic power is a direct function of American corporate treason, the desire for cheap labor and a billion new customers.  In exchange, China wants our technology and military secrets.  Chinese, Koreans and Japanese might hate each other, but they&rsquo;re far more like each other than any white person.  Likewise, I have more in common with a Pole in Poland than I do with South Koreans in South Korea.  Our foreign policy future, alliances, treaties, transnational cooperation, foreign trade, should be entirely focused on the white world.  We&rsquo;re headed for a new &#8220;cold war&#8221; divided world scenario   &mdash;   I predict the world will be divided between white and non-white.  China might become the dominant economic and military engine of the non-white world.  The new cold war may or may not involve Berlin Walls and Charlie Checkpoints, but if it happens like I think, it will greatly ensure white racial survival.</p>
<p><i>Roman Empire began to crumble when the empire let barbarians cross the limes. </i></p>
<p>Wrong.  The Roman Empire began to crumble when it let the &#8220;barbarians&#8221; immigrate, thereby making the western Empire less Roman by definition.  Yes, the &#8220;barbarians&#8221; (read:  Germanics) invaded, but they had plenty of help from the inside.<br>

<p>Yes, and the angry white people here say that line is the US&rsquo;s southern border and the barbarians speak Spanish.</p>
<p>Oh, and the North Koreans would love to see the US reduced to a heap of ruin and their leadership is cooperating with regimes that too hate America. On the other hand Mexicans have served in the US military and many have died fighting in Iraq. A Mexican once threw himself over a grenade to save his buddies. He got a Medal of Honor and US citizenship for his family.</p>

		<p>I have no doubt that Sheriff Paul Babeu is a brave man on the job.  But he showed poor judgment backing Juan McAmnesty in that man&rsquo;s latest senatorial campaign.  Sure, McCain put on a good show in pretending to be against illegal immigration while he was in a primary race against a candidate who really <i>is</i> against illegal immigration, but now that McCain is safely back in office he&rsquo;s eager to sign on to the next Pathway to Citizenship bill that comes along.</p>
<p>McCain also backs Obama&rsquo;s war in Libya (a civil war where neither side is on our side).  McCain never met a war he didn&rsquo;t like.<br>

		<p>What goes for South Korea applies equally for Okinawa, Guam, Japan, Europe, etc. We should bring ALL the troops home and stop trying to play our self-appointed role of global robocop. Why did we expand NATO to Russia&rsquo;s borders? How does making Estonia a NATO member make America any safer? How would we like it if Russia had an alliance with Mexico? What does America gain from underwriting Estonia&rsquo;s security? Estonia certainly isn&rsquo;t protecting America from anything! Why did we attack Serbia, a country that never did us any harm? How would Americans like it if Serbian warplanes mercilessly dropped bombs on the USA for 78 days like we did to them? What gave us the right to determine what Serbia&rsquo;s national boundaries should have been? For most Americans this event, and a million others, has just been dropped down the memory hole. Why are we picking a fight with China over its claims to the Spratly and Paracel islands? What do we care about that for? I doubt one in a thousand Americans could locate either one of these islands groups on an unmarked atlas or globe. Right now an American fleet is in the South China sea engaging in war drills with the Phillippines navy to support the latters territorial claims there. What do we care about that for? Why did we create an Africom command for? All such madness. Meanwhile right here at home, our southern border is crumbling away&hellip;.</p>
