			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anissa Ford, Huliq, June 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One would think that a Japanese evolutionary scientist with a strong media following would know better than to offend black women. Lately, coming down hard on black women hasn&rsquo;t worked out so well for media guys.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And now Satoshi Kanazawa&rsquo;s lost his blog and his profile page has been deleted from Psychology Today&rsquo;s website. His article and unqualified research on unattractive black women sent off a fury of protests online. 75,000 people blew up Psychology Today via email, Twitter and Facebook. Some even rang Psychology Today&rsquo;s telephones off the hook.</p>
<p>When all was said and done, Psychology Today sent an email to ColorofChange.org and informed the largest online African American political organization that Kanazawa&rsquo;s work won&rsquo;t appear on their site any longer. Psychology Today even said they&rsquo;ve instituted new rules to prevent inflammatory content in the future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kanazawa&rsquo;s blogs, for as long as Psychology Today has published them (a little over five years now) have always been controversial, racist, sexist, and unfounded. Most of his blogs are hypotheses on human nature (or why men and women do the the things that they do). Readers are drawn into Kanazawa&rsquo;s ideologies because his notions offer one explanation for human behavior in our contemporary culture and its current setting.</p>

		<p>This is the white mans fault. You see while 37000 white women are raped by black men. Almost no black women are raped by white men.Maybe that French fellow can use that as a defence when he goes on trial for attempted sexual assault of the african immigrant hotel maid who has HIV from Ghana. He could say that he was upset by the article and wanted to prove Kanazawa wrong at the risk of his own life by trying to rape a black women who might have HIV.</p>

		<p>He should not have been fired and Psychology Today will revert to just another politically correct pop magazine.</p>
<p>In the article, Satoshi Kanazawa cited respondants that were interviewed over a seven year study.  It was not his personal opinion.  </p>
<p>He analyzed the respondants and found that women were, on average, rated higher in attractiveness than men.  No surpise there.  </p>
<p>He then noted that men have higher levels of the male hormone, testosterone, than women.  No surpise there.  </p>
<p>He then noted that black women have higher levels of testoterone than women of other races.  So he hypothesized that black women, because of higher levels of testosterone, are likely to have more masculine traits and features than women of other races. Seems like a reasonable hypothesis.</p>
<p>We all know that masculine looking women and masculine acting women are less attractive to most men in particular. </p>

		<p>He didn&rsquo;t just say black women are unattractive, he also implied black men have low IQ. Double whammy! For those that don&rsquo;t want to bother Googling the &#8220;offensive passages&#8221; here is a snippet from the Huffington Post.</p>
<p><i>What accounts for the markedly lower average level of physical attractiveness among black women? Black women are on average much heavier than nonblack women. The mean body-mass index (BMI) at Wave III is 28.5 among black women and 26.1 among nonblack women. (Black and nonblack men do not differ in BMI: 27.0 vs. 26.9) However, this is not the reason black women are less physically attractive than nonblack women. Black women have lower average level of physical attractiveness net of BMI. Nor can the race difference in intelligence (and the positive association between intelligence and physical attractiveness) account for the race difference in physical attractiveness among women. Black women are still less physically attractive than nonblack women net of BMI and intelligence. Net of intelligence, black men are significantly more physically attractive than nonblack men. </i></p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p><i>The only thing I can think of that might potentially explain the lower average level of physical attractiveness among black women is testosterone. Africans on average have higher levels of testosterone than other races, and testosterone, being an androgen (male hormone), affects the physical attractiveness of men and women differently. Men with higher levels of testosterone have more masculine features and are therefore more physically attractive. In contrast, women with higher levels of testosterone also have more masculine features and are therefore less physically attractive. The race difference in the level of testosterone can therefore potentially explain why black women are less physically attractive than women of other races, while (net of intelligence) black men are more physically attractive than men of other races.</i><br>

<p>This is the difference between the way nonwhites and whites operate. When nonwhites as a group are insulted, the throw a hissyfit. When whites are insulted as a group, we do nothing.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s nothing. Whites are slandered all the time as being the focus of evil in the modern world, racist, oppressive, &#8220;ice people,&#8221; warlike, and deserving of dispossession. And yet the vast majority of whites don&rsquo;t make so much as a whimper of protest. I really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s become of us or how we were talked so effectively into giving up any semblance of self-pride or self-interest.</p>

		<p>He wasn&rsquo;t fired for saying something &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221;. To be sure, there was a backlash against the article. But the article was very, very sloppy. For example, his study was based on the opinions of only three judges. Three judges? Really???</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether he was right or not. He published an inflammatory article in his own field that was just plain sloppy. He embarrassed the university and he embarrassed the profession. And it wasn&rsquo;t the first time he had done so. They had just had enough of it.</p>

		<p>Here is an appropriate quote from Ayn Rand&rsquo;s Atlas Shrugged:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s funny. There was a time when men were afraid that somebody would reveal some secret of theirs that was unknown to their fellows. Nowadays, they&rsquo;re afraid that somebody will name what everybody knows&#8221;. </p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I don&rsquo;t care who wins: Asian male versus black females. I haven&rsquo;t got a favourite in that fight; both groups are hostile to white men.</p>

		<p>As #5 RJS said, if an opinion is so ridiculous, why not refute it with facts and logic instead of shutting it down?  Why is it that George Bush could be portrayed in political cartoons as a chimp for 8 years, but any comparison of Obama to an ape, even on a homemade poster, elicits thunderous outrage from the press?  Obviously, the complaining liberals believe there is reason to be so sensitive, and, by their protesting actions, they portray themselves as the very racists about whom they complain.</p>

		<p> Our friend, Mr. Kanazawa, committed two sins. First,mentioning  that  heredity plays some role,in a negative way, for a  person of color. Second, any mention of the heritability of IQ is verboten. Modern MSM is doctrinal PC and has been and will be for the foreseeable future. Junk science articles about heredity that heel to the PC line is the norm. </p>

<p>Good Christ, I hope you&rsquo;re joking. Strauss-Kahn hit on an African maid? He could have supermodels perched on his lap for just handing them his business card. &#8220;I&rsquo;m the head of the world&rsquo;s biggest bank&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Of course, if she was from Ghana, can HIV be far behind?</p>

		<p>For one&rsquo;s own protection, when saying anything that is even remotely critical of blacks one should restrict one&rsquo;s statements to factual assertions that are easy to document using credible sources. Even this can be dangerous. Appearance, by definition, is objective. </p>

		<p>The Elephant Man was rendered acceptable in attractiveness by those who could &#8220;cognitively override&#8221; their reflexive aversions  &mdash;  i.e.,he could be PERCEIVED as acceptable while being reflexively SEEN as aversive.  This is certainly applicable ethically to the issue at hand here and would be a productive point of engagement by PSYCHOLOGY TODAY.  But why evade what was known from experience before this research was done?  Black females have spent huge amounts when discretionary money was available to look less Black and more nearly White. When Whites initially visited various points in Africa, the better information is that they were seen as being remarkably pleasing to the native eye and enviously so.  <br>

A beacon of light continues to shine through all the storm<br>
atmosphere surrounding this matter:  a number of scholars of<br>
repute are disputing the condemnation of Kanazawa.  As has been<br>
true for decades now, in these matters, the slower news has proven to be the truer news.  At root of it all  is the massive cowardice and massive delusion on campuses that insures  &mdash;  abler whisperings aside  &mdash;  that most graduates will go forth into news rooms, community college lecterns, business management, federal law enforcement careers, etc., etc. as confident carriers of adroit misunderstanding about such issues in the behavioral sciences.   An excellent example of this dynamic took place 20 years ago at the University of Western Ontario at which Prof. J. P. Rushton, subjected then to vicious  abuse, loosened something of a very just boomerang effect by having letters in his defense from outstanding academics from several nations, all compiled and effectively dissemination rather &#8220;in house&#8221; to great  effect.  I doubt that  much was ever known of these commentaries in the major Canadian newsrooms, at NPR, BBC (?).<br>
Await the slower news online. As the late Joe Sobran observed, if you drink in the  right places with the right crowd, there&rsquo;s far far more news for you these days in the bar room than in the news room.   Will it ever be otherwise?  <br>

		<p>&#8220;One would think that a Japanese evolutionary scientist with a strong media following would know better than to offend black women.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this line.  Evolutionary psychologists often make statements and draw conclusions that run contrary to Lib-Min doublethink.  The Japanese, an incredibly homogeous and quite xenophobic group, have (as individuals) made some horribly un-PC comments (like stating the obvious about who commits the majority of crimes in the US).  </p>
<p>And I agree-if his ideas are so wrong, why can&rsquo;t his opponents just debate him or refute him with facts?  Previously, Mr.  Kanazawa wrote a whole book talking about how Asian/Japanese values may impede scientific innovation in Japan.  A White American Japanophile wrote a lengthy refutation of the book.  Never attacked the person, just the ideas.   </p>
<p>Perhaps Prof. Kanazawa should just repatriate back to Japan and continue doing this sort of research.  Unlikely anyone here in Japan would get too offended by his work.</p>

		<p>Post #18</p>
<p>An excellent emphasis, here.  If the details of this matter<br>
are to be brought forth in the London Times and elsewhere (Don&rsquo;t count on it ), it is very likely the record will reveal that a large majority of the protesting academics signing off on a letter of condemnation, did not as individuals make much, if any, effort (most suitably by email ) to communicate initially with Kanazawa and/or to seek to communicate with other academics who did NOT share the ideologically prefabricated &#8220;indignation&#8221; ostensibly fueling the letter of protest.  That there appear to be a significant number of academics who see the matter quite differently from the signatories to the letter of condemnation, surely suggests by ordinary standards of good manners that divergent views should have been engaged in an effort at reasonable discussion/disputation before a career-threatening protest letter was made public.  Deeper within their readily bleeding hearts, most such  campus lefties have a core of stony arrogance.       </p>
