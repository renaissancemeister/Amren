<h1>Henrietta Teen Arrested in Stabbing of 13-Year-Old Cousin</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Victoria E. Freile, Democrat and Chronicle, June 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Henrietta teen is accused of stabbing his 13-year-old cousin in their townhouse yesterday.</p>
<p>Cpl. John Helfer of the Monroe County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office today said Faheem Abdul-Jaleel, 16, was charged with first-degree assault, a felony. He called 911 from a security phone box at the University of Rochester&rsquo;s River Campus about 11 p.m. yesterday, more than 12 hours after his cousin Samina Qasim was found bleeding in the garage with multiple stab wounds to her chest and upper body.</p>
<p>Abdul-Jaleel was taken into custody at Kendrick and Lattimore roads without incident and allegedly admitted to stabbing his cousin in the family&rsquo;s garage yesterday morning after an argument, Helfer said. It was not known what the two argued about, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Samina&rsquo;s mother attempted to take her daughter to Strong Memorial Hospital but was intercepted en route by a Henrietta ambulance that took her the rest of the way to the hospital. The girl was in critical condition today, Helfer said.</p>

<p>My guess is his 13-year-old cousin was trying to be an American and he didn&rsquo;t like it. Sounds like another honor killing.  Or it could have been an arranged marriage gone wrong. Lots of Muslims marry their cousins. </p>
<p>Of course this is has nothing to do with Islam, Islam is peace. </p>

<p> I live in upstate New York, and I don&rsquo;t know about this particle case, but the same newspaper ran a series this past week on &#8220;refugees,&#8221; all African and almost all muslim, who were brought here by the Catholic Family Center, a supposedly-religious-based not-for-profit.  These individuals have no skills, do not speak English, most have serious health problems, and often whole families (multiple kids) are brought over as well.  The series showed the supposed good effects of the special schooling the children received.  Guess who pays for this?  Guess who supports them, pays for their health care, etc.?   No talk of their going back to Africa, either. Why people who have nothing in common with Americans or America are brought here is beyond me.  I would like to see these thoughtless do-gooder agencies either lose their not-for-profit status, or go out of business.   Another reason I don&rsquo;t give to United Way or general charites. </p>

		<p>To me it seems as if these churches as these tax exempt  businesses choose to call themselves could not care less of the burden they put on the hardworking American Taxpayers back when they do everything they can to import these throwbacks from all over the world who do not help but actually hurt America with their presence. Of course what does the church care they get that big five dollar bill in their collection plate on Sunday so the H with the  rest of the World.</p>

<p>The Churches no longer get the bulk of their money from donations.  Much of their money comes from government payments and grants for their &#8220;charitable, educational&#8221; and in the case of the Catholic church hospital and medical work.</p>
<p>Most of this is the result of Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s war on poverty legacy.  Any one who is out of work can form a non profit, get a grant and embark on the destruction of America.  The church organization that brought this savage to America is supported by federal, state, local and other grants to do this work.  For instance, organizations like the Tides, Ford, Carnegie Foundation give billions per year to organizations like the one that brought this person from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Catholic church runs about 68 percent of the hospitals in America.  That is good and should be praised and supported.  </p>
<p>The rest of the non profit sector needs to be dismantled.  All charity donations should be abolished.  Then the Pritzkers (Hyatt Hotels) would not be able to donate half a billion a year to their favorite anti White anti American organizations like President obama&rsquo;s campaign.<br>

		<p>possible explanations:<br>
he did not like that she may have been acting too &#8220;western&#8221;.<br>
he was arranged to marry her and she refused.<br>
or both.</p>
