<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In two separate incidents, as many as 15 teens have stormed Chicago Transit Authority buses, attacked their victims and darted off with cell phones and other electronic devices, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the first attack, near West Roosevelt Road and South Loomis Street at about 11:40 p.m. Saturday, a victim was struck multiple times before the thieves ran off with his cell phone.</p>
<p>About 25 minutes later, near South Racine Avenue and West 13th Street, a student said he was sitting on a No. 12 bus when as many as 15 black boys and young men boarded the bus without paying.  The student was hit in the back of his head with a glass bottle and was robbed of his iPod, said UIC police.</p>

		<p>Nobel Prize winner Dr. Albert Schweitzer made a shocking statment  FIFTY  years ago:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given my life to try to alleviate the sufferings of Africa.  There is something that all white men who have lived here like I must learn and know: that these individuals are a sub-race.  They have neither the intellectual, mental, or emotional abilities to equate or to share equally with white men in any function of our civilization.  I have given my life to try to bring them the advantages which our civilization must offer, but I have become well aware that we must retain this status: the superior and they the inferior.  </p>
<p>For whenever a white man seeks to live among them as their equals they will either destroy him or devour him.  And they will destroy all of his work.  Let white men from anywhere in the world, who would come to Africa, remember that you must continually retain this status; you the master and they the inferior like children that you would help or teach.  Never fraternize with them as equals.  Never accept them as your social equals or they will devour you.  They will destroy you.&#8221; </p>
<p>The last line above says it all&hellip;neighborhood by neighborhood, school by school, city by city, blacks are DOING it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This soon-to-be confirmed top cop says more arrests need to be made&#8221;  &mdash;  Lower caption under video screen describing the representative of CPD on the original article. </p>
<p>Approx 25-30% into the interview this soon to be annointed Chicago Top Cop refers to the &#8220;youf&#8221; activities of late in Chicago as &#8220;infractions&#8221;. What kind of alternate universe are he and the State of Illinois living in? In North Carolina, an &#8220;infraction&#8221; is something like expired inspection sticker or speeding 44 in a 35 or a burned out tail light bulb and most of the stuff in Chicago we&rsquo;ve been reading about are various misdemeanors and felonies. (mostly felonies)</p>
<p>What a feckless dolt!</p>

I am glad the news media is beginning to report the race of the criminals. Two generations after the civil rights legislation was signed it is time to stop pretending, &#8220;The real problem is not black crime. It is white racism.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
Actually, the real problem is the black crime that reinforces white racism generation after generation everywhere in the world that whites have the misfortune to live in proximity with large numbers of blacks. </p>

		<p>Keep in mind, this new police superintendent was picked by the new mayor, Rahm Emanuel, and is subservient to him. Emanuel was Obama&rsquo;s chief of staff so one can see where Emanuel&rsquo;s loyalties are, besides to himself of course.<br>
They are both tap-dancing pretty adroitly to avoid saying anything un-PC.    </p>

		<p>LOVE the Schweitzer quote in Poster #1&rsquo;s offering!!  Truer words were never spoken.  Blacks only improve when they get infused with white or Asian blood.  I&rsquo;d advise anyone who takes public transportation to carry an assisted-opening knife on them at all times.  I drive my own car, but I&rsquo;ve got 2 knives on me always, and I sleep with a .357 magnum and a .38 beside me.  I&rsquo;m an old lady - gonna be 66 in a couple of weeks - and I reserve the right to defend myself whenever, wherever, and however I need to.</p>

		<p>Re: comment #3, &#8220;the real problem is the black crime that reinforces white racism generation after generation&#8221;.  I would add not only are there a higher number of crimes as a percentage of the population by blacks, but the crimes are more violent.  These black crimes are not &#8220;economic crimes&#8221; to steal and provide for your family, these are unprovoked acts of violence.  Any many are perpetrated upon whites, where if it were reversed (white on black) it would be declared a hate crime and well covered in the press.</p>

		<p>Interesting that those &#8220;urban youths&#8221; pull that nonsense in Chicago where they know that their law-abiding victims have been rendered disarmed by the state.  Just let them try that in a state with shall-issue concealed carry laws.  They know darn well what would happen here in Texas if they acted like uncivilized thugs on a bus.  </p>
<p>An armed society is a polite society.</p>

<p>What are you saying? That we should all mate with blacks? Sounds like a new marxist ad for miscegenation.</p>
<p>NO, blacks do NOT improve when infused with White blood. I don&rsquo;t care about them infusing with Asian, hispanic blood, but NOT White blood! NEVER!</p>
<p> Look at Obama, Eric Holder, the list goes on,and tell me that they improve! In fact, they hate their &#8220;White side&#8221; even more! </p>
<p>A White woman moved into the complex where I live. She had two mulatto teenage daughters. They looked and acted just like your typical black with all black &#8220;friends&#8221; hanging around and acting like your typical blacks. Their mother ended up in jail, for what, I do not know, but then of course she was a race mixer and had the same mentality as most blacks do. They are all gone now and got evicted for the trouble they caused, thank God.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see that the article did indeed say that&hellip;but <b>the media still emphasized the &#8220;teens&#8221; angle in order to trivialize the extent of the violence, </b>which could have been fatal (E.g., being hit on the back of the head with a glass bottle).</p>

		<p>I too have been aware of the Schweitzer quote for many years having read his writings as a youth. He wrote with such authority given his work in black Africa for so many years. </p>
<p>@# 7: I agree with you 100% regarding ccw (concealed carry of a weapon). I have carried legally for decades now. I encourage all citizens to get the training and start carrying. Your very life may depend on your ability to use a gun and have it with you when you need it. This becomes much more important as the economy spirals into oblivion. We do not live in the same society we did in the &rsquo;30s and I think things will get very, very ugly as the depression deepens. Be aware and be prepared!!</p>

<p><br>
I agree with YOU! However there are places where it&rsquo;s simply NOT possible to get a concealed carry permit. What do these people then do? <br>
The truth is that one needs to get a firearm, get the proper training and carry concealed regardless of the permit. The only time that you would be discovered is a situation in which you are forced to use the gun to defend yourself and you are still alive to talk about it. Most CC owners don&rsquo;t go around calling attention to the fact that they&rsquo;re carrying nor should anyone who doesn&rsquo;t have the permit.</p>
<p>Let me repeat the need to have thorough training in the safe and responsible use of firearms. No one should buy a gun and simply carry it without training just as no one should drive a car without training. <br>
If you had to save someone&rsquo;s life by driving them to the hospital and you didn&rsquo;t have a license, you could face charges but wieghed against the fact that you saved a life would certainly be a mitigating circumstance.</p>
