<h1>Border Shootout Under Investigation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Polo Sandoval, KRGV News (Rio Grande Valley), June 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>We expect to learn more today about a shootout between drug runners and U.S. authorities near Chimney Park south of Mission. </p>
<p>Dozens of Texas state game wardens descended on Chimney Park along with Border Patrol agents and Texas Rangers. They saturated the area after a shootout between game wardens and drug smugglers.</p>
<p>Authorities in Austin have released only basic information, saying a suspicious vehicle was spotted on the U.S. side of the river around 6 Thursday morning. They then saw two cartel drug recovery boats loaded with people and what appeared to be marijuana.</p>
<p>As they approached, that&rsquo;s when gunfire broke out. Gunmen on the Mexican side opened fire on American boats. Game wardens aboard returned fire, injuring three of the smugglers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>US Senator John Cornyn has also released a statement, saying, &#8220;Despite the repeated assurances of President Obama and Secretary Napolitano that our border is secure, [this] brazen attack on law enforcement provides further evidence for what Texans already know. Cartel-related violence along our border is real and escalating, and the Administration cannot continue to deny it when American lives  &mdash;  particularly those of our law enforcement  &mdash;  are directly in harm&rsquo;s way.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We have been under attack from Mexico for decades. First, it was stealth occupation. Now, it&rsquo;s become open warfare, but this administration and several previous ones are hell bent on sending our military to the other side of the world to jump into a civil war in an area that has been a constant hotbed of struggles and will continue to be long after we leave. Get our military out of there (and I thought this long before I just said goodbye to a grandson headed that way). We need our men and women home and lined up on our southern border and surrounded by signs that say, &#8220;Just try it!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Feds want a completely porous border. The states and the citizenry do not. It is only a matter of time before some combat-grade cross-border firefight takes place with the Mexicans getting badly mauled by local forces. The Mexican government will squeal to high heaven. The Feds will crack down hard on the Americans. This will be a &#8220;teaching moment&#8221; (assuming there are still Americans capable of being roused from their drugged sleep).   </p>

		<p>The drug runners have better weapons, superior training and recent combat experience against both Federal(e) and Mercenary (DTO) forces.</p>
<p>The two game wardens, with maybe a pair of 9mms for fishing or hunting poachers and a bolt rifle for shooting stray cattle that come across the river are lucky they weren&rsquo;t slaughtered.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the Mexicans are likely sitting on anything up to several million dollars worth of illegal contraband and anything the U.S. LEOs could do to them _will not even come close_ to what they will get from their boss for losing a load.  </p>
<p>Hung upside down from a bridge and burned alive come to mind here.</p>
<p>When the enemy has grenade launchers and full auto assault weapons, you don&rsquo;t play the One Ranger, One Riot games.</p>
<p>You take several weeks, find ALL their crossing points (vehicle fords and easy landings for boats plus bushes for cover) and develop a channelization scheme, complete with your own explosives, through a likely traffic choke that several of these routes feed through.  And then you go in, without notification and set up a long watch team so that when a suitable sized target gets to the heart of the fire funnel you can pop the ambush with absolutely no mercy or warning whatsoever.</p>
<p>I truly wish some of these idiots in the DEA and ICE would post some videos of what happens to people strung out on drugs and the victims (often family members) they in turn prey upon to feed their habits before getting all holier than thou about international relations and the human rights of _drug runners on OUR LAND_.</p>
<p>You can bet your last dollar that, if this was happening in Israel, there would be some serious examples made until the bad guys decided to go make their blood money someplace else.</p>

		<p>Mexicans are a new voting base. Only winning elections count, not the country. Easy to figure out huh? </p>

		<p>Pretty sad that it wasn&rsquo;t the Border Patrol (who&rsquo;s job it is to protect our borders) but GAME WARDENS who fired back at the smugglers (and actually got three of them)</p>
