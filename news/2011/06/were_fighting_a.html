			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alasdair Palmer, Telegraph (London), June 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seventy per cent of applications for asylum in the UK are rejected. But only one in 10 of those who apply for asylum here will be deported. Although some of the failed asylum seekers go home voluntarily, most of the rest end up staying. Whatever you think about whether we grant too many people asylum, that represents a defeat for the system  &mdash;  and a defeat for the rule of law.</p>
<p>The law says that most of those who settle here after applying for asylum should not be allowed to stay. But stay they do  &mdash;  and after about five years, their initially illegal settlement is endorsed by both the state and the courts. That&rsquo;s why, last week, the Home Affairs Select Committee condemned the situation as &#8220;indefensible&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t the law being enforced? Part of the answer is that we are not very good at keeping tabs on people once they have lodged a claim for asylum. About 20 per cent of the 403,500 people who have applied over the past decade have disappeared: no government official knows whether they have stayed or left the UK. But in asylum&rsquo;s upside-down world, that&rsquo;s &#8220;resolving&#8221; their claim.</p>
<p>Our asylum law is also full of loopholes, the biggest of which has been made by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights: our old friend, the &#8220;right to family life&#8221;. If you seek asylum, and you manage to have children here, you gain the right to stay: the children are entitled to live here because they were born here, and the state does not have the right to separate you from them, which is what would happen if it sent you back to your country of origin.</p>
<p>Senior officials at the UK Border Agency, the government organisation responsible for policing immigration and asylum, tell me that the right to family life is the reason why tens of thousands of asylum seekers have been granted leave to remain here permanently without any contest  &mdash;  even though it believes their asylum claims are bogus. There hasn&rsquo;t, as the Select Committee suggested, been a decision to grant a general amnesty. It is simply that the agency&rsquo;s lawyers have looked at the cases of those who have had children while in Britain, and decided that there&rsquo;s no point in going to court: the Government would lose. So there has been a pragmatic decision to throw in the towel.</p>
<p>Anyway, going through the legal procedures can sometimes take years without reaching a definitive conclusion. Ruling on an asylum case in the Court of Appeal in April, Lord Justice Ward said that &#8220;I shake my head in despair, if not disbelief, at this extraordinary process, which occupies so much court time.&#8221; His despair is understandable: the woman at the centre of the case had first sought the right to settle in Britain a decade ago. Her claim was rejected, but she then switched to claiming asylum.</p>
<p>That, too, was rejected, but it slowly worked its way through the maze of appeals until it reached Lord Justice Ward  &mdash;  who found that he could not resolve it either, but had to send it back to an asylum and immigration tribunal. Which means, as he ruefully observed, &#8220;another hearing, and more expenditure of public money on legal costs on both sides, probably with more appeals to follow&#8221;. The woman hasn&rsquo;t yet gained the right to stay here. But she&rsquo;s gained the right to fight her case, which turns out to be a pretty good equivalent.</p>
<p>The UK Border Agency may have finally got the backlog of asylum cases under control. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it has asylum seekers under control. Manifestly, it has not. Claiming asylum remains the best hope that someone hoping to escape the misery, poverty and corruption of a developing nation has of gaining residence in Britain. So we can expect the numbers coming here, whose claims are without merit, to rise  &mdash;  and for it to be impossible to enforce the law in all but a minority of cases.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t impossible to make the system work, but it will require an enormous commitment of money and manpower, and possibly a major change to the way the law operates. In these constrained times, is that really likely to happen?</p>

<p>Because Britain&rsquo;s liberals and neo-liberals (some call them &#8220;conservatives&#8221;) don&rsquo;t want immigration law enforced.  Simple as that.  You&rsquo;ll be amazed to find out how well a law is followed when it is dutifully and universally enforced.  To wit:  The income tax.</p>

		<p>What will happen if Europe fills up with Muslim immigrants and turns into a dysfunctional hell hole like all the other Muslim countries?  Perhaps then no further asylum seekers will come, because Europe will be no better than Africa.  </p>

		<p>Strangely enough the Immigration Act of 1981 altered Britain&rsquo;s traditional jus solis (ie citiznship is granted to all those born on British soil) to jus sanguis (citizenship is conferred by blood or descent).<br>
  This was a rare act of British ministerial competence, designed to pre-empt a massive wave of sub-con immigration.<br>
 Evidentally it has proved useless.</p>

		<p>The British people need to call their government to heel and demand their representatives put their needs above those of foreigners. In otherwords, simply deport them all. Yes, I know it&rsquo;s easier said than done. But it must be done.</p>

<p>As long as there is food to eat, land to be occupied, and opportunities to be looked after by whites they will come.</p>
<p>A future Third World Europe could be turned into a patchwork of walled fortresses and gated communities, similar to the castle-ization which occurred after the fall of the Roman Empire. </p>
<p>Whites would be unsafe outside their compounds.</p>

		<p>Given that Great Britain is an island, and that few would-be illegal immigrants/bogus asylum seekers, etc., are capable of swimming the English Channel, it should be the simplest thing in the world for our ruling elites to secure our borders here.</p>
<p>The cost? Well, they&rsquo;re able to find it to dish out the very generous welfare payments that lure most of the immigrants in the first place (even if this is offset by doing their best to deny it to the indigenous unemployed), not to mention bailing out the crooked banks and fighting pointless wars.</p>
<p>The political will just isn&rsquo;t there. I wonder why?</p>
