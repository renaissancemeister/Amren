<h1>Ala. Governor Signs Tough Illegal Immigration Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Johnson, Yahoo! News, June 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Alabama&rsquo;s governor on Thursday signed a tough new illegal immigration crackdown that contains provisions requiring public schools to determine students&rsquo; immigration status and making it a crime to knowingly give an illegal immigrant a ride.</p>
<p>The bill also allows police to arrest anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant if they&rsquo;re stopped for any other reason. Alabama employers also are now required to use a federal system called E-Verify to determine if new workers are in the country legally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mary Bauer, said Thursday that she expects a lawsuit to be filed before the provisions of law are scheduled to take effect on Sept. 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clearly unconstitutional. It&rsquo;s mean-spirited, racist and we think a court will enjoin it,&#8221; Bauer said.</p>

		<p>Just a reminder that the 5-3 decision by the U. S. Supreme Court known (U. S. Chamber of Commerce vs. Whiting) in May upholding Arizona&rsquo;s Legal Arizona Worker&rsquo;s Act (LAWA) opens the way for Alabama and any other state to ensure illegal immigrants are not illegally employed.</p>
<p>LAWA mandates that all Arizona employers use E-Verify, a free, fast, very-easy-to-use federal software program that checks a worker&rsquo;s information against Homeland Security and Social Security databases. LAWA also allows Arizona to strip business licenses of employers who intentionally employ illegal aliens, after a second violation.</p>
<p>Whether the additional provisions in Alabama law will survive a court challenge remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Footnote: The five judges in the Whiting majority supporting Arizona were appointed by Republican presidents.  The dissenting justices were appointed by Democrat presidents, illustrating the role Presidential elections play shaping social policy via judicial appointments. <br>

		<p>I fail to see how this law is &#8220;racist&#8221; when I see NO mention of anyone racial makeup or ethic type. If this law is &#8220;mean-spirited&#8221; then ALL laws are mean to the violators. It clearly shows the people are growing tired of the crimes being committed by these illegals and the burden they place on our citizens.</p>

		<p>Post-1965 Immigration Policy is racist because the intent of the policy is to reduce the Native Born White American Majority-without the consent of the Native Born White American Majority-to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America where they will be surrounded by a very rapidly increasing high fertility,hostile and heavily armed post-1965 nonwhite population. And since the SPLC are fanatical supporters of post-1965 immigration policy, the SPLC is a hard-core antiwhite racist organization.</p>

		<p>The people that work for SPLC are just down the street from the capitol in Montgomery and can see what&rsquo;s going at all times. This group was placed here by the blessings of Jimmy Carter to watch Alabama and to try to influence the legislators to promote their liberal cause.They will sue the state at the drop of a hat and make racial issues over the most trivial things. This is their job and they have been doing it for years. Alabama is a poor state and cannot afford to build new schools and provide free medical at our emergency rooms for the thousands of illegals that have invaded us. The SPLC said they are preparing to sue us and the court cost will cost millions. They will make a race thing out of it and we will probably lose as the U.S. media will be attacking us as they have for years.</p>

		<p>Notice the comments the $PLC made:  &#8220;mean-spirited&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; are the two over-used, ultimatley meaningless terms endlessly used by liberals to label anything they don&rsquo;t like. Good for Alabama!  I hated one city there when I lived in that state, but to their credit, many white Alabamians are race-realists.  As for the $PLC, with thier inane knee-jerk comments, they continue to lose credibility.</p>

		<p> Alabama should steal a march on the SPLC and file a lawsuit against it before it can file its own lawsuit. As long as groups like this one and the NAACP are allowed to get away with their aggressive, drive-by litigator tactics, they&rsquo;ll keep doing it. Pile the lawsuits onto them until they&rsquo;re drowning in them, and they&rsquo;ll have to spend all their time   &mdash;   and money   &mdash;   defending themselves instead of causing trouble for other people.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t see why this is so hard for individuals, groups and governmental entities to understand. Other posters, as well as myself, have advocated this course of action repeatedly on this site. Anyone who thinks the state of Alabama couldn&rsquo;t find a lawyer   &mdash;   or a bunch of them   &mdash;   who could find a legitimate reason for suing the SPLC, doesn&rsquo;t know lawyers.</p>

		<p>You see, the problem with the right today is they refuse to recognize that all the issues they address stem from the question of Race.  If everyone on the political right today got together and hammered and hammered the race issue, it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before the entire 70% white majority vote would go with it. But is it worth speculating?</p>

		<p>6 Anonymous:</p>
<p>I have been part of a protest against the SPLC in front of their HQ in Montgomery, and here&rsquo;s what I took away from the optics:</p>
<p>1.  Montgomery is a city of graceful old buildings, especially in the public sector.  By contrast, the SPLC&rsquo;s newer building looks to be some tacky gawdy museum of post-modern art, and an unusually tall one for that city.  I think the only taller building in Montgomery, from ground to top, is the AmSouth Bank Building.  The only Montgomery edifice you can see from any appreciable distance from the city.  The top of the State Capitol is probably higher in elevation than the top of the SPLC building, only because the Capitol is based on top of a hill (Goat Hill).  That the SPLC chose such an ostentatious and vertically tall design I think was an example of &#8220;showing its ahem off&#8221; to the city it knows is none too fond of its presence.</p>
<p>2.  Within the same square block, the SPLC occupies the southern half.  Most of the northern half is occupied by a building that serves as the HQ of the Alabama National Education Association.  You really can&rsquo;t get two more like peas in the same pod.</p>

		<p>If the governor truly believes in the cause of immigration restriction and he is not just playing politics, then he should continue to take the offensive. Strike while the iron is hot. Most of the people, even if only the conservative whites, agree with the governor who has just been called racist. Talk about poking a stick into the hornet&rsquo;s nest. Respond but be smart about it. I wouldn&rsquo;t even bother responding to the SPLC. After all their main job is provocation, misdirection and dragging debate into the mud. Provocation is a good idea but force it yourself now that you have the numbers of supporters. There is a bigger battle to be fought. Go after the sociology professors. But it has to be done indirectly. They are too strong in their college fortress. Challenge them through your government workers who are affiliated to professional sociology associations. At present these professional workers are taught that science is opposed to immigration restriction. This has been the direction of sociology and offshoots in anthropology, social work, and cultural studies. Require that government workers in these trades take a debunking course as part of their professional development. This becomes a threat to the sociology professors as it contests their theories as being political and not scientific. They are afraid of that debate more than anything else.  </p>

		<p>The SPLC is about one thing..and one thing only. Money.<br>
Every political stance, every cause, every ideal that the SPLC<br>
announces begins with t Marketing Plan. If the SPLC wants<br>
to target a population or a region for donations..it<br>
invents a &#8220;Hate Group&#8221; in that area. If hispanics in Chicago are<br>
lagging in donations the SPLC will &#8220;discover&#8221; that the Minutemen<br>
have opened a branch in the Chicago suburbs. From here begins<br>
the targetting mass mailings, which are Morris Dees specialty.<br>
When Obama came to office SPLC was instrumental in gettign <br>
White Militias denounced by the DHS as #1 security threat to the USA. The net effect was millions more dollars to the SPLC coffers which now stand at $220,000,000. The SPLC has a &#8220;F&#8221; charity rating..another secret. SPLC is one of the most successful con games in history. Period.</p>

SPLC trashes anti-racist legislation </p>
<p>A representative of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has attacked Alabama&rsquo;s new anti-racist legislation as &#8220;clearly unconstitutional&#8221; and &#8220;mean-spirited.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Bauer, legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, predicted the courts would enjoin the new law.</p>
<p>White people in Alabama have suffered from an increase of illegal aliens, most of whom are Hispanic, in recent years. 120,000 illegal aliens live in Alabama, nearly fivefold increase from a decade ago.</p>
<p>The law also protects illegal aliens from human smuggling.</p>
<p>Alabama lawmakers have been praised for their bold step in stemming the illegal Hispanic invasion that threatens their economy, culture and heritage.<br>

		<p> I find it interesting that an organization that has the word poverty in it&rsquo;s name is promoting that condition in the very people they claim to serve. With a unemployment rate just north of 9% and some 10 to 12 million illegals in this country you think someone would make the connection between the very high unemployment rate in the non-white community and the illegal immigrates. The illegal immigrates are taking up the low-skill and no-skill jobs that should be going to American citizens. Some American-Hispanics are losing their jobs to the illegals. This is basic economics; if you create a labor surplus, you cause wages to decline and unemployment to rise.</p>

		<p>these laws discriminate against illegal immigrants just like laws against murder and assault discriminate against all violent criminals who want to be able to do those things. how DARE we want to stop criminals? shouldn&rsquo;t we think of their feelings?</p>
<p>in all seriousness, if these illegal immigrants think that the US is so racist and terrible, perhaps they should go home?</p>

<p>So we are expanding now to take in all non-whites? </p>
<p>Is it not racist to hate and despise whites along with their culture heritage religion? </p>

		<p>Here in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, crime committed by illegals has become a major problem. Although they are only about 1% of the population, they committed half the murders in our county last year, and two of those were beating their own children to death. Also a beautiful young high school girl was killed by a drunken speeding illegal who ran a red light only a few blocks from our home.</p>
<p>Several years ago a local college professor was visiting in Florida where they need the same law down. She was decapitated by a concrete block dropped from an interstate overpass by an illegal who was a gang member.</p>

		<p>SPLC founder Morris Dees is a real piece of work. Back in the 70s and early 80s he often visited our town. He bounced a small check at a local restaurant and NEVER made it good. For many years the check was on display at the restaurant&rsquo;s counter for all to see. It had been redeposited several times and was covered with NSF stamps.</p>
<p>Of course this little cafe was white owned. He would never have done that to a &#8220;minority&#8221; business.</p>

		<p>If a law, or any action, against immigration is racist, thats an upfront admission that immigration itself is racist. That is, more of some groups are immigrating than others. How else could opposition to it be considered racism? Immigration is obviously upsetting the all important &#8216;racial balance&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a from of &#8216;Ethnic cleaning&rsquo;, all that sort of thing. </p>

		<p>There are so many organized groups, with such &#8220;wonderful sounding&#8221; names, that are permeated with socialists, marxists and illuminists whose sole goal in life is the complete radical transformation of this country. They are wolves among the sheep. By infiltrating and destroying every foundation of our nation  &mdash;  -marriage, the family unit, education, history, religious worship, free enterprise  &mdash;  -the Republic which our forefathers bequeathed unto us has become an entitled mass of self-serving ethnic groups and brainwashed automatons. This deceitful group is a prime example. They act on the surface to be champions of the people, all the while working tirelessly to eradicate what is truly good and replace it with the opposite. The Apostle Paul said it clearly, &#8221; In the last days, evil will be called good, and good will be called evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>This fastball almost whizzed passed me.  I guess the SPLC, a building full of lawyers, thought they were trying to pull a fast one over on us with semantics.  &#8220;We think a court will ENJOIN it.&#8221;  &#8220;Enjoin&#8221; is the verb form of the noun &#8220;injunction,&#8221; meaning temporarily putting on hold, in the context of the judicial branch of government.  That parts of this AL immigration law will be &#8220;enjoined&#8221; at some point in the judicial process is almost a 100% given.  But that&rsquo;s not the end game, the end game is the constitutionality proceedings.  I don&rsquo;t want to have to rant about the difference again.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple.  The $PLC is rolling in money, well over $100 million of it, some of it stashed away in the Cayman Islands.  A modest 5% return means that without any donations at all they&rsquo;d have $5 million a year to spend on salaries.  That pays for a good many Mark Potoks and Heidi Beiriches.<br>

		<p>If the law shows promise of being too effective, it certainly will be challenged and defeated in court. </p>
<p>Left wingers never give up, remember that. This will go to court over and over again. Petitions will be signed, law makers will be harassed and on and on.</p>
<p>We know how they operate and people cannot ever let their guard down.  </p>

		<p>Every time someone says &#8220;racist&#8221;, &#8220;bigot&#8221;, &#8220;Nazi&#8221; or any other word meant to try to shut you up, respond by copying an article from here that speaks of non-white on white violence, immigrant abuse of our programs, immigrant trash like the river they destroyed in New York, any and all immigrant crime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I started doing on Politico and it shuts them immediately.  They sliter away like the snakes they are when you respond with facts about them.</p>
<p>And yes, Amren, I cite you.</p>
