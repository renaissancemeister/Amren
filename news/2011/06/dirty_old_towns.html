			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), June 14, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cities like New York, Miami, Las Vegas and Los Angeles may be some of the most popular and exciting cities in the U.S., but they also happen to be the dirtiest.</p>
<p>A list of the filthiest cities in America has been compiled by Travel and Leisure magazine.</p>
<p>Most of the places that made the top ten were some of the most popular in all of the country, perhaps something to do with the number of tourists who frequent there or the street parties and events that attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.</p>
<p>New Orleans, for example, which was voted the number one dirtiest city in the U.S., is known for its yearly Mardi Gras, the clean up of which is of epic proportions.</p>
<p>That, added with the fact that the effects of Hurricane Katrina can still be seen in some places, sent this city to the top spot.</p>
<p>The top ten was chosen by Travel and Leisure readers who took things such as litter, air pollution and even the taste of local tap water into consideration.</p>
<p>But that did not mean that they were cities they did not like as some of the top ten also ranked high in favouritie cities list.</p>
<p>Atlanta ad executive Patrick Scullin, for example, loves Baltimore  &mdash;  but not because it is particularly pristine. </p>
<p>He told the magazine: &#8216;Yes, there&rsquo;s litter, smokers, and graffiti. But that&rsquo;s just life going on. The air sometimes offends, but a cool breeze off the harbour can ease all worries. It&rsquo;s a gem of a city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Las Vegas and Miami, which took the number seven and eight spots respectively, were ranked high on things like having a great bar scene, live music or great for people watching as well as being thought of as dirty.</p>
<p>Los Angeles, which is famous for its smog and traffic-clogged streets, took the number three spot for the third year in a row.</p>
<p>New York has cleaned up its act a bit. Last year it took the number one spot but has moved down to number five. But it took the top spot on the list of most expensive U.S. cities.</p>
<p><br/>

		<p>Maybe these numbers have something to do with it?<br/>
1. New Orleans 60.2% black, 5,3% hispanic<br/>
2. Philadelphia 42.5% black, 11.4% hispanic<br/>
3. Los Angeles 9.6% black, 48.5% hispanic<br/>
4. Memphis 62.6% black, 29.5% hispanic<br/>
5. New York 27% black, 27% hispanic<br/>
6. Baltimore  65.2% black 3% hispanic<br/>
7. Las Vegas  11.1 % black, 31.5% hispanic<br/>
8. Miami 19.2% black, 72.6% hispanic<br/>
9. Atlanta  54% black, 35.3% hispanic<br/>
10. Houston 28.7% black, 25.6% hispnic</p>
<p>Where ever you find a Mexican you find Mexico = dirt diapers, public defecation.</p>
<p>Blacks are just lazy. Walk by a market in a black hood and there will be 100s of plastic shopping bags on the ground right outside the store. As soon as they pull the item out of the bag, they drop the bag. They have a odd mentality that whitey will clean up after them.</p>

<p>Santa Monica, Bel Air, Pacific Palisades and Holmby Hills are on the very White side of the city - &#8220;West LA&#8221;. </p>
<p>I am a lifelong Angeleno and I was surprised to see LA listed on here also. </p>
<p>The formerly black ghettos of South LA, Compton, Watts, Inglewood, Westchester, Wilmington are turning into Hispanic barrios. Most of the city&rsquo;s black population is gone now, having left the state or retreating 60 miles out to Riverside, Moreno Valley and Lancaster.</p>
<p>Say what you want about Hispanics, but they are breathing new life into the formerly decrepit and black parts of South LA, Compton, Watts, Inglewood, Westchester, Wilmington. I have also noticed that Hispanic have a sense of pride in their homes and tend to keep them clean and landscaped - something the former black occupants couldn&rsquo;t do? </p>
<p>Crime is also way down in LA too! </p>
<p>There are lots of new White/Caucasian immigrants in LA now. Lots of Persians around Beverly Hills, Armenians in Glendale, North Hollywood and Van Nuys, Russians in Encino, Sherman Oaks and Reseda. </p>
<p>Santa Monica has always had a thriving British ex-patriot community and continues to attract European tourists all year. </p>
<p>Central LA is now half Asian/half Hispanic, as is most of the southern part of the San Gabriel Valley. Again, though, most Asians and Hispanics take care of their property and are generally good populations. </p>
<p>The suburbs surrounding LA to the northwest (Simi Valley, Moorpark, Conejo Valley and Santa Clarita Valley) all remain highly Caucasian and crime-free. </p>
<p>The place to avoid in the LA Region, again, is San Bernardino and Moreno Valley. </p>
<p>Lancaster used to have issues but they are supposedly in the process of cleaning up the Section 8 mess there and making it livable again. Time will tell. </p>
<p>LA is probably the only city on this &#8220;dirty&#8221; list that I would bother to live in, and trust me, I have visited them all! <br/>

<p>What kind of a drug is this guy on?  BaltiMORGUE is an absolute dump.  There&rsquo;s literally a 4 block by 4 block radius (near Inner Harbor) that you can walk through and maybe not get mugged.  Immediately surrounding the &#8220;touristy&#8221; Inner Harbor is Black ghetto after Black ghetto after Black ghetto.  North, South, East, West. I don&rsquo;t care which direction you travel&hellip;you are bound to find crime and decay.</p>

		<p>New Orleans was nasty long, long before Katrina. Even if it is not Mardi Gras season, there will be tons of litter, occasional pools of vomit, and the ever present stench of mildewed urine. Plus the locals spit everywhere. Where I grew up it was illegal to spit on the ground in public.</p>
<p>The cleanest city I have even been to is Hong Kong. Everywhere there are signs warning the public that it is a $2000HK fine for spitting or urinating in public. That&rsquo;s equivalent to about $250US. You cannot even spit in the trash cans.</p>

		<p>My father recently took my mother to Walgreens to have a prescription filled. He waited outside listening to the radio. While my mother was inside a black woman walked in front of his car drinking a soda and just tossed the empty cup on the ground. Then she looked around and realized my dad had seen her. So she walked back, picked it up and looking right at him threw it down again. My dad was just sitting there. He hadn&rsquo;t said anything or changed his expression. What can you say to something like that? Do you want to know why Memphis is filthy? There ya go. I&rsquo;m just surprised three cities beat Memphis. I demand a recount!</p>

		<p>@Irish in Paris:  You named the wealthiest area in L.A. (Bel Air) and Santa Monica, a separate city from L.A.  I suspect you were also going for Beverly Hills (another separate city) or possibly Holmby Hills or the Hollywood Hills.   In any case, neighborhoods with hills in L.A. are considerably better off than the flat neighborhoods, which are most of the city.  The evaluation was based on the city overall, not the best neighborhoods.  </p>
<p>Most of L.A. has polluted air, high crime, dirty streets (not much rain), and even decrepit graffiti-covered RIVERS.  The tap water is brought hundreds of miles down an aqueduct.  Any index that includes air pollution is going to give L.A. a bad rating.</p>
<p>Glad you were able to confine yourself to the upscale Westside.  For a taste of how most Angelenos live, visit the south side (going from black to Hispanic with just short of ethnic cleansing), the east side (completely unassimilated Hispanic   &mdash;   you can go miles in any direction and think you&rsquo;re in Mexico), or even some of the seedier parts of the San Fernando Valley.</p>

<p>That &#8220;very nice hilly area&#8221; was probably Palos Verdes  &mdash;   a very exclusive, very wealthy White/Asian enclave.</p>
<p>You were in the Whitest, cleanest, safest and nicest parts of LA.</p>
<p>If you had visited South Central, parts of East LA, the Griffith Park picnic or beach areas late on a Sunday afternoon, you would have seen plenty of trash!  More than you could imagine   &mdash;   graffiti too of the most vile sort.</p>
<p>But, if you do choose to visit those areas to check out LA&rsquo;s &#8220;filth in the hood&#8221;, lock your car doors, make sure your gas tank is full and your cell phone charged; don&rsquo;t stop and only travel during daylight hours.  And don&rsquo;t get out to take pictures! They may be the last ones you ever take&hellip;</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t even <i>think</i> of walking barefoot on a Southern California beach!  You&rsquo;re more likely than not to step on either a dirty diaper or broken Corona bottle.</p>

<p>Are you kidding?  Did you even go downtown or get off any of the exits in Los Angeles or did you just stay in the nicer parts of Bel Air and Santa Monica which aren&rsquo;t even part of Los Angeles.  The only way I could describe it is it looked like the border towns in Mexico I&rsquo;ve visited while vacationing in Arizona.</p>

		<p>Irish, you seem to have been on the upscale west side of the city, or in the case of Santa Monica, a separate city. To see the underside of Los Angeles you must go inland. The south-central region is da&rsquo; Hood (race ipsa loquitur), and to the east is el Barrio (a  bit of ole Mexico).</p>

		<p>Apparently diversity has downsides as well as reported benefits.  Using a trash can is not be a cultural attribute for some groups.  Curious as these groups often have the highest unemployment and crime rates.  Could it be personal irresponsibility is the issue for these common conditions and not economic repression?</p>

		<p>Dear Irish,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you had such a wonderful time in LA.  But those of us who live here see other parts of it, parts the tourists do not see.  The area I live in was once a nice, middle-class community but is now strewn with rubbish, graffiti, abandoned shopping carts, rusty old cars on lawns, etc. because of the illegal aliens who have flooded in.</p>

		<p>Those who are closer in number of generations to a paleolithic way of life are more likely to litter. Stone age hunters were always on the move, so they did not need to clean up after themselves. </p>

<p>Yes. And you may apply that to any city that has a sizeable Mau Mau population. Center City is nice but don&rsquo;t go 20 blocks North, South or West. Go East and you&rsquo;ve got a beautiful view of Camden which actually WAS a nice town many moons ago. <br/>

<p>I live outside the D.  Lived in the D for 30 yrs before being displaced like a war refugee.</p>
<p>Much of Detroit is vacant lots.  Granted there is trash and heaping empty buildings filled with asbestos insulation and lead paint.  Not sure why the D was not on the list.  Maybe they were looking at all the beautiful vacant lots which now have prairie grass and young forests growing on them.  <br/>

<p>I remember driving by a West LA park late on a summer Sunday afternoon.  I forget the park, I think it was the one near the 405 and Palms blvd in the heart of affluent White West Los Angeles.  The trash cans and dumpsters overflowed.  The ground was actually covered with trash.  The reason was all the hispanics living 15 people to a 2 bedroom apartment had gone to the park to spend Sunday.</p>
<p>The apartments and houses were never meant to house 20 people in a 1,500 sq ft house.  The parks were never designed to accommodate such a huge population.</p>
<p>Then there was the time I went swimming on a saturday afternoon in the Culver city park.  On my way out I saw 2 pairs of legs sticking out from a dumpster.  It was 2 mexicans &#8220;making love&#8221;</p>
<p>Irish in Paris probably never went east of Robinson blvd.</p>
<p>Sunset Blvd goes from lovely to horrible in just a few blocks when it gets to that mexican neighborhood near downtown. </p>
