<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Young black and Latino men lag behind their contemporaries in nearly every measure of educational attainment, with many failing to attend college or earn degrees and large numbers facing the prospect of unemployment or incarceration.</p>
<p>The findings are included in two reports released at a briefing Monday by the College Board Advocacy &amp; Policy Center. It was hosted by Harvard University&rsquo;s W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
<p>The reports cull census data, academic research and in-depth interviews to paint a bleak picture of the educational experiences of young men across four racial and ethnic groups: African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Latinos and Native Americans.</p>
<p>Among the findings:</p>
<p>• 28% of African American men and 16% of Latino men aged 25 to 34 had obtained an associate&rsquo;s degree or higher, compared with 70% of Asian American men and 44% of white men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>• Incarceration rates are increasing  &mdash;  10% of black men aged 15-24 were incarcerated, as were 5% of Latinos and 3% of Asian Americans and Native Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The reports suggests that improving outcomes for young men of color must become a national priority and calls for community, business and school partnerships to provide mentoring and support.</p>

<p>Just where does this leave young White men, who are the only race of men NOT included when one speaks of &#8220;men of color&#8221;. I guess inclusion is not necessary in this instance. Unless you count those forged to foot the bill.</p>

<p>So we are to believe that nearly 1/3 of black men between 25 and 34 have a minimum of an associates degree?</p>

		<p>The headline about Black and hispanic students &#8220;falling behind&#8221; implies that this is a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>The fact is they&rsquo;ve always been behind whites and Asians and it&rsquo;s mostly genetic.</p>

		<p>Notice that the criterion these edumacators use for education is what academic degree has been attained. In other words, how much work has been provided to the edumacators. For at least 80% of the population, 10 to 12 years of schooling is adequate. This is the way it used to be, when America was a prosperous &amp; successful country, and when Blacks were productive &amp; law abiding citizens.</p>

		<p>Blame me.</p>
<p>If only I had done more to atone for the sins of segregation by holding myself accountable to people of color for my unearned White privileges, and if I had renounced systemic bias and institutionalized racism that perpetuates the oppressive inequities that are obstacles to social and restorative justice, and if I would just take another Implicit Racism test and submit to NAACP therapy, we wouldn&rsquo;t be facing this crisis.  Instead, we&rsquo;d all be marveling at the inventions of genius that African American males all hold in their imaginations but are stunted from expressing because of my racism.</p>
<p>Blame me.  Go ahead, because I&rsquo;m the only plausible (allowable) excuse you&rsquo;ve got.<br>

		<p>  The SCLC is holding another series of Stop the Violence marches.  They were interviewed on TV about how bad things were it their community and they just weren&rsquo;t taking it anymore.</p>
<p>I agree with them, but since I&rsquo;m a Whitey, that makes me a racist. I&rsquo;d better just keep quiet about black violence, because speaking out about a social emergency will get me fired from my job.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be tempted to turn off the TV and not watch the news, but that would also make me a racist.   All the reporters and anchors are now black, so if I don&rsquo;t watch, that makes me a racist.</p>
<p>To be an anti-racist Whitey, you must WANT to see only blacks on your TV and to keep in on all the time. But you can&rsquo;t notice the stories when blacks interview other blacks about black crime.<br>

<p>Oh brother! Here we go again, another National Priority crisis regarding &#8220;young men of color&#8221;. Let&rsquo;s see; busing didn&rsquo;t work, mainstreaming didn&rsquo;t work, racially specific teachers and classrooms didn&rsquo;t work, desegregation didn&rsquo;t work, minority studies didn&rsquo;t work, doctoring test scores didn&rsquo;t work, millions of dollars thrown at failing schools didn&rsquo;t work, charter schools didn&rsquo;t work, promotion at all costs didn&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;d think by now that the obvious would surface and the blame would be placed where it belongs. There are no more angles left to approach this problem. But never fear! The poindexters at Harvard will find another way to prioritize black and brown failure&hellip;and white students will be the first to suffer.</p>

		<p>Maybe they should pull up their pants, show up for class, and be more respectful to the teachers.  The results suggest they should show more humility  and less swaggar.</p>
<p>But, of course, the liberal spin will be they need to do nothing and society must spend more money on them.   Society has failed them &hellip;.</p>

		<p>There are lies, damned lies and then there are statistics and the above article is a perfect example. In the US Census, Pacific Islanders and Asians are classed as one. I would suggest they be counted seperately, I believe the one goes to jail and the other to college.</p>
<p>Even the figures for the American graduates are misleading in so far as they they equate a college degree in singing &#8220;Kumbaya&#8221;, gender politics or belly dancing  with a Phd. in engineering. In that last one the racial disparaties are even further apart, three black out of 100. Yet when it comes to the job market, those three will demand a proportionate share of jobs, not the three per cent that graduated but the 12% that entered the pool.<br>
What this basically means is that they have four times chance of a white, a rate of discrimination that was barely seen in the Jim Crow days. In South Africa they are at least honest about it, to enter the University of Cape Town medical school you have to have high school marks of at least 70% if you are black  (unless you happen to be closely related to a politician) but a minimum of 90% if you are white.</p>

		<p>As I was writing my last comment I wondered how the university of Cape Town is getting on, luckily I found an article in the New York Times, Nov. 2010 that has all the details.</p>
<p>The last 20 years of freedom, liberty and the rosy rainbow that has spread over South Africa has reduced the white population to 9%. White population 1950 -3 million -1980 5 million - 2010 4 million. Black 5 -20 - 40. Rabbits and lemmings spring to mind. One would think that with all the impediments and obstacles in their path the white students at this once prestigious University would be extinct. Not quite. Whites: 45% Blacks: 25%. The rest must be Indians and mixed. More depressing news for the government, only about half the blacks versus 80% of the whites graduate.</p>
<p>Let the above study study these facts. Here a government has gone out of its way to mentor, to support their own people over and above all others to the absolute limit and the results are the same. You cannot make a silk purse out of a sows ear. Ancient history. Learn it.</p>

		<p>According to Charles Murray most Americans get more education than they are capable of benefiting from. If you pour a pint of water into a cup you waste a cup of water. <br>
 <br>
Just because college graduates are less likely to become violent street criminals does not mean that increasing college enrollment will reduce the crime rate. Basketball players tend to be tall, but no one suggests that playing basketball makes people tall. <br>

		<p>We are told: The problem is institutionalized racism. The only possible solution would be spending more money on these poor, deprived, oppressed people. We need higher teachers salaries, more union officials, more programs with warm fuzzy names, more ethnic studies, more minority teachers, higher spending budgets lowering the bar on achievement, and more levels of management.</p>
<p>Of course that will mean higher taxes but come on, it&rsquo;s for the kids and we have to give to the &#8220;less fortunate&#8221; until it hurts even more than it does now.</p>
<p>People cannot be held accountable for their actions nor should they suffer the consequences of their poor choices.</p>
<p>And the reason Asians minorities do so well is because..well, it&rsquo;s because &hellip;uh..uh..actually. Well, the liberals haven&rsquo;t come up with a good slogan and chant for that one yet but give them some time and they will.</p>

<p>You can give &#8216;em all the mentoring and support in the world but that&rsquo;s not gonna change what has been ordained by nature. A hefty percentage of black and mestizo men posses very low intelligence and it&rsquo;s simply because of how their brains are hardwired. All the interventions in the world aren&rsquo;t going to change that. Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s business as usual in this country. </p>

<p>WRONG! Improving the outcomes for &#8220;young men of color&#8221; must be a priority for those young men of color, if that doesn&rsquo;t happen, nothing will work! What these so called &#8220;experts&#8221; on &#8220;African&#8221;-Americans fail to see is that it is precisely this sort of coddling of these thugs - oops - &#8220;young men of color&#8221; by them that has created this situation in the first place. Haven&rsquo;t we already been doing this &#8220;community, business, school partnerships, mentoring and support&#8221; thing for decades now? Are blacks better off now than then? Now they want to do MORE of the same? Anyone here on this site could run circles around these &#8216;race experts&rsquo;. We also have alot of &#8220;census data, academic research and in depth interviews that paints a bleak picture&#8221;, but not the kind Harvard would like to look at I&rsquo;m sure. <br>
 And what the heck is this &#8220;College Board Advocacy &amp; Policy Center&#8221;? What do THEY do? I&rsquo;d really like to just walk in there and see for myself, wouldn&rsquo;t you? And I wonder how much this &#8220;center&#8221; and this &#8220;study&#8221; adds to the &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; bill!</p>

<p>A National Priority, huh? So, after decades of &#8220;desegregation&#8221; and bussing, affirmative action, adjusting test scores, etc., still no progress of that front. Maybe it&rsquo;s a case of trying to teach pigs to sing. It wastes your time and annoys the pig.</p>
<p>How about we make unemployment a National Priority? The out of control national debt? Reliance on foreign energy? Nuclear proliferation? Islamic terrorism? The list of the pending disasters coming our way is long. The underperformance of &#8220;young men of color&#8221; is NOT a national priority. And what exactly are the causes of this underperformance? Bad schools? We have plenty of those. But we&rsquo;ve bussed them to the best schools with no noticeable improvement. Culturally skewed performance metrics? We have adjusted those until they are nearly meaningless. There are two reasons only why people don&rsquo;t make the grade: they can&rsquo;t or they won&rsquo;t. Won&rsquo;t can be fixed. Can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p>Mentoring and support? What about tickets to, hmm, Madagascar? Possibly Tasmania or Guadalcanal. These guys don&rsquo;t have the IQ, the work ethic, the sense of cause-effect, any tool whatsover to get them into the mainstream and make them competitive without an elaborate support system built and staffed by government workiers only a bit more gifted than they are, but paid for by you and me.. And what is the ethical argument for that? Only that it makes liberals feel good about stuff. You know it, I know it, and they know it.  Hopeless, and we can&rsquo;t even DICUSS it, but for rare exceptions like this one.</p>

		<p>The fact Hispanics (who are closer to whites or Asian than they are to African Americans) do poorly is proof this is a cultural phenominon and not a biological problem. Or the problem is white racism. I doubt anyone above 100 IQ or paying real attention believes that one. The main culprit must be the black-power and latino-power chip on the shoulder and racial activism. All these problems began as the smart-people convinced us world wide &#8216;anti-colonialism&rsquo; was the real problem and the smart-people got their was every step of the process. But the problems only got worse. No doubt the &#8216;smart&rsquo; and &#8216;concerned&rsquo; people will re-double their efforts anyway, only &#8216;racists&rsquo; will object to them.</p>
<p>If Asians do have some kind of innate advantage in smarts, on average, they are really making the most of their advantage. The only solution is to blame Asians for all problems in the world and pass more laws against them. Perhaps tie them down at school or at their desks. Don&rsquo;t give them any paper or books. . Goodness knows blaming whites for all problems hasn&rsquo;t helped any.    </p>

		<p>Improving the lives of blacks have &#8220;become a national priority&#8221; since the 60&rsquo;s.  The wasted money and effort have only brought what this article has pointed out.  And they dare come back for more?  Soon the whites will become the minority, and want to bet the preaching will still be the same?  Except what will be missing will be the money.  This country is presently broke.  The middle class is disappearing.  What will be the same will be the endless black poverty, crime, no schooling, screaming of what the whites did, and fatherless households with siblings by numerous different fathers.  Look no further than Africa and Haiti.  Money cannot change inferior genes.  At the end of the day, it all come down to genes.</p>

		<p>How interesting that these statistics seem to correlate so very nicely with IQ divides.  I wonder if there&rsquo;s a connection?</p>
<p>On a more serious note - I would bet money that the low white rate is due to intelligent whites being pushed out of the way for affirmative action blacks and mestizos.  That, unlike the forever present achievement gap, is a situation that we can and should rectify.</p>

		<p>As a California native, I am intimately (unfortunately) familiar with &#8216;Latinos&rsquo; - and Asians. I am less familiar with blacks I will concede. That said;</p>
<p>We are obviously looking at the IQ differential among the races. However, the raw data can still be misleading. For example; it&rsquo;s often said (accurately) that only 50% of &#8216;Latinos&rsquo; have a high school diploma. However, this number is arrived at by adding recent &#8216;Latino&rsquo; arrivals (like last nights border hoppers) to the US &#8216;Latino&rsquo; total. Hence, the 50% high school graduation rate for &#8216;Latinos&rsquo; reflects the fact that most of the &#8216;Latinos&rsquo; arriving in our country (mostly illegally BTW) are young men in their 20s and 30s without a high school education. It does not mean that 50% of US &#8216;Latinos&rsquo; are dropping out of high school. When high school drop out rates for US born &#8216;Latinos&rsquo; are tabulated, the number is about 15%. Granted that is a little over twice the white drop out rate.</p>
<p>Thus, data indicating that &#8220;16% of Latino men aged 25 to 34 had obtained an associate&rsquo;s degree or higher&#8221; is indicative of the fact that HALF the adult &#8216;Latino&rsquo; population consists of immigrants, most of whom came here in their late teens or as adults and never attended US schools in the first place.</p>
<p>P.S. I no longer live in my home state of California as the demographics are no longer favorable for whites - especially those who seek to raise a LARGE white family. Also, the US Census data on &#8216;Non-Hispanic&rsquo; whites in California is also misleading as they count Arabs, Turks, Iranians, Armenians, etc as white. Though I don&rsquo;t harbor hatred for non-whites, I do want to see the white race secure its existence - and a future for white children. And that is the true essence of valuing &#8216;diversity&rsquo; - as so eloquently stated by Dr David Duke.</p>

I never watch spelling bee&rsquo;s but I did one day and took note that there wasn&rsquo;t a single black on stage or in the audience.  Nearly everyone was white, Indian and Chinese.

		<p>When unedumacated, uncivilized sperm donors and brood mares produce offspring, it is a little unrealistic to expect that the offspring would become any more edumacated and civilized than the breeders were. One might say blacks place little importance on skills they don&rsquo;t need - after all, incarceration, which is so prolific among blacks, is one thing that requires no studying or passing.</p>

		<p>Why do these liberals force academics onto people who do not want it? It&rsquo;s cruel and tiresome. I have known blacks and hispanics who are intelligent enough for higher education. They weren&rsquo;t AA appointees, but competent academics. I haven&rsquo;t known that many blacks as such, but there were some. I have known more hispanic, confirming the statistics. One of my professors in college was Mexican. He was not a racist radical, but a competent engineer, and fair to all. (I know that la Raza professors are common, I don&rsquo;t deny that.) Some students, of all races, simply don&rsquo;t want to study. If you keep giving them welfare and allow them to act up without consequence, the situation will continue to deteriorate. AA and welfare exacerbates crime and incompetence, as we know. We need zero tolerance. All education and hiring should be based on ability, nothing else. And if some kid with baggy pants wants to yell at the teacher all day (there are even white kids who do that), he should be thrown out of school and given a broom. &#8220;If you want to eat, sweep the floors and clean the toilets&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is changing, due to certain Asians (Chinese, Koreans, Japanese ) NOT desiring to be lumped with certain categories of S. Asians and PIs who are generally less intelligent and less successful.</p>
<p>The 2010 census listed the following <i>separate</i> categories for Asians and PIs:</p>
<p>Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Native Hawiian, Guamanian or Chamorro, Samoan, other PI (write in).</p>
<p>The state of California, for student demographic purposes, breaks down the Asian/PI sub-category even further and includes the categories above PLUS the following:</p>
<p>Alaska native, Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, Native Hawiian, Fijian and Tahitian</p>
<p>It is WHITES who are lumped in with the Middle East and North Africa   &mdash;   any complaints?  You are a Hateful Racist!</p>
<p>As for non-Hispanic White, the latest category used to insult and debase Euro-American Whites, <i>Resisting Defamation</i> writes the following: </p>
<p><i>This is an expression of hatred, supremacy, and bullying by the dominant media culture, and an attempt to smother white American diversity and nationality.</i></p>
<p><i>This term is sometimes defended as a US Census term but the haters, supremacists, and bullies who make that claim never use the parallel census terms   &mdash;   non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic Indian.</i></p>

		<p>What this &#8220;report&#8221; conveniently leaves out is the FACT that Asians/Indians are literally handed, on a silver platter mind you, college placements.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s like every time the compass points north, and it seems we might be getting close to truetopia, some little sadist twists the dial until it points west/south/east.</p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t know why anyone wastes time on an Associates or Bachelors.  The very ubiquity of these degrees has lowered their value to the equivalent of a GED/HSD.</p>
<p>Second, let&rsquo;s be honest, if you want to do well in College, not scrape along by your fingernails but _succeed_ in a way that lets you learn concepts and not rote material, you NEED a 115 IQ and a 3.7 or better GPA as proof of fluid intelligence and lasting commitment to some pretty hard study regimes.</p>
<p>And not everyone has that, even among whites.  If blacks and hispanics want to go to College, fine.  But why can&rsquo;t we just administer tests and focus primary education curriculum towards those students who have the real potential to make use of a degree?  We should be able to identify that population group by no later than 4th Grade.</p>
<p>Third, with all of our industry outsourced and the economy in turmoil because we are not introducing enough basic laborers to society that we have to import ethnic wage slaves, it seems that the emphasis is off.  Either we need to become a major player in heavy industry and high tech so that advanced degrees come down to more than &#8216;community organizing&rsquo;.  Or we need to reevaluate where our population is being unreasonably directed towards in a society that increasingly doesn&rsquo;t need advanced skill sets but basic Joe The Plumber ones.</p>
<p>Fourth, why assume that this is &#8216;abnormal behavior&rsquo;, simply because it doesn&rsquo;t match a white norm?  Are you honestly admitting that to enjoy white privilege requires you to be white in terms of social behavior and intelligence?  We don&rsquo;t assume that 56% of Whites are failing to achieve college degrees, compared to Asians&hellip;  Why won&rsquo;t anyone publish racial correlations for other ethnic groups and specifically those &#8216;in the home country&rsquo; like Mexico?</p>
<p>Finally, does NO ONE see what we are doing here in terms, not of fixing the problem but creating a caste` system?</p>
<p>Asians on top.<br>
Whites as middle management.<br>
Non-Asian &#8216;People Of Color&rsquo; at the very bottom.</p>
<p>What I wonder is whether men like Bloomberg with his &#8216;Suicide or Superpower&rsquo; propaganda campaign really believe what they say.  Because if you expect to functionally sustain an advanced society, you cannot paste on a new sticker, rendering group X as Americans, and not expect genetic as &#8216;cultural&rsquo; norms to change with the new label.  There is no universal cog identity as replacement population program.</p>
<p>The obvious proof of this is the home nation economic status itself.  If Mexico COULD BE America, don&rsquo;t you think they would be?!?  If black Africa (averaging 
<p>Again, this looks to me like a covert agenda to &#8216;yell loudly while doing nothing&rsquo; and thus implement by default a permanent caste` system: quota driven and _unyielding_ in it&rsquo;s corruptible influence (class apparently is not as bad as race).  Essentially, what has ruined India for millennia.</p></p>

		<p>What struck me is the low white rate.  I&rsquo;m embarrassed of that figure.  Whites are becoming more like blacks socially and it shows in declining achievement.  Asians just walk in and take over.  Emotionalism cancels IQ points quickly.  Whites better find some discipline themselves or soon, the IQ myth will be simply that, a myth.</p>
